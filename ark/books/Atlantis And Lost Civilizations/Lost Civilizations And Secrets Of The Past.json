Lemuria. Mu. Eden. These famous names always bring to mind fantasticimages of sprawling, flourishing civilizations and idyllic, utopian climes. Butdid they exist? The established archeological community would be quick torespond with an emphatic no. But more and more experts are coming forward now—inaddition to those who have been fighting to make their voices heard fordecades—declaring that, yes, these places did, in fact, exist in some form.The world is forever and always changing. Ocean levels have risen and falleninnumerable times over the millennia. We are just now realizing how even aseemingly miniscule change in sea level can completely alter the way we live. Sowhy is it so difficult to believe that there once existed vast and gloriouscultures that, along with their knowledge and histories, were lost to the sandsof time or the depthless waters of a great flood? Most people cite a lack of anytangible evidence to support this idea, but what they don’t know (or refuse toknow) is that there is evidence.This collection delves into many questions concerning these lost civilizations,including their sometimes gigantic and otherworldly inhabitants, their possiblecontact with advanced beings and aliens, their religions, and other lostknowledge from a past we all share.With no past, we can have no future. There is more to history if you know how tolook at it and where to look. Let these experts show you the way.—Michael Pye and Kirsten DalleyOctober 2011"},{"pageContent":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCANDALSBy Frank JosephCultural diffusionists believe that seafarers from the ancient Old World visitedNorth America and influenced its prehistory millennia prior to 1492. Theycontradict official versions of the past upheld by culturalisolationists—mainstream archaeologists who insist that such contact never tookplace because no credible evidence supporting it exists.Scott F. Wolter is a university-trained geologist and president of AmericanPetrographic Services in St. Paul, Minnesota. His firm is tasked to analyzeconstruction materials, and has been cited for professional excellence by theAmerican Association for Laboratory Accreditation. The object of Wolter’sscrutiny with which we are concerned was a 200-pound sandstone found inSeptember of 1898 by Swedish immigrant farmer Olof Öhman while clearing his landin the largely rural township of Solem, Minnesota. Lying flat and entwined inthe roots of a stunted 30-year-old aspen tree, the 30 × 16 × 6-inch slab wascovered on its face and one side with what resembled runic writing. Öhmanbrought his find to the nearest town, Kensington, where it was displayed at thelocal bank. Interested in finding out the truth concerning the stone, Woltersubjected it to rigorous scientific examination in 2000.Translated from Medieval Swedish, the front of the object reads:Eight Götalanders and twenty two Norwegians on [this] reclaiming/acquisitionjourney far west from Vinland. We had a camp by two [shelters?] one day’sjourney north from this stone. We were fishing one day. After we came home wefound ten men red with blood and death. Ave Maria. Save from evil.Inscribed on the side of the stone are the words, “There are ten men by the seato look after our ships fourteen day’s journey from this island. Year 1362.1[ch01.html#ch01not1]Although archaeologists dismissed it as a transparent hoax, further independenttesting by Newton Horace Winchell, a geologist at the Minnesota HistoricalSociety, confirmed that the weathering on the stone’s exterior indicated thatits inscription was approximately 500 years old. “There was strong support foran authentic Runestone date of 1362,” he concluded, “and little reason tosuspect fraud.”2 [ch01.html#ch01not2] Unfortunately, his 1910 report wasobscured by the denunciations of skeptics, who loudly proclaimed that the stonewas a ludicrous forgery. More advanced technological methods of examination toeither confirm the inscription’s medieval authenticity or conclusively debunk itwere not developed until the turn of the 21st century, when the object wasentrusted to Scott Wolter for analysis. He had actually never heard of theKensington Rune Stone and was therefore indifferent to the squabbles concerningits provenance.He began by using photography with a reflected light microscope, core sampling,and a scanning electron microscope. These tools revealed unmistakable signs ofsub-surface erosion requiring a minimum of 200 years to develop. In other words,the Kensington Rune Stone was buried for at least a century before Olof Öhmanexcavated it. Further examination of each individual rune through a scanningelectron microscope revealed a series of dots engraved inside three runes forthe letter “R.” These dotted runes, never before noticed on the stone by anyone,have only been found in one other place: 14th-century headstones in churchcemeteries on the island of Götland, off the coast of Sweden. The KensingtonRune Stone is inscribed with a 14th century date, and its text cites eightcrewmen from Götland. No less crucially, Wolter pointed out, “the rare, medievalrune called ‘the dotted R’ was not known to modern scholars until 1935, yet itoccurs on the Kensington Rune Stone, found in 1898. Interpretation: The presenceof ‘the dotted R’ indicates the Kensington Rune Stone inscription could onlyhave been carved during medieval times.”3 [ch01.html#ch01not3]image [../images/f0009-01.jpg]The Kensington Rune Stone on display at the Rune Stone Museum, in Alexandria,Minnesota. Photograph courtesy of Ancient American magazine, used withpermission.State-of-the-art testing at an award-winning laboratory in a controlled,scientific environment by a university-trained geologist confirmed Olof Öhman’sdiscovery of an authentic 14th-century memorial. One might imagine that Wolter’sunequivocal proof of Norse explorers in the Midwest 130 years before theofficial discovery of America would have provoked newspaper headlines everywhereand been applauded by archaeologists. On the contrary, he received mixed reviewsin the local press, while Scott Anfinson, the Minnesota state archaeologist, andRussell Fridley, former head of the Minnesota Historical Society, snubbed hismeticulous research, dismissing the Kensington Rune Stone as “a monument toScandinavian frontier humor.”4 [ch01.html#ch01not4]His pleas for peer review ignored, Wolter turned his attention to another,although entirely different object equally deprecated by the likes of Anfinsonand Fridley, in an effort to show that the Kensington Rune Stone was notanomalous, but part of wider evidence for the presence of overseas visitors inpre-Columbian America. The item he selected had been discovered on February 14,1889, along the Little Tennessee River, near the mouth of Bat Creek, about 40miles south of Knoxville. At the time, members of the Smithsonian Institution’sBureau of Ethnology’s Mound Survey Project were excavating three undisturbedNative American burial structures at the site, dated to circa AD 100. One ofthem, 28 feet across and 5 feet high, yielded nine human skeletons, togetherwith a small, congealed mass of metal objects resembling bracelets. Partiallyhidden under the back part of a male skull, a relatively flat, thin piece offerruginous (containing iron oxides), reddish-brown siltstone, 4.49 inches longby 2.01 inches wide, and engraved with an eight-letter inscription, was removedby archaeologist John W. Emmert.Because it was found and handled under unimpeachably professional circumstances,the Bat Creek Stone was not dismissed or discarded as a fake, the typical fateof such discoveries. Even so, it could not be admitted as evidence ofarchaeological heresy—that is, evidence of foreign contact in pre-Columbiantimes—so the Smithsonian archaeologists presumed, once again without proof, thatthe inscription had been copied from a Cherokee alphabet invented in 1821 bySequoyah, a métis (person of mixed heritage—usually half European, halfAmerindian) silversmith. As such, the Bat Creek Stone was featured at theSmithsonian Institution Museum in Washington, D.C., for the next 80 years, untilHenriette Mertz, a former code-breaker for the U.S. government’s cryptographydepartment, noticed that the object was actually engraved with Hebrew lettersand was improperly displayed upside down. She contacted Dr. Cyrus H. Gordon, arenowned scholar of Near Eastern cultures and ancient languages at BrandeisUniversity, who verified the Semitic identity of the script.image [../images/f0011-01.jpg]Tennessee’s Bat Creek Stone with 2nd-century paleo-Hebrew inscription.Photograph courtesy of Ancient American magazine. Used with permission.It reads from right to left: LYHWD (meaning “for Judea”). Gordon noted that abroken letter on the far left was consistent with the Hebrew glyph, mem, inwhich case the word would instead read: LYHWD[M] (“for the Judeans”).5[ch01.html#ch01not5] He recognized the script as similar to characters on Judeancoins of the 2nd century, and therefore dated the text, based on its distinctivelettering, from AD 70 to 135. This time-frame was corroborated by separatetesting performed during the mid-1970s, when “researchers also examinedsheet-copper bracelets found with the tablet. Their analysis revealed that thebracelets were made from a zinc-copper alloy commonly used in the Roman Empirebetween 45 BC and 200 AD.”6 [ch01.html#ch01not6] Later, in 1988, wood fragmentsfound with the inscription were carbon-dated to sometime between AD 32 and 769.Despite its discovery by the premiere archaeological organization of the day,the Smithsonian Institution, and despite the vaunted academic credentials ofeveryone involved and the laboratory testing performed by university-trainedprofessionals, the Bat Creek Stone was vigorously condemed as fraudulent bymainstream archaeologists. They even went so far as to sacrifice one of theirown on the altar of politically correct expediency, when John Emmert, theSmithsonian Institution archaeologist who found the artifact, was described asan alcoholic who faked the inscription to curry favor with his supervisor (anaccusation never made until the 1970s, by the way)—clearly a baseless,mean-spirited attempt to discredit Dr. Gordon’s work.7 [ch01.html#ch01not7] Theycontinued to insist that the inscription was Sequoyah’s Cherokee syllabary untilthey were forced to concede in 2004 that the text was indeed 2nd-century Hebrew.However, they still refused to allow its pre-Columbian origins. The Bat CreekStone, they now argued, must have been engraved by 19th-century Freemasons. Justwho these unidentified Freemason experts in 2nd-century paleo-Hebrew were,however, the skeptics were unable to say.Although any objective person would have by now rejected the official skepticismas wholly irrational, Scott Wolter was determined to subject the Bat Creek Stoneto the most rigorous scientific examination of its checkered career. From May 28to June 29 of 2010, attended by Dr. Barbara Duncan, Education Director at theMuseum of the Cherokee Indian, he performed a battery of tests on the artifact,then on indefinite loan to the McClung Museum at the campus of the University ofTennessee in Knoxville. Petrographic observations using reflected lightmicroscopy and microphoto were used to study the stone’s surface, followed byscanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. An Olympus SZX12 Zoom microscopewith a spot digital camera system was also brought into play. As Wolterconcluded:since we did not observe any orange-colored silty-clay in the grooves of theinscription, and the overall surface of the stone and the edges of the grooveswere polished at the time of discovery, the inscription had to have been madeprior to the excavation of the mound by John Emmert…. The complete lack oforange-colored, silty-clay residue in any of the characters of the inscriptionis consistent with many hundreds of years of weathering in a wet earth moundcomprised of soil and hard red clay…. The inscribed stone and all otherartifacts and remains found in the mound with it can be no younger than when thebodies of the deceased were buried inside the mound [during the 2nd century AD]8[ch01.html#ch01not8]The Bat Creek Stone’s ancient authenticity had been scientifically verified. Theskeptics were silenced, but strangely they showed no interest in testingWolter’s findings for themselves, nor did they welcome his work as a newopportunity to perhaps settle an old controversy one way or the other,regardless of its outcome.If the Norse Kensington Rune Stone and Hebrew Bat Creek Stone hinted at therange of cultures impacting prehistoric America, that diversity came forcefullyto light on October 5, 1877, when Chief Joseph of the Wal-lam-wat-kain, a bandof Nez Perce Indians, surrendered to units of the U.S. Cavalry near Chinook inthe north of what is now Montana. While in custody, a medicine bag hangingaround his neck was stolen. The pouch contained several symbolic items, but onethat attracted the most curiosity among the soldiers was a 1-inch-square bakedclay tablet engraved on both sides with an unfamiliar script. When questioned,Chief Joseph explained that “the tablet had been passed down in his family formany generations, and that they had inherited it from their white ancestors.Chief Joseph said that white men had come among his ancestors long ago, and hadtaught his people many things.”9 [ch01.html#ch01not9]image [../images/f0013-01.jpg]Chief Joseph’s Sumerian tablet at New York’s West Point Museum. Photographcourtesy of Ancient American magazine.The object was sent to New York’s West Point Museum, where it has beenwarehoused ever since. Around the turn of the last century, an Assyriologyprofessor at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago examined ChiefJoseph’s peculiar heirloom. An editor of the Journal of Near Eastern Studies,with a PhD from Johns Hopkins University, Robert D. Biggs readily determinedthat the script was a cuneiform receipt for a sacrificial lamb to help celebratethe promotion of someone named Enmahgalanna as high priestess of Nanna, god ofthe Moon.10 [ch01.html#ch01not10] This same lunar deity was worshipped insouthern Iraq, where his most famous shrine was the Great Ziggurat of Ur,originally known as E-temen-nigur(u), or the “house whose foundation createsterror.”11 [ch01.html#ch01not11] Still fundamentally intact, the monumentalstep-pyramid made of mud brick was originally 210 feet long, 150 feet wide, and110 feet high. Professor Biggs determined that Chief Joseph’s tablet dated toapproximately 2042 BC, when it was inscribed by the Sumerians.That these disparate events, so profoundly removed from the environs, time, andculture of Chief Joseph, should have been connected with him in a small tabletseems incredible, until we learn that the pouch in which it was found preservedhis most sacred possessions. Traditionally, medicine bags “contained items thatwould remind the warrior of home, of where he came from,” which is exactly howChief Joseph described the cuneiform square.12 [ch01.html#ch01not12] Moreover,as historical writer Mary Gindling points out:The mundane nature of the contents of the tablet argues against forgery.Cuneiform had only been deciphered in 1846, and the process was far fromcomplete even in 1877, so a would-be forger would had to have been an extremelywell educated individual, familiar not only with the ancient language itself,but with the shape of the tablets created by the ancient scribes.13[ch01.html#ch01not13]That being doubtful to the point of impossibility, especially in frontierAmerica, had seafarers from Mesopotamia actually been capable of navigatinghalfway around the world during our prehistory?image [../images/f0015-01.jpg]Georgia’s Hearn Stone offers a translatable text from 2nd millennium BC Sumer.Photograph courtesy of Ancient American magazine. Used with permission.This question was at least partially answered 33 years ago, when Dr. ThorHeyerdahl commissioned the construction in Iraq of Tigris, the faithfulre-creation of a reed-boat depicted in Sumerian temple art. He hoped to provethat the Sumerians possessed a martime technology sufficient for passage atleast as far as the Indus Valley, where he suspected there were fundamentallyimportant cultural links with Mesopotamia. Baked clay records dating from thelate 3rd millennium BC made ambiguous references to oceanic Sumerian voyages inreed vessels large enough to carry 28 tons of cargo.In early spring of 1978, Heyerdahl and his international crew maneuvered theirre-creation through the Persian Gulf to Pakistan and out into the Red Sea, butdue to military clashes throughout the region, they were denied harboreverywhere except Djibouti. Frustrated, Heyerdahl destroyed Tigris by burningher down to the waterline on April 3, even though she was still seaworthy aftermore than five continuous months afloat. He thus demonstrated the remarkablehardihood of Sumerian reed-boat construction, which would have renderedtransoceanic voyages feasible at the time the Indian leader’s tablet wasinscribed in the mid-21st century BC. It was this seafaring technology thatappears to explain not only his inherited memento, but other examples of ancientcuneiform found in America.Shortly after the Cherokee artifact came to light, “a Sumerian tablet withcuneiform writing was found beside ancient stone projectile points nearLexington, Georgia,” according to archaeologist, Dr. Gunnar Thompson. “Thetablet is from Ur-Nammuk, Iraq, and dates to 2040 BC,” the same year of ChiefJoseph’s object.14 [ch01.html#ch01not14] Cultural diffusionist researcher GloriaFarley told of a similar find made in the same state by a Mrs. Joe Hearn:In 1963, while digging a new flower bed on her property in northwestern Georgia,not far from the Chatahoochee River, her shovel had struck a small,pillow-shaped tablet made of lead…. The cuneiform script, according to Dr.Curtis Hoffman, describes how a scribe named Enlila was aware that it was the37th or 38th year of the reign of King Sulgi of Ur, which by our reckoning,would have been about 2040 B.C. It recorded the sale of sheep and goats, whichapparently had been transported overseas to America, for sacrifice to Utu, thesun-god, and the goddess, Lama Lugal.15 [ch01.html#ch01not15]The correct dates of Shulgi’s rule were 2029 to 1982 BC. Nevertheless, Georgia’sHearn artifact and Chief Joseph’s tablet—separated by many hundreds of miles andfound nearly a century apart—both date to within 11 years of each other, thusunderscoring their common authenticity. The period they share throws new lighton their appearance in North America. Archaeologists know it as the ThirdDynasty of Ur, or Ur III, a 21st- to 20th-century BC Sumerian ruling dynastybased in the city of Ur after several centuries of Semitic domination. Shulgipromulgated an expansionist policy that included the broadest commercial tiesever extended by Sumer. If ever in that culture’s history its mariners hadsailed to America, it would have been during that dynasty. Today the HearnTablet is in the possession of LaGrange College, Georgia’s oldest privatecollege, which was founded in 1831.Still another cuneiform tablet dating to the Neo-Sumerian Empire was found nearQuaker City, Ohio, in 1978 by an amateur Indian arrowhead collector, whosubmitted his discovery to David Owen, professor of Near Eastern Studies atCornell University, in Ithaca, New York. Owen established its ancient provenanceand determined that the text had been authored “by a man named Ur-e’e in themonth of Dumuzi (late June), in the year (circa 2030 BC) the ensi (ruler) ofKarzida was elevated.”16 [ch01.html#ch01not16] The inscription returns fullcircle to Chief Joseph’s tablet, with its reference to Nanna, because Karzidawas the moon-god’s second city of worship.What particularly distinguishes these cuneiform-inscribed items is theirunreserved verification by mainstream archaeologists, who freely admit that allthree tablets are authentically Sumerian. Amazingly, they also uniformly andautomatically assume that the items were brought to North America by moderncollectors, because such items simply could not have arrived here any other way.Professor Owen “suggests that we are not to make too much of the [Quaker City]find, since ‘tablets of this type were sold throughout the U.S. in the earlyyears of this [20th] Century, and have shown up in various places, includinggarbage dumps and garage sales.’”17 [ch01.html#ch01not17] But that does notexplain Chief Joseph’s tablet, which became public knowledge in 1877, more than20 years before the alleged importation of Sumerian relics, nor the HearnTablet, which was dug up on property that had been in the discoverer’s familysince 1850. The Quaker City tablet was excavated from a depth of some 2 feetamid a cluster of Indian arrowheads—hardly the setting for a misplaced trinketfrom the early 20th century.Moreover, a thorough Internet search by this author has failed to turn up anyindication that brisk sales in authentic cuneiform tablets occurred in theUnited States during the early 1900s, as Professor Owen stated (again, withoutproof). The very notion that museum-quality artifacts from ancient Sumer wouldhave been sold off in large quantities to the general public, like bubble gum orcheap trinkets, seems absurd. Professor Owen blandly made the astoundingrevelation that “many such Ur III tablets have been found in the U.S., includingsome tablets dug up a few years ago from the ruins of an old apartment house inAuburn, New York.”19 [ch01.html#ch01not18] His thorough disinterest in thesefinds was based on the entirely groundless assumption that each one of them wasan early 20th-century import. Because his education programmed him to believethat our continent was impervious to all outside influences prior to Columbus,his mind was closed to any other explanations for the appearance of Sumeriantablets in America. But even his facile dismissal of their significance cannotaccount for wholly different cuneiform inscriptions found in South America.During 1959, a construction worker accidentally dug up an unusual bowl on theproperty of a the Manjon family, not far from the pre-Inca ruins of Tiahuanaco,the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power 44 miles west of LaPaz. The chestnut-brown fired ceramic bowl unearthed not far from Tiahuanacoseems unremarkable at first glance. It is 2.4 inches deep and 5 inches wide,engraved overall with zoological motifs and anthropomorphic charactersintersecting two different scripts. While one of these scripts is entirelyunlike any known written language, the other is identifiably cuneiform, whichwent unnoticed by members of the Manjon family. Magna Fuente, or the “greatfountain,” refers to an area of the family’s property where the artifact wasfound. The Bolivian archaeologist Don Max Portugal-Zamora confirmed its pre-Incaprovenance and completed some minor repairs.image [../images/f0018-01.jpg]The inner rim of Peru’s La Paz bowl features a cuneiform text in ancientSumerian. Photograph courtesy of Ancient American magazine.For more than 40 years the bowl was mostly forgotten, until a related find wasmade in December 2001, again near Tiahuanaco, less than four miles west of theruins, at another pre-Inca site known as Pokotia. Inside a pyramidal hill, anexcavation team led by professional archaeologist Bernardo Biados dug up a350-pound, 5-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide stone statue, broken at the feet and neckand with almost entirely eroded facial features. The male figure stands upright,with its arms at its sides (ribs are indicated by four lines on either side ofthe chest), a loincloth-like garment about its hips, and simple armbands aroundboth wrists. The puffy headgear atop its head is identical to similarrepresentations found at Tiahuanaco’s semi-subterranean court. Inscrutablesymbols and cuneiform script spill over its back and onto the fronts of itslegs.When the Pokotia Monolith was removed to La Paz’s Museum of Precious Metals(formerly known as the Gold Museum) on Calle Jaén, it was joined by the MagnaFuente object in 2007, when this object’s similarly cuneiform text was recalledfor comparison. Dr. Alberto Marini, a recognized authority in ancientMesopotamian languages, determined that the Magna Fuente inscription wasSumerian, and identified the artifact as a libation bowl. Although the wordingadorning the colossus has likewise been identified as Sumerian, it is stillawaiting proper translation.The cuneiform evidence supports numerous cultural comparisons betweenMesopotamian and Andean civilizations. “Both Sumerians and Peruvians,” Dr.Thompson observes, “believed in the existence of a holy mountain with twinpeaks, where the Sun rested during the night. Sumerians called their twin peaksMashu; among the Inca, it was known as Machu Picchu.”19 [ch01.html#ch01not19]The very word Inca appears to be derivative of the Sumerian Enki; both mean“great lord.” The Great Ziggurat of Ur described previously bears an uncannyresemblance to contemporaneous stepped pyramids found at Chicama, along thenorthwest coast of Peru. “Both Mesopotamian and Peruvian structures,” points outDr. Thompson, “were made from sun-dried bricks.”20 [ch01.html#ch01not20] Thepre-Inca origins of both the Magna Fuente bowl and the Pokotia Monolith are asauthentic as their cuneiform inscriptions. Yet, David Hatcher Childress,president of the World Explorers Club, who visited both finds,wondered if this discovery and decipherment would change the prevailingarchaeological attitudes in the Americas, or if mainstream archaeologists—theexperts—would just ignore this evidence of transoceanic interaction, as theyhave done on numerous, other occasions. Perhaps this bowl and statue could notbe conveniently destroyed or hidden, but they have been relegated to a fairlyobscure museum and summarily ignored for the past eight years.21[ch01.html#ch01not21]Combined with these Bolivian revelations, the Ur III tablets—five among possiblydozens more Owens found in the States—should have, at the very least, promptedarchaeologists everywhere to reconsider possibilities for Sumerian influences onAmerican prehistory. But none of them had anything to say. What could have beenthe beginning of an entirely new understanding of our deep past, based onauthentic, officially recognized physical evidence, never took place. Instead,the same shop-worn—indeed, obsolete and even erroneous—official version ofantiquity is repeated unchanged despite all facts to the contrary. Promulgatedfor more than 100 years, even up to the present day, by America’s educationalsystem, print media editors, and television programmers, this version isaccepted by most Americans, who are still kept in the dark regarding the MagnaFuente bowl, the Pokotia Monolith, and the Sumerian tablets.They would find incredible and outrageous Childress’s suggestion that mainstreamarchaeologists—respected scientists, mind you!—would be capable of deliberatelyhiding or destroying “subversive” evidence, perhaps even priceless artifacts. Atone time, so did Ivan T. Sanderson, an extraordinary naturalist who earned hisBA in zoology with honors from Cambridge University, where he later earned MAdegrees in botany and geology. His books Animal Treasure, Caribbean Treasure,and Living Treasure, published starting in the late 1930s, are still regarded asclassics of nature writing.22 [ch01.html#ch01not22] He wrote 16 books in allabout nature and his world travels. In the following decade, he coined the termcryptozoology for the scientific investigation of unknown plant and animal life,a discipline he founded. “Sanderson’s behavioral observations in the animals’natural environments were invaluable.”23 [ch01.html#ch01not23] For more than 30years, his numerous articles about wildlife were featured in True, SportsAfield, Argosy, and the Saturday Evening Post. Beginning in the early 1950s, hewas among the first televised zoologists to bring live animals on talk programs,such as The Johnny Carson Show, where he was a frequent guest.Before Sanderson’s death in 1973 at 62 years of age, he received a letter from aformer Navy Seabee in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During 1943, whilestationed on the small Aleutian island of Shemya, he oversaw crewmen clearingland for the construction of a 10,000-foot-long airstrip, when they bulldozedwhat they imagined was a series of low hills. About 2 miles long, Shemya is thesecond to last island in the chain of Aleutian Semichi Islands, approximately200 miles from Russian territory, and believed to have never been inhabited. Theengineers’ work came to a sudden halt, however, after removal of severalsedimentary layers exposed a field of human skeletal remains. The engineersrealized at once that what they mistook for hillocks were actually burial moundsfilled with hundreds of skulls and primarily thigh bones.Although a remarkable enough find in itself, the inadvertent excavators wereamazed to observe that the crania of the skulls measured from 22 to 24 inchesacross from base to crown. An adult human male skull normally measures 8 inchesfrom back to front. Closer examination showed that the skulls had beenartificially elongated from infancy in a process called ritual head deformation,which was known to both the Inca and pharaonic Egyptians. It was used tophysically distinguish royalty and aristocracy from the lower orders of society.The engineers also noticed that a neatly cut hole appeared in the upper portionof each skull, the result of trepanning, a pre-modern form of brain surgerypracticed by physicians in ancient Peru and the Nile Valley.After the military officers notified their superiors in Washington, D.C.,archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institution arrived at Shemya, carefullycollected all the bones, and departed without a word of explanation. The letterwriter stated that his efforts to learn whatever became of them wereunsuccessful, remarking that the bizarre skeletons never received any publicity,and asked the famous zoologist for assistance. Sanderson corresponded withanother Army Corps of Engineers veteran of the Shemya discovery, who confirmedthe U.S. Navy Seabee’s version in every detail. Despite Sanderson’s prestige asa world-class scientist, his repeated requests to Smithsonian Institutiondirectors, whom he knew personally for many years, insisted that no wartimecollection of unusual human remains in the Aleutians ever took place, and thatno records documenting such an undertaking ever existed. He was convinced theywere lying, and wondered aloud, “Is it that these people cannot face rewritingall the text books?”24 [ch01.html#ch01not24]Tragically, the Smithsonian’s handling of this most inconvenient evidence atShemya was not the only such instance of suppression and manipulation of thefacts. In 1908, the Institution commissioned G.E. Kincaid to make the firstphotographic record of the Grand Canyon. Traveling down the length of theColorado River, Kincaid found more than he bargained for when he entered amassive system of caverns containing military “barracks” stacked with edgedweapons and mummified human remains surrounded by hundreds of breastplates,shields, ornaments, and tools. A Buddha-like statue stood atop an altar in itsown shrine room, its walls adorned with hieroglyphic script.Responding to his submitted report, the Smithsonian dispatched S.A. Jordan atthe head of expedition team members, who were led by Kincaid to the cavern site.They carted out load after load of artifacts, then sealed the cave entrance withan iron gate. Returning to Yuma, Arizona, Professor Jordan announced at a pressconference that another, larger expedition, comprising 30 or 40 archaeologists,geologists, surveyors, and photographers, was being prepared for a majorscientific assault on the cave and its contents. The story was headlined by theArizona Gazette as “Explorations in the Grand Canyon. Mysteries of Immense RichCavern Brought to Light,” on April 5, 1909, and was followed by a series ofminor articles. But that was the end of all public discussion of the discovery.Numerous inquiries during the last 100 years have been met with consistentdenial by the Smithsonian Institution that such a find was made or such anexpedition on its behalf was ever launched. But decades of determined effortundertaken by skeptics to prove that editors of the Arizona Gazette engaged in ahoax came to nothing. The alleged cartloads of artifacts removed from the GrandCanyon have disappeared, along with all of G.E. Kincaid’s photographs.25[ch01.html#ch01not25]A relative misdemeanor in this checkered history of archaeological scandals tookplace in 1948, when Smithsonian Institution directors ordered that theKensington Rune Stone—then on loan to the museum—be entirely scrubbed withkerosene, scouring off every trace of original dirt and roots still clinging toit from the day it was found, 50 years prior.26 [ch01.html#ch01not26]Preservation of the artifact’s original condition was crucial in affirming theauthentic circumstances of its controversial discovery, something SmithsonianInstitution scientists would have fully understood.But even worse than the damaging or suppression of embarrassing evidence hasbeen the destruction of professional careers of non-conforming colleagues byestablishment archaeologists. “There used to be more freedom of thought andexpression, less worry about what peers said,” Michael D. Coe told Americasmagazine. “Today, there’s sort of an academic mafia that runs things. You lineup outside these hotel rooms during conferences, wait for a job interview. Ifyou say the wrong thing, you’re bad, and you don’t get in…. There are reputablepublications that won’t accept papers written based on anything but stuff dug upby archaeologists.”27 [ch01.html#ch01not27]Coe uttered these words after his retirement in 1996. He is still among the mostfamous and respected scholars today, the leading figure in Olmec archaeology.During the mid-1960s, his excavation at San Lorenzo (Veracruz) pushedMesoamerican chronology back 1,000 years, and identified the Olmecs as ourcontinent’s first civilizers. He was for 35 years a professor of anthropology atYale University and curator of the Peabody Museum, in New Haven, Connecticut.His more than a dozen published books influenced a generation of readers andestablished him as the recognized doyen of Olmec studies. “Well, if I werecoming up for tenure now, when deconstruction reigns supreme within the entireacademic universe,” Coe confessed to Americas magazine, “I probably wouldn’t getin.”28 [ch01.html#ch01not28]During his long years of tenure, he kept his diffusionist opinions to himself.“There are so many resemblances between mental systems of Bali and Mesoamerica,it got to the point I could predict what they [the Balinese] were going to donext from my knowledge of the Maya. Truly amazing! […] I’m looking at mentalsystems, cosmological systems, which are almost identical on both sides of thePacific.”29 [ch01.html#ch01not29] Coe’s previous training as a CIA operative forthe front organization “Western Enterprises” in Taiwan no doubt enabled him tomaintain the silence necessary to save his career from premature termination.30[ch01.html#ch01not30] His experience reflects poorly on the condition of modernarchaeology, where a valid line of scientific inquiry—the seminal connectionsbetween prehistoric Indonesia and Mesoamerica—was closed by what he termed “anacademic mafia that runs things.”31 [ch01.html#ch01not31]As a world class authority on the ancient Near East, Dr. Cyrus Gordon himselfknew that “no politically astute member of the establishment who prizes hisprofessional reputation is likely to risk his good name for the sake of a truththat his peers (and therefore the public) may not be prepared to accept forfifty or a hundred years.”32 [ch01.html#ch01not32]Indeed, accredited archaeologists who speak up for cultural diffusion find theirreputations ruined and themselves banished from their own profession. During themid-1970s, Virginia Steen-McIntyre was conducting research at a newly discoveredancient habitation site as part of her PhD dissertation at the University ofIdaho. Hueyatlaco (pronounced, “way-at-la-co”), about 70 miles southeast ofMexico City, yielded an abundance of prehistoric evidence. Usingstate-of-the-art radiometric methods and instruments, she and her similarlyuniversity-trained colleagues in the Harvard-funded Valsequillo Projectcompetently and repeatedly dated the remains of a man-made fire that had burneda quarter of a million years ago. A sacred tenet in the doctrine of mainstreamarchaeology holds that the first humans to cross a land-bridge from Siberia intoAlaska arrived in Middle America no earlier than 11,000 years ago.In response, “a branch of the [Mexican] federal government descended on Juan[one of Steen-McIntyre’s colleagues at the site], confiscating all his fossilsand artifacts, everything discovered during the Valsequillo Project, togetherwith his bone collection at the University of Puebla’s anthropology departmentand all his equipment. Everything was removed to Mexico City. He was forbiddenby law to do any more field work, ever. Frustrated, the government-sponsoredprofessionals claimed in print that all the artifacts at Hueyatlaco had beenplanted by workers.”33 [ch01.html#ch01not33]Her own treatment back in the United States was hardly any better. As MichaelCoe predicted, no editor was willing to publish Steen-McIntyre’s findings forpeer review in any scientific periodical. In the 10 years she struggled withoutsuccess to get her work into print, she was given no opportunity for furtherwork in her profession, until she could no longer make a living as anarchaeologist. Virginia Steen-McIntyre was what conventional scholars label a“rogue professor”—a kind of mad scientist meriting that appelation, becauseclearly someone like this would have to be crazy not to believe consensusreality! Establishment archaeologists Robert C. Mainfort, Jr., and Mary L. Kwasso categorized Professor Gordon, who dared to assert that Tennessee’s Bat CreekStone had been engraved with a 2nd-century Hebrew inscription. They referred tohim as “an archetypical example of what Williams has referred to as ‘rogueprofessors.’ Despite their academic trappings, rogue professors ‘have lost theabsolutely essential ability to make qualitative assessments of the data theyare studying,’ while often ignoring scientific standards of testing andveracity. Lacking the critical standard of most scholars, rogue professors ‘havethe opportunity to rogue or defraud the public….’”34 [ch01.html#ch01not34]After obtaining his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, Cyrus Gordon was ateacher at Brandeis for 18 years. He served as director of New York University’sCenter for Ebla Research, spearheading work on that ancient Syrian city. Hetaught classes and seminars and published work in field archaeology, glyphicart, cuneiform law, the Amarna letters, the Bible, Hebrew language, Ugaritic,Aramaic magic bowls, Nuzi tablets, Minoan Linear A, Homer, Egyptology, Coptic,Hittite, Hurrian, Sumerian, and Classical Arabic. These are the “academictrappings” Mainfort and Kwas stated were used by Cyrus Gordon to “defraud thepublic” with ideas they found offensive. How their own “academic trappings”might stand up to his could make for a revealing comparison.In any case, these same skeptics who called him names pounced on other,independent investigators as “cult archaeologists,” whose conclusions areworthless because they are not specialists in archaeology. Dr. J. HustonMcCulloch, Professor of Economics and Finance at Ohio State University, andtranslator of international economics papers from their original Frenchlanguage, was thus peremptorily dismissed for championing the Bat Creekinscription’s pre-Columbian provenance, because he is not a university-trainedarchaeologist, even though he is a university-trained scientist and professionallinguist. In other words, only accredited archaeologists—and only those whothink within the academic box—merit a hearing. Those who doubt official versionsof the past are either too eccentric to be taken seriously or unqualified tooffer contrary views. Everyone else should just sit down, shut up, and nod inagreement to whatever they are told by the “experts.”How did such a deplorable state of affairs come to pass?The answer lies with John Wesley Powell, the father of American archaeology.This politically connected, willful director of the Smithsonian Institution’sBureau of Ethnology laid down the law for all professional archaeologists fromthe late 19th century to the present: “Hence, it will be seen that it isillegitimate to use any pictographic matter of a date anterior to the discoveryof the continent by Columbus for historic purposes”35 [ch01.html#ch01not35][emphasis mine]. He insisted that the Americas had been hermetically sealed offfrom the rest of the outside world by impassable, oceanic barriers until 1492.All apparent evidence for pre-Columbian influences from Europe or elsewhere atwork here was henceforward officially forbidden as inadmissible and unworthy ofscientific discussion. Any evidence of ancient Old World impact on America couldonly be either a misinterpretation of the native culture or a deliberate hoax.Therefore, merely considering such evidence was to engage in either folly orfraud. Although Powell’s adamantine position assumed the aura of academic law,it was not the outcome of deliberate study or evaluation of evidence, but ofreligious bigotry.He had been born and raised the son of a poor, itinerant New York Protestantpreacher who ignited in his son a religious fervor that burned for the rest ofhis life. During the 1840s, when John was still a child, his father ragedconstantly against the nearby rise of Mormonism, which he condemned as the worstheresy. The boy grew up despising its founder, Joseph Smith, a hatred henurtured into adulthood. As some indication of the mutual animosity betweenPowell and the Church of the Latter Day Saints, while he was exploring the GrandCanyon during 1869, he escaped an ambush in which three of his companions werekilled in a Wild West—style shoot-out with Mormons.36 [ch01.html#ch01not36] Hisemphatic denial of any overseas contacts throughout pre-Columbian times was avisceral reaction to everything they believed, including Joseph Smith’scontention that waves of immigrants from the Near East had begun arriving inAmerica around 4,000 years ago.In defending Protestantism from the blasphemous Mormons, Powell embraced theabolitionist movement, which he expanded to include Native American Indians. Hefelt they had been insulted by the Mormons and other like-minded diffusionists,who falsely attributed the monumental earthworks of prehistory to transoceanicforeigners. Out of his life-long religious hatred arose the doctrine of culturalisolationism, of which he is still its patron saint to establishmentarchaeologists. Lake Powell, a reservoir on the Colorado River straddling theborder between Utah and Arizona, was named in his honor. In 1974, the UnitedStates Geographical Survey National Center in Reston, Virginia, was dedicatedthe John Wesley Powell Federal Building. The USGS’s highest recognition ofpersons outside the federal government is the John Wesley Powell Award.Far more significant than such official deification is the pervasive influencehis Victorian Era doctrine still exerts on the education and outlook of21st-century American archaeologists. His narrow-minded dogma has stunted theirdevelopment and deprived them of any original discoveries for more than 100years. Any meaningful finds have resulted from the efforts of either amateurswholly disconnected from Academia, or professionals in other disciplines. Whileconventional scholars kept repeating John Wesley Powell’s mantra of noforeigners in America “anterior to the discovery of the continent by Columbus,”microbiologists confirmed the existence of DNA from a Near Eastern populationgroup that inhabited the Hills of Galilee in northern Israel 2,000 years ago,among “pure blood” Native American Cherokee Indians.37 [ch01.html#ch01not37]With this revelation, the question of pre-Columbian Hebrews in North America hascome full circle from Scott Wolter’s independent confirmation of the Bat CreekStone inscription as authentically ancient. Such a history-altering discoverywas beyond the scope of mainstream archaeologists, made instead by professionalinvestigators in different lines of research: genetics and geology.Thankfully, these ongoing disclosures are severely eroding mainstreamarchaeology’s hitherto unassailable position. Previously, cultural diffusionistshoped that one day the stubborn defenders of John Wesley Powell would bedisabused of his outdated gospel by the sheer weight of persuasive evidence.That strategy has itself been rendered obsolete by an escalating barrage ofcontrary data fired with devastating effect from other disciplines at Academia’sivory tower. It cannot survive such a lethal pounding, and must collapse of itsown exposed weaknesses. From its ruins will ascend the New Archaeology, based,unlike its predecessor, on the forgotten principles of science—namely, that allevidence is at least initially worthy of fair assessment, and that conclusionsmust be allowed to freely arise only from the facts, minus any interference frombias or preconceived dogma.The moment Powell declared that any consideration of overseas impact onpre-Columbian America was “illegitimate,” he doomed archaeology to its presentcrisis and imminent demise. As an intelligent man living at a time of swiftchange, he should have realized that if there is any constant in the history ofscience, it is that yesterday’s theoretical impossibility is the scientificreality of today.NOTES1 [ch01.html#ch01not1a].

And whatof the famous legends of a great and universal Deluge that are found in so manyancient cultures? Could there really have been a vast global inundation thatdrowned entire populations and submerged settlements throughout the world, to beenshrined in legend by the few survivors whose descendants repopulated theworld?I’ve spent my lifetime researching history’s mysteries—from mythical monstersand peculiar peoples to arcane artifacts and lost lands. In nearly every case Ihave found a truth behind the legend—a small yet significant fact like the grainof sand at the heart of a pearl. The great majority of human history (or rather,pre-history) occurred in a world very different from the one we now inhabit. Upuntil 10,500 years ago, vast amounts of the Earth’s waters were frozen intocontinent-spanning, miles-thick sheets of ice covering much of North America andNorthern Europe, and the sea levels were hundreds of feet lower than they aretoday, exposing as dry lands the vast areas of the continental shelves. Thisperiod of time, called the Würm Glaciation, lasted for 59,500 years.The choice locations for human settlements have always been at the places whererivers empty into the sea. Along with fresh water from the rivers and theabundance of seafood, there are also easy means of transportation—upriver andalong the coastline. When the last Ice Age ended 10,500 years ago with theimpact of a large comet or asteroid in the Bahamas, the melting ice raised thesea levels 400 feet, and the new coastlines moved hundreds of miles inland,inundating more than 10 million square miles of formerly habitable land. Becauseall coastal communities were thus drowned, those few people who had survived inthe uplands passed down legends of sunken lands, lamenting lost paradises.Today all such once-prime real estate is now submerged hundreds of feet beneaththe oceans’ waves, and also under millennia of sediments still being depositedby the rivers that continue to flow inexorably into the seas. Such prehistoricsites are inaccessible to archaeologists of our time, and therefore will have tobe excavated by future generations.Some of these inundated settlements may have been quite significant. Submergedmegalithic ruins are being discovered in numerous places that were once dryland. These ruins include such structures as the still-debated Bimini Wall andother rectangular and pyramidal remnants at various offshore locations. In 1985,an enormous temple-like structure was discovered off the coast of thesouthernmost Japanese island of Yonaguni Jima. It is more than 165 feet long and65 feet wide, and its foundation lies 80 feet below the surface, with itshighest point just 16 feet beneath the waves.A few mysterious ancient monuments—such as the great Sphinx of Egypt’s GizaPlateau—are now thought to be far older than was once believed, the origins ofsome reaching back even further than 10,500 years ago.EDENThe ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hebrews all told of anEarthly Paradise that had once existed, but had been lost forever. According tothe Bible (Genesis 2:8–14):8 Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden, which is in the east, and there he putthe man he had fashioned. 9 Yahweh God caused to spring up from the soil everykind of tree, enticing to look at and good to eat, with the Tree of Life and theTree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the middle of the garden.10 A river flowed through Eden to water the garden; from there it was separatedinto four headwaters. 11 The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds throughthe entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 The gold of that land ispure; bdellium and onyx stone are also found there. 13 The name of the secondriver is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Kush.14 The third riveris named the Tigris and it flows to the east of Ashur. And the fourth river isthe Euphrates. (Jerusalem Bible © 1966)This seems to indicate a fairly precise geographical location near theconfluence of four well-known rivers. The Tigris and Euphrates, of course, arefamous to this day, as they form the boundaries of Mesopotamia, “the landbetween the rivers,” and meet at the head of the Persian Gulf. But where are thePishon and Gihon Rivers? No other rivers flow today through the desert sands tojoin the Tigris and Euphrates.Dr. Juris Zarins of Southwest Missouri State University believes that the Gardenof Eden now lies submerged under the waters of the Persian Gulf. He citesLandsat satellite images which reveal a “fossil river” that once flowed throughnorthern Arabia and through the now dry ravines (wadis), which modern Saudis andKuwaitis know as the Wadi Rimah and Wadi Batin. Furthermore, according to thebook of Genesis, this region was once rich in an aromatic gum resin (calledbdellium), which can still be found in north Arabia, and gold, which was stillbeing mined in that area in the 1950s. So the now-dry Rimah-Batin river wouldhave once been the Pishon.Zarins believes the Biblical Gihon is the Karun River, which has its source inPersia (modern Iran) and flows in a southwesterly direction toward the Gulf. TheKarun also shows in Landsat images, and contributed most of the sediment formingthe delta at the head of the Persian Gulf until it was diverted in 1765 throughthe Haffar Channel, which had been dug in 986 to facilitate shipping betweenAhvaz and Basra.During the Great Ice Age, vast amounts of water became locked up incontinent-spanning ice sheets, and sea levels fell by 400 feet, so that what isnow the Persian Gulf was dry land all the way to the Strait of Hormuz. It wasirrigated not only by the still-extant Tigris and Euphrates but also by the lostGihon, the Pishon, and their tributaries from the Arabian Peninsula and Iran.image [../images/f0034-01.jpg]Fig. 1: Eden and Dilmun. Map by the author.DILMUNThe Sumerians, who invented writing, recorded the legend of a luxuriant andlovely land called Dilmun, located on somewhat higher ground along the easterncoast of Arabia. Dilmun enters the epics in Sumerian creation myths of the thirdmillennium BCE. The by-then-ancient myth of a land of plenty, of eternal lifeand peace, had lodged firmly in the collective consciousness and a specificlocale.In the Sumerian epic Enki and Ninhursag, Enki, as lord of Ab (meaning “freshwater”), is living with his wife in the paradise of Dilmun:The land of Dilmun is a pure place, the land of Dilmun is a clean place,The land of Dilmun is a clean place, the land of Dilmun is a bright place;He who is alone lays himself down in Dilmun,The place, after Enki is clean, that place is bright (Kramer, 2007).Like the Biblical Garden of Eden, Dilmun was a peaceful place where “the lionkilled not, the wolf snatched not the lamb, unknown was the kid-killing dog,unknown was the grain-devouring boar” (Kramer, 2007). Nevertheless, Dilmun hadno water, and Enki hears the cries of its Goddess, Ninsikil, and orders theSun-God, Utu, to bring fresh water from the Earth for Dilmun. As a result:Her City Drinks the Water of Abundance,Dilmun Drinks the Water of Abundance,Her wells of bitter water, behold they are become wells of good water,Her fields and farms produce crops and grain,Her city, behold it has become the house of the banks and quays of the land(Kramer, 2007).Around 6000–5000 BCE came the Neolithic Wet Phase, when rains returned to theGulf region following a long arid period. The lands of present-day eastern andnortheastern Saudi Arabia and southwestern Iran, which had been dry and barren,became green and fertile. Foraging people moved into this paradisial regionwhere the four rivers now ran full. Agriculture began here, as humanity’s first“garden” was planted in the lush and fertile valley that we remember as Eden.But after 5000 BCE, the continued melting of Ice Age glaciers precipitated thesudden rise in global sea level called the Flandrian Transgression. The Gulfbegan to fill with water, finally reaching its current level around 4000 BCE,having swallowed Eden and all the settlements along the Gulf coast andeventually rising into the southern regions of today’s Iraq and Iran. Humankindwas driven from the Garden as Eden disappeared beneath the rising waters. It isinteresting to note that this sequence corresponds closely to the 4004 BCE datecalculated for the Creation by James Ussher (1581–1656), the Anglican Archbishopof Armagh in Northern Ireland.The modern world first learned of Dilmun when scholars deciphered cuneiformtablets from the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, an ancient Assyrianstronghold in modern Iraq, excavated by archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in the1840s. Some of these tablets comprise a narrative called the Epic of Gilgamesh,which describes a great Flood, a mighty Sumerian hero-king, and his search forthe Tree of Life.In the epic, King Gilgamesh goes down from Uruk in Sumer to Dilmun on the Gulfwhere he is informed by Utnapishtim, the nigh-immortal Sumerian Noah analog whosurvives the Great Flood, that the Tree of Life still grows beneath the waves,and that a sprig from it would grant immortality. Gilgamesh dives down, findsthe Tree (possibly coral, which is associated with immortality), and recovers asprig. Exhausted from this labor, he collapses on the shore to sleep, whereupona serpent comes along and steals the sprig, leaving its old skin behind as itdisappears into a hole. This story neatly explains why snakes perpetually shedtheir skins, and why they are thought to live forever.THE DELUGEThe Epic of Gilgamesh was compiled by a Mesopotamian priest namedSîn-leqi-unninni (“Sin [the moon god] accepts my prayer”) sometime between 1300and 1000 BCE out of older tales and legends. Tablet XI of the epic includes adetailed account of the Great Deluge as told to Gilgamesh by Utnapishtim. It istaken almost word-for-word from an 18th-century BCE Akkadian epic named afterits protagonist, Atrahasis, whose father, Ubara-Tutu, was king of Shuruppakbefore the flood.Tablet III of the Atrahasis Epic tells how Enki instructs Atrahasis (“extremelywise”) to dismantle his house and build a large boat to escape the flood plannedby the wind god, Enlil, to destroy the burgeoning human population. This ark isto have a roof and upper and lower decks, and is to be sealed with bitumen.Atrahasis builds the ark, takes his family and livestock aboard, and seals thedoor. Enlil’s storm comes and the land is inundated, frightening even the gods.After seven days the flood subsides, and Atrahasis emerges and offers sacrificesto the gods. Enlil is furious with Enki, but Enki argues, “I ensured thepreservation of life.” Enki and Enlil agree on other means for controlling thehuman population in the future.The very earliest version of the Deluge myth is preserved only fragmentarily inthe Eridu Genesis, written in Sumerian cuneiform and dating to the 17th centuryBCE, during the first dynasty of Babylon when Sumerian was still the writtenlanguage. In this version, it is Ziusudra who is the ark-building hero who saveshis family and animals.Of course, the Western world is most familiar with the Deluge story through thelater account of Noah given in the Bible. According to Genesis 6:6–8:Yahweh regretted having made man on the Earth, and his heart grieved. ‘I willrid the Earth’s face of man, my own creation,’ Yahweh said, ‘and of animalsalso, reptiles too, and the birds of heaven; for I regret having made them.’ ButNoah had found favor with Yahweh.So Yahweh instructs Noah to build a great boat—the ark—three decks high with aroof, and to seal it with pitch (bitumen). He tells Noah to take aboard hisfamily and seven of each kind of “clean” animal and bird, and two—a male and afemale—of each kind of “unclean” animal. According to Genesis 7:11–12, “In thesix hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, and on the seventeenthday of that month, that very day all the springs of the great deep brokethrough, and the sluices of heaven opened. It rained on the Earth for forty daysand forty nights….” Verses 18–19 go on to read, “The waters rose and swelledgreatly on the Earth, and the ark sailed on the waters. The waters rose more andmore on the Earth so that all the highest mountains under the whole of heavenwere submerged….” And in verse 24, “The waters rose on the Earth for a hundredand fifty days.”When the waters eventually subside, Noah’s ark comes to rest on Mount Ararat,which is located in modern Turkey. Utnapishtim’s boat lands on Mount Nisir inIraqi Kurdistan, only a few hundred miles away. Noah releases a raven once and adove twice; Utnapishtim releases three birds: a dove, a swallow, and a raven.Noah’s youngest son, Ham, has four sons—Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. Accordingto Genesis, their descendants became the Cushites (Africans), Egyptians, Putians(Persians), and Canaanites (Phoenicians), respectively.Bishop Ussher dated the Deluge of Noah very precisely to the year 2349 BCE, butthe historical reign of King Gilgamesh of Uruk is believed to have been muchearlier than that, approximately 2700 BCE, by which time the Flood was already adistant legend. So if the Great Deluge did, in fact, occur, when did it happen?In the epic, Atrahasis is identified as the son of Ubara-Tutu, who was the lastantediluvian king in Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) before “the flood sweptover” (Lambert and Millard, 1969). Excavations at that site have, in fact,discovered evidence of extensive flooding, which has been radiocarbon dated toca. 2900 BCE. The flood deposits extend as far north as the city of Kish,interrupting the continuity of settlement. The epic goes on to read: “After theflood had swept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, the kingshipwas in Kish,” where the next king after the flood was Ngushur. A date for theDeluge of ca. 2900 BCE makes perfect sense in terms of the sequence of Sumeriankings and the accounts in the epics of Gilgamesh and Atrahasis.Lately, however, a controversial new explanation for the legend of the GreatDeluge has been proposed by William Ryan and Walter Pitman, two seniorscientists from Columbia University. They postulate that rising sea levelscaused a massive transfer of water from the Mediterranean into the Black Seaaround 5600 BCE. Funneled through the narrow Bosporus, “[t]en cubic miles ofwater poured through each day, two hundred times what flows over Niagara Falls….The Bosporus flume roared and surged at full spate for at least three hundreddays” (Ryan and Pitman, 1998). The water level climbed about six inches a dayuntil 60,000 square miles of farmland were inundated. The Black Sea rosehundreds of feet, changing it from a landlocked freshwater lake into a saltwaterinland sea connected to the world’s oceans.image [../images/f0039-01.jpg]Fig. 2: The Inundation of the Black Sea. Map by the author.Such flooding would have had a catastrophic effect on the people living aroundthe area of the Black Sea, triggering mass migrations across Europe and theMiddle East.Many researchers now believe that the story of Great Deluge in the epics ofGilgamesh, Atrahasis, and Noah had its origin in this cataclysmic event. Shellsof nine species of saltwater and freshwater mollusks from the Black Sea wereradiocarbon-dated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. They found thatthe saltwater species ranged in age from 2,800–6,820 years, and the freshwaterspecies ranged from 7,460–15,500 years. Thus the inundation of the Black Seaoccurred between 6,820 and 7,460 years ago, or between 4,820 and 5,460 BCE. Sorather than confirming the flood of Gilgamesh, Atrahasis, and Noah, this eventactually correlates in time more closely to the flooding of Eden by the risingwaters of the Persian Gulf during the Flandrian Transgression which, as notedpreviously, began after 5000 BCE and reached its present level around 4000 BCE.Bruce Masse, an environmental archaeologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory,has a more radical theory about the Great Flood. Masse and his Holocene ImpactWorking Group believe that between 2800–3000 BCE, a gigantic comet 3 miles indiameter smashed into the Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar. The impactsite, called Burcle Crater, is about 18 miles in diameter, 25 times larger thanMeteor Crater in Arizona. Located at 30.865°S, 61.365°E, it is 12,500 feet belowthe surface.The impact sent 600-foot-high tsunamis crashing against the world’s coastlinesand released plumes of superheated water vapor and particulates high into theatmosphere. Within hours, the blast spawned superhurricanes on the other side ofthe planet. For about a week, the entire globe was plunged into darkness. Massebelieves that up to 80 percent of the world’s population perished, making thisevent the single most lethal catastrophe in human history. In the Gilgameshepic, Utnapishtim sees a pillar of black smoke on the horizon before the skygoes dark for a week. Afterward, a cyclone pummels the Fertile Crescent, causingthe legendary Deluge.Early Spanish explorers in Central and South America were surprised by Indianflood legends that sounded strikingly similar to the story of Noah. Some Spanishpriests feared that the Devil planted the stories in the Indians’ minds toconfuse them. “These stories are all exactly what you would expect from thesurvivors of a celestial impact,” Masse says. “When a comet rounds the sun,oftentimes its tail is still being blown forward by the solar winds so that itactually precedes it. That is why so many descriptions of comets in mythologymention that they are wearing horns.” In India, he notes, a celestial fish as“bright as a moonbeam” (Masse, 2007) with a great horn on its head, was said tohave warned of an epic Flood that inaugurated a new age of humanity.Among the 175 flood myths Masse examined, a Chinese version states that theGreat Flood occurred at the end of the reign of Empress Nu Wa. Cross-checkinghistorical records with astronomical data, Masse came up with a date for theevent of May 10, 2807 BCE. As mentioned previously, excavations at Shuruppakdiscovered evidence of extensive flooding dated to ca. 2900 BCE, which dovetailswith the accounts in the epics of Gilgamesh and Atrahasis. Masse’s datingfurther corroborates his theory that the Deluge of legend was caused by amassive comet impact at that time.Ancient people variously described comets as heavenly dragons, featheredserpents, celestial fish, or flaming swords. It is thus interesting to note thatin the Genesis account of the Fall, Yahweh “banished the man, and in front ofthe Garden of Eden he posted the cherubs, and the flame of a flashing sword, toguard the way to the Tree of Life” (Genesis 3:24).DOGGERLANDFar to the north, another vast inhabited land area was inundated around 8,000years ago. Now called Doggerland (after the Dogger Bank, known as a hazard tosailors and a boon to fishermen), this area stretched between England andDenmark, where the cold waters of the North Sea now roll. During the last IceAge, Doggerland was a broad expanse of the continental shelf—a wide, undulatingplain with a coastline of salt marshes, mudflats, and lagoons formed by themeandering rivers and lakes fed by melting glacial water from the continentalice sheets further inland. About the size of Great Britain, Doggerland may havebeen the richest hunting, fowling, and fishing ground in all of Europe duringthe Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) cultural era. In recent times, numerousartifacts have been dredged up from the North Sea, confirming human habitationduring this time.image [../images/f0042-01.jpg]Fig. 3: Doggerland beneath the North Sea. Map by the author.As sea levels rose after the end of the last glacial period, and continentalshelves subsided under the weight of water, Doggerland slowly sank beneath theNorth Sea. Around 6200 BCE, a massive submarine landslide off the coast ofNorway (called the Storegga Slide) caused a catastrophic tsunami which sweptover Doggerland and cut through the English Channel, severing the peninsula fromthe European mainland. Any inhabitants of this forgotten country would have beenswept away. The hilly Dogger Bank may have remained as an island until as lateas 5000 BCE, when, like Eden and the shores of the Black Sea, it was finallysubmerged by the Flandrian Transgression.LEMURIALemuria is the name of another submerged land that is hypothesized to haveextended from Madagascar through India and throughout Indonesia. The name wascoined in 1864 by the zoologist and bio-geographer Philip Sclater, to accountfor the presence of lemurs in these now widely separated areas. Lemurs (Latinfor “ghosts”) are charmingly cute primitive primates and our remote ancestors.Proposing that Madagascar and India had once been part of a larger continent,Sclater wrote:The anomalies of the Mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained bysupposing that…a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and IndianOceans…that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have becomeamalgamated with…Africa, some…with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar andthe Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, forwhich…I should propose the name Lemuria! (Neild, 2007, pp. 38–39)Although no “lost continent” ever filled the Indian Ocean basin, it is true thatthe islands of this region were originally part of a continuous land mass duringthe Ice Ages, when sea levels were far lower, exposing the continental shelves.The modern islands of Indonesia were once mountains of the vast area now calledSunderland, which extended almost to Australia.image [../images/f0043-01.jpg]Fig. 4: Lemuria and Sunderland. Map by the author.The idea of a lost continent in the Indian or Pacific Ocean was picked up bysome occult writers, who made it the home of various imagined races andcreatures. In the 1880s, Madame Helena Blavatsky (1831–1891) asserted that thegods sunk Lemuria in order to destroy its subhuman inhabitants. In 1894,Frederick Spencer Oliver published A Dweller on Two Planets, which claimed thatsurviving Lemurians were living in a complex of caves and tunnels beneathNorthern California’s Mount Shasta, and were occasionally seen walking on themountain in white robes. This belief is still popular today, as can be attestedby a visit to any occult bookstore in the town of Shasta.MUMu is the name of another vast land mass imagined to have once existed in thePacific Ocean, the remnants of which are New Zealand and Polynesia. This ideawas first proposed by Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), who claimed that his(bogus) translations of ancient Mayan writings told of this drowned land, whosesurvivors were the Mayan Indians of the Yucatan Peninsula. The Lost Continent ofMu was later popularized by James Churchward (1852–1936) in a series of ratherpreposterous books with that title.According to Churchward, Mu “extended from somewhere north of Hawaii to thesouth as far as the Fijis and Easter Island.” He claimed Mu was the site of theGarden of Eden, and had 64,000,000 inhabitants—known as the Naacals. Itscivilization, which supposedly flourished 50,000 ago, was technologically moreadvanced than that of Churchward’s own time, and the ancient civilizations ofMesopotamia, Egypt, India, and the Mayans were merely the degenerate remnants ofits colonies. Needless to say, there is no geological basis whatsoever for asubmerged Pacific continent.image [../images/f0045-01.jpg]Fig. 5: The Geographical Position of Mu (map adapted from The Lost Continent ofMu, 1926)ATLANTISBy far the most famous of all legendary lost civilizations is the fabled islandof Atlantis. Its historical existence and location have been debated for morethan 2,000 years, but have never been definitively confirmed. It was firstmentioned by the Greek philosopher Plato (427–347 BCE), who claimed the storyhad been passed down in his family from his great-grandfather, who knew Solon(638–558 BCE), a Greek statesman who had learned the account from priests whenhe visited Egypt in 560 BCE. Plato wrote down Solon’s story around 360 BCE inhis dialogues Timaeus and Critias, stating that Atlantis had been destroyed by avolcano, an earthquake, and/or a tsunami about 9,000 years prior to Solon’stime, or ca. 9600 BCE:[I]n front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, “the pillars ofHeracles,” there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together;and it was possible for the travellers of that time to cross from it to theother islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over againstthem which encompasses that veritable ocean…. (Plato, Timaeus 24-E)But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and onegrievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors wasswallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner wasswallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot hasnow become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud whichthe island created as it settled down (Plato, Timaeus 25-D).As the story goes, the paradisial island of Atlantis (meaning “land of thepillar”) belonged to Poseidon, god of the sea. He fell in love with a mortalwoman, Cleito, and built a palace for her on a hill near the middle of theisland, surrounded with “circular belts of sea and land enclosing one anotheralternately, some greater, some smaller, two being of land and three of sea,which he carved as it were out of the midst of the island; and these belts wereat even distances on all sides, so as to be impassable for man” (Plato, Critias113-D). Cleito bore five sets of twin boys who became the first rulers ofAtlantis. The island was divided among the brothers with the eldest, Atlas,becoming the first king of Atlantis. At the top of the hill, a temple forPoseidon was built. Here the rulers met to discuss laws, pass judgments, andhonor Poseidon.To facilitate travel and trade, a canal was cut through of the rings of land andwater running south for five and a half miles to the sea. The populous city ofAtlantis extended in an 11-mile circle around the outer ring of water. Beyondthe city lay a fertile plain 330 miles long and 110 miles wide, surrounded byanother canal to bring in water from the mountains.image [../images/f0047-01.jpg]Fig. 6: Map of Atlantis based on Plato’s description, originally published inthe New York American , Oct. 20, 1912.Soaring mountains dotted with villages, lakes, rivers, and meadows surroundedthe plain to the north. The mild climate allowed two harvests each year.Numerous varieties of herbs, fruits, and nuts grew in abundance. Large herds ofanimals, including elephants, roamed the island. For generations the Atlanteanslived simple, virtuous lives, but eventually they became corrupted by greed andpower. Angered by their immorality, Zeus convened the other gods to determine asuitable punishment. Subsequently, in “one grievous day and night,” Atlantis,its people, and its memory were “swallowed by the sea and vanished” (Ibid.).WHERE WAS ATLANTIS?Various different locales for Atlantis have been proposed over the years. Platosaid that Atlantis had been located “beyond the Pillars of Heracles,” which areunderstood to be the Straits of Gibraltar. This would place Atlantis out in theAtlantic Ocean—most likely around the Azores Islands, about 900 miles west ofthe Portuguese coast. In Atlantis: The Antidiluvian World, published in 1882,Ignatius Donnelly proposed that the Azores were the mountaintops of the sunkencontinent of Atlantis. These islands rise from a larger foundation called theAzores Plateau, known by mariners as “Dolphin Ridge.” About the size of Spain,this region is a discrete block encircled by the Mid-Atlantic Rift. The entireplateau would have been above water during the Ice Age, until an opening of thesurrounding Rift evacuated the underlying magma and dropped it into the hole.This happened around 10900 BCE, somewhat earlier than Plato’s date.image [../images/f0048-01.jpg]Fig. 7: Map of Atlantis from Mundus Subterraneus by Athanasius Kircher,Amsterdam, 1665.In 2007, planetary geologist Peter Schultz and a team of scientists from BrownUniversity presented evidence that a comet or asteroid exploded over the Earthor slammed into it 12,900 years ago, melting ice sheets, sparking extremewildfires, fueling hurricane-force winds, and triggering a catastrophic climatechange that killed off the mammoths, giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, and othergreat beasts of the Ice Age. A thin, black layer of carbon sediment dating to10900 BCE has been found in more than 50 archaeological digs in Canada,California, Arizona, and South Carolina—and even in Belgium. The same blacksediment was found at 10 archaeological sites associated with the Clovis people,the earliest humans known in the New World, who disappeared after that date.Directly beneath the black sediment, researchers found high concentrations ofmagnetized iridium, charcoal, soot, carbon spherules, fullerenes packed withextraterrestrial helium, and microscopic diamonds that could only have beenformed from the intense pressure and heat of an extraterrestrial impact. In thisscenario, around 12,900 years ago, a comet or asteroid crossed North America,scattering debris along its route and creating the oval-shaped craters known asthe Carolina Bays before smashing into the Atlantic Ocean. The impact site isknown as the Nares Abyssal Plain. Its proximity to the Puerto Rico Trenchtriggered the opening of the Mid-Atlantic Rift, releasing undersea magma andspewing vast amounts of volcanic ash into the atmosphere. The consequentdepletion of the magma chamber beneath the Azores Plateau caused the subsidenceof that volcanic land mass—identified by Donnelly as the original Atlantis. As aresult of this impact, the Earth’s geographic axis shifted, so that the NorthPole, which had been in the Hudson Bay, moved to its present location in themiddle of the Arctic Ocean (the magnetic pole is still catching up, by the way).image [../images/f0049-01.jpg]Fig. 8: The Azores Plateau and Ice-Age coastlines of the Atlantic Ocean. Map bythe author.During the Ice Age, large portions of Antarctica were ice-free and temperate.Some serious researchers place Atlantis there. In Maps of the Ancient Sea-Kings,published in 1966, Prof. Charles Hapgood of Keene College, New Hampshire, notedthat Antarctica appears on ancient nautical charts that long predate thediscovery of Antarctica by Capt. James Cooke in 1773–74. Some of these mapsappear to show coastal features now hidden beneath the ice. Hapgood proposedthat these charts were constructed from ancient source maps originating with asophisticated seafaring culture existing as early as 7000 BCE, and which hadbeen copied and recopied over many thousands of years. Hapgood pointed out thatcore samples from the Ross Sea area include pollen, indicating a relativelytemperate climate as late as 4000 BCE. He postulated that the ice fully engulfedAntarctica only after the polar shift that occurred around 9500 BCE, coincidingwith the end of the last Ice Age. Shultz’s findings would correct this dating to10900 BCE.Based on Hapgood’s theories of a pre-glacial Antarctica and a polar shift at theend of the Ice Age, Canadians Rose and Rand Flem-Ath proposed in their 1995 bookWhen the Sky Fell that Plato’s Atlantis was actually Antarctica. They pointedout that the polar continent matches Plato’s description in the Timaeus dialogof “an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together.” Furthermore,Antarctica certainly lies “beyond the Pillars of Heracles,” as Plato reported.However, the complete absence of any evidence of human structures or habitationin Antarctica pretty well refutes the argument for this location.Still other researchers place Atlantis in South America, and point to certaingeophysical features on the Bolivian Altiplano that match elements of Plato’sdescription, as well as to the ruins of Tiahuanaco—an ancient city considered bymany archaeologists to be the oldest in the world. Only 10 percent of its morethan 400 acres of ruins have been excavated. In the distant past, Tiahuanaco wasa flourishing port at the edge of Lake Titicaca, whose coastline has sincereceded 12 miles and dropped 800 feet. The lake continues to shrink fromevaporation, as no rivers flow into it. In 1980, Hugo Boero Rojo, a Bolivianauthor and scholar of pre-Columbian cultures, announced the discovery ofarchaeological ruins 45–60 feet beneath the lake’s surface. Polish-born Bolivianarchaeologist Hans Schindler-Bellamy concluded that the Tiahuanaco culturereached back 12,000 years before the present era.image [../images/f0051-01.jpg]Fig. 9: Tiahuanaco and Lake Titicaca. Map by the author.Salt deposits indicate that during the Ice Age, this lake was part of a vastinland sea that filled the entire Amazon Basin, so Tiahuanaco would have been aseaport at that time. But after the impact of 10900 BCE, the entire continent ofSouth America tipped eastward as the continent was moved further westward overthe Pacific tectonic plate. The west coast rose thousands of feet (the “AndeanUpheaval”), spilling the inland sea out into the Atlantic and raising Tiahuanacoto its present height of 13,300 feet above sea level. Interestingly, papyrusreeds—otherwise found only in Egypt—grow in profusion along the shores of LakeTiticaca; the local people construct boats from these reeds that are virtuallyidentical to those that have been used in Egypt for millennia. Whether or notTiahuanaco can be legitimately identified with Plato’s Atlantis myth, the siteis certainly indicative of an advanced level of civilization during the laterIce Age, perhaps one that that included sufficient seafaring skills to haveimported papyrus all the way from Egypt.image [../images/f0052-01.jpg]Fig. 10: A 19th-century map of ancient South America. Courtesy of theTheosophical Society.The most widely accepted proposed locale for Atlantis is that of Greekarchaeologist Spyridon Marinatos, who in 1939 stated that Plato’s description ofthe Atlantean civilization and its cataclysmic destruction seemed very much likethat of Bronze-Age “Minoan”1 [ch01.html#ch01not1] Crete, located at the southernedge of the Aegean Sea. Just 70 miles north of Crete is a volcanic island onceknown as Kallisti (“the prettiest one”), now called Thera. In 1628 BCE, anenormous volcanic explosion—10 times the size of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoain Indonesia—obliterated the entire central area of the island and devastatedthe magnificent Minoan civilization. The detonation hurled a plume of ash androck 20 miles into the stratosphere, turning day into night over the easternMediterranean Sea. Some settlements on Thera were buried under as much as 100feet of ash. Huge tsunamis drowned coastal Greece, Syria, and Egypt, and thevolcano below the horizon was visible for hundreds of miles as a “pillar ofsmoke by day, and fire by night” (Exodus 13:21). This was the event recorded inthe Bible as the Exodus; indeed, the 10 plagues that beset Egypt and theso-called parting of the Red Sea (a clear description of a tsunami) were all dueto these events.image [../images/f0053-01.jpg]Fig. 11: Thera as Atlantis. Drawn by the author after Galinopoulos.Marinatos argued that Solon may have confused the Egyptian glyphs for “hundred”and “thousand,” and that the destruction of Atlantis should have been read ashaving occurred 900 years earlier, rather than 9,000. If so, the proper datewould have been 1600 BCE—the time of the Thera eruption. Reducing the figures ofthousands to hundreds also brings Plato’s reported dimensions of Atlantis intoaccord with those of Thera.THE FLOOD OF DEUCALION AND PYRRHAThere [in Achaea, i.e. Greece] is a land encircled by lofty mountains, rich insheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, son of Iapetus, begat goodly Deucalion,who first founded cities and reared temples to the immortal gods, and firstruled over men. This land the neighbors who dwell around call Haemonia [i.e.Thessaly] (Argonautica, 3rd century BCE).According to Greek legend, Lycaon, king of Arcadia, sacrificed a boy to Zeus,king of the Gods. Appalled by this cannibalistic offering, Zeus decided topunish the children of the Titans for their wickedness and impiety by sending aflood to wipe them from the face of the Earth, thus putting an end to the Age ofBronze. The wise Titan Prometheus (whose name means “forethought”), ever defyingthe tyranny of Zeus, warned his 82-year-old son, Deucalion, the king of Phthiain the southernmost region of Thessaly in ancient Greece. Deucalion then built alarge ark, carefully provisioned, in which he and his wife, Pyhhra, the daughterof Prometheus’ brother Epimetheus (“afterthought”), rode out Zeus’ deluge, whichsubsequently swept over Greece and drowned all of its other inhabitants. Therivers ran in torrents, and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed thefoothills, and washed everything clean. (No animals were saved in this legend.)When the flood waters subsided after nine days, their ark came to rest on MountParnassus, where Deucalion was advised by an oracle of Themis to “cover [his]head and throw the bones of [his] mother behind [his] shoulder” (Argonautica).Understanding that the oracle was referring to Mother Earth (Gaea), they tossedstones over their shoulders, from which sprang up a new race of humans: men fromthe rocks thrown by Deucalion, and women from those thrown by Pyhrra. Theireldest son was Hellen, whose descendants became the Hellenes; his sons wereDorus, Xuthus, and Aelous—progenitors of the Greek Dorians, Ionians, andAeolians, respectively.Renaissance astronomer Seth Calvisius (1556–1615) gave a date of 1516 BCE forDeucalion’s Flood, while Christopher Helvicus (1581–1616), German professor ofGreek and Eastern languages at the University of Giessen, offered 1511 BCE. Mostresearchers agree that the deluge of Deucalion and Pyhrra was contemporary withthe Exodus of the Israelites, which can be confidently linked to the eruption ofThera, now dated to 1628 BCE. The flood waters would have been the 50-foot hightsunami generated by the collapse of the center of the island, creating theimmense caldera that is nearly all that remains of the legendary island we knowas Atlantis. Excavations conducted in eastern Crete in 2006 by Greek-born UCLAEarth scientist Costas Synolakis found chaotic debris from the tsunami as highas 90 feet above sea level.image [../images/f0055-01.jpg]Fig. 12: Impact of the Theran tsunami in 1628 BCE. Map by the author.The controversy begun by Plato 2,350 years ago continues unabated to the presentday. Various modern writers have argued compellingly for the location ofAtlantis in Bolivia (Jim Allen), Argentina (Doug Fisher), the Bahamas (EdgarCayce), Mexico (Gene D. Matlock), Ireland (Ulf Erlingsson), Greenland (MarioDantas), Spain (Georgeos Diaz-Montexano), Morocco (Michael Huebner), Cyprus(Robert Sarmast), Thera (A.G. Galinopoulos), or Antarctica (Rose and RandFlem-Ath). Because some of these areas were, in fact, inundated at the end ofthe Ice Age, it may be that all locations are valid, and that the originallegend of the lost Atlantis is based upon memories of a global maritimecivilization whose coastal communities were drowned beneath the waves when sealevels rose 400 feet worldwide. As our current global climate change continueswarming the seas and melting the remaining ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica,some projections estimate that the global sea levels will rise as much as 18feet by the end of the 21st century, and rise another 200 feet by the year 3000.How many of our current coastal communities will become the next Atlantis?NOTES:1. I put “Minoan” in quotes here because it is an erroneous designation for thatera of Cretan history. We don’t know what the Bronze Age inhabitants calledtheir island. Egyptians called it “Kheftiu,” which is our best approximation.Arthur Evans thought he was excavating the palace of King Minos from the legendof Theseus and the Minotaur, so he called the site “Knossos” and named the era“Minoan.” But in fact, the destruction of Bronze Age Crete (and Knossos)occurred in 1628 BCE, while the legend of Minos, Theseus, and so on actuallyderives from a much later period, the Mycenaean, during the 13th century BCE,after the Achaeans had already moved in from Greece and taken over the place.And Knossos wasn’t a palace at all—it was a mortuary, necropolis, and templecomplex. No signs of habitation (middens, hearths, kitchens, furnishings, eatingand drinking implements, and so on) have ever been found there. But the truemystery of Crete would be another whole chapter in a book of history’smysteries!RESOURCES AND REFERENCESAllen, J.M. Atlantis: The Andes Solution.

GilbertWho when standing before the pyramids of Giza or the lonely megaliths ofStonehenge has not wondered whether the ancients who built them possessedknowledge that we have since lost? The feeling that such monuments must havebeen built for a lofty purpose is overwhelming. For many, the quest to discovertheir meaning and purpose can become a lifelong passion. Without a guidingtextbook from the past or detailed construction plans to tell us unequivocallywhy they were built, we can only produce theories of our own retroactively. Thisis, of course, the scientific approach; it is what archaeologists do all thetime. However, even with the best of intentions, we are often hampered by thesimple fact that we do not share or understand the worldviews of the people whobuilt these monuments. Unfortunately, because archaeology is an inexact science,and because those who exert the most influence within the discipline do not wantto look like fools, there is a tendency to simplify what were probably complexmotives on the part of the ancients.This can lead to naive assumptions, such as that the Great Pyramid of Giza isnothing more than the elaborate tombstone of a megalomaniac pharaoh. At firstsight it is difficult to argue with this supposition, especially when we realisethat pyramids nearly always contain sarcophagi. However we would not describe achurch as a mausoleum just because it contained burials. Although some peoplechoose to be buried inside a church, most church buildings have a greaterfunction than merely to act as a burial chamber.In order to discover the true meaning and purpose of an ancient monument, oneneeds tools. One of these tools is metrology, the study of measurements. Closeexamination reveals that important monuments are nearly always laid outaccording to some sort of geometrical scheme. By making careful measurements ofa monument and its surroundings, it is often possible to discover the units ofmeasurement that were used by its builders. This in itself can be helpful, forknowledge of the units used can often tell us when and by whom it was built.Another tool, and one that can be used to great effect, is astronomy. It is thistool that primarily concerns us here. In 1969 an extraordinary book waspublished titled Hamlet’s Mill. This was not, as the title might suggest, acritique of Shakespeare’s play Hamlet (although it was the jumping-off point),but rather an investigation into ancient astronomy. What was of interest to theauthors, Professors Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (hereafterreferred to as “the authors”), was the connection between the traditional storyof Hamlet and ancient myths relating to the stars. The Hamlet story itselfderives from the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus, a German author who livedduring the 12th and 13th centuries. It seems that Shakespeare had access to thissource. However, the authors discovered that the Hamlet story is not original tothe Gesta; rather, it derives from an earlier, Icelandic saga which hasparallels with certain stories in the Finnish classic the Kalevala. In theIcelandic version of the saga, the main character’s name is Amlodhi, and hisadventures are part of a larger cycle. His “mill” (which is not mentioned byShakespeare) is a mythological machine of gigantic proportions that is used forgrinding various substances. First it grinds gold and later salt, but then it isaccidentally broken and falls into the sea. Here it continues to grind, turningrocks into sand and making the sea salty. The authors saw in this myth acosmological meaning. They believed that the turning of Hamlet’s (Amlodhi’s)mill was a symbol for a cosmological process: a sequence of “world-ages”determined by the day of the equinox shifting backward, over time, through thezodiac. At the end of each age there would then be some sort of cataclysm, asthe heavens would apparently become “dislocated” from their position at thestart of the age.1 [ch03.html#ch03not1]The authors eventually found that myths from all over the world told a similarstory. They realized that these myths, fragmentary as they were, must have acommon source, and that this common source would need to be very old, indeed.For them, Hamlet’s mill was a metaphor for the heavenly machine that appears toturn around the earth. The axis—or spindle—of this mill runs from pole to pole.Presently the North Pole is located close to Polaris, the north star, but theauthors also recognized that there is another, equally important axis linkingthe poles of the ecliptic, and that it too needed to be considered.The ecliptic is the name given by astronomers to the imaginary circle or pathwayfollowed by the sun as it appears to move through the zodiac at a rate ofroughly one degree per day. In reality, of course, it is the earth that movesaround the sun, so that what we term the axis of the ecliptic is really the axisof the earth’s orbit around the sun.2 [ch03.html#ch03not2] Were the earthoriented in an upright position relative to its orbit, the pole of the eclipticwould be the same as the North Pole. However, because the earth is tipped over(at an angle of roughly 23.5 degrees) from the vertical, this is not the case.In fact, the pole of the ecliptic is situated within the constellation of Draco.Furthermore, because the earth has a slight wobble to its rotation—rather like aspinning top that is running down—the actual position of the north celestialpole is not constant. In fact it moves in a circle around the pole of theecliptic (which is constant), taking roughly 26,000 years to make a fullrevolution. The “latitude” of this circle relative to the North Pole of theecliptic is roughly 23.5 degrees south of it. This wobbling displacement causesthe phenomenon we call the precession of the equinoxes (see Figure 1[ch03.html#ch03fig1]). We will return to this subject in more detail later.image [../images/f0064-01.jpg]Figure 1. The orbiting of the North Pole, over time, around the pole of theecliptic. From The Mitchell Beazley Concise Atlas of the Universe by PatrickMoore. London: Mitchell Beazley Ltd., 1970, p. 141.Hamlet’s Mill is not an easy book to read. However, when I first came across itin 1975, it was a revelation. Here I found proof for something that I hadalready known intuitively for yearse. Astrology—and I use this term in itsoriginal sense as the scientific, comprehensive study of the stars, rather thanfortune telling—is much older than is generally thought. The idea that manyancient myths are based upon astronomical or astrological realities is obviousto anyone who makes a serious study of these matters. For example, the Greekmyths about the 12 labors of Hercules can be understood as metaphors for theannual movement of the sun through the 12 signs of the zodiac. Hercules slayingthe Nemean Lion refers to the movement of the sun through the constellation ofLeo; and obtaining the girdle of the Amazonian queen is most likely a referenceto the sun passing through the constellation of Virgo. We also know from theGreek authors that most of their classic constellations derived their names andidentities from mythology. One has only to think of the story of Perseus andAndromeda who, along with her parents, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia, andthe dragon (Draco), which threatened to eat her, are now constellations of thenorthern sky. The real importance of Hamlet’s Mill, however, is that the authorsbrought a welcome scientific rigour to the study of astronomy in myths.Extracting deeper meanings from these myths was not always easy, as they were towrite in their concluding chapter:It is now known that astrology has provided man with his continuing linguafranca through the centuries. But it is essential to recognize that, in thebeginning, astrology presupposed an astronomy. Through the interplay of thesetwo heavenly concepts, the common elements of free literate knowledge werecaught up in a bizarre bestiary, whose taxonomy [principles of classification]has disappeared. With the remnants of the system scattered all over the world,abandoned to the drift of cultures and languages, it is immensely difficult toidentify the original themes that have undergone so many sea-changes.3[ch03.html#ch03not3]It was with such thoughts in mind that in 1984, I set about writing my firstbook, The Cosmic Wisdom Beyond Astrology. The purpose of this book was toexplore astrology from four perspectives: scientific, artistic, philosophical,and religious. These perspectives represent the fourfold division of man’sbeing, which can be thought of as body, soul, mind, and spirit, all symbolicallylinked to the four elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, respectively. Ipurposely used this approach in order to build bridges between the outlooks offour discrete groups of people: the first type being those who relate to theworld primarily through the body; the second, through the emotions; the third,through the mind; and the fourth, through intuition. I also made use of thecommon language of astrology. This lingua franca was used extensively during theMiddle Ages and even the Renaissance when discussing matters having to do withalchemy, medicine, prognostication, and the occult sciences. Yet the scope of myown book was still limited, for I had not then a sufficient knowledge of eitherastronomy or ancient religions and mythologies to see the important connectionsbetween astronomy, astrology, and prophecy.In 1992, I made the acquaintance of Robert Bauval, a Belgian engineer who wasborn in Egypt and had spent many years investigating the pyramids of Giza fromthe perspective of astronomy. Bauval had a thesis which at its core was verysimple: the great pyramids of Giza represent the belt-stars of Orion. Though hehad originally arrived at this theory intuitively, he backed it up withextremely detailed research covering both Egyptian ideas relating to theastronomy of the constellation of Orion, the orientation of shafts in the GreatPyramid toward certain stars, and the sacred literature the Egyptians inscribedon the walls of some of their pyramids, the so-called Pyramid Texts. We knowfrom their sacred texts that the ancient Egyptians regarded the constellation ofOrion as being the star-form of their favorite god, Osiris. They also believedthat after death, the souls of their pharaohs (and perhaps their own, as well)would travel to these very stars. Here they would be united with Osiris,formerly a king of Egypt but now the ruler of the kingdom of the dead. Thepyramids of Giza, it seemed, were intended to aid this post-mortem ascent to thestars. All this evidence proved beyond all reasonable doubt—in my opinion, atleast—that not only did the pyramids on the ground resemble a three-dimensionalrepresentation of Orion’s Belt, but that this resemblance was no accident.4[ch03.html#ch03not4]I was extremely impressed with Bauval’s work and agreed to write a book withhim, The Orion Mystery. This book contains a lot more than a simple rendition ofBauval’s original theories concerning the pyramids and Orion. It also discussesthe possibility that the pyramids embodied wisdom far more ancient than eventhat of Old Kingdom Egypt. In particular, the structures (or rather, thealignments directed through them) seem to mark the passage of a long age. Inaddition to the three great pyramids, the Giza complex also features two sets ofthree smaller, satellite pyramids. Although these are often referred to as thepyramids of the queens, there is actually no reason for believing that anyqueens were ever buried in them. In fact, Robin Cook (who drew the illustrationsin the book) made an important discovery. He found that both sets of satellitepyramids were spatially related to the central pyramid of Khafre, rather thanthe pyramids they stand next to, Khufu and Menkaure. Parallel lines from theKhafre pyramid, all at 30 degrees to the meridian, which could be drawn fromsignificant locations on the Khafre pyramid, would pass through the centers ofeach of the Menkaure satellite pyramids, while similar lines, at 26.5 degreesfrom the east-west axis, could be drawn through the Khufu satellites.What was so interesting about this was that the first set pointed toward thesetting point of the Belt of Orion—not when the pyramids were built (c. 2500BC), but much earlier, around 10500 BC. This date is significant because at thattime, the Belt stars were at their lowest point in a cycle of movement caused bythe precession of the equinoxes—the same apparent cyclical movement of the skythat causes the celestial pole to move in a circle around the pole of theecliptic. Since then, the apparent movement of the Belt stars makes it look asthough they are drifting northward; today, they stand just below the celestialequator, which means they rise in the east, directly in front of the GreatSphinx.Now, remember that the authors’ contention is that the rotation of Amlodhi’squern (or Hamlet’s mill) is really a metaphor for the cyclical motion of the skyas it appears to rotate around the earth’s pole. However, as we have seen,because of the precessional cycle, this pole itself moves—very slowly, it’strue—in a circle around the pole of the ecliptic. This is the reason why themill is broken in the story: its spindle jumps out from the millstone. Accordingto Norse myth, this millstone fell to the bottom of the sea, while the hole inits middle formed a drain through which the waters of the sea above were drawninto a whirlpool. It was this image of water spiralling down a hole, the authorssaid, that gave rise to another myth, that of the maelstrom, the greatmythological funnel of water or whirlpool which mariners and map-makers havetraditionally placed firmly in the Norwegian Sea. The legendary maelstrom isclearly marked on a map of Scandinavia drawn by Fr. Athanasius Kircher, the lateRenaissance Jesuit priest and polymath (see Figure 2 [ch03.html#ch03fig2]). Inhis map, Kircher shows an imaginary, underground stream that apparently takeswater from the North Sea, via the maelstrom drain, and channels it to thenorthern Baltic. Though no such channel exists in actuality, its pathway on themap more or less follows the Arctic Circle. This, as we shall see, is indeedimportant if we are to fully understand the myth of the maelstrom and itsconnection to Hamlet’s mill.image [../images/f0068-01.jpg]Figure 2. Kircher’s picture showing the maelstrom. From Mundus Subterraneus byA. Kircher, 3rd Ed., 1678.The earth’s wobbling motion has other effects that are not confined to thenorthern latitudes. One of these is the so-called precession of the equinoxes.Put simply, what this means is that the degree on the ecliptic that the sunoccupies on the first day of spring changes over time. In fact it moves backward(precesses) along the ecliptic at a rate of roughly 1 degree every 72 years. Ifwe think of each sign of the zodiac as containing 30 degrees (one-twelfth of afull circle of 360 degrees), this means it takes approximately 2,160 years totraverse one sign. Currently, the spring equinox is moving out of the sign ofPisces and into Aquarius (hence the popular song from the 1960s).There is another way of studying the precessional cycle that is actually moreaccurate than looking at the stars of the zodiac. Our sun is but one star in thegalaxy we call the Milky Way. Although we know intuitively that this is atypical spiral galaxy, like so many others we can see with our telescopes,because our solar system is contained within it, we don’t see it this way. Whatwe do see is a great circle of stars that seemingly rises and falls, first onearc and then the other, as the earth rotates through its 24-hour cycle. We seeour galaxy “edge-on,” as a flattened disk, but it actually has a median planewith half its stars on one side and the rest on the other. Thus the galactic,median plane is like an equator. Because this “equator” is basically a greatcircle in the sky, there are two places where it is crossed by that other greatcircle, the ecliptic. The authors’ research revealed that this fact was known tothe ancients; in fact, they believed that these two crossing points in thesky—one in the northern hemisphere, at the cusp of Gemini and Taurus, and one inthe southern hemisphere, at the cusp of Sagittarius and Scorpio—were gatewaysthrough which souls came into and out of our world. One crossing point was agate of entry, and the other, a gate of exit. Macrobius, in his Commentary onthe Dream of Scipio (late 4th century AD), though he misidentifies the exactpositions where the galactic plane crosses the ecliptic, describes the processof the soul’s descent in some detail:The Milky Way girdles the zodiac, its great circle meeting it obliquely so thatit crosses at the two tropical signs, Capricorn and Cancer.5[ch03.html#ch03not5] Natural philosophers named these the “portals of the sun”because the solstices lie athwart the sun’s path on either side, checkingfarther progress and causing it to retrace its course across the belt beyond.Souls are believed to pass through these portals when going from the sky to theearth and returning from the earth to the sky.6 [ch03.html#ch03not6]Because of the precessional cycle, the place occupied by the summer solstice sunhas been sliding back through the zodiac, just as the vernal and autumnalequinoxes have. Today the summer solstice takes place with the sun locatedexactly at the “portal” where the ecliptic crosses over the plane of the MilkyWay, directly above the up-stretched hand or club of Orion. Conversely, thewinter solstice occurs with the sun positioned at the other portal, the one inSagittarius. Interestingly, these portals were not in alignment with thesolstices during the time of Macrobius, nor indeed have they been at any othertime during the past 13,000 years or so. It seems that, astronomically speakingand in relation to the precessional cycle, we are living at a major turningpoint.Now, this is very interesting because it takes us across the Atlantic to theMaya and their Long Count Calendar. As many people are now aware, this calendarruns out7 [ch03.html#ch03not7] at midnight on December 21, 2012. If it is merelya coincidence that the Maya timed their calendar to end with the sun placed atthe southern portal on the winter solstice, then it is a very remarkablecoincidence, indeed. What seems more likely, especially given their knowledgeand indeed obsession with astronomical time cycles, is that this was deliberate.The Maya somehow knew (though we don’t know how) that the precessional cyclewould reach a turning point on that precise day.I have written two books on the subject of the Mayan prophecy for the end of theage, and always I am asked the same question: Where do you plan to be onDecember 21, 2012 (a day which, as of this writing, is less than two yearsaway)? Usually the question behind this question is Where, assuming this is theend of the world as we know it, do you think it will be safest? Of course Icannot answer this question with any certainty. One might go to a geologicallyinactive location yet still have the misfortune of being killed by a fallingmeteorite. So I would therefore rephrase this question from “Where to go to besafe?” to “Where to go that would be a place of significance?”One possible answer would be Aswan in southern Egypt. Because this town lies on(or very close to) the tropic of Cancer, the sun passes directly overhead atnoon on the summer solstice. Conversely, at midnight on the winter solstice, thesun will pass directly below one’s feet. As it will then be situated at thesouthern “portal,” or crossing point of the ecliptic and median plane of theMilky Way, and as this lies very close to the galaxy’s center, there will be analignment of the earth, sun, and galactic center taking place directlyunderfoot. That event, I think, could be interesting.There is another latitude in the northern hemisphere that might be worthvisiting for the duration of the solstice event. This is the location of thefabled maelstrom somewhere off the coast of northern Norway. To determineexactly where this is, we need to use a little intuition and also make certainassumptions. From Hamlet’s Mill we already know that the maelstrom, or“millstream,” is a coded reference to the pole of the ecliptic. This pole islocated in the constellation of Draco, with celestial declination 66 degrees,33’, 38.55”. Just as the summer solstice sun passes directly overhead at certainpoints, such as Aswan, that lie on the Tropic of Cancer, so every other point inthe sky has a corresponding latitude on earth over which it passes at thezenith. For example, the star Vega (+38 degrees, 47’, 01”), the brightest in thenorthern hemisphere, culminates at the zenith very close to the latitude ofWashington D.C. (38 degrees, 53’ North). By the same reasoning, the pole of theecliptic has as its corresponding latitude 66 degrees, 33’, 38.55” North, which,as it turns out, passes through northern Norway; in fact, it’s actually theArctic Circle. Of course, working out the correct geographical longitude for themythic maelstrom is not so easy. Doing this involves making a few moreassumptions that are not strictly scientific. However, if we assume that in theancient world, the prime meridian (their equivalent of the Greenwich Meridian)ran through the Great Pyramid of Giza, then the -30 degrees meridian (equivalentto shifting westward one sign of the zodiac) would fall about 1 degree 15’ Eastof the Greenwich Meridian. The point on the Arctic Circle with this longitudewould indeed be in the Norwegian Sea, north of eastern England.From an esoteric perspective this has some interesting ramifications. If onewere positioned on this point on the Arctic Circle at exactly midday, localtime, on December 21, 2012, the pole of the ecliptic would be positioneddirectly overhead, with the 12 signs of the zodiac distributed in a circlearound the horizon. Directly in the south the sun would appear on the horizon,aligned with the Sagittarius portal; directly in the north, again on thehorizon, would be the Gemini portal; and linking the two (though possiblyinvisible because of the rising sun) would be the great, star-strewn path wecall the Milky Way, like a bridge between the two portals (see diagram 5). Theancients called the Milky Way “the Way of the Dead,” the road on which soulstravelled between lives, from one gate to the other, in preparation for rebirth.image [../images/f0072-01.jpg]Figure 3. Noon on the arctic circle, winter solstice, 2012. Copyright AdrianGilbert, 2011.It would appear, therefore, that our Norse ancestors, like the Maya priests ofCentral America, were somehow aware of the significance of the positioning ofthe Milky Way/ecliptic portals in the measurement of time. When we consider thetableau before us on the date that the Maya Long Count Calendar comes to the endof the present age, the significance of the maelstrom as a measure of time alsobecomes clear. Standing on the deck of a boat, we would have an image spreadaround the horizon surrounding the maelstrom that is reminiscent of the 12-gatedcity of New Jerusalem that is described at the end of the Bible. For lookinground from this point, we would see the 12 signs of the zodiac—the gates of NewJerusalem—distributed around the horizon, and directly above, the mast, or tree,of the “boat” on which we would have to stand—the pole of the ecliptic. It wouldbe a magical sight, and I think I would rather like to be there to witness it.Provided the sky was clear of clouds and the sea was calm, observing thestar-strewn path from that vantage point and on that auspicious date would makefor a most interesting experience.NOTES1 [ch03.html#ch03not1a].

By the end of the 11th century, theend of the Viking Age, their longships had reached as far west as Iceland andGreenland, as far south as Northern Africa, and as far east as the Volga Riverand Constantinople. The Viking Age was not remembered for their exploration ofthe world, however, but for their brutal conquest of Northern Europe. InEngland, the Vikings arrived in AD 773, when their serpentine boats were firstseen off the coast of Sussex. In AD 787, three Viking ships docked atDorchester. When the harbor master tried to find out who these visitors were, heand his assistants were swiftly killed. But the fear of the Vikings truly tookroot on June 16, 793, when they landed at the tidal island of Lindisfarne,roughly on the border between Scotland and England. Lindisfarne was a center forlearning that was famous across the Christian world, but the Vikings turned itinto a scene of devastation: the monks were killed, thrown into the sea todrown, or carried away as slaves. Throughout the 9th century, the Vikings wouldattack and slowly take control of the British Isles, as well as many othercountries in Europe, including France, where they reached Paris by AD 845. Bythe year 900, major towns and abbeys across the continent had been sacked.Vanquished countries would never be the same again, and distant memories of theViking raids continue to live on in memory and popular legends to this day.What caused the Vikings to invade so many European countries remains a mystery,though historians have speculated wildly on the subject. Early theories focusedon overpopulation and the need to expand the Viking territory. This proposal hasnow been abandoned, but there is still no consensus as to why the Vikingsinvaded Europe. Missing from the gamut of possibilities is that they might havegone in search of their mythical homeland, Walhalla, which, according to theirlegends, was somewhere to the southwest. Walhalla is traditionally described asa hall, but in myth it was inextricably linked with an island, where the godshad supposedly granted its inhabitants the gift of immortality. That the Vikingshad indeed left their homeland in search of Walhalla was the conclusion reachedby the Belgian historian Marcel Mestdagh. After years of retelling the sametraditional story of the Viking conquest of Europe to his students, he realizedthat there was a method to the Viking madness, in that they first invadedEngland and then France. Mestdagh had noticed something that no one had seenbefore.After their initial conquests, mostly of islands and coastal regions, theVikings gathered their so-called Great Army. In England, the Great Army wasformed in 866, the core of it created by soldiers brought by boat from Denmark.Their mission was to conquer the major towns and cities, a task that was finallyaccomplished in 879 when the army crossed the Channel to continue their campaignin France. Mestdagh realized that the way in which the Great Army moved aboutthrough England was not haphazard, but rather followed a pattern. It was almostas though something in the landscape—something in the topography, perhaps—wasleading them from place to place. Whatever it was, it was something that wasstill present or visible at that time but has long since been lost to us.Many years and a great deal of research later, Mestdagh realized that thismissing clue was still present in the landscape, though we no longer recognizedit as such: it was an ancient road network that fanned out from two towns, onein England (Nottingham) and one in France (Sens). Mestdagh was able to show thatthe network of roads in England centered on Nottingham, but that the Vikingshadn’t been able to find there what they were looking for. After the conquest ofNottingham, new recruits came from Denmark, and the Viking Army crossed theChannel into France. There they made use of the same system of roads, wherebyall roads led to the French city of Sens, which the Viking Great Army reached inlate 886.Interestingly, Sens was the only city that the Vikings did not sack. Instead, itwas taken after a peaceful siege, which lasted only about six months. Thehistory books make special note of the fact that no one was injured or killedduring the siege of Sens. When the Great Army arrived, the people of the townhad settled on the islands in the river Yonne, fully expecting that they wouldbe brutally invaded like any other town. Some historians have argued that thearchbishop of Sens had bought peace with the Vikings, but there is no evidenceto support this. In short, there is no known reason why the Vikings would havesuddenly changed their MO. But, Mestdagh wondered, was Sens, the formerstronghold of the Celtic tribe known as the Senones (“elders”), somehow sacredto the Vikings? Was Sens what the Vikings had been looking for and had nowfound? Could it be that Sens was their mythical Walhalla? Was this why they didnot sack the town?The Vikings were not alone in having a myth of a lost island. The Celts calledit Avalon; for the Portuguese, it was Antilia. Indeed, most people in medievalEurope had heard of an island called Ys, which was sometimes linked with theIrish monk and navigator Saint Brendan or with the lost land of Lyonnesse,itself thought to be located off the western coastline of Cornwall. But for theGreeks, it was the lost island of Atlantis, which they had heard about when theyvisited the Egyptian temples. The multitude of names was due to the fact thatthe island was originally known merely as “the Island”—everyone knew what wasbeing referred to. Some, like the Goths, focused on the shape of the island whengiving it its name (Oium, “the egg”). Although some will rightly argue that Sensis not an island, the surrounding region was and continues to be known asÎle-de-France—the island of France. Is it any real surprise that the origin of aname used every day by millions of people remains a total mystery to historians?What the Vikings encountered in northern France was an old and long-forgottensystem of roads. Mestdagh believed the road network had originally been the workof the Romans, who were known to have been road builders par excellence. Thenotorious Roman conqueror Julius Caesar had chosen Agedincum—Sens—as the townwhere he stationed his armies, though it became only an administrative center inthe late 4th century AD. It soon became clear, however, that the Romans had notconstructed this network of road, as they were interlaced with a network ofmegalithic stones and therefore dated back thousands of years earlier, longbefore the Romans ever invaded Gaul. Standing stones and other megalithicconstructions are known to have been used as boundary markers by the Celts, apeople that came from the Eastern parts of Europe in the first millennium BC. Itis well known that the Celts made active use of these megalithic sites, and whenplaces like Stonehenge were analyzed in the 18th century by the likes of WilliamStukeley, it was thought that the priestly class known as the druids performedelaborate ceremonies inside and amongst these monuments. But Caesar in hisconquest of Gaul specifically targeted and hunted down the druids, thus ensuringthat nothing of their knowledge survived.No such extermination had occurred in the Scandinavian countries, which wereequally rich in megalithic sites. In fact, Northern Europe had a relativelypeaceful transition from megalithic times all the way to the Vikings. This meantthat the knowledge associated with these megaliths survived well into the era ofthe Vikings, which meant that when they landed in Europe they knew far moreabout these ancient markers than the local people did. The Vikings hadeffectively maintained an active link to a former world, and by AD 800, whenthey set out to find their Walhalla, they managed to do so largely on the basisof this link, which, sadly, had been severed, first by the Romans and later byChristianity in England and France. As a consequence, very little of the Vikingknowledge was passed down to us, so Mestdagh had to spend years driving throughthe countryside of northern France, mapping megaliths, road networks, andancient monuments, as well as cataloguing ancient legends—all of this at a time(the 1970s and ‘80s) when there was no GPS or the modern miracle that is GoogleEarth. It was a monumental task that would be a contributing factor to his earlydeath, though not before he could publish the astonishing conclusions hisresearch had revealed to him.When he looked at the results of his painstaking research, he realized that thisnetwork of roads and megaliths was only part of the story. He also discovered aseries of tremendously long ditches, which had at one time formed a series ofvast, concentric ovals with Sens at its center. No one had ever figured out whatthese ovals signified. In fact, the raised sides of the ditches had once beenused to construct roads, many of which survived and are still in use to thisday. But Mestdagh’s on-site investigations showed that enormous ditches had oncebeen located there and that, oftentimes, they could still be descried in thelandscape. Because the ditches were made in sand, their integrity had slowlydegenerated during the more than 3,000 years that they had not been in use.Detailed analysis revealed that they were actually ditches with raised borders.In the center of each was a depression or trough that had probably containedwater at one time. These inner ditches were often connected to rivers andprobably functioned as canals; indeed, portions of the concentric ovals thatsurrounded Sens were comprised of actual rivers—the portion of the river Marnebetween Meaux and Châlons-sur-Marne, for example.The true extent of knowledge that Megalithic peoples—the ones responsible forthe thousands of megaliths in Western Europe—possessed has not yet been plumbedeither by archaeology or history. But in the 1970s, archaeologist Alexander Thommade an amazing discovery. After performing detailed studies of more than 600megaliths in Britain, Ireland, and Brittany, he realized that all of them hadbeen built with a standard unit of measurement, which he called the Megalithicyard. He also concluded that there was a central form of government, “becausethere must have been a headquarters from which standard rods were sent out butwhether this was in these islands or on the Continent the present investigationcannot determine” (Thom 1976). That headquarters may have been Sens.Research carried out by English writer John Michell, as reported in At theCenter of the World: Polar Symbolism Discovered in Celtic, Norse and OtherRitualized Landscapes, demonstrated that someone in pre-Celtic, and henceMegalithic times possessed an extraordinarily detailed knowledge of thegeography of northwestern Europe and had been able to accurately locate thegeographical center of the British Isles. Interestingly, the Vikings were alsoprivy to this knowledge. This is an important discovery, for before Michellreported on these discoveries in 1994, Mestdagh had realized that the sacredcenter at Sens had been created in accordance with the cardinal points, bysomeone with a detailed understanding of geography. The main axis of thisgeometrical pattern ran east-west, and went through the center of the city ofSens, extending to the east, with the center of the road system located about1.5 miles east of the city.The end result of Mestdagh’s investigation was multifold. First, there was atotal of 64 roads extending as far as 200 miles in either direction. He hadfound hundreds of miles of this road network still in use in the 1980s, withnumerous megaliths and sacred sites along the way. Second, Mestdagh alsorealized that many of the names of the towns and villages situated along theseroads contained the Marc- or Merc- prefix: literally, “marker.” One of thebetter known sites is located on the southern road, which skirted thePuy-de-Dôme, a famous extinct volcano, which has commonly been regarded assacred since Celtic times, if not earlier. Its summit holds a temple dedicatedto the Roman god Mercury, a further reference to the merc- prefix. Is it acoincidence that Mercurius was thought to be the protector of travelers on theroad?image [../images/f0080-01.jpg]The system of concentric ditches centered on the city of Sens.This system of four concentric ditches would have required an extraordinaryamount of work to construct, for the circumference of Oval I, the first andsmallest oval, is already an incredible 400 miles. Oval IV has axes of 297 and370 miles, and a circumference of 1,106 miles. Staggering dimensions, butdefinitely still within human capabilities, particularly when we remember thatthe Great Wall of China stretches for more than 5,500 miles.On a map of France, Oval III is almost visible to the naked, untrained eye. Takeany map from France and find the town of Rouen; follow it down to Le Mans,Tours, and Châteauroux. Further north is a small section between Amiens andPoix; between Poix and Rouen there is a section missing on modern maps, but itis known that there was once a Roman road here. Far from being mere figments ofthe imagination, these ovals are very real.When you map the old Celtic tribal boundaries, they coincide with the ovals andthe fanlike road network centered on Sens. When we realize that this Megalithicsystem incorporated standing stones, and that the Celts used these stones asboundary markers, the enigma of why certain standing stones were placed incertain locations is explained. Mestdagh had essentially discovered a Megalithiccivilization, a civilization that had once been lost to the sands of time. Buthad it? There were the clear references to an island, remembered in the nameÎle-de-France, but could this place really have been the mythical lost island ofAtlantis?Fortunately for the trained historian, Mestdagh did not have to take this onfaith. We now know that the story of Atlantis was told to Plato by Solon, whohad visited Egypt and heard about the lost city from local temple priests. Theyhad provided Solon with precise dimensions—3,000 stadia (333 miles)—of thisisland, which Plato then incorporated in his account, part of an unfinished workknown to us as Timaeus. And here is where it gets interesting: Oval IV can beinscribed inside a diamond (as any oval can) comprised of equal sides that are333 miles long. This distance corresponds perfectly with the 3,000 stadia thatPlato mentioned as the dimensions of Atlantis. But there is more. Plato locatesAtlantis on relatively flat land, and situates it between the mountains and thesea. Oval IV is indeed located on relatively flat land, and sits betweenmountains (the Alps) and the sea (the Mediterranean). Plato adds that thedistance from Atlantis to the sea is 2,000 stadia, or 222 miles—precisely thedistance from the southernmost point of the diamond to the Mediterraneancoastline. Finally, using the system of roads, Mestdagh was able to retrace the“10 Kingdoms of Atlantis” mentioned by Plato, concluding that the area withinOval I was the “middle kingdom” and that the area between Oval I and Oval IVcontained the nine other kingdoms. Another Greek philosopher, Proclus, referredto a text of Marcellus, which stated that the width of the middle kingdom ofAtlantis was 1,000 stadia, which is actually precisely the width of Oval I! Andcan it be “just” a coincidence that there is a town named Avalon, the name of alost mythical land in Celtic tradition, located on this very oval?Mestdagh also found supporting evidence that the Megalithic civilization wasAtlantis from the megalithic era itself. Petit-Mont is a famous tumulus (a moundof earth and/or stones over a grave or graves) around the Gulf of Morbihan, aregion that is known today mainly for its more than 4,000 standing stones, mostof them aligned into rows in and around the town of Carnac. The tumulus datesback to 4600 BC and is one of the most significant, but also most brutallydamaged, cairns in Brittany. Z. Le Rouzic was one of the first Frencharchaeologists who actively investigated and restored the Megalithic monumentsof Brittany in the first half of the 20th century. Inside the tumulus, Le Rouzicidentified a series of stones that carried inscriptions along the interiorwalls. Stone M is an ellipse with 18 spokes and is traditionally interpreted asa solar wheel. But Mestdagh contended that this was actually a map of Atlantis,showing the nine-plus-one kingdoms of the lost civilization. An analysis of thecarvings around the “solar wheel” added weight to this interpretation, as itshowed mountains to the south, the shores of East Anglia and Kent, and the Rhineand Main river system, thus revealing that the “solar wheel”—Atlantis—wassituated in a location that makes it a perfect geographical fit with Mestdagh’sMegalithic civilization.The lost civilization of Atlantis had been found. It would have taken ourancestors centuries to build this truly gigantic and sophisticated civilization.We know that the Megalithic city was an island surrounded by an astonishingsystem of canals, and the etymology of the word island provides us with perhapsthe best clue as to its shape. For example in Dutch it is eiland, which means“egg land” or “the land in the shape of an egg”—an oval. The English word“island” comes from is-land or ys-land, and it is in Brittany that the story ofthe drowned land of Ys is recorded. In the story, dykes are used to protect theisland from the sea; incredibly, dykes are precisely what Mestdagh found there.It is my belief that Sens was the capital, the sacred spiritual center, ofAtlantis. No doubt this is why its inhabitants were known as the Senones, “theelders,” in Celtic times. Its sacred nature was also apparent during medievaltimes, when its archbishops held the prestigious title of Primate of Gaul andGermany, an extraordinary honor which the history books have had greatdifficulty explaining. The fact that Caesar himself stationed his army in Sensgives further support to the idea that Sens was of great historical importance.Caesar knew that the druids were his most dangerous opponents. He made it hismission to silence and exterminate them, famously giving chase and thencornering them in England on the island of Anglesey. Did Caesar station his armyin Sens because it was their French headquarters?Sens as the center of the Megalithic world might seem odd, given our modernperspective on the history of that area. Today the megaliths in Carnac are farbetter known. This is something for which the tourism industry is partly toblame. An inventory of all extant French megaliths was established in 1880 andprinted in the Bulletin de la Société d’Anthropologie de Paris. The reportclearly shows that by far the largest concentration of megaliths—261 out of 509pockets—can be found in and around Sens. Though most of these disappeared by theturn of the last century, due to the encroachment of civilization and thecontingencies of our modern age, the area around Sens was once literallylittered with megaliths. It was the center of a lost world—Walhalla.Archaeologists tend to see megalithic monuments in total isolation. For example,the gigantic stone circles of Avebury are located mere 12 miles to the north ofStonehenge, which is probably the best-known megalithic monument in the world.But hardly any research has been undertaken by professional archaeologists tofind what common ground, if any, exists between the two structures, even thoughit’s a very straightforward fact that the people of Stonehenge knew of Avebury,and vice versa. Mestdagh’s research methodology showed that we should not lookat megalithic complexes in isolation—as archaeology tends to do—but as acoherent whole. This idea is also in line with the conclusions drawn byAlexander Thom, that the megalithic civilization had headquarters—acapital—somewhere. That capital has now been identified as Sens. What this meansis that from ca. 4500 to 1200 BC, a major civilization existed in Europe ofwhich we know very little.What we now call its inhabitants—the Megalithic peoples—shows that we have givenprimacy to this aspect of their culture, the stone cutting and technology behindit. But Mestdagh’s discovery unveiled several more facets of this civilizationthat was clearly on par with, if not superior to, ancient Egypt. In fact, thisis precisely why Solon was told of this city when he visited Egypt. But whereasthere are thousands books about ancient Egypt, there is hardly any knowledgeabout the Megalithic civilization of Northern Europe. It is missing from thepages of history altogether, and if it had not been for a few Egyptian priests,Solon, and Plato, it might have been lost forever.When Mestdagh focused his research on Stonehenge and Avebury, he found remnantsof an oval road that connected the two sites. The road actually extends beyondthe two sites. When traced on a map, he found that two-thirds of this oval stillexisted and that its dimensions were precisely one-tenth of the dimensions ofOval II in France. With this mathematical information, he had undeniable proofthat the megalith builders of France knew of the megalith builders of England.Everything that happened for more than three millennia in Northern Europe wasexecuted according to a plan so great in design that it defies belief. But thatis precisely what the lost civilization of Atlantis was.It is clear that the Ancient Egyptians knew about the lost civilization ofAtlantis. By the time Solon arrived in Egypt, the Megalithic civilization ofAtlantis was a thing of the past. But ancient Egypt was a thriving civilizationwhen the Megalithic civilization flourished, between 3500 and 1200 BC. InEgyptian mythology, the Afterlife was identified as an island in the westintersected by canals, and was represented as an enclosed oval formed by thebody of Nut, surmounted by Osiris holding aloft the Solar Disk. This Egyptianequivalent of Walhalla was known as the Sekhet-hetep, the Field of Offerings.Egyptologists have interpreted these “myths” as the product of the imaginationsof the ancient Egyptians. An alternative interpretation is available, one whichclearly shows that Sekhet-hetep was once real and existed in France.That there was some kind of communication between the Megalithic civilizationand Egypt was once accepted in archaeological circles. The Italiananthropologist Guiseppe Sergi recorded finding the sign of the ankh and otherhieroglyphic signs on several French dolmens. Professor J. Morris Jonesconfirmed the suggestion of Sir John Rhys that Celtic languages preserved anEgyptian Hamitic syntax: “The pre-Aryan idioms which still live in Welsh andIrish were derived from a language allied to Egyptian and the Berber tongues”(Rolleston, 2006). French archaeologist Letorneau noted in 1893 in the Bulletinde la Société d’Anthropologie that “the builders of our megalithic monumentscame from the South, and were related to the races of North Africa.” In modernarchaeological circles, however, this is a most unpopular opinion; the currentpolitically correct belief is that all cultures developed totally independent ofeach other, eschewing what is now seen as an outdated colonial perspective thatany culture could have been incapable of accomplishing extraordinary feats (suchas building the Great Pyramid) on their own. But when it comes to the Megalithiccivilization of Atlantis, this stance is turned on its head, and archaeologistsargue that there was never any such thing as one monolithic civilization!Mestdagh’s material was only ever made available to a Dutch audience; therefore,follow-up research after his death in 1990 has been limited. Dutch researcherWim Zitman has studied Mestdagh’s conclusions and has noted that the dimensionsof the Atlantean civilization contained a series of numbers that aremathematically related to the star Sirius. Sirius is the brightest star in thesky and is sacred in many cultures, but in none more so than in ancient Egypt.Zitman argues that the ancients worked with the notion that time was equal todistance—a concept that is essentially correct, as we now know that time andspace are identical—and that when one measures the distances between ancientmonuments, one often finds numbers that correspond to certain astronomicalmeasurements. The ancients, he argues, observed the sky and astronomical events,and incorporated them in their earthly constructions to reflect one aspect ofthe famous maxim “As above, so below”—in this case, what was seen in the skieswas reflected on the ground in the sacred layouts of these structures. Zitman,in his book Egypt: Image of Heaven, has demonstrated how this occurred inancient Egypt. But it is clear that for certain astronomical bodies andconstellations to be mapped, not everything could be done from Egypt. It isknown, for example, that ancient Greek scientists traveled as far north as theScottish Outer Hebrides, which was the location of the stone circle ofCallanish. The location of this megalithic structure was no accident, for it wasonly at that northern latitude that certain astronomical events (those relatedto the moon, for example) could be observed.Similarly, although Mestdagh’s discovery of the network of radiating roadsemanating from the center like the spokes of a wheel might have been met withincredulity by the archaeologists, it is actually not the only such system ofroads in existence, nor is it even the oldest at 5,000 years old. In the 1930s,the French amateur archaeologist Xavier Guichard published the results of hislife-long study of the place name Eleusis. There is a city that bears that namein both Greece and Egypt. Of the two, the Greek city is the most famous as thehome of the Eleusian mysteries. In mythology, we also have the Elysian Fields,which are intimately connected to the Afterlife and can be seen as the Greekequivalent of the Norse Walhalla. Guichard published his findings in a bookcalled Eleusis Alesia, a study on the origins of European civilization.Published in 1936, it had a print run of 500 copies, several of which weresubsequently lost. When I had a friend check out the copy from the main libraryin the French city of Lyon in 1997, it had been more than two decades since ithad been consulted! According to Guichard, all places named Alesia (or similar)had been given that name in prehistoric times. Not a single location had been sotitled in more recent times, meaning that these sites must have been named inextremely ancient times. He believed that the name was derived from anIndo-European root meaning “a meeting point to which people traveled.” Themajority of these sites can be found in France, where there were once more than400, while others can be found in Poland and Spain, and as far away as Greeceand Egypt. Interestingly, Guichard was unable to find such place names inBritain, which suggests that these cities dated back to the time of the last IceAge, when Britain was covered with thick sheets of ice and unfit for humanhabitation.Guichard, like Mestdagh, made it a point to visit most of these sites in person.He discovered that they all had two characteristic features in common: they werelocated on a hill overlooking a river, and they were built around a man-madewell of saltwater or mineral water. When he mapped their locations, he realizedthat all the sites lay on lines that radiated, like the spokes of a wheel, fromthe town of Alaise in eastern France. This is an echo of what Mestdaghdiscovered at Sens. Guichard believed that 24 equally spaced, radiating lines,plus four lines aligned to the sunrise/sunset at the two equinoxes and thesummer and winter solstices, linked the various sites. This yielded a total of28 lines, showing, perhaps, a lunar connection, and suggesting that ourancestors were somehow able to map the Earth 12,000 years ago. Of course, it was12,000 years ago that Atlantis sank, at least according to Plato. But all theinformation we’ve gleaned so far suggests that it ended sometime around 1200 BC.So although it is an undeniable fact that the Megalithic civilization of Sensbore the same dimensions and was situated in the same location as Plato’sAtlantis, the timing doesn’t add up. What are we to make of this?For Mestdagh the answer lay in the possibility that the number of years that wasquoted to Solon did not refer to solar years, but lunar years. If this is true,that would yield an end date of ca. 1200 BC, which would conform with theinformation provided to Solon by the Egyptian temple priests. But we cannot besure that this is the correct approach. If we take Plato’s information asgospel, there are several possibilities: someone was confused and in error aboutthe dates of the Atlantean civilization; two separate legends were somehow madeone, with another lost civilization somewhere to be found that is 12,000 yearsold; or the Megalithic civilization of Sens was not, in fact, the real Atlantis.It is clear that the dimensions of Atlantis are identical to those of theMegalithic civilization at Sens. And unless the various analyses of theMegalithic civilizations are wrong, the megaliths of Northwestern Europe do notdate back to 12,000 years ago. Which leaves one option, which for the momentneeds to be our working hypothesis—namely, that the Megalithic civilization,itself a truly lost civilization, was constructed as a copy, a perfect replica,of another civilization that was once lost itself and which was indeed farolder. In other words, the original Atlantis.Apart from the time frame, everything about this Megalithic civilization fitsinto what we know of Atlantis. The dating of the Megalithic civilization itselfis by proxy—that is, by the material found on and around the various standingstones. It is my belief that there may have been two discrete phases: theoriginal construction, which occurred about 12,000 years ago, and what was addedon later, around 4000 BC and onward, when people came and repaired thestructures, essentially re-creating the lost Atlantis. Of course this is ahypothesis that is currently impossible to validate, but quite often that onlymeans that the truth is out there, just waiting to be discovered.BIBLIOGRAPHYRolleston, Thomas William. Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race. West ValleyCity, Utah: Waking Lion Press, 2006.Thom, Alexander. Megalithic Sites in Britain. Oxford, UK: Oxford UniversityPress, 1976."},{"pageContent":"TEMPLES, CREATOR-GODS, AND THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE SOULBy Freddy SilvaThe Earth is populated with persistent legends of men of great intellectual andphysical stature and renown who were responsible for constructing places ofpower—sacred sites, temples, and cities of knowledge. These legends still swirlaround such sites as Giza, Tiwanaku, Easter Island, and Teotihuacan like amagnetic mist.In Egypt, the so-called Building Texts (written on the walls of the temple ofEdfu) offer us a clue to the motivations of these ancient architects. Therecords state that after founding the first primeval mound—and later theAcademy—at Heliopolis, groups of builder-gods set about locating other mounds atcarefully chosen locations that would act as foundations for future temples, thedevelopment of which was intended to bring about “the resurrection of the formerworld of the gods,” which had been destroyed long ago by a worldwide flood. Theyfurther state that these builder-gods, the Ahau (meaning “gods who stand up”),were survivors from an island that had been overwhelmed by a catastrophe thathad “inundated [their] former mansions.”The texts place these builder-gods in remote, possibly Palaeolithic times,because the era of dynastic kings supposedly began around 3100 BC with thePharaoh Menes, who was considered by the ancient Egyptians to be the first humanruler—that is, a descendent of a purely human bloodline. This era was precededby the dominion of the Akhu Shemsu Hor (“shining ones, followers of Horus”),builder-gods whose lineage was of divine descent. And even earlier in Egyptianpre-history, the texts mention the “Occasion of the First Time,” when the landwas ruled by the Neteru (“creator-gods”), whose era was brought to a close bythe catastrophic global deluge. The advice given to initiates at the temple ofEdfu, which we can also read in these texts, offers us a glimpse into what thesesupernatural builder-gods may have looked like: initiates were instructed to“stand up with the Ahau,” who measured 9 cubits tall. That’s approximately 15feet tall!EASTER ISLANDStrange as it may seem, these builder-gods reappear much later, during the 18thcentury, this time on an island in the Pacific ocean. The first Europeanexplorer to reach the island of Te Pito o Te Henua (“navel of the world”) in thePacific Ocean was Jacob Roggeveen, who did so in 1722 on Easter Sunday, henceits anglicized name. While stationed there, he faithfully catalogued theislanders’ traditions and beliefs, one of which was that their populationconsisted of two discrete races—the “Short Ears” and the “Long Ears.” The term“Short Ears” referred to typical Homo sapiens. As for the Long Ears, Roggeveenand his crew claimed they had direct interaction with these giants: “In truth, Imight say that these savages are as tall and broad in proportion, averaging 12feet in height. Surprising as it may appear, the tallest men on board our shipcould pass between the legs of these children of Goliath without bending theirhead[s].” The islanders believed that the Long Ears’ ancestors were magicianbuilder-gods called Ma’ori-Ko-Hau-Rongorongo (“masters of special knowledge”),who they believed were responsible for raising the carved stone effigies—theenigmatic moai (“images”) that punctuate the topography of Easter Island andwhose monolithic faces stare longingly at the sky. According to oral tradition,these “masters” moved the colossi with the use of mana, a kind of psychic forcewhereby matter yields to the focused intent of a person skilled in the subtlearts. The natives believed that by the “words of [the gods’] mouths” the statueswere commanded to move through the air. Were these divine ancestors of the LongEars, these master builders, the very same builder-gods mentioned in the ancientEgyptian wall writings? Amazingly, nearly identical mythological narratives cameout of Tiwanaku in Bolivia and the Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal, both ofwhich describe temples being created by stones levitated by trumpets, sound, orspecial vocal commands.FLOODS: MYTHOLOGICAL AND HISTORICALThere are 175 global flood myths that share nearly identical narratives. Many ifnot most of these come from cultures that supposedly had no contact with oneanother. Alexander Tollman, an Austrian professor of geology, compared severalflood myths that describe the earth being hit by “seven burning suns” beforebeing overwhelmed by floods. He then compared these myths with actual geologicalanomalies resulting from the molten rock thrown up at meteor impact sites, andconclusively proved that around 10000 BC, the earth was indeed hit by sevenmeteor fragments, whose impact generated an increase in radioactive carbon-14,which has been found in fossilized trees dating from that period. Likewise, in2008 a team of Danish geologists conducted an extensive examination of ice coresin Greenland and settled on a precise date of the catastrophic event of 9703BC—barely 100 years later than the date in Plato’s well-known account ofAtlantis. Startled by the layer of soot in the ice, they remarked that “theclimate shift was so sudden that it is as if a button [had been] pressed.”And yet, despite the catastrophe, the ancestral wisdom survived. This knowledgeand other important records from men of high learning not only survived theinitial catastrophe and ensuing flood but were promulgated by groups of adeptsvariously called the Seven Sages, the builder-gods, or the Followers of Horus.In the Edfu texts, for example, they were the only divine beings who knew howtemples and sacred places of power could be created. In another example, thePuranas of the Tamil of southern India mention how Seven Sages visited thesacred hill of Arunachala after the flood to collect knowledge and embark onreconstructing the area between the Indus and the Ganges. And in Andeantraditions, the megalithic monument builders are called the Huari, a race ofwhite-skinned, bearded giants, the most celebrated of which was a builder-godnamed Viracocha. Together with seven “shining ones,” he set about building thetemple complex of Tiwanaku, from whence they set out to promulgate theirknowledge throughout the Andes. It is through the efforts of these adepts thatwe have inherited a legacy of temples and places of veneration all over theglobe.And what a legacy it is. For despite thousands of years of war, the encroachmentof modern civilization, and the often suspicious if not downright hostile stanceof organized religion regarding many of these structures, tens of thousands ofsacred sites still stand in just about every country on Earth. Perhaps notsurprisingly, many of these sites share certain features in common. For example,many were built using colossal stones, often hauled from hundreds of miles away;many were aligned to the heliacal rising of specific stars and mirror entireconstellations; and many of them compute with monotonous regularity the solarand lunar calendars, solstices, and equinoxes. And let’s not forget theHerculean effort that was required to build them, seemingly for the mereobservation of the heavens. Given all of this, we are forced to consider thepossibility that these temples were likely built with another purpose in mind,for it is clear that they were built to last for all eternity, and certainly atleast into an age when humanity would inevitably lose its connection with thedivine (today, perhaps?). It should then come as no surprise that these templeswere not only re-creations of the former world(s) of the gods, but also placeswhere the individual could be transformed into a god. In other words, theirpurpose was nothing less than the complete self-realization of the individualthrough the transfiguration of the soul.THE MYSTERY OF THE THREE STEPPINGS OF VISHNUTo get an idea of the scale of “spiritual engineering” that these builder-godsemployed to achieve their goals, consider the most rudimentary of sacred sites,the holy mountain. In virtually every holy mountain the world over, the exactplace of veneration is located in a spot where the geomagnetic field is morepronounced. Such “landscape temples” are often also accessed by a “spirit road,”what the scientist calls a telluric current. These currents are essentiallyelectromagnetic pathways that flow across the face of the earth. During thecourse of my research into the way sacred sites are connected to one anotherthrough common narratives, myths, and folklore, I also discovered that they allseem to share an uncannily accurate geometry, specifically triangles. Thetriangle is, of course, the geometric representation of the three-fold nature ofthe Biblical God, the Holy Trinity. This same idea is also found in Hinducosmology, in which the god Shiva appears intertwined with the gods Vishnu andBrahma, all three representing the concept of Trimurti, the three-fold nature ofthe one divine creative aspect that regulates creation, maintenance, anddestruction. Vishnu, whose role it is to protect humans and restore order to theworld, is often described in the narrative of the Rig Veda as taking threesteps:I will declare the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who measured out the earthlyregions…thrice setting down his footstep, widely striding…. He within whosethree wide-extended paces all living creatures have their habitation…. Him whoalone with triple step hath measured this common dwelling place, long farextended….And further along in the text, Vishnu strides “widely pacing, with threesteppings [sic] forth over the realms of the earth for freedom and for life.”Strange behavior indeed for a god. Vishnu is eventually given the attributeTrivikrama, meaning “of the three steps.” Is it possible that Vishnu, thebringer of order to the world, arranged these holy mountains, these landscapetemples, in threes? And are these hills sacred because they are infused with thenuminous quality of a creator-god? (Note that vis-nu actually means “to enter orinfuse” and “all-pervading.”) I decided to test my hypothesis.The Indian subcontinent has many mountains, yet few are sacred, and fewer stillare associated with Shiva/Vishnu. The most renowned of these is Mount Kailas,the earthly equivalent of Mount Meru, which itself represents the allegoricalstructure of the universe as well as the highest spiritual achievement sought byadepts in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jainian cosmologies. Kailas is also the abode ofShiva, a place of “eternal bliss” sacred to five religions. My second contenderwas the holy hill of Gabbar. Like Kailas, in myth it is the origin of thesupreme cosmic power of the universe, and the place where Shiva leaves the heartof his first wife, Sati. The third contender, Maa Sharda, was a conical hillthat has been used as a sacred mountain since the Paleolithic era. In the RegVida, Shiva, mourning over his deceased wife, drops her necklace there. So wehave three sites that are connected, through legend, to Shiva, an inextricableaspect of Vishnu. If you link all three sites on a map, it creates a perfectright triangle to within 1 degree of error. Considering that it measures 1,650miles along the edges, this is an incredible degree of accuracy, especially aswe are dealing with three distinct, naturally occurring features. Vishnuapparently did set down his footsteps three times, “widely striding.”I soon discovered this was by no means a coincidence. Right-angle or isoscelestriangles also connect sacred mountains in China, New Mexico, and Japan(including many of Japan’s oldest and holiest shrines). This is supported by thefact that temples were later erected near these hot spots, also called “navelsof the earth.” In the British Isles, for example, three sites more than 600miles apart, yet sharing similar traditions, functions, and age, are connectedto each other by a perfect equilateral triangle: Avebury in England, Kealkill inIreland, and Murchie Moor in Scotland. Similar sites exist throughout the MiddleEast and in Portugal, as well.Just how far the Followers of Horus and their later incarnations would go tocreate these enormous networks of linked power places is in evidence all aroundthe Mediterranean. For example, there exists a demonstrable link between theoracle of Delphi and the Egyptian temple complex at Karnak. Legend states thatKarnak is the mother of all oracles, from where all other oracles emanate, andthat two doves once flew between Karnak and Delphi; both were dedicated to solargods (Zeus/Apollo in Greece, and Amun/Ra in Egypt); both once contained notableexamples of navel stones; and both were used as places of clairvoyance. It seemsthat in using the oracles, the adepts were tapping into the power of a connectedgrid so as to amplify their abilities. The “hill forts” throughout the BritishIsles were also used for such a purpose. But why did two doves fly betweenKarnak and Delphi, a distance of 1,070 miles (a figure tantalizingly close tothe radius of the moon)? The dove also makes an appearance as a symbol ofcommunication in the story of Noah who, as Ziusudra, is also the central figureof the Sumerian flood myth, as is Manu, the preserver, father of humanity, andinstitutor of religious ceremonies in the Vedic texts. His progeny callthemselves Aryas, meaning “noble,” “pure,” or “enlightened.” In each case,Manu/Ziusudra/Noah is directly instructed by God/the gods to build a boat priorto a flood, and is accompanied in the endeavor by Seven Sages who, after thedeluge, go on to teach wisdom to humanity. In other words, they sow the seeds ofcivilization itself.Because the ancients were so fond of investing multiple layers of meaning intoone symbol, let’s take these connections to another level: Karnak, Delphi, andMt. Ararat (now the proven resting spot of Noah’s ark) all share the same dovesymbolism, are all associated with tall builder-gods or seven sages, and are allconnected by that triple step of Vishnu, the shape of a perfect isoscelestriangle. As astonished as I was by this connection, I believed it to be the endof the matter until I calculated that the heart of this particular trianglerests conveniently on the only piece of dry land in that part of theMediterranean, the island of Cyprus. In fact, the center point rests exactly onthe castle of Kolossi, a square-shaped tower reminiscent of the Ka’ba—theIslamic navel stone at Mecca—and the symbol for Mount Meru. In the 13th century,the tower would become the seat of a new generation of sages, the KnightsTemplar who, ironically, trace their practices to Temple Mount in Jerusalem,whose esoteric origins are echoes of Heliopolis—the original primordial moundfrom which the Egyptian temple tradition emanated.MAGNETICSA significant factor in the location of these temples and holy sites was thepresence of geomagnetic “hot spots.” Stories of people being sent flying by anelectromagnetic charge in a stone—usually quartz or magnetite—as though touchingit somehow grounded its energy, are legion. A study of the Rollright stonecircle in England, for example, revealed how the local magnetic field is drawnlike a whirlpool into the center of this Neolithic temple. Other studies haveshown that the earthen henges surrounding temples such as Stonehenge and Aveburyact as conductors of geomagnetism, wherein the stones are used to store anddirect the flow of terrestrial energy. At Avebury, the magnetic readings dieaway at night to a far greater extent than could be accounted for under normalcircumstances. When they charge back up at sunrise, the telluric current fromthe surrounding land is attracted to the chalk henge, and the magneticfluctuations of the site reach their maximum levels. This may reveal whytemple-builders such as the Egyptians often regarded temples as living organismsthat sleep at night and awaken at dawn.An exhaustive survey of the megalithic metropolis of Carnac, France, reveals howthe 4,000 stones arranged in up to 13 parallel lines, beginning and ending inegg-shaped stone circles, alternately amplify and release telluric energythroughout the day, with the strongest readings occurring at dawn. The processmirrors the phenomenon known as electric induction. The French scientist PierreMereux came to the conclusion that the menhirs at Carnac act like accumulators,the dolmens like coils, and the stone circles like concentrators andaccumulators. The specially chosen rocks, high in concentrations of quartz, arepiezoelectric, meaning they generate electricity when compressed or subjected tovibrations. Carnac and its 4,000-plus stones are actually positioned along 31fault lines on the most active earthquake zone in France, so it is in a nearlyconstant state of vibration, making the stones electromagnetically active.Clearly the menhirs were not planted here by chance—particularly given the factthat they were transported from 60 miles away—because their very presence andorientation is in direct relationship to the terrestrial magnetism. Suchmeasurements alone reveal why the temples were built where they were, and whythe degree of work that went into them belies their simple purpose asastronomical markers.The main beneficiary of the temple is the human body. Every human being on earthis composed of two-thirds water and thus has an electromagnetic charge;virtually every temple is situated above or near water. When the telluriccurrent is located over water, it tends to move in a spiral pattern, and inducesa corresponding charge in that most precious of liquids. Samples of water fromholy wells and other sacred places show an increase in the vorticular motion ofthe water as compared to ordinary water. This process actually produces acorresponding effect in the human body. Furthermore, the temple and its chargedenvironment stimulates the iron in the blood, as well as the millions ofparticles of magnetite suspended inside the human skull. Finally, fluctuationsin the local electromagnetic field can influence one’s state of awareness,primarily through stimulation of the pineal gland, which in turn can lead tovisions/hallucinations and altered states. In other words, a visitor to one ofthese sites, whether pilgrim or priest, is able to receive information morereadily from other levels of reality, which indeed was the precisely the purposeof these structures—the transformation of the individual into a god.SEVEN DEGREES OF PERFECTIONMost people would assume that such sensitive and carefully engineeredenvironments would have been protected from harm, and sure enough, they were.There exists, over the entire face of the globe, a kind of woven,electromagnetic grid. Bearing the name of one of the men who discovered it, Dr.Ernst Hartmann, the Hartmann grid is influenced by underground veins of water aswell as magnetic forces emanating naturally from the earth. Could a relationshipexist between temples and how this net seems to stretch around them?I came across a fascinating document by the geo-biologist Blanche Merz, in whichshe conducted readings at various temples and found that, in each case, theHartmann net was stretched into 18 lines around the structure, almost like aprotective membrane. Because of this, celebrated temples such as those atSaqqara, Karnak, Luxor, and Kom Ombu enjoy an immense “neutral zone,” in muchthe same way that the henge monuments in Britain direct and concentrate theelectromagnetic forces inside the temples in a controlled manner that isbeneficial to the individual. The Edfu Building Texts list these Egyptiantemples as the original primordial mounds of the gods. Merz went on to findother energy “hot spots” at Chartres, Santiago de Compostela, and a plethora ofIndian sacred sites. In Tibet she found that stupas (dome-shaped shrines) markedwith nagas (serpents) identify the places where the lines of the Hartmann netintersect, and that telluric energy is transmitted via the upright stones.There’s more. In the Funerary Texts at Saqqara there is a curious passage thatstates, “Seven degrees of perfection enable passage from earth to heaven.” Thissentence is widely interpreted as referring to a series of trials that the soulmust endure before gaining entry into the afterlife. Because the Egyptians werefond of allegory and metaphor, however, I wondered if the phrase might also bealluding to the doorway or threshold the individual crosses when he/she enters atemple—a “passage from earth to heaven” suggesting a crossing over from theprofane, material world into the heavenly otherworld, which neatly defines thepurpose of the temple. But that is only one door—where do the “seven degrees”come in?In Egyptian mythology, the passage of the soul into heaven is made through aplace called Sekhet Ianu, meaning the “fields of reeds,” after which the spiritreaches a paradisiacal land where it spends eternity. We simply know it today asthe Elyssian Fields. To reach this much-desired land one must pass through aseries of gates. During a visit to the temple complex at Saqqara I had theopportunity to study the entrance leading from the profane world into the grandcourtyard with its evocative stepped pyramid, engineered by Imhotep, anarchitect of the gods. This passageway is unique in that it is a colonnadeflanked by 18 pillars in the shape of reeds separated by narrow alcoves. Each ofthe alcoves discharges an alternating (positive and negative) electrical force,which serves as a barrier between the temple and the outside while it influencesthe body’s own electromagnetic “circuitry.” In essence, as you walk down thispreparatory entrance, you are suitably en-tranced prior to making contact withthe courtyard of the temple and its mansion of the gods.The numerical relationship between the 18 stone reeds and the 18 Hartmann linesprotecting the perimeter of temples is unmistakable. But for me, the revelationlay in the readings of the alternating energy field found at the entrance andits passageway of reeds, for it consisted of exactly seven positively chargedcurrents. Suddenly an answer to the “seven degrees of perfection” seemed closeat hand. Indeed, Merz’s own research revealed that at the very wide thresholdspreceding the initiatory rooms of the temples, the Hartmann net traverses theentrances with seven tightly packed grid lines protecting “the passage from theknown to unknown.” Seven gates can also be found in the ceremonial chamber atNewgrange, Ireland, where the pilgrim passes seven positively charged lines offorce in the chambered passageway before reaching the inner sanctum. Thispreparation prior to crossing the threshold between the visible and theinvisible is reminiscent of what occurs every year at Mecca, as Muslim pilgrimswind seven times in ever-decreasing spirals around the sacred center, the Ka’ba.GATEWAYS INTO PARADISETo help overcome the conditions of the material world that hindered initiatesfrom experiencing a state of oneness with the divine, they would source theenergy of such places of power and integrate themselves with the spirit ofplace, which helped them avoid such negative, limiting emotions as fear, anger,envy, and so forth. Once enlightenment was reached they would attain a state ofbliss—or, as many of us describe it, paradise. Interestingly, this simpleobservation can help us locate that longed-for land. In Avestan—the sacredlanguage of Zoroastrianism—paradise is pairi daeza, and literally means “awalled enclosure.” According to local traditions, a Jain who has mastereddiscipline over the physical world and achieved the state of godliness is calleda Jina. As this word migrated west it became the Arabic Djinn, along with itsderivative Allah-Djinn, or Aladdin. Back when Asia Minor was Assyria, a Djinnwas considered a supernatural being—perhaps not surprisingly, as the root j-n-nmeans “hidden.” However, it is also the root of jannah, the Islamic concept ofparadise. Its derivative in Portuguese—a language brimming with Arabic—isjanela, meaning “a window, an opening in a wall.” If we follow this dizzyingetymological trail to its logical conclusion, paradise appears to be a hiddenbut clearly demarcated space, separated from the ordinary and troublesome world,a “walled enclosure” we can reach through “an opening in the wall.”Every human being longs for some sort of paradise, whether an earthly one in thehere-and-now, or one later on, in the afterlife. In creating stone circles,pyramids, and other sacred structures, ancient architects were opting for “thehere-and-now” inasmuch as these walled enclosures—temples—demarcated one worldfrom the next. The measurable electromagnetic fields around their perimetersonly help to prove the point. The window into these walled enclosures are theliteral and figurative en-trances through which these deliberately directedelectromagnetic forces flowed, thus entrancing the individual as he or shepierced the veil between this world and the next. In creating these places ofpower, the ancients created sanctuaries where spiritual transformation wasachieved and paradise was experienced here on earth.NUMBERS AND KNOWLEDGEIn ancient texts, temples are often described as cities of knowledge. This isboth literally true (they often served as storehouses for texts and bodies ofknowledge) and allegorically true, for the temples—with their encoded numericalvalues, geometries, stellar alignments, and geomagnetic effects—were themselvesthe knowledge. They were designed to correspond to and reflect the perfect lawsof nature. The adepts recognized that the fate of the soul while trapped insidethe physical body was tied to a cosmos in which geography and the science of theheavens were inextricably bound, and that during its immersion in the materialworld the soul’s unhealthy connection to or over-investment in the body couldsever this intimate connection. As the historian Giorgio de Santillana andscientist Hertha von Dechend comment in Hamlet’s Mill, “Knowledge of cosmiccorrespondences led up to harmony on an infinite number of levels, and the rigorand absoluteness of number was the instrument with which these correspondenceswere determined and remembered.” In other words, the ancients reduced complexcosmic forces—for example, the 11.060606-year sunspot cycle—down to simplenumerical relationships and then applied those relationships to the constructionof their temples. For it was believed that by placing the body within anenvironment of near perfection, the forces present would effect an almostalchemical process on the living organism and return it to a state ofperfection.When examining the design of ancient temples as well as sacred literature, thenumerical values 18, 36, 54, 72, 108, and 144 crop up again and again, likehandy mnemonic devices. Interestingly, this seemingly haphazard series ofnumbers actually reflects the core angle of the pentagram—72—as well as itsdivisors and multiples. Why would the pentagram be important in the structure oftemples? Because the pentagram is actually the geometry of all living things.The cells in living organisms are pentagonal, and the proportions of nature’sspiral, as expressed by the Golden Ratio, closely follow those of the pentagram.Because temples work through correspondence, by applying the numerical valuesunique to the pentagram to their design, a correspondence is established betweentemple, planet, and humanity. If one extends this logic on a global scale byapplying the pentagonal numbers as longitudes—using the primordial mound ofHeliopolis as 0 degrees—each line of longitude bisects some of the most profoundoracles on earth: Easter Island, Angkor, the great stupa at Kathmandu, Susa, NanMadol, Arran, and even the original mound and obelisk at the Vatican.Another way this sacred knowledge was encoded into temples lies in theirdesigners’ use of angles associated with the movement of energy. For example, ifyou take the other two basic geometric building blocks of life—the tetrahedronand the sphere—and place one inside the other, the angle at which any point ofthe tetrahedron touches the surface of the sphere is 19.47 degrees. We know thatthis angle is important in the manifestation of energy because it also happensto be the degree of latitude on the surfaces of many planets where the greatestnumber of active energy “hot spots” are located: the Mauna Kea volcano on earth,the Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, the great red spot on Jupiter, and so on. Thetemple builders sought to amplify the power of these sites by relating them toeach other at this angle; the circumference of Avebury stone circle, forexample, is formed by an angle of 19.47 degrees mapped from the summit of itsnearby conical mound, Silbury Hill.THE ANGLE OF MANIFESTATIONThe amount of trouble the builder-gods and, later, the fully human architectswent to create places of power that intimately connect with and correspond tothe human body is easier to understand when you consider the relationshipbetween these sites and the very core of the human body, DNA. When you pile salton a table it forms a conical mound with a slope angle of 32.72 degrees. Theslopes of many ash volcanoes and other soft-particle hills are also defined bythis angle. It would seem that gravity causes fine matter to fall this way.There is even a close numerical correspondence between this angle and the speedof gravity, which is 32.17 feet per second.The mystery of 32.72 is so tantalizingly close to that mystical number 33 thatit’s worth stopping for a moment to consider the two. The Zoroastrian god, AhuraMazda, is said to have created the universe with the power of 33 steps.References to this secret process can also be found in the Qabalah. Through thethorough understanding of its 32 principles, one reaches the 33rd degree, orenlightenment. This knowledge would have been a component of the Mystery Schoolsin Heliopolis, later to become a closely guarded secret within the 33 degrees ofFreemasonry, whose roots herald from said academy.Is 33 just a convenient rounding-off of 32.72? After all, one cannot go aroundclaiming to be a 32.72-degree Mason. If so, why did the United States ofAmerica, a country founded by Freemasons, establish its border with Mexico atYuma where, in the middle of a river, it forms the tip of a pyramid precisely atlatitude 32.72 degrees? And why did the Knights Templar, the precursors of theFreemasons, build a castle on the Levant coast at 32.71 degrees, and another atVadum Iacob, exactly at 33 degrees latitude, both of which, when connected to athird one at Jericho, form a perfect right-angle triangle, a triple step ofVishnu? Stranger still, nearby Mount Carmel, the “vineyard of God,” lies at—youguessed it—32.72 degrees, while the transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Taboroccurred at 32.69 degrees. But let’s return to the Freemasons for a moment. Thetrue fraternity of Freemasonry is an echo of the Followers of Horus, the falcongod of the sky whose mission was to bring light to humanity. The light of thesky is embodied by the sun, and the solar year (365 days) divided by the sun’scycle (11.060606 years) equals 33. Conversely, the sun defined as acircumference of 360 degrees divided by 11 (the convenient number of the solarcycle) equals 32.72.All of this brings us back to temples and their corresponding effect on thatgreatest of structures, the human body. Let’s consider the two oldest sacredplaces on Earth: Stonehenge and Heliopolis. British chronicles dating from the12th century state that the stones of Stonehenge were brought all the way fromAfrica by a race of giants. Of course at least part of this story is incorrectsince we now know that some of the stones were sourced from a quarry in Preseli,Wales (actually aligned on a pentagonal longitude), and some from the nearbyWiltshire Plain. However, what may have come from Africa is the knowledge oftemple building, and a sufficient number of giants’ graves in this part of thetestify to the presence of a race of unusual magician-priests. Stonehenge itselfis now carbon-dated to 8000 BC, placing the original site within the era ofthose tall builder-gods, the Followers of Horus. So, if we apply the rule of thethree steps of Vishnu between Stonehenge (a temple of Light), its Egyptiancounterpart of Heliopolis (the city of Light), and the absolute north of theplanet (the North Pole), the angle subtending the two places of power is exactly33 degrees. But where is the explicit connection between the human body thetemple? The answer lies with a rather unusual looking pharaoh.By 1346 BC, Heliopolis had become a pale shadow of its former glory. In a suddendeviation from norm, the pharaoh Akhenaten moved the capital of Egypt to a siteat Til el-Amarna and named it Akhet-aten. His prime motivation was to wrest thetemple away from the power of an increasingly corrupt priesthood, which by thattime had already usurped control of the rituals and symbols and come to use thetemple as a method of crowd control. His secondary motivation was to return thefocus of worship to the monotheistic cult of Aten, the sun, which his father,Amenhotep III, had started in Thebes but failed to promulgate due to theprevailing politics. By doing this, Akhenaten revitalized the very concept uponwhich Heliopolis was founded, for Heliopolis, as a city of the knowledge thattransfigures the soul, was the perfect architectural expression of theveneration of Light. It was also home to the Followers of Horus, the falcon godof the sky who seeks to overcome darkness (ignorance) by avenging the death ofhis father, Osiris, god of light and guardian of the gate into Sekhet Ianu:paradise.At first glance Akhet-aten seems like a ludicrous place to build a city, letalone a capital. It was remote, 120 miles from the nearest complex at Abydos,encircled by desert, and with only the Nile providing an umbilical cord to therest of the world. But clues suggest a well-conceived plan: for one, in hisoblation to the Aten, Akhenaten praises the new capital as “the seat of theFirst Occasion, which he had made for [Aten] that he might rest in it.” To be a“seat of the First Occasion,” the site must have been an original primordialmound—in other words, it must stand on ground previously consecrated by theSeven Sages and the builder-gods 8,000 years prior to the 14th century BC. So ifwe do what Akhenaten did—take the former 33-degree angle marking therelationship between Stonehenge and Heliopolis and move it south to create a newrelationship with a new temple of Light at Akhet-aten—the exact angle betweenthe two sites changes to 32.72 degrees. So where does DNA come in?As I indicated previously, the human body contains a great deal of the oneelement that benefits most from being inside a temple. It consists of two-thirdswater, which turns into ice at exactly 32.72 degrees Fahrenheit. Water actuallycontains a combination of 33 different substances, offering life to the humanbody and its spine of 33 bones. Modern research shows that DNA is a remarkablyflexible molecule, and thermal fluctuations can produce bending, stretching, andun-pairing within the structure. In its normal state, the angle of rotation ofthe bDNA helix is 34.61 degrees, but in a dehydrated state, it changes intoaDNA, and its angle of rotation then becomes—you guessed it—32.72 degrees. Thisis how far the ancients went to situate their sacred sites in order to produce acorresponding effect on the human temple.108 DEGREES WEST OF HELIOPOLISIf you think that all of this has little bearing on modern life, think again,for the principles that once set the spiritual bar at such a great heightcontinue today in one form or another. Even during the dark times of the declineof ancient Egypt, the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, and the Inquisition,this knowledge continued to be taught, albeit underground (hence the termoccult, meaning “hidden”). In fact, this is what led to the enlightenment of theclassical Greek period, when notable scholars such as Plato and Pythagorasgraduated from the Mysteries Schools of Heliopolis. Indeed, Greek historianssuch as Herodotus attribute the rise of Greek culture directly to the Egyptiansand their fabled temple academy, later to be resuscitated in Alexandria. Groupsof adepts persevered under different guises to promulgate the teachings for thenext 3,000 years.The legacy of the temple and the cities of knowledge handed down from thecreator-gods before the time of the great flood didn’t just seek to benefit theindividual within the confines of sacred space, for its effects resonate farbeyond, sometimes encompassing an entire city. In Paris, for example, notablebuildings, boulevards, and cathedrals have been purposefully modeled overhundreds of years on alignments mirroring the temple complex of Karnak-Luxor,just as those alignments once mirrored the heliacal rising of Sirius, the starassociated with gnosis (spiritual knowledge and mystical enlightenment). By thismethod the temple builders hoped that whole cultures would be maintained inbalance indefinitely, the only uncertainty being the ego and the need ofindividuals to abuse power for narrow ends.Which brings us to a modern-day correspondence with the temple. One of the sitescorresponding to the global pentagonal grid lies in the Bay of Paracas in Peru.Here, on this desert hillside, lies an anomalous, solitary 300-foot tall Tree ofKnowledge etched deeply into the encrusted sand. The line of longitude on whichit rests extends north and marks the capital of one of the world’s newestcountries, whose Declaration of Independence was created by those new Followersof Horus, the Freemasons, which included George Washington and BenjaminFranklin. Likewise, exactly 108 degrees west of Heliopolis lies the dome of theCapitol in Washington, D.C. The purpose of this building, as Franklin himselfstated, “was to be the first temple dedicated to the sovereignty of the people.”In creating an ideal city dedicated to the liberty and freedom of theindividual, the restoration of light, and the transformation of the soul, thearchitects of Washington, D.C. (who were all French or American Freemasons)encoded the very facets of the temple in the orientation of the city’s wideboulevards as well as in the relative location of its primary monuments. Thus,in the positions of the White House, the Capitol, the Washington Monument, theLincoln Memorial, the Pentagon, and even the Grand Lodge of the Freemasons, areencoded the angles 19.47 degrees and 32.72 degrees, the pyramidal angle of 51.49degrees, and the octave in music. Its main thoroughfare, Pennsylvania Avenue—theavenue of the king—is aligned to the rising of the star of wisdom and the DivineFeminine, Sirius. This is far from a conspiracy or sinister plot; rather, it is,as it has always been, about the use of subtle energy. Energy is neutral: it canbenefit the greater good just as it can be abused by the few and used againstothers. History shows that the vacillation between tyranny and enlightenment hasmarked the slow, upward trajectory of human development, just as the templesthat have endured these changes were once nothing more than simple mounds risinglike pregnant bellies out of the land.Note to readers: All original references are from my book Common Wealth: TheOrigin of Sacred Sites and the Rebirth of Ancient Wisdom."},{"pageContent":"OUR SONIC PAST: THE ROLE OF SOUND AND RESONANCE IN ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONSBy Marie D. Jones and Larry FlaxmanIn a world driven by visual stimulation, sound has often taken a back seat inhow we perceive and process stimuli and information and give meaning to ourreality: “I’ll believe it when I see it,” “What you see is what you get,” and“Out of sight, out of mind.” We generally react more to what we see than what wehear, and we usually give more credence to the actions of others than we do tothe words they speak. But ancient civilizations understood the power andinfluence of sound. Not just any power, but a power that mirrored the creativeforce, perhaps the same force described in Genesis when God spoke the word, andthe world, into existence.MYSTERIOUS STRUCTURESIn the country of Bolivia, at 12,900 feet above sea level, near the city ofTiahuanaco (also known as Tiwanaku), at the center of the great terrestrialbasin of Lakes Titicaca and Aullagas, is a large monument complex called PumaPumku. The vast complex, now quite deteriorated due to age and exposure to theelements, was once a bustling spiritual and cultural center, along with thenearby temples, the Akapana Pyramid, and other ritual centers that served thepeople and priests of Tiahuanaco. What remains today are a series of opencourtyards, an esplanade, clay platforms, a terraced platform facing megalithicstones, and enormous stone blocks. Some of these massive stone blocks weigh inexcess of 100 metric tons. The largest stone slab, a part of the PlataformaLitica, the eastern edge of Puma Punku, weighs 131 metric tons and is carvedfrom red sandstone. Another block at the same site weighs in at “only” 85.21metric tons. Some of the stones are fitted so precisely that something as thinas a razor blade cannot be wedged between them. The holes bored into the stonesare of equal depth, and the cuts are perfectly straight. As if this were notenough of an enigma, factor in the transportation issues that must have beeninvolved. Petrographic and chemical analysis of these blocks by archeologistsindicates that they were somehow transported to the site over a very steepincline from a quarry just over six miles away near Lake Titicaca. Otherandesite blocks appear to have been transported from quarries about 55 milesaway across the lake. Add all this together and the site becomes a mystery ofarchitectural genius. How did they do it?Archeologists suggest the transport of such massive blocks of stone was madepossible by a huge labor force working slowly over many, many years. Somesuggest that the stone blocks were dragged up the steep incline to the site onramps. Still others suggest alien intervention, stating that no amount of humanlabor could have possibly moved these massive megaliths from so far away, andthen cut and arranged them with such preternatural precision. It certainly seemsimprobable that such a complicated endeavor could have been accomplished by anancient and presumably primitive civilization. Even with today’s technology,such a construction would be difficult, to say the very least. It would involvea knowledge of astronomy, masonry, and mathematics, among other things, andwould require intense and protracted planning. Yet no records of such knowledgeor planning have ever been found at the site. Was this ancient culture truly asprimitive as some historians would have us believe?At the southeastern point of the Polynesian triangle in the Pacific Ocean sitsthe volcanic island of Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island. Considered themost remote inhabited island in the world, Easter Island is also home tohundreds of huge stone statues called moai, which were carved between AD 1100and 1680. There are a total of 887 of these monolithic statues, some with justheads, others with torsos, and a few complete from head to toe. Carved out ofsolidified volcanic ash, or tuff, the moai were formed with stone chisels andsculpted by many people over the period of about a year. According to locallegend and lore, the statues represent the deceased ancestral lines of thoseliving on the island. The largest moai weighs 82 tons, and several others comeclose to that weight. Yet many of these statues—at least a quarter of them—hadbeen moved from the quarry at Rano Raraku, where the ash and tuff they were madefrom originated. Although theories abound as to how the statues were shaped,carved, constructed, and raised, there is no definitive theory as to how theywere moved. Interestingly, the Rapanui myths and traditions say it was mana, ora spiritual power, that literally “walked” the moai from the quarry to theirvarious destinations on the island.The famed site of Stonehenge, a massive stone circle in Wiltshire County,England, is one of many henge monuments built during the Neolithic and BronzeAges in England. (Henges are Neolithic earthwork sites that contain a ditch anda ring bank exterior to the ditch. Avebury in England is another famed hengesite.) Stonehenge may have been an ancient burial site, according to a May 29,2008 Associated Press article titled “Study: Stonehenge was a burial site forcenturies,” Cremated remains found at the henge site date back as early as 3000BC, and ritual burials may have continued for the next 500 years.Today, we know that Stonehenge was also a complex astronomical laboratory, inaddition to being a site of religious ritual, and it remains a place ofreverence even today. Yet there is no definitive theory as to how the buildersof Stonehenge moved or constructed the site’s bluestones, which most likely camefrom the Prescelly Mountains, some 240 miles away in Southwestern Wales. Theoriginal small bluestones weighed up to 4 tons, and 80 stones in all comprisedthe henge. Stonehenge was actually built in stages, the last known constructionoccurring in approximately 1600 BC. It is possible that the Neolithic technologyat that time could have created such a structure, but because the originalbuilders left no written records, we still cannot be sure who built it, how theybuilt it, and what they built it for.Manual labor could have hewn these stones, and certainly erected them, althoughit would have taken a great deal of time and manpower. How the stones managed toget to the henge site from 240 miles away is a whole other ballgame. Were theydragged on some kind of rollers, loaded onto barges, sailed up the Rivers Avonand Fromme, and then hauled to the henge site? The large sarsen stones that makeup the outer circle weigh up to 50 tons each and may have came from MarlboroughDowns, approximately 20 miles to the north. How did these massive stones getthere?Perhaps the most widely known and most mysterious of all the stone edifices isthe Pyramid at Giza, Egypt. Also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid ofCheops, it is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and a mystery ofmysteries for those seeking an understanding of ancient knowledge. The hugepyramid was constructed over a period of 15 to 20 years, ending in 2560 BC, andmay have served as a tomb for the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu. But what makes thestructure so awe-inspiring is the fact that the massive pyramid is made up ofsome 2.3 million limestone blocks transported from nearby quarries, and that theworkmanship is said to be so accurate that the four sides of the base have anaverage error of 58 millimeters. The design of the pyramid and its precisemeasurements have led many Egyptologists and historians to believe it wasintended as an homage to the number pi.But there is still controversy and debate over how this pyramid and many otherslike it—for example, those built by the Mayans and other Mesoamericancivilizations—were built, and who, exactly, built them. In his book The GreatPyramid: Ancient Egypt Revisited, John Romer suggests that the materials used tobuild the pyramid, which included 8,000 tons of granite and 500,000 tons ofmortar, were cut and gathered and then carried by boat up and down the NileRiver to the site. Laborers may have used the ancient Egyptian technique ofhammering wood wedges into the stones and then soaking the stones with water,which would cause the wedges to expand enough to break the stones. Most expertsagree the stones were either carried or lifted from the quarries to the site,but precisely how they were carried or lifted is unknown. Perhaps the ancientsmade use of a skill we have long since forgotten or ignored—a skill thatinvolves not hard, grueling, blood-sweat-and-tears labor, pullies, hydrauliclifts, counterweights, or ramps, but something quite different: sound.A SOUND THEORYThe concept of using sound to levitate or move solid objects is not a new one.Indeed, we wrote extensively about this in our book The Resonance Key: “Quitesimply, an acoustic levitator is nothing more than a resonance machine ofsorts—a way of introducing two opposing sound frequencies with interfering soundwaves, thus creating a resonant zone that allows the levitation to occur.Theoretically, to move a levitating object, simply change or alter the two soundwaves and tweak accordingly.” We generally don’t think of sound as having atangible or material presence. We can hear it, but certainly we cannot touch itor feel it. But think of the times you’ve heard a car driving by with the radioblasting, the bass turned up high and booming so loudly that it felt as thoughthe sound were coming from inside your car. Or think of someone going to thedoctor to have a kidney stone destroyed by a powerful ultrasound machine. Sounddoes have a physical presence, in the form of the sound waves that can affectthe environment and the human body. Scientists have successfully used theproperties of sound to cause heavy gases, liquids, and even solid objects (suchas spiders, goldfish, and mice) to float in the air. A quick Google search forsonic levitation will turn up a variety of YouTube videos showing waterdroplets, small critters, and various objects held in suspended animationbetween two metal objects: a transducer and a reflector. These objects oftenhave concave surfaces to keep the sound waves focused. The sound waves simplymove away from the transducer and bounce off of the reflector. When thetransducer is placed at the right distance from the reflector, a standing wave(a wave that remains in constant position) is created; depending on theorientation of the wave in relation to the pull of gravity, an object in one ofthe nodes of a standing wave—the points where the wave has minimalamplitude—will react as if gravity did not exist and appear to float between thetransducer and the reflector.If sonic levitation is possible for small objects, could it be possible forlarge objects, as well—even massive stone blocks weighing many tons? There is noproof that this has ever been done, but we do have some eyewitness reports ofjust such a theory being put into practice. We found one account in the book TheLost Techniques by Swedish civil engineer Henry Kjelson. Kjelson writes of theexperience of a friend of his, a certain Dr. Jarl, who was asked to go to aremote area of Tibet to tend to a high Lama. While there, he was taken to afield and shown first-hand how the Tibetan monks levitated large objects. Themonks began to play trumpet-like instruments while others beat on drums in frontof a large stone slab with a hollowed out central cavity, in which a smallerstone had been placed. Nothing happened at first, but as the tempo increased,the stone in the central cavity began to sway, and then hurled itself into theair and landed outside a cave entrance, the exact place the monks had intendedit to land. Dr. Jarl watched this process repeated over and over again as themonks moved up to five or six blocks each hour using this method. A similardemonstration was allegedly witnessed by an Austrian filmmaker known only as“Linauer” in the 1930s, this time in a remote part of Northern Tibet. The monkshere used type of gong made up of various metal alloys with a soft gold center.Another metal stringed instrument accompanied it, “played” by the vibrations ofthe gong. The sound of these instruments was directed toward large screensintended to amplify or direct the sound to move large blocks of stone.Perhaps the type of stone has a bearing on what kind of sound and frequency isneeded. For example, granite is a composite stone, which might make finding aresonant “match” more difficult, while limestone is a much simpler stone. Eachtype of rock used in the construction of all of these megaliths, pyramids, andother huge structures has its own resonant signature. Even the earth itself hasits own resonant frequencies, the most famous of these being the SchumannResonance of 7.83 Hz. Nikola Tesla used the earth resonances in much of hisgroundbreaking work in electromagnetic energy and wireless transmission ofelectricity.Knowledge of harmonics and sound might have allowed these ancient civilizationsto work with exact sound combinations to create the desired result, levitation.In the case of the Great Pyramid at Giza, the earth’s own energy field may haveplayed a huge role in not only how the pyramid was built, but its location, aswell. The Great Pyramid has interior walls that are constructed of rose granite,which is known for its resonant qualities. Acoustic experiments by engineers inthe upper chamber revealed a resonant frequency at 121 Hz, and 117 Hz inside thechamber’s granite box. The interactions between the two slightly differentfrequencies created a frequency that almost matched that of the human heartbeat.Many visitors and researchers at the Giza Pyramid report amazing resonantproperties in the King’s Chamber in particular, which resonates to an F-sharpchord, and the Chamber Coffer, which resonates to an A, the minor third ofF-sharp. Experiments by NASA consultant Tom Danley showed that the standingfrequencies (frequencies that remain constant when no interference exists)within the five interior rooms came to 16 Hz, an infrasonic level below thethreshold of human hearing. Danley then theorized that the pyramid’s dimensions,combined with the materials it is made of, intentionally served to amplify soundin the King’s Chamber. Again, the frequency pattern matched the tonal structureof the F-sharp chord. In his book The Giza Power Plant, Chris Dunn writes abouthis own research in the chamber, and suggests that the pyramid may have beenoriginally constructed with a sonic purpose. Other pyramid experts propose thatthis resonant “matching” created a sound-based energy that was used for healing.Perhaps the Pyramid at Giza was a giant sound transmitter and receiver, usingearth’s resonances outside, and the intricately designed acoustical propertiesinside.FROM EGYPT TO FLORIDAA more modern example of how sound may have been used to build a massive stonestructure is found in Homestead, Florida, the site of the Coral Castle.Considered the life’s work of Latvian immigrant Edward Leedskanin, the CoralCastle is a literal castle made of coral, with massive stones perched upon highwalls, a huge 28-ton obelisk, a 9-ton swinging gate, and walls consisting ofblocks weighing several tons each. Leedskanin began building the castle in 1920,cutting, transporting, shaping, and arranging more than 1,020 tons of coralhimself until he died in 1951. Although some of his neighbors claimed they sawLeedskanin transporting blocks of coral by truck, nobody ever saw him raisingthe blocks to make the castle. Leedskanin claimed that he had found the key tothe building of the pyramids using everyday weights and levers. However, he wasalso obsessed with magnets and earth energies, and some of his writingscontained references to a “magnetic current,” and cryptically allude to hisability to levitate objects. The idea that this slight man lifted massive blocksof coral with some type of electromagnetic current or frequency persists to thisday.Even Stonehenge has recently required its own resonant reputation after newresearch shows that the engineering of the standing stones may have beenintended to create the acoustic conditions for amplifying sounds within thehenge, possibly even for purposes of putting someone in a trance or alteredstate of consciousness. In a January 2009 article for UK Telegraph, universityprofessor Rupert Till showed that the stones might have been constructed for thepurposes of trance dancing, repetitive movements such as whirling or rocking.With a colleague, Dr. Bruno Frazenda, he not only conducted computerized soundexperimentation to prove his theory, but actually visited a concrete full-sizereplica of Stonehenge and used computer-based acoustic analysis software tocreate sounds and music. He and his colleague walked around the interior of thehenge, popping balloons in order to capture the impulse response of the stonecircle. (An impulse response consists of all the paths taken by a sound betweenits source and a microphone placed a few yards away, resulting in a kind ofacoustic fingerprint.) The result was akin to what happens when you run a wetfinger along the rim of a wine glass: it dramatically amplified the originalsound in such a way that it might have put those within earshot into a trancestate.In another article for MSNBC.com’s January 7, 2008 edition, Rossella Lorenziwrites about the Till experiments, but also discusses previous research byartist and archeologist Aaron Watson that corroborated Till’s findings. Watsonspecializes in the study of Neolithic monuments and theorized from his ownStonehenge research that “the monument’s builders knew how to direct themovement of sound.” The standing stones amplify high-frequency sounds such ashuman voices, whereas low-frequency sounds such as drumming reverberate off ofthe stones and can then be heard from great distances. It was all designed, asWatson states, to create a “dynamic multisensory experience.”Was this an accidental outcome of the design, or was it intentional? Did theseancient builders truly understand the power of sound, frequency, vibration, andresonance? Another great monument—the El Castillo pyramid at the Maya ruins ofChichen-Itza in Mexico—suggests that many ancient civilizations did understandthis power, and knew just how to harness it for ritual purposes. Chichen-Itza isa large pre-Columbian archeological site located in the northern center of theYucatán Peninsula. The El Castillo pyramid is a step pyramid of square terraceswith stairways up each of the four sides to a temple at the very top. On thespring and autumn equinox, at the rising and setting of the sun, the corner ofthe structure casts a shadow in the shape of a plumed serpent—Kukulcan, orQuetzalcoatl—along the west side of the north staircase. (Quetzalcoatl was ahighly revered Mesoamerican deity, and its iconography has been found throughoutthe Mayan and Aztec empires.) On these two annual occasions, the shadows fromthe corner tiers slither down the northern side of the pyramid with the sun’smovement to the serpent’s head at the base.Some visitors to El Castillo claim that a handclap produces a strange echo thatsounds very similar to the chirping of the Quetzal bird. By 2003, enoughattention had been given to this strange echo that it prompted four Belgianresearchers to take a more scientific approach to the connection. The resultingstudy was submitted to the December 2004 issue of the Journal of the AcousticalSociety of America. The team, led by Nico F. Declercq and Joris Degrieck of theSoete Laboratory at the Department of Mechanical Construction and Production atGhent University in Belgium, conducted a theoretical study of the specialacoustic effects of the El Castillo staircase, where the handclap/bird echo wasreported. Though the team already suspected that the bird chirp sound wasproduced by a normal phenomenon called Bragg scattering, no one had ever takenthe time to actually demonstrate it at the actual site. Ultimately, the teamexamined the recorded signals of a direct echo from a delta pulse against arecorded signal of a Quetzal bird in the forest, and a normalized recordedsignal of the pyramid echo. Their study involved comparisons with sonograms,measuring frequencies of the various sounds—even the “raindrop effect,” whichoccurs when people climb the pyramid stairs and their shoes produce sound pulsescontaining all the frequencies. They performed various experiments at the siteunder different weather conditions to test the relationship between the speed ofthe sound and temperature variations. Although the experiments bore out thescientists’ suspicions regarding Bragg scattering, the fact that they eventhought to do this kind of study is indicative of the universal desire tounderstand and appropriate sound and resonance as a way of effectingphysiological and environmental changes. Is it really reasonable to assume thatthe builders of all these amazing sites came upon these connections by accident?CUTS LIKE A KNIFEAlthough we’ve placed a great deal of emphasis on how sonic levitation mighthave been used to lift heavy objects, alter human consciousness, or engendertrance states, it may have also been used in the stone-cutting process. Considerjust how difficult the precise cutting and measuring of these stone blocks wouldhave been for civilizations that lacked the kind of technologically advancedpower tools that we take for granted. They may have had access to the mostpowerful tool of all, a kind of sonic jackhammer that could cut throughconcrete, stone, asphalt, and hard materials of every sort.NASA has taken both sonic levitation and sonic positioning (using sound to movesolid objects into different positions) seriously enough to develop a real sonicjackhammer, as reported in NASA’s May 1, 2005 Tech Briefs. A small-scaleprototype was actually demonstrated before the public. The jackhammer combinesthe use of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations to cut through materials, just as adrill would penetrate cement. Though this jackhammer was only a prototype,perhaps those civilizations that came long before us knew how to do this verything without any need of a machine or device. Perhaps the use of music,chanting, drumming, and a general understanding of the earth’s electromagneticfield and resonances was enough to allow them to create the most awe-inspiringedifices on earth, all with nothing more than the power of sound.BIBLIOGRAPHYDeclerg, Nico F. and Joris Degrieck, Rudy Briers, Oswald LeRoy. “A theoreticalstudy of special acoustic effects caused by the staircase of the El Castillopyramid at the Maya Ruins of Chichen-Itza in Mexico.” Journal of AcousticalSociety of America.

HanksThe exchange of knowledge between master and student is a timeless expression ofthe accumulation of human insight. Like some clandestine secret handed from themagi of old down to a new generation of protégés, the wisdom of the ancients issomething that many spend their entire lives seeking. This is because they knowthat this wisdom of the past is of inestimable value to future generations.Whether it be Sun Tzu’s treatises on the art of waging war, or the oncealchemical agents that form the basis of our modern sciences, we look to thepast to learn about ourselves and how to better our existence both today and inthe future. The details imparted to us in the particular exchange between masterand student that we will be examining here—though obscure at best—will introduceus to unforeseen possibilities that might change our very perspective regardingwho we once were, who we are now, and, perhaps most importantly, what we maybecome.To begin at what might have been one story’s ending, we arrive at the dawn ofthe atomic age, in the years immediately following World War II. This most direof modern global conflicts was considered the “war that would end all wars.” Ofcourse, ending this conflict came at a horrible cost: the loss of civilian lifeon a tremendous scale with what all assumed was first use in Earth’s history ofnuclear weapons during wartime.On the morning of August 6, 1945, at approximately 8:15 a.m. Japan time, theBoeing B-29 Superfortress bomber Enola Gay had entered airspace directly aboveHiroshima, where it dropped a free-fall explosive known to history by thenickname “Little Boy.” Within one minute, the bomb detonated over the city at analtitude of approximately 1,900 feet.1 [ch07.html#ch07not1] No large-scale enemyraid had occurred; a small fleet of U.S. aircraft had been detected andsubsequently ignored by early warning radar. For this reason, it was hoursbefore officers from the Japanese General Staff arrived to investigate why allthe radio stations in Hiroshima had gone silent.2 [ch07.html#ch07not2] Uponarriving within sight of the city, pilots were stunned to see only a vast pillarof smoke rising over the area. Announcers in broadcasts overheard by Alliedsources reported that, “[t]he impact of the bomb was so terrific thatpractically all living things—human and animal—were literally seared to death bythe tremendous heat and pressure set up by the blast. All the dead and injuredwere burned beyond recognition. Those outdoors were burned to death, while thoseindoors were killed by the indescribable pressure and heat.”3[ch07.html#ch07not3]This attack was followed by a similar blast that leveled the city of Nagasaki tothe southwest, prompting Japan’s surrender and thus ending the Second World War.As has been argued many times with due controversy since the end of theconflict, war always results in death, but killing on the scale seen in the daysleading up to Japan’s surrender also restored peace to the world…at least for awhile. Soon, however, the lingering fear that other countries—especiallyemerging superpowers such as the Soviet Union—would build their own atomicarsenals presented a terrifying new threat.Another result of humanity’s entry into the atomic age was the utter fascinationwith which the public regarded these weapons and their development. Asinformation about the Manhattan Project became public knowledge, J. RobertOppenheimer, dubbed the father of the atomic bomb for his involvement in theproject, became something of a celebrity, with his face emblazoned across thecovers of American magazines and newspapers. Oppenheimer would also beginlecturing about the scientific merits of this emerging nuclear technology, aswell as the necessity for alliances with different countries around the world,from which all could reap the benefit of mutual protection from the threat ofnuclear arms in the wrong hands.Of course, the blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki hadn’t been the first of theirkind. Oppenheimer had been among those at the famous test at Alamogordo, wherethe first successful detonation of a nuclear weapon (given the nickname“Trinity” by Oppenheimer) had occurred. Much later in 1965, Oppenheimer recalledhis feelings from that occasion during a NBC television appearance, saying that,“We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few peoplecried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture,the Bhagavad-Gita…‘Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I supposewe all thought that one way or another.”4 [ch07.html#ch07not4]Though Oppenheimer was the so-called father of modern nuclear weapons, there aresome rather strange circumstances involving this brilliant physicist that haveresulted in questions as to whether the test at Alamogordo was indeed the firstnuclear detonation in Earth’s history. On one occasion, during a seminarOppenheimer was giving at Rochester University on the development of nuclearweapons, a college student asked if the blast at Alamogordo had been the firstof its kind. Oppenheimer replied rather strangely by saying, “Well, yes, inmodern times.” This statement is troubling for a number of reasons. For one,Oppenheimer seems to be intimating that there had been other nuclear explosionsin the past that he knew about. Even if this were indeed found to be the case,where could any such blast have occurred, and who would have been responsiblefor it? Since Oppenheimer specifically referenced “modern times,” it would seemthat something akin to the blasts at Alamogordo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki hadonce transpired at some point earlier in Earth’s history.Logic would tell us, however, that it’s very unlikely that an ancient technologyever succeeded in harnessing the power of the atom as we have done in moderntimes. Some say that Oppenheimer was referencing the mysterious blast thatoccurred over Tunguska, a remote part of modern-day Russia, in 1908. Thisexplosion, however, was not the result of a man-made device, nor was it even anuclear blast, as it has since been determined that the concentration ofradioactive isotopes in the blast area after the incident did not match theexpected levels following a nuclear explosion.5 [ch07.html#ch07not5] So what,then, was Oppenheimer referring to? Did the brilliant physicist really make thisunsettling allusion to a student at Rochester during such a lecture? If so, whatare the implications? The surprising answers lie hidden deep within some of thelate physicist’s more esoteric interests, where we begin to see that he may havebeen referencing an event that occurred much earlier.It is well known that Oppenheimer was well-versed in the Vedic epics of India,particularly given his propensity to publicly quote Hindu scripture such as theBhagavad-Gita. Oppenheimer was also known to give copies of the Bhagavad-Gita tofriends as gifts, in addition to keeping a copy of the text on the bookshelf byhis desk.6 [ch07.html#ch07not6] According to British journalist Nilesh Prashar,at the funeral of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, Oppenheimer read an excerptfrom the holy text, which states in part, “Man is a creature whose substance isfaith, what his faith is, he is.” Oppenheimer also cited the volume as beingamong his 10 favorite and most influential spiritual books during an interviewin 1963.7 [ch07.html#ch07not7]The Bhagavad-Gita is merely one part of the greater epic known as theMahabharata, and one of two manuscripts (along with the Ramayana) thatconstitute the major Sanskrit epics of India. Of particular relevance to thediscussion of nuclear weapons and their potential existence in ancient times, wefind mention of something curious in the Mahabharata—specifically, during theepic battle said to have taken place between rival nations of the ancient world.If we accept this as a literal account of an armed conflict that took place inancient times, we are left with the curious mention of a variety of weaponswhich seem to resemble modern firearms, advanced aircraft, and even explosiveswith devastating potential that resemble nuclear armaments. The late AlexanderGorbovsky, who served as an expert at the Russian Munitions Agency, wrote aboutthis in his 1986 article “Riddles of Ancient History,” where he mentionsreferences to a “terrible weapon” in the Mahabharata. “Regrettably, in our ageof the atomic bomb, the description of this weapon exploding will not appear tobe an exaggeration.”8 [ch07.html#ch07not8] Following is the passage to whichGorbovsky is referring. Despite having been authored almost 3,000 years ago, itseems to describe something all too familiar to us today:[A] blazing shaft possessed of the effulgence of a smokeless fire (was) letoff…. This makes the bodies of the dead unidentifiable…. The survivors losetheir nails and hair, and their food becomes unfit for eating. For severalsubsequent years the Sun, the stars and the sky remain shrouded with clouds andbad weather.The weapon described here, variously referred to in the text as the Weapon ofBrahma, the Flame of Indra, or the Iron Thunderbolt, causes various kinds ofailments to living beings, in addition to atmospheric damage. During the early1960s, it was shown that high-altitude testing with megaton nuclear explosivesresulted in the creation of artificial belts of radiation in space. Although itis uncertain whether such radiation belts would cause the “clouds and badweather” described in the Mahabharata, great concern about long-term atmosphericeffects have been expressed by the likes of Sir Bernard Lovell, the director ofthe Radio Astronomy Laboratories at Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics.9[ch07.html#ch07not9] The late Herman Hoerlin, a leading expert on the physics ofhigh-altitude nuclear detonations, also noted in a 1976 study that “recentstudies of a possible relationship between certain auroral displays in the northand weather do not exclude the hypothetical possibility of artificialweather-modification by nuclear energy releases.”10 [ch07.html#ch07not10] On agreater scale, however, it was thought that the effects of a fullblown nuclearholocaust could result in a nuclear winter, in which the smoke and soot fillingthe air following the detonation would block sunlight, thus reducingtemperatures over large areas or even worldwide. Citing a 2006 study on thepotential devastation following a nuclear winter, Science Daily reported that“even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could produce as many directfatalities as all of World War II and disrupt the global climate for a decade ormore, with environmental effects that could be devastating for everyone onEarth.11 [ch07.html#ch07not11]The descriptions of this massive weapon in the Mahabharata are thought toindicate some kind of projectile, perhaps lending to its description as a “bolt”that strikes locations from above:[It was] a single projectile charged with all the power of the Universe. Anincandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as the thousand suns rose inall its splendor…it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a giganticmessenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis andthe Andhakas.Soldiers then “throw themselves into streams to wash themselves and theirequipment.”12 [ch07.html#ch07not12] Interestingly, this line is reminiscent ofindividuals attempting to ward off the effects of radiation poisoning. Accordingto the Merck Manual online medical library, initial treatment for exposure toradiation involves careful removal and storage of the individual’s clothing (toaid in preventing further contamination), followed by bathing wounded areas andthen the rest of the skin.13 [ch07.html#ch07not13]This portion of the Mahabharata appears to describe an event that bears morethan a passing resemblance to what we now know of modern nuclear weapons andtheir attendant dangers. But is it reasonable to infer that ancient nuclear warswere indeed occurring on Earth prior to civilization as we know it today, basedsolely on the descriptions given in an ancient Sanskrit holy text? Arguably,some portions of the Mahabharata, much like the epics of other ancient cultures,are necessarily comprised of fantastical narratives that incorporate themythologies, values, cultures, and imaginations of its author, all presented asdirect reportage. Take, for instance, the remarkable flying craft known asvimanas that were described in some detail in many of the Sanskrit legends.These craft resemble everything from modern aircraft to popular depictions offlying saucers and UFOs. Could there be any factual basis for such thingsexisting thousands of years ago, especially when descriptions of theircapabilities seem to exceed what modern avionics has achieved? Remarkably, theintricacies pertaining to the design and mechanics of these craft are describedat various times throughout the Vedas, with mention of “engines” that consist ofan iron enclosure housing mercury or a similar substance that, when stimulatedin some way (electrically, perhaps), could cause a vortex to occur within theswirling liquid metal, thus manifesting a strange energy source capable ofpropelling these flying vehicles to great altitudes at tremendous speeds.Though remarkable and imaginative, these sorts of descriptions—replete withdetails that appear to describe a technologically advanced society—have promptedmany a modern researcher to consider whether the Vedas do indeed containevidence of some ancient, advanced society. Imagine if they were the lastremaining written accounts of some even older civilization which, thoughforgotten today, was remembered well enough thousands of years ago that attemptswere made at cataloguing its various innovations. Perhaps this monumental taskwas undertaken by people who themselves had only a vague remembrance of theseearlier exploits—and even less knowledge of the technology they were attemptingto document.One researcher who has carefully and exhaustively examined the technologydepicted in the Vedas is Peter Thomson, an instructor at Napier University inEdinburgh who has authored books and articles on everything from green energy,holistic diets, and computer systems that integrate biological life forms, toattempts at finding credible evidence for ancient civilizations and prehistoricnuclear weapons. In his article “Unexplained Flying Vehicles” on his Website,Thomson describes his research into what he calls a charged sheath vortex, adevice inspired by and designed to operate based on the aforementioneddescriptions of a “swirling mercury engine” from the Sanskrit epics.(Incidentally, this is very similar to the “implosion technology” developed byAustrian inventor Viktor Schauberger in the 1920s and ‘30s, which itself wasbased on tornado-like fluidic vortices, or whirlpools, and similar vortexmovements found in nature.14 [ch07.html#ch07not14]) Regarding the appearance ofsuch advanced concepts in ancient texts, Thomson states the following:There is simply too much consistent and working technology in [the Vedas]. Thesestories can only be fragments of history from the distant past. Twisted,altered, misremembered, but still enough technology remains in these accounts tosay with a lot of certainty, we are not the first technological civilization onthis planet.15 [ch07.html#ch07not15]Granted, it may require a suspension of disbelief for anyone to assume that theVedas, as Thomson writes, “can only be fragments of history from the distantpast.” After all, the Vedas could certainly be discussing other things just aseasily, especially in the absence of any scientific evidence of ancienttechnological innovations on par with modern atomic weaponry. However, accordingto Thomson, the finest evidence for advanced technology exists not in thesefascinating descriptions of aviation and engineering innovations in the Vedas,but instead in our planet’s archaeological, geological, and climate data.For instance, the ability to manipulate our environment using technologyinvolves the acquisition and practical use of essential metals such as copper,lead, tin, and iron. Thomson notes that mining for such metals, along with theensuing smelting and processing of usable quantities, resulted in traces thatcould be observed in glacial deposits around the globe, relative to the timeperiod when such industrialization began. Thomson argues in his article that theindustrial development of ancient Greek and Roman societies left a clearsignature out, stating that nuclear fission could also be traced in such a way.Any evidence of a nuclear war and the ensuing period of nuclear winter wouldlikely be found within the cores of coral reefs, formed out of calcium carbonatesecreted by marine organisms over the centuries, and in the beds of rivers andlakes left undisturbed for long periods of time.16 [ch07.html#ch07not16] Otherevidence that would be observable in the geological record might include theextinction of large swaths of animal populations in various regions andhabitats, as well as stone and sand melted by the sudden, intense heat at thesite of an explosion, resulting in the formation of glass, called trinitite. Ifwe were to find evidence of such conditions spanning a relatively short periodof time in geological history, we might indeed have a case not only for ancientcivilizations, but also, given the right sort of evidence, perhaps even for aclearly traceable nuclear event—or even several of them—in prehistory.Remarkable though it may seem, many of these criteria have been found, mostcoinciding with the end of the last Ice Age. Thomson notes evidence of expectedincreases in traces of metals such as iron and copper; of the extinctionresulting from an intelligent species proliferating and encroaching on thehabitat of megafauna in the locale; of uranium concentrations in coral; and evenof the presence of glass-like fused sand and stone at a number of ancient sites.This information serves as the rationale for a bold emerging hypothesis thatperhaps a technologically advanced civilization did exist in ancient times.Thomson argues that[this civilization] mined and smelted copper, lead, tin and almost certainlyiron…and destroyed all the megafauna predators from all continents…. Itdeveloped a nuclear capability and then destroyed itself in a nuclearholocaust…followed by a nuclear winter that returned the world to an ice age fora further 1000 years.17 [ch07.html#ch07not17]Speaking more specifically, physical evidence for a nuclear event, or possibly aseries of them, exists, as well. A paper written by scientists William Toppingand Richard B. Firestone states that anomalous radiocarbon readings wererecovered from the Great Lakes region of North America: “The entire Great Lakesregion (and beyond) was subjected to particle bombardment and a catastrophicnuclear irradiation that produced secondary thermal neutrons from cosmic rayinteractions.”18 [ch07.html#ch07not18] Granted, the event to which the authorsrefer took place in Paleo-Indian times. Moreover, because conventional wisdomholds that nuclear devices simply couldn’t have existed so long ago, the authorspropose instead the theory that a supernova was likely to blame: “The size ofthe initial catastrophe may be too large for a solar flare,” they say, althougha “significantly powerful nearby supernovae or cosmic ray jet could account forit.”19 [ch07.html#ch07not19] Obviously, this is only a theory, and as such itdoes not definitively prove that such natural phenomena caused a nuclear eventin ancient times. But left to consider the troubling alternative—namely, thatancient humans may have possessed a greater degree of technical proficiency—whatare we to think of explanations that point to the existence of ancient nuclearweapons? Despite the controversy that rages between these two polar oppositepositions, one thing is obvious: a nuclear event or events apparently did takeplace in ancient times, and proof of this does exist. Regarding a technologicalprimum movens behind the nuclear event(s) in question, however, there may indeedbe evidence that brings us to an even more unsettling conclusion involving ourancient ancestors and what dreadful technology they may have possessed—despitewhat conventional history has taught us for so long.The excavations of the ancient cities in the Indus River Valley have for yearshinted at evidence of something curious and potentially frightening. The citiesof Harrappa and Mohenjo-Daro in particular (both in modern-day Pakistan) boast anumber of anomalies, beginning with their curiously advanced technologies. OfMohenjo-Daro the late professor Ahmad Hasan Dani said that the city, at the peakof its development more than 3,000 years ago, was likely the most developed andhighly advanced city in all of South Asia.20 [ch07.html#ch07not20] And yet, thecities in this region seemed to have suffered a rather sudden catastrophe atsome point in their history. Despite the kind of innovation and success they hadonce seen, something managed to destroy them while they were in their prime.Theories of their demise focused primarily on flooding of the Indus River. Evenas recently as 2010, devastating floods that resulted from several months ofheavy rain resulted in widespread destruction and the deaths of more than 2,000people throughout the region.21 [ch07.html#ch07not21] But flooding, even of thismagnitude, might not account for the other sorts of anomalies found atMohenjo-Daro and Harrappa.For instance, researcher Philip Coppens has written about radioactivity in theregion that was purportedly high enough even in modern times that birth defectsand cancer have seen a much higher incidence in parts of the region, promptingthe Indian government to impose restricted access to certain areas. Some of thismight be due in part to negligence at a power facility in the region, from whichcontaminated wood was brought into the surrounding community and burned, therebycausing at least some of the radioactivity. What cannot be argued, however, isthat “a layer of radioactive ash was indeed found in Rajasthan, India,” asCoppens notes, covering a far wider area than isolated incidents ofcontamination would account for. In fact, Coppens states specifically that theradioactivity “covered a three-square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur.”22[ch07.html#ch07not22]But heightened levels of radioactivity in the region are only one indicator ofwhat may have occurred around Harrappa and Mohenjo Daro thousands of years ago.Alexander Gorbovsky also mentioned the discovery of human remains that containedunusual levels of radiation at the Mohenjo-Daro site. This idea, among others,has been examined by explorer and researcher Jonathan Gray, who discussed suchthings in his book Dead Men’s Secrets. The excavations of early Mohenjo-Darorevealed skeletons of people who, curiously, were found lying in the streets ina similar fashion to the casualties of Pompeii. Gray suggests that theskeletons, some of which were allegedly found holding hands, “are still amongthe most radioactive that have ever been found, on a par with those of Hiroshimaand Nagasaki.”23 [ch07.html#ch07not23] Gray also notes that the Mohenjo-Darosite boasts a 150-foot epicenter, where “everything was crystallized, fused ormelted,” and that “180 feet from the center the bricks are melted on [only] oneside, indicating a blast.”24 [ch07.html#ch07not24] What has been described hereis the sort of sudden melting of solid matter, a process known as vitrification,which, as we surmised earlier, is something we’d expect to find at an ancientblast site. It is no surprise to learn that the vitrification of solids occurrednot only at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also at the earlier explosion site whereOppenheimer and his associates witnessed the famous Trinity blast. Thus, ourunderstanding of the name given to the “Alamogordo Glass” residue found in theaftermath of such explosions—trinitite— is made clear. What is not clear,however, is what the source of radioactivity and similar vitrification atancient sites was. Some have suggested that the impact of a large meteoritemight have caused the vitrification process if an explosion occurred in theaftermath; but if we recall the famous Tunguska blast of 1908 (the cause ofwhich was likely a meteorite), we see that the levels of isotopic radioactivityfollowing the blast were far too low to be consistent with a nuclear explosion.What the evidence found at these ancient sites seems to point to is not only ablast with tremendous destructive potential, like that at Tunguska, but alsosomething that clearly resulted from a nuclear event, and which, curiously,seems to have been directed at specific targets such as Mohenjo-Daro. But evenif a compelling case for ancient nuclear explosions and technology that involvedatomic weaponry exists, as seems to be the case, we still must ask why so littleevidence of the ancient civilizations that produced them remains today. If ahighly advanced civilization existed thousands of years before our own, it seemsreasonable to assume there would at least be some remnants of their technologystill known about or in use somewhere in the world today, in the form of ancientstructures, roadways, monuments, and/or other traceable evidence. Thisassumption may not be entirely accurate, either. In his book The World WithoutUs, journalist Alan Weisman ponders just how the great mark of civilization leftby humanity would look as it disappeared, given a hypothetical situation inwhich there were no longer any people around to develop and maintain technologyand infrastructure.25 [ch07.html#ch07not25] Weisman theorizes that mostresidential neighborhoods would be overtaken by flora, returning to the forestedstate that predated them by 500 years. By the time a few thousand years hadpassed, “the world would mostly look as it did before humanity came along—like awilderness.”26 [ch07.html#ch07not26] In his 2005 Discover Magazine article,titled “Earth Without People,” Weisman presented a number of scenarios thatshowed just how quickly the forces of nature would erase evidence ofcivilization:The new wilderness would consume cities, much as the jungle of northernGuatemala consumed the Mayan pyramids and megalopolises of overlappingcity-states. From AD 800 to 900, a combination of drought and internecinewarfare over dwindling farmland brought 2,000 years of civilization crashingdown. Within 10 centuries, the jungle swallowed all.27 [ch07.html#ch07not27]Weisman’s research places the longevity of our infrastructure in rather soberingperspective. Even in major U.S. cities such as New York, he states, within amere 100 years, oak and maple trees would begin to cover the landscape; it wouldbe another 900 years, however, before landmarks such as the Hell Gate Bridgefinally collapsed. But of all the lasting effects our species might have in thelong term, Weisman notes that radioactivity leaking from nuclear sites such asthe Indian Point nuclear reactors just north of Manhattan could continue fortens of thousands of years.28 [ch07.html#ch07not28] If we once again considerthe possibility that someone had nuclear capabilities here on Earth long ago,perhaps it comes as no surprise that the best evidence we have for theirexistence is measurable level of radiation at those proposed nuclear blastsites, which remain even in the present day.If we choose to accept the terrifying possibility that there really was anuclear war on Earth sometime during our prehistory, the potential ramificationscan tell us a great deal about our past; however, they also indicate much aboutwho we are today. They indicate an aspect of our human nature—specifically, ourpropensity to destroy one another—that has been with us since the beginning oftime, and though we’ve managed to evade impending crises and wholesaledestruction thus far, the threat of what could await humankind if a full-onnuclear conflict ever occurred still lingers. Despite our certainty that ouraccomplishments will be remembered for all time, this legacy could very easilybe undone, especially if we manage to jump-start the process of erasingourselves from the geological record through the assured self-destruction thatnuclear weapons promise. In a world where the threat of terrorism and dangers ofthis sort have become all too real, perhaps it is even more critical that wegain a deeper understanding of the mistakes of the past and perhaps even acceptthe possibility that our existence as we know it may not be the first of itskind.J. Robert Oppenheimer seemed to know all this, and as we have now seen, it wasno coincidence that was so fascinated with the ancient texts of the Mahabharataand the Bhagavad-Gita. Similar knowledge has been expressed in other ancienttexts, too. Even the great philosopher Plato surmised in his Critias dialogue,with the fabled and supposedly highly advanced city Atlantis as its focus, that“nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which wassaid to have taken place between those who dwelt outside the Pillars of Heraclesand all who dwelt within them.”29 [ch07.html#ch07not29] Indeed, it seems thatwise men of both today and of ages past knew that something remarkable hadoccurred in our prehistory; but what we choose to do with this same knowledge,bestowed on us by masters such as Oppenheimer and Plato, remains to be seen.Oppenheimer himself must have wrestled with the terrible potentials that camealong with the forbidden knowledge he unlocked. The secrets of theancients—whose very existence here long ago was betrayed by their technology,unearthed in bits and pieces over the years—may also be the keys to a veritablePandora’s box. Unless we use them wisely, they could still unlock the certaindestruction of our future and of humanity itself, which by all accounts may havealready been destroyed.NOTES1 [ch07.html#ch07not1a].

For example, it is an established andundeniable fact that Adolf Hitler and many of his cronies, including RudolfHess, Otto Rahn, Heinrich Himmler, and Walther Darré, were profoundly intriguedby such issues. Hitler himself had nothing less than a full-blown obsession withthe fabled spear or lance—the so-called Spear of Destiny—that supposedly piercedthe body of Jesus during the crucifixion. The reason for that obsession: tosecure the spear and harness its mysterious might as a weapon to use againstAllied forces. However, as the account goes, Hitler utterly failed in his quest,and as the conflict of 1939–1945 came to an end, the spear eventually came intothe hands of General George Patton. According to legend, attempting to use thespear for negative purposes or even recklessly losing it was to guarantee one’sdemise—a prophecy that was apparently fulfilled when Hitler killed himself asthe Nazi regime collapsed around him in 1945.image [../images/f0132-01.jpg]The Spear of Destiny, about which Adolf Hitler and high-ranking Nazis during theSecond World War were so obsessed. Painting by Fra Angelico, circa 1437–1446.As for Otto Rahn, who made his mark in a wing of Germany’s greatly feared SS, hespent a significant period of time deeply engaged in a quest to find the HolyGrail, which according to Christian teachings, was the dish, plate, or cup usedby Jesus at the legendary Last Supper. That the Grail was said to possessawesome and devastating powers spurred the Nazis on even more in their attemptsto locate it, and then employ those same powers for their own sinister purposes.Thankfully, the plans of the Nazis did not come to fruition, and the Allies werenot pummeled into the ground by the mighty power of God or of any such artifact.Acknowledged by many historians as being the ultimate driving force behind suchresearch, Heinrich Himmler was perhaps the only high-ranking official in theThird Reich who was concerned with matters ancient and enigmatic. In 1935,Himmler became a key player in the establishment of the Ahnenerbe, which wasbasically the ancestral heritage division of the SS. The chief purpose of theAhnenerbe was to conduct research into religious artifacts; however, itsinterest and work also spilled over into areas such as the occult—the latter,primarily from the perspective of determining if it, just like the Holy Grail,could be useful in further strengthening the Nazi war machine.So much for Nazi Germany. Far less well known, however—and certainly barelydocumented until now—is the profound extent to which the various agencies andmilitary units of the U.S. government exhibited extraordinary interest inpuzzles of a distinctly archaeological and historical nature. It is a trulystrange story that delves into such intriguing areas as the nature of Noah’sArk; claims that the pharaohs of ancient Egypt may have possessed secretknowledge of levitation; the theory that a number of biblical accounts mayactually have had their origins in early visitations from aliens; and much, muchmore.ASTRONAUTS OF THE ANCIENT VARIETYBorn on March 12, 1910 in Jefferson County, Ohio, George Wellington Van Tasselmaintained that he experienced years of face-to-face contact with humanlikealien entities, following a claimed encounter in August 1953 near his YuccaValley home in California. The complete history of Van Tassel’s exploits withapparent extra-terrestrials is highly bizarre, involving weird accounts ofmeetings with imaginatively named aliens, including Numa of Uni; Ah-Ming ofTarr; Rondolla of the Fourth Density [sic]; and Zolton, the Highest Authority inthe Sector System of Vela. Van Tassel also suggested that many widely held andcherished beliefs relative to matters of a biblical nature were, in reality,distorted tales of extraterrestrial visitation from a fog-shrouded past.Notably, such beliefs caught the deep attention of none other than the legendarydirector of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover.The intriguing details of Van Tassel’s initial encounter of August 1953 weredetailed for Hoover in a classified memorandum prepared on November 16, 1954.The report described how, at around 2 a.m. on the day in question, Van Tasseland his wife were camping outdoors in an area near Landers, California—knownlocally as Giant Rock due to a huge, ancient rock that dominates the desertlandscape—when something truly amazing occurred. According to the FBI, VanTassel was awakened from his slumber by nothing less than an alien entityattired in a one-piece outfit, similar to those worn by fighter pilots at thetime. It then invited Van Tassel to tour its craft, which had touched down nearGiant Rock. Van Tassel told FBI agents who visited his home in 1954 that thevehicle in question was bell-shaped and around 35 feet in diameter. He claimedthat the aliens described it as a scout craft.image [../images/f0134-01.jpg]Giant Rock, California, where George Van Tassel allegedly met aliens who toldhim that the Bible was based upon distorted tales of ancient alien visitation.Author’s photo.As for the aliens themselves, Van Tassel said they conversed only via telepathy.Their specific purpose for visiting the Earth: to carefully warn humankind thatthe ever-growing atomic arsenals of the superpowers—the United States and theSoviet Union—posed a direct and catastrophic threat to the future of all life onEarth. Unless the human race changed its ways, he was told, our world would soonbe destroyed by our own hands. Galvanized and spurred on by the words of warningand wisdom from his alien visitors, Van Tassel then went out and preached thegospel of E.T. to just about anyone who would listen. And plenty listened: from1954 onward, Van Tassel elected to hold yearly flying saucer–themed conferencesout at Giant Rock, which, at their height in the mid-1950s, attracted audiencesin excess of 12,000 people. His claims provoked as much intrigue and attentionas they did rolling of eyes. But what really caught the attention of the FBIwere Van Tassel’s assertions that Christianity had been borne out of alienvisitation—ancient astronauts, as they have come to be known.On April 17, 1960, Van Tassel gave a lengthy speech at the Phipps Auditorium inDenver, Colorado, having been invited to do so by the local Denver UnidentifiedFlying Objects Investigative Society. To ensure that the lecture was aresounding success, the society took out advertising time on local radio, whichcaught the attention of the Denver FBI office, who subsequently directed aspecial agent to clandestinely attend and report back the details of VanTassel’s speech. The secret FBI summary of Van Tassel’s presentation began asfollows:The program consisted of a 45 minute movie which included several shots ofthings purported to be flying saucers, and then a number of interviews withpeople from all walks of life regarding sightings they had made of suchunidentified flying objects. After the movie George W. Van Tassel gave a lecturewhich was more of a religious-economics lecture than one of unidentified flyingobjects (FBI, 1960).It was this “religious economics” aspect of the speech that made J. EdgarHoover’s finest sit up and take notice. The special agent in attendance noted ina lengthy report prepared two days later, stated:The major part of his lecture was devoted to explaining the occurrences in theBible as they related to the space people. He said that this is due to the factthat man, space people, was made by God [sic] and that in the beginning of theworld the space people came to the earth and left animals here. These were theprehistoric animals which existed at a body temperature of 105 degrees; howevera polar tilt occurred whereby the poles shifted and the tropical climates becamecovered with ice and vice-versa (Ibid.).Van Tassel went on to say that alien visitors populated our planet with otherspecies of animals to ensure that life on Earth continued following the Ice Age,and that it was this specific action that gave rise to the legend of Noah’s ark.On the issue of other Biblical tales and stories, Van Tassel continued thatfollowing the aforementioned polar tilt, aliens from a faraway world establisheda male-only colony on Earth, intending to bring the females on what were termedsupply ships at a later date. This, Van Tassel said, was “reflected in Adam nothaving a wife. Adam was not an individual but a race of men” (Ibid.). Further,according to the FBI’s now-declassified records: “[Van Tassel] said that thisrace then intermarried with ‘intelligent, upright walking animals,’ which racewas EVE [sic]. Then when the space people came back in the supply ships they sawwhat had happened and did not land; but ever since due to the origin of ADAM,they have watched over the people on Earth” (Ibid.).Part of that program of secret surveillance, asserted Van Tassel, included thealiens ensuring that the human race was taught certain rules, regulations, andmorals as part of a concerted, purposeful effort to control and manipulate.Those same rules, regulations, and morals, claimed Van Tassel, were in actualitynothing less than the legendary Ten Commandments, as provided to Moses on MountSinai by what the Christian faith claims is God. Van Tassel’s bold assertion wasthat the Ten Commandments had nothing to do with any God whatsoever, Christianor otherwise; rather, the Commandments were actually “the laws of thespace-people” (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1960).Also borne of the very same space-people, Van Tassel told the audience at thePhipps Auditorium, was Jesus Christ himself, whom Van Tassel described as beingthe product of Mary, “a space person sent here already pregnant in order to showthe earth people the proper way to live” (Ibid.). And it was not just theseBiblical narratives that Van Tassel wished to describe and interpret for thebenefit of his listeners. In his opinion, the activities of the ancient visitingaliens and their fantastically advanced spacecraft was also the reality behindcertain centuries-old Native American Indian stories that suggested that “cornand potatoes, unknown in Europe, were brought here by a ‘flaming canoe’”(Ibid.).It can easily be argued that all of this merely represents Van Tassel’s uniquepersonal opinions, and that the FBI’s only reason for taking careful, secretnotice of the man and his assertions was because he was making a wealth ofcontroversial claims and, in the process, significantly influencing the mindsetsof literally tens of thousands of people in a God-fearing, predominantlyChristian nation: the United States of America. In other words, perhaps theFBI’s interest in Van Tassel only resulted from the fact that he was asubversive who attracted attention wherever he went. There is, however, evidenceto suggest that there may have been far more to matters than just that—muchmore, in fact. The U.S. government’s secret interest in ancient astronauts,biblical puzzles, and times long past extends far beyond the thought-provokingtheories of Van Tassel.MOON DUST AND THE ARK OF NOAHIt is highly intriguing that the FBI took careful note of George Van Tassel’sbeliefs concerning Noah’s legendary ark. More than a decade before Van Tasselbegan speaking out publicly on this particular matter, senior and powerfulelements of the U.S. government were diligently compiling secret files on themighty and renowned biblical boat. In the Bible, in Genesis chapter 6[ch06.html#ch06], verse 13, we read: “God said unto Noah…make thee an ark ofgopher wood…. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: the length ofthe ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and theheight of it thirty cubits.” So much for what the Bible says, but what, ifanything, does the U.S. government know of this particular issue? Let’s take alook.Early on the morning of June 17, 1949, a U.S. Air Force aircraft quietlyembarked upon a top secret mission to secure imagery of Soviet missileinstallations reportedly being constructed near the Turkish border, along withphotographs of the 17,000-foot-high Mount Ararat in Turkey—the alleged finalresting place of Noah’s ark. As the pilot took the plane to a height ofapproximately 15,000 feet, the chief photographer aboard the aircraft was amazedto see what looked like a gigantic, man-made object—possibly 500 feet long andpartially buried within an ice cap on the southwest edge of the mountain. Theastonished crew quickly maneuvered the plane in an attempt to get a better view,which they most certainly did. As the pilot closed in, those aboard the aircraftcould now also make out what looked like a second huge object, this one on thewestern side of the mountain. It appeared to be a massive wing protrudingthrough the ice. It will surely surprise no-one to learn that the photographs,after having been developed, were quickly stamped Top Secret. And so theclandestine connections between the ark and officialdom were set in motion.Gregor Schwinghammer of the U.S. Air Force’s 428th Tactical Flight Squadronviewed the first anomalous object while flying adjacent to Mount Ararat in thelatter half of the 1950s. Whatever the nature of the massive object,Schwinghammer said its appearance gave every impression of having slid down themountain before reaching its final resting place. Moreover, he heard that thepresumed Ark of Noah had apparently been the subject of another photographicmission around the same time, involving the super-secret U-2 spy plane. It waslater revealed in 1997 that at the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, a CIAspy satellite secured photographs of a boat-like structure on Mount Ararat. DinoBrugioni, a retired CIA photography specialist who was tasked with studying thephotographic evidence at the time, confirmed the authenticity of the pictures,and stated that they showed something worthy of study, even if its actualidentity remained unclear. Echoing Brugioni’s words were those of a DeepThroat–like source—a retired high-ranking intelligence official—who advised theWashington Times, also in 1997, that one such picture revealed a trio of huge,curved wooden beams sticking prominently out of the thick ice.A remarkable and related story came from Don Riggs, whose father worked in thefield of photographic analysis for the National Reconnaissance Office. Accordingto Riggs, just prior to his death in 1997, his father revealed a startling storyconcerning records and photographs on Noah’s ark that had been referred to theNRO for analysis by a small group of personnel stationed at Wright-Patterson AirForce Base in Dayton, Ohio, in the latter part of the 1960s. Riggs added thathis father told him the file referred to a secret operation called Project MoonDust, an organization that Riggs’ father was previously unaware of, and how MoonDust personnel had begun to take a notable interest in the Ararat mystery justprior to the 1970s.Ostensibly, Project Moon Dust had been designed to acquire and secure for thehighest echelons of the U.S. military crashed Russian spy planes, satellites,rocket boosters, and space capsules. The purpose: to further advance U.S.technology, spacecraft, and weaponry. There is, however, ample data to show thatMoon Dust was involved in the recovery of far more than mere Earth-based spacetechnology, particularly in the 1960s. Official documents declassified under theterms of the Freedom of Information Act demonstrate that in addition to secretlycoordinating the retrieval of Soviet space debris and spy planes, Moon Dustpersonnel were also mandated to investigate “reliably reported unidentifiedflying objects” and to recover “other items of great technological interest” ofa specifically non-Soviet nature (Redfern, 2007). Certainly, the object in thephotographs that Don Riggs’ father saw would fall firmly into the lattercategory. Riggs stated that his father discussed with him his knowledge of sevenphotographs that appeared to show the ark at very close quarters. He furtherexplained that two of the photographs displayed what was, beyond any shadow of adoubt, a very large, metallic, rectangular object partly protruding out of theice on Mount Ararat. Whatever the object was, the testimony of Riggs Sr. seemsto suggest it was far more than just a large old wooden ship.Interestingly, Don Riggs’ father is not the only person who has claimed aWright-Patterson Air Force Base link to the story of Noah’s Ark. LieutenantColonel Robert Livingston was working at Wright-Patterson in 1954 in an officeof the Topographic Engineering Center, which had its primary base of operationsat Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Livingston revealed that one morning in 1954, an AirForce captain brought into the office a single photograph that had reportedlybeen supplied by the U.S. attaché at the Turkish Embassy. Livingston recalledthat the photograph clearly showed a long, dark, oblong structure that waspartially obscured by a sheet of ice. He and his team were ordered to make anevaluation of the dimensions of the strange formation, which they duly did aftercarefully scrutinizing the photograph. Whatever its true origins, the object wasclearly huge. The fact that Robert Livingston’s team was linked with FortBelvoir’s Topographic Engineering Center is very notable. It was within theheart of Fort Belvoir’s 1127th Air Activities Group that none other than ProjectMoon Dust personnel had their base of operations.image [../images/f0140-01.jpg]A NASA photograph of Mt. Ararat, Turkey, the alleged final resting place ofNoah’s Ark. Photo courtesy of NASA.Whatever lies buried deep below the ice of Turkey’s Mount Ararat, it seems safeto say that it is not merely the broken, weathered remains of a large, ancientvessel. To attract the highest echelons of U.S. Intelligence, the Ararat enigmamust have represented something far more significant, perhaps even thelong-buried remains of a crashed alien spacecraft that inadvertently led to theformation of the legend of Noah’s ark, as postulated by George Van Tassel. And,that Project Moon Dust personnel played an intimate role in the affair stronglysuggests that the presumed ark possessed advanced and coveted technologies of anincredible nature.PYRAMID POWERThe controversy-filled theory that certain of humankind’s most impressive andlegendary constructions, such as the pyramids of Egypt, were built by, or withthe extensive assistance of highly advanced extraterrestrial entities is onethat provokes a great deal of interest and attention. The popular publishedworks of Morris Jessup, Robert Charroux, and Erich von Däniken make thatabundantly clear. Far less well known, however, is that the U.S. Intelligencecommunity has also taken a keen interest in matters of such an ancient andenigmatic nature. As prime evidence of this, we have to focus our attention onthe groundbreaking work of a man named Bruce Cathie.Cathie, a retired airline pilot based in New Zealand, presented a theorysuggesting that (a) there exists throughout our planet what might be termed apower grid that UFOs, piloted by alien entities, use as a source of energy whiletraversing the skies of planet Earth, and (b) that technology broadly fittingthis particular description was also employed in the movement and manipulationof the gigantic stones of the Egyptian pyramids. It was in the late 1960s thatCathie first began to air his views on such matters. He asserted that it wasludicrous to suggest that the thousands of stone blocks used in the creation ofthe pyramids were quarried, shaped, and hauled into place by nothing strangerthan the brute force strength of thousands of slaves. Perhaps Cathie was righton target: one Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Mas’udi, otherwise known as the Herodotus ofthe Arabs, was a 10th-century writer who prepared an immense, 30-volume seriesof texts that recounted the history of the world based upon his extensivetravels. Within the pages of these texts, al-Mas’udi noted that in Arab legendthere existed an intriguing story suggesting that the creation of the Pyramidshad absolutely nothing to do with ropes, pulleys, or prosaic manpower. Rather,centuries-old lore that had come his way during his journeys suggested thepyramids were created by what we would today call definitive levitation.The incredible story that al-Mas’udi uncovered went something like this: whenbuilding the pyramids, their creators carefully positioned magical papyrusunderneath the edges of the mighty stones. Then, one by one, the stones werestruck by what was curiously described as a rod of metal. Lo and behold, thestones slowly began to rise into the air and, like dutiful soldiers followingorders, proceeded in slow, methodical, single-file fashion a number of feetabove a paved pathway surrounded on both sides by similar mysterious metal rods.For about 150 feet, Al-Mas’udi recounted, the gigantic stones moved forward,usually with nothing more than a gentle prod from the keeper of the mysteriousrod to ensure they stayed on track, and would then softly settle back to theground. And so the strange task was repeated until all the stones arrived attheir final destination. Once the stones were all accounted for, they werestruck once more, but this time in a fashion that caused them to rise everhigher into the air. When the stones reached their designated locations, theywere carefully (and amazingly easily) manipulated into place, one by one, untilthe huge pyramid was finally complete.image [../images/f0142-01.jpg]Were the Pyramids built using the mysterious power of levitation? Photograph byEduard Spetterini, 1904.Such a scenario might sound more suited to a blockbuster sci-fi movie than ahistorical text. As Bruce Cathie rightly noted, however, the conventionaltheories for the creation of the Pyramids—namely, that they were solely the workof slaves, using rollers, pulleys, ropes, and constructed ramps—were beset bymajor, nearly insurmountable problems. For starters, some of the massive stonesused in the creation of the pyramids (many of which weighed more than 70 tons)originated in quarries more than 600 miles from where the pyramids now stand.Another problem was that literally millions of stones were used, which begs thequestion of where the massive number of trees came from that had to have beenchopped down and converted into rollers? Certainly not from the barren desertsof Egypt, that’s for sure! In Cathie’s mind, there was one answer and one answeronly to explain how the gargantuan stones were moved: levitation byanti-gravity.All of which brings us to the relationship between Bruce Cathie and the U.S.government. In the 1960s, when Cathie’s groundbreaking research was coming tofruition, he contacted U.S. Defense personnel at Wellington, New Zealand,chiefly as part of an effort to have his views heard by officialdom. He hopedthis might assist him in his quest to uncover the truth about the so-calledEarth grid. Having outlined to U.S. authorities his theories and conclusions, itis eye-opening to note that Cathie was not dismissed by the U.S. DefenseDepartment; in fact, he received the opposite response. Referring to Cathie as a“lean, wiry New Zealander, with an apparently above average knowledge ofmathematics,” a formerly classified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency reportdated February 1968 reveals that American intelligence agents were not onlydeeply fascinated by Cathie’s theories and findings, but had also secretlyundertaken background checks on the man himself: “No adverse reports are known,”noted the DIA. And, there is evidence to show that Cathie’s digging into suchcontroversial areas as UFO grids and levitating stones attracted even deeperofficial attention—and possibly secret surveillance of the man himself (DefenseIntelligence Agency, 1968).A recently declassified Department of Defense document dating from May 1968references complaints the Department received from Cathie to the effect thatgovernment personnel were secretly tailing him. According to the story thatCathie told American officials, for some time he had suspected he was beingspied on by stealthy government agents, but he was not certain of this untilApril 1968, when he was accosted in the lobby of the Grand Hotel inInvercargill, New Zealand, by three Americans. Cathie alleged that theyattempted to have him accompany them to an unknown location—he had the goodpresence of mind to decline—which Cathie believed may have been a naval vessel,because he had heard that U.S. Navy personnel were in the area at that time.Cathie wasted no time informing the DoD that his work had been cleared at thehighest levels of the government of New Zealand, including the Prime Minister.Cathie added in stern tones: “Call your agents off. I have official approval tocontinue my work; I don’t want them tailing me” (Defense Intelligence Agency,1968).Precisely why Bruce Cathie would have been surveilled by elements of the U.S.Intelligence community is, sadly, ultimately unclear. Did he stumble upon thetruth behind the UFO controversy and its links to the secrets of how thePyramids of Egypt were really constructed? It’s difficult to say for sure. UFOpropulsion systems, long-lost antigravity and levitation technology in the handsof the pharaohs, classified Department of Defense files, and a covertsurveillance operation—all key components in the remarkable life and work ofBruce Cathie.ANCIENT ARTIFACTS AS WEAPONSFinally, we come to what might very well lie at the heart of U.S. governmentinterest in bygone eras and their attendant amazing tales of incredibletechnologies, levitating stones and rocks, mighty and massive arks, andlong-dead “astronauts” that were really immortal gods. Just as the Nazis hadduring World War II, it seems that elements of the American ruling elite had andcontinue to have vested, secret interest in commandeering the ancient wonders ofour world for military gain. It is here that we have to turn our attentions toan entity that inspires as much fear and dread as it does awe and lust forpower: the Djinn.The Djinn are supernatural entities of Arab lore, and key players in thenarratives and beliefs of Islam as outlined in the Qur’an. They are said toinhabit a strange and twilight realm that coexists alongside our own—anotherdimension, one might be very much inclined to suggest. Whereas we are purelyflesh and blood, the all-powerful Djinn are the product of flame and fire, andcan be as playful and benevolent as they can be malevolent and downright deadly.Indeed, some Djinn are widely believed to have an inexorable andinextinguishable hatred of the human race.One of the most learned scholars of Djinn lore is anomalies researcher andauthor Philip Imbrogno. In 1995, Imbrogno made a trip to Saudi Arabia, duringthe course of which he learned of secret, long-term attempts by an elite, covertunit of the U.S. military to actually try and capture Djinn. The purpose of theprogram, Imbrogno was told by official sources, was to secure for the U.S.government a highly advanced technological device that permitted the Djinn topass through solid matter, and also through what were intriguingly described as“dimensional windows.” It scarcely needs mentioning that if such phenomenaltechnology did exist, the possible outcome of its use as a tool of the militarywould be beyond imagination. To what extent the operation was successful,Imbrogno did not find out, unfortunately. If such an extraordinary goal had beenachieved, however, Imbrogno was advised it would undoubtedly have beenclassified at an extremely high level. Similarly, while visiting Oman on thesame trip, Imbrogno heard a story of the governments of Oman and the UnitedStates trying to make some kind of a deal with Djinn.Surely no one needs to be told that Faustian pacts involving military personneland dimension-hopping, ancient Middle Eastern entities bent upon the destructionof the human race should not be entered into lightly, if ever. Even theslightest hint that such pacts may have been initiated is something that mayexplain why the U.S. government has for decades exhibited a deep and abidingsecret fascination for ancient mysteries. That such meddling actions from ourmilitary might ultimately prove infinitely disastrous and costly to the entireplanet, is something that one hopes officialdom is keeping in mind.BIBLIOGRAPHY(Note: All Websites were accessed in May of 2011.)Al-Ashqar, Umar Sulaiman.

On one side ofthe debate you have the religious camp insisting that we descend from a singularact of supernatural creation. On the other side—and many times in directopposition to the religious camp—is the scientific community, which ofteninsists that Homo sapiens came about via several discrete stages of evolutionaryascendancy, before reaching the plateau of our current state of development. Butthere is a third distinctive camp of thought, which posits the alternativetheory that humans are a race interrupted, that somewhere in our primordial pastour genetic makeup was altered in so abrupt and swift a fashion, and in such asweeping manner as to forever change the course of our development and break theknown laws of the evolutionary process and natural ascendancy.The notion of ancient alien interruption is not a new one. Its loudestdefenders, a group that includes such notables as von Däniken, Drake, Downing,Sagan, and Sitchin, have been writing and theorizing on the topic for decades.Ever since early humans first gazed up in wonder at the star-blanketed nightsky, we have been intrigued by the seemingly unanswerable questions posed by amysterious and unattainable universe. Early mythologies and legends speak ofmysterious objects roaring across the heavens. Shards of ancient tablets andshreds of ancient documents describe phenomenal, unexplained manifestations inthe skies. And virtually every culture and religion contains an oral and writtenhistory of visitations from angels, demons, devils, and gods who made contactwith humanity in ancient times. The human race in its infancy described thesevisitations from the sky in the only terms it could understand—they weredeities.“Young earth” creationists will tell you that the biblical record accounts foran earth that is a mere 6,000–7,000 years old, whereas science has established avastly older history of human ascension, going back at least 200,000 years forthe beginnings of modern man. The recent discoveries of ancient temple complexessuch as Gobekli Tepe near the village of Karapinar, Turkey, which itself datesback to about 12,000 BCE, have turned the established nomenclature of civilized,city-building humanity on its ear.CREATION AND THE FIRST FAMILYTaking a biblical story and meticulously unpacking all the elements, whetherhistorical, spiritual, literary, or cultural, is an important process necessaryin the understanding of any ancient culture, really. Simply put, the Bible is ameans for us to enter into and understand the ancient anthropology of humanityitself. Depending on your view of the veracity of biblical scripture, its pagesmay reveal myths, legends, fables, stories, or real-life accounts that mirror orare mirrored by the various cultures of the ancient world. The importance of theBible, if not for faith and the practice of any one religion, is that itdemonstrates another view of certain events that were experienced and thenrecounted by ancient historians. When you take a step back from the text,removing the sometimes rose-colored glasses of dogma and systematic theology,you can start to read between the lines and observe the vastness of the ancientworld rising up before your eyes.Most of us grew up learning a spiritual story that explained the creation of theworld. And most of us are familiar with that first couple, Adam and Eve, and howGod commanded them to not eat any fruit from a certain tree in the Garden ofEden (“lest they die”), and how Eve was subsequently tempted and then persuadedby the Serpent to take some of the fruit from this Tree of the Knowledge of Goodand Evil, thus bringing about the introduction of sin into the world and theFall of humanity. We probably learned how the first couple were then barred fromParadise and given the command to “be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earthwith offspring.” With the birth of Cain and his twin brother, Abel, the worldsaw the embryonic stages of humanity itself.Virtually every culture the world over has some kind of account regarding thecreation of the earth and of humanity. Of course, some of these stories borderon hyperbole and fairy tale, and include such improbable elements as gods orgreat human warriors casting beasts and animals into the skies to create theswath of heavenly constellations. For example, certain African and NativeAmerican accounts describe subterranean humans coming to the surface of theearth, and “gods” from the heavens impregnating their beautiful daughters withquadruplets.1 In Lakota accounts of the first human family, for example, Waziya,the Old Man, and his wife, Wakanka, come out into the world from underground.(Compare this narrative to the Genesis account, in which Adam is “formed out ofthe clay of the ground.”) Their daughter, Ite, is so beautiful that shecaptivates the attentions of Tate, the God of the Wind, who then marries her andfathers quadruplets. Another character, Iktomi the Trickster, tempts the firstfamily with promises of great wealth, power, and beauty. In this way, Iktomibears great resemblance to the Old Testament’s account of Lucifer, who appearsas a snake and tempts Eve in the Garden of Eden, promising eternal life andgodlike knowledge if she eats fruit from the forbidden tree at the garden’scenter. In all of these tales, disobedience and treachery against God/the godsresults in banishment from an aboriginal paradise. Lucifer and his Lakotacounterpart, Iktomi, are exiled and cursed to roam the earth for all time, whilethe first families go on to bear children and spread their kind throughout theworld. The similarities between these disparate versions of creation areobvious. The fact that all such tales of creation are so similar satisfies atleast one of the requirements of the scientific method. Rather than requiringthe reader or historian to test the authenticity of each individual tale on itsown, the improbable similarities—cutting across the lines of race, culture, andeven time itself—stand as a corporate monument to a sort of “common law”veracity. In other words, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.In the Genesis account of Adam and Eve, the fall of all humanity is a directresult of disobedience. People often ask how the entire human race could havebeen cursed for all time because of one small bite from an apple. My answer tothis is that merely eating some fruit (which, by the way, is never identified asan apple) was not the issue; the issue was Eve’s direct disobedience of acommand mandated by the Divine. As a direct result of this violation, and ofluring her husband, Adam, to share in that disobedience, the Fall comeshammering down with devastatingly permanent effects.MY BROTHER’S KEEPERAfter this ostensibly fictional (or at least symbolic) beginning to thenarrative, the story begins to take on the characteristics of direct reportage.In Genesis 4:1–5 we read that Adam and Eve gives birth to two sons, Cain andAbel:1 [ch09.html#ch09not1] Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnantand gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the LORD I have broughtforth a man.” 2 [ch09.html#ch09not2] Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.3 [ch09.html#ch09not3] In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits ofthe soil as an offering to the LORD. 4 [ch09.html#ch09not4] And Abel alsobrought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. TheLORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 5 [ch09.html#ch09not5] but onCain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, andhis face was downcast.Even in the original Hebrew, it’s not clear whether Abel is born as a secondchild, years later, or whether, similar to the African and Lakota creationmyths, this is a multiple birth. But based on what little evidence can be foundin the verbiage of the text, the brothers are most likely twins.As the story goes, Cain is a “tiller of the ground,” a farmer who grows thevegetables important to the survival of his family. Abel is a sheep herder,raising meat for the same purpose. As they go to worship their creator, Abelkills and then sacrificially burns a sheep on the altar as his offering to God.Cain, on the other hand, a farmer laboring in the fields, offers up a percentageof his crop at harvest time, burning it in sacrifice on the altar in the samefashion as the sheep. But while Abel’s offering is a sweet, acceptable sacrificeto God, Cain’s is not. God rejects Cain’s offerings because there is no bloodsacrifice involved. In biblical times, blood was considered to be Life itself,and the process of blood sacrifice as described in this passage is aforeshadowing of the Kinsman Redeemer, the Messiah who will one day come andredeem all of humanity by the spilling of his own blood. A system of symbolicsacrifices developed over the millennia and eventually carried into thetabernacle and temple worship in Jerusalem. While Cain’s offering appears to befrom his heart, apparently it is not what is prescribed or necessary to pleaseJehovah.It is very interesting that while God comes down and communicates with hiscreation, he does nothing to hinder the savage murder of Abel. He speaks plentyto the future murderer, but does nothing—nothing that is recorded in thepassage, at least—to warn Abel. While this is a subjective observation, it isnoteworthy that the only thing God does to assuage Cain’s anger prior to themurder is to warn him that he needs to retain his self-control and not give sinan opportunity to take hold of him. Again, nothing is said to the unwittingAbel:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 7 Ifyou do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what isright, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must ruleover it. (Genesis 4:6–7)Later there is harsh judgment from God when he talks with Cain face-to-face.Consider for a moment what it would be like if the creator of the universeinteracted with you on a personal basis as you proceeded through life, guidingyou and warning you of various perils. Cain seems to hold a special place in theeyes of God, for we read nothing of this kind of chummy interaction between Godand Abel. Cain is warned to not let sin gain a foothold, but Abel doesn’t hear aword about how to protect himself from his brother’s anger. If we take thisstory at face value, this seeming inability to grasp the consequences of sintells the tale of a very young civilization, indeed, one with very littleexperience in dealing with the harsh realities of the dark side of human nature.Yet, for some reason, God keeps focusing on Cain, and Cain, in a fit of jealousyover his twin brother’s position with God—and in anger over his own rejection bythe Divine—takes his brother out into the field and murders him. When God asksCain where his brother is, Cain replies with the famous question: “Am I mybrother’s keeper?”EAST OF EDENAs a result of the murder, God brands Cain with a strange, special mark of somesort and banishes him from the region of Eden, destined to wander as an exilethe rest of his days. In the meantime, Adam and Eve have their third son, Seth,and Eve holds him up as a replacement from God for her murdered son. In thisaccount of the aftermath of Cain’s murder of Abel, take special note of theemotions of Cain. Then take note of what God does by way of judgment and howCain reacts:10 The LORD said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out tome from the ground. 11 Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground,which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 12 Whenyou work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be arestless wanderer on the earth.”13 Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today youare driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will bea restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”Cain is obviously very concerned that if he is found by other people, he will beexecuted. While there is no civilized system of jurisprudence in place, Cainbelieves that his life is in danger for killing his brother. Of course, all ofthis begs the question of whether any other people existed at the time of themurder. Unfortunately, the meticulous detailing of genealogies found in mostother parts of the Old Testament are missing from this account. Was therealready some sort of system of laws and rules in place? Were there courts orleaders who judged people for the breaking of societal laws and mores? Was thereeven a society at all? Who could possibly kill Cain if, indeed, only he and hisparents had been left alive after Abel’s murder? Again, taken as directreportage, the story seems to indicate one of two things: either there wereother descendents of Adam and Eve not mentioned in the passage, or other peoplewere already living and dwelling in the regions outside of Eden—other people whomight be inclined to take Cain’s life. Cain was clearly afraid to leave Eden.God addresses Cain’s concerns as follows:15 But the LORD said to him, “Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffervengeance seven times over.” Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one whofound him would kill him. 16 So Cain went out from the LORD’s presence and livedin the land of Nod, east of Eden.Remember, Adam and Eve had been ousted from the Garden of Eden, not thegeographical region,2 so the first family probably never wandered very far fromJehovah’s care and protection. But protection from what or, more probably, whom?And what of the “punishment” of the mark of protection placed on him? In thecase of Abel’s murder, there would be no “eye for an eye,” “tooth for a tooth,”or “blood for blood.” Cain was merely sent away with a mark that would enablehim to live out the rest of his days as a wanderer in safety.It is when we read of Cain’s progeny in verse 17 of Chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04]that the narrative comes to a screeching halt: “Cain made love to his wife, andshe became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch.” If Adam, Eve, and Cain were theonly three living human beings on earth, who was this woman whom Cain marriedand where did he find her? She is never mentioned as being part of his familytree. Theological apologists will tell you that this woman and the inhabitantsof her region were none other then descendents of Adam and Eve’s other children,who had migrated away from the Edenic region over the course of many, manyyears. They will also assert that Cain and Abel may have aged hundreds of yearsbefore the events of the first murder and banishment, thus providing anundefined period of time for the branching out and resettlement of anexponentially multiplied tree of Adamic offspring:17b Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 ToEnoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was thefather of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.19 Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 20 Adah gavebirth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raiselivestock. 21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who playstringed instruments and pipes. 22 Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forgedall kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.23 Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech,hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.24 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.” (Genesis4:17b–24)Before we go any further in the text, note the bittersweet, poignant end to thispassage in which we learn that Adam and Eve have a third child, a son whom theyname Seth. Eve pronounces him a gift from the Lord to replace her murdered son,Abel. This would seem to indicate that she had no other male children betweenthe time of Abel’s murder and the birth of Seth:25 Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named himSeth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cainkilled him.” (Genesis 4:25)It is this very same Seth who later dwells in Nod with his older brother, Cain,the murderer of his other older brother, Abel.WHAT’S IN A NAME?Other than Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, there are no other members of the Adamicfamily listed in the Hebrew scriptures at the time of Abel’s murder. There is nogenealogical record, no exhaustive listing of names—nothing. Banished from Eden,Cain leaves behind the only two other people mentioned in the Bible as being onthe earth at that time, Adam and Eve. He goes out into a world void ofinhabitants and civilization, east to the land of Nod. Once there, the passagetells us that he makes love to his wife, whom he has either brought with himfrom Eden (meaning it was one of his sisters not named in the account of thefirst family) or met in his wanderings. She, in turn, bears him a son, whom Cainnames Enoch. And there in the land of Nod, Cain builds a city (most likely awooden enclosure around a few huts) in honor of his new son and names it afterhim.Of the actual history of this little city we know very little, but of its namewe know a great deal. Without entering into too much detail regarding thechanges in pronunciation that occur naturally during the course of thedevelopment of a language, the letter N in Hebrew is often pronounced as an R.Likewise, the ch sound in Enoch may be replaced by either a k, g, or gh sound.These sorts of linguistic changes are very common in ancient tongues, and thenames of biblical city mounds—or tels—remained virtually unchanged over thepassage of millennia. All of this points to an important city in antiquitycalled Uruk. A study of the cuneiform writing of that time reveals that it couldalso have been pronounced Unuk, which is recognized as another iteration of thename Enoch.3What is perhaps more interesting is that the name Uruk/Unuk became synonymouswith the word “city”—not an average, run-of-the-mill city, but a city of greatimportance. The root meaning of the word actually translates as “the firstcity.” Although Moses (generally considered to be the author of Genesis) wassometimes guilty of giving ancient places names that were more current in hisday, many later scribal changes were also made to his manuscripts. While it isan historical fact that he lived from roughly 1526 BCE to 1406 BCE, he mentionsthe cities of Pithom and Ramses, which didn’t exist until some 200 years afterhe died. That said, he makes a point to mention that Cain’s city was calledEnoch/Uruk.Nod is the Hebrew root of the verb “to wander,” and is obviously an etymologicalnod (if you will pardon the pun) to the wandering, nomadic lifestyle of Cain andhis future putative descendants, the Kenites. This sort of play on words istypical of rabbinic writings and suggests that this is a later scribalinterpretation, more than likely inserted to suggest that Cain’s descendantswere “without territory”—in other words, nomadic. Additionally, the Hebrewlanguage did not exist prior to the time of Abraham, who lived some 4,000 yearsafter the time of Cain. The language Cain and his descendents would have spokenwas probably a Nilotic/Kushitic language closer to Old Arabic (Dedanite).THE MISSING LINK?In Intelligent Life in the Universe (coauthored with I. S. Shklovski), CarlSagan asserted that “our tiny corner of the universe may have been visitedthousands of times in the past few billions of years. At least one of thesevisits may have occurred in historical times.” Sagan, both an astronomer andexobiologist, as well as an established atheist and reasoned skeptic, theorizedthat Earth may have been visited by various “galactic civilizations” many timesduring earth’s primordial past. He also insisted that it was not entirely out ofthe realm of possibility that extraterrestrial artifacts and remnants ofvisitations and even entire civilizations may still exist, or even that somekind of alien base is still being maintained within our solar system to providecontinuity for successive expeditions.Such a hypothesis coming from a respected a scientist such as Carl Sagan actedas a catalyst for many in the ufological community and field to come forwardwith the idea that humanity may have been the result of alien “seeding” orextraterrestrial genetic interference. Despite conventional scientific theoryregarding the origin of species, there is still no real proof as to how we gothere in the first place. Moreover, the great Darwinian missing link is still,quite frankly, missing. So what scientists are doing, in all reality, is simplyindulging in exponential leaps of faith to account for this missing information.In a sense, science is creating a mythology of its very own in that it uses thehuman imagination to fill in the gaps in the theorized sequence of humanascendancy from primates into higher levels of sapiens. Even the similaritiesthat we once thought existed between the DNA of apes and humans has beendramatically reduced due to more recent studies, wherein the once 95 percentsimilarity has been reduced to a woeful 67 percent and even lower, depending onthe study. While the evidence is only circumstantial, it is beginning to look asthough the link to primates is becoming less and less an active, provable theoryon the genetic level. So let’s engage in a little gap-filling exercise of ourown: the so-called missing link may very well have been DNA provided by visitorsfrom another world.THE SERPENT IN THE GARDENDespite its ostensibly religious nature and purpose, the biblical account ofcreation and the first family actually presents a thinly veiled subtext of somekind of interruption in the human bloodline. This happens almost at the verybeginning, with the first human off-spring, one generation out from the dawn ofhumanity. A non-human character enters the picture and helps to move the plotforward to its inevitable tragic denouement. This character—an alien in theGarden of Eden who disrupts the serenity of paradise—will forever be known asthe Serpent, the seducer of the first mother and, as we shall soon see, thefather of an alien seed that perpetuates generations of mixed blood.Recall the tale of the actual temptation. As the mother of all humanity, Eveseems to be the first cause—the primum movens—of the Fall, thus breeding into usall a sinful nature that puts us all in need of a redeemer. But Eve’s downfallcomes as a result of her encounter with a serpent. To the alert reader of thispassage, the subtext is that she had intercourse with the creature. Have youever encountered a serpent that walked upright? That spoke like a person? Thesnake that Eve encounters does both of these things. Assuming that Eve knew thedifference between a snake and a man, this snake was neither:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God hadmade. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any treein the garden?’” (Genesis 3:1)The Hebrew word used in the Book of Genesis for the word snake is nachash(pronounced naw-kawsh), meaning “magician, enchanter; a spellbinder; toilluminate, shine.” Interestingly, rabbinic interpretation never posits thiscreature as a literal snake. Nachash is understood as a shining being with thepower to enchant.4 In verse 17 of the same chapter, God curses Nachash, saying:“Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdomby reason of thy brightness….” In many interpretations this cursed being is noneother than Lucifer himself, although the passage never actually uses that name;rather, the reader is forced to extrapolate the connection by referring toother, later biblical texts, such as the writings of Daniel and the Book ofRevelation. It is this being that influences (or more accurately, beguiles) Eveinto disobeying God and eating the fruit of the forbidden tree:2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middleof the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” (Genesis 3:2–3)The Hebrew word used here for tree is ets, a word that is linguistically linkedto the Hebrew word toledah (both meaning “generations”). It is from these wordsthat we draw the modern conception of the family tree. Another variation of theword is “the wood of a tree, as an opening and closing of a door.” Using somelinguistic maneuvering and extrapolation, the same word can also mean “portal;opening of one’s mind; enlightenment.” For these reasons, it is often suggestedthat the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was not a literal tree at all,but a symbol of the pre-Adamic races that lived in the regions surrounding theGarden of Eden. (Some assert that these races were what made up the Atlanteancivilization, but that is outside the scope of this essay.) The phrase “fruit ofthe tree” is actually derived from the Hebrew word periy, meaning “fruit:produce of the ground; offspring, children, progeny (of the womb); orfiguratively: fruit (of actions).” The phrase “eat of it” is the Hebrew word‘akal (pronounced aw-kal), which is often used to refer to sexual intercourse.And the word “touch” is the Hebrew word naga (naw-gah), which is also sometimesused as a euphemism for sex. Clearly this was no ordinary tree!Keeping all of this in mind, let’s take a look at the next part of the passage:4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.5 “For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you willbe like God, knowing good and evil.” 6 When the woman saw that the fruit of thetree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gainingwisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who waswith her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and theyrealized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coveringsfor themselves. (Genesis 3:5–7)The admittedly controversial definitions of the Hebrew words I am using in thispassage are driven by the context in which they appear. While the individualwords used do not necessarily have overt sexual meanings, most biblical scholarstoday agree that the context of the passage clearly points to acts of a sexualnature. Here are a few more words and phrases from the passage, along with theiralternate definitions:• The phrase “pleasant to the eyes” is the Hebrew word chamad, meaning “todesire, to covet, to take pleasure in, to delight in, to be desirable, todelight greatly, to desire greatly, desirableness, preciousness.”• The word “desired” is the Hebrew word ta’avah (tah-avaw), meaning “to yearnfor; to lust after (used of bodily appetites); a longing; by implication: adelight (subjectively, satisfaction; objectively, a charm): a desire, a wish,longings of one’s heart; lust, an appetite, covetousness (in a bad sense); tocovet; to wait longingly.”• The Hebrew word for “took” is laqach (law-kakh’). It is a primitive rootmeaning “to take (in the widest variety of applications): to take, to lay holdof, to receive, to marry, to take a wife, to take to or for a person, toprocure, to get, to take possession of, to select, to choose, to take inmarriage, to receive, to accept.”Given the multiple semantic layers available to the reader, a very differentpicture of Eve’s temptation in the Garden of Eden is beginning to emerge. Theparsed passage reveals much more than a disobedient appreciation of fruit! Allof the references we hear of Eve eating an apple, all the depictions inreligious art of the couple holding or eating a rather large piece of fruit, allof this is merely coded euphemism for the shocking truth of what the passage isreally describing. What really happens in this scene in the Garden of Eden isthat Eve, the mother of humanity, loses her virginity to the Serpent (it isevident from the passage that this occurs before she ever has sex with herhusband). Further on, it is implicit that Eve is impregnated by this encounter,and when she draws her husband into the scenario and he willingly “partakes,”she is also impregnated by him. Eve is now bearing the fraternal twins, Cain andAbel, one from the seed of Adam and the other from the seed of the characterknown as the Serpent! And so, the grand sin that is committed in Eden is notmere disobedience in the eating of a forbidden piece of fruit from a forbiddentree; it is a lurid sexual sin that creates dual bloodlines in the twinsconceived in Eve’s womb—lineages that would be in constant conflict with oneanother, starting, of course, with Cain’s murder of his twin brother.ALIEN INTERRUPTIONThe Sumerian culture of ancient Mesopotamia is the oldest human civilizationknown to contemporary science and the archaeological record. The sudden (atleast in historical terms) onset of this civilized culture has remained amystery for many years; clearly, it represented an exponential quantum leap inhumanity’s intellectual development. As Carl Sagan once remarked, we still haveno clear perspective about its origins: “Their language is foreign; it shows noresemblance to Indo-European, Semitic or any other language. We can only mapthem by the actions of their successors, the Akkadians, who created a voluminousSumerian-Akkadian dictionary.”5It all began about 6,000 years ago when the very first cuneiform writing wasdeveloped by the Sumerians to record a dramatic astronomical event—what waslikely the creation of Vela X, a star that turned into a supernova about 1,300light years away from our solar system, and which can still be seen today as afaintly flashing pulsar. Virtually overnight—in evolutionary terms, at least—theSumerians gave the world written language, the first fundamental character ofwhich was the Sumerian symbol for the word “star,” commemorating theastronomical event. The cuneiform word was then linked to the symbol for“deity,” and the term “star god” was born.In the ruined mounds of their ancient cities, the ancient Sumerians left behindcuneiform tablets that listed everything from various forms of worship tomundane business receipts drawn up between merchants. They gave us the firstlove song, the first pharmaceutical prescription (all without any inclusion ofmagic or spirituality), the first school system, the first code ofjurisprudence, and the first parliament. And we are to believe that this allcame out of nowhere, in the twinkling of a bursting supernova? Is it anycoincidence that it was during this very same period that Berossus, theBabylonian high priest, wrote of the coming of the half-fish, half-human Oannes,the beast with reason who appeared in their midst and taught the Sumeriansletters, sciences, and every kind of art—everything that would essentiallycivilize them?Cain, the twin brother of Abel, was fathered by the reptilian serpent in theGarden of Eden. This event was recorded in religious mythology as the Fall atthe hands of Eve’s temptation and “eating of the forbidden fruit.” Cain murderedhis twin brother in accordance with the “enmity” that was set between the twinsiblings, and after being banished by God from the region of Eden, wandered intoNod, in the region just east of Eden. There he built a city which became knownthroughout history as Uruk, the “first city.” Cain did not encounter any otherpeople; Cain was “the other people,” and it is clear that he bequeathed to theinhabitants of Sumer a connection to the reptiles from the sea and the dragonsfrom the sky. Humankind was indeed genetically altered by alien intelligences,and we have the SumerAkkadian cuneiform texts left as a remnant of those eventsthat so altered the course of human evolution. The question still remains,however, as to whether they are still visiting to this day. I’ll leave that foryou to decide.NOTES1 [ch09.html#ch09not1a].

Terrified of a world they did not understand and could not control,our ancestors devised these myths to bring order and predictability to achaotic, primeval world. Such are the viewpoints and conclusions of Academia.But there is much more to these stories. This simplistic conception of anignorant and credulous human race with no concept of reality is currently in itsfinal death throes. Through archaeology, we are coming to understand that theancients were actually highly advanced and may have possessed technologiescomparable to or even surpassing our own. The ancients were excellent recordkeepers, and had a significant knowledge of astronomy, medicine, andengineering. Thus it seems that we ought to take seriously these seeminglyextraordinary tales of titans, frost-giants, and cyclopes. The ancients knewwhat they were talking about.The underlying truth of this omnipresent mythos of giants goes beyond mereancient record-keeping, however. In order to establish that the giants ofantiquity were not the product of the primitive imagination, it is necessary tofirst establish as fact the feats and wisdom of the ancients. This inevitablyleads to a discussion of their pre-modern technological achievements, some farmore advanced than even our own today. Once this is established, the giantsissue can be addressed more objectively. What we have found is that thecivilizations of the ancient world were far more advanced than mostarchaeologists are prepared to admit.A deceptively small device found in 1900 on the small island of Antikythera, 25miles northwest of Crete, has helped lend credence to this assertion. Retrievedfrom the submerged wreckage of a Greek galley by fisherman and sponge divers,the device was actually a working computer, intricately devised not by Apple orDell, but by the Greeks during Hellenistic times. David Childress, author ofTechnologies of the Gods, rightfully boasts of its discovery as being“tantamount to finding a jet airplane in the tomb of King Tut.” Hints of othertechnological feats from antiquity have survived into the 21st century, as well.For example, texts and detailed drawings of flying craft called vimana in theSanskrit writings of India give us at least some indication that in the remotepast, someone—or something—was flying in the skies over our planet. Confuciusalso records that in China, during the reign of the Five Monarchs, from 2852 to2206 BCE, there were “flying carriages” (Childress 2000). It is difficult to saywith certainty what technological wonders the ancient Chinese possessed becauseprior to his death, Emperor Chin Shih Huang Ti ordered the burning of hundredsof thousands of books, including all those in the royal libraries; only a fewlucky tomes escaped the wrath of the Imperial torches. The secrets containedwithin the others are now forever lost (Ibid.) Based on these few examplesalone, it is clear that our ancestors did, in fact, possess the sameintelligence, logic, and rationality as more modern “advanced” cultures, whichin my opinion makes it highly probable that there is some truth behind theselegends.MYTH AS REMEMBRANCESince the time they walked on earth many eons ago, giants have become a part ofour collective unconscious, a terrifying Jungian archetype that captivates theimagination. Giants have become the cornerstone of the myths, legends, andtraditions of almost every culture on earth; in many cases, these narrativeshave continued, unabated and unchanged, for millennia. Such myths often depict acivilization ruled by giants that is destroyed by a global deluge and eventuallyforgotten. Only myth and legend now survive to help us decode the secrets ofthat forgotten chapter in human history. As with all mythological accounts,however, these are but blurred images of a far more profound reality. Indeed,these gigantic inhabitants of our imagination are not mere figments, but ratherthe cultural “residue” from our past experiences as a species. They are, infact, imprints or echoes of a remote but very real dark age that we have longsince forgotten—until now.For example, Inca myth describes the Ayar-aucca race, which includes four twingiants who hold up the sky. In this myth (as in many others like it), the humanrace becomes unruly and ungrateful. Angered by this neglect, the four giantsagree to let the sky tumble down and crash into the sea. The result is a globalflood that obliterates much of humankind (Joseph 2005). The idea of the skycrashing to the earth and destroying virtually all of civilization resonateswith Plato’s Atlantis and some of the more recent speculation regarding itsdemise. Some theories suggest that a comet or asteroid may have impacted Earthsometime during our remote history, causing the destruction of these ancient andadvanced cultures.In Irish mythology, we learn of the Formorach, a giant sea people whose leader,Balor, guides them to the shores of Ireland following the great flood. They thenbecome the native inhabitants of that island. While some scholars locate theFormorach’s point of origin in Spain or North Africa, others claim that theoriginal homeland of these pre-Celtic giants was Atlantis, thought to have beenlocated 200 miles west of Gibraltar (Joseph 2005).The natives of the Fijian islands believe that their ancestral land, calledBurotu, sank long ago into the Pacific Ocean. This ancestral realm wasobliterated when the “heavens fell down,” and fire and water melded together toproduce the islands of Samoa (Joseph 2005). The survivors, known as the Hiti,were thought to be a race of giants, the children of Atlantis. They built amonumental arch standing almost 20 feet high.Arab myth describes a race of giants known as the Adites. These beings are theequivalent of the Atlantean Titans of Greek mythology, and are described assuperior architects and builders. Since their earliest recorded history, Arabsin the Middle East have associated all immense structures with these greatgiants of antiquity.In a Hittite narrative, a giant originating from the Western Ocean named Kumarbiplaces the world on his mountainous neck, thereby becoming the Anatolianequivalent of the Greek deity and Titan Atlas, the founder of the mightyAtlantean empire (Joseph 2005).Bochica is a figure in the myths of the Chibcha peoples of what is present-dayColumbia. A bearded, white-skinned giant similar to Atlas, he supports the skyon his shoulders. When humankind forsakes his teachings, he eventually drops thesky, causing a series of floods and conflagrations that decimate the planet.This event also destroys the giant’s own home, forcing his children to flee andseek shelter elsewhere. In the end, they settle along the coast of Columbia,eventually becoming the country’s native Indian inhabitants (Joseph 2005).As you can see from this small sampling, the sheer number and variety of giantmyths and legends is staggering; indeed, they can be found in almost everyculture on earth. Many of these mythologies include beings closely related tothe Titans, who supposedly once ruled Atlantis. And of course there is also therecurring narrative of a great cataclysm that eventually destroys a lostcivilization sometime in the remote past. Such common themes and motifs set aprecedent for an even broader discussion.GIANTS IN HINDUISMIn the Sanskrit writings of India, we learn of the Daitya, or the water giants.They are mentioned in the Vishnu Purana and the Mahabharata, two of the mostancient and highly revered of Hindu sacred texts. The Daitya are the offspringof Vishnu. These water giants are the East Indian equivalent of the Titans ofGreek mythology, which includes Atlas and the other kings of Atlantis (Joseph2005). These writings describe how Vishnu’s mother conquers the earth for thegods and becomes the first of the mighty Daitya. This ultimately makes her theupholder of the sky—what Frank Joseph describes as “the moral order of thecosmos”—therefore identifying her with the Greek Titan Atlas, who creates theisland of Atlantis and literally bears the burden of the world upon hisshoulders (Joseph 2005).According to the Vishnu Purana, these water giants reside in Tripura, the TripleCity. This now sunken island metropolis, located far across the impenetrableWestern Ocean, echoes Plato’s own descriptions of the lost civilization ofAtlantis. The immortal Greek philosopher wrote that this submerged land mass wasbeyond the Pillars of Hercules in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The TripleCity of the Vishnu Purana is clearly emblematic of the trident of Poseidon, thepatron god of Atlantis. In a final war both the Daitya and Tripura aredestroyed, yet another similarity to myth of Atlantis (Joseph 2005).ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLOGYThe Greeks had their own giants, the Gigantes—grotesque, humanoid creatures withsnake-like legs. In the myth narratives, they attempt to overthrow Zeus and theother gods of Mt. Olympus, but ultimately fail. The Greek saga The Argonauticadescribes the giants in the following manner: “Their bodies have three pairs ofnerved hands, like paws. The first pair hangs from their gnarled shoulders, thesecond and third pairs nestle up against their misbegotten hips….” (quoted invon Däniken 2010). The earliest known Greek deities, the Titans, rules theprimordial universe before the coming of the Olympians. This parallels theBiblical Nephilim, who ruled the Earth until their age ends and gives way to therise of the human race. Atlas, perhaps the most well-known of the Titans, wasthe ruler of Atlantis and, as Frank Joseph noted in The Atlantis Encyclopedia(2005), the founder of astrology and astronomy. Atlas is often depicted inillustrations as a gigantic, bearded man crouching on one knee and bearing thesphere of the heavens upon his massive shoulders. Such imagery has come tosignify the Atlanteans’ stalwart dedication to celestial and planetary sciences.Perhaps not surprisingly, the Sanskrit word atl means “to support or uphold”(Joseph 2005). Interestingly enough, Atlas is also the name of a mountain inAsia Minor not far from the incredible ruins of Çatal-Hüyük, perhaps the oldestcity on earth (Joseph 2005) It is more than 9,000 years old, and dates back tothe destruction of Atlantis, perhaps even to the very first colony of itsfleeing survivors (Joseph 2005).The Gigantomachy recounts the battle between the giants and their mainopponents, the Olympian gods. This is perhaps the most widely depicted strugglein Greek art and literary tradition. In it, the Giants bombard the gods withboulders and the flaming trunks of burning trees. According to the oracle, thegods themselves will be unable to destroy the Giants unless a powerful mortalaids them. Of course, in ancient Greece this could be only one individual, thelegendary Heracles (Sacks 1995: 92).The Gigantes are not the only large beings in Greek mythology. The godsthemselves are also giants. Unlike the Gigantes, however, they are blond-haired,fair-skinned, and distinctly Nordic in appearance. This is consistent with thefact that Caucasians (some of whom were depicted as giants in contemporaneousreports) were once dominant and prevalent in areas long thought to be the soledomain of non-European peoples (Sacks 1995: 92).THE NORSE DEITIES AND THE GIANTSThe Germanic peoples have a rich mythological tradition filled with supernaturalcreatures, gods, trolls, elves, half-gods, and, of course, giants. As such, manyparallels can be drawn between Teutonic myths and legends and those of othercultures. Take, for example, the striking similarities between the Norse godOdin, and Olle, the tribal god of North America’s Tuleyone Indians. Like Odin,Olle is a colossal giant with a horned helmet who is both a god of war and asavior. Olle rescues their people from a fiery demon named Sahte (Joseph 2005).The Norse god Thor is, of course, one of mythology’s greatest warriors againstthe enemies of humanity—the dwarves, dragons, monsters, and, yes, other giants.The German scholar Herbert Kuhn has traced Thor back to perhaps the darkestchapter in human history, the Old Stone Age, when hunter-gatherers living incaves dominated Northern Europe. Thor’s weapon of choice is the hammer, which,according to Kuhn, means “stone,” and is the basis for a new theory linking theIron Age god Thor to the Stone Age. In Sanskrit he is called Tanayitnu, meaning“the thunderer” (von Däniken 1970).The sagas tell us of the earliest beliefs and cosmologies of the ancient Norseand other Germanic peoples of northwestern Europe. We have visions of the frostgiants and Jotnar. According to the Eddas, one of these ancient collections ofNorse stories, there are two races of giants: the children of Thrud, who descendfrom the frost giant Ymir; and the children of Bor, who include the Aesir.Though tremendous in size, the Aesir are distinctly Nordic in appearance. Forreasons unknown, the giants battle in a protracted, seemingly interminableconflict. Finally, Odin, Vili, and Ve, the first Aesir, ambush Ymir and murderhim. When they slit his throat, in yet another allusion to the great flood, agreat deluge of blood rushes forth and drowns most of the giants. Some escape ina boat to a new realm called Jotunheim. The world as we know it, Midgard, isformed from the body of Ymir. His salty, watery blood then becomes the oceans,rivers, and lakes; his flesh becomes the earth; his bones, the rocks andmountains; his hair, the forests; and the maggots from inside his stomach, thedwarves. But it was the later descriptions of Aryan warriors and battles betweengiants that became most deeply engrained in the sensibilities of these Westerncultures, and which actually had some foundation in reality.GIGANTOPITHECUS: THE ORIGINAL KING KONGEvolutionary biologists have identified a giant humanoid race that they callGigantopithecus blacki. This early hominid stood some 9.5 feet tall. Somebelieve that this creature may have been the ancestor of the Yeti, or Bigfoot.This colossal, manlike ape, which ruled the forests of East Asia and other partsof the world for about a million years, has been extinct for the past 100,000years. The species coexisted with our immediate predecessor, Homo erectus,before our own species, Homo sapiens, made its inevitable appearance. Perhaps,it is argued, our prehistoric ancestors experienced firsthand the awesome powerof Gigantopithecus and passed down the knowledge of this being through a kind ofarchetype or collective memory. Perhaps our notion of Bigfoot is just one partof such a collective experience. What we know of Gigantopithecus comes from thediscovery of more than 1,000 fossilized teeth found in numerous areas throughoutSoutheast Asia, as well as from a reconstruction performed by the Dutchpaleontologist and geologist Dr. Ralph von Koenigswald. He initially discoveredthe giant molars in 1934 southern China. The Chinese, overlooking them asvaluable pieces to our evolutionary puzzle, were selling the teeth (which theycalled “dragon bones”) as cures for various illnesses. After World War II brokeout in Europe in September of 1939, local Japanese authorities eventuallyarrested Koenigswald as an enemy alien, thus ending his research. He wasliberated in 1945, but much of his research was destroyed in the ensuingconflict.GIANTS IN THE BIBLEFrom the myths and tribal folklore of primitive aborigines to the hallowedscriptures of our modern-day churches, temples, and mosques, the archetype ofthe giant is inescapable. The Bible is one of our earliest and most widely readresources for understanding these myths. The Book of Job is considered theoldest book in the Hebrew Bible. Job 26:5–6 reveals: “The Primeval giantstremble imprisoned beneath the waters with their inhabitants. The unseen world[the bottom of the sea] lies open before them, and the place of destruction isuncovered” (quoted in Joseph 2005). Author Frank Joseph links this descriptionto an early reference to Atlantis. The giants here could be construed as theoriginal children of Atlantis, just as the founding fathers of Atlantis were agiant super-race known as the Titans, an earlier population of enormous godsthat once ruled the primordial universe.In Genesis 6:4 we read, “There were giants in the earth in those days; and alsoafter that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and theybare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men ofrenown” (King James Version). This particular verse from the Old Testament isactually one of most enduring controversies of modern Biblical scholarship. Theterm giants is actually a mistranslation of the Hebrew word nephilim, which isderived from the Hebrew verb nafol, meaning “to fall.” Thus, the Nephilim areoften conceived of as a fallen race of giants who ruled the world prior to thegreat flood, the global deluge that engulfed the antediluvian world and finallyended their reign. The descendants of the Nephilim are known as the Emin, whoare described in the King James Bible as “a people greater, and many, and tall.”These descendants of the Nephilim were also the inheritors of the antediluvianreligious practices and rites that were enacted atop Seir, the sacred mountain(Joseph 2005). For many, this whole matter remains an enigma that has provokedrampant speculation. Some claim that the Nephilim were actually greys (aliens),while others contend that the mysterious figures were actually the Neanderthalsof Ice Age Europe and the Near East.One can also find evidence for the presence of a gigantic ruling class of godson earth in the Torah. As Zecharia Sitchin points out in his book, There WereGiants Upon the Earth, “It does not speak of the sons of God, but uses the termthe Bnei Ha Elohim—‘the sons of the Elohim,’ a plural term taken to mean ‘gods’but literally meaning ‘lofty ones’” (Sitchin 2010). Thus even the oldest of theHoly Scriptures tell us of a vanished age in which both giants and gods, alongwith other fantastic and supernatural creatures, inhabited and ruled the earth.The story of the flood itself gives us an inkling of what life here on Earth mayhave been like before the global deluge. The Book of Genesis gives us only briefglimpses of that alternative world history, and so contrasts drastically withthe non-Biblical, evolutionary view of history now maintained as the establishedparadigm. The non-evolutionary world history, in contrast, is explored furtherand in much greater detail in the apocryphal works known as the Book of Enochand the Book of Giants, two books only recently rediscovered that were notofficially canonized as part of the Bible. The Book of Giants is actually aportion of the Book of Enoch that was unknown until the mid-20th century, whenexcavations at the Qumran caves on the Dead Sea counted them among the Dead SeaScrolls. This rich treasure-trove consists of a collection of dozens of scrollsand hundreds of fragments. They helped provide insight into Old Testamentwritings and the relatively new religion of Christianity. The Book of Giantsdescribes the antediluvian world as follows: “[These fallen angels] knew thesecrets of [all things]. [At this time] sin was great on the earth. The wickedangels killed many people and begot giants [with mortal women].” These passagesare echoed in the remaining portions of the Book. Likewise, in Enoch 7:3–6, thedaughters of menbecame pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousandells [a Germanic form of measurement approximating the length of one man’s arm]:who summoned all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustainthem, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sinagainst birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’sflesh, and drink their blood. Then the earth laid accusation against the lawlessones.According to Enoch at least, it was this course of events that precipitated thegreat flood.THE GIANTS WHO TRAVELED EASTIn their book Uriel’s Machine, Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas attempt todemonstrate that the Watchers, a race of fallen angels—the Nephilim—who matedwith mortal women and produced the giants who came to rule the antediluvianworld, were in fact members of the Grooved Ware culture, so named after thegrooved markings found on their surviving pottery. Some researchers theorizethat this culture was also the progenitor of both the Celtic and Germanicpeoples of Western Europe. In the Book of Enoch, the Watchers and theiroffspring implore Enoch to represent them: “All the giants [and monsters] grewafraid and called Mahway. He came to them and the giants pleaded with him andsent him to Enoch [to speak on their behalf]” (quoted in Knight and Lomas 1999,p. 302). They then beg the god of Newgrange to spare them and the world from thecomet about to strike and bring about the mighty deluge. The god responds: “Allthe mystery had not yet been revealed to you…. You have no peace… behold,destruction is coming, a great flood, and it will destroy all” (Ibid.). Knightand Lomas believed that the Grooved Ware culture—the giants of Biblicalfame—knew of the coming catastrophe and felt that they would find safety andsalvation only in the Tarim Basin, a high plateau guarded by the mountain rangesof Tibet and Mongolia. What they didn’t know, however, was that this mystery wasabout to be unraveled.A series of Chinese archaeological excavations in the late 1980s revealedhundreds of mummies along the Western border of China. These unique humanremains exhibit clear Caucasian traits. Other ancient corpses in Mongolia,Siberia, and Central Asia were also discovered displaying the same Europeancharacteristics. While a fair number of these mummies date back to at least 3500BCE, others have been determined to be even older, dating to around 4000–5000BCE. In addition to having European features, they wore Western-style clothing,including plaid twill and the world’s earliest known pair of pants. Later,carbon-14 dating provided perhaps the best estimate of the mummies’ originalage, placing them at 3,500 years before the birth of the Han civilization.Evidence suggests that they are related to an Indo-European–speaking group ofCaucasians known as the Tocharians (Baumer 28). These prehistoric Chineseremains were unknown to much of the outside world until a security breach led tothe announcement of the discoveries in 1994. When they heard about this, Knightand Lomas made an interesting argument. One of the taller mummies, known asChechen Man (also called the Ur-David), is about 6.5 feet tall. Some of themummies are even taller. To the Asians who first recorded their encounters withthese yellow-haired barbarians, asserted Knight and Lomas, they truly must haveseemed like giants. These Tarim Mummies, with their large builds andabove-average heights, may have contributed or given rise to some of the rumorsof giants and strange, yellow-haired peoples. They did not, however, explainaway ancient accounts of monstrous and imposing beings that possessednear-supernatural or even extraterrestrial strengths and abilities.THE REPHAIM, THE LAND OF CANAAN, AND GOLIATHOn the Website Giantsinthebible.com, author Peter Chattaway presents a completeinventory of the giant myth as they are described in the Bible. In addition tothe ominous Nephilim, Chattaway writes, is a vigorous race of giants known asthe Rephaim. The first mention of them appears in Genesis 14:5: “And in thefourteenth year came Kedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smotethe Rephaim in Ashtoreth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham and the Emin in ShavehKiriathaim.” This vastly superior force, led by an alliance of kings, chiefamong them being Kedorlaomer of Elam, crushed every people they encountered andbrutally defeated the Rephaim (Chattaway 1994). The main focus of the king’sexpedition was to sack and gain control of Sodom and Gomorrah. Again, accordingto Genesis 14:10:the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remainedfled to the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and alltheir victuals, and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son,who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.Chattaway also notes that throughout this earliest account, there is noindication that the armies that Kedorlaomer of Elam and his defeated alliance ofkings were actually giants. At this point, the Rephaim are portrayed simply asjust another one of the many tribes and nations that comprised Canaan and thesurrounding territories. But later, when Moses is confronted with the samepeoples in Deuteronomy, the description of them is more vivid. When Mosesaddresses the Israelites on the eve of their invasion of Canaan, he explainsthat they may not invade the land of the Moabites and Ammonites because thoselands had been promised to the descendants of Lot, who, he reminds them, hadbeen liberated from evil forces. These forces were a race of giants, the samepeople who were defeated and called the Rephaim by the alliance of the kingsdescribed back in Genesis. This task was attributed to the God Yahweh, and wasbut a prelude to future events.Of course, while the exploits in the Book of Enoch are certainly fascinating,most people are familiar with the confrontation between David and Goliath, thebest-known giant of the Bible who was masterfully slain by the humble shepherdand future king. In II Samuel 21:20, we read that David engaged in battle withmighty giants. Not only did they tower above the Hebrew soldiers, but they hadextra fingers, as well. In his book Twilight of the Gods, author Erich vonDäniken devotes several pages to the various Biblical accounts of ancientgiants. He describes this battle in some detail, and explains more fully theawesome size and power of Goliath and his fellow giants. For example, in thefifth book of the Pentateuch the narrative speaks of a gigantic sarcophagus:For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, hisbedstead was a bedstead of iron; it is not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?Nine cubits was the length of it [about 8.5 feet], and four cubits the breadthof it, after the cubit of a man (Deuteronomy 3:11).The Bible also describes what is perhaps the most famous giant encounter of all:And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath,whose height was six cubits and a span…and he was armed with a coat of mail; andthe weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and the staff of hisspear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekelsof iron (Samuel 7:1–4).Goliath was the direct descendant of King Og of the Ammonites. I Chronicles 20:3–8 gives a description of Goliath’s lineage and how he came to confront David:And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and withharrows of iron and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of thechildren of Ammon. And David and all the people return to Jerusalem. And it cameto pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines at whichtime Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of thegiant: and they were subdued. And there was war again with the Philistines; andElhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite whosespear staff was like a weaver’s beam. And yet again there was war at Gath wherewas a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six oneach hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giants. But whenhe defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. Thesewere born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by thehand of his servants.To this day, the Bible offers us some of the most compelling evidence that atone time, giants once existed on this planet—what I call the “race of giants”hypothesis. Biblical sources provide scholars with some of the most culturallyand religiously significant accounts of giants available in all the European andNear Eastern traditions. However, there are other accounts that are linked notto the Judaeo-Christian world, but rather to the diverse cultures of the NewWorld.GIANTS IN THE NEW WORLDIn even the earliest written accounts of almost every culture there can be founddescriptions of fierce, light-skinned peoples who were once the central force ofa lost civilization. Science writer Terrence Aym described the following seriesof events in two unpublished articles dealing with the presence of giants inancient America. He also described some of the encounters between Europeanexplorers and various gigantic Caucasian aborigines in Central and SouthAmerica.The Paiute tribe of present-day Nevada tells of an ancient war they wagedagainst a primordial race of white-skinned, red-haired giants. The Paiute calledthese imposing Caucasians the Si-Te-Cah. This name refers to the tule, a fibrousplant that the giants used to construct assault rafts. According to tribal lore,this race was already living in North America when the ancestors of the Paiutearrived 15,000 years previously. The modern scientific dogmatism dismisses thesereports as sheer fantasy, but there has to be more to it than just a case ofoveractive imaginations.Physical remains of giant-sized Caucasian peoples have been found on almostevery continent. In the United States, hundreds of sites have been excavated,including those in Virginia, New York State, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee,Arizona, and Nevada. Hard scientific evidence supporting the Paiute account of awar with gigantic red-haired Caucasians first came to light in 1924 at LovelockCaves in Nevada. During prehistoric times, a massive freshwater lake called LakeLahontan covered the region. It was underneath this vast body of water that theoriginal cavern was positioned, and remained underwater until the lakeeventually dried up over time. According to the Paiute, the giants practicedcannibalism, much in the same way early Neanderthals did. Indeed, Neanderthalcampsite remains include human bones with artificial cut-marks on them. ThePaiute claim they were as tall as 12 feet in height, but these may have beenexaggerations of a naturally tall Caucasoid race, corresponding to the Nordicheight.According to myth, the Paiute pursued the giants into a cave. There the giantsfound sanctuary and continued to resist the tribe, ignoring their demands toexit the cave and face the tribe head-on. The enraged tribesman covered the cavewith brush and ignited it into flames, hoping this would force the giants out ofthe cave. The small number of the stalwart giants who ran out of the caveentrance were immediately pummeled by a barrage of arrows. Those who remained inthe cave were overcome by the intense fumes and perished.In 1911, skeletons and fossils were found in the area dating to the time of thelegend’s origin. More than 10,000 artifacts were unearthed including themummified remains of two red-haired giants. One of them was a female, 6.5 feettall, and the other a male that towered over 8 feet tall. These relics provedonce and for all that the Paiute myth of a war against a race of giants was notfantasy, but a stark and horrifying reality. Evidence in the form of brokenarrows that had been shot into the cave and a dark layer of burned materialsupports the description of the climactic battle scene that concludes thelegend. Two very large skeletons were then unearthed in the Humboldt dry lakebednear Lovelock, Nevada. Among the human remains was one skeleton, wrapped in agum-covered cloth not unlike those found in Egyptian mummifications andmeasuring some 8.5 feet tall. The other was an astounding 10 feet tall.The Book of Mormon, which also speaks of giants, calls these originalinhabitants the Jaredites, often considered to be the Olmec of Central America,but it is more likely that the Olmec were just a single part of a much morewidely distributed population. In Ether 15:26, the Mormon scriptures claim thatthey were “large and mighty men as to the strength of men.” The 16th-centurychronicler Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl wrote:In this land called New Spain there were giants, as demonstrated by their bonesthat have been discovered in many areas. The ancient Toltec record keepersreferred to the giants as Quinametzin; and as they had a record of the historyof the Quinametzin they learned that they had many wars and dissensions amongthemselves in this land that is now called New Spain. They were destroyed, andtheir civilization came to an end as a result of great calamities and as apunishment from the heavens for graves [sic] sins that they had committed(Allen, 124).I believe that a real race of red-haired giants dominated the Americas at onetime, perhaps tens of thousands of years before the arrival of the ancestors oftoday’s Native Americans across the Bering Strait some 13,000–15,000 years ago.In defense of this admittedly controversial statement, I will say that race is amutable thing, and that the physical appearance of New World humans during theIce Age may have been quite different; perhaps they were part of a line thatleft no known descendants. By the same token, the presence of a forgottenCaucasian population in Asia that could have walked across Berengia with theother Asiatics is also a possibility. This would best explain some of theunusual results from recent genetic testing, which has actually confirmed thepresence of Caucasoid genes in some of the existing ancient remains.Western European explorers such as Magellan, Sir Francis Drake, Desoto, andCommodore Byron (the famous poet Lord Byron’s grandfather) all reportedencounters with living giants—remnants of a once proud and noble race ofCaucasian “supermen”—all across the North American continent. A well-documentedsighting by Magellan occurred in 1520 near the harbor of San Julian, Mexico.There, Magellan and his crew came upon a red-haired giant that stood nearly 10feet tall and whom Magellan described as having a “voice like a bull” (Aym2011). Later, Magellan learned from normal-sized natives that the giant belongedto a neighboring tribe (Ibid.). “Remarkably,” Aym writes, “Magellan’s logs showthat he and his crew captured two of these living giants and brought them aboardship, intending to bring them back to Europe. Unfortunately, the giants grew illand they both died during the return voyage. Magellan had their remains buriedat sea” (Ibid.).Evidence of ancient giants abounds across the globe, proof of lost civilizationsand migrations which are slowly coming to light thanks to a series of chancediscoveries as well as the dutiful efforts of today’s independent-minded amateurarchaeologists and other scientists. This research has lead us into a whole newrealm of scientific investigation. Inexplicably, established academia continuesto deny their existence, so it is up to each and every one of us to challengethe prevailing paradigm—and perhaps forever change our own history in theprocess.BIBLIOGRAPHYAllen, Joseph L., and Blake Joseph Allen.

Such abelief is neither accurate nor a natural, understandable error; we have beendeliberately conditioned to ignore all evidence to the contrary. As it turnsout, we are not the product of an accidental chemical interaction in an unlikelyuniverse, nor are we the miraculous creation of a supernatural God (an ideaactually concocted by people less than 2,000 years ago): we are self-evolvingparticipants in a marvelously conscious, self-learning, and self-creatinguniverse containing many species of advanced beings (ABs).1 [ch11.html#ch11not1]An AB is a member of any species more advanced than our own, with the power andindependence to decide whether or not to interact with us. We may seek them out,but they are the ones who will control the extent and timing of that contact.ABs include the ancient astronauts I will discuss here, as well as aliens orextraterrestrials (ETs). The acronym2 [ch11.html#ch11not2] also applies to thegods described in early creation stories. It covers beings such as the Annunakiand Elohim, Vishnu and Yahweh, as well as their progeny, who are known byvarious names but are usually thought of as angels and devils. ABs also includethe invisible voices that have spoken to Hindu yogis, Moses, Mohammed, JosephSmith, and many other founders of the world’s religions. ABs also includeethereal beings such as Seth, the Pleiadians, and other self-identifiedmessengers such as spirit guides or channeled ascended masters.Although ABs are typically more advanced than humans, in some cases a humanbeing may be more moral, may know things that an AB does not know, or may havesuperior skills in a certain area. However, the very idea of ABs always createsuncertainty and fear: What are their intentions? Are they manipulating us? Canwe trust them? What do they want from us? And perhaps most importantly, oncewe’ve made contact with them, is this a permanent state of affairs? Suchquestions unnerve us because our collective memories of earlier AB-humaninteractions have been suppressed and indeed almost wiped out during the last2,000 years. Why and how did this happen? To answer this question, let’s startwith the oldest stories.HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF ABSCreation myths have been the subject of thousands of tomes, manuscripts, books,articles, and academic papers. Most of these narratives of creation describewhat can only be construed as ABs fighting amongst themselves before they insertthemselves in the birth and development of humans and their early cultures. Inthe Enuma Elish, for example, the characters Apsu and Tiamat are, in fact, ABs.Another creation myth, this one from China, describes P’an Ku, another AB whoinstructs primal humans about the universe. An Apache account tells of Hactein,who is the creator of all human beings.3 [ch11.html#ch11not3] Similar themes arefound in writings from Egypt, India, Japan, and indeed in practically everyother nation and culture around the globe. What are we to make of theuniversality of these stories? Do they refer to an actual event or events in ourhistory that etched deep images into our memory bank that have survived for250,000 years or more? Did the ABs who were involved in or knew of these“humanoid creation projects” teach these stories to Homo sapiens? Or are theysimply delusions, the anxious projections of early cultures at a time when lifewas “nasty, brutish, and short”?An brief perusal of the offerings on the Internet reveals more about scholars’beliefs than what the stories actually tell us. What they write reflects apredetermined worldview4 [ch11.html#ch11not4] that denies the existence of ABsdespite all evidence to the contrary. Such scholars disparage the very idea ofan AB history, dismissing it instead with unsubstantiated assertions, such asthat early humans made up stories of the gods because they felt powerless andafraid of the unpredictable forces of nature. Similarly, when psychiatry was inits infant stages, Freud and others explained away the “primitive” idea of a godor gods by saying that adults who were living in such a world (“nasty andbrutish”) needed to project the idea of a loving, protective father into theunknown, which provided a feeling of comfort and purpose.While many attribute the universal accounts of a god or gods creating the humanrace to a childish fantasy or to a spontaneous “short-circuiting” of falsememories in the human brain, neither psychological research nor behavioralneuroscience supports such speculations. Despite the fact that they lackrobustness as theories, however, these academic pretentions persist in themainstream. And there is no room for discourse: Anyone who even hints that thesestories might have a basis in reality is now quickly censored—and censured—bythose who do not share this view. What many of the authors of those learnedbooks and academic papers don’t understand, however, is that these myths areactually descriptions of real events when ABs descended from the skies to Earth.If science actually followed its beloved principle of Occam’s Razor—in which thesimplest answer is generally the correct one, all things being equal—the mostlikely explanation for these early AB stories is that they must be based inactual human experience. Unfortunately, most scientists accept thesepseudo-scientific hypotheses as fact and/or are unwilling to challenge thereligions that were responsible for expurgating any sign of ABs from the annalsof history in the first place. This deliberate erasing of the evidence of ABsfrom early historical accounts was accomplished via psychological conditioning,religious edict, and, when all else failed, brute force. These efforts by dozensof generations of religious leaders were facilitated by literal armies ofpolitical enforcers.Fortunately, some scientists have had the courage to investigate and evensupport the AB Intervention hypothesis. For instance, the theory of panspermia(the existence of life throughout the universe) suggests that the “seeds” oflife may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrialcivilization.5 [ch11.html#ch11not5] The fact that we’ve discovered virtuallyhundreds of planets that could support life increases the possibility that amore advanced species may have directed such “seeds” our way, or that they couldhave visited, deposited simple life forms, and then cultivated the barren Earthto support this new life. A more complex model of intervention, consistent withpre-modern human memories about ancient gods, would have the ABs arriving,establishing bases, having sporadic contact with humans, and then departing.Such a scenario could explain some of the artifacts I will be discussingshortly. This theory is consistent with human observations of ABs on Earth fromspaceships, as represented in the drawings and carvings of pre-modern peoples.However, I would like to posit a third and even more complex model. Buttressedby research from the late Zecharia Sitchin, Eric von Däniken, and others, itincludes AB genetic invasion and manipulation of Earth’s species as well as theexploitation of humans. As grim and terrifying as this sounds, the ABs alsoprovided valuable assistance in our evolution as a species.Hominids have been around for six million years. Homo erectus, still brutish butincreasingly civilized, arose less than two million years ago. Due to geneticintervention by ABs, Homo sapiens arose in Africa about 200,000 BP. Under ABcolonial rule, Homo sapiens sapiens arose by 100,000 BP, quickly branching offinto different regions and varying genotypes. With only sparse evidence from thelast 250,000 years, we must fill in the gaps as best we can and make certaininferences regarding times, places, and so forth. After the 11,500 BP globalcataclysm, however, the record is much clearer. Sophisticated cultures blossomedfrom survivors in several locations—Mesopotamia, India, the Andes, and so on.The stories that survived (some explicit, others vague) contained memories ofAB-human interaction occurring prior to the cataclysm. Some hinted of highlyevolved civilizations such as Lemuria6 [ch11.html#ch11not6] and Atlantis, orholy places such as Eden and Shambhala.The post-cataclysm stories—the tale of Noah, for example—described AB assistancethat helped humans rebuild after the catastrophe. The downside of this help, ofcourse, was continuation of the AB colonial rule first hinted at in the story ofAdam and Eve. The revival of human culture did not escape the subjugation andsense of disenfranchisement imposed by the ABs. Several survival accounts(Sumerian, Hebrew, Sanskrit, and African, for example) describe conflicts amongthe gods and with their human tribes. This warring is partly what caused the ABcolonizers to quit their overt rule of Earth prior to 4,000 BP. They left humansto their own devices or under kings and queens whose lineages were derived fromAB bloodlines. The extant lists of Egyptian rulers actually track this shift:ABs gave way to 5th-millennium hybrid kings, to be followed by the pharaohs, whoboth imitated and claimed to be descendants of the ABs/gods.The first priest-kings turned their regencies into sects in order to manipulatepeople into the continuing worship of their absentee AB forebears. This maneuveronly succeeded in stifling intellectual and social progress: multiplecivilizations descended into the age of cults, and squabbling priest-kingsperpetuated the tribal wars that humans had fought under the flags of their ABoverlords for millennia. As centuries passed without a sign of the ABsreturning, the priest-kings, with their weakening bloodlines, began to lose the“spell” they once exerted over their subjects. To continue leveraging thiscontrol over new generations, royal priests began to reframe the historicalfacts about ABs into supernatural terms, inventing the idea that the heavenlyrealm had bestowed upon them a unique and privileged advantage over the masses.Cult leaders such as the Roman popes declared that only they possessed thedivine channel to receive messages from the departed AB-gods. In this manner,supernatural religions were created to replace the AB-based cults. This sleightof hand, shifting the human focus from real ABs to false gods, kept humans underthe psychological sway of authoritarian leaders who, naturally, had their ownpolitical agendas.7 [ch11.html#ch11not7] For two millennia humans have frettedbetween this supernatural “spell” and the natural, biological impulse to realizetheir human potential. Mired in an emotional stagnation largely of our owncreation, many of us are now (perhaps with the help of input from moreenlightened ABs) working to reveal the real story behind the cover-up.EVIDENCE FOR AB INTERVENTIONThe evidence that supports the AB Intervention hypothesis is both direct andindirect. The direct evidence includes artifacts of possible extraterrestrialorigins—see the research of Michael Cremo and others—as well as eyewitnessreports of AB-related events. The indirect data corroborate postulatedtimelines, locations, and activities attributed to ABs.Eyewitness reports with varying levels of detail can be found in early textsrecorded on papyrus, copper, clay, stone, wood, and fabrics, found in situ or ofknown provenance. Later interpretations of these texts still reflect thatculture’s record of its conscious memories. This is clearly illustrated in theHebrew texts that I will describe in a moment. Sumerian, Egyptian, Hindu,Hebrew, and other records reporting observations of ABs or human interactionswith them are credible and reliable pieces of evidence. Examples include theDead Sea Scrolls,8 [ch11.html#ch11not8] the Nag Hammadi Scriptures,9[ch11.html#ch11not9] and the Gnostic Gospels.10 [ch11.html#ch11not10]Additionally, an excellent analysis prepared by Roger Voss illustrates thequality of such information found in the oldest publicly available version ofthe Paleo-Hebrew Torah.11 [ch11.html#ch11not11] Although there are earlier textsthat describe ABs interacting with humans, this version shows that about 2,000years ago, Hebrew scribes still acknowledged the AB reality. Voss citesDeuteronomy 10:17, which states, “For Yahweh your God—He is God of the Elohim,and Lord of the lords; God, the great, the mighty, and the fearful….” The namesYahweh, Lord, lords, God, and Elohim all refer to ABs. Later versions of thesetexts were rewritten to distort the facts. By the time of the Nicean Council in325 CE, which formally institutionalized Christianity, both Jewish and Christianleaders had conflated the absentee Yahweh and Elohim ABs into their notion of asingular god. Why they shifted from reality to fantasy I will reveal a bitfurther on in this essay. For now, let’s review the more indirect evidence forthe AB Intervention hypothesis: fossil records, anomalous artifacts (which canalso be considered direct evidence, depending on the item or items in question),indirect DNA corroboration, and language patterns. Each one of these exerted anexternal influence on human physical evolution and social development.The fossil record shows that our hominid ancestors slowly evolved over a timeperiod of more than six million years. They coped with harsh conditions for along time and with little genetic mutation. Yet, around 200,000 BP, in what wasto be a radical, abrupt change in the erectus pace of genetic mutation, a muchmore nimble and intelligent species (Homo sapiens) suddenly appeared in Africa.Multiple sites illustrate this rapid divergence. One is the existence oferectus-type stone hand axes and other tools found in south Africa and on Crete(an island separated from Africa for millions of years) that dated to 700,000BP. They were still in use 130,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens was alreadyestablishing far-ranging seafaring routes. Again, the genetic changes producingHomo sapiens occurred within a very short period rather than hundreds ofthousands or even millions of years. Some feel that this “gap” in humanevolution requires an extraordinary explanation. The Genesis passage citedpreviously offers one. As Voss cites from Genesis 1:26, “…the Elohim said, Letus make man in our image….” To achieve that goal would require something akin togenetic manipulation to create an entirely new species—in this case, Homosapiens.After about 100,000 years, another anomalous gap occurred in the geneticevolution of genus Homo development. Homo sapiens sapiens fossils dating fromthat period can be found in Africa and beyond. Armed with complex languageskills and tools, these modern humans demonstrated greater mental capabilitieswith no corresponding increase in brain capacity. This historical reality isconsistent with Sumerian and Hebrew texts that describe AB “upgrades” ofhumans.12 [ch11.html#ch11not12] The rabbinical scribes at the time of theBabylonian exile (6th century BCE) still accepted the historical claims thatElohim (read: the ABs) had raised humans above the other animals on Earth. AsGenesis 1:26 states, “let them have dominion over [all animals and the earth]….”Anomalous artifacts can be either indirect or direct evidence of ABIntervention. The most ubiquitous of these are the pyramidal structures that canbe found on nearly every continent. In addition to sharing the same angularshape, their positioning indicates an astral orientation. They are often alignedin the direction of fixed stars thought to be the locations of AB home bases(for example, the Pleiades). Designed by the ABs themselves for only periodicvisits, human acolytes maintained them as altars where ABs demanded worship andsacrifices. The AB-gods then enforced these obligations. Most pyramids orziggurats date from after the Cataclysm (the most obvious exception being theGreat Pyramids in Egypt), when some ABs decided to return to Earth and renderassistance to the survivors.During this period, AB interaction with humans continued. Biblical accounts ofthe gigantic progeny of ABs and humans indicated their presence during the timeof King David 3,000 years ago. The structures eventually deteriorated after thecomplete withdrawal of ABs from Earth. By the 5th century BCE, the ABs had beenabsent for a millennium or more. The Greek historian Herodotus, describing thecradle of Western civilization, reported that the ziggurats had fallen intoruin. These events and dates neatly coincide with the AB timeline alreadymentioned here.Indirect DNA corroboration of the AB Intervention hypothesis comes from morethan two decades of genetic research. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),researchers now believe that Homo sapiens sapiens came from one or a few relatedfemales in Africa less than 200,000 years ago. This date precedes the estimateddate (between 150,000 to 50,000 BP) for the arrival of Homo sapiens sapiens inEurope and Central Asia. This so-called Eve Event is consistent with the fossilrecord and the Annunaki history first publicized by Zecharia Sitchin in hisseries of books, The Earth Chronicles. No male Y-chromosome analysis to dateplaces an “Adam” coexistent with that “Eve.” This is consistent with in vivo orin vitro genetic manipulation of related female ova using multiple sperm donors.(Ancient texts indicate that the AB colonies had more males than females.)The history of blood-type genes also provides a window into AB involvement inhuman history. For instance, type-B blood appeared sometime around 11500 BP.This date is associated with the Deluge survivors in the Turkic-Mesopotamianregion (believed by some to be the site of the story of Noah’s ark). The peopleswho currently live in this region have a higher-than-average percentage oftype-B than other peoples living in adjacent areas.As far as language patterns go, stories from many cultures assert that theirancestors received their language or alphabet from the gods. This includes theEgyptians, who claimed that Thoth was the source of their language, and theHindus, who credit the Sanskrit alphabet to the AB Saraswati. It appears this ABgift of language also involved a genetic upgrade. The FOXP2 gene, which gaveHomo sapiens control over the muscles of the mouth and throat, appeared about200,000 BP, coinciding with the leap from erectus to sapiens. Insertion of thisgene could explain how ABs gave humans language skills beyond those of otherhominids.HELP FROM THE STARRY SKIESIn the biblical tale of the flood, God warned Noah of its coming beforehand. Hewas told to build a special boat (an ark) and gather his family onboard, alongwith animals to breed after the storm. The Snohomish tribe in the PacificNorthwest believe that ABs warned their ancestors to prepare canoes to ride thecoming tide to the mountaintops. More than 500 similar legends have beenidentified worldwide. Their central theme is a prior warning by ABs to preparefor survival after a widespread flood or other catastrophic event. While thissuggests a universal event, specific dates are lacking. Fortunately, dateableevidence indexed by D.S. Allan and J.B. Delair in their book Cataclysm placesthe date of a global catastrophe about 11,500 BP.13 [ch11.html#ch11not13] In it,the authors describe reports of volcanic eruptions, floods, earthquakes, therising of mountains, dark skies, the sun appearing to stand still, and more.Scattered groups of people who survived this cataclysmic horror were left withvarying levels of knowledge and resources. Civilizations that had been thousandsof years old no longer existed. For some lucky clusters of survivors, ABsreturned to selected areas on Earth and offered their assistance, just as manycountries do today after natural disasters. Sophisticated city centers began torise in Sumer between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and nearby mountainregions, along the Indus River Valley, in the Tian Shen Plateau in what is nowChina, and in the Andes region of South America. The surviving cultures becamefocused on the ABs who had helped them. This period of rebuilding and relearningunder the tutelage of the “gods of old” lasted anywhere from 5,000 to 6,000years.THE SUBJUGATION OF HUMANSThe first phase of AB intervention in the development of Homo sapiens wasimpersonal, technical gene-splicing. But, as Homo sapiens quickly evolved, bothphysically and mentally, its interactions with ABs became more personal andimmediate. Cohabitation between the AB colonizers and humans occurred duringboth the pre- and post-Cataclysm eras. Humans who labored for the ABs or hadbecome members of their households must have learned a great deal from them.That said, the exile from Eden was a turning point. Humans lost their access toAB knowledge and technologies. As Genesis 3:22 states, “And Yahweh [and the]Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now,lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, andlive forever….” The ABs realized that human mastery of their advanced knowledgewas a threat.After Eden, the most senior Annunaki/Elohim kept their distance from humans, buttheir sons (the Bene Elohim, in Hebrew) practiced miscegenation—in other words,they mixed with humans via inter-marriage, cohabitation, intercourse, andprocreation. As Voss cites from the Ethiopic Book of Enoch and Genesis 1:26,“Lamech, the father of Noah, became afraid and fled, and he did not believe thathe [Noah] was of him but of the image of the angels of heaven.” (According toall accounts, Noah had pale skin, bright eyes, and long, wooly white hair.)These progeny from Bene Elohim-human parentage were called Nephilim, meaning“demigods” or “giants” in Hebrew. Some contemporaries saw these strange giantsas undesirable rejects from both AB and human societies, but the prevailing viewwas that they were part of a royal bloodline. After the AB abdication of directrule (which occurred about 4,000 or 5,000 years ago), these royal half-breedsassumed control over the former AB kingdoms in what is now known as the cradleof Western civilization.Given the present body of evidence, we have no choice but to see ourselves as ahybrid species. While this fact was well-known by humans at the dawn of modernhistory, the knowledge was then distorted by the ruler-priests—who becamepharaohs, popes, and the like—who took advantage of those who were ignorant,psychologically manipulating them to serve their own economic and politicalagendas. Unaware of our real history, most of us unwittingly see thesekings/priests as our benefactors.ABS AS COLONIZERSThis kind of close engagement between two species involves advantages anddisadvantages for both parties, some with long-term implications. For thisreason, at this point in time we cannot see all the pros and cons of the ABintervention in our own evolution. However, a review of European colonization oflesser developed societies during the past five centuries offers insight intosome long-term effects of the Elohim/Annunaki on the plight of modern humans.Their interference in the natural process of human evolution (which includedhybridization) left us prone to and easily manipulated by existential fears. TheAB legacy, continued by their hybrid descendants, caused psychological damageseveral orders of magnitude worse than what was wrought by any European colonialregime. Admittedly, this genetic intervention (upgrading hominids to Homosapiens) and technical assistance accelerated our physical evolution, but thecolonial strategy warped our view of ourselves and our potential. This closelymirrors the experience of native Africans and Americans colonized and enslavedby so-called advanced European societies.It’s probably best to think about the rule of AB gods in the following terms:European colonists used superior firepower to establish control over nativepopulations. They demanded that the natives bow down (worship) and provide theirbest offerings to them, their new overlords. They maintained control using the“divide and conquer” principle, setting locals against one another in order toweaken their solidarity. In the same way, European colonials gave specialprivileges to groups in exchange for manipulation of their own people. Thesesmall groups—sycophants to the king, queen, or whatever title the royalsused—gained access to new and foreign knowledge. Gifts and special prerogativesensured their loyalty to the colonial governors. Ties between collaborators andthe king’s men became stronger than loyalties to even their own families ortribes.This colonial scenario applies to the extraterrestrial occupation of Earth byABs. Even if it wasn’t done deliberately, the fact that ABs mixed with humansintroduced social divisions that further weakened local communities. Homosapiens was seen as a source of labor, considered as a physical resource to beused as the ABs pleased: brute laborers, hewers of wood, drawers of water,miners (in south Africa) of precious metals and stones, foot soldiers, cannonfodder, and even sexual servants. Initially, strong Homo sapiens were sent tothe mines, some used as a support community to provide foodstuffs and other ABneeds. Soon a select few were trained in more personal services. Those whobecame the loyal subjects of the ABs were the seeds of technically advancedhuman cultures. But the aboriginal Homo sapiens population continued to grow.Increasing numbers not needed by the ABs gained independence. Free aboriginalswith the same mixed AB/hominid DNA would spread over the globe, just as ourearlier erectus half-ancestors did. This initial AB input is evident in alliterations of Homo sapiens.Some later mutations occurred in Homo sapiens sapiens as a result of AB-humanmiscegenation. As Genesis 6:2 states, “the sons of the Elohim [ABs] saw thedaughters of men that they were fair, and took themselves wives of all that theychose.” This practice created new genetic combinations and produced new humansocial classes. The ABs created varying human roles and levels of authority,just as the European colonists did much later on. Interpreters became priests,guards became warriors, and personal aides turned into administrators andprofessionals.THE IMPACT OF THE COLONIZATION EXPERIENCEA normally evolving species with the intellectual potential of Homo sapiensought to have continually balanced technical and social change in the interestof its own survival. Yet, inventions in manufacturing, energy, transportation,and weapons today far outpace human capabilities to avoid their self-destructiveconsequences. Our social sciences offer no plausible explanation for such adiscrepancy. We must look elsewhere for an explanation of why humans became soself-destructive, spoiling our “nest” for future generations. Studying ABhistory reveals the true source of these self-destructive habits and internecinewars during the post-Cataclysmic, Annunaki/Elohim colonization.Every religion-based culture today operates on the notion that it is special,selected for that honor by a god or gods who is expected to bail it out in theend. This sense of being the elect absolves the believers from responsibilityfor consequences of their thoughts or actions. Believing that they have TheTruth leads to habitual ignorance or denial of the facts and an inability tosolve self-created problems. However, a subconscious need to fend off religiousdoubt incites conflict and war with others whose Truth contradicts their own. Tomaintain this religious sense of being chosen, believers must remain blind tothe implications of their decisions. How did humans become such a psychologicalmess?During the reign of the AB-gods, primitive humans—intimidated by the “shock andawe” factor of AB extraterrestrial weapons and other technologies—would doanything the ABs ordered. It only took a few generations of harsh punishment forhumans to become conditioned to the custom of obedience and the rituals ofworship. To compensate for humanity’s dependent, slave-like status, the AB-godsmade promises such as: We have chosen you. We will protect you from the wrath ofanother god and his people. You may be rewarded with visits to our kingdom. Andso on. The extreme result of this AB punishment/reward rule was an almostpsychopathic willingness to engage in crusades, inquisitions, jihads, andgenocide to propagate one’s religion or wipe out those of others, preferablyboth. However, not all is gloom and doom. If we choose to, we can excise thesepsychological blocks and remove these blinders that separate us from each otherand prevent our species from achieving a mature culture among other ABs. Thefirst step to becoming a healthy species is to understand the origin ofsupernaturalism.FROM REAL ABS TO SUPERNATURALISMWhen the AB rulers ended their visible presence here on Earth, they leftemotionally dependent humans mourning their absence.14 [ch11.html#ch11not14]Wishing to continue their privileged status, the left-behind priesthood decidedto take advantage of the bereaved to keep them worshiping and sacrificing at theAB alters. So they invented a concept of a divine AB realm, claiming onlypriests could contact the ABs in the heavens. Priests began to supplant realaccounts of ABs and humans with fictional supernatural myths. By embracing aprinciple attributed to the Jewish teacher Jesus—by their fruits shall ye knowthem—we can infer the goals of these early cult leaders by the characteristicsthey sought in their followers: blind faith in their edicts; obeisance toauthority figures; a lack of personal responsibility; and the suppression ofindependent thinking. Sect leaders distorted or destroyed documentation of ABhistory to justify this concocted supernaturalism. Using it to gain control ofconverts, they frightened the faithful into obeying their commandments andpaying support to the royal/priestly elites. (At this point, I wish to make itclear that we learned a great deal from the teachings of Buddha, Lao Tze, andJesus, for example, and that they embodied the cooperative and nurturing traitsnecessary for human self-actualization. Fortunately these positivecharacteristics are widely lauded in virtually every one of today’s religionsand serve as a counterweight to the negative colonial legacy describedpreviously.)A 2,000-YEAR COVER-UPIt should be clear by now that power-hungry descendants of direct AB-humanprogeny covered up the truth about the role of ABs (the so-called gods) in humanhistory. To hide their agenda they created religious supernaturalism andpropagated it through what may be the most comprehensive brainwashing effort inour galaxy. In this they were assisted by a great number of Homo sapiens sapienswho were the household intimates of the early AB-hybrid kings and knew the trueAB story of colonialism. Their descendants became the Hebrew, Egyptian, andRoman priests who conflated the many ABs into one all-powerful god. Humans longconditioned by AB colonials to depend on and even worship them were easilymanipulated by these priest-kings to abdicate any natural impulse towardspiritual and mental freedom. Unfortunately, modern science is not an effectivecounterweight to this deceit. Caught in their own limited dogma, mainstreamscientists neither open themselves to theories that expand their views norchallenge the alleged historical underpinnings of supernaturalism. They learnedlong ago how to benefit from the naive public’s deference to “official”authority and to demonize evidence that might undermine their own godlikepowers.Despite spasmodic periods of intellectual and spiritual renaissance, such aswhat occurred in Greece during classical times, during the zenith of the Libraryin Alexandria, during the growth of Muslim cultures in the 11th century, andduring Europe’s own intellectual awakening in the 15th and 16th centuries, thesupernatural world-view has prevailed for more than two millennia. Themind-limiting nature of top-down religions and financially driven science (bothcontrolled by the same circles, in fact) has effectively blocked the“uninitiated” from any access to or discussion of the evidence for naturalnon-human intelligence and its role in human evolution. Medieval clergy andtheir cohorts in charge of spreading orthodoxy had an institutional interest inmaintaining control of the masses.As new financial and political power groups arose, they saw the benefits ofperpetuating the supernatural god myth to maintain continuing physical andeconomic dominance over both the workers and consumers. This tradition ofpriestly and scientific circles manipulating their deviously implantedsuperstitions has existed since the withdrawal of the AB gods of old. Thesupernatural and materialistic worldviews are now so deeply embedded in thehuman psyche that our acceptance of them is as routine as breathing. After twomillennia of religious and scholarly deception, the modern continuation of thispractice has been easy. Even now, we are still a long way from replacingcult-based theology with fact-based knowledge.Efforts to create a forum for discussion of all the evidence will never besuccessful without a reexamination of the AB history outlined here. We musthonestly face both the psychological impact of being a hybrid race and thewarping of our consciousness by supernaturalism, before society as a whole candeal with current evidence that suggests that the ABs have returned. Uncoveringour true history is an unavoidable prerequisite for creating a healthy humanfuture among ABs in our galaxy and beyond. I believe that a successful strategyaimed at disclosure or revelation of the cover-up must be based on anunderstanding of the colonial model described previously. Those who wish tocreate a more open and mutually beneficial relationship with our AB relativesmust see themselves as leaders of an uprising in a colony that no longer servesany purpose. As all successful revolutions do, they will need help. Perhaps weshould consider the possibility that help may be available from sympathetic ABsamong our former colonizers and oppressors.NOTES1 [ch11.html#ch11not1a]. Von Ward, Paul.

In1477 he was passing through Ireland on his way home from Thule (now believed tobe present-day Iceland or Greenland). There, in Galway, the bodies of a man anda woman washed up on the shore. Presumably they had been drifting across theAtlantic in a boat and did not survive the journey. Because of their skin colorand physiognomy, Columbus believed they were from somewhere in Asia. This wouldnot be the last time such an event would take place during the lifetime of theman who believed he discovered the New World. After this voyage to the north, helived for a short time on Madeira’s smaller isle of Porto Santo, where all kindsof debris would regularly wash up the beach. Columbus was told that carved woodwas occasionally among the flotsam, which some took as evidence of the existenceof an as-yet undiscovered civilization somewhere across the ocean. On the islandof Flores in the Azores, a chain of islands in the mid-Atlantic, he encounteredtwo more of these tragic travelers from across the Atlantic.Although Columbus never did meet one of these living expatriates, others did.Because he made a point to seek out sailors and captains to enrich his studiesin cartography and increase his expertise as a map-seller, it is highly likelythat he was told they came from Katai or Kait-hikan (Algonquin for “great ocean”and “great body of water,” respectively), which actually might have beenreferring to Cathay (China) in the East Indies, the ostensible goal of his owntravels. He had also read Aristotle, who stated that between Iberia and Indiathere existed a navigable sea—the Atlantic. He was also familiar with Pierred’Ailly’s Imago Mundi, and even made a note in the margin stating that India estprope Hispania (“India is near to Spain”), thereby indicating that he did notbelieve that there was any landmass separating Spain from Asia.DISCOVERING THE OLD WORLDEvidence of much older encounters with proto–North Americans crossing theAtlantic existed at that time, although to the Europeans it was uncertain fromwhere these visitors originated. Columbus read of such encounters in HistoriaRerum Ubique Gestarum, by Aeneas Silvio Piccolomini (who would become Pope PiusII). One such story described a voyage (whether it was accidental or not isunknown) of a handful of visitors who had actually made it to Germany duringRoman times. In the margins of the book, Columbus made a notation that they musthave been from Katayo. He believed that such a journey would have been possiblebut quite arduous. Quintus Metellus, the Roman historian and proconsul of Gaul,recorded firsthand this extraordinary visit when the group of visitors wasbrought to him. He, too, believed that their appearance and skin color meantthey were of Asian extraction. In his Historia de las Indias (published in1553), Francisco Lopez de Gomara wrote that he believed these visitors werenatives of Labrador, and that they were merchants traveling the islands of NorthAmerica. De Gomara may have been privy to another, earlier text that recorded avoyage of a canoe as large as an ocean-going barge that carried people from thecoast of the Baccalaos (present-day Newfoundland) to Lubeck, Germany, in 1153.Justin Winsor’s Narrative and Critical History of America contends that thisvoyage was repeated more than once.It should be noted here that Europeans at that time were aware of the Inuitpeoples, who regularly navigated the frigid waters of the north Atlantic. It wasunderstood that their customs and characteristics were different from those ofother indigenous peoples of North America. Certainly, people knew enough abouttheir habits and culture to know that the Inuits could not have created themiddens (piles of discarded oyster shells, fish bones, and other food-relateddebris) that are still preserved today along the New England coastline. Thesepiles (some of which are as large as 150 feet wide and 30 feet high) wereactually left behind by Algonquin-speaking peoples. Oddly enough, such piles canalso be found along the Norwegian coastline, which may indicate some connectionbetween the two cultures.Long before Europeans started exploring the New World in earnest, NativeAmericans, most likely Algonquin-speaking tribes, were already exploring the OldWorld. Cardinal Peter Bembo wrote of seven men reaching Brittany in 1508. Shortof stature, with swarthy skin and broad faces, their skin was marked with violetstreaks. No one could understand their language. The following year another NewWorld expedition to France brought seven more men who were described as wearingonly a sort of belt or loincloth. Most of these journeys were never recorded forposterity, as the travelers did not establish permanent settlements or conquerany territory. Is it possible, then, that an even larger migration from NorthAmerica to the Old World took place?NEW WORLD SEAPOWERIndigenous North American peoples were likely just as adept at crossing longdistances of water as their European counterparts, if not more so. In the North,in present-day Canada, the Inuit navigated icy waters and fished from kayaks andumiaks (one-person boats). Off of what is present-day Montauk in Long Island,various tribes used larger craft to hunt for whale. The historian Samuel EliotMorison wrote that further south of New England, all the way to the CaribbeanSea, travelers used 8-foot-wide canoes that were as long as European galleys.Protected from the sun under awnings of palm, crews of 25 men carried passengersand their goods to market. Some Carib boats were 80 feet long, twice as long assome European ships. Columbus himself recorded seeing fleets of 120 ships with25 armed men in each. (At that point the sail was already in use by Mayans andCarib peoples.) It is not only possible, then, that Native Americans were ableto cross the ocean, but that the inhabitants of the Old World were aware of muchearlier crossings. For example, Pausania, a Greek geographer writing in 150 AD,described a group of islands whose inhabitants, he said, were red-skinned andhad hair like that of a horse. Rather than being a racial characteristic, this“red skin” might have been the result of some kind of face or body paint. All ofthis of course begs the question of whether the ancient Greeks were alreadyaware of Native Americans nearly 1,500 years before Columbus would sail west.In the Northeastern portion of the North American continent there still existtoday numerous tribes that share the Algonquian super-group of languages. Fromthe Labrador Peninsula and the Canadian Maritime province to as far west as theMississippi, numerous tribes still speak variants of this basic language group.These tribal organizations traded with one another extensively via a network ofroads extending from modern-day Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, and from theMississippi all the way to the Atlantic coast. Not all trade was conducted byoverland routes, however. The rivers and the coastal Atlantic regions werebetter served by seagoing traders. The tribe that would have been the mostlikely to have made this cross-ocean contact was the Micmac—also called theSouriquois by the French. The Micmac territory extended as far north as Maine.Their southern neighbors included the Abanaki, Wampanoag, and the Pennacook, aswell as the Lenni-Lenapi group of tribes that extended into Long Island.The Red Paint People (who called themselves the Beothuk) eked out a living inNewfoundland and Labrador for thousands of years. They flourished during theMaritime Archaic period, which lasted from approximately 7000 BC to the mid-18thcentury. Living primarily along the coasts, sometimes as far south as NewEngland, they were skilled canoeists. Their vessels, which they made out ofbirch, were large enough to enable them to catch swordfish and hunt for seal.Fish was the staple of their diet, which they supplemented with shellfish andmeat. They used tools for woodworking, fishing, and hunting. They had anelaborate burial culture and worked in stone, as well. Richard Edens was one ofthe earliest writers to mention them, in his 1555 account of Newfoundland’snatives, titled Gatherings from writings in the New World. He described theBeothuk as having “tawny” skin and commented that they painted their bodies withred ochre, just as their neighbors, the Micmac, did. They further decoratedthemselves with bracelets of silver and copper. Remnants of their culture extendas far inland as Lake Champlain.ADVANCED CULTURE IN THE AMERICASVerrazano, the Italian explorer who sailed for the king of France, Francois I,in 1524, might have been the first European to describe the Algonquin tribes hemet during his exploration of the area spanning present-day New England. Hecalled the area L’Arcadia, a name close to the Micmac word akadie, meaning“place of abundance.” In Europe, Jacobo Sannazarro’s Arcadia was a popular workdescribing an idyllic ancient area in Greece bearing that name. The coincidenceof the very similar Algonquin word might have surprised him. Remarkably,Verrazano recorded bringing a Native American aboard his ship to pilot thevessel into Newport Harbor, which indicates that they must have been able tocommunicate with one another. He, too, described the people as “russet” incolor, and remarked how the queen of the tribe would wait in a boat while themen would come to trade.Not long after Verrazano explored New England, French adventurers under JacquesCartier reached the St. Lawrence River, near what would later become Montreal.They made camp and settled in with hopes of surviving the winter of 1534. Thecruel weather was not the worst of their worries, however, as scurvy began totake its deadly toll. The hideous disease had taken the lives of 25 men, whosebodies were piled under snow drifts, as the ground was too frozen to properlybury the dead. Among the remaining 125, only 10 men were healthy. In order toprevent the nearby Algonquin tribe from finding out just how weak and vulnerablethey were, Cartier and his men attempted to make as much loud noise as theycould, in hopes that it would keep them away. When their Algonquin neighborsfinally made contact with them, it was actually just in time to save theirlives. A medicine man boiled the leaves and bark of a certain tree to make abrew they called annedda, and had the men drink it. All of them were saved,their scurvy cured by the concoction. It wasn’t until 1795 that the British“discovered” the cure for scurvy—which was based on the same knowledge that thenative seagoing peoples of Canada had carried with them for centuries.That the Native Americans had a cure for the greatest plight of long-distancesailors would not be the last surprise for the French. A planned Native villagecalled Hochlaga (which would later grow to become Montreal) had streetsemanating from a central square, a relatively modern conception that was onlyjust being incorporated into cities such as London and Paris. Clearly they werenot the “savages” that they would become in the historical annals of the NewWorld. Just as the Spanish would find the Aztec City of Tenochtitlan to begreater than their own Seville, the Europeans would discover many surprisingthings about the Native Americans.In 1606, the French colonization of Nova Scotia was underway. Lescarbotdescribed the Micmac in his History of New France. He commented that thelanguage of the native peoples was half Basque, which, again, goes to this ideaof early trans-Atlantic contact. Lescarbot met a Micmac ship with a moosepainted on its sail. He assumed they had learned how to sail from fishermen, whoby now had become quite numerous in the rich fishing banks of the New World.Other European authors noted that the Micmac decorated themselves with arm andleg bracelets comprised of shells, wampum, quillwork, and beads. They coveredtheir skin in grease to stave off the mosquitoes and help protect themselvesagainst the elements. The French writer Diereville was able to observe their artof tattooing and described the process in great detail. He commented on thecourage and patience required to endure hours of hours of being painfullypricked by needles on every part of the body, including the face. Women sharedin this art, as well. While the Micmac still used the red ochre paint in theirburial rituals, the extensive tattooing gave rise to a new epithet, “Bluenoses.”Interestingly, after the Roanoke voyage of Sir Walter Raleigh, John White, afamous illustrator, described the Algonquin speaking tribes he met in Virginiaas Picts. This shows that actual eye-witnesses connected the American nativetribes with the Picts of Scotland, and introduces the next part of thisargument.DISTANT COUSINS?On the other side of the Atlantic a tribal people had already taken root in thenorth of Scotland shortly before the first century AD. The Scots called them the“wee dark men.” What they called themselves is not known, although many nameswere later attached to them—one of which, of course, was the Picts. Their namecomes from the Latin picti, which was a general term for the peoples livingnorth of the Forth-Clyde isthmus. Like the Micmac, the Picts tattooed themselvesin blue; thus early writers (including the church historian the Venerable Bede)called them the “painted people.” Scottish and Orcadian folklore depicted themas underground dwellers. They often appropriated cairns and ancient brochs(structures similar to stone igloos, entered by crawling through a shortpassageway into a main circular room) as shelter, which is likely what led tothat distinction. Unfortunately their language, culture, and writing would notsurvive 1,000 years before they were assimilated into the Christianized cultureof the Celts. Therefore much of what we now know of the history of the Pictscomes from outside sources. Perhaps not surprisingly, such sources oftendepicted them in a unflattering light.When Rome conquered Britain the Picts were the only people who remainedunconquered. Roman writers at the time all seemed to share the opinion that theyhad been the dominant power in the north for at least five centuries, althoughthey disagreed on how many discrete groups of Picts there were. Some said theywere two groups, while others contended there were seven separate kingdoms ofPicts. Although the Pictish language has never been interpreted, it is believedthat their tattoos designated individual rank. According to Bede, the Picts wentinto battle naked and in blue paint from head to toe. They were a formidableforce, indeed; their dress (or lack thereof) and their reputation for beingcannibals kept the Roman legions in fear of them.Rome’s conquest of Britain began in AD 43. When they finally advanced to theForth-Clyde line around AD 90, the Roman general Agricola began erecting fortsagainst the fearsome Picts. The Romans stopped there after defeating a largearmy of Caledonians and decided they could go no farther. In 142, Antonine Piusconnected the forts with a massive wall that bore his name. It was hoped thatthe Picts could be contained behind the Antonine Wall, but this arrangement onlylasted 20 years before the powerful Picts caused Rome to retreat south toHadrian’s Wall. Although Hadrian’s Wall was regularly reinforced, Rome wasslowly and inexorably defeated in one skirmish after another. Not surprisingly,the Romans regarded their defeat as the end of the world. After the mighty NinthLegion disappeared beyond the Antonine Wall, no further attempts at conquestwere made. In the 4th century the Picts allied themselves with the Scottiimmigrant tribes, who themselves had originated in Ireland. Rome then had tocontend not only with this northern force but with the Saxon invaders in thesouth. Two major Pictish raids caused Rome to finally sue for peace with thepayment of silver and other commodities. In 412 the final withdrawal of Romecreated a power vacuum, which the Picts gladly exploited. When Rome retreated,the Picts were able to break free from their northern confines and theHighlands. When the Britons finally appealed to the Angles and Saxons to helpdefend against the Picts, the Britons became trapped between the Picts and theGermanic invaders who came not to help, but to conquer.There is no further established history of the Picts until the 6th century. Whenthey became the subject of serious historical research, writers had to contendwith their own prejudice, which often caused them to regard the Picts assavages, as well as with conflicting legends. Gildas, writing in 570 AD, claimedthe Picts had come from some other land across the ocean. He was not aware ofGreenland or the Americas, so he suggested Scythia was the place of theirorigin, by which he may have meant the northerly realms of Eurasia, Finland, orRussia. This same period saw the height of their power and culture. The northernareas of Scotland abound with Pictish crosses and inscribed monuments datingfrom this time. Few of them, however, give even the smallest clues as to whatthe inscriptions mean. Had the Picts remained a dominant force in history, moremight have been learned.ASSIMILATE AND CONQUERWhat the legions of Rome and the warriors of Scotland could not do in battle,Christianity accomplished peaceably. The Picts, never defeated in war, wereassimilated in peace, and inevitably their religion and culture changed. Theiroriginal language was lost as it eventually morphed into Scots-Gaelic. As aresult, the massive amount of stone carvings found throughout Scotland cannot betranslated. Only their place-names remain. John Prebble summed it up best in hisbook, The Lion in the North, saying that the “Picts are a lost race, notremembered with charity.” Others, however, were kinder in their estimations.Robert Bain, author of The Clans and Tartans of Scotland, credits the Picts asthe inventors of the clan system. Because the Picts ruled the Highlands untilthe Vikings began raiding the joint Pict-Scot alliance, it is the Picts, then,and not the Scots, who deserve such credit.SHARED CUSTOMSNo doubt, mainstream historians would find the possibility of a relationshipbetween a North American indigenous people and a Northern European people remoteat best, or simply nonsensical at worst. That said, there are some coincidencesand striking similarities between the two groups that are not easily explainedaway. For starters, both the Micmac and Picts were matriarchal. This meant thatindividuals traced their family through the mother. The Celts, in contrast, werepatriarchal. In fact, matrilineal succession separates the Picts from everyother tribe that occupied the British Isles. Interestingly, the thoroughlyScottish surname MacDuff is likely Pictish in origin. The name literally means“son of (or belonging to) the black (Dubh).” Clan expert Robert Bain declaredthat the MacDuff clan were actually Picts, which was further supported by thefact that their lineage was first traced through the female line.Families of both Picts and Micmac were organized in a clan system. Males in bothgroups wore similar loincloths. Unlike those of other Native American tribes, aMicmac’s loincloth identified his membership in a particular clan. It boresymbols that were very similar to modern Scottish insignias. The loincloth ofthe Picts, and of course the later Highlanders, was the kilt, an article ofclothing that still allows the wearer to distinguish himself as a part of anextended clan. Early kilts carried the animal name of the clan, along with thecolor associated with it—the Red Deer Clan, the White Dog Clan, and so on. Whilefamily was the primary loyalty, clan was also very important. The Clan Chattan,which means the Clan of the Cat, was at one time the largest in Scotland. Withits more modern Viking suffix (-ness), the word yields the name for Scotland’slargest land mass, Caithness. Interestingly, there was also a Clan of the Catamong the Iroquois Nations.The Picts and Micmac also shared similar ways of governing themselves. Peoplehad a say in the election of their sachem (spiritual leader) and chief, and todepose them if needed, as well as a system of inheritance, obligations of mutualassistance and defense, a council of families, clans, and the tribe itself. Aswell, women sat on the council in both Pictish and Micmac communities, and itwas the women who would determine which man would be the chieftain. On bothsides of the Atlantic this custom later gave way to patriarchal customs thatwere more in accordance with the tenets of Christianity. Micmac and Picts alikeelected chiefs who were not succeeded by their sons. Women and men shared in thevote.The two tribes attired themselves similarly, as well. As previously mentioned,both painted their faces and tattooed their skin, and wore little clothing so asto better display their artwork. The Micmac decorated themselves with earrings,nose ornaments, bracelets (worn on the arms and legs), and necklaces of wampum,shells, quillwork, and bells. Similarly, Pictish women adorned themselves withtattoos and jewelry, which may have been a way of displaying wealth or rank. TheMicmac wore feathered headdresses, which announced the wearer’s rank based onthe amount of feathers. This custom was also embraced among the Picts, the onlyEuropean people to denote rank in this manner. Algonquin tribes often used twofeathers to signify a warrior of rank, and one to signify a sachem.The shelters of the Picts and Micmac had much in common, as well. Most cultureswill use whatever building materials are available and useful in gainingprotection from the weather. The Micmac built wigwams, which could be aboveground or, depending on the climate, partially below ground. The Red PaintPeople and the Inuit almost always built their living structures, called gammes,partially under the ground. The Picts built similar houses, called weems, usingditches dug six feet deep into the ground. Some structures were 50 to 200 feetlong and as wide as any modern room. The roofs were then covered with slabs ofstone, turf, and dirt. The Vikings used the same method at the L’Anse auxMeadows settlement in Newfoundland. The Iroquois longhouse was very similarexcept that it was built from timber not found in the more barren north. Theword wigwam remained in North America, while the Pictish weegamme took on themeaning of “small house.”When it came time to celebrate, the dances of the Native American Indian arewell known. In the British Isles it is the Scots and Irish who are best knownfor their dancing. The Highlanders were known for an annual Gathering of theClans, which was also a practice among wider tribal units of Native AmericanIndians. (This is something that is still done today, but from what I have seenit has lost its older significance and has taken on a more commercial function.)The Picts and Micmac also shared many racial characteristics. They were bothshorter than their neighbors, and both had darker complexions. The Celts, incomparison, tended to be tall, with red or blond hair and blue eyes—all part ofthe genetic heritage left behind by Norse invaders. The expression “dark Irish”or “black Irish” survives today to distinguish the Picts from their Celticcousins. Anthropologists claim that there must have been a Mediterranean or evenAfrican genetic influence here, although there is no proof of that.LINGUISTICSOther links are found in the languages of both groups. Though little of thePictish language survives extant, we now know that the prefix maqq- means “sonof,” but it is not followed by a name, as it is in Scottish. Thus, it was likelymeant to designate a member of the tribe or clan that referred to a father. Dr.John Fraser, an Oxford professor of Celtic languages, contends that this isbecause the Picts placed no importance on the father but a great deal ofimportance on the clan. They were all sons of a wider clan group. It wasactually Celtic and Christian influence that elevated the status of the father.Of course the prefix Mac- was and still is always followed by a proper name inScottish.There are other linguistic parallels. When Cartier, the man who would be rescuedfrom scurvy by a more knowledgeable “primitive” people, came to North America hemet a chief whose name he recorded as Donnacana. He said the name was a titlethat meant “royal king,” and believed that all high chiefs took this title. InScotland, the Duncan clan received its name originally from Donnacaidh, who wastheir high chief. This word was also a title of respect, meaning “brownwarrior.”Charles Seaholm, author of The Kelts and the Vikings, continued the search forthe Picts along linguistic lines. He developed his theory by comparing Scottishsurnames with place-names found in New England. The first record of the surnameHosack, in 1508, was one Adam Hosack of Inverness. Inverness was the center ofpower among the southern Picts. The only other record of that name was found inCaithness, the area named for the Clan of the Cat. There exists the Hossack, atributary of the Thurso River. Thurso was not the original name, however: theVikings renamed it after their god Thor long after the Picts became Celts. Onthe other side of the Atlantic there is the Hoosac tunnel in Berkshire County,Massachusetts; a Hoosac Hill in Rockingham County, New Hampshire; the HoosacMountains in Bennington County, Vermont; a Hoosic River, also in Bennington; andseveral other towns named Hoosic in New York State.Pennacook was a Pictish settlement that only became a surname much later, whenthe Normans brought the use of surnames to the British Isles. Pennacook was alsoa settlement in New England that would later become Concord, New Hampshire, whenEuropeans settled there. It was also an Algonquin word meaning “sloping downplace.” In Scotland, the Pennacook clan took their name from a place that bore asimilar description. Kinbuck, a village in Scotland, combines the word kin withthe -uck ending, which is generally considered to be Pictish. Kin and ken oftensignify a connection to water. In New England, Kennebunkport, Kennebec, andKennebago are all places that are located near water.Harvard professor Barry Fell has produced a large list of Algonquin andScot-Irish names. The Merrimack, a river in New Hampshire, means “deep fishing”in the Algonquin language. In Gaelic, merriomack means “of great depth.” Monadin Algonquin means “mountain”, while the Gaelic monadh means the same thing.Nock, an Algonquin word meaning “hill,” corresponds to the Gaelic cnoc which,again, bears the same meaning.There may be less than two dozen surviving inscriptions in the Pictish writtenlanguage. But from what we can deduce from representative samples, Pictishwriting favored double consonants, just as many of the names on thepre-Columbian map of New England did. In the Shetlands, the Lunnastinginscription includes the word ettocuhetts showing the double Ts found inMassachusetts and Attaquahunchonett (in Barnstable County in that state). Placenames in Scotland often end in –ach, -och and –ock, while Algonquin territoryplace names such as Potomac, Rappahanock, and Kennebec have similar soundingendings.Seaholm and Fell’s work on place names has uncovered scores of words that havesimilar or identical meanings on both sides of the Atlantic. Usually these arewords that describe features of geography, such as hills, rivers, or arableland. Neither agrees with just who brought these common words to whom. Fellinsists that the Celts carried them west, while Seaholm claims the Picts wenteast. The question of just who arrived first will likely never be solved.However it needs to be answered, particularly by those who feel the need tolimit the achievements of so-called primitive peoples.THE BASQUE CONNECTIONBasque is often described as the sole surviving, ancient non–IndoEuropeanlanguage in Europe. When Lescarbot commented that the language of the Picts washalf Basque, he knew this from experience. At that point the Pictish languagehad already been forgotten, their inscriptions unreadable. The Picts and theBasques are similar in that their genesis remains unknown, and their languagesunique. John Rhys, a Welsh scholar and professor at Oxford whose specialty wasCeltic civilization, also saw the similarities between the lost language of thePicts and the living Basque language. To that he added one other lost language,the non-Celtic (non–Indo-European) language of the inhabitants of Munster inIreland. The tendency to accentuate the ending consonants in a place or namewere shared by all of these (almost) lost languages and evident across the oceanin North America, as well.image [../images/f0209-01.jpg]Sometime around the first century AD, a migration took place. Painted andtattooed, covered in animal fat, and sailing in lashed-together, hollowed-outlogs, early North Americans crossed the north Atlantic. If they were missed byneighboring tribes, it was never recorded in writing. At the same time a handfulof new peoples appeared on the shores of the Old World. They would remaininsular in a hostile and incomprehensible world. A large number of thesevisitors would stay in the north of Scotland, some would settle in Ireland, andstill others would reach the Bay of Biscay in France and the Pyrénées borderingSpain and France. They would keep their own customs for centuries as well astheir own language. Over time, however, their isolation would not last. As theywere exposed to larger populations, they were assimilated by them. They wouldadd new words to their vocabulary and eventually convert to Christianity. Priorto their conversion, this assimilation was a mere trickle; post-conversion, itwas a flood that altered their customs beyond recognition. In time the maritimeMicmac, along with their Algonquin neighbors, would become patrilinear, as wouldthe Picts, who were assimilated by the Scots and, later, the Norse. Just astheir languages were lost to the sands of time, the memory of this pastconnection between two seemingly disparate groups would be nearly lost, as well.Only time will tell if any new knowledge of this connection will surface,thereby providing greater clarity to this version of history which,unfortunately, still treads outside the margins of accepted knowledge.SOURCESBailey, James.

It’s true.I am not claiming that there is a vast conspiracy in which our spouses,children, and neighbors are sneaking off to the nearest Raelian gathering whenthey say they’re going to Home Depot for light bulbs, nor are they reading thelatest missives from Benjamin Crème on the Internet when we’re not at home. Noram I saying that you need to worry that most of your neighbors and loved oneswill suddenly be found dead one day after having secretly participated in themass hysteria of another Heaven’s Gate or Solar Temple. The UFO cults I amtalking about here are much too big for any of that. In fact, our family andneighbors are probably quite open about their participation therein, and theymay have even already invited you to join. But tell them that they are in a UFOcult, and some of them may wind up giving you a black eye for your efforts.What I am talking about, of course, are the four major organized religions ofthe world.I do not much care for the term cult because it has a pejorative connotationthat is not always deserved. The Quakers, for example, are one of many Christian“cults” (sub-groups), but they are generally respected for their teachings ofpeace and brotherhood. Some fundamentalist Christians call Catholicism a cultdespite the much larger population of Catholics in the world. So when I say “UFOcult,” it just means a distinct group that preaches spiritual messages thatpurportedly come from UFOs.The truth is, religious history is mostly a history of UFO cults. Most UFOcults, of course, begin and remain as marginal “fringe” endeavors. They may makea splash for a while, but most eventually fade into the woodwork. Recentexamples are the so-called Three Georges who founded their quirky UFO cults inthe 1950’s: George Adamski, with his Nordic space alien teachers; George VanTassel, with his channeled messages from Ashtar and other ETs; and George King,who channeled a space-age Jesus on the “etheric plane” of Venus and founded theAetherius Society, which still operates today.There are some people who still hold the mistaken belief that UFOs were firstseen and reported in 1947. The theory goes something like this: We beganexploding atomic bombs, and this raised a red flag for extraterrestrialneighbors that we did not know we had. So they started to covertly surveil Earthto see what we were up to. They did not want to openly interfere in humanaffairs or make their presence known to us childish warlike humans lest wetarget them with our aggressive impulses. So the ETs chose to stay behind thescenes while using contactees and abductees to spread teachings of peace andbrotherhood in the hope that humans would one day become fit to join the cosmiccommunity of the Space Brothers.This is a nice story, but the Ancient Astronaut theory blew a gigantic hole init. The overwhelming evidence indicates that our Space Brothers have beenskulking around Earth long before 1947. We just called them by different namesto match our misunderstanding of what they were. They were “gods” in flyingvehicles, or “angels” in “clouds.” These ancient descriptions were similar, ifnot identical at times to the UFO reports of today. A rose is still a rose, nomatter what you call it. And so today we can identify many ancient cults asactual UFO cults. The Egyptian cults of the pharaoh believed that some of theirkings were sired by ET “gods.” The Mayans depicted human-like gods in brightflying globes observing and participating in the human warfare below. Theseancient UFO cults, some of which go all the way back to ancient Mesopotamia,eventually disappeared along with the civilizations that embraced them. Or didthey?As Exhibit A, I give you a man named Moses. Raised in Egypt under the pharaohs,he grew up to become leader of a tribe that was guided by a UFO cult of its own:the cult of Abraham. The “god” of this cult was called “Jehovah”—a “god” thathas provided more fuel for Ancient Astronaut theorists than almost any other.Under the guidance of Jehovah, Moses led his tribe out of Egypt to establish theJewish religion in the Middle East. Jews still believe in Jehovah as their god,and they still cling to the texts that describe ancient UFOs as the source oftheir religion, be it the flying vehicle of fire and smoke described in Exodusor the “wheels within wheels” described in Ezekiel. And let’s not forget theother Old Testament prophets, such as Elijah, who was supposedly taken up bodilyinto the sky by this god. Judaism is a UFO cult that made it big. And by “madeit big” I mean that it has survived for thousands of years and has achievedgreat prominence, even if its membership is relatively small (less than onepercent of the human population today). Judaism spawned two other UFO cults thatbecame even larger: Christianity and Islam.I now submit for your consideration Exhibit B: the New Testament. What more canbe said about UFOs in the Christian scripture that has not already beenexpressed many times over? The New Testament is probably the most quoted text inAncient Astronaut literature. Add the remarkable UFO-like episodes in theChristian apocrypha, and we have a veritable buffet piled high with tasty treatsthat have piqued the palates of ufologists for more than half a century.Today, about a third of the human population identifies itself as Christian.They still believe in the Jewish Jehovah as their god. They still thrill to thestory of the star of Bethlehem, which in the apocrypha is described as anintelligently guided craft that moves across the sky and then hovers. Christiansstill believe in the vision of Paul on the road to Damascus, which also haselements of a UFO abduction or contactee event. And many Christians long for thecommencement of future events predicted in the Book of Revelation, which hasJesus clothed in something that resembles a spacesuit. The experiences of John,the author of Revelation, also seem reminiscent of a UFO abduction. The bottomline is that Christianity in all its guises and incarnations is just a UFO cult,even if many of its members would vigorously deny that they believe in UFOs. Thenext time you drive by a Christian church, understand that you are driving by abuilding dedicated in large part to a belief in UFOs and alien entities.And finally we come to Exhibit C, Islam. It all started with Mohammad sitting ina cave meditating. The Christian “angel” Gabriel suddenly appeared to him on thehorizon, put Mohammad into a trance, and relayed a religious message. Mohammadclaimed that his new sect fulfilled the promises of two religions (read: UFOcults) that had come before him, namely Judaism and Christianity. Today morethan 20 percent of the world’s population follows the teachings of Mohammad.And what of Hinduism? Hinduism is actually a hodge-podge of several differentreligious beliefs and myths. Its colorful pantheon of gods adorned many a hippieabode during the 1960s, and the artwork is still popular in many parts of theworld today. Some of those gods flew vimanas—another topic of great interest toAncient Astronaut theorists—which were armed with weapons that soundsuspiciously like high-powered laser beams. There are Hindus today who dream ofliving with the god Krishna in human-like bodies on another planet. These areall the classic elements of a UFO cult. Currently Hindus represent about 14percent of the human population.Does this mean that there is no God? No consciousness separate from the body? Nosoul? So is it all just about humans and UFOs?Not necessarily.UFO cults large and small usually address deeper spiritual questions with anaffirmation that there is a spiritual reality that underpins the fabric of theworld. This is not surprising given the fact that there is often a spiritualelement to descriptions of UFO contacts, especially those involving anout-of-body experience. Ancient and modern abductee stories usually involvebeing in-body during an abduction event, but there are times when it involvesaccompanying the ET while out-of-body. ETs are often credited with having theability to direct a human consciousness out of the body, carry it in some kindof container, and then place it back in the body. These kinds of themes foundtheir origin in ancient Mesopotamian UFO cults, were echoed in the beliefs ofthe pre-Columbian Americas, continued in some of the Christian apocrypha, andare repeated in a number of modern UFO cases.Does this mean that ETs were and are more “spiritual” than us mere humans?Again, not necessarily. Maybe they are just better mechanics. The evidence forUFOs suggests that their society is much more technologically advanced thanours, which means that they have had more time to figure out how it all works.They do things that seem magical or mystical to us (including those thingsrelating to matters of biology and consciousness), but which are simply a matterof mechanics to them. This does not necessarily mean that ETs are generally more“evolved” or more ethical than humans. Any moral judgment here would dependentirely on their motives, just as it does in our case. We have learned to splitthe atom for wondrous or nefarious ends. Likewise, we can use our knowledge ofpsychology to help or manipulate others. Moral and ethical evolution is aseparate process from technological evolution, and this is likely true of theETs, as well. We should expect any ETs to place first priority on their ownneeds, just as every living thing does here on Earth.Where does all this leave us today?First, we need to appreciate that the impact of human contact with UFOs on ourcivilization has been enormous. The major religions of today are largely theresult of that contact. This means that UFOs are not just a silly little fringephenomenon that is only of interest to kooks. It is a substantial, significant,and, above all, real phenomenon that has been around for a very long time. Justbecause ETs seem evasive and elusive does not make them any less real; just lookat the various creatures and species on Earth that have been difficult to findand track. Clearly, this is a trait that extends across many life forms—and manyworlds.Second, we as the human race need to decide if we should keep participating inUFO cults, including the larger ones. I, for one, remain firmly committed toreligious freedom, and I am in no way suggesting that any laws should be passedto ban any form of religious expression or non-violent religious practice. Ipropose instead only a voluntary “weaning” process. After all, are the beliefsof the major UFO cults really of any benefit to us? Yes, the Jewish, Christian,Islamic, and Hindu scriptures contain some fine teachings, but they also tend toencourage an attitude that fosters division and inflames conflict. The realquestion, of course, is why ETs would encourage such belief systems in the firstplace, since UFOs seem to be the source for much of it, but that is a questionbetter left to another essay.And what about those eschatological promises of a coming apocalypse? Why did somany Biblical prophets, such as Ezekiel and John, receive apocalyptic messagesfrom these ET sources? Why would ETs want to drive humans to the brink ofhysteria with teachings about an inevitable violent end to all that is? Again,these are questions best left to another essay—perhaps an entire book. Sufficeit to say that belief systems that have an apocalypse theircenter—eschatology—breed anxiety and encourage radicalism. They hide the obviousfact that if and when something bad happens, it will be because someone plannedit, because someone was careless, or because there was a cataclysmic failure ofnature that we were powerless to stop. It would have nothing to do with any god.Many modern scientists have been trying to encourage just such a weaningprocess. They fail, though, when they become stubborn ideologues for thestrictly secular. They would be much more successful by pushing ahead with openminds into the realm of quantum processes and by searching for the secret ofconsciousness behind the observer phenomenon. If the Catholic Church and TibetanBuddhists can come around to embracing many elements of science, then sciencecan certainly start taking a better look at the evidence regarding consciousnessand UFOs that simply won’t go away. When they block academic and scientificresearch into these topics of popular interest, so-called radical secularists doas much to spread pseudoscience as the goofiest UFO contactee ever has. This, ofcourse, leaves a void that is often filled by people with less vigorous andstringent academic principles.The world of UFO study today is highly polarized. The field desperately needspragmatic, nuts-and-bolts scientists to collect reports, regress abductees, andanalyze the evidence. Without this kind of groundwork, ufology cannot exist as alegitimate area of inquiry. The people who do this kind of work, however, resentthe intrusion of “wackos” and “conspiracy theorists” who at first blush alwaysseem to muddy the waters. This conflict arises from a truth about the UFOphenomenon itself: UFO behavior is sometimes, well, wacky. As well, behind thefacade of the kindly Space Brothers there is sometimes evidence of lessbeneficent intent. After all, if a group of human beings were to skulk aroundabducting other humans, we would look at their motives with great skepticism, tosay the very least. So it is natural to feel that kind of doubt—and evenfear—regarding an influx of ET visitors that has done and is still doing justthat.UFO researchers are often called on to answer the common question of why the ETsare here in the first place. They are faced with a wide array of oftenconflicting evidence that has yielded a variety of conclusions. Thereforeanswers to this question have run the gamut from “They just want to quietlycheck us out” to “In their minds, they own the joint.” As well, we now haveancient creation stories suggesting that ETs genetically engineered the humanrace in pre-history and have been keeping a watchful eye on their creation eversince. Where does the truth really lie? We have yet to figure it out for sure.We can begin by studying what is in front of us, but in the world of UFOs, eventhat can lead down some rather strange paths. There is just no getting aroundthat. In the meantime we live with the effects of UFO contact every day,particularly as evidenced in the tapestry of UFO cults that have impacted humansociety in such a tangible and lasting way.If we could even imagine a world without UFO cults, what would it look like? Ifall the large UFO cults were to disappear, I suspect that we would all be ableto breathe a big sigh of relief. Most conflicts and wars would end. Religiousradicalism would disappear almost entirely. We would still believe in UFOs, butwe would stop granting them their undeserved aura of mystery and menace. Wewould no longer need to worry that there is a God-ordained apocalypse on thehorizon, and we could more rationally plan for natural disasters. I believe thatwe could also more reasonably arrange our global financial structure to end theunnecessary economic problems of today, and solve any overpopulation issuesusing win-win solutions. Our better understanding of consciousness could alsoease the fear and pain of loss that comes with death. Religion would become moreabout understanding and discovery than about obedience. Life on Earth couldbecome genuinely fun.Some people might object to this scenario. They would say that the large UFOcults are the basis of human morality, and that we need the structure imposed bythe directives of scripture to stay civilized. The good news is that people canbe quite moral without religion, and usually are. Look at where religion isweakest in the Western world: Scandinavia. The Scandinavian countries stillenjoy some of the lowest crime rates and highest standards of living in theworld. The character of an individual seems to have more to do with innatemorality than any religious affiliation.But this is not an essay about morality or religion in general. It is aboutUFOs—more specifically, UFO cults. Much more can be said about these cults, andthey make for an interesting study. Whatever you do, just don’t underestimatethem. A marginalized little UFO cult today could one day surprise us and becomeone of the world’s major religions tomorrow. It has happened before, and itcould happen again."},{"pageContent":"A SYMBOLIC LANDSCAPE: THE MYSTERY OF NABTA PLAYA AND OUR ANCIENT PASTBy Thomas A. BrophyWhere did the ancient Egyptian civilization, home of the greatest monumentbuilders of all time, come from? Will mysterious clues waiting to be decipheredonce again revolutionize our knowledge of our distant past? My research into theastronomy of Nabta Playa has led to answers to the first question, and someintriguing hints regarding the second.In early April of 2008, we—my coauthor Robert Bauval, a small team of intrepidadventurers, a deep desert explorer named Mahmoud Marai, and myself—were fourdays into a strenuous journey by four-wheel-drive Jeep, through totally desolateterrain in one of the most arid environments on earth, and four days from anyhint of modern civilization. Because we had to pack all our supplies, includingall our water, with us, once we were at our final destination we would have onlyprecious few hours to accomplish our goals and also do some exploring. On thisparticular day we were braving the blazing midday heat to explore the northwestface of a small bluff on the north of a mountain range called Jebel Uwainat.Uwainat is a massive, table-topped mountain range straddling the uninhabitedregion of the Sahara desert where Egypt, Sudan, and Libya meet. It is so remoteand inhospitable that the mere existence of this “Alps of the desert” was noteven known to the modern world until the 1920s. On the rock face that containeda faded prehistoric painting of a life-sized giraffe and a hunter (or possibly ashaman-like figure), a member of our team scrambled 12 feet up the side of thecliff to a small ledge of some natural flow-stone. He excitedly exclaimed thathe had found some engravings. When I joined him, I immediately cursed the factthat I didn’t have my electronic compass, for there, amongst the strangeengraved markings, was a beautifully formed arrow pointing to thewest-northwest. After retrieving my compass I had to keep badgering our guide,Mahmoud, to take us back to the rock face so that I could measure it. Marai waseager instead to return us to our camp site, which had been carefully chosen toseclude us from the Sudanese bandits that occasionally pass through this lawlessarea. Finally I got back to the rock ledge engravings and, sure enough, thefinely wrought arrow pointed toward the summer solstice sunset.image [../images/f0220-01.jpg]Elevated rock ledge, Jebel Uwainat, April 2008. Note the engraved lines andarrow pointing to the summer solstice sunset.We may well have been the first human beings to see these engravings inthousands of years. Most of the rock art in this region dates from as far backas 12,000 years ago up to the most recent, from about 6,000 years ago, when theregion became the extreme desert it is today. The engraved rock art tends to beolder than the painted rock art. Did the artist or artists who engraved thearrow actually intend to indicate this yearly astronomical event, or was it onlyrandom chance? Did the markings represent some sort of early proto-writing? Whowere the people who made them? A clue to these questions can be gleaned from theastronomy at the so-called Calendar Circle of Nabta Playa, some 360 miles dueeast from these engravings, because it, too, indicates the summer solstice.Could the two peoples who created these two artifacts be related? It is mybelief that they are not only related to each other, but were in fact thepeoples who later moved to the Nile and created the pharaonic civilization ofancient Egypt.In our book Black Genesis, Robert Bauval and I present the evidence that theNeolithic peoples who created the plentiful rock art in the Jebel Uwainat andGilf Kebir regions of the Egyptian Western Desert (the northeastern Sahara) wereof the same culture that built the Neolithic regional ceremonial complex atNabta Playa. And we show that it was those peoples who moved to the Nile Valleyand created the pharaonic civilization, precisely when the region suddenlytransitioned from temperate savanna to the extreme desert that it is today.A NEOLITHIC ASTRO-CEREMONIAL CENTERIn 1973, an international team of anthropologists called the CombinedPrehistoric Expedition (CPE), headed by Fred Wendorf and Romuald Schild, wereabout 65 miles west of Abu Simbel, taking a comfort break from their labors.Someone looked down and noticed numerous potsherds and fine stone tools. Theyhad discovered what came to be known as Nabta Playa. It soon became obvious thatNabta Playa was a very important site, and the CPE focused its efforts onexcavating there every winter when the heat becomes more bearable. Theyuncovered, catalogued, and radio carbon–dated numerous layers of artifactsdating from circa 7000 BCE to 3300 BCE. They found tombs of cattle that had beenritually interred. Though no human remains were found at Nabta Playa, agraveyard from the same era was found about 12 miles away. They found remnantsof jewelry that, because of the shells and materials it was made of, must havecome through trade from as far away as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Thesite was used extensively by peoples from all around the region, and clearlyinvolved important ritualistic activities. Wendorf and Schild began calling thesite a Neolithic era “regional ceremonial center” even before they noticed whatNabta Playa would become famous for—the megaliths. It seems strange they didn’tnotice the megaliths. As Fred Wendorf himself wrote:The megaliths of Nabta were not recognized or identified for a long time. Webegan to realize their significance only in 1992….1 [ch14.html#ch14not1] [I]t isnot clear why we failed to recognize them previously, or rather why we failed tounderstand their significance…. It was not that we did not see them because wedid, but they were either regarded as bedrock or, in some instances where it wasclear they were not bedrock, regarded as insignificant.”2 [ch14.html#ch14not2]The megaliths and megalithic constructions at Nabta Playa were clearly the mostcentral aspect of the site and the rituals that were conducted there, and theyrequired much effort and social organization to construct. There remain manymysteries about the megaliths, but nearly everyone agrees that they served anastronomical purpose of some sort. There is debate about which specificastronomy is involved, but it seems clear that Nabta Playa was not only aregional ceremonial center, but it was also a regional astro-ceremonial center.The visible portion of the megalith arrangements consists primarily of sixalignments of stones that radiate out from one central point like the spokes ofa wheel. There are three alignments to the north-northeast direction, and threealignments to the east-southeast. The most robust interpretation is that thenorth-northeast alignments refer to one or more circumpolar stars, and theeast-southeast alignments refer to the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, andthe stars of Orion’s Belt. Given that Nabta Playa was in use for more than 26centuries, and given the fact that the megaliths had been constructed duringthat time frame and possibly even before it, it is likely that the alignmentsrepresented celestial events occurring during more than one epoch. Because stars“move” due to the precession of the earth, any single alignment can refer to anygiven star at only one specific date. Thus the multiple megalith alignments mayhave been used to refer to certain sets of stars at certain dates long ago.In 1997, the CPE finally invited Kim Malville, an astronomer, to visit the siteduring the winter excavations. In 1998, Malville and the CPE mentioned themegaliths in a report published in Nature.3 [ch14.html#ch14not3] However, thearticle focused mainly on the Calendar Circle—a separate device made of smallstones, not megalithic ones. They described the megaliths and their alignmentsbut did not associate them with astronomy, except to note that some alignmentspointed roughly north, and that one megalith alignment was astonishingly preciseto due east, with azimuths (increments of direction from due north) of 90.02degrees”4 [ch14.html#ch14not4] The first mention of the astronomy of themegaliths was in a brief article by Wendorf and Malville within the massive bookpublished by the CPE in 2001.5 [ch14.html#ch14not5] In it, Malville proposedthat the three northerly alignments of megaliths tracked the star Dubhe from4742 BCE to around 4200 BCE, and of the three southeasterly alignments ofmegaliths, one was aimed at Sirius sometime around 4820 BCE, and the two otherstracked the stars of Orion’s Belt at two other dates. That article also listedthe exact GPS coordinates of each megalith. When I attempted to reproduce theircalculations, however, I found that some of the stars had not been at thelocations given on the dates claimed. So I tried to simply calculate themegalith alignment azimuths from their raw GPS data, and found several of thosecalculations could not be reproduced, either. I attempted to discuss thediscrepancies with the authors, but to no avail. The logical assumption was thatthe primary raw GPS data should be the most reliable, while their calculationswere in error. So, keen to decipher the astronomy of Nabta Playa, I took theirraw GPS measures for the megaliths and attempted to solve the puzzle of theastronomy independently. This I published in The Origin Map, believing it was ofmore service to generate some interest in the site and its intriguing astronomyrather than wait until the CPE responded, which could have been indefinitely. Asit turns out, my calculations showed the megalith alignment they had given tothe rising of Sirius circa 4820 BCE actually aligned with Sirius circa 6090 BCE,a date that, as we shall see, became problematic.Meanwhile, the Quickbird satellite had just been launched by Digital Globecorporation, and I estimated its resolution might be able to pinpoint themegalith locations from space. I tasked the Quickbird to acquire image data(surely its first independent use for archaeo-astronomy), and I was elated tofind that I could identify all of the megaliths described by Wendorf in his 2001publication.6 [ch14.html#ch14not6] As I expected, the raw GPS data from the CPEseemed to be accurate. But to be certain, I needed to visit the site in personand take measurements on the ground, which I did in October of 2003. I thenteamed up with my old colleague Paul Rosen (a leader in space-based radar remotesensing) to georectify the satellite data and vet the scientific reasoning. Wepresented the results at a conference on ancient megalithic cultures, in Rhodes,Greece, and in a peer reviewed journal.7 [ch14.html#ch14not7] We reported thatthe date for the Sirius alignment given by Malville and Wendorf would have to bemoved all the way back to 6090 BCE. We also contended that the threesoutheasterly megalith lines could be interpreted as representations of thestars of Orion’s Belt and the stars of Orion’s head and shoulders, all circa6200 BCE, while the northerly megalith lines indicated the brightest star in thenorth at the time, Vega.Our publication finally prompted a response to my questions about the initialfaulty calculations, in the form of a paper by Malville et al. in 2007.8[ch14.html#ch14not8] In it, they acknowledged our corrected data andcalculations, and they reinterpreted the megalith alignments, now asserting thatthe megaliths they originally associated with Sirius circa 4820 BCE may havebeen away from the ancient lake, or playa, so they now “decline[d] to interpretthem,”9 [ch14.html#ch14not9] suggesting instead that the other southeasterlymegalith lines may have indicated the rising of Sirius circa 4500 BCE and 3500BCE. They also suggested an alignment to Orion’s Belt circa 4200 BCE, andpossibly Alpha Centauri on another date, and they proposed an entirely newtarget for the northerly megalith alignments—Arcturus. Finally they rejected anydates circa 6200 BCE because that is “about 1,500 years earlier than our bestestimates for the Terminal Neolithic.”10 [ch14.html#ch14not10]By then, I had teamed up with Robert Bauval to further research this and a rangeof other topics that became our book Black Genesis: The Prehistoric Origins ofAncient Egypt. We concluded that the southeasterly megaliths very likely didindicate the rising of Sirius. Furthermore, we remembered that early Old KingdomEgyptian temples had been aligned simultaneously with the rising of Sirius andwith the star Dubhe in the north, and so we decided to test for suchsimultaneous alignments at Nabta. We were surprised to find very accuratesimultaneous markings of the rising Sirius with Dubhe in the sky at both dates,4500 BCE and 3500 BCE, and these simultaneous alignments also formed very neatright angles. These two sets of alignments thus accounted for four of the sixmajor lines of megaliths at Nabta Playa, as we wrote in Black Genesis:The findings that emerge from this integrated analysis are:1. There are at least nine megaliths that form the three lines—A1, A2, andA3—that point north. These track the star Dubhe in the Big Dipper over aconsiderable period of time.2. There are at least six megaliths that form lines B1 and B2 pointingsoutheast. These track the bright star Sirius at two epochs.3. Sirius also coordinated simultaneously with the star Dubhe in the Big Dipperso that their alignments formed an approximate 90-degree angle. (This curiousconnection also had been noted by Wendorf and Malville; they commented that themegalith builders of Nabta Playa had ‘a fascination with right angles.’)11[ch14.html#ch14not11]Note that these simultaneous Sirius-Dubhe alignments occur when Sirius is justrising above the horizon, and Dubhe is positioned at a low altitude in the sky,as signified both in the Egyptian temples and at Nabta Playa. At first thoughtit might seem awkward for naked-eye astronomer-priests to simultaneously note astar (Sirius) breaking the horizon and its partner star (Dubhe) 90 degrees tothe north and up in the sky. But Nabta Playa was a seasonal lake duringNeolithic times (which is why Wendorf dubbed it a “playa” in the first place).It was filled with shallow water part of the year, and the megaliths that wouldhave emerged out of the still water may well have reflected starlight directlyalong the sight line to an observer. This would have made the alignments readilyapparent for an observer situated at the central megalithic construction. Wesuggest this ritual of the simultaneous sighting of the rising of Siriustogether with a bright star in the circumpolar constellation—in this case, Dubhein the Big Dipper (which the ancient Egyptians called the Bull’sThigh)—originated at Nabta Playa, and was later taken to the Nile Valley. AtNabta Playa the star sightings were both ritual and actual, involving themegalithic constructions and the giant natural reflecting pool that was theancient seasonal lake. Later, in the pharaonic culture, the ritual became morestylized and symbolic, embodied in the “stretching of the cord” ceremony that isdepicted in temple art. As we describe in Black Genesis:The ancient Egyptian texts and temple reliefs explain that stretching the cordwas carried out by a priestess, who represented a deity associated with thestars, and the pharaoh. Both the priestess and pharaoh held a rod and a mallet,and a rope or cord was looped between the rods. The priestess stood with herback to the northern sky and faced the pharaoh. This scene is depicted on manytemples, and the texts alongside it tell us that the pharaoh observed thetrajectory of the stars with his eye in order to establish the temple in themanner of ancient times. In the texts we are unequivocally told that the kinglooked at a star in the Big Dipper (called Mesekhtiu, the Bull’s Thigh). Some ofthe texts, however, mention the star Sirius and imply that it also was somehowinvolved in the ritual. Exactly how was this stellar alignment ritual performed?[…] A further clue to the ritual is that the pharaoh observed carefully themotion of a star in real time. Inscriptions on the Temple of Horus at Edfu,accompanying portrayals of the ritual, quote the pharaoh: ‘I take the measuringcord in the company of Seshat. I consider the progressive movement of the stars.My eye is fixed on the Bull’s Thigh constellation. I count off time,scrutinizing the clock…’ This is also what might have happened at the ceremonialcenter of Nabta Playa thousands of years earlier….12 [ch14.html#ch14not12]Around 3300 BCE, the Nabta Playa area became the uninhabitable, extremely ariddesert that it is today. Directly following that date is when the earliesttemples of the ancient Egyptian civilization began popping up in the NileValley, especially the temple of the goddess Satis on Elephantine Island nearAswan. The first known version of the temple was built circa 3200 BCE, but itwas rebuilt several times over 3,000 years, its axis changing to align with therising of Sirius as the star’s declination changed through precession.In the ancient Egyptian civilization the new year was marked by the heliacalrising of Sirius, an astronomical event that also heralded the life-giving andcivilization-supporting inundation of the Nile river. The heliacal rising of astar is when it first becomes visible, glimmering for a few minutes before thedawning brightness of the sky overpowers the starlight at sunrise. In ancientEgypt the brilliant Sirius would have been invisible to the naked eye for aperiod of about two months or so every year, when it was too close to the sun.By the time of New Kingdom Egypt, at least from what the great tourist Herodotuswrote, the Egyptians had forgotten that the source of the flooding of the Nilewas the monsoon rains that engorged the river upstream, but they did rememberthat the floods were symbolically heralded by the heliacal rising of Sirius.Earlier, during the time of Nabta Playa, the megalith builders marked the risingof Sirius simultaneously with the Bull’s Thigh constellation (Dubhe) for atleast 1,000 years (4500 to 3500 BCE), precisely when the monsoon rains directlyfell on the playa and inundated the seasonal lake that would, in turn, reflectthe starlight onto the megaliths they had constructed. The connection of theheliacal rising of Sirius with the coming of the annual life-supporting rainswas direct, obvious, and visceral, the heavenly events coinciding with the newyear renewal of the playa on earth. When the monsoon rains moved south and lefttheir regional astro-ceremonial complex uninhabitably dry, the people of NabtaPlaya moved to the Nile Valley and created the greatest temple-buildingcivilization of history.We believe the megalithic tracking of Sirius and the circumpolar Bull’s Thighconstellation is a very robust and defensible interpretation for the function ofsome of the megaliths at Nabta Playa. It is the astronomy associated withearlier dates, however, that is more controversial, because it brings in themore mysterious aspects of the site. Before I discuss these dates, however, Ifirst need to mention the most famous feature of Nabta Playa, the so-calledCalendar Circle. The Calendar Circle is made of stones that come up to aboutone’s knee, or a little shorter. As we describe in Black Genesis, the CalendarCircle itself has suffered a convoluted history. For some reason, the firstmention of it was not until the famous 1998 Nature paper, even though theprimary mapping and archaeological analysis of the Circle had been done in 1991and 1992. And surely it was known about in 1974. Meanwhile the whole Nabta Playasite was left unguarded, and the excavation methods used were generallydestructive to the site and its environs. The remains of excavations of themegalithic complex structures, for example, were left in a circle of detritusclearly visible in satellite images.As to the interpretation of the astronomy of the Calendar Circle, there is anon-controversial aspect and a controversial aspect. The non-controversialaspect is this: Eight stones on the circumference of the circle form four gatesthat create two “sight-line windows”—one window indicates the north-southdirection, and the other window indicates the rising sun on summer solstice.Also, the location of the site itself, at about 22.5 degrees north latitude,near the tropic line, means the sun passed exactly overhead twice per yearduring the weeks surrounding summer solstice, and the standing stones would nothave cast any shadows at noon. The solstice gates and the meridian (north-south)gates are approximate alignments spread over a few degrees of arc and thuscannot be used to date the circle from the small changes in the earth’sobliquity.The controversial aspect refers to the actual contents of the circle—sixstanding stones arranged in two sets of three. My approach was to consider thesolstice and meridian gates of the circle as vital clues to its overallfunction. This interpretation was published in the book The Origin Map, andpresented at professional conferences in Rhodes, Greece; in Atlanta, Georgia; atgeneral audience conferences around the world; in a TV/DVD graphic animation;and, together with Robert Bauval, in my recent book Black Genesis. All of myinterpretations refer to the careful original mapping of the reconstructedcircle by Applegate and Zedeno in 1991/1992.13 [ch14.html#ch14not13] Thesolstice gate tells the visitor what time of year is relevant—summer solstice.The meridian gate tells the visitor where to look in the sky—up along thenorth-south meridian (which is the same standard reference astronomers still usetoday). Together, the gates also tell the visitor what time of day to look—justbefore sunrise while the sky is still dark. The contents of the circle form asimple star map that the visitor can then visually translate up into the sky inorder to identify the asterism indicated inside the circle. Thus armed with thetime of year, the time of night, and the area of sky to look at, the onlyadditional factor (constraint, in physics parlance) I needed to consider waswhich year or years. The radiocarbon dates from a nearby hearth supplied thatclue—around 4800 BCE. As I calculated what the sky must have looked like at thattime, it soon became apparent that the three stars of Orion’s Belt would be goodcandidates for the lower set of the three standing stones in the circle. Furtherinvestigation showed that the Orion’s Belt stars generally fit during a windowof time from about 6400 to 4800 BCE, with the best fit occurring around 4940BCE. At this time, just the right altitude was represented, at a special time inthe long-term precession of those stars—exactly halfway between southernculmination and northern culmination. I also proposed a more speculativeinterpretation for the other set of three stones inside the circle—namely, thatthey match the top part of the Orion constellation (the shoulder and head stars)at the opposite part of the precession cycle (about 12,000 years earlier). Sothe Calendar Circle was likely constructed and used around 5000 BCE (andcertainly not in 17000 BCE), and it was a diagram to teach about the long-termtrajectories of the stars above. Just as the summer solstice sunrise “sight-linegate” on the outer part of the circle taught about the annual motion of the sunthrough the sky over one year, the inner stones of the circle taught about the26,000-year precession of the constellations. In this way the Circle isinextricably linked to the megalithic alignments at Nabta Playa, which alsorefer to Orion’s Belt and the rising of Sirius.THE MYSTERY OF THE BEDROCK SCULPTURESThe Calendar Circle also gives us a hint about the more mysterious parts ofNabta Playa. The star-aligned megaliths are embedded in the playa sediments.According to paleo-climatologists and the radiocarbon dates of sedimentarylayers, the last period of heavy sedimentation that yielded the final thicklayer of sediments ended sometime around 5000 BCE. Therefore the megalithsembedded in that layer must have been placed during or after that time. That iswhy controversy arose over the megalith alignment that the CPE first ascribed toSirius circa 4820 BCE, which our measurements and calculations showed actuallyaligned 1,270 years earlier. But the puzzle is complicated by what is foundunderneath the playa sediments, especially underneath the centerpiece called“Complex Structure A” (CSA). All the megalith alignments radiate out from CSA.CSA is comprised of several parts: on top of the sediments are megalithsarranged in a large oval with a standing stone in the center; under that is someplaya sediment and a large sculpted megalith (called the “cowstone”); and thenunderneath the cowstone lies a sculpted lump of living bedrock (bedrock that isstill connected to the original bedrock, not cut off as the Great Sphinx is)about 12 feet under the surface of the playa sediments. CSA sits in a field ofabout 30 of these complex structures—all similar except the others don’t havethe additional cowstone sculpture.Nabta Playa is a bedrock basin covered by sedimentary layers of variousthickness (some several yards deep) that were laid down during a period of about10,000 years, from 15,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago, mostly during a seriesof humid interphases from around 9,500 to 7,000 years ago. When the CPEexcavated the Complex structures and found that they were actually coveringbedrock sculptures under 9 to 12 feet of sediment, they were at a loss as to howto explain the creation of these structures. The standard conception ofNeolithic culture is such structures could not have been built by them. So theCPE theorized that the people of Nabta Playa, sometime after 7,000 years ago,somehow figured out where the bedrock lumps (called lenses of quartziticsandstone) were located, dug through the sediments, sculpted the bedrock lumps,filled the sediments back in, and then arranged the oval of megaliths on top ofthe sediments, leaving them thus for us to dig up today. Obviously there areseveral problems with this scenario. For one, CSA is the centerpiece of all themegalith alignments (the oldest of which is at least 6,500 years old), and so itmust predate them. Another problem is that there was no possible way theNeolithic peoples could have figured out where the bedrock lumps were, under allthat sediment, in order to carry out such a strange series of constructionsteps. And of course there is the question of why they would do such a thing inthe first place. We suggested that a more likely solution is the bedrocksculptures actually are older.14 [ch14.html#ch14not14] By the time they wrotetheir 2007 article, the CPE agreed that the bedrock sculptures must havepredated the others, as part of an older symbolic landscape that was marked bycairns (burial mounds) and a sequence of constructions leading up to the Complexstructures we find today. The megalithic alignments placed on top of thesediments from 5000 BCE to 3500 BCE therefore incorporated, and in fact arrangedas their centerpiece, the much older bedrock sculptures.When were they first constructed, and for what purpose? Why were they soimportant or sacred that people continued to maintain them and incorporate theminto their later ceremonial constructions for thousands of years? Does suchfealty imply a greater degree of cultural (or religious or technological)continuity than was once believed? If the later megalithic alignments wereprimarily astronomical (as well as religious), does that suggest the muchearlier bedrock sculptures were also astronomical? The answers to thesequestions are unknown. The CPE completely excavated only two of thesestructures, partially excavated a third, and drilled test holes into two more.They concluded that all (approximately 30) of the structures probably have asculpted bedrock lump underneath. It is interesting that these bedrocksculptures date back to the same earlier epoch as has been proposed for theGreat Sphinx at Giza, which itself is a giant bedrock sculpture. GeologistRobert Schoch and others have shown that the Sphinx and its bedrock enclosurewere weathered by heavy rains that occurred before the standard dating ofDynastic Egypt. It is essentially the same rainy climate pattern that lay downthe sediments on top of the bedrock sculptures at Nabta Playa.When I first considered the astronomy of Nabta Playa, I approached theinterpretation of the Calendar Circle purely as an astronomical puzzle,unfettered by preconceived notions of what the ancient people at the site“should” have been doing. My interpretation involves only “naked eye” astronomy,easily visible to any visitor with only the unaided eye. Similarly, thealignments of megaliths with stars rising over the eastern horizon involve onlynaked eye observations. The puzzle solution for the bedrock sculpture, “shapedlike a mushroom” under CSA, however, produced something amazing. Working withthe original archaeological drawings made by the excavators, and assuming thatCSA is the centerpiece of all the alignments (and that it may have symbolizedthe astronomical center), it occurred to me that the disk-like, mushroom shaperoughly resembled the shape of our Milky Way galaxy, and that the location ofCSA approximated Earth’s position in it. Furthermore, the “cowstone” sculpturewas found wedged in place on top of the bedrock sculpture, its outer surfacesculpted and polished into what appeared to be a cross-section of a sphere. Aswell, its sides were wedge-shaped such that its placement appeared to angle backto Earth’s location in the galaxy sculpture as a sort of symbolic viewing windowto subtend the area of the sky that the center of the Milky Way galaxy transitsthrough.Now if we stop and ask ourselves whether this was, in fact, what thesesculptures represented if the people who built them only had naked eyeastronomy, the answer is “probably not.” But is it still possible? Perhaps. TheMilky Way is a prominent feature in the sky. It is possible that some Neolithicgenius sky-watchers realized that the Milky Way was a giant structure of whichthe Earth and sun were just a small part. A facility with the rudiments ofgeometry could have yielded the notion that the Milky Way was a disk-shapedstructure (which it is). And it’s entirely possible that these ancient observersof the heavens could have intuited from the anisotropy (variation) within theMilky Way that Earth must have been somewhere significantly off center in thatdisk (which it is). Some researchers suggest that the gleaming white outerstones of the mound at Newgrange were intended as symbolic representations ofthe Milky Way, so the idea that these Neolithic peoples at Nabta Playa couldhave represented the Milky Way with a stone disk is not that far-fetched. Butcould our hypothetical Neolithic geniuses at Nabta Playa have pinpointed Earth’slocation in the galactic disk so accurately? Probably not. The center of thegalaxy is not visible to the naked eye because it is obscured by a dark patch ofdust clouds (although that dark patch did have ritual significance in someancient cultures). So, if these ancient geniuses guessed that this prominentdark patch was also the locus of the center of the galactic disk, and if theyhappened to guess correctly about how far Earth was from that center, they mayhave been able to map it onto their bedrock sculpture. But this scenario isunlikely. So why go through such a useless mental exercise, you ask? For onething, it sharpens one’s thinking skills. And clearly there is still much wedon’t know about our Neolithic ancestors; completely unfettered thinking andproblem-solving may just generate some insight.So if we continue our astronomical puzzle-matching for the bedrock sculptures,next we need to consider the bedrock sculpture under Complex Structure B (CSB)the second biggest complex structure and companion to CSA. The CSB bedrocksculpture is an odd, lumpy, tilted oval shape bigger than the CSA bedrocksculpture (CSB is about 19 feet across, to CSA’s 12 feet). So, if we suspenddisbelief and consider that CSA is a representation of the Milky Way, theobvious conclusion is that CSB represents our galaxy’s much bigger companionnearby, the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy as seen from Earth is atilted oval or ellipse, and its distance from us (measured in galacticdiameters) is roughly analogous to CSB’s distance from CSA on the bedrock. Couldthese Neolithic sky-watchers have mapped the Andromeda galaxy using onlynaked-eye observation? The Andromeda galaxy is visible to the naked eye;normally it resembles a star, although a Persian astronomer misidentified it asa small cloud as early as AD 964. But there is no way for the unaided observerto estimate the actual dimensions of the Andromeda galaxy relative to the MilkyWay galaxy. In The Origin Map, I continued my puzzle-solving, identifying otherastronomical correspondences for the megalithic structures. However, despite astatement made by Malville et al. that I “propose[d] that the nomads had contactwith extra-galactic aliens,”15 [ch14.html#ch14not15] I did not. I did, however,note that the curious sequence of astronomical facts coincided with themegalithic features. I also noted that the knowledge of how to create suchstructures, if the correspondence was indeed intentional, must have beenacquired in one of three ways: 1) it was some method with which we are notfamiliar or facile today (such as remote viewing); 2) it was gleaned throughsome kind of technology similar to our own but which has since disappeared fromhistory; or 3) it was acquired from some outside source, such as contact with“aliens” or inheritance from a much earlier lost civilization.Suffice it to say that no matter how conservative or far-out one’s thinking isabout the past, the true mysteries of Nabta Playa remain. That is why scientistsand laypeople alike are trying to glean more data about what is really on thebedrock there. Rosen and I began to collaborate on using space-based,ground-penetrating imaging techniques to investigate the mystery of the bedrocksculptures. We have been limited to space-based remote sensing attempts becausewe can do it without the onerous barrier of getting permission.Ground-penetrating radar satellite technology isn’t quite advanced enough yet toenable us to see the bedrock features at Nabta, but someday it will be. NabtaPlaya provided a keystone in our knowledge chain that traces the ancestors ofthe pharaohs back in time and space to a culture that thrived in the regionbefore it became a desert wasteland. Perhaps, as our own space age progresses,we will find out some astonishing things about our very ancient past, andtherefore our own future, as well.NOTES1 [ch14.html#ch14not1a].

Malville, J. et al., 2007."},{"pageContent":"THE TIME MACHINESBy Erich von DänikenTranslated by Christian von ArnimOne of the most significant of all the ancient puzzles lies in the land of theNile, the location of the Great Pyramid of the Pharaoh Cheops. We know verylittle of who Cheops was or when he lived. It is thought that he started tobuild the giant structure sometime around 2551 BC. How he accomplished this featremains just as much a mystery as the man himself. Not one craftsman, priest,architect, or pharaoh recorded as much as a single word about the constructionof the Great Pyramid.1 [ch15.html#ch15not1] As well, no inscriptions, such asthe Pyramid Texts found at Saqqara, have ever been found in the Pyramid ofCheops. The structure is a mute symbol of anonymity and mystery.The best-known model that explains the construction of the pyramids is thewooden sledge. It is thought that laborers moved the large and heavy stoneblocks on wooden sledges, which in turn rested on and slid along a wooden base.2[ch15.html#ch15not2] Although this is possible, it doesn’t seem likely. Wood wasvery rare (and still is) in this part of Egypt, and wood on a soft substratesuch as sand splinters easily. Furthermore, there had to have been ropes used inthis process, but nobody knows what sorts of ropes were used or what theirtensile strength was. At what point would the logs have cracked or the ropedsnapped? At three tons? Five tons? We do not know that, either. Like detectivesat the scene of a crime, we can only take what clues are available to us,reconstruct the imagined scenario, reflect on it, and search for possiblesolutions.The most reasonable solution—up until now, at least—is that a ramp was used tomove the stones into place. That said, such a ramp would had to have been threekilometers long, given the position of the building site relative to the Nile,where the stones were brought in on boats. This means that the ramp would havebeen 147 meters high at its highest point, and many times the volume of thepyramid itself.3 [ch15.html#ch15not3] Furthermore, the incline of such a rampwould had to have been consistent through its entire length. It would have beenimpossible to build steps into it, for example. Each increase in height of theramp had to extend over its whole length. A constant height adjustment over thewhole length—week for week! Others assert that a ramp running all the way downto the Nile was not required, and that it could have been accomplished with aspiraling ramp running around the sides of pyramid. This is possible, but itwould have to have been a very wide ramp, indeed, because several sledges wouldhave been moving past one another at the same time—those going up and thosegoing down. This ramp also would have had a volume many times that of thepyramid.Aside from the sheer logistics of building such a ramp—let alone the pyramiditself—there are other factors to consider, such as the peculiar mathematicaland geometrical measurements and correspondences associated with the structure.These include the following:• The pyramid is aligned precisely with the four cardinal points.• The pyramid lies at the center of earth’s land mass.• The meridian running through the pyramid divides the oceans and the continentsinto two equal parts. This north-south meridian is also the meridian thatcrosses the most land on the whole globe.• The three pyramids of Giza are arranged in a Pythagorean triangle, the sidesof which are in a perfect 3:4:5 ratio.• The pyramid is essentially a giant sundial. The shadows thrown frommid-October to early March indicate the seasons and the length of the year. Thelength of the stone slabs surrounding the pyramid correspond perfectly to thelength of the shadow of one day.• The length of each side of the square base is 365.342 Egyptian cubits. Thisnumber is identical to the number of days in the tropical solar year.• The distance of the Great Pyramid from the center of the earth is exactly thesame as its distance from the North Pole.The inside of this monumental structure is no less of a mystery. We know of onlya few passages and chambers—the Queen’s Chamber and, above it, the King’sChamber, for example—and the total volume of these chambers and passages wasonce thought to comprise just one percent of the total volume of the pyramid.Why build such a mighty building if only one percent of the space was going toused?To answer this question, a team of scientists from Waseda University in Tokyocame to investigate the structure.4 [ch15.html#ch15not4] Among the advancedequipment they brought with them included a device to x-ray the stones. Theydiscovered that at least three percent of the content of the pyramid was hollow,not one percent as was originally thought. A French team of scientists achievedan even more startling result using the most modern equipment available. Theyfound that at least 15 percent of the volume of the pyramid is hollow. Asscientists and laypeople alike continue to investigate this enigmatic structure,what other secrets will it reveal? Will new passages and chambers be opened upto the light of day? Will there be any new messages encoded in the structureitself or contained within its walls? Will it ever throw any light on oursupposed contact with the ancient masters? As strange an idea as this may sound,that is precisely what is claimed in some ancient Arab traditions.Herodotus is the only classical historian to name Chufu (Cheops) as the builderof this pyramid (in his Account of Egypt). He admits that this is second-handinformation, given to him by someone else, but then goes on to assert that11,340 years ago (from his time), “the gods ruled in Egypt and lived with humanbeings…. The Egyptians are absolutely sure of that because they havecontinuously counted and written down the years.”5 [ch15.html#ch15not5] No otherhistorian refers specifically to any Cheops or Chufu. Diodorus of Sicily namesChemmis as the builder,6 [ch15.html#ch15not6] and while Pliny the Elderexpressly lists all the names of the historians who have reported before himabout the pyramids, he drily notes, “But none of them can name the actualbuilder.”7 [ch15.html#ch15not7] The most important geographer and encyclopedistof Arabia, Al-Mas’udi (895– 956) names an antediluvian (before the Flood) kingnamed Saurid as builder of the Great Pyramid. Taqi al-Din Ahmad ibn ‘Ali ibn‘Abd alQadir ibn Muhammad al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) does, as well. In his workHitat, al-Maqrizi presents various manuscripts and fragments concerning itsconstruction:The teacher Ibrahim Ben Wasif Sah Al-Katib says in News from Egypt and itsWonders, where he tells of Saurid…one of the kings of Egypt before the Flood…hewas the builder of the Great Pyramid at Misr…. When King Saurid ben Sahluk died,he was buried in the eastern pyramid, Hugib in the western one and Karuras inthe pyramid which is built at the base with stones from Aswan and on top withKaddan stones.8 [ch15.html#ch15not8]Al-Maqrizi also notes that the reason for building all three of the pyramids wasthe coming Flood, and that they contained several chambers filled with booksconcerning all that was known of the sciences before the Flood. The builder,Saurid, was the same person whom the Hebrews called Henoch, and others, Hermes.Muhammad ben Abdallah ben Abd al-Hakam states more precisely: “In my opinion thepyramids can only have been built before the Flood; because if they had beenbuilt afterwards, people would have knowledge about them.”Virtually every historian who visited ancient Egypt (Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny,Strabo, and so on) told of gods who visited the earth a long time ago, and fromwhom the human race had received its original knowledge. Were any identifyingtraces of these gods and the knowledge they imparted preserved on or insidethese monstrous structures? Are there perhaps any older, Stone Age structuresthat can also speak to this dark period, to which so many of the ancienthistorians alluded? One of these oft-misunderstood complexes is located inmodern-day England. Stonehenge lies in the south of the British isles near thetown of Salisbury. The complex consists of giant stones arranged in a circle,and more circles further out (marked with holes), and further out still, largercircles. Stonehenge stretches far back into the past.9 [ch15.html#ch15not9]Construction likely commenced sometime around 3100 BC. Clever priests, who werealso fledgling astronomers, had by that time already started observing theheavens. In their observations, they noted that the moon, the sun, and certainstars rose at very specific times. It is thought that they memorialized theseobservations by marking them somehow on the ground, possibly with ropes or smallstones, because one thing is quite certain—at that time, 5,100 years ago, therewas no writing. But what is perhaps most baffling is that the Stone Age plannerswere able to think abstractly. Who were these planners in the Neolithic age,these builders who, against all odds, were able to look far into the future? Andthen there is the final question that never lets me go: Why did they do whatthey did? Is the whole thing really only a calendar? As of this writing, thattheory has for all intents and purposes been discounted. You certainly do notneed a gigantic complex of megaliths to predict or mark the seasons!We will likely never be able to know the answers to these questions. But in hisefforts to try, the British astronomer Gerald Hawkins fed a total of 7,140different possible combinations into a computer.10 [ch15.html#ch15not10] Hewanted to find out which combinations occurred so far outside the realm ofprobability that they were random. Stonehenge turned out to be the onlyplanetary and interstellar observatory. Of course this was subsequentlydisputed. Some academics came along and found things to criticize in theprofessor’s algorithms.11 [ch15.html#ch15not11] Nevertheless there stillremained more than 40 ways of looking at the matter which clearly indicated thatstructure was meant to mark astronomical reference points. What could such anastronomical center be used for?On June 21, the summer solstice, the sun rises precisely over the so-called heelstone, a monolith that stands outside the primary complex. The sun moves betweenthe gates and grows ever larger, brighter, and more dazzling. On December 21 asimilar thing occurs. It almost looks as though the sun stops for a brief momentbetween the two blocks before continuing to rise and illuminate the cold wintersky. The key factor here is the interplay of light and shadow among themonoliths. A similar spectacle can be observed during moonrise and moonset, asthe light of Diana bathes the earth, albeit much less strongly. The phases ofthe moon are easily observed with the naked eye, so there is no way that thepriests could not have known about these seasonal cycles and these interplays oflight and shadow.And there is something else. Consider the basic structure of our solar system:The sun lies at the center, followed by Mercury, Venus, Earth, and so on, withtheir concentric elliptical paths around the sun. Thanks to the invention of themodern telescope, this model is well-known to most every person on earth. Theastronomer Mike Saunders, noticing the obvious that everyone else missed, foundthat Stonehenge is actually a scaled-down model of our solar system.12[ch15.html#ch15not12] However, this rough megalithic model only represents theaverage distances between trajectories, rather than the elliptical ones. At thecenter with the innermost ring is the sun, then the second ring is Mercury, thethird is Venus, and the fourth is Earth. Further out lies the ring for Mars.There is a vast distance between Mars and Jupiter, which is where the hundredsof thousands of rocks making up the asteroid belt are located. The heel stone,which lies still further out, away from the other markers, marks the distance tothe trajectory of Jupiter.All of this is very extraordinary and must have been purposeful. However, it canhardly be assumed that Stone Age peoples were aware of the data for the averagetrajectories of our solar system. Where did they learn this information, andwhat were the intentions of their teachers, whoever they were? The Russiangeologist Dr. Vladimir Tjurin-Avinsky suspects that Stonehenge was a kind ofexamination question meant for future generations.13 [ch15.html#ch15not13] Inthis sense, it, like the pyramid complex in Egypt, is a time machine with apurpose, but what purpose that is remains to be seen.NOTES1 [ch15.html#ch15not1a].

(2005), Discovering theMysteries of Ancient America (2005), Opening the Ark of the Covenant (2007), andUnearthing Ancient America (2008), all published by New Page Books. His latestoffering, The Untold Story of Ancient America, is due for release in spring of2012.After completing his education at Southern Illinois University’s School ofJournalism, he was a reporter for several Chicago-area publications, includingthe Winnetka Paper. Later, Joseph was the marketing director at Galde Press,Inc., in Lakeville, Minnesota, and published dozens of feature articles and bookreviews in Fate magazine from 1989 to 2009. He served as the editor in chief ofAncient American magazine for 14 years, from its inception in 1993, and iscurrently a feature writer for the Barnes Review and Atlantis Rising. His seriesof four Internet broadcast interviews with Shirley MacLaine were among dozens ofsimilar appearances he has made on Coast-to-Coast AM with Art Bell, The JeffRense Show, Erskine Overnight, 21st-Century Radio, The Whitley Strieber Show,and others.A member of Chicago’s Underwater Archaeology Society and the Oriental Instituteof the University of Chicago, Joseph is a veteran scuba diver with hundreds ofsub-surface dives, from the Aegean Sea and Canary Islands to the Bahamas andPolynesia. Since 1983, he has traveled regularly to Asia, Europe, North Africa,and Central and South America, collecting research for his investigation of lostcivilizations.A frequent guest speaker across the United States, Joseph has also lectured inBritain, the Balkans, and Japan, where he was given the honorific title ofProfessor of World Archaeology by the Savant Institute in 2002. Earlier hereceived the Victor Moseley Award from Ohio’s Midwest Epigraphic Society, theBurrows Cave Society Award, and recognition from the Ancient American ArtifactPreservation Foundation “for generous contributions to the diffusion ofknowledge, exploration and expertise in the area of research into the mysteriesof Ancient America.”Frank Joseph lives with his wife, Laura, and their Norwegian forest cat, Sammy,in the Upper Mississippi River Valley.Oberon Zell is a renowned Wizard and Elder in the worldwide magickal community.He holds academic degrees in sociology, anthropology, clinical psychology,teaching, and theology. He is an initiate in several different magickaltraditions, and has been involved in the founding of several major groups andalliances. In 1962, Oberon cofounded the Church of All Worlds, a Pagan churchwith a futuristic vision. First to apply the terms “Pagan” and “Neo-Pagan” tothe newly emerging Nature religions of the 1960s, and through his publication ofthe award-winning Green Egg magazine, Oberon was instrumental in the coalescenceof the Neo-Pagan movement, which for the past half-century has been reclaimingthe religious heritage of pre-Christian Europe. In 1970, Oberon had a profoundVision of the Living Earth, which he published as an early version of the GaeaThesis—that our entire planetary biosphere comprises the body of a single, vastliving organism universally identified as “Mother Earth.”Oberon is a thealogian and ritualist, creating and conducting rites of passage,seasonal celebrations, mystery initiations, earth healings, and other largerituals. He has traveled throughout the world, celebrated solar eclipses atancient stone circles, raised living unicorns, and swum with mermaids in theCoral Sea. He also designs jewelry and sculpts figurines of gods, goddesses, andmythical creatures for the Mythic Images Collection (www.mythicimages.com[http://www.mythicimages.com]).In 2002, Oberon gathered together many respected mages and sages to form theGrey Council. In 2004, Oberon and the Council published Grimoire for theApprentice Wizard, filled with their accumulated wisdom and insights.
