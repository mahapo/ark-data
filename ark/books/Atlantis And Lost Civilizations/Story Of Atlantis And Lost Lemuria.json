The world at lar ge is thus at pr esent so imper fectly alive to the r e- sour ces of human faculty, that by most peo- ple as yet, the very existence, even as a poten- tiality, of psychic powers, which some of us all the while ar e consciously exer cising every day,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"http:// booksiread.org 5 is scor nfully denied and derided.

The maximum cultivation of which the human intellect is sus- ceptible while it denies itself all the r esour ces of its higher spiritual consciousness, can never be mor e than a pr eparatory pr ocess as compar ed with that which may set in when the faculties ar e suf ficiently enlar ged to enter into conscious r elationship with the super -physical planes or aspects of Natur e.

Geologists have in some cases been able to specify the ex- act portions of the earth’s sur face wher e these subsidences and upheavals have taken place, and although the lost continent of Atlantis has so far r eceived scant r ecognition fr om the world of science, the general concensus of opinion has for long pointed to the existence, at some pr ehistoric time, of a vast souther n continent to which the name of Lemuria has been assigned.
