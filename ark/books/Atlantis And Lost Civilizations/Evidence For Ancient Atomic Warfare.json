Brandon relat es that \"Deat h Vall ey Sco tty\", an ecc entric who spent million s buil ding a cast le-est ate in the area, was kno wn to go \"pr ospect ing\" when funds ran low. Death Valle y Scot ty wou ld che ck out for a few days of wande ring in the nearby Grape vine Mountai ns, bringing back suspic iously refin ed-loo king gold that he cla imed he had prospe cted. Many believe that he got his gold from the stacked gold bars in the tunnel syste m bene ath Death Valley. Evid ence of a lost civ ilisat ion in Death Valle y came in a bizarr e repo rt of caves and mum mies in the Hot Citizen, a Nev ada paper, on Augu st 5, 1947 . The story ran as follo ws: EXPE DITION REPOR TS NIN E-FOOT SKELE TONS A band of amateu r arch aeolog ists announc ed tod ay the y have disco vered a lost civil izatio n of men nin e feet tall in Cal iforni an cav erns. Howard E. Hill , spok esman for the expe dition , said the civiliz ation may be \"the fabl ed los t cont inent of Atl antis\" . The caves contai n mumm ies of men and ani mals and imp lement s of a cultu re 80,0 00 yea rs old but \"in som e resp ects more advanced than ours,\" Hill said . He said the 32 caves covered a 180 -squar e-mile area in Cal iforni a's Deat h Vall ey and south ern Nevada. ARCH AEOLOG ISTS SKEPTIC AL \"Thi s disc overy may be more import ant than the unvei ling of King Tut's tomb ,\" he said. Profes sional archa eologi sts were ske ptical of Hill's stor y. Los Angel es Cou nty Museum scienti sts pointed out that din osaurs and tige rs whi ch Hil l said lay side by side in the caves appea red on Earth 10,0 00,000 to 13,000,0 00 yea rs apa rt. Hill sai d the caves were discove red in 1931 by Dr F.

The last commen t abou t cook ing food wit h radi o wave s bein g unbe lievab le is ironic . That is the one thing that modern reader s of the stor y coul d cert ainly believ e was true, consid ering the widespre ad use of micr owave ovens today. Who had hea rd of them in 1947 ? Sodo m and Gomorr ah mee t Hiro shima and Nagasaki Prob ably the mos t famo us of all ancient \"nuke 'em\" stories is the well -known bibli cal tale of Sodom and Gomorrah : And the Lord sai d, Bec ause the cry of Sodom and Gomo rrah is grea t, and because their sin is very grievous Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and � upon Gomor rah, brimsto ne and fire from the Lor d out of hea ven; And he over threw those cities , and all the plai n, and all the inh abitan ts of the citi es, and that which grew upon the gro und. But his [Lot' s] wif e look ed back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt And lo, the smoke � of the cou ntry went up as the smok e of a furna ce. (Genesis 18:20 ; 19:2 4-26,2 8) This bibli cal passage has come to epitom ise the dest ructiv e powe r of God's wrat h visi ted on those place s whic h sin. The Bible is very speci fic about the site of Sodo m and Gomorr ah plu s seve ral other towns; they were in the Vale of Siddim, which was located at the south ern end of the Sal t Sea (now call ed the Dead Sea). Other towns in the area, accor ding to the Bible, were Zoar, Admah and Zeboiim (Gene sis 14:2). As late as the Midd le Age s, a town calle d Zoar exist ed in the area. The Dead Sea is 1,293 feet [394 metres] below sea level and at least 1,200 feet [365 m] dee p. The botto m of the sea is therefor e abou t 2,50 0 feet [762 m] below the leve l of the Med iterra nean. Approx imatel y 25 per cen t of the water of the Dead Sea consists of solid ingredie nts, mostly sodium chlo ride. Normal ocean water is around 4.6 per cent salt. The Jordan and many small er riv ers empty themselv es int o this basin , whic h has no soli tary outlet. What its tributar ies bring to it in the way of chemic al subs tances remai n depo sited in the Dead Sea's 500 square miles. Evap oratio n unde r the broili ng sun takes place on the surf ace of the sea at a rate of ove r 230 millio n cubi c feet per day. Arab tra dition has it that so many poi sonous gases come out of the lake that bir ds cou ld not fly acro ss it, as they wou ld die befor e reac hing the oth er sid e. The Dead Sea was first explo red in moder n time s in 1848 when W. F. Lyn ch, an America n geol ogist, led an expe dition . He brought ashor e from his gove rnment resea rch ship two metal boats which he fastened onto larg e-whee led carts. Pulled by a long team of horses , his expedi tion reac hed the Dead Sea some months later. Lynch and his team disco vered that the tradit ions were correct in tha t a man coul d not sink in the sea. They also surve yed the lake , noti ng its unusu al dep th and the shallow area or \"ton gue\" at the southe rn end of the lake . This area is tho ught to be where the Vale of Sidd im was locat ed and the five cities existed . It is poss ible to see ent ire forests of tre es enc rusted with salt beneath the water in this south ern part of the lake. Stan dard histori cal theory on the destru ction of Sod om and Gomor rah, such as in The Bible As His tory by Wern er Kel ler,18 holds that the cities of the Vale of Sidd im wer e dest royed when a plate movem ent caused the Gre at Rift Valle y--of which the Dead Sea is a part- -to shi ft, and the area at the southe rn end of the Dead Sea to subs ide. In the great earthq uake there were proba bly explosio ns, natural gases issuin g fort h and brimst one fall ing like rai n. Thi s is likely to hav e happ ened about 2000 BC, the time of Abraham and Lot, thinks Keller, thoug h geol ogists place the event many thou sands of yea rs bef ore this. Says Kel ler:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The Jordan Valle y is only part of a huge fract ure in the Earth's crust . The path of this crack has meantim e been accur ately traced . It begins far nort h, sev eral hundred miles beyon d the border s of Palesti ne, at the foot of the Tau rus mountain s in Asia Minor. In the south it run s from the south shor e of the Dea d Sea throug h the Wadi el-Arab ah to the Gulf of Aqabah and only comes to an end beyond the Red Sea in Afr ica. At many point s in this vast depre ssion, signs of intense volcan ic act ivity are obvious. In the Gali lean mountai ns, in the highlan ds of Transj ordan, on the bank s of the Jabb ok, a tribut ary of the Jordan, and on the Gulf of Aqab ah are black basa lt and lava. .. The subsid ence release d volc anic forces that had bee n lyin g dorm ant, deep down along the whole length of the fract ure. In the upper valley of the Jord an nea r Bash an the re are still the towerin g crat ers of extin ct volc anoes; great stret ches of lava and deep layers of basa lt hav e been depo sited on the limes tone surface . From time immemo rial the are a arou nd this depre ssion has been sub ject to eart hquake s. The re is repeat ed evid ence of them and the Bib le its elf records them.. . Did Sodom and Gomorrah sink when perhaps a par t of the bas e of this huge fiss ure collapse d stil l furt her to the accompa niment of earthqua kes and volc anic eruptio ns? As for the pilla rs of salt, Keller says: To the wes t of the sou thern shore and in the directi on of the Biblical \"Lan d of the Sou th\", the Neg eb, stretche s a ridge of hills about 150 feet high and 10 mile s from north to south. Their slopes sparkl e and glitte r in the sunshi ne lik e diam onds. It is an odd pheno menon of nat ure. For the most part this little range of hil ls con sists of pur e rock salt. The Arabs call it Jebel Usdum, an anci ent name, which preserve s in it the word \"Sod om\". Many blocks of salt have been worn away by the rain and have cras hed downhill . They have odd shapes and som e of them stand on end, look ing like sta tues. It is easy to imag ine them sud denly seemin g to come to life. Thes e stra nge statues in sal t remi nd us vividl y of the Bib lical desc riptio n of Lot's wife who was turned into a pill ar of salt.. . And ever ything in the neig hbourh ood of the Salt Sea is even to this day quic kly covered with a crust of salt. Howe ver, Keller himsel f admi ts tha t ther e is a very seriou s prob lem with this theor y of a catac lysm sending the Vale of Siddi m to the bot tom of the Dead Sea: it mus t have happe ned many hun dreds of tho usands , even milli ons, of years ago-- at least accor ding to most geolo gists. Says Keller : In particu lar, we must remem ber there can be no ques tion that the Jord an fiss ure was form ed bef ore about 4000 BC. Indee d, acc ording to the most rece nt pre sentat ion of the facts, the origin of the fissur e date s back to the Oligoc ene, the thi rd old est stage of the Tertiar y peri od. We thus have to think in term s not of tho usands , but of mil lions of yea rs. Violent volc anic activit y conn ected with the Jor dan fissure has been sho wn to have occu rred since then, but eve n so we do not get any further than the Plei stocen e whic h came to an end approxi mately ten thousan d year s ago. Cert ainly we do not come any where near to the third, still less the second mill ennium befor e Chri st-- the peri od, that is to say , in which the patr iarchs are traditi onally place d. In short, Keller is saying that any geol ogical catas trophe that would have dest royed Sodom and Gomorrah would have had to have happen ed a million year s ago, or so geolo gists have told him. Kel ler says tha t geol ogists have not found any evi dence of a recent catast rophe at the south ern end of the Dead Sea, at least not for abo ut 10, 000 years. Says Keller: In additio n, it is pre cisely to the sout h of the Lis an pen insula , wher e Sodo m and Gomorr ah are repor ted to have been annihil ated, that the tra ces of former volcan ic act ivity cease. In short, the pro of in this area of a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" quit e rece nt cat astrop he whi ch wip ed out towns and was acc ompani ed by viol ent volcanic activ ity is not provide d by the fin dings of the geol ogists . So here is the problem : the Dead Sea are a may have had a catacly sm tha t coul d be the ori gin of the Old Tes tament story ; howe ver, conserv ative unif ormita rian geologi sts have sai d that any such Earth changes must have occu rred long before any sor t of collect ive memory of the event. In late 1999, a new theory was pro posed by Bri tish Bible scholar Micha el Sand ers and an interna tional team of res earche rs who , afte r seve ral frau ght weeks of divin g in a mini- submar ine, discove red what app ears to be the salt- encrust ed rem ains of anci ent settleme nts on the seabed. Sande rs told a tel evisio n crew from BBC/Ch annel 4 who were making a docu mentar y abou t the expedi tion: Ther e is a good chance that these mounds are coverin g up brick structu res and are one of the los t citi es of the plains, possib ly eve n Sodo m or Gomo rrah, though I wou ld hav e to examine the evidenc e. The se Bib le sto ries were hande d down by word of mouth from generat ion to gener ation before they were writte n down , and there seems to be a grea t deal in this one . Sand ers had unea rthed a map dating from 1650, which reinfo rced his bel ief that the sites of the two cities could be unde r the northe rn bas in rat her than on the sout hern edge of the Dead Sea. He recrui ted Richard Slater , an Amer ican geologi st and exper t in deep- sea divi ng, to take him to the dept hs of the Dead Sea in the two- man Delta mini-sub marine that was invo lved in the discov ery of the sunken ocean- liner, the Lusitan ia. Sand ers's locati on for Sodom and Gomorra h, in the deep nor thern part of the Dead Sea, is even more at odds with histor y and geolog y than Kelle r's theo ry of the cities being at the shallo w sout hern end. Ther efore we com e back to the popu lar theory that these cities were not dest royed in a geologi cal cataclys m but in a man-mad e (or extr aterre strial -made) apoca lypse that was tec hnolog ical in natu re. Were Sodo m and Gomorr ah att acked with atomic weapon s, as Hirosh ima and Naga saki were ? Rese archer L. M. Lewis , in his boo k Foot prints on the Sand s of Time,19 main tains that both Sodom and Gomo rrah were destroye d by atomic weapon s and that the sal t pill ars and high salt conten t arou nd the Dead Sea are evid ence of a nuclear blast. Says Lewis: When Hiros hima was bei ng reb uilt, stretc hes of sandy soil were found to have been atomic ally changed into a subs tance resemb ling a glaze d sili con perm eated by a saline crysta lloid. Littl e bloc ks of this were cut from the mass and sold to touri sts as souve nirs of the town- -and of atomi c acti on. Had an eve n larg er exp losion pulve rized every stone of eve ry bui lding- -and had the complete city disapp eared into thin air--the re wou ld sti ll hav e been tell- tale indicat ions of what had occurre d on the out skirts of the area of devastat ion. At some point s ther e woul d sure ly be a mark ed diff erence in the soil or an atomi c chan ge in some object of not e. Lewi s main tains that if the pillar s of salt at the end of the Dead Sea were ordin ary salt, they wou ld hav e disa ppeare d with the periodi c rain s. Inst ead, these pillars are of a special, harde r salt , only creat ed in a nucl ear reaction such as an atomic explo sion. Thes e pill ars of salt have indeed lasted a lon g time . Not only were they pres ent in ancie nt tim es, but are still standi ng tod ay. Lewis quotes from the histor ian Josephus , who says in his Histor y of the Jew s: but Lot's wife, continually turning back to view the city as she went � from it, althoug h God had forbidde n her so to do, was chan ged into a pill ar of salt; for I have seen it, and it rem ains to this day.

As pre viousl y stat ed, Sodom was disi ntegra ted in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 1898 BC. How ama zing, then, that Josephu s shou ld act ually have seen the huma n \"pil lar of salt\" after it had stoo d for almost 2,000 years ! If it had been ordinar y salt , it would have disappea red with the first rains . Ther e may have been many pil lars of salt throu ghout histor y, but Lewis thin ks the evide nce supports an atomic blast: The atomic chang e of the soi l upon which Lot's wife stood and that of the shor e of Hiroshi ma hav e a similari ty tha t cann ot be denied ! Both had unde rgone a sudd en ato mic conversi on whi ch cou ld onl y have been caused by the instan t acti on of nuclea r fiss ion. As thos e thin gs whi ch equ al the same thing must be equ al to one another, it is diffi cult to esca pe the conv iction that as Hir oshima was destroy ed, so, by similar means , Sodo m was disint egrate d and Lot's wife at the same moment atomic ally changed . Rely ing on the veracit y of Josephu s, the only conclu sion that can be reac hed is that Sodom was destroye d by nuclear fissi on. The story of Sod om and Gomor rah is puzzl ing not just becau se of the dest ructio n but also because of the pers onalit ies involved , such as the ange l warn ing Lot to leave the doo med cities. Was Lot warn ed bef orehan d that the cities were going to be \"nuked\" by extrater restri als or human s with high- tech weapons ? Lot was warned to get his family out, but his wife look ed bac k and was blinded by the atomi c flas h. Per haps her bod y was even atom ically chang ed.

Dur ing the day it loo ks lik e an oil ref inery or some thing simila r, but at night the ligh ts tha t are strung about the faci lity make it seem otherw orldly . This huge chemic al pla nt is said to have an endless supply of valuable miner als, includi ng rad ioacti ve sal ts, with which to work. Are some of these chemical s the result of an ancie nt atom ic bla st? Atom ic War in Ancient India Thes e vers es are from the Mahabhar ata (written in ancient Dravid ian, then late r in Sanskri t) and descr ibe horrific wars fought long before the reco rder's lifet ime. Various omens appeared among the gods: winds blew, meteors fell in � thou sands, thund er rol led through a clou dless sky.

Seve ral historic al rec ords claim that Indian culture has been around for lite rally tens of thou sands of yea rs. Yet, unt il 192 0, all the \"expert s\" agre ed tha t the origin s of the Ind ian civilisa tion should be pla ced within a few hund red years of Alexa nder the Gre at's expedit ion to the subc ontine nt in 327 BC. Howe ver, that was befo re sev eral great cities like Hara ppa and Mohe njo- Daro (Mo und of the Dead), Kot Diji, Kalibang a and Loth al wer e disc overed and excavat ed. Lothal, a form er por t city now miles from the ocean, was discover ed in Gujara t, wes tern India, just in the late 20th centu ry.20 These discov eries have forced archae ologis ts to push back the dates for the orig in of Indian civil isatio n by thousan ds of years- -in line with what the Ind ians themsel ves have ins isted all along. A wonder to mode rn-day resea rchers , the cities were highly devel oped and adva nced. The way that each city was lai d out in reg ular blocks, with stre ets crossing each other at rig ht ang les and the entire city laid out in section s, giv es arc haeolo gists cause to bel ieve that the citi es wer e conc eived as a whole before they were built- -a remar kable early exampl e of city plann ing. Even more rem arkabl e is that the plum bing/s ewage system s thro ughout the large cities were so soph istica ted- -superio r to those found in Pakista n, Ind ia and many Asian countr ies today. Sewers were covered , and most homes had pri vate toilets and running water . Furt hermor e, the wate r and sewage syste ms wer e kept well separa ted.21 , 22, 23 This advan ced culture had its own writin g, whi ch has never been deci phered . The people used person alised clay seals, much as the Chine se stil l do today, to off iciali se doc uments and letters . Some of the seal s foun d cont ain figures of ani mals that are unkn own to us today, includi ng an extinct form of the Brahm an bul l. Arch aeolog ists really have no idea who the bui lders were, but their atte mpts to date the ruins (which they ascribe to the \"Ind us Val ley civi lisati on\", also called \"Harapp an\") have come up with somethi ng lik e 2500 BC and olde r, but radia tion from the wars appar ently fought in the area may have thrown off the date. The Rama Empire, descr ibed in the Mahabh arata and Ramayana , was suppos edly cont empora neous with the gre at cul tures of Atl antis and Osiris in the West . Atla ntis, well known from Plato's writin gs and ancie nt Egy ptian record s, appa rently exist ed in the mid-Atla ntic and was a hig hly technolo gical and patr iarcha l civi lisati on. The Osiria n civi lisati on exi sted in the Medite rranea n basi n and northe rn Afri ca, accordin g to esoteri c doct rine and arc haeolo gical eviden ce, and is gene rally known as pre -dynas tic Egypt. It was floode d when Atlan tis sank and the Mediterr anean began to fil l up with water. The Rama Empire flouri shed during the same per iod, accordi ng to esoter ic trad ition, fadin g out in the mille nnium after the destruct ion of the Atla ntean contin ent. As noted above, the ancient Indian epics descr ibe a series of horrific wars --wars which could have been fought betwee n anci ent India and Atla ntis, or per haps a third party in the Gobi regio n of western China . The Mahabh arata and the Dron a Parv a spea k of the war and of the weapon s used : grea t fire balls that could destroy a who le cit y; \"Ka pila's Glanc e\", whic h coul d burn 50,00 0 men to ash es in second s; and flyin g spea rs tha t coul d ruin whole \"citi es ful l of forts\".

Acco rding to the Lemur ian Fellowsh ip les son material s, the popul ace surr oundin g Mu (Lemuri a, whi ch pre dated the other civilisa tions) even tually split into two opposing facti ons: those who pri zed practica lity and those who prized spiritu ality.

One accoun t of the bat tle, related by the Lemu rian Fellows hip, tells how the Rama Empire Priest - King s defe ated the Atl antean s. Equ ipped with a form idable force and a \"fant astic array of wea pons\", the Atlante ans landed in their vailixi outsi de one of the Rama citie s, got their troop s in order and sent a messa ge to the ruling Priest- King of the city that he shoul d surr ender. The Priest- King sent word bac k to the Atl antean Gener al: We of Indi a have no quarrel with you of Atlant is. We ask only that we be perm itted to fol low our own way of life. Rega rding the ruler's mild request as a confes sion of weak ness and expe cting an eas y vict ory- - as the Rama Empire did not pos sess the tech nology of war or the agg ressiv eness of the Atlan teans- -the Atlante an Gene ral sent ano ther message : We shall not des troy your land wit h the mighty weapo ns at our command, prov ided you pay suffi cient tribut e and accept the rulersh ip of Atlant is.

And yet, of what else could the Mahabhar ata be speak ing? Perhaps this is just a poe tic way to describ e cave men clubbing each other to dea th; after all, that is wha t we are tol d the ancien t past was like. Until the bom bing of Hiroshi ma and Nagas aki, modern mankin d coul d not imagin e any weapon as horr ible and dev astati ng as those descri bed in the ancient India n text s. Yet they very accurate ly des cribed the effects of an atomi c expl osion. Radi oactiv e pois oning will make hair and nails fall out. Immersi ng one self in water gives some respite, thoug h is not a cure. Inte restin gly, Manhatt an Pro ject chief scienti st Dr J. Rob ert Oppenhei mer was known to be famili ar wit h anci ent Sanskrit liter ature. In an inter view cond ucted after he wat ched the fir st ato mic test, he quote d from the Bhag avad Gita: 'Now I am become Death , the Destro yer of World s.' I suppose we all felt that way. When asked in an inter view at Roch ester Univer sity seven years after the Alam ogordo nucle ar tes t whet her that was the first atomic bomb ever to be deto nated, his reply was: Well , yes, in modern history .25 Grea t Civi lisati ons Meet the ir Doo m Incr edible as it may seem, archaeo logist s have found evide nce in India and Paki stan, indica ting that some cit ies were des troyed in atomic explosi ons.

At one site, Soviet schol ars found a skel eton which had a radioac tive level 50 time s grea ter than nor mal.26 The Russia n arch aeolog ist A. Gorbo vsky mention s the high inciden ce of radi ation associ ated with the skel etons in his 1966 book, Riddle s of Anci ent History. 27 Fur thermo re, thousand s of fused lumps, christ ened \"bla ck sto nes\", have been found at Mohen jo-Dar o.

Huge masse s of walls and fou ndatio ns of the ancient city are fus ed toge ther, litera lly vitrifie d! And since there is no indic ation of a volc anic eruptio n at Mohenjo -Daro or at the other cities, the intense heat to melt clay ves sels can onl y be explain ed by an ato mic blast or some othe r unkn own weapon.2 8, 29, 30 The citi es wer e wipe d out entire ly. If we acce pt the Lemur ian Fellowsh ip sto ries as fact , then Atlan tis wanted to waste no more time with the Pri est- Kings of Rama and their mental tric ks. In terri fying reveng e, the y utte rly destroye d the Rama Empire, leav ing no count ry eve n to pay tri bute to them . The areas around the citi es of Harapp a and Mohenj o-Daro have also been desolate d in the pas t, thou gh agr icultu re tak es pla ce to a limi ted extent in the vicini ty tod ay. It is said in esoteric liter ature that Atlanti s at the sam e time , or shor tly afterwar ds, also att empted to subjugat e a civilisa tion extant in the area of the Gobi Desert, which was then a fertil e plai n. By using so- called scalar wave weapon ry and firin g thro ugh the cent re of the Earth, they wiped out their adversa ries- -and possibly did themsel ves in at the same time! Much specu lation natur ally exists in con nectio n with remot e hist ory. We may never actual ly kno w the comple te tru th, though ancient texts still in exis tence are certainl y a good sta rt. Atla ntis met its own doom, accordi ng to Plato, by sinking into the oce an in a might y cata clysm- -not too lon g afte r the war with the Rama Empire , I imag ine.

Anot her curious sign of an ancient nucle ar war in India is a gia nt cra ter near Bomba y. The nearl y circ ular 2,154- metre- diamete r Lona r crat er, loca ted 400 kilo metres north east of Bomb ay and aged at les s than 50,00 0 year s old, could be related to nuc lear warfare of antiquit y. No trace of any meteor ic mat erial, etc., has been found at the site or in the vici nity, and this is the world's only known \"impact \" crat er in basalt . Indi cation s of great shock (from a press ure exceedin g 600, 000 atmosphe res) and intens e, abr upt heat (in dicate d by basalt glass spheru les) can be asce rtaine d from the site.
