He had just stepped under the shower, when a sharp tingle sent him scurrying to his bedside phone. Pasadena, California. “Martin, there’s been another sighting of the Black Knight. The NASA men are calling for details. Kazantsev in Moscow is pushing for an immediate expedition to the vicinity. We want you back as soon as possible.” Byron set down the receiver. So it w as on again. Not sighted for twenty years. And now...He snatched up the mouthpiece and dialed another number. I was still some fifteen minutes away from Byron’s hotel apartment, which afforded time for reflection. It was, I recalled, in October 1957, that man’s most daring triumph— Sputnik I—had been rocketed suddenly into orbit 584 miles above the earth. With excitement, mingled almost with disbelief, millions worldwide had scanned the night sky to glimpse that shining artificial moon skimming on its path east to west against the canopy of stars. Within four months America had followed suit. So, after aeons of tortoise-paced de velopment, humanity had suddenly leapt off the planet; it was startling—and we were alive to see it! Then came a bizarre discovery. It was hushed up quickly, I recalled. I was now at Byron’s hotel. The ignition key off, I sat, musing. As tracking stations swung into action to monitor these new moons, the night sky had tossed up an awesome mystery. Another satellite was A"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" x discovered already in orbit. Cert ainly it was neither American nor Russian—and the uncanny truth was nobody else had the technology. French astronomer Jacques Valle of the Paris Observatory, saw it three times in 1961 and got eleven data points in forty-five seconds. It seemed to he orbiting in reverse at an altitude of over 22,000 miles above the earth. Experts were jolted. Who put this satellite into orbit? How long had it been there? “I’m glad you could come.” smiled the professor. offering a chair. “Now there’s something for your research. I might say the Russians have the edge on us, in this investiga tion. Lev Gindelis and the Pulkovo Observatory in Leningrad concur that the Black Knight is out there waiting for us to explore its cargo, and God only knows, whatever we find aboard it may change the course of history.” I shuffled intently. ‘So you believe this is an intelligently placed vehicle?” “Well, it’s not a meteor, and you can rule out space junk.” Truly the last twenty-five years had plunged us into some unsettling mysteries concerning our unknown past. I reminded Byron of that day in February 1961—the thirteenth to be precise—when Mike Mikesell, Wallace Lane and Virginia Maxey were exploring 4,300 feet up in California’s Coso Mountains and stumbled upon a fossil-encrusted rock. That in itsel f was not unusual. But wait for this. Expecting it to be a hollow geode stone containing crystals, they broke a diamond saw on it the next day. The su rprise turned wild when, instead of crystals, they found inside the rock a mechanized device resembling a spark plug. A sophisticated relic, if you please. But the riddle was its enormous age. Authorities dated it at half a million years. “Do you see the problem?” I asked. “Even if we dismiss such dating, this mystery object was undeniably far too old to be explained by our conventional theories.” The professor grinned. He was clearly enjoying the puzzle. “Discoveries such as these do pose awkward questions,” he chuckled. “Tell me, Martin, scientifically speakin g, is it possible that things which ought not to exist, do in fact exist? Could there have been a remote era when man-made wonders were as commonplace as they are today?” Gradually the pieces seemed to be fitting together. I was beginning to wonder, what if something very big had happened on this planet in the past—something so big it wiped traces of just about everything from the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" xi face of the earth? Except for a few clues, upon which we were now stumbling? I can imagine what you are thinking at this moment. You are probably intrigued. But skeptical. Right? Prehistoric man could never have produced such things as earth-orbiting satellites and spark plugs. Yes, I know. The nineteenth century evolution theory was hammered into us as schoolchildren and is still taught in all places of learning. The story goes that we ascended from savages to our present civilized state by a slow, uninterrupted development. The question now arises, Could this be a myth? But hasn’t evolution been proved? A good question. The truth is, evolution has always been only a theory . Yes, it is often presented as a fact, even though it is impossible of any really positive proof. Would it surprise you to learn that not in one spot, but all over the world, “impossible” ancient inventions have been surfacing of late, and some of them from a technology as advanced as our own? Did you know that nearly all writings of ancient peoples worldwide tell the same story, that of a decline fro m an original “Golden Age”? That a cataclysmic disaster wiped out the advanced world? Now here is the crunch. Today diggings all over the globe show that these traditions tally with the facts. Enormous stone masses or metal fragments are there; they cannot be argued away. This is tantalizing. Actually, the concept of an original advanced world, which gave impetus to all succeeding civilizations , is well within the framework of scientific thinking. What is more, I belie ve this to be such a credible reality that no longer can we evade it. The story about to unfold concerns a technology whose citizens were rich beyond our dreams. I shall show you how a global Flood minced it to atoms. How subsequent attempts were made to revive the lost glory. And how a fiery holocaust intervening, most of the survivors became savages. It’s time the truth was out. So many theories have been foisted on so many people for so many years. We’ll never know all the facts, but there’s enough to ignite an explosion in conventional circles. And when you consider we’re stripping bare our secret past, our own early days on planet Earth, our very own family history, it grows exciting indeed. I suspect that as the evid ence progressively interlocks, you may sense the swelling excitement of one w ho has suddenly touched down upon some unknown new planet. The discoveries are explained in everyday language in order to kindle interest within the general population. It’s a tale of vast riches—forfeited, forgotten and found."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" xii There is something ominous here. We have, early in the twenty-first century, awakened to find ourselves in th e super culture arena. As we leap to new, unimagined heights, we suddenl y come eyeball to eyeball with our past, awakening to the realizati on that we’ve been here before. Last time, as now, the world scene was overshadowed with violence and corruption. The end was almost total annihilation. One is tempted to ask, Might something like this happen again? Could a holocaust be looming of such proportions that it will parallel the first “wipeout”? We may be better able to evaluate this question at the close of our probe. Meanwhile our excursion into the past offers a feast of hidden delights. Let’s begin."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 1 PART ONE HOW AN ORIGINAL SUPER WORLD VANISHED"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 2"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 3    Chapter 1 THE DAY THE EARTH TIPPED OVER am stormed outside. Anna was such a sucker for cranks. That guy in the news interview? A world wipeout, what rot! Why couldn’t Anna be practical, lik e he was? Sam had built up this market garden from scratch. Sixteen thousand pineapples, the best in the south polar basin. And that clever little blackmail-well, Anna didn’t know about that-but they’d soon be rich. The hoverbus whirred into busy Adah Avenue and disgorged its load outside the Green Pyramid Hotel. Sam’s favorite bar was ablaze with color. Inside, at a corner table, sat an acquaintance from the electronics plant. Sam was still fuming at Anna’s gullibility. He poured out his frustration over a beer. “So I told her, Mal, if a worldwide flood were imminent, surely our top scientists would say so! When has nature let us down? Since time began it’s been so smooth. Natural disasters? Pure fantasy, Mal. They just can’t happen!” “They do,” drawled his companion. “When this mug is empty, that’s a natural disaster.” Sam winced at the flippancy of that remark, and proceeded. “Anna says the end’s coming, Mal. Have you heard anything so naive? That this entire planet, equable and warm from pole to pole, will suddenly change under a flood of water.” Mal peered over his flask. “How?” S"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 4 “Oh, some stupid prophecy about sheets of water crashing from the sky and erupting out of the ground,” Sam snorted. “Religious nonsense. “Perhaps so,” responded Mal. “But you know pal, there is enough water up there and down there.” He jesticulated with his flask. “What do you mean?” Was Sam hearing right? Was Mal a fruitcake too? “Just this, Sam. You know why we have such an excellent climate? Why we have vegetation in such lavi sh exuberance, so wonderfully teeming with animal life?” “Go on.” “It’s that vapour canopy high above th e planet. It filters out harmful cosmic rays and keeps our climate just right. But there’s oceans of water up there- and lots more in the underground basins. If something were to disturb them...” Sam cut in. “Rubbish. I’ll believe it when the first drops fall. Look, most of earth’s surface is not sea, but land, watered since time began-and quite adequately, I might say-by nothing but the gentle morning mist. It’s reliable, I tell you. What can go wrong?” “Maybe if the earth keels over,” quipped Mal. “As I’m about to do.” Sam bit his tongue. It was useless trying to extract sense from his companion tonight. He glanced up at the televiewer. The news was on: With police scanners now in 70 percent of homes, arrests for dissent had risen to six hundred per week. A new planet had been detected beyond Pluto. Hoodlums with a laser gun had decapitated a man on his way home. Apparently he disturbed them during a pack rape. Today a single bomb disintegrated another entire city on the equator. Frightening, all this violence. Almost out of control. Sam felt sick. Some cool night air, that’s what he needed. Sam pushed through the sound-activated doors and onto the street. It was soothing...calm...fresh...He felt better. Leaflets from peace demonstrators littered the pavement. Sam watched, bemused, as one flitted above the street and up the side of the half-completed Jared Building, already towering 300 feet into the darkness. It was partly his, thanks to phot os in safe deposit; blackmailing the corporation chief had been easy; the ma n could ill afford a fraud scandal. Sam smiled; with his stake in the Jared Corporation, he was set for life. And Anna, that silly woman, he wanted her so much, it hurt. Next week was the wedding. A lifetime with her. Suddenly the pavement rocked. Sam was hurled against a guardrail."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 5 He looked up. Massive buildings were swaying. Loud bursts of noise cracked the sky. He stretched out his hand to steady himself. And felt them. SPOTS! Sam fumbled for his neck phone, his face ashen... Something like this was occurring on that final night of the antedeluvian era. If we are to believe later traditions, that is. As for the worldwide greenhouse environment, geology would one day attest to it-as well as to its sudden demise. 1 Traditions would later describe survivors of the Deluge who were like gods-that is, they were members of a superior civilization, which ceased to exist after the Great Flood. Egyptian records would contend that the reign of the “gods” before the First Dynasty was one of superior and miraculous powers. After the Deluge, the Popol Vuh (the sacred book of the Quiche Indians of Guatemala) would record: “The fi rst race of men before the Flood possessed all knowledge; they studied the four quarters of heaven and the round surface of the earth.” 2 Understood in this light, even Greek mythology begins to make some sense. We see it as the recollection by a degenerate race, of a vast, mighty and highly civilized empire, which in a remote past covered the world. Pause for reflection. Can we possibly imagine that all of the peoples of all continents independently invented such a story? Did they all speak of an original Golden Age by chance, without any foundation? Indeed, I am tempted to ask, if man evolved from beasts, then why is it that there existed a long tradition of a Golden Age instead of that of a savage past? Will anyone explain that? Even where there was lack of writin g in conditions of savagery imposed by catastrophe, the same memory of the Golden Ag e was passed from mouth to ear. You may want to ask at this point, can we really place much credence in ancient legends? Surprisingly, a great deal. Too often, I’m afraid, we have been prone to dismiss folklore and mythology out of hand. But is this not unscientific, especially since traditions have often led us to discover physical remains? "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 6 LEGENDS ARE USUALLY BASED ON A CORE OF FACT Pertinently, William Prescott, the great Americanologist, reminds us: “A nation may pass away and leave only the memory of its existence, but the stories of science it has gathered up will endure forever.” 3 You see, folklore is a fossil of history; it preserves history in the guise of colorful tales. Far from being a collection of fables, it is a recital of actual past events, even though from genera tion to generation some facts have become distorted or forgotten. Professor I.A. Efremov, of the Soviet Union, cautions that “historians must pay more respect to ancient traditions and folklore.” He accuses Western scientists of snobbishness in rejecting the tales of the “common people.” 4 We must face it: legends are usually based on a core of fact. Take the legend of Troy. No scholar took The Iliad or The Odyssey of homer as history. But Schliemann, putting faith in it, discovered the “mythical” city of Troy. The Iliad spoke of a cup decorated with doves which Odysseus used. In a shaft Schliemann found that 3,600-year-old cup. Herodotus told a fabulous story of a distant country where griffins guarded a golden treasure. This land (Altai, or Kin Shan) has now been found, together with ancient gold mine s, and decorations from a high culture prominently display the griffin. The vague myth is seen to be a fact. Mexican Indian legends spoke of a sacred well of sacrifice, into which maidens and jewelry were hurled. Hist orians dismissed this as a mere tale, until the well, at Chichen Itza, was di scovered in the nineteenth century. More than any document, the Bible was assailed as a collection of fanciful myths. Yet, to the embarr assment of the critics, archaeological discoveries proved time and again that the fabled cities, mythical persons and impossible events were true and reliable reporting in every detail. Indeed, the Bible can now be regarded as the most accurate and trustworthy source of history we possess. OUR ANCESTRAL MEMORY OF THE GOLDEN ERA If we are to credit the collective test imony of all ancient races, man’s early history was truly an incredible one . It was a Golden Age of advanced civilization, of original giants who had superior intelligence and technology."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 7 This appears to have been a universal truth, known to everyone in ancient times. Sacred records affirm that at the ve ry beginning (soon after the fall from Paradise) men possessed extraordinary me ntal abilities. Beginning with the raw earth, they mastered a high level of civilization in just the first six generations of their existence. In th at short time they were able to build cities, play complex musical instruments and smelt metals. Indeed, with their scientific complexes, these earliest men, it seems, were no fools. We might well wonder to what de gree they further developed and refined this technology in the final few centuries before the Flood struck. Were the miracles of science as common as they are now? A perfectly valid question, I think. Imagine it, if you can. Paved rainbow cities whose “houses of crystal” reflected every spectral hue; and we’r e talking about air travel, computers and plastics. Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell gave us the telephone, he hinted that it had been done be fore? “The old devices have been reinvented,” he observed. 5 Yes, you read it right. That is exactly what Bell said. In fact the question was pressed furt her by the eminent British scientist Frederick Soddy, winner of a Nobel Prize in physics. He wondered whether the ancients might “not only have attained our present knowledge, but a power hitherto unmastered by us?” 6 PHYSICAL REMAINS ALSO Where did Bell and Soddy get their information? Quite possibly from some musty old records. Nevertheless, our quest is not based on ancient texts and reports, but on accepted scientific discoveries. There are recently discovered artifacts that cannot be dismissed, namely, obj ects of metal sitting in museums, unquestionably made in the ancient world, that would have required very advanced technology to produce. A technology not to be repeated until our day. The weight of evidence grows daily-e vidence that all the major secrets of modern technology were known, and forgotten, long ago. Evidence that early man did create a society that surpassed ours in all aspects of development. The entire world is really a ‘dead man’s tomb’, a treasure hunter’s paradise. As we prize open the coffin, suspense builds. Slowly we’re lifting"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 8 the lid on a lost technology which almost smacks of science fiction. We come face to face with such absurd ities as brain transplants, colonies on Mars and invisible men. And we wonder, What next? Admittedly, such concepts almost strain credibility. We are tempted to ask, Could the ancients have really advanced so far? It may help to consider our own age. As recently as a hundred years ago, we re not most of today’s inventions totally unknown, even unbelievable? Since then the spawning has been sudden-and rapid. What is more, the present age of basic discoveries is hardly at its end. It is forecast th at just fifteen years hence our present accumulated knowledge will have doubled. Do you grasp what that means? How, then, can one possibly conceive of the state of knowledge attained by the antedeluvians before the Deluge struck? THE DELUGE A world war was raging at the time. In the thirty-fourth century B.C., a catastrophe of incredible magnitude intervened, causing the world to wobble and ripping the crust of the earth to shreds. A great Flood swept the whole planet. November 17, 3398 B.C. 7 That day was probably like most others: temperate, balmy. In one longitude, millions were dining...entertaining...relaxing. Precisely at 8 P.M. the earth gave an enormous shudder. Prodded by an outside force, the planet tilted on its axis, and amidst lightning and the worst thunder ever heard by man, the pristine vapour canopy began to disintegrate. A fl oodgate of rain was released upon the earth. There could be no gentle rising of water. Cosmic forces of horrific violence came unleashed. With a dreadful shock, large land masses with their populations slipped into the sea. The surface of the entire gl obe became as a giant maelstrom, in which continents and seas we re churned up together. Attended by a screaming hurricane, tidal waves of 6,000 feet swept toward the poles. A blanket of lava and asphyxiating gases extinguished all life. This cataclysm wiped the Mother Civilization from the face of the earth and consigned its products to a watery grave forever."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 9 Not only were the antedeluvian people buried, but their technological achievements were destroyed, including all form of machinery and construction. It is quite possible that areas which were most densely populated were submerged by the sea or buried under thou sands of feet of debris. It has been scientifically estimated that over 75 percent of the earth’s surface is sedimentary in nature, extending, as in India, to 60,000 feet deep. Indeed, the earth, torn and twisted and shaking, was not to quiet down for centuries. With no less than thre e thousand volcanoes in eruption, a dense cloud of dust enshrouded the earth, blocking out the sun and distorting the climate for hundreds of years. Thus began the Ice Age. 8 Of the human race a mere handful remained; Indeed, their survival was in every sense a miracle. Forewarned, they had salvaged what records they might: a compilation of knowledge which, in due course, woul d be imparted to their descendants. Now for the sake of the reader who is unfamiliar with this event, it should be stressed that the global Flood catastrophe is one of the key facts of all history. Not only is there a mass of geological evidence-it has left an indelible impression on the memory of the entire human race. 9 An analysis of some 600 individual Flood traditions reveals a widespread concurrence on essential points: • the prior corruption of mankind, • a Flood warning unheeded by the masses, • a survival vessel, • the preservation of up to eight people with representative animal life, • the sending forth of a bird to determine the suitability of re- emerging land, • significance in the rainbow, • descent from a mountain, • and the repopulation of the whole earth from a single group of survivors. Especially remarkable is the persistence of that biblical name Noah. And this is particularly so when you consider the ultimate language differences between peoples, and the extreme local distortions which developed in Flood legends. Yet the name survived virtually unchanged in such isolated places as Hawaii (where he was called Nu-u), the Sudan (Nuh), China (Nu-Wah), the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 10 Amazon region (Noa), Phrygia (Noe ) and among the Hottentots (Noh and Hiagnoh). Think about this. Did each of these nations independently concoct the same name for its flood-surviving ancestor? Or did these widely separated peoples refer back to the same family of survivors? The table of nations in Genesis 10 records the gradual dispersion of Noah’s descendants and lists names, thus offering clues to their history and dwelling place. It contends that all na tions of the earth have sprung from the family of Noah. 10 Professor W.F. Albright, internationally recognized archaeological authority, describes this as an ast onishingly accurate document...[which] shows such remarkable ‘modern’ under standing of the ethnic and linguistic situation in the modern world, in spite of all its complexity, that scholars never fail to be impressed with the author’s knowledge of the subject. 11 So, in a nutshell, there is good reason to believe that, after the Deluge, mankind sprang from a single group of people. Chapters 2 to 6 will confirm that these were not idiots, imbeciles or illiterates; they were in a civilized state, with an enormous cultural heritage, before they separated. Chapter 5 traces their ultimate slide into oblivion; while Chapters 7 to 9 raise three challenging questions that need to be answered. Thus prepared, we shall more inte lligently evaluate clues salvaged from the ancient world; an exercise to whic h the major portion of this work is devoted.  "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 11 Chapter 2 SEARCH uick, jump!” shrieked Ed. “Get in, will you!” His jeep door was flung open. I glanced back hurriedly. A fierce-eyed mob was closing the gap. It had happened so fast. Camera strung, I was exploring a fertility temple near Calcutta. To stumble upon a sacrificial blood rite was, to put it mildly, unexpected. Some hawk-eyed watcher raised th e alarm and in seconds, I was the focus of an inflamed pursuit. The foremost devotee was now so close you could hear him panting. A quick sideward glance...the glint of a raised knife...Persuasion enough! I leapt into the moving vehicle; it screeched to top gear and flew. Hours later my heart still pounded ma dly; but now the excitement had shifted. Four bizarre coincidences were startling enough...but a fifth? Was a world-shaking event soon to break, affecting all of us? I had been pondering some old prophecies which declared the end of modern civilization to be already known. The prophecies claimed credibility on the basis of a certain past event. Naturally, before one can begin to consider such prophecies seriously, it must at least be established that the ancient event to which they are linked did in fact occur. I knew Ed Savage to be a bulldog of an archaeologist. Even so, his announcement startled me to no end. That evening I quizzed him over vegetable curry and iced mango juice. “Putting it simply,” he began, “the commonly held view is that we came up from savage, Stone Age beginnings. It was a slow but steady development to civilization.” Q"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 12 He wiped dahl from his fingers. “W ell naturally I expected on-site investigation of the very first cultures to verify this ‘fact.’ But what really emerged was something quite different. The coincidence in each case is simply this: all cultures began sudde nly—and fully developed! A long preliminary period is not supported by archaeology.” “But...” I faltered, groping for words. “Before cities on earth,” he continued, “there was nothing; nothing, I tell you, but a clean slate.” “Are you telling me the evidence points to no transition whatsoever between the ancient civilizations and any primitive forebears?” “Precisely! They did not rise to thei r peak. They were at their peak from the beginning.” “Hogwash!” I snapped. “There has to be trial and error, refinement, evolution.” “SUDDEN” APPEARANCE Edgar went on. “At first I could not believe it either; there was but one pattern—the ‘sudden’ appearance of civilizations worldwide. Five coincidences, or one pattern; call it what you like.” “Meaning?” I looked at him. “Well, there was Egypt. About 3000 B.C., Egypt sprang into existence suddenly, fully developed—that is, wit hout transition from a primitive state, with a fantastic ready-made high society. “Great cities, enormous temples, ” he continued. “Pyramids of overwhelming size. Colossal statues with tremendous expressive power. Luxurious tunnels and tombs. Splendid streets flanked by magnificent sculptures. Perfect drainage systems. A decimal system at the very start. A ready-made writing, already perfected. A well-established naming system (in which each Pharaoh had as many as five names). Society already divided into specialist classes. An army, civil service and hierarchy minutely organized. A court exhibiting all the indications of well-defined precedence and form.” Edgar stirred his dish. “In the remotest period of which there are records, I tell you Egypt shows a level of civilization which is inexplicable. It sounds crazy I know, but it’s a fact!” I emptied my glass without tasting it, and poured another. “What if...” “Go on,” said Edgar. “Oh, forget it. I need a stroll in the night air.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 13 Outside was coal black. An almost eerie stillness. Above, the Milky Way floatcd brilliantly close. A gentle , warm breeze brushed my face. My mind wafted back...back...back. Inexplicable, he said. Inexplicable unless...Suddenly it flashed. ‘That’s it!” I heard myself shouting, glad that nobody could hear me. “Yes, it is inexplicable, unless Egypt received he r heritage basically from somewhere else.” Egypt came from a clearly established civilization. Triumphantly I strode back inside. Ed politely heard me out. “So she got it from someone else, eh?” The archaeologist ran a finger under his collar and swallowed. “Just, uh...” He cleared his throat and tried again. “...just who was Egypt’s invisible mother?” I have to admit, it stopped me for a moment. “It wasn’t only Egypt,” he went on. “Take a look at Sumeria. The appearance around 3000 B.C. of Sumerian civilization was likewise sudden, unexpected and out of nowhere. “H. Frankfort (Tell Uqair) called it ‘astonishing.’ Pierre Amiet (Elam) termed it ‘extraordinary.’ A. Parrot (Sumer) described it as ‘a flame which blazed up so suddenly.’ Leo Oppenheim (Ancient Mesopotamia) stressed ‘the astonishingly short perio the civilization had arisen. Joseph Campbell (The Masks of God) summed it up this way: ‘With stunning abruptness...there appears in this l ittle Sumerian mud garden...the whole cultural syndrome that has since constitu ted the germinal unit of all the high civilizations of the world.” ‘d’ within which 12 Ed crumpled the napkin on his plate. “There’s your second coincidence. “But I’ve also been examin ing the evidence unearthed in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro,” Ed stated. “They were the key centers of the Indus Valley civilization. These also appear to have suddenly sprung up with no clear- cut traces of having evolved from primitive beginnings. Your third coincidence.” The archaeologist opened his mouth and closed it again. “Perhaps I’ve got an overwrought imagination,” he said carefully, “but there’s one possibility I must explore. Do you think some explosive, unknown event might lie behind all this? “You see, the Maya of Central America are in it, too. The Mayan calendar goes back to approximately th e same time (c. 3000 B.C.). And sure enough, at the outset of Mayan culture, their script was already perfect.” Another bombshell. I arose and leaned against the plaster wall, studying the evidence, sighing. “Four very od d coincidences. You said there were five.” “Indeed there are.

Just wish I had an answer. The very next day Edgar was Nepal-bound; one thing seemed sure, our next meeting would be memorable. That night I couldn’t sleep. My head was throbbing, the mystery deepening. How was all this possible? So many in stant civilizations. I took a map, encircled these suddenly appearing, ready-made cultures and stared at them. A COMMON ORIGIN? Was there any connection between them? I began to sift every available isolated piece of information. Over the next few months the search would lead through scores of countries. Meanwhile, back of my mind the thought kept surfacing: what of the prophecies? Something told me there was a conn ection, though I knew not where. As for a possible link between the “instant” civilizations, eight clues emerged. 1. Symbols and hieroglyphics, identical worldwide, bore the marks of a common heritage. Everywhere the swastika, snake and sun combinations, as well as numerous specialized and intricate glyphs were repeated with no chance of coincidence. 14 2. Likewise, similar systems of writing were in use—again all over the globe, even on isolated islands. This was striking. 3. And languages had similarities. The older these were, the more they resembled each other. Practica lly all languages have connections through both vocabulary and construction. In almost every language are many words containing similar root words or combinations beyond what mere chance would allow. (Take, for instance, the names of the constellations. I found these were s ubstantially the same whether in Mexico, Africa or Polynesia.) 4. The calendars of Egypt and faraway Peru both had eighteen months of twenty days, with a five-day holiday at year’s end. 5. I also took into account the great similarities in buildings, not only in construction but in astronomical alignment. Sphinxes in Egypt and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 15 Yucatan; pyramids on every continent and on remote islands; monoliths and stone circles also worldwide and often quarried elsewhere in the world. I was struck by similarity even as to original purpose. The Tower of Babel was built (according to Josephus, first-century Jewish historian) to provide shelter should another Deluge destroy the earth. And regarding the Toltec pyramids, the Mexican chronicler, Ixtlilxochitl, states: “After men had multiplied, they erected a very high ‘zacuali,’ which is today a tower of gr eat height, in order to take refuge in it should the second world be destroyed.” Now I ask you, without a common source, why should the purpose be identical in Babylon and Mexico? 15 6. Customs again were similar, as in burial, mummification, circumcision, or in binding babies’ heads to produce an elongated skull. (The Maya, Incas, Celts, Egyptians and Basques did this.) 7. Forms of religious observance bore more striking similarities. 8. Finally I added to the list worldwide traditions of early history. Traditions of a Garden of Delight, a Golden Age, a global Flood, one original language, a tower where s udden language confusion resulted in a dispersal—clearly these bore the marks of a common source. Of one thing I was certain. The origins of cultures that were so different and so widely dispersed could not wh olly be explained by borrowing and imitation. The Russian poet Valeri Brussov seemed to express it well: “At the bases of the oldest cultures of mankind we must look for a single influence...We must look back beyond antiquity for an X, for a still unknown cultural world that set the engine we know in motion. “The Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Greeks and Romans were all our teachers, but who were our teachers’ teachers?” 16 My attention was riveted. Here we re several fully developed cultures, apparently related, suddenly appearing out of nowhere. Well, how does one deal with such a discovery? I must confess, my curiosity was exploding. One more search was imperative. This time I had to track down the common source of any footprints leading to these cultures."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 16 Fig. 2—1. Comparison by Larry E.

The evidence fairly tumbled out. Language was the first clue. It was soon apparent that root words in almost every language had their origins in the Middle East. Written signs added to the evidence. A single system of signs used over an extensive area of the earth by the St one-writers originated likewise in the Middle East. Anthropology provided another helpful clue. I discovered that the best reconstructions by anthropologists located man’s point of origin close to the center of the Europe-Asia-Africa land mass. Archaeological finds clinched it. Agriculture had spread all over the world from, where else, but the Middle East highlands. In every instance plants, shrubs and fruit-bearing trees basic to survival and advancement came out of the Middle East first. Botanical genetic studies “confirm the archaeological finds and leave no doubt.” 17 There it was. Our beginnings were in the Middle East highlands. I suggested this to Ed Savage when next we met. The first thing he did was throw at me a tricky question: “So tell me, then, why did agriculture begin in the difficult arc of mountains and highlands? Doesn’t it make you wonder? Why was it not begun on the fertile, easily cultivated plains and valleys?” It was a natural enough question. During my search I had found other scholars expressing surprise at this most odd discovery. “Have you considered a worldwide Deluge?” he suggested. “You don’t mean Noah’s Flood?” I snorted. “Just that,” clipped Ed. “It does shed some light on things.” “Jon, don’t you see? Survivors of such a Deluge (an event most scholars have overlooked) would still be in the mountains. The lowlands were not yet dry enough following the global Flood.” “And did you know, biblical sources not only point to Ararat (Armenia) as the landing place of the Flood survivors, but state that they landed ‘in the mountains.’” 18 Ed unfolded a world map; I elbowed over it on the table. He pointed out the pertinent areas. “Artifacts uncovered suggest that settled communities extended from the Americas in the west to Thailand in the east by 3000 B.C. And overlaying that is a proven pattern of high cultures from Spain to Pakistan.”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 18 I stared, somewhat intrigued, at the map. Armenia, the dispersion point, lay almost precisely in the middle. (I would later discover that other researchers had reached a similar conclusion. As says Howells: “If we look, first of all, for that part of the world which was the hothouse of the races, we can make only one choice. All the visible footsteps lead away from Asia. “) 19 “Ed,” I asked, “could this perhaps be the key to your five coincidences?” “Oh, I hardly think so. How?” I recited to Edgar the succession of discoveries made since our last meeting. 1. Each of the first civilizations appeared suddenly, already fully developed. (Ed’s find.) 2. A connection existed between them. 3. Their footprints led back to the Middle East mountains. The archaeologist thought a minute, eyes narrowed, working through all the angles. Gradually a smile formed on those weathered lips. “By gum, man, you’ve hit it! Only one thing could explain their high level of civilization. Those nations got their heritage basically from the world that was wiped out in the Deluge. They continued where the generation of the biblical Noah left off!” “Those Flood survivors must have carried sufficient knowledge of the antedeluvian era to give a rapid start to the new cultures that sprang up ‘out of nowhere’ soon after.” He clicked hi s fingers. “And the timing. Four hundred years—all it needed. The oldest civilizations appear just long enough after the Deluge for a populatio n density to support a culture.” Of course we could hardly claim to be first. Sir Leonard Woolley notched up a similar observation years before: “It was confidently expected that the widely held view of a gradua l development would be proved, but the whole evidence has been to the cont rary; indeed, it has grown to such proportions where we contact the most ancient civilizations that we find the peak was reached soon after the flood.” 20 The sudden appearance of civilization is itself a memorial to history’s one great catastrophe. More importantly, the Flood is a historical event of tremendous testimonial impor tance to modern man. As in the days of Noah, the world has reached an unprecedented stage of material and technical progress. Then, as now, skepticism, corruption and violence abound."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 19 Ancient prophecies treat Noah and the Flood as a prototype of the coming sudden and fearful end of the present world."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 20 Fig. 2— 2.

Other prophecies project that as the firs t world perished by water, so the present world shall be destroyed by fire (2 Pet. 3:3-7). And as this second world emerged from the Deluge stripped of its original glory, so shall emerge from the final fire, a new world cleansed of evil, misery and death, and restored to a perfection which sha ll transcend even its original glory. WORLD ORDER FROM THE RUINS It goes without saying that the small group of bewildered survivors from the Deluge could hardly reproduce all of the aspects of the pre-Flood technology. Nevertheless they woul d have bequeathed to their migrating descendants the information of which they had personal or recorded knowledge. We know that the very earliest grains show genetic evidence of sophisticated manipulation; that is, they were already uniform and highly specialized immediately after the Flood. In an attempt to reconstruct the an tedeluvian technology, the semblance of an integrated global civilization emerged in various parts of the world. Its achievements were astonishing; in so me spheres, penetrating knowledge which our science has scarcely begun to nudge.

The explorer Humboldt is paddling down the wild waters of the upper Orinoco. Fo rmidable cliffs press upon him from both sides. Suddenly he glimpses, etched in the rock high above, an array of strange messages. Humboldt asks the natives what it means. Their reply is so startling, he almost tips out of his canoe. Exactly 130 years later, Halil Edhem, Director of the National Museums of Turkey, is cleaning out debris in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. He comes upon the dusty fragments of an ol d map. Examination shows that it was compiled by an Admiral Piri Reis in 1513, from portions of much older maps. Not until 1956, however, is the map subj ected to a serious analysis. The Hydrographic Office of the U.S. Navy i ssues a statement. What it reveals is almost unbelievable. Just twelve years later, Richard Nixon arrives in China. A cultural exchange is initiated with America. Interest is awaken ed in an ancient Chinese document, the Shan Hai King . Something which this old manuscript reveals is enough to rock you off your seat. All these seemingly unrelated events would come together with compelling force on October 17, 1984. On that day, I strolled into the foyer of a I Hong Kong hotel for a rendezvous with the Jigsaw Team. Five men and one woman were converging with resu lts of separate investigations into some very strange recent discoveries. T"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 24 Phillip Corderoy was a cartographer; Denise Tagg a linguist of no mean accomplishment; Paul Heron a mathematician; Jacob Wajsmann a keen student of prehistory; and Charlie Pe rch a Scotland Yard-trained detective who had turned to genealogy more from passion than from pecuniary ambitions. His innate skepticism woul d render Perch all the more valuable for critical analysis. As it turned out, we would spend four days in a tight little suite, advancing the pieces each of us held of the jigsaw puzzle, then slowly keying them together until a clear picture developed—a picture which would prove more startling than any of us ever expected. ...Corderoy snapped open his briefcase, withdrew a sheaf of papers and squinted at us over his spectacles. “I want you each to take a gander at these maps. There are fourteen of them, all from the Medieval and Renaissance period.” Corderoy laid them on the table. “This one is the Zeno map, drawn in 1380. See how accurately it outlines the coasts of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Scotland, as well as the exact latitude and longitude of a certain number of islands.” “Just a minute, Phil,” Heron cut in. “The chronometer, necessary to determine longitude, was not invented until 1765.” “He’s right,” said Perch. “That is why the readings of Columbus were all inaccurate.” 1 “Nevertheless, the Zeno map is mo st accurate,” insisted Corderoy. “And notice, the topography of Greenland is shown free of glaciers as it was prior to the Ice Age. Unknown rivers and mountains shown on this Zeno map have since been located in probes of the French Polar Expedition of 1947-1949. What do you think of that?” Silence. “See this photograph? It shows a Chinese map on stone from 1137, formed on a spherical grid. “And this is the Camerio map of 1502, which uses the same spherical grid.” Miss Tagg looked agitated. “Listen, Phil, in the Middle Ages they thought the earth was flat. Are you certain these are not modern fakes?” “No chance of a mistake, I assure yo u. But just wait till you see this.” Corderoy passed around another sheet. “Now, here’s the Zauche map of 1737. It shows Antarctica free of—” Wajsmann interjected. “Impossible, Phil. Antarctica’s existence was not verified until 1819!”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 25 Corderoy grinned. “I expected that. Nevertheless, this map does show that continent—and completely free of ice to boot. Surprisingly, it is shown not as one continent but two islands separated by a strait from the Ross to the Weddell Seas (a fact which was not established until the Geophysical Year, 1968). Also shown are islands of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, now known to lie on the bottom of the ocean. “Now here’s a map drawn in 1531 by Orontius Fineus, in which the dimensions of the Antarctic land mass correspond very closely to those on the best modern maps. The map indicates that the center of Antarctica was beginning to fill with ice when its sour ce maps were drawn. It shows rivers and fjords in Antarctica where today mile-thick glaciers flow. “Next, notice this Mercator chart of 1569; it depicts only the Antarctic coast left uncovered by glaciers. “I really don’t follow you,” said Heron. ‘The events you’re describing are Ice Age, cave man era and all that. Yet you admitted these are Renaissance maps.” Corderoy burst into laughter. “That’s right. But I think you’ll agree these particular maps are infinitely superior to the regular maps made at that time. Now I’ll share a secret. You see, my friends, many of the Medieval and Renaissance mapmakers admitted they were copying from sources whose origins were unknown. “These maps are a scientific achieve ment far surpassing the abilities of the navigators and mapmakers of the Renaissance, Middle Ages, the Arab world, or any ancient geographers. They are the product of an unknown people antedating recognized history. “Now, here’s a very exciting map, copied in 1559. The Hadji Ahmed map shows Antarctica and the Pacific coast of the United States of America with extreme accuracy. It also depicts the land bridge that once existed between Siberia and Alaska. “This Andrea Benincasa map (1508) indicates that Northern Europe was being covered by the Ice Age glaciation’s furthest advance. “Here is the Iehudi Ibn ben Zara map of 1487. Notice these remnants of glaciers in Britain? And the detailed pr ofiles of islands in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas? Those islands are still there—but now under water. “The Hamy King chart (1502) indicates northern Siberian rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean (but which are now all under ice). It also shows glacial actions in the Baltic count ries. What are today huge islands in Southeast Asia are shown on this ma p joined to land (which they once were). And you know what?

Its a beauty.” With a teasing twinkle, Corderoy ey ed us each in turn, arose from his chair and ambled over to the window. He stood there gazing over the harbor toward Victoria Peak with its skirt of skyscrapers. He just stood there and said nothing. It was as though we were no longer with him. “Come on, Phil. We’re waiting. What’s this trump of yours?” Corderoy turned, still smirking, and rejoined us. He felt for something in his briefcase and plopped it on the table. “This is the Piri Reis chart of 1513,” he began. “After its discovery, Captain Arlington H. Mallery, an Amer ican authority on cartography, asked the U.S. Hydrographic Office to examine it. The U.S. Navy, through Commander Larsen, subsequently issued this statement.” Corderoy took his notes and read to us. “‘The Hydrographic Office of the Na vy has verified an ancient chart— it’s called the Piri Reis map, that goes back more than 5,000 years. It’s so accurate, only one thing could explain it—a worldwide survey. The Hydrographic Office couldn’t believe it, either, at first. But they not only proved the map genuine, it’s been used to correct errors in some present-day maps.’” Corderoy grew excited. “I say if ev er there were a treasure map, this is it. Just crammed with priceless gems. It tells the story of ancient coastlines, as well as the surprising exploits of our ancestors five thousand years ago. “Piri Reis stated that his copy was a composite from twenty ancient maps. So let’s explore it.” I took a pad and noted the following features: 1. South America and Africa in correct relative longitude and latitude. Not only were the Caribbean, Spanis h, African and South American"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 28 coasts in correct positions relative to each other, but even isolated land areas, like Cape Verde Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, as well as topographies of the interiors—mountain ranges, peaks, rivers, plateaus. All were accura tely positioned by longitude and latitude. 2. The coastline of Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. The islands and bays of the depicted coastline are the same as they appear below the Antarctic ice sheet (as recently revealed by seismic echo soundings). Pictured in great detail are regions scarcely explored today, including a mountain range that remained undiscovered until 1952. Interestingly, the map shows two bays where the modern seismic map showed lands. However, when the experts were asked to check their measurements, they found that the ancient map was correct, after all. One thing was crystal clear. Either somebody had mapped Antarctica before the ice cap covere d the continent, or else the ice- covered continent was mapped with ve ry sophisticated instruments. 2 3. The Isle of Pines, Andros Island, San Salvador, Jamaica, the mouth of the Amazon and the island of Morajo are all correctly shaped and perfectly located in latitude and longitude. 4. A major error appeared to be Greenland, shown as three islands. But during the International Geophysical Year it was proved that this correctly represented the state of affairs about 3000 B.C. 5. Every mountain range in northern Canada and Alaska was recorded on this ancient map—including some ranges which the U.S. Army Map Services did not have on their maps. But the U.S. Army has since found them! 6. The ancient source-maps were drawn using a circular grid based on spherical trigonometry, with the focal point situated in Egypt. The copiest Piri Reis (unfamiliar with circular projection) shifted and spliced the original grid to co mpensate for the curvature. Any modern spheroid projection on a flat surface would cause the same distortion. (Notice this in the accompanying comparison between Piri Reis and a modern map.) Corderoy pressed the point. Was this not compelling proof of the map’s validity? Clearly it came from an advanced ancient technology and its grid system is similar to air navigation maps. Even so, we cannot know how many times it was imperfectly copied. “Now listen to this,” said Corderoy. “The Piri Reis map projection was based on an overestimate of 4 1/2 degrees in the circumference of the earth."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 29 Only one geographer in the ancient worl d had made that overestimation: the Greek Eratosthenes. “When the Piri Reis map is redrawn to correct the Eratosthenes error, all existing longitude errors on the map are thereby reduced to almost zero. “This can mean only one thing. Do you see? The Greeks who mapped according to Eratosthenes’ circumference had before them source maps which had been drawn without that error. Thus, the geographical knowledge on which the Piri Reis map is based ultimately originated not with the Greeks but with an earlier people who possessed a more advanced science of mapmaking than even the Greeks!” “That’s brilliant!” exclaimed Perch. “Couldn’t do better myself. What you’re saying is that while Greece and Rome were developing new civilizations, the vestiges of an olde r one, seemingly worldwide in scope, was vanishing. It left these maps, which were partly incomprehensible. So later cartographers altered them. Yes, I can see that.” “There’s just one more thing,” said Corderoy. “The evidence indicates that what we have here is only part of an original world map.” He paused. “Whew!” whistled Wajsmann. So here it was—evidence of science in an early epoch, which is considered to have had none. Here we re physical fragments of the amazing knowledge of a super culture long vanished. We spread out six pieces of the jigsaw—facts which were now apparent concerning those early explorers: 1. They possessed a knowledge of cartogr aphy comparable to our own. 2. They knew the correct shape and size of the earth. 3. They possessed a knowledge of cartogr aphy comparable to our own. 4. They knew the correct shape and size of the earth. 5. They used spherical trigonomet ry in their mathematical measurements. 6. They utilized ultramodern methods of projection (exact coordinates). 7.

Almost 5,000 years ago somebody undertook a survey of the whole planet. The technology at their disposal was very sophisticated. Breakfast next morning was in a sma ll restaurant off Nathan Road. Rice congee and fried pastries. Different! Wajsmann had uncovered some little-know n data which quite rocked us. Back in our room, he elaborated. “Did you know that thousands of years ago people in India knew faraway England as ‘the Island of the White Cliffs’? Their Vishnu Purana reveals a close acquaintance with Europe . The geographical contours of the Americas and the North Polar zone are also described in detail.” “That interests me, Jacob.” All eyes turned to Denise Tagg. “My family was Irish, so I’ve had a penchant for the most ancient Irish legends. And you know what? They agree. They say that Ireland was visited by men from India—the Dravidians—who came not as invaders but as surveyors. Wajsmann nodded. “The Maya of Gu atemala divided a spherical earth into five major continents: Africa, Europe-Asia, North and South America and Australia. “And in second-century Greece, Flaviu s Philostratus wrote, ‘If the land be considered in relation to the entire mass of water, we can show that the earth is the lesser of the two.’ Now, I ask you, how could the ancients have known this if they had not traversed and measured the earth’s surface?” “Admittedly, you have a point there,” observed Heron. “Of course, the earliest Egyptians were knowledgeable about land measurements, too; and they practiced sophisticated surveying techniques. In fact, they understood enough to infl uence many other nations, in locating important cities and temples on meridian s, all based on simple fractions of the earth’s dimensions. “It seems to me that this independe nt testimony from different races does back up Phil’s evidence from the maps.” Perch smoothed his moustache. “Over breakfast, Jacob, you spoke of an ancient Chinese book.” “That I did, Charlie. I find it quite an astonishing document. I’m referring to the Fourth Book of Shan Hai King entitled ‘The Classic of Eastern Mountains,’ from 2250 BC. In it there are four sections describing mountains located ‘beyond the Eastern Sea’—on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Each section begins by describing the geographical features"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 32 of a particular mountain: its height , shape, mineral deposits, surrounding rivers and types of flora. Then it points the direction and distance to the next mountain, and so on. 4 “It’s like a road map. By followi ng the clues, we’ve found that these sections describe in detail the topography of western and central North America. ‘Each mountain can be identified—and each river. “I tell you, this document is a geographi cal survey. But that’s not all. It even gives the experiences of the surveyors—from picking up black opals and gold nuggets in Nevada, to watc hing seals frolic on the rocks in San Francisco Bay. They recorded their fascination at a strange animal that avoided danger by pretending to be dead (obviously the native opossum). You can read about their wonder at th e Grand Canyon, ‘a stream flowing in a bottomless ravine,’ and a sunrise there. (That’s in the Ninth and Fourteenth Books.) ‘By the third century B.C., wh en many Chinese records were reevaluated and condensed, it was found that the geographical learning it contained did not correspond to any lands known at that time. So it was reclassified as a myth. Now we know better.” “Well, what do you know!” exclaime d Perch. “A detailed Chinese survey of North America 4,500 years ago!” “Precisely. Part of the global survey, I dare say.” Denise Tagg sprang into action. “This is where my piece of the jigsaw comes in. I’ve done some detective work along many of the routes which those surveyors of North America took. Would you believe, some rock drawings still survive? Among these pictures on stone you can recognize carvings of the Chinese dragon. “Stone-writers left their traces on every continent. A single system of signs was used. 5 They used 241 special sequences of particular geometric signs and symbols. The stone-writers were not barbaric hunters or nomads. They were intelligent people who were systemat ic in what they did. In their repetition and locations, the symbols had meaning and purpose. 6 I am certain the stone-writers left these guide signs to mark the way for others who would follow them. These surveyor s left their traces in the form of maps, symbols and place names.” (Of course, symbols left on rocks and tablets presuppose communication by language. I recalled the biblical assertion that “the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.” 7 The evidence seemed now to support it.) It was my turn to submit a piece of the jigsaw; I passed around copies."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 33 “This is a report by the explorer Humboldt. In 1799, while wandering in Guiana and the upper Orinoco, Humboldt came across rock pictures and hieroglyphic signs high up on the mountains. “The natives told him that their ancestors, in the time of the great waters, came to the tops of these mounta ins in canoes, and that the rocks were still so soft that a man could trace marks on them with his bare fingers.” 8 I paused to let this sink in. “Go on,” urged Heron. “Can you see the significance?” I asked. “It tallies precisely with conditions that prevailed after th e global Deluge. Great inland seas remained on all continents, often trap ped at high levels, and not draining back into the o cean for centuries. “The Deluge, as it reshaped contin ents, thrust sedimentary rubble mountain-high. This would have remained soft and impressionable for a considerable time.” Miss Tagg cut in. “That reminds me of picture writings elsewhere. From the highlands of Colombia to the gorge of the Xingu, on the eastern side of Brazil’s Matto Grosso, they all have one feature in common: they are carved on high rocks, in gloomy canyons, impossible to climb. You know, some are up to seventy feet tall. It’s the same in the Mexican mountain ranges; in Siberia too. The signs are found on impossible cliffs.” Perch cleared his throat. “So with in centuries of the Flood, the new population undertook a resources survey of the whole earth. And they mapped every continent. Yeah, I see that. “Now I think we can identify some of the men involved in this. Biblical chronology throws some light on it.” That was one out of the blue! Actual names? “Yes, three, in fact. During the period 2800 to 2500 B.C. “First there was a guy called Peleg. The Book of Genesis ( 10:25 ) states that ‘in his day was the earth divided’ (as in ‘allotment,’ ‘marking off an area’). I’ve looked into this. A more accurate translation would be: ‘In his day was the earth measured’ (or ‘surveyed’).” I noticed a murmur of surprise. “Then there was Mizraim, according to the chronology a grandson of Noah, who is credited with founding Egypt. His name means ‘to delineate,’ ‘to draw up a plan,’ ‘to make a representation’ (especially in association with measuring distances). And sure enough, at least two old maps linked with the ancient past (the Piri Reis and Reinal) were based on a circular projection with the focal point in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 34 “Perhaps it is no accident that the Great Pyramid records in its dimensions the measurement of the earth on the scale of 1:43,200.

Many of these maps we’ve been studying reveal peculiarities of geograp hy that were first noticed by the Arabs.” Wajsmann spoke now. “That’s really something, Charlie. When did Almodad die?” “About 2350 B.C. give or take a few.” “What a clincher! That Chinese Shan Hai King book was written only a century later!” That evening the Jigsaw Team celeb rated.

All the familiar landmarks had been swept away. Instead, barren wastes, bleak and ster ile hills and unbearable extremes of cold and heat confronted them. Great mountain ranges—high, forbidding, rocky walls—had been thrust up, destined to isolate areas into harsh climatic pockets. The first generations were born and gr ew up in the foothills of Ararat. But in time their curiosity was to draw them out to stake new territories and to search for valuable resources. They soon found a world reduced c onsiderably in land area. The fertility of the soil and the natural resources necessary to human progress were now unequally distributed. A"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 36 One resource was of particular concern. Antedeluvian scientists had unlocked a secret. They had discovered our spinning planet to be a giant generator, its land masses crisscrossed with energy lines. These magnetic currents they had harnessed. But now all trace of the power network was gone. OBJECT OF THE GLOBAL SURVEY Within centuries the rapidly increasing population sent out exploratory expeditions. Soon almost every corner of the world was visited by a group of men who came with a particular task to accomplish. 1 They were charged with relocating those energy springs and constructing a grid pattern to harness them. Today we might have called it—one imagines—Operation Spider Web, or some such thing. To facilitate this, they employed un its of measurement based on simple fractions of the earth’s dimensions. They measured distances, as we have noticed, in degrees, minutes and seconds of latitude and longitude, just as we do today. 2 Soon a “prehistoric” network of dead-s traight alignments appeared. It seems to have sprung up everywhere at once. Planning took place on an almost unimaginably large scale. Along these lines, (situated at terrestrial power points) arose temples, pillars, rocking stones, circles, crosses, mounds, pyramids, tunnels and platforms. Traces of these are dotted still throughout the world. You see them on every continent and even on remote islands. 3 Sites had an exact geometric relationship to each other within a master worldwide pattern. For example, all ancient temples in Greece arose in relation to each other. Those in Greece were geometrically interlocked with those in Egypt. Planetwide, the system constituted ONE GIANT SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT. Today we all live within the ruins of this single vast ancient structure, whose sheer size has so far rendered it invisible. In the words of John Michell, “a great scientific instrument lies sprawled over the entire surface of the globe.” 4 It is marked by these megaliths of all types, all aligned in a single geometric pattern— the remains of an ancient power network."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 37 "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 38 "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 39 In order for it to operate, many s ites were aligned to favor certain astronomical phenomena. The pla nners were conversant with the introduction of solar or atmospheric energy into the terrestrial energy streams. They developed a technology to detect earth currents, and then to manipulate them to a predictable result. Thus, all over the world, thousands upon thousands of pillars (called “menhirs”) arose in symmetrical formation, their purpose to realign earth magnetism from its natura l meandering paths to straight artificial lines. At each pillar, the electric current of the atmosphere was attracted to combine with the terrestrial current to produce a fusion of power. (A secret we have not yet utilized.) Interestingly, the standing stones were all rich in quartz, a crystal similar to that used with the cat’s whiskers in early radio receivers. It has been suggested that megalith s were connected below ground by metal strips, although there is no conclusi ve proof for this position. Because the standing stones worked as cathod es, the corrosive current over the millennia would have most certainly dissolved the metal, leaving the grooves into which they were set. Such grooves are found below ground level in, for example, the Breton menhirs of France. That these grooves had some such functional purpose is a distinct possibility. And something else. Researchers have detected an energy rising in spiral form from standing stones, gath ering magnetic strength toward the top of the stone. Interestingly, photographs of the stones are sometimes marred by a mist of light surrounding their lower extremities. The crucial factor was that from natu ral energy springs in the earth, the currents were ultimately directed to mounds—which focalized the energy fields. There is overwhelming evidence for the reality of these forces, only rediscovered in modern times by Wilhel m Reich. He described how this energy could be trapped or accumulate d by constructing a chamber lined with inorganic material and covered on the outside with alternate layers of organic and inorganic matter. Is it not startling, then, to find that almost every ancient site has at least one such buried chamber—purposely lined with the same alternating layers! Often foreign stones and clay were used, selected for various magnetic properties. These submerged chambers were energy accumulators. Finally, from these mounds, the currents were dissipated to the surrounding countryside. Not only did standing stones, mounds and pyramids focus energy fields. Across the whole world, the structures formed a gigantic power network."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 40 This provided the population with a source of energy and inspiration to which their whole civilization was tuned. EARLY USES OF THE POWER NETWORK It appears that a major effect of the energy lines was to increase soil fertility and plant growth."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 41 Fig. 4-2. A spiral force has been sensed ar ound ancient standing stones; this is derived from their positions above the crossing of earth’s ma gnetic currents immediately underneath. (Francis Hitching.)"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 42 Fertility stones are no myth. (The phallic symbolism which later developed was a degenera tive response to an earlier scientific truth.) Modern experiments have shown that cosmic influences do affect magnetic currents at the earth’s surf ace and that at certain seasons rocks become charged with energy which th ey release into the soil, stimulating seed germination and vegetable growth. Lightning flashes also are known to affect the nitrates of the earth, ensuring fertility. Green tomatoes placed within a magnetic field have been shown to ripen four to six times faster; seeds placed in a current grew many times faster. Something new here? The energy lines were also harnessed for propulsion and transport, if we are to believe Druid reports. When a line became animated by a sunrise directly down a path, the currents were purposely directed so as to charge an object to such a degree that it could be levitated and made to travel. British flying vehicles so energized arc said to have flown to Greece. Of course, an eclipse intervening co uld lead to disaster, by causing a sudden drop in the power of magnetic activ ity. This would shut down all of the society’s machinery, an event co mparable to modern-day electrical blackouts. Thus, only by a constant computation of solar, lunar and planetary movements could the waxing and waning of the currents be measured and anticipated. Here lies the answer to a riddle. We’ve long wondered why ancient astronomers seemed so obsessed—almos t insanely so—by the need to predict eclipses with absolute certainty. Now you know. Another use of the network was power production and communication. A word here on pyramids. The pyramid shape is known to accumulate and may even generate energy—provided that specific proportions and exact alignments are followed. So somebody’s told you that pyramids were tombs! In general, pyramids were not built as tombs (more on that later). Significantly, they were part of the worldwide network. For starters, eighty-five survive in Egypt; at least four in France (one radioactive); hundreds along coastal Peru; thousands in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras; while still more survive in China, Tibet, Southern Russia, the Sudan, Brazil, Hawaii, Tahiti, the Marianas, Caroline Islands, Marquesas islands and Bermuda (submerged); as well as stone step-pyramids in Florida and pyramid-like temples in Southern India. Now, that’s some list. And there is evidence, quite consid erable evidence, that the pyramids focused energy fields; that is, they produced power."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 43 Additionally, healing probably resulted from this energy system. It has been observed that animals born over “springs” of favorable energy are always healthier than those born elsewhere. A connection has been noticed between the incidence of ailments such as cancer and the location of dwellings over lines of earth current that have become sour. Such “black streams” have been pur ified successfully by driving metal stakes into the earth above the cause. The effect , it seems, is to allow atmospheric forces to enter the flow of the earth current. LATER USES We know that the Chinese sited every building, stone, and planted tree to conform to the “dragon current s” that flowed along the lines. The Incas utilized similar spirit lines w ith the Sun Temple at Cuzco as their hub. The Romans built their famous straight roads along these already existing lines. North African Bedouins use the line system marked out by standing stones and cairns to aid their crossing of today’s desert wastes. The Australian aborigines still use the “prehistoric” line system. At certain times of the year these “turi ngas” (lines) become revitalized, they say, by energies flowing through th em, giving new life to the adjacent countryside. The natives paint the stor y on rocks, but claim it is not the pictures but the rocks themselves that release energy to fertilize plants and animals. The aborigines actually r eceive messages over vast distances and are forewarned of the approach of strangers—all through their system of magic lines. It’s a residual legacy, you see, from a former global science. THE BABEL CONNECTION By its very nature, this network required that all terrestrial surface currents be accounted for, if it were to operate to its full potential. Thus the stone monuments were strewn across the world, located on the crossings of the “ley lines.” This implies that a single authority was directing a united world effort. Perhaps the biblical Tower of Babel was the receiving station for earth’s ley line currents. At any rate, it was constructed as the result of a concerted effort on the part of the outspreading nations to remain together “lest we be"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 44 scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” 5 The tower was a center of world communications, as well as of energy accumulation. The city of Babel (later to become Babylon) was a political center for world government. By possessing such a global energy center, Babel effectively controlled the world. Old chronicles record th at Nimrod, the egotistic founder of Babylon, “grew more and more wicked and mad until he thought in his heart that he was himself God.” The arrogance of Babel became a scandal. Then something happened—something significant enough to mark a break in world conditions and to bring the line system to an end. Today we are left with but shadows and remnants of the former universal system. Thanks to archaeological discoveries, much of what was classed as myth in the biblical account of the rise of na tions is now being found true. It is becoming increasingly tenable to regard its “stories” as not religious fantasy but rather apt reporting of phenomena that actually occurred. The story of a former global unity which was broken into factions is now seen as real. It might be said that the sudden breakup of the totalitarian world government was the catalyst. In the ev ents which followed, most continents and island groups were to become so isolated, they would all but forget each other’s existence. Thus began the next stage of man’s decline."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 45 Chapter 5 SUDDEN FURY he event was devastating. Shock wa ves from it are still being felt today. Until that moment, the plan to contain the fast-growing population under one central world authority, based at Babel, appeared to be working. Then in one violent stroke, communications were destroyed. In the resultant chaos, th e world alliance collapsed. A confused secondary migration bega n and many peoples lost contact (see map of prehistoric era in Chapter 4). So now the world order was gone , but one thing lingered on—the memory of the technology they had once enjoyed. SECONDARY CIVILIZATIONS ARISE Traditions and biblical writings speak of a mass dispersion of peoples from the early Babel civilization about a thousand years after the Deluge. It is significant that a number of archaeologists take the Tower of Babel record seriously and conjecture it to be in the period somewhat before 2000 B.C. And sure enough, a surprising number of “new” civilizations that suddenly appear are dated to approximately 2000 B.C. I’m wondering, could this be more than coincidence? T"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 46 PROGRESSIVE DECLINE Soon communications were reestab lished among the now separate nations. But all was not well. Some of those who still retained the awesome knowledge, ultimately used it in a highly destructive war. In a succession of nuclear—yes, nuclear—holocausts, several advanced na tions on three continents vanished. (The chilling story awaits us in Chapter 29.) From their wreckage, “primitive” a nd agricultural economies emerged. Salvaging little but essentials, the survivors had to concentrate on bare survival. Without technological facilities to repair what remained of the equipment and machinery, they soon fell into disuse. Only the vivid memory survived. Of course there were civilization centers untouched by these disasters. These entered a period of decline. Existing knowledge was fused with the cultures of later societies. But these civilizations lasted not many centuries past 2000 B.C. There is some evidence that a brief period of revival was, over the centuries, experienced in each of the Middle Eastern countries, as remnants of earlier advanced technology resurfaced, although on a greatly diminished scale. Sophisticated artifacts and records from their earlier past appear to have enriched both Babylonia and Egypt in later times. Indeed, isolated elements of the old technology continued to resurface from time to time. From about 250 B.C. to the time of Christ, there was a fragmentary technological rekindling among Mediterranean peoples. This, I might add, was brutally extinguished by the Roman invasion of the area. Already for some time a privileged fe w had been the sole custodians of what knowledge remained. They had kept the secrets “safe” from abuse by the “unqualified.” Now, as the world began to slip into the Dark Ages, the few records that survived were jealously guarded by secret societies. Gradually these too passed into oblivion. And the world forgot its past. Only in the last 300 years have we witnessed a cultural revival. And only now are we rediscovering that which used to be. Doesn’t it shake you up just a little to realize that basically the way of history has been cultural regression? "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 47 FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR Wherever we look, regression is evid ent. If there be any doubt, take these twenty-three examples. Skim through, if you wish. There’s quite enough to prove it. 1. Digging to the lowest depths, archaeologists repeatedly come upon a city complex architecturally superior to later cities on the same site. 2. The medicine of ancient Egypt was, generally speaking, far superior to that practiced in Europe during th e Middle Ages. Pre-Incan medical surgery was superior to that of the Peruvian Inca. 3. The oceangoing vessels employed by the ancient explorers were large, strong and immensely superior to the craft possessed by medieval Europeans. 4. The earliest ancient maps were drawn with the greatest precision—and superior to later navigational charts. 5. The old Maya calendar is superior to our own. 6. It can be demonstrated that many languages have suffered degeneration. 7. Ancient set building stones are much larger and more difficult to transport than those of subsequent cultures. 8. In dynamic realism, the masterpiec es of the Cro-Magnon cave artists of Altamira (Spain) and Lascaux (France) were superior to the paintings and sculptures of later civilizations. 9. Roads: Britain’s prehistoric Icknield Way (running 200 miles, in places as wide as a four-lane highway) is superior to any road constructed by the later Romans. 10. Mathematics: Whereas very ancient cultures knew about zero (the secret ingredient in advanced mathematics), frequently, as decadence occurred, they forgot it. The Babylonians, for example, wrote it as a blank space—a practice which eventually di sappeared. The same retrograde process occurred in China. 11. Astronomy: Originally, constellations took the form of animals, making it easier to remember and identif y them; however, as civilization retrogressed, they actually became animals, heroes or gods. 12. Scientific compasses, which pointed due north and south, were later preserved as magic, through which Ch inese necromancers told fortunes. 13. Crete: The earliest Cretan empire was mo re culturally advanced than the empire which followed it (featuring running water, the most modem bathroom facilities, tinted-glass goblets, glazed dinnerware and elaborate dress styles)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 48 14. Canary Islands: Considerable cultural deteri oration operated until (by the time the Spaniards discovered th em in the fourteenth century) warfare was being waged with st ones and wooden weapons. They preserved the memory of a great civilization of cities, but were no longer capable of constructing anything more than simple huts. 15. The Pacific: On most islands of Polynesia and Micronesia are remains of cities, temples, harbors and statues, whose size and elaborate architecture indicate a civilization in comparably more advanced than exists there today. 16. Pakistan: The lowest strata of the remains of Mohenjo-Daro show a more developed art than the upper layers. Later the quality of the commercial seals fell off sadly. The soapstone was replaced by common clay; and crude geometric shapes replaced the lifelike engravings. Highly glazed ceramics were supplanted by plain clumsy pots. The city’s systematic plan gave way to shabby structures and mere hovels at the topmost stratum. From a high early peak of technology, it then progressed no further. Everything, was done in imitation of the old techniques. Even the bricks were inferior. 17. Central America: The present-day descendants of what was once the greatest empire in the Americas (the Maya) are mere jungle savages, unable to read or write their ancestors’ hieroglyphics; unable to construct large buildings, much less whole cities. 18. Egypt declined from technical sophistication to a vague shadow of its former glory. Earliest pyramid construction was superior to later pyramid construction; succeeding pyramids are clumsy imitations. Even construction methods changed (from levitation science to build the Great Pyramid in the Fourth Dynasty, to a balance of levers and pulleys a thousand years later in the Twelfth Dynasty). The workmanship level of jewelry as well as architecture was higher in earlier periods (everything being more perfectly made and more beautiful). On top of that, later generations suffered a decline in lifestyle. 19. Sumeria, extensive and all-encompassing, was in many respects more advanced than the cultures which followed it. 20. Greece: A city of the third millennium B.C. now at the bottom of Lake Copias (the legendary Copae destro yed by Hercules?) possesses a titanic complex of rock-hewn passages said to be beyond the capabilities of either classical or modern Greece. 21. Bulgaria: Grave excavations at Karanova have revealed an extraordinarily rich and complex technology of 3000 B.C. far in advance of later achievements in Europe."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 49 22. Peru: Pre-Inca buildings and art were of a much higher level than those of the Incas. Furthermore, while mo re recent Spanish buildings collapse today in earthquakes, both the Inca and pre-Inca constructions survive them intact. 23. Easter Island statues of more recent times appear to be imperfect copies of the first creations. (And they have suffered most from erosion, whereas those from the archaic period ha ve remained intact.) Again, the earliest settlement on the island was more remarkably developed than its two later successors. Do you see? it is not at all obvious that mankind is progressing; historically, degeneration has been the trend. PHYSICAL DEGENERATION ALSO On the third day of our deliberations, the Jigsaw Team turned its attention to this question. Perch set the pace. “I’ll grant that culturally and morally we tend to retrogress,” he said. “But let’s look at th e physical side. Surely in this sense we’re improving, right?” “Sorry, Charlie.” It was Wajsmann sp eaking. “Here again, according to demonstrated science, the opposite appears to be true. “For what it’s worth, the skull capacity (with its inferred brain size) of Cro-Magnon man was at least equal to a nd sometimes superior to our own. “Neanderthal (‘Stone Age’) man had an appreciably larger cranium (1,600 cubic centimeters) than that of modern man. “The cranial capacity of ancient man in Morocco (called ‘Mouillans’ by anthropologists) measured an average 2,000 cubic centimeters, compared to modern man’s cranial size of about 1,400 cubic centimeters. “I suggest to you that the downward spiral of intellectual capacity began soon after the Deluge. “Mankind today is no more intelligent than he was a thousand years ago, hut we have accumulated more technol ogy. We have the accumulated knowledge of the past upon which we can draw and make improvements.” (I had to agree with Wajsmann. Most people would be shocked if they knew that a general regression is lik ewise evident in a good many species, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.) “Ok, out with it,” demanded Perch. “Where’s the evidence?” I proceeded. “Agassiz was one of th e first to observe that in many instances the fish of extinct species were better developed and appeared"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 50 ‘more advanced’ than later species, th e modern included. Agassiz spoke as an authority in his field. Many be tter developed mammals likewise became extinct. 1 Similar observations have been ma de regarding practically all of today’s life-forms. “But there’s more. While the fossil record presents better developed specimens than those now living, another feature—larger size—has been observed in association. Do you see what we have here? “This is a blow to the evolutionary concept. ‘Cope’s Law’ presumed that the evolutionary series would show increase in improvement and size as time went on. “Darwin found himself at a loss to explain how ‘now we find mere pigmies compared with th e antecedent allied races.’” 2 Perch leaned forward. “So you’re saying that today’s animals were once larger? Like sheep as big as horses?” “Yes, Charlie. That’s the evidence.” “What about man?” At that moment, Corderoy shuffled a newspaper noisily, eliciting a frown from Denise. “How about this?” he crooned. “Just yesterday, October 19, in Nairobi, museum director Richard Leakey showed off an ancient skeleton of a twelve-year-old boy. Commenting on widely held scientific beliefs that man’s ancestors were smaller than modern man, Leakey said: ‘This specimen confirms early hints that Homo erectus individuals were fully as tall as modern people. We can now ask if many modern populat-ions are smaller than their early ancestors and if so why.’” 3 I thanked Corderoy and continued. “We can go further and say with Dr. Louis Burkhatter that the ‘existence of gigantic human beings (in the past) must be considered as a scientifically assured fact.’” 4 “Did you know that on every continent are uncovered not only artifacts, but footprints, skulls and skeletons of humans who far exceeded us in stature?” “Wasn’t aware of that,” said Perch. “These are well documented. In fact, a fresh look at the fossils led Weidenreich, of Manhattan’s American Museum of Natural History, to the belief that ‘gigantism and massiveness may have been a general or at least a widespread character of early mankind.’” 5 “That’s staggering,” gasped Perch. “But it does support the Genesis line that ‘there were giants in the earth in those days.’ 6 Yet surely, wouldn’t large size be inefficient due to gravitational factors?” “Not necessarily, Charlie. You see, the basic characteristics of gravity still elude analysis by modern physics. A number of scientists now believe that electromagnetic energy supersedes the orthodox laws of gravity."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 51 “Larger size may have been to man’s b est advantage. There is scientific reason to believe that gigantic size a nd long life go together. The body cells become lighter, the blood moves more freely, there is less fatigue and the body wears out more slowly.” 7 Wajsmann broke in. “Let’s not forget, the concept of an era when mankind lived longer does persist in the memory of most races. And scientific research in several countri es suggests that life spans of several centuries are possible under certain conditions.” 8 “A combination of factors such as apparently obtained before the Deluge?” asked Heron. “Well, it appears settled then. Man was once a higher, superior being—certainly not a species of the monkey family. We are only a shade of the original man.” Denise had been scribbling madly. Just then her stomach rumbled and she glanced hastily at her Cartie r. “Goodness, it’s lunchtime!” she exclaimed. “Shall I sum up?” We nodded. “I suppose we must face it,” she sighed. “We live today in a zoologically impoverished world. The fossil remains show that in the past plants and animals alike were (1) more widely distributed; (2) of greater variety; and (3) greater in both size and quality. Humans likewise were superior, even to living longer. “That’s it, guys. Physical degeneration, and not evolutionary improvement, is the story of life on this planet. You might say, like a clock once wound up, but now running down.” THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS We adjourned. “It’s in the first two laws of thermodynamics,” mused Wajsmann aloud as he pressed the elevator button. “I beg your pardon, Jacob?” asked Perch. “You must have heard of them. They’re the two most basic and certain of all laws of modem physical science.” Perch looked blank. “Well, the first is the law of energy conservation. You see, although energy can be converted from one form to another, the total amount remains unchanged—that is, energy is being neither created nor destroyed at present.” “The second is the law of decay. It affirms that although the total amount remains unchanged, there is alwa ys a tendency for it to become less available for useful work.”"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 52 Just then the elevator door opened, and we filed in. (Something flicked on in my cortex ju st then and I began to see what he was getting at. I recalled a statement by Harvard physicist, P.W. Bridgman. He had stressed the importance and universality of these laws: “The two laws of thermodynamics are...accepted by physicists as perhaps the most secure generalisations from experience that we have,” he had said. “The physicist does not hes itate to apply the two laws to any concrete physical situation in the co nfidence that nature will not let him down.” 9 (Significantly, these laws of thermodynamics applied not only in physics and chemistry but also in biology and geology. They had always proved valid wherever tested.) Again the elevator door slid open. “Look,” asked Perch, “would you care to explain the significance of this?” “Very well, back in the room. Let’s eat first.” “Better still,” chirped Denise, “suppose we ride the cable car to the Peak and discuss it up there.” “Fine,” beamed Heron. An hour later, the heart-stopping vista of Hong Kong harbor sprawled far below us. A few nostalgic mome nts elapsed conversing on our favorite beauty spots. Then we settled with a dessert and resumed the subject of the morning. Perch asked Wajsmann about the second law. “Well,” said Jacob, “it’s quite simple. The second law of thermodynamics affirms that there is a universal tendency toward deterioration; a transition from a more orderly state, to a less orderly state, to deenergization. “Left to themselves, things tend to fall apart and reach a state of chaos. Consequently, where chromosome and gene mutations occur, they are almost always detrimental, rather than beneficial. “I rather like the way Isaac Asimov puts it: ‘As far as we know, all changes are in the direction of increasing entropy, of increasing disorder, of increasing randomness, of running down.’” 10 Perch snapped his fingers. “I see! It predicts our research. Beginning at the top—culturally, intellectua lly and physically, the race has degenerated. But, is this not in conflict with the overall theory of evolution?” “Yes, it is,” Wajsmann responded. Let’s not kid ourselves. Broadly speaking, evolution implies increasing organization and complexity in the universe and is in effect a doctrine of continuous creation. The first law of thermodynamics affirms, however, that creation is no longer occurring,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 53 while the second law states that the original creation is decreasing in organization and complexity.” I was almost rendered immobile when I realized what Jacob was saying. Evolution is an absolute denial of the second law of thermodynamics. Denise shuffled. “You mean, Jacob, that evolution requires a universal principle of upward change, whereas th e second law is a universal principle of downward change?” “Yes, put simply, Denise, evolution and the second law cannot both be true. As for the second law of thermody namics, it has been confirmed by numerous and varied scientific tests, while evolution is—and always has been—a theoretical model not even capable of scientific test.” Corderoy nodded. “If one must c hoose, it would seem more rational to go with science.” “But don’t all scientists believe in evolution?” queried Perch. “No,” said Wajsmann. “By no means is evolution universally accepted by scientists. Yet it is often mistaken for science. You’ll be surprised, for example, how many people have accepted the myth that ‘science has shown there is no God.’” “Of course,” Perch admitted. “E volution is the kingpin of modern atheism and world communism.” “I’m telling you, however,” said Wajsma nn, “evolution is in trouble. No matter how enthusiastically it tries to sell its speculations, something in nature keeps standing up and saying No! The two great universal principles of thermodynamics—energy conservati on and deterioration—bear witness to the scientific necessity of an original creation. “Charlie, deep down you’re still a detective. Pick the flaws in it!” So the afternoon sped...as some cherished theories crumbled under a growing weight of evidence. All considered, it suggested the following conclusion: Biblical statements as to the destiny of man throughout history appear to have more relevance than they have been given credit for. For example: the Genesis assertion that God ‘finished” creating and “rested” (i.e., ceased) from all His work of creation, 11 is a simple statement that the processes of creation no longer operate, a fact which is thoroughly verified by the two universal laws of thermodynamics. And when the Bible claims that since man’s severance of communication with the Infinite, this earth has become “subjected” to the “bondage of decay” for the present age, 12 it is telling us that creative processes have been replaced by deteriorative processes implicit in the second law of thermodynamics. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 54 "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 55 In short, the biblical record, once dism issed in favor of evolution, is now seen to rest upon scientific foundations. At least since the time of Sir Isaac Newton, we have known that the universe is running down. British res earch scientist Dr. Alan Hayward, in his book God Is, put it this way: 13 So the universe is rather like a ship in mid-ocean, with its fuel tanks half full and its stores half consumed. In the case of the ship we know that somebody must have fuelled and provisioned it at the start of the voyage. But who originally filled up the ‘fuel tanks’ of the universe with hydrogen fuel, and provided all the necessary conditions for that fuel to be turned into heat at an appropriate rate? There are still a great many scientists who answer that question the same way as Newton did: the Creator."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 56"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 57  Chapter 6  LOST SURVIVORS ay, would you repeat that?” sniffled the clerk. “It’s this darned hay fever.” The transmitter crackled: “Enemy eagle, approaching from the west.” The attendant reached for his Strategic Alert button...and paused. “A single aircraft? It’s just a reconnaissance,” he shrugged. It was 7:55 AM. Four miles from town, a young hairdresser was serving scrambled eggs to her three-year-old. Mindful of an appointment, she glanced at the time— 8:20 AM. That moment was to leave her shocked for life. Suddenly, a brilliant white flash lit up the room; seconds later a searing blast knocked her flat. As it subsided, she struggled, stunned, to the window. An incandescent column of smoke and flame “as bright as ten thousand suns” rose in all its splendor. Tran sfixed, she watched as blood-colored clouds swept down onto the earth. Fierce winds began to blow. Nearer the city, eyewitnesses wandere d dazed. “Thousands of corpses burnt to ashes”...“in a few hours, all foodstuffs infected”...and shortly the nightmare symptoms of radiation sickness. “Never before have we seen such an awful weapon, and never before have we heard of such a weapon.” The essence of this account I have drawn from an ancient document, a document that couldn’t possibly exist...but does.

Small groups of survivors set out to begin life once more in the jungles and mountains that were untouched by radiation and ruin. Without industry, they were compelled to concentrate on producing their own essentials. The emphasis reverted to agricultural self-sufficiency. Although their members had skills, there were too few of them to create a new civilization within the void they were forced to face. Every culture requires a certain density of population. This was no longer available, so they were forced into a more basic existence. It happened all over the world at once. (And will historians please explain it?) All the world’s major agri cultural centers suddenly appeared in different places about the same time. These new agricultural centers app eared in northeastern China, southeastern Asia, northeastern Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. What is more, they all sprang up in close proximity to areas which had been destroyed by some fiery holocaust (that is, the Gobi and Indian civilization centers, the Death Vall ey ruins, the melted facade of Sacsahuaman and the vitrified ruins in the Brazilian jungle). Were some of these new “primitive” communities survivors of man- made catastrophe? In a downstairs lounge the next morning, we were approached by Reginald Stokes, a Canadian doctor who had overheard our conversation. He tossed up some lively questions to us. “I saw this movie,” said Stokes. “20,000 B.C. it was called. The film showed early humans as pitiful ‘ape men’ who devoured big chunks of rotten meat with savage grunts and dragged their women around by the hair. “That’s one piece of your jigsaw picture that doesn’t fit. Just where do you slot cavemen and primitive societies? They were our ancestors, weren’t they?” Wajsmann flashed a reply. “I tell you, Reg. they were educated people just like us.” “What do you mean? Civilized?” His eyes narrowed. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 59 Fig. 6-1. The Post-Babel civilization and earlie st known agricultural centers.

Rather, they are the wreckage of more highly developed societies, forced by various circumstan ces such as natural disasters to lead a much simpler, less developed way of life.” And who reached that conclusion?” None other than a recent conference of anthropologists.” “Urrrh,” grunted the doctor. “Look here, mind if I join you in your apartment this afternoon? There seems more to this caveman stunt than meets the eye.” We invited him to be there at three o’clock. “Hurry, Jay. How much longer will you be? Breakfast will spoil.” The refugee wife was well seasoned to th is routine since settling into their makeshift hut in the hills. Her city lif e was now just a distant dream. This morning, you could hardly say the same for her husband. He had just cut his chin on an improvised razor. “Ah, that’s better. Nothing like a da ub of clay to stop the bleeding.” Jay dropped the offending razor onto a bench in the work cave and stumbled over the mossy rocks to join his family. Now, did you notice something about this caveman? That’s right. He felt a compulsive need to shave! The telltale sign of his habit was left behind in the Lazzaretto Grottoes, near Nice, in France. A small deer-bone handle has since been found within the cave complex. The handle is skillfully split with scapula bones inserted—a prehistoric razor. Here is evidence of men conscious of their civilized background, compelled to use all their technical skill in a savage and hostile environment; men able to make contact with other civilized people once, but afterwards isolated and forced to make use of crude implements for survival. The story is the same on the other side of the world. In the Subis Mountains of West Borneo, a network of caves hollowed out on a cathedral- like scale contained fabrics of extreme fineness and delicacy. Here is further proof of a civilized background. Charles Berlitz notes that many artifacts now found suggest a concern with ceremony, art and adornment, “as if they were trying to combine an art that was natural to them with a su rvival technique that had become necessary.” 1 "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 61 ...True to his word, at three sharp the doctor was rapping on our door. We seated Stokes with a tomato juice. He couldn’t wait to begin. “Now, how can you possibly know,” ask ed Stokes, “that cavemen were anything but evolving savages?” Wajsmann tossed a teaser. “They have told us, themselves.” “You’re kidding, of course. Wajsmann smiled. “For one thing, their art. It shows that their background was as developed as ours.” Then taking a chalk to his portable blackboard, Wajsmann wrote: QUALITY OF CAVEMAN ART “There are six things I’d like you to note,” he began. 1. The rock paintings of animals in the caves of Altamira, Lascaux, Ribadasella and others, I tell you, are masterpieces of art in any period. The realism and beauty of these cave paintings show artistic talent immensely superior to that of the animal paintings of Egypt, Babylon or Greece. 2. Paintings in the cave of Altamira (near Santander, Spain) are, from the aesthetic viewpoint, just as good as modern paintings! 3. Cave paintings in Algeria, Libya and Lascaux bear witness to a developed culture which used perspective and freeness of form—an amazingly sophisticated art. You realize that perspective was not used until the fifteenth century! 4. And do you know that cave drawings followed a planned pattern of figurative arrangement that is remarkably constant throughout western Europe? In each case the decorated cave was divided up according to some unknown metaphysical system. 5. Not only that, but cave paintings (as to motifs and themes) have a common style worldwide. It’s as though they came from a common school. 6. The original caves of Montignac-L ascaux (now closed to the public) have been called “the Sistine Chapel of prehistory” for the beauty of their paintings. The artists achieved a remarkable three-dimensional effect by using the natural contours of rock. This is what they did: small holes became the glaring eyes of a bison; cracks became the wounds of a stricken deer; odd-shaped bulges were incorporated into the painting as a head or back hump. Even today, light and shadow contrasts using the natural rock shapes make the animals"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 62 appear to be alive and breathing. Here is a technique and effect unique in the history of art. “I tell you, these cavemen scaled heights not reached again until late in our era. Stokes stared at the six points. “Incredible!” he gasped. “Simply incredible!” Wajsmann continued. “W e probably have to admit that our artistic capabilities are no higher today than they were in the ‘caveman’ period. One thing is sure. Their pa inting culture was more advanced than that of the average European country dweller today.” (Robert Charroux had pointed out that even to manufacture the ferric oxide or manganese sticks to paint with required a complex, sophisticated technique.) 2 Wajsmann summed up. “Are we to be lieve that these were dim-witted savages, incapable of putting two stones together to build a wall?” Stokes sat silent. Paul Heron rose, sidled to the blackboard, and wrote: CAVEMEN LIVED IN HOUSES “This is my special interest,” said Heron. “Looks like a paradox, doesn’t it? But note this: 1. The Lascaux artists did not live in their caves but fashioned them into an art gallery. Listen. Do you know how they managed to paint those pictures up to twelve f eet above the floor? The answer is, they used scaffolds—and the holes in the rock, where they put in crossbeams for planks, are still there. Now scaffolding cannot precede the knowledge of masonry; it follows from the development of masonry. Therefore we can he sure that ‘cavemen’ knew how to construct houses. 2. And what shall we do about the “Stone Age” oven found at Noailles, France? It was built by using stones shaped like bricks and mortared with cement. 3. At Charroux (a large prehistoric tool centre where you can still pick up stone axes) there are caves within three miles, but excavations have found so sign that these were ever inhabited by men. 4. In Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, “Stone Age” houses have actually been unearthed. These reveal sophisticated construction"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 63 techniques which called for a kno wledge of mathematics and geometry. “So we can conclude that all ‘cave men’ did not live in caves (except in rare cases as still occur today). Most stone tool sites (including the largest in the world of ten thousand acres) were nowhere near caves. ‘Cave men lived in houses. “All right, Paul, that’s enough,” said Denise. “Give me a chance.” Stokes eyed this smartly dressed lady with curiosity. “What do you know about all this?” he queried. “What do I know? I know what they wore, that’s what!” she exclaimed. “Yes, they wore clothes—and how! Here, let me show you.” She started writing: CAVEMAN’S SOPHISTICATED CLOTHING 1. Prehistoric cave paintings in the Kalahari Desert of southwest Africa depict light-skinned men in elaborate garments. Men with blond beards and well-styled hair are wearing boots, tight-fitting pants, multicolored shirts, coats and gloves. A woman is wearing a short-sleeved pullover, closely-fitting breeches, and gloves, garters and slippers. 2. Engraved stones of the Magdalenian period unearthed in a cave at Lussac, France, show modern-looking people in casual poses wearing robes, belts, boots, coats and hats. A seated young lady wears a pantsuit with a short-sleeved jacket, a pair of small boots, and a decorated hat that flops down over her right ear to her shoulder. On her lap is a square, flat object with a flap that folds down the front, like a modern purse. Men wear well-tailored pant s, broad belts with clasps, and clipped beards and moustaches. “Why, that’s sensational!” exclaimed Stokes. “But I’ll tell you something,” said Miss Tagg, almost in a whisper. “It’s highly significant that when I went to photograph these engraved drawings, I was blocked. Just as others before me . This is very embarrassing material. And it’s decidedly not open to public inspection.” 3 “Understandably,” said Stokes. “It refutes all that we’ve been told to believe.” Perch cut in. “There’s a vested interest at stake, here. So many people’s careers are bound up in it now. Lifetim e reputations. It’s not just big business; many of the theorists are totally sincere. They believe they have"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 64 found the answer, and they don’t want someone to come along and tell them it’s all made up.” “I haven’t finished yet,” cried Denise. “We’re all ears,” sighed Corderoy. “There’re a couple of points remaining.” 3. Ancient cave paintings in the Honan Mountains of China show hunters in modern jackets and long trousers. 4. In Vladimir, Russia, actual remains of a “Stone Age” man were dug up. He was wearing trousers made of fur, an embroidered shirt, mind you, and a very practical jacket, with ivory badges and clasps. How about that? “Great Scott!” exclaimed the doctor. “This is dynamite!” Corderoy arose. “There’s more yet. Just catc h this.” He took the chalk and wrote for all to see. THEIR CIVILIZED ORIGIN OTHER EVIDENCE 1. Community cooperation was highly developed. We see this in (a) their clusters of habitations; (b) the speci alization of both labor and sites of labor; and (c) in the sharing of c onstruction and design ideas over a wide area. 2. Another thing. They were familiar with sea travel. At Montgaudier, France, and Nerja, Spain, ‘caveman’ discoveries comprise (a) engravings of a spouting sperm whale and two seals so detailed they can be recognized as male and female; and (b) cavern paintings of three dolphins (two males and a female) in a face-to-face encounter. Their creators, from caves up to a hundred miles inland, would have had to joumey far out on the open sea in order to witness and record their story. 3. As further evidence of ocean travel, tools have been found from the same “Stone Age” people on both sides of the Atlantic, together with skeletal remains. 4. Then there is the remarkable coincidence of writing symbols between the “primitive” American Indian and the cave cultures of Europe. 5. “Stone Age” peoples and those of the ancient civilizations must have directly inherited a lunar calendar system from a civilization older than them both. Thousands of nota tional sequences—such as vertical markings, lines and dots, painted and engraved on stone or bone—are scattered from Spain to the Ukrain e. These are now known to be"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 65 records of observations of the moon, made for calendric purposes—a complex memoranda of lunar studies. Stokes interrupted. “Excuse me, Phil. But isn’t it generally conceded that prehistoric men had only stone with which to work? If, as you say, they came from a highly civilized background, why could they only work with stone?” “Very good, Reg, murmured Corderoy . “I was getting to that.” He scratched across the blackboard the following words: “STONE AGE” MEN MINED METALS 1. The truth is, many prehistoric mines have been located throughout the world. The same form of iron ore mined in Swaziland—hematite—has been found among remains in France, Tasmania and Tierra del Fuego— always in coastal areas. It is possible that the use of hematite (bloodstone), used in cosmetics, may have been exported worldwide. 2. They certainly had methods of transporting ore a thousand miles from Michigan, U.S.A., for not one ounce of the ore was ever uncovered for use within 1,000 miles of the mine sites. 3. As to their intelligence, the prehistoric miners used mathematics and kept records of what they produced (witness bone etchings, Border Cave, South Africa). They had writing (witness engraved tablets, Glozel). 4. At a depth of eighteen feet within one prehistoric mine (actually, near the Ontonagon River, Michigan), there was discovered a detached mass of copper weighing six tons. The mass had been raised on timbers and wedges to about five feet above its break-off point and pounded smooth to facilitate easier transportation. In the shaft lay a stone hammer weighing thirty-six pounds. 5. Another mine at Isle Royal, Lake S uperior, had been worked to a depth of nine feet through solid rock be fore a copper vein eighteen inches thick was uncovered at the bottom. Excavations are connected underground and drainage cut. At one point, a tunnel extends for two miles in an almost straight line. “Just a moment, Phil.” It was Stokes again. “If these people were refugees from a high technology, then why have no metal tools been found among Stone Age relics?” "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 66 WHY ONLY STONE TOOLS? Corderoy smiled. “The truth is, me tal will barely survive when exposed to the weathering processes of time. Most objects will decay, rust, scatter and become unrecognizable in time. Only stone survives. “However we know that prehistoric man worked metals from the discovery of these gigantic mines. “Now notice this. In caves near Odessa. U.S.S.R., were found prehistoric animal bones skillfully cut with perfectly circular holes and regular grooves. Experts declare that these bones were cut with a metal tool, then polished. “It is significant that in regions particularly rich in iron ore, such as Alsace-Lorraine, there is no trace of a culture using stone tools! Yet those regions certainly were inhabited.” Stokes sighed. “Well, that does make sense.” That reminded me of a statement by Robert Charroux. He argued that our ancestors never used flint knives, axes and other tools, except for a few outcasts who lived at a more primitive level. If the use of flint tools had been the general rule, we ought to fi nd billions and billions of them. The fact is that, relatively speaking, practically none have been found: only a few hundred thousand axes (the main tool). not enough to justify the assumption of more than twenty inhabita nts of the globe per generation. 4 He added: “The Paleolithic and the Neolithic have never existed except in the imagination of the prehistorians.” 5 Surely, he reasoned, it is erroneous to define a whole period by the insignificant percentage of the total population. By the same logic, we could say that the twentieth century is part of the Stone Age, since people in New Guinea and Borneo still use flint tools; or the Caviar Age or the Chewing Gum Age, since a few people eat caviar or chew gum. 6 Indeed, you might well ask, was there ever a Stone Age? The answer is, NO! Have there been stone cultures? Yes. But, I hear you say, are not some of these stone cultures tens of thousands of years old? Yet the Great Flood wiped the whole earth clean 5,400 years ago. How can this be? Now you’re talking. Let’s investigate."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 67  Chapter 7 SOMEBODY’S MISREADING THE TIME entlemen,” she enquired, “would you please tell me how old these are?” The veteran Maori guide, Rangi, w as conducting a party of Australian geologists around one of New Zealand’s thermal attractions. She led them to a volcanically formed protuberance and paused. One learned member of the group gave the site a cursory examination and stated that in his opinion the rocks were 50 millions years old. “Are you sure?” she asked. “That figure would be close.” “What do you other gentlemen say?” queried the guide with a twinkle in her eye that evidently passed unnoticed. “Ten million years”...“No, nearer to tw enty million,” came the replies. Whereupon the genial lady straightened he rself, beamed at the three sages in her inimitable style and said: “Thank you, gentlemen. Now let me tell you something. I stood on this very spot just ten years ago and watched these rocks being formed.” MISREADING THE TIME can be downright embarrassing. Particularly for a man professing to know so much. Misreading the time concerning our own origin might even be considered dangerous. Especially if it sets us on a false trail as to who we are, our sense of purpose and what’s in store for us. You will have noticed in the events of earlier chapters a time factor. “G"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 68 1. An original super civilization was annihilated and our planet swept totally clean by a Deluge, about 3400 B.C. 2. The earliest postdeluvian nations sprang into existence ready made, about 3,000 B.C. 3. Primitive cultures were offshoots from th e civilized world of 3400 B.C. and later; all societies had degenerated more or less. Now, some dear person will refer me to “Stone Age” tribes like Aborigines who have been in Australia for 20,000 years. Have they??? The time factor is so important, that if we can go back without interruption 20,000 years, then you can toss out almost everything we have so far discussed. The question is, HOW FAR BACK WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY CAN WE GO? As far as dates are concerned, where does fact end and speculation begin? The answer is, ABOUT 3,000 B.C. And the reasons for my stating this are compelling. Yes, I know that much older dates have been suggested by historians. For example we’re told that man already had a brain larger than ours 60,000 years ago and left drawings in 30,000 B.C. that would do justice to a modern painter. Now think about it. If this is so, then why would man have waited so long to develop cities and the type of agriculture associated with them? We should expect that those isolated civilizations which developed independently would be somewhat spr ead out over this period. Even one civilization from 20,000 B.C. would be strong proof against my account of the worldwide Flood. But, I repeat, th e oldest cultures on earth all go back to about the same time—3,000 B.C. What does the evidence show? For one thing, the written records of no nation on earth are older than about 3,000 B.C. That is generally agreed by historians. But get this. Even modern dating t echniques cannot take us back further than about 3,000 B.C. Dr. W.F. Libby, a foremost authority on modern dating methods, who won the Nobel Pri ze for his research on carbon- dating, was shocked to discover this limitation: “You read statements in books that such and such society or archaeological site is 20,000 years ol d,” he noted. “We learned rather abruptly that these numbers, these anci ent ages, are not known accurately; in"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 69 fact, it is at about the time of the First Dynasty of Egypt that the first historical date of any real certainty has been established.” 1 Does that shock you? Consider the much acclaimed carbon - 14 dating method. This is based on the radioactive decay rate in organic matter. It is a fact that every living thing absorbs cosmic radioactive carbon- 14 from the atmosphere. At death, this intake ceases and the radiocarbon in th e organism begins to disintegrate. The amount of remaining C-14 is used to calculate how long ago the organism died. The accuracy of this dating method has come under some criticism lately. For example, a living mollusk from salt water can show age dates of 3,000 years (as though it had been dead for 3,000 years). Under normal conditions, radiocarbon da ting is reliable to about 4,000 years ago. Then the disparity runs wild. You see, this dating method depends on the assumption that atmospheric radiation has remained constant. The trouble is that any traumatic environmental change occurring in the past would have accelerated the decay rate, adding to “apparent age,” if calculated on the assumption of uniformity. Thus an upheaval like the Deluge would play immeasurable havoc upon readings prior to about 3,000 B.C. It’s as simple as that. Let’s not underestimate the impact of the Deluge. The thing to remember is that this event was a universal catastrophe. It encompassed epic changes: mountains rising and falling, tidal waves rushing faster than the speed of sound, as well as thousands of Krakatoas belching out dust to darken the atmosphere for centuries. Anything that could happen did happen. Seismic and atmospheric di stortions persisted for hundreds of years. Get this. The earliest civilized cultures that can be dated go back no further than the post-Deluge period. CAVE CULTURES CO NTEMPORANEOUS WITH CITY CULTURES And the same can be said for primitive men. Here are some bones found in caves near Rochebertier, in Fran ce. How old are they? “Twelve thousand years,” we’re told. But notice these script characters on them. What nags at me is this. They resemble and in some cases are identical to the script of Tartessus (of the period 25 00 to 2000 B.C.). Are we to believe"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 70 that a script, once developed, would remain relatively unchanged for 10,000 years? It does not happen. So what do the two scripts really demonstrate? Just this—that the cultures must have been of the same period. Do you see? The same is true of Paleolithic an tler bones found at Le Mas d’Azil and La Madelaine. These are inscribed with signs identical to Phoenician script from about 2000 B.C. And painted pebbles from Le Mas d’ Azil are marked with signs and symbols that were once predominant throughout the Mediterranean—again, between 3000 and 2000 B.C. What does this all mean? Simply that “Stone Age” and “civilized” cultures existed at the same time! And, by the way, not 12,000 years ago. Yet we are still asked to believe in a long progression, first from caveman to Stone Age, thence to wande ring hunters, to settled farmers, and later to cities and civilization. I feel sorry for the evolutionist, but that will not do. There is enough evidence now to show that these groups existed simultaneously, each aware of the other. On this point, ancient literature agrees with the latest archaeological findings. Just as even in today’s “Space Age” , there live “Stone Age” tribes on all continents except Europe. Concerning primitive people, Thor Heyerdahl, the “Kon-Tiki” explorer, observed correctly that their intelligence is “exactly like our own “ 2 In other words, ‘stone culture” implies neither “dim-witted” nor “prehistoric.” There’s no 20,000 B.C. here. DOES “APE-LIKE” MEAN “ANCIENT”? I hear somebody asking, “But didn’t the first men look like apes?” Surely the transition to our present appearance must have required hundreds of thousands of years? It is time for the truth. One thing you should know about discovered specimens of the earliest men is that they look remarkably like us. Here’s a short checklist: Perfectly preserved bodies of “ancient” cavemen found near the Bay of Biscay were almost identical to those of present-day man. Fossil skulls characteristic of “modern” man have been found in “ancient” strata in Britain, France, Germany, Hungary, Ethiopia, Tanzania"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 71 and the Middle East. In some places, fragments of modern man have been found in strata below (hence “older than”) bones of “Stone Age” man. Regarding a skull found in Kenya, evolutionist Richard Leakey wrote in the June 1973 issue of National Geographic, “Either we toss out this skull or we toss out our theories of early man...It simply fits no previous models of human beginnings.” This skull “leaves in ruins the notion that all early fossils can be arranged in an orderly sequence of evolutionary change.” You have to admire the man for his honesty. In Australia, an excavation produced modern man and Neanderthal (“Stone Age”) man in a contemporary environment. “This raised the disturbing possibility that there may have been no ancestor of man—that he appeared fully formed.” The comment on this occasion came from A.A. Abbie, at the time Professor of Anatomy and Histology at Adelaide University. He added, “A Neande rthal man in modern dress would not attract much attention today. It app eared that geologists and anthropologists have wasted time looking for a ‘missing link’ between man and his ape-like ancestors, which probably did not exist.” 3 But haven’t there been “ape men”? Yes, and quite simply, these were degenerates from the main stock, the result of interbreeding from isolation. With such a limited gene pool, the appearance of bad genetic traits in creased considerably, producing birth defects and physical mutations. As to physical deformities, Haro ld G. Coffin, of the Geoscience Research Institute in Berrien Springs , Michigan, U.S.A., has a point to make. He refers to “the recent discovery that the classic descriptions of Neanderthal man were based in large part on the (skeletal) remains of...a man suffering from severe osteoarthritis.” 4 Researchers Straus and Cove agree that this “arthritic old man...has his counterparts in modern man similarly aff licted with spinal osteoarthritis. He cannot...be used to provide us with a reliable picture of a healthy, normal Neanderthalian.” 5 Sir Ambrose Fleming asks: “Even if these fragments are of humans and show unusual features, why should they not be examples of deterioration rather than evolution?” 6 Monkey-faced men? Today I saw one driving a bus. Arthritic spines? The bottom line is, you cannot time-slot a man by his posture or by the shape of his head. “Long aeons” ago has nothing to do with it. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 72 WHY THE “LONG AGES” SYNDROME? Most of us have seen those elabor ate charts in books which show geological ages, from the first simple life form to the emergence of man. Millions of years are postulated. You have to admit, they look very convincing to the point of being overwhelming. Once again, I have news for you. With all due respect, these charts, so painstakingly prepared, cannot be further from the truth. They are largely hypothetical, you see; they assume the theory of evolution to be correct— and build on that. They assume that the earth’s strata was deposited in a uniform, steady fashion over a tremendously long period of time. They assume that the uniform action of na ture has never been interrupted by catastrophe. This assumption is called “uniformitarianism.” Let me tell you how Dr. Henry M. Morris put these standard evolutionary assumptions to the test. Dr. Morris set out to calculate the age of the earth from various natural pro cesses such as the uniform decay of the earth’s magnetic field, the erosion of lands, and the gradual influx of chemicals into the ocean. In fact, he compiled a table of seventy separate natural processes of worldwide change. And do you know, the majority of these chronometers yielded a young age. More importantly, the processes showed extreme van-ability ranging all the way from 100 years to 500,000,000 years for the age of the earth. 7 You realize what this means? Quite simply, it proves there is something wrong with the basic premise of uniformity. Evidently nature has not always behaved as it does now. The other day my neighbor assured me that an orderly evolutionary sequence spanning millions of years was i ndicated by the rock strata with its “ascending” fossils. For example, co al beds were laid down 340 million years ago, dinosaurs ruled from 130 to 65 million years B.C., and man appeared just a million or so years ago. I’ll tell you something. In most pa rts of the world this theoretical sequence never occurs. Remains of ma rine and land animals arc mixed up in every possible sequence. Human relics are found even inside coal beds. As if that were not tricky enough, these remains of human origin sometimes occur with or beneath the bones of dinosaurs. Can you see what’s wrong? The evidence shows they were deposite d at the same time—not millions of years apart. The man and the dinosaur died together, you see. (And before the coal was formed!)"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 73 Figure out what this does to the theory of evolution. For one thing, it does not allow for the vast periods of time needed for the organic evolutionary process. The truth is, each successive layer of sediment with its dead bodies was deposited wave upon wave by the Del uge and sorted further by local currents. Remains all over the world—often perfectly preserved—attest that countless billions of creatures were buried suddenly and violently in a water-borne disaster. Animals from different geographical zones and all climatic areas of the world are f ound heaped together in one common graveyard. Sometimes lower strata contain fossils of smaller creatures, while in the higher strata larger animals are found. This is a logical consequence of an advancing global flood. Often the first to be engulfed were the smaller, less mobile creatures, whereas larger anim als escaped to higher ground, to be overtaken later. These successive burials were accomplished within a year. Think it through. I’m not talking about the raw material of our planet, which is possibly some 5 billion years of age. Life on earth is quite a different matter; this is a recent event. (Moreover, if we are totally honest about this, we should not ignore the substantial new scientific evidence su ggesting that even the earth’s raw materials may be measured in term s of only thousands of years of age.) In an interview with Science and Mechanics, July 1968, Immanuel Velikovsky expressed surprise that the body, brain and mind of man, a tremendously sophisticated biological apparatus supposedly spanning millions of years of time, was able to produce a recorded history of only a few thousand years. Doesn’t it make you wonder? Could it be that man is not so old, after all? We speak of millions of years for terrestrial life only because evolution demands that it be so. It needs the tim e. In other words, evolution has an answer it likes, and is trying to make the questions, and the facts, fit its answer. The exaggerated time element must be rejected. WE MUST REVISE PREHISTORY Constant media bombardment has moulded our attitudes, until we accept the evolutionary time viewpoint almost without question. Those who"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 74 influence us try hard to ignore the real nature of their proffered sacred cow. It is 100 percent speculation. It is not within the scope of this work to present the growing mass of scientific evidence for a dramatically ‘recen t” time scale; this is reserved for a subsequent book. Does it really matter what we believe concerning our roots? It does, very much. By having lost our historical links to our early ancestors, we have lost much of our heritage; and in rediscove ring these links, we may begin to find ourselves. As William Fix observes: The question of our origin is of supreme importance: it is the basis of our identity and destiny. The models with which we identify profoundly influence our behavior: the man who believes he came from a beast may be more inclined to behave like a beast. The image is not only degrading; it is dangerous. 8 So now, having swept aside the false, conventional view of prehistory, with its idea of a lowly form of man living in caves, using stone tools and incapable of producing the wonders of the past, we at last see a door opening to us. Now we are ready to conceive of that past as awesome and fantastic—as it really was. Well, almost. Two loose ends remain. One is the “space gods” theory. Could intelligent man’s sudden appear ance conceivably be the result of a visit by galactic astronauts? Let’s see."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 75   Chapter 8 DID SPACE GIANTS EXPERIMENT WITH US? rich von Danicken caused a sensation in the seventies when he claimed that sophisticated ancient relics were the result of a space visit to earth. Now it is time for the truth. Von Danicken, like others, assumed th at early man struggled for endless millions of years as a primitive dumb and stupid creature, unable to accomplish anything on his own. Then we find man quite suddenly (in the last few thousand years) nurturing a technology so intricate, so sophisticated, that it suggests intellectual maturity from the start. You don’t have to be smart to sense there is something wrong here. So, faced with the new evidence of high technology in ancient times, and realizing that man could not have obtained such advanced thinking capabilities and complex technology simply by evolving from nothing, Von Danicken’s camp suggested that maybe galactic visitors were responsible. These alien giants crossbred with primat es to produce modern man, then left behind artifacts from their visit. Did they? You have to admit, it’s an interesting theory. Of the following facts we can be sure: 1. None of the out-of-place artifacts is composed of material unknown to earth. 2.

Interbreeding would have been—we must face it—a virtual impossibility. That’s right. Aliens, you see, would need a carbon- based physiology. Not only that. These giants would need to be physically adapted for entering the human female. But wait. Their chromosomes would have to be in terchangeable, even for artificial insemination. Chromosomes and genes must both match up, which is extremely unlikely and does not happen even between animals and humans of the same planet! 4. And of course you realize that if these were to match, they would already be of the same or closely related species—and man would be already intelligent. 5. Still unresolved, the problem of the origin of intelligence is only removed to another planet. You ha ve to account for civilizations on two worlds now, instead of one, an d you still have to find out how the first began. Now naturally, if evolution cannot account for it on this planet, it is equally impossible to explain a more highly intelligent man evolving on some other planet. 6. Memories of “gods” from the skies are explainable as the recollection by primitive people of visits from contemporary civilizations who had aircraft. Si milar reactions have occurred in our day. With whatever good intentions, th e “space gods” theory was born in careless research; since then it has b een perpetuated through the use of faulty reasoning and sensationalism. Its promoters are correct, however , on one point: Human intelligence cannot be the product of chance evolu tion. Man did appear suddenly—at the top, not at the bottom. Man is a created artifact, far more wonderful than any computer. He was carefully pla nned and endowed with the gift of language and the most amazing intellect , as well as a feeling for handcrafts and technology. And something else was implanted within man: both the capacity and the need to communicate with hi s Maker, the prime Intelligence. Consequently, there is a part of ev ery person which is restless, seeking unattainable goals, yet experienci ng futility and emptiness until it finds identity and peace with the Creator. And that makes all the difference. One remaining question deserves an an swer. If the early world was so advanced, then why is there such a paucity of physical evidence? Four reasons coming up: stay tuned."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 77  Chapter 9 VANISHING EVIDENCE onsider, for a moment, the awful possibility that your hometown was forever wiped out. Can you imagine what future generations might find? Has it occurred to you that our noblest buildings today are scarcely more than facades supported by thin tendons of steel? Even with no disaster, our main cities would be little more than rubble in a thousand years. Our motorways would be crumpled pieces of hardness beneath vegetation. Our once comple x railway network would be red dust blowing in the wind. Make no mistake about it. Few house chattels would survive the corrosion of time. Generally, paper books cannot last more than a few centuries (hence the need to recopy). Plastics will eventually disintegrate when exposed for long periods outside. The same goes for everything metallic. Yes, that’s right. Hair dr yers, automobiles and carpets would be reduced to dust, along with photographic plates and film. What is more, all iron and steel buildings would rust and crumble to earth. Nothing would be left except a few stone structures downtown and maybe a few statues. Stone is the only indestructible material; it will survive a dead civilization. Isn’t it ir onic? Nature allows dressed blocks of stone to survive, but not thick iron girders. Probably there would not be one item le ft in the suburbs to show that they even existed—except fo r the odd stone axe-head.

They might, for a time, be able to salvage and use certain elements of their civilized technology. Eventually the last machine would break down, with nobody remembering how to repair it. The transistors, toasters and x-ray machines, though revered, would be useless. To the grandchildren and their desce ndants they would become legends. The “magic mirror” that could see events far away; the metal bird that could fly above the clouds; the room that could move up and down inside big houses—these would become “magical” myths of a people whose survival instinct would direct them back in to the rapidly encroaching forests. Archaeologists 4,000 years later could claim that twentieth century man was not yet familiar with iron. (If th ey found cassettes with tapes, these would be a meaningless puzzle to them.) What do you think of that? Texts speaking of gigantic cities with houses several hundred feet high would be classed as myths. Do you begin to see the picture? It is this very situation of meagre clues that confronts us in relation to the original super world. I can think of four reasons for this. 1. MOST PHYSICAL REMAINS WERE WIPED OUT Numerous ancient cities now lie below ground level; many are covered by desert sands or swallowed by dense jungle; while others still may lie intact under the mile-deep ice of Antarctica. On the other hand, exposed remains can disappear so fast. Take, for example, the 4,000-year-old ruins of Tiahuanaco, in Bolivia. As recently as the sixteenth century there still stood i mmense walls with massive rivets of silver in the stonework as well as lifelike statues of men and women in a thousand animated poses. Even until last century, travellers could admire and sketch imposing colonnades. Of these there is no trace today. The Spaniards and more recently the Bolivian government plundered them for building materials. Again, many scale replicas of ancient apparatuses probably perished when the Spanish conquistadors melted down all the gold artifacts they could find in Central and South America. The scale of destruction over the centuries will never be known. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 79 2. MOST ANCIENT RECORDS HAVE ALSO BEEN DESTROYED The destruction of printed records has been much greater than was originally thought. The great library of Alexandria once contained one million volumes in which the entire science, philosophy a nd mysteries of the ancient world were recorded (including a complete catalogue of authors in 120 volumes, with a brief biography of each author). In a single act of vandalism, Julius Caesar destroyed 700,000 priceless sc rolls. In the seventh century, the Arabs completed the wipeout. Do you know how they did it? They used the books as a fuel supply to heat the city’s 400 public baths for six months. Totally destroyed also were the pa pyri of the library of Ptah in Memphis. Carthage, with a library of 500,000 volumes, was razed in a seventeen-day fire by the Romans in 146 B.C. The library of Pergamos in Asia Minor (with 200,000 volumes) likewise perished. When the famous collection of Pisistratus in Athens was wiped out (in the sixth century). surprisingly Homer’s writings escaped. In the eighth century, Leo Isaurus burned 300,000 books in Constantinople. In China, Emperor Tam Shi Hwang-ti issued an edict (213 B.C.) to destroy innumerable books. Thousands of Druidic scrolls in Autun, France, on philosophy, medicine, astronomy and other sciences, were obliterated by Julius Caesar. Not one survived. Much classical literature was systematically destroyed by the papal Inquisition. Spanish conquerors searched out and destroyed the entire Mayan literature (except for four documents now in European museums). It was related that Mayan scholars screamed in agony as they saw their life’s purpose go up in flames. Some committed suicide. The Council of Lima (1583) decreed the burning of the knotted cords (“quipas”) on which the Incas had recorded their hist ory and that of their predecessors. What a story of carnage, in which the greatest depositories of knowledge from the ancient world are lost forever! (Yet somehow the Indian books escaped.) Did you know that even of the Greek and Roman literature, less than 1 percent has come down to us?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 80 Is it any wonder we are ignorant of our early heritage? I agree with Andrew Tomas that “we have to depe nd on disconnected fragments, casual passages and meagre accounts. Our di stant past is a vacuum filled at random with tablets, parchments, statu es, paintings and various artifacts. The history of science would appear totally different were the book collection of Alexandria intact today.” 1 3. EVEN WHERE NOT LOST , MUCH REMAINS A MYSTERY Undeciphered still are writings at Easter Island, tablets at Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan, and Mayan scripts. Some finds will remain unsolved forever. There are no inscriptions awaiting us at Tiahuanaco or Machu Picchu. Then there are many museum relics, whose significance may have eluded us. A methodical reexamination of pieces labelled “art objects,” “cult objects” and “unidentified objects” would yield much new data. So would a systematic exploration of museum vaults. It is a well-known fact that museums are in the habit of “burying” objects that do not coincide with current theories, or that are not beautiful to look at. The vaults of the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Prehistory of Saint Germain-en-Laye are full of crates of incomprehensible objects that nobody is studying. 2 Could it be that many objects we ha ve discovered had a purpose that we do not yet understand? The ancients ma y have achieved results similar to ours by quite different processes. (For instance, look at what happened to German technology. It diverged tr emendously from that of other countries in just twelve years, from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was progressively isolated from the rest of the world.) Then again, is it possible that some of the antedeluvian artifacts we have found cannot yet be identified, simply because they are ahead of our technology? A point to remember. As any technology advances, its methods and equipment do not become more complex; they become simplified. (Take, for example, printed circuits, silicon chips.) Such equipment may not be recognizable to a civilization of inferior knowledge. The point is we may be looking at objects—quite exciting objects— without recognizing them. Who would have expected that items in Baghdad Museum, long labelled as “ritual objects,” would prove to be components of batteries? Do you see what I mean?"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 81 4. OTHER RELICS STILL AWAIT DISCOVERY Here is a tantalizing thought. Some authentic and in credibly ancient documents are known to be safely locked away. We may never see them. These forbidden treasures are known to be concealed in four places: 1. Catacombs beneath the Potala in Llasa, Tibet 2. Vaults in the Vatican Library, to which even the pope does not have access 3. Morocco, where Moslem leaders ar e fiercely opposed to making them public 4. A secret place known to a few initiated rabbis (believed to be in Spain) But this is not all. There must be numerous lost cities undiscovered. Hold it, I hear you say. That’s overdoing things, isn’t it? An occasional ruin, maybe, but numerous lost cities? There aren’t any unknown areas in this day and age! On the contrary, there are many totally unexplored areas left about. Quite a lot of things occur in out-of-the-way corners of the world—and some not so out-of-the-way—that most persons never hear of. Still not explored from the ground are immense expanses of the interior of Central and South America, New Guinea, Asia and Australia. Although Europeans have lived and work ed in India for some centuries, building bridges, railways and modern cities, the jungles have scarcely been investigated. There are remote village s that have never seen a white man. In the trackless Central Australian desert, a structure from an unknown civilization was discovered when vehicles from a nearby atomic test site drove into it purely by accident. 3 What you shall see in Part Two is just a hint of what still awaits us in desert, jungle and ocean. The largest unexplored jungle area in the world is the Amazon Basin. This region is so little known that a river tributary 200 miles long was only recently discovered—and then only by satellite. The Amazon system comprises 50,000 miles of navigable “trunk rivers” and an estimated 16,000 tributaries. The jungle on each side of the rivers is almost totally impenetrable, at least for a European. I know of settlers who have lived on riverbank clearings for forty years and ne ver ventured more than a mile back into the jungle."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 82 The Amazon contains some of th e most solid jungles and hostile environments to be found anywhere. Surprisingly, this now mysterious region was once the center of a very intense and highly active population. Large cities flourished here, with hi gh volume commercial traffic to the Andes. Despite satellite technology, we face almost insurmountable problems in locating any remains. A pilot over the Amazon may spy towers, villages or ruins, pinpoint them and report them. A few days late r, someone setting out to verify the data will find they have already va nished—swallowed again by the jungle since that forest fire or whim of weather that exposed them. Karl Brugger mentions that the “Transamazonica spur of the road between Manaus and Barcellos on the lower Rio Negro, built in 1971, was overgrown by tropical vegetation within a year. The technicians even had difficulties locating the approximate direction of the road. It is not surprising therefore that there are no more signs of ‘white cities.’” 4 Again, there are vast stretches where the fog never lifts, and in others it doesn’t clear until late afternoon. There is an area in Eastern Ecuador from which natives have been carrying out thousands of artifacts belonging to what they describe as giant pyramids and immense deserted cities. But don’t get carried away. This is a forbidden region; local Indians still massacre inquisitive outsiders. Intruders in the Matto Grosso region of Brazil can expect a similar welcome. Yes, believe it! Documented accounts are numerous. Once an entire patrol of 1,400 vanished in the jungle without trace. This trackless, unexplored “green hell” swallows visitors. The ruins clasp their secret. Think of it. Five thousand years ago (when our forefathers were supposed to be existing in caves or crude settlements) a highly advanced culture reached over the whole globe—from Siberia to Antarctica, from Greenland to Africa. This super world vanished so comp letely we thought it never existed. It is not unlikely a whole empire could disappear like this. The more advanced the culture, the more easily it could vanish without a trace. If it were so advanced, then its powers of destructi on must also have been enormous. More on that later. What an epic!

SHIPPING SOPHISTICATION ITALY 1 (S): Two Roman ships were found in the 1920s at the bottom of Lake Nemi, and between 1927 and 1932 were restored, only to be destroyed by German bombers toward the end of World War II. These luxury cruisers contained accommodation for 120 passengers in 30 cabins of 4 berths each, plus crew’s quarters; were richly decorated with mosaic-tiled floors; walls of cypress panelling; metal columns, marble statues; and paintings in the lounge. There was a library; a ceiling sundial; a salon where a small orchestra entertained the passengers; a large restaurant and kitchen; copper heaters which provided hot water for the baths; and modern plumbing, with bronze pipes and taps. The underwater part of the hull was sheathed with lead, fastened with copper nails. EGYPT 2 (W): Egyptian open-sea ships were up to 350 feet long and 60 feet wide, with as many as four decks.

On one side was a spindle that set all the dials in motion at varying speeds as soon as it was turned. The pointers were protected by bronze covers on which long inscriptions could be read. It could work out and exhibit the motions of the sun, moon and planets, calculate their positions, the movement of tides and the time of day. Signs of the zodiac were included. To use the computer, one could set a particular planet on the scale, turn the gears for so many months or years and a number would show through a hole in the case, telling you where the planet would be. Here is first-class precision mechanics, as accurate as any that can be made today. This computer was used for navigation purposes; a mechanism for checking one’s position at night.

This legendary “stone” was based on the same principles. It was probably cordierite (from the magnetic rocks of Italy, Finland and Norway), whose fine, clear crystals are better known as water sapphires. Its most important quality is change of color, varying from yellow to blue when the natural alignment of its molecules forms an angle of 90 degrees with the plane of polarization of sunlight.

This is oxygen-poor air, in which the slightest exertion can cause nausea and worse. Yet blocks of up to 200 tons were maneuvered over distances up to 90 miles. In rarified air this is not possible by muscular strength. This grand complex was built with a technical skill embarrassing to us and by a method unknown to us. Here was a city of startling dimensions. Acres and acres lie covered with truncated pyramids, artificial hills, lines of monoliths, platforms, underground rooms and giant gates which incorporate architecture beyond our technical scope at the present day: • Many large gateways were built from a single stone. The Gate of the Sun is the biggest carved mono lith in the world, a single block 10 feet high and 6 feet wide. • The size of some of the buildings is astounding. The Fortress of Akapana, 650 by 496 feet, was once a pyramid 167 feet high. The “Sun Temple” was on a platform 440 feet long by 390 feet wide, composed of blocks 100 to 200 tons each. Walls of the temple complex itself had blocks 60 tons each. Steps of the stone stairway were 50 tons apiece. Here were terraced temples like those of faraway Babylon and Nineveh. The walls of the Palace were 220 feet long by 180 feet wide. Its throne room was 160 feet long by 130 feet wide. The steps from the palace entrance were washed by the lake (now receding and 15 miles away). The paved court under our feet is 80 feet square, with a c overed gallery 45 feet on one side. Court and hall are one single block of dressed stone. • Building blocks: One is 36 feet long and 7 feet wide, fitted without lime or mortar and without any joint showing.

Its terrace walls are 1,500 feet long and 54 feet wide. • Enormous blocks (up to 25 feet wide and of 50 to 200 tons) are so intricately flush one to the other, it is impossible to pass a knife blade between them. One block in an outer wall has faces cut to fit perfectly with twelve other blocks. There are other blocks cut with as many as ten, twelve and even thirty-six sides—and with no mortar between them. Take notice how each fits exactly to the next touching stones, from every side, including the inner surfaces! It defies belief. The whole system interlocks and dovetails, making the chance fitting of each block, or the grinding back and forth in situ for a perfect fit impossible. Even if it had been possible, the power required to do this would be sufficient to supply the needs of a modern city. Do you see the problem? • Within a few hundred yards of the complex, an abandoned single block the size of a 5-story house weighs an estimated 20,000 tons! Yes, 20,000 tons.

The joints of the original limestone casings are “barely perceptible, not wider than the thickness of silver paper.” 3 One of today’s biggest U.S. contractors has stated that we do not possess any machine capable of making equally smooth surfaces as those connecting the stones of the pyramids.

It was capped by a golden point that shot shafts of light back at the sun. Measurements in its Design • The pyramid incorporates higher mathematics in its very design, and advanced scientific knowledge in its measurements.

And it was as an observatory from which maps of the stellar hemisphere could be accurately drawn. • It is so finely aligned to the North Pole that modern compasses can be adjusted to it. • “The measurements of its sides and angles accurately reflect the geographic measurements of the northern hemisphere, such as the degree of latitude and longitude, the circumference and radius of the earth—even accounting for polar flattening. All this data was not ‘discovered’ until the seventeenth century.” 4 • (In the International Geophysical Year in 1958, the exact dimensions of the earth were de termined by satellite, and the French meter—which is our own standard system of measurement, supposedly based on the dimensions of the earth—was found to be incorrect. But more amazingly, the Egyptian cubit—the unit of measu rement used in the pyramid— was found to be exact. In other words, the cubit fits into the dimensions of the earth within five decimal places—a rather startling coincidence.) Energy Fields • Cosmic radiation inside the pyramid contradicts every known law of science and electronics—it implies an advanced knowledge of electromagnetic forces. • An energy field radiates from the apex, which prompts us to wonder why it was built. The mass of evidence suggests that the major pyramids were not intended to be tombs. 5 Speed of Construction • The pyramid was erected at an incredible speed.

Furthermore, engineers have estimated that a ramp to service the Cheops pyramid would finally have had to be a mile long, with a volume of masonry four times great er than the pyramid itself. No, that’s not how they built it. I shall reveal the method to you later in this book.

ARKANSA, U.S. A 27 (S): Carpet Rock, an area an acre or so in size, which recently split off the Petit Jean mountainside, has a curved grid of ironwork running all through it that gives it the carpet appearance. Examination, however, shows it to be reinforced concrete, with the steel gridwork still intact and little rusted (surprising, until you realize that it was sealed from oxidation until splitting off the cliff only recently). The whole cliff (Carpet Rock and Petit Jean) is thus seen to be one vast concrete pour, very, very old. It was the spillway of a vast dam which must have contained the White River a nd the Arkansas River in one great impounded lake. Does this sound like the work of semi-primitive men who had to use stone tools, horses and vine ropes? No. The early builders obviously had sophisticated techniques. In later times, methods became more basic and building less ambitious. The earlier apparatus fell into disu se, gradually disintegrated and was ultimately lost to memory.

Its almost indestructible highways were paved with granite slabs between two stone retaining walls. • Straight: Instead of going around impossible barriers, it plunged through them in a direct lin e, crossing canyons and piercing mountains with tunnels that are still in use today. • Signal stations were perched atop stupendous precipices or mountain summits with sheer 3,000-foot drops. • Raised over swamps: At the standard 24-foot width, one of the causeways rises 8 feet above the marshy countryside for 8 miles. • Superior was this network to the Roman roads, to the Egyptian pyramids and every other construction. • These roads and bridges were built so well that vehicles use them today. • Constantly cleaned, they were ‘tidy, without a single pebble or weed or wisp of straw.” • Total length: 19,800 miles.

With a highly developed technology, the ancient races built large cities, gigantic fortresses and a network of excellent roads, which (in the case of the Incas) were used only by pack animals and messengers on foot. (Doesn’t that seem odd? It was as if our modern highways were used only by pedestrians and horses.) Why, then, were they built? The reason may be that they existed before the Incas and that their builders intended them for large vehicles.

About 1920, eighty Ugha Mongulala warriors tramped for 3 months through this tunne l to emerge with bows and arrows in the very heart of Lima, in a futile a ttempt to rescue fifteen kinsmen. Not one returned. Another tunnel thrusts 1,000 miles northward under the bed of the “Great River” (the Amazon) to the ruined native city of Akahim on the eastern slopes of the Pico da Neblina, near the Venezuelan border, where, according to Tatunca, a light-skinned tribe is governed by women. (Indeed, white women warriors have been encountered in that very region by explorers and surveyors over the centuries, and as recently as 1973.) More startling was information on the existence of thirteen ancient underground cities in the Amazon headwaters. With one exception, these were artificially illuminated. The surface entrances are carefully camouflaged. Tunnels to these cities radiate from below the temple in Akakor. The cities are many days apart. The sloping walled, flat roofed passages are"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 210 wide enough for five men. Each city is crossed by canals carrying mountain water, with small tributaries supplyi ng individual buildings and houses. The secret of the amazing ventilation system is unknown to the natives. Tatunca stated that three of these cities were currently inhabited by his tribe and their allies who had retreated underground to escape extinction. It is all too real, this extermination of the Amazon tribes. It is deliberate and systematic. One’s heart aches to see their grief, their distress, their tears, Can you imagine mothers, fathers and little ch ildren crying out, Why do the white invaders want to wipe us off the face of the earth? That is exactly what is happening. Initially these uncomplicated but inte lligent people greeted Westerners with friendliness, gentleness and smiles. Yet the white invaders were treacherous and cunning. They saw a nd wanted everything for themselves, for themselves alone. A tree, a piece of fruit, some water, a small heap of earth. Their hearts were cold, unmove d, even when they performed the most terrible acts, to obtain such things. Like ants, they advanced further up th e rivers, insatiable in their hatred, greed and hostility. In recent decades, cruel men in enormous numbers lusting for wealth and supported by strong, highly superior arms, have advanced ever further: poisoning whole tribes by smallpox carried in pieces of candy; dynamiting jungle natives from the air, then mowi ng down the survivors with machine guns; and mixing the food of the Indians with arsenic and typhus virus. 6 After five centuries, from a former forest population of 8 million, only a few thousand are left. As the European penetrates ever deep er into their territory and they are forced to withdraw from their last fertile lands, many Indians have been reduced to feeding on caterpillars, tree bark and the lichen growing on rocks. Frightened and confused by this incomprehensible event, tribes have grown increasingly hostile. Thus we hear of savages manned with blowpipes, poison darts and spears, who kill on sight every intruder. Their hearts are heavy. Angrily they retreat further and further into the jungle; and they know that time will soon run out. It was in 1968 that the Ugha Mongulala (a proud people with high ethical standards and a unique written history) made an historic decision. To prevent the discovery of their ancestral white stone city of Akakor by airplanes, the chief’s high council gave orders to camouflage all temples, palaces and houses. This once mighty people had lapsed into a state of dismay and despair."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 211 Rather than fight, they now withdrew within shrunken borders. Only small scouting bands were left behind in the abandoned regions to observe the movements of the hostile whites and to forewarn Akakor of an attack. The situation became still more critical. By 1971, his surviving subjects dejected and discouraged, the prince advised a slow withdrawal into the underground dwellings. The people gave up their houses and destroyed the buildings of their last remaining settlements, so that white hunters and prospectors would find nothing but abandoned ruins, overgrown by the forests. They left no sign, no trace that might have pointed the way to Akakor. Tatunca stated that thirty thousand natives had entered the underground cities. A few remain aboveground to cultivate fields and report on the advance of the enemy. Forbidden to fi ght when outsiders appear, they must retreat to protect the secret of their former capital city. One feels outraged that the White Barb arians are above all laws. As the Ugha Mongulala mourn: they “did not come with good intentions, to assume power with kindness and wisdom. Instead...they brought tears, bloodshed...” 7 Could it be more than coincidence that their inscribed prophecies sound almost biblical? 8 Soon, they predict, a great catastrophe will begin on the other side of the eastern (Atlantic) ocean. “A war will break out...that will slowly spread over the whole earth. The White Barbarians will destroy each other with weapons that are brighter than a thousand suns. Only a few will survive...The mountains and valleys will tremble. Blood will rain from the sky, and man’s flesh will shrink and become soft...Their bodies will disintegrate. In this way the White Barbarians will reap the harvest of th eir deeds...Then the Gods will return, full of grief for the people who forgot their bequest. And a new world will arise where men, animals, and plants will live together in sacred union. Then the Golden Age will return.” 9 So says The Chronicle of Akakor. But for now our journey must resume. From all evidence, I believe we can substantiate the existence of an underground “road” system stretching as much as 2,500 miles from Mexico to Bolivia, with a branch line runnin g beneath Brazil toward the Atlantic Ocean, as well as a number of subsidiary lines.

As you move, they disappear or change into other figures. • Many become visible, then invisible again, seen only at noon, or twilight, or certain other hours, or at one of the solstices—and at no other time. • A figure of an old man, when photographed, changes into the carved face of a radiant youth. How can we explain this sculptural mystery, which is revealed only in the photograph? It is hard to see how an artist could achieve this e ffect even with the benefits of modern science. The artists needed incomparable sk ill to make the shapes appear only from certain angles and under certain specific conditions of sunlight. These examples belong to a vast complex of monuments and sculptures covering a square mile, using whole c liffs; with images of the four main human races and of animals from other parts of the world. Every type of sculptural technique was used: bas-relief, engraving, and play of light and shade. The sculptors scientifically utilized the laws of perspective and optics.

When the sun nears the horizon, th e granite shines dark-red and the various colored lines of the pictures become very clear (the countless tiny crystal prisms of the incisions reflecting much more light than the surrounding smooth areas) and shine intensely. The luminous pictures then begin to m ove. The frog seems to turn into an elk, while the hunter makes a movement with the hand; having thrown the axe with his right hand, he puts out his left arm to keep his balance, as the camp fire flickers. This magnificent spectacle lasts a quarter hour, until the setting sun makes the designs grow weaker. Like neon lamps going on and off, wh ich seem to move, the same effect is seen here: groups of tiny prisms on the unequal surfaces of the designs act like lamps, so that at moments some become more luminous than others. Two currents of light—from the setti ng sun and the moving water—give the impression that the whole design is moving. 1 The artists must have had a clear idea of what they wanted to show, as well as acute vision and steady hands, since a wrong cut in the sharp silica could have ruined the picture for good; granite is a canvas which will not allow corrections.

On trek through the forbidding Matto Grosso region of Brazil in 1925, Colonel P.H. Fawcett, D.S.O., was challenged by native reports of mysterious cold lights in some ruined cities of the jungle. Not only that. There existed, it was claimed, a city still living, inhabited, illuminated at night. Could this really be? Might there be some still surviving remnant of a long lost civilization, which was using “forgotten” knowledge? Fawcett came out averring he had gl impsed one of these jungle cities. He reentered the region to further pursue his passion, but this time disappeared without trace. It is noteworthy that few have ever set foot in this “terra prohibida” and returned. A “lost world” indeed, it is a la nd infested with enormous swamp creatures, wild beasts and wilder men. This region is generally bounded by the Rio Xingu, the Rio Tapajos and the Amazon.

The existence of devices which provided lighting at night in ancient times cannot be questioned, because so many classical writers describe them. I was dumbfounded to discover this.

PRE-FLOOD Electricity may have played a vital role in the operation of the Ark of Noah during the Great Flood. Referring to the Ark, two Hebrew words are translated as “window” in the English Bible. In one reference (Gen. 8:6), the He brew word challon (“opening”) is used—the window through which Noah released the birds. The other reference (Gen. 6:16) uses a different word—tsohar, which is translated as “window” but does not mean window or opening at all! Where it is used (twenty-two times in the Old Testament), its meaning is given as “a brightness, a brilliance, the light of the noonday sun,” referring to something that “glistens, glitters or shin es,” or “a light which has its origins in a shining crystal,” according to many Jewish scholars of the traditional school. For centuries Hebrew tradition has d escribed the tsohar as an enormous gem or pearl hung in the Ark, which by some power within itself illuminated the entire vessel. 1 SUMERIAN LEGEND 1 (W): In the preparation of the “huge boat,” Utu (Methuselah) brought “his rays (of the sun) into the boat, in order to give it light.” 2 OLANCHA, CALIFORNIA, U.S. A 2 (S): Again, regarding that device resembling a spark plug found inside sedimentary stone.

The secret of making planes invisible, and the secret of hearing conversations and other sounds in enemy planes is documented. A description of the fuel power source: “Within it must be placed the mercur y engine, with its heating apparatus made of iron underneath. “In the larger craft, because it is built heavier, four strong containers of mercury must be built into the interior . When these are heated by controlled fire from the iron containers, the vimana possesses thunder power through the mercury. The iron engine must have properly welded joints to be filled with mercury, and when fire is c onducted to the upper part, it develops power with the roar of a lion. By means of the energy latent in mercury, the driving whirlwind is set in motion, and the traveller sitting inside the vimana may travel in the air, to such a distan ce as to look like a pearl in the sky.” The intricate knowledge of aircraft and flying was deliberately controlled by a select few. Precautions were taken against industrial espionage and unlicensed manufacture. The mercury was heated by “a special flame capable of being directed.” (A laser?) Sir Isaac Newton wrote: “Because the way by which mercury may be impregnated, it has been thought fit to be concealed by others that have known it, and therefore may possibly be an inlet to something more noble, not to be communicated without immense danger to the world.” 11 What it is about mercury that could be of “immense danger” to the world we do not know.

When struck by a tiny hammer triggered by the shutter, this crystal converts the mechanical impact into electrical energy. (Why not experiment for yourself? If you strike a block of quartz with a hammer, a burst of power will cause a hundred-watt globe wired to it to blaze up momentarily.) ...Even as I write, fresh developmen ts emerge.

MIGHT ANCIENT AI RCRAFT BE FOUND? One is led to contemplate the intriguing possibility, however remote, of such a discovery. Craft could be of any size and of surprising shapes. Did you notice how frequently ancient flying machines were described as shaped like an “egg”, a “hat”, a “sphe re” or a “disk”? (See items 53, 61, 62. 74, 75, 76, 77, 84 and 98.) While it is the purpose of this work to present positive knowledge rather than vague speculation, I submit the following reports as a matter of interest. Consider them in the context of what has preceded. After all, Professor W.B. Emery, who had spent most of his life digging in Egypt, did say, “There is more lying under the sands than has ever been found.”"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" 296 EGYPT 100 (S): During the early period of Egypt’s overtures with Israel, permission was accorded to Israeli ar chaeologists (if we are to accept one magazine report) to dig near the Snofru Pyramid at Dahshur. Late in February 1979, at a depth of 50 feet, they broke into a cave, which to their astonishment contained a 40-foot disk-shaped craft. Photographs of the craft, which was equipped with ultrasophisticated devices, were delivered to Israel’s Defense Ministry. On March 2, in a lightning raid, Golani Brigade commandos took charge of the object. It was brought to Tel Aviv. Initial tests with weaponry as well as with rejuvenating chemicals found on board allegedly left officials half-stunned. Egyptian archaeologists shortly after unearthed a second craft under the Bent Pyramid and were under pressure to release it to the United States. 1 I suspect that this report may not be verifiable due to policies of secrecy on the part of the three govemments. Nevertheless, some credibility is suggested in light of the following fact. EGYPT 101 (W): While visiting Lhasa, Tibet, in the 1920s the American travellers Anderson and Shearer were shown statements from ancient manuscripts to the effect that an airship was buried inside the Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt. 2 It should be noted that this inform ation is independent from the first both in place and time. BRAZIL 102 (0): Deep in the jungles of northwestern Brazil the Ugha Mongulala tribe have severed contact with the outside world. In 1972, their chief Tatunca supplied to Karl Brugger deta ils concerning underground chambers littered with metal objects and equipment. One relic is asserted to be a rocketlike flying machine with a brilliant golden sheen. It can hold only two men and is described as having neither sails nor rudder. Nearby sits a strange bowl-shaped vehicle with seven long legs which “resemble curved bamboo sticks and are moveable.” 3 It must be said that certain additi onal features in the chief’s account are consistent with discoveries on othe r continents. He referred to: "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" 297 1. Ever-burning lights (see Chapter 25, items 21 to 49). 2. Bodies immersed in a preserving fluid (compare Chapter 25, item 31). 3.

In my opinion, such unlikely elements in the tale of a remote tribesman do tend to endow the report, as a whole, with a certain credibility. Investigation of Tatunca Nara on ot her matters has disclosed the fact that on each point where his credibility can be checked, he has told the truth. On September 25, 1972, at the chief’s invitation, Brugger and a cameraman set out on a six-week jour ney from Manaus to Tatunca’s distant jungle homeland. Ultimately the “green hell”, with its savage surprises, took its mental and physical toll. The two Europeans were forced to turn back when only ten days from their d estination. The chief, garbed in loincloth and paint, continued on alone. ENERGY SOURCES In this chapter, we have detected traces of an ancient power technology more advanced than our own: 1. Energy from sound waves generated by magnetized rods or hammering (see item 98). Sanskrit books state plainly that aircraft could be driven solely by the power of sound, tunes and rhythms. Interestingly, in modern automob ile tests, an ultrasonic reactor attached to a carburetor almost doubled petrol mileage with very little exhaust gas. This simple gadget was based on a system of harmonic resonance within the atomic structure of liquids. 2. The power latent in mercury (see items 61, 63 and 64). 3. Electromagnetic energy obtained directly from the atmosphere (see item 29; also Chapter 27, item 1; and Chapter 28, item 25). A number of scientists believe that electromagnetic energy supersedes the orthodox laws of gravity. The fund amental characteristics of gravity still elude analysis by modern physics. Were you aware that magnetic currents can be used not only to neutralize gravity but as motive power?"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 298 Spinning objects made of selected materials have been shown to generate an electromagnetic energy field when placed in rapid relative motion. If this force field is made to undulate, a secondary gravitational field is produced, which can “neutralize” earth’s gravity. Disk airfoils three feet in diameter and incorporating an electrical condenser charged with 150 kilovolts ha ve been made to fly under their own power. The disks moved under the influence of interaction between electrical and gravitational fields, in a fifty-foot-diameter course. An electromagnetic force field would cause the vibratory frequency of an object to be altered in such a way that it opposes the frequency of the gravitational field. It would act upon all parts of the craft simultaneously. A vehicle thus propelled would be able to change direction, accelerate to thousands of miles an hour, or stop. Do you see, man now uses the sledge -hammer approach to high-altitude, high-speed flight. He has to increase power in the form of brute thrust many times over in order to achieve just twice the speed. By his present methods, man actually fights against the forces that resist his efforts. But in using a gravitic field to prov ide the basic propulsive force, he would make his adversary work for him. If the coupling effect between gravity and electricity can actually be harnessed and used for propulsion purposes, then we would have a fr ee and inexhaustible power supply. If we could thus conquer gravity, the headaches of transmission of power from the engine to wheels or propellers would cease to exist. The oil- consuming car engine and hydroelectric generators would become obsolete. The work of the world could be done with tiny amounts of energy. Construction of large buildings and bridges would be revolutionized by temporary induced weightlessness.

Bickerton declared the concept of shooting at the moon to be foolish and impossible. In 1935 , the noted astronomer F.R. Moulton wrote that man could never travel in outer space. In 1957, Dr. Richard van der Riet Wooley (former Astronomer Royal) called the idea of space travel “utter bilge”. Eight months later Sputnik I was orbiting the earth.

The group was shown by Tibetan monks some ancient documents, whose descriptions agreed with those of Duparc. But here is the breathtaking part: the milky white stone, so said the documents, was “brought from the moon.” Moon rock? Is it possible?

Written and oral tradition is widespread—and, it seems, reliable. Chinese historians in particular never tried to please their rulers at the expense of truth. Death was preferred to untruthful reports of history. As an example we have the fate of historians in the reign of Chi in 547 B.C. We should therefore take seriously the historical reports of China, even if they seem at first to he far-fetched. There is a tendency in scientific circles nowadays to regard ancient documents and even mythology and folklore - as sources of history. Anthony Roberts expresses it this way: “Legends are like time-capsules that preserve their contents through ages of ignorance.” 1 In regard to some of the chronicles c ited hereafter, internal evidence will carry its own proofs of authenticity. My first source is an old manuscript described by James Churchward, the English scholar who wrote decades before people spoke of artificial satellites and spaceships. 2 INDIA 1 (W): Vehicles that could revolve around the earth (i.e., satellites): “Their fuel is drawn from the air in a very simple and cheap way.

Together they look very much like a three-part rocket ship. Another explicit sign is the combination of two words “DIN” and ‘GIR.” When joined together to form the word “gods,” the tail of the finlike “gir” fits perfectly into the opening of the rocketlike “din,” which exhausts fire from its tail.

It was here that there reposed on the altar a “stone brought from the moon”.

The description of this ancient space f light depicts exactly what happens when man leaves the earth (the concep t of the round earth which becomes small, due to perspective as distance increases, and changes into particular colors). 8 BOOK OF ENOCH 16 (W): The Book of Enoch says that in space “it was hot as fire and cold as ice” (where objects get hot on the side illuminated by the sun and icy cold on the shaded side) and “a dark abyss.” 9 "},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 303 YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA 17 (W): Engravings of cylindrical rocketlike machines, which are shown climbing skyward, were discovered on a pyrami d which suddenly emerged from the floor of Lake Kun-Ming during an earthquake.

He explored space by “mounting the current of luminous air” (the exhaust of a fiery rocket?). Hou Yih flew into space where “he did not perceive the rotary movement of the sun.” 10 (This statement is of paramount importance in corroborating the story because it is only in space that man cannot see the sun rise or set.) On the moon he saw the ‘frozenlooking horizon” and erected a building, “the Palace of Cold”. His wife Chang Ngo likewise flew to the moon, which she found a “luminous sphere, shining like glass, of enormous size and very cold; the light of the moon has its birth in the sun,” she declared. (Chang Ngo’s moon exploration report was correct. Apollo II astronauts found the moon desolate with a glasslike soil—and parts of it even paved with pieces of glass. Most of the moon, at any given time, is in the throes of extreme cold. It plunges to minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit at midnight.) The ancient Greek scientist Empedocles had also declared that the moon was made of glass. Such precise knowledge implies on-site inspection of the moon in the remote past. CHINA 20 (W): A story from this same peri od states that an enormous ship appeared on the sea at night with br illiant lights which were extinguished during the day. It could also sail to the moon and the stars, hence its name, “a ship hanging among the stars” or “the boat to the moon”.

TIBET 22 (W): Sanskrit documents discovered by the Chinese at Lhasa are claimed to contain directions for building interplanetary spaceships. Flight to the moon is mentioned (though it is not stated whether this was undertaken or just planned). The Chinese have stated that certain of the data were being studied for inclusion in their space program. 23 (S): Relics on the moon?

If such geometric constructions we re found on earth, speculation would rage as to the men who left them. Not every discovery has been announced by NASA—and exploration has scarcely begun. Already NASA has run out of budget for further moon visits.

The 58-year-old scientist was a high-echelon member of an elite team that has worked together since 1961 when Vostok I carried Yuri A. Gagarin as the first man in space. But Russia’s growing emphasis on the development of a nuclearized “Star Wars” satellite system in space pr ompted him to flee Russia. He now lives under an assumed identity in Switzerland. He reports that several years ago, a Soviet satellite was launched for Mars. It reached that destination in 1982 and has been orbiting the Red Planet ever since.

PERU INDIA SUMERIA 41(W): Brain transplants, the ultimate in neurosurgery, appear to have been carried out in several ancien t cultures, according to written and pictorial evidence. IMPOSSIBLE, of course! That’s one’s instant response to such a suggestion. Good material for a science fiction horror, that’s all. Could it be that we are too hasty to dismiss that which we do not understand? Some recent astonishing developments make skepticism look almost naive. Dr. Robert White of Cleveland Western Reserve Medical School has transplanted an isolated brain into the body of another monkey in an apparently successful operation. Russian experimenters have temporarily succeeded with total head transplants on dogs. The major problem in a transplant of this nature is to make the neuroconnections that will enable the brai n to be supported by and to control its new body. Clearly, success in the West is still years away; the difficulties are so immense. And in a human transplant, powerful moral and sociological questions arise. May I boldly suggest that a br ain transplant recipient is himself probably no longer alive? It is the memory, the character, the personality— yes, the very life of the donor that survives. Well? Now for some startling news. The ultimate breakthrough may have already occurred. In northeast China, during April 1984, a team of micro- surgeons successfully transplanted the head of a corpse onto the body of a living man.

Alth ough both young men emerged from the surgery with their senses intact, attempts to reattach the spinal cords of their new bodies were unsuccessful and the men were paralyzed from the neck down. German cancer specialist Dr. Hans Frankl, in Russia to treat victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, was horrified to learn from Soviet doctors that the experiment had been preceded by at least 14 failed attempts.

And here is the crunch: How could it have been measured without precision instruments? Without sensitive instruments, three one-hundred-millionths of a second would be absolutely meaningless. The only phenomena in nature that can be measured in billions of years or in millionths of a second are the disintegration rates of radioisotopes— ranging from those of elements like uranium 238 (with a half-life of 4.51 billion years) to subatomic particles with mean half-lives measured in miniscule fractions of seconds.

The whole ruin is like a burnt mountain. Even large boulders found in the vicinity of the ruins have been vitrified. 15 What power could have melted the bricks? Nothing but a monster thunderbolt or an atom bomb! Here is something else. Did you know that when the first atomic bomb exploded in New Mexico, the desert sand turned to fused green glass? Listen... BABYLONIA 40 (S): In 1947, archaeologists on one site uncovered, in succession: • A layer of agrarian culture • An older layer of herdsman culture • A still older layer of “cave man” culture • Then they reached another layer—of fused green glass!"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" 329 Lightning may occasionally fuse sand, but when it does, the fusing occurs in a distinctive, rootlike patte rn. Only a nuclear explosion could produce an entire layer, a whole stratum of fused green glass. GOBI DESERT, MONGOLIA 41 (S): The desert surface of the Gobi near Lob Nor Lake is covered with vitreous sand from Red China’s atomic tests. But the desert has certain areas of similar glassy sand which have been present for thousands of years. There are ruins, almost formless, wh ich bear the marks of blistering by enormous heat. It is indeed difficult to believe that once men lived, loved, ruled, and died here. ISRAEL 42 (S): In 1952 archaeologists unearthed, at the 16-foot level, a layer of fused green glass 1/4-inch thick and covering an area of several hundred square feet. It was made of fused quartz sand similar in appearance to sand at the atomic test sites of Nevada and the Gobi. SOUTH-CENTRAL TURKEY 43 (S): At Catal Huyuk, archaeologists came upon thick layers of burned brick at the VIa level. The blocks had been fused together by heat so intense that it had penetrated more th an 3 feet below floor level, where it had carbonized earth, skeletons and burial gifts that had been interred with them. The enormous heat ha d halted all bacterial decay. NORTH SYRIA 44 (S): So completely were the royal buildings burned at Alalakh that the wall plaster was vitrified and in some areas basalt wall slabs had actually melted. SOUTHERN SAHARA DESERT 45 (S): Albion W. Hart, an engineer graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while traversing a desert in the interior of Africa, was puzzled by “a large expanse of greenish glass which covered the sands as far as he could see.” Not until 50 years later, when he p assed the White Sands area after the first atomic test there, did he recognize the same type of silica fusion.

LOFOTEN ISLANDS (off Norway) SCOTLAND IRELAND CANARY ISLANDS 47 (S): Prehistoric forts and towers in Europe have had their walls vitrified and stones fused by an unknown energy, usually along their western wall, but sometimes on the inner sides of the eastern wall as well—so intense was the heat! Many sites show melting to a depth of one foot, “turned to glasslike frozen treacle.” 16 ISLE OF MAN 48 (S): The stones of the innermost cell of a long barrow near Maughold were in like manner fused together. WESTERN PACIFIC 49 (S): Similar vitrifications have been observed in the Western Pacific. PERU 50 (S): At Cuzco, an area of 18,000 square yards of mountain rock has been fused and crystallized. Likewise, a number of the dressed granite blocks of the nearby Sacsahuaman fort ress have been vitrified through intense radiated heat. 17 BRAZIL 51 (S): The ruins of Sete Cidades (Seven Cities) in the Province of Piaui are “a monstrous chaos,” having been melted through extremely high energies. Squashed between the ston e layers protrude pieces of rusting metal that leave streaks like “red t ears” down the crystallized wall surface. U.S.A. 52 (S): In the western United States, ruins exist in southern California, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada, in which the radiated heat was so intense as to liquify the rock surface. • Between the Gila and San Juan Rivers, a huge region is covered with remains. “Ruins of cities...bur nt out and vitrified in part, full"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 331 of fused stones and craters caused by fires which were hot enough to liquify rock or metal.

The southern side of rock and building has been melted and vitrified. • And in the Mohave Desert exist several circular patches of fused glass. EASTER ISLAND 53 (W): Unique wood carvings with Sem itic features show the effects of nuclear radiation on a human body-in variably representing an emaciated body with goitered glands, swollen groi n, clenched mouth, wasted sunken cheeks, collapsed cervical vertebrae, with a distinct break between the lumbar and the dorsal vertebrae, popped eyes, and distended stomach—all in remarkable detail. These are the unmistakable nightmare symptoms of exposure to a severe dosage of nuclear radiation. Does this perhaps tie in with the re mains of fiery destruction discovered on the island? Pioneer nuclear scientist Professor Frederick Soddy (Nobel Prize winner and the discoverer of isotopes), envi saging a past civilization which had mastered atomic energy, said, in 1909: Can we not read into them (the prehistoric traditions) some justification for the belief that some former forgotte n race of men attained not only to the knowledge we have so recently won, but also to the power that is not yet ours? The specter of past atomic warfare is increasingly more tenable as new information comes to light. Whatever we choose to imagine, there is always the hard fact: there is already too much evidence from too many parts of the world to call it nonsense. It is a fact, or it couldn’t turn up so often. The secret was known; inevitably justification was found to use it. Civilian populations disappeared. Do we see the warning? This is the jest to end all jesting.

Even after the Deluge, the reconstituted world system was conceived by races with an intelligence far superior to our own; there is evidence, literally, by the ton that says so. In many ways their civilization was comparable to ours. They had air travel and underwater devices. They were very “modern.” I don’t think you can construct that supercivilization and find exactly another United States. They travelled on a different orientation. Whether in lighting or transport, they reached the same results by a different method. Because of the fragmentary and incomplete nature of our knowledge concerning them, any attempt at exposition is necessarily imperfect. However, the evidence points to scientific knowledge that was worldwide at the same time. And it appears that work stopped on a global scale, more or less overnight. Genius perverted by a ma terialistic philosophy culminated in corruption and violence. You know the sequel. Striking parallels exist between that period and our own. More to the point, there are some ancient biblical prophecies that foretell the appearance in the sky of blood, fire and mushroom pillars of smoke, to occur in that final age when men acquire the ability to destroy the earth. It is stated plainly that the wo rld’s cities will be devastated, that “the elements shall melt with fervent heat.” 1 According to this, we are heading toward the day when everything stops—toward the moment when Eart h’s pendulum will shudder and stop in midswing! T"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 334 There is something unique about Bible prophecy. Indeed, this Book makes audacious claims for itself, act ually challenging the world to prove whether it is a divine message to us, by testing its prophecies. 2 Were you aware that one-third of the Bible comprises prophecy? And something else. It informs us that an unseen Overlo rd has been quietly shaping human history; that He will reveal His inten tions before causing certain events to occur. 3 Come to think of it, the prophecies to date have been uncannily accurate. Events leading to the twentieth century have been outlined step by step in correct sequence. Then there is the current scenario—our explosion of knowledge, the awakening to strength of weak Asian nations, a militarily aggressive Russia, the 1967 return of Israel to Jerusalem, 4 a coming economic-political union of ten nations, or groups of nations, in Europe. The list goes on. All these are to occur against a background of increasing earthquakes, famines, war and unprecedented social breakdown. Then come predictions more startling than fiction! Soon uncontrollable panic grips the nations; they see no way out. 5 A charismatic leader (already clearly identified) arises with “the solu tion”. For the first time since ancient Babylon, all nations are drawn into one world government. (An electronic network already in place makes this easy.) The world leader cancels the existing currencies and establishes a worldwide number system. Every person on earth is required to receive an imprint. 6 Dissidents are not tolerated. For a short season, the planet is “at peace”. The world dictator is popular. The utter wickedness of this man is not exposed to the world until too late. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. World trade collapses, 7 religious extremism mounts, 8 and we are plunged into “a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.” 9 The Bible predicts that so great will be the devastation that unless the conflict is halted, no life will be left on earth. 10 It will be stopped—just in time, but only because of the supernatural intervention of the Creator. Undoubtedly, human history is racing toward some appalling catastrophe. The good news is that the Bi ble has clearly foreseen the events. It does offer evidence that the Creator is still in control—and will do what man cannot do—act decisively to save the human race from total destruction. So, who is to blame? Human perversity is the main reason for the mess the world is in. But, you ask. Is it lik ely that an all-powerful, caring Creator would allow any of His creatures to go wrong? The answer is, Of course!— if He decided to give man free will. Tell me, would it be a better world if"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 335 He had not given us free will, but in stead controlled our every move, where we were just robots? Think about that. As it is, we have freedom of choice. We can demonstrate hatred or love, as we wish. Let’s face it, if we did not have free will, then love, generosity and other qualities would be unsatisfyin g, even meaningless, and life would not be worth living. As stated earlier, man was created noble. He has perverted his own character by misusing the free will that God gave him. No, you are not in a process of evolution which will enable you to create your own paradise here on earth. Such a philosophy is dange rous; it will lull millions into being unprepared for the climactic events ahead. As the prophecies lead us unerringly along the trail toward Armageddon, the Flood of Noah sounds a warning. 11 The information we have dug up concerning our past sudde nly becomes relevant, like a time bomb ready to explode. But after D-Day—what then? For those who choose it and qualify, there is a new world...a world in which eternal youth, loving concern and security are the norm; where transformed individuals are able to live in harmony. If all this be true, then I suppose people aplenty are going to miss out. And wouldn’t some of them just love to be there! Think of it—a whole new world to mess up!"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 336"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" 337 APPENDIX Notes on the Crespi Collection (A) The Genuine ichard Wingate, in Lost Outpost of Atlantis, offers evidence for the authenticity of the bulk of the Crespi Collection. He writes: • “Similar epigraphy in Father Cresp i’s collection was also labelled a clumsy Indian fraud until better trained scholars discovered some inscriptions were written in classi cally pure Egyptian hieroglyphics, Egyptian hieratic, Libyan and Celt-Iberian, and Punic.” (p. 108) • Concerning the large numbers of brass and bronze high-pressure air pipes: Such pipes simply can’t be purchased in Ecuador today...We were told by importers that we would have to special order pipes of these specifications from Germany, and the cost would be substantial. These technological ar tifacts, of course, don’t fetch high prices on the market.” (p. 139) • Concerning artifacts that are made of pure or alloyed gold: The native gold panners “hardly have the leisure or the inclination to fake heavy artifacts of gold and then sell them for less than the bullion value of the precious metal.” (p. 139)The “heavy mineral crust enamel coating” of many artifacts indicates that they were “buried under searing volcanic heat.” (p. 139) • Concerning sophisticated artifacts, like the Phoenician calendars, the golden Middle Eastern helmets, the golden armor, and the R"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" 338 golden plaques: these “would bring hundreds of thousands of dollars and perhaps millions on the private market; to suggest that a sophisticated forger unloaded them on the priest for a low price is to deny the greed that motivates forgery!” (p. 140) • Concerning a cast steel shield: “Steel casting is beyond the metallurgical capacity of present day Tayos Indians.” (p. 143) (B) Fakes Regarding fakes (which Crespi know ingly purchases in his casual, humanitarian style, at the same time chiding the seller): “The modern solder and hacksaw marks give them away.” (p. 136) (C) Hybrid real-fakes • Far from creating fakes in order to reap high profits, some of the Indian diggers in Ecuador have cut up and reshaped genuinely ancient and priceless materials in order to get any kind of price at all for it. We have mentioned earlier the ebony column...carved with the Ecuadorian national seal and d ecorated with gold cut from a sheet of mysterious ancient wallpaper.” (p. 139) • Picture (p. 36)—“Obviously genuine copper ‘radiators’ were redecorated by Indian discoverers.” • Picture (p. 39)—“Heavy brass ‘bass viol’ a real-fake soldered together from original thick wall sheeting.” The brass sheet metal is genuine and very old, but the in strument was crafted by modern forgers. One can see where existing designs on the brass sheets were cut through in the manufacture of the article. • Picture (p. 142)—“Genuine silver wrapped gold trimmed elephant. Yet decorated with modern brass thumb tacks.” • Picture (p. 146)—“Bottom of tin can. Clumsily fire blackened to simulate real volcanic mineral patina on genuine objects. The carbon on this olive oil can be rubbed off on a sheet of paper. The black patina on most of Crespi’s material is enameled to the metal.” In summary: “The genuine green porphyry patina on many of the articles,...the enormous quantities of cheaply bought gold articles, the metallurgical uniqueness of some of the artifacts (such as the platinum nose cone and the radiators), the Mideastern artistic motifs, and the abundance of artides for which little or no market exists (such as the air pipes and the"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":" 339 ‘wallpaper’) pose difficult questions for those who carelessly write the collection off as a hoax.” (p. 140)"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" 340"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" 341 BIBLIOGRAPHY The Advertiser (Adelaide, Australia).

In the same proportion, the pyramid’s total surface area represents that of the northern hemis phere. For all intents and purposes, the Egyptians ‘squared the circ le’ and ‘cubed the sphere’. “It is now clear, for example, that the Great Pyramid was built with a base length representing the distance that the earth rotates in half-a- second.” Herodotus wrote that the exact slant height of the pyramid is one stadium long, that is, one six-hundredth of a degree of latitude.

This and subsequent expeditions have failed to reach the pyramids, located in eastern Peru, c. 13 degrees south latitude and 71 degrees 30 minutes west longitude. Attempts to penetrate the region have been foiled by insects, snakes and hostile nati ves, with the resultant death and disappearance of some of the explorers. 2. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian explorer of “Kon-Tiki” fame, attempted to duplicate the accomplishment of the builders by brute power, using the “heave-ho” method. With a do zen natives laboring (with increasing frustration) for eighteen days, he succeeded in setting up one stone head, and then, satisfied, abandoned the job. There are several inescapable problems concerning this experiment: "},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" (a) The stone head chosen for removal was not a typical-sized stone. (At ten to fifteen tons, as against the others weighing thirty-five to fifty tons, it certainly was a great achievement, but not typical.) (b) His team shifted it a few hundred feet, across smooth sandy ground (which exists only in th at location), whereas the other stone heads had to be moved five miles across volcanic rock, hard and uneven. Heyerdahl’s “heave-ho” method, if utilized across such a surface, would have grooved the stones with long scars. None of the original statues show such markings. (c) Heyerdahl’s team utilized ropes and wooden poles. However, originally there was no wood on Easter Island. The nearest forest was 2,500 miles away. And ropes made from the local reeds were neither durable nor strong-quite inadequate for such a method. (Fortunately for Heyerdahl’s experiment, he used strong, manufactured ropes from Europe. (d) Although Thor Heyerdahl succeeded in moving one small head a short distance over a relatively flat surface, this does not explain how other large heads were moved 300 feet up and down cliff walls. (e) The statues once wore ten-ton hats, put on after the statues were erected. How was this done? If earthenware ramps had been used to erect the hats, they would have had to be several hundred feet long and traces of them would have been found on the island, but no such traces have been found. 3. So observed Howard-Vyse, who uncovered part of the original limestone casings near the base of the pyramid. Johnson, p. 112. 4. Jeffrey Goodman, Psychic Archaeology , p. 97.

Additionally, Richard Wingate ventures the opinion that where tombs have been found in some pyramids, “the situation may be similar to that of Westminster Abbey, where many historical figures were buried, but whose main function is not that of a burial vault.” ( Lost Outpost of Atlantis , p. 116). 6. An inscription in the Pyramid of S nofru (Sneferu), which is two-thirds the volume of the Great Pyramid, shows it took only two years to construct. By similar methods, the Great Pyramid would have been completed in as little as four years. Furthermore, excavations at the "},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":" Great Pyramid have uncovered only 4,000 laborers’ huts, which in no way could have housed 100,000 workmen. The problem that emerges for conventional historians is how only 4,000 men could build the Great Pyramid with 2,300,000 blocks in just four years, during just three months each year, if wooden sledges and barges were used. 7. If we are to believe in the use of wooden sledges and barges, mathematicians tell us that 26 milli on trees would be required just to fashion the necessary number of sledges and rafts - more than Lebanon or the ancient world could have supplie d in the twenty years we are told the job took. Two tomb paintings of the Twelfth Dynasty which show sledges and barges being employed to transport a few statues were concerned with methods used, not in the Fourth Dynasty (when the Great Pyramid was built), but a thousand years later in the Twelfth Dynasty. Hieroglyphics from the different dynasties indicate a decided decline in the technology and life-style of Egypt after the time of the Great Pyramid. This is supported also by the funerary texts in the Book of the Dead. The Egypt of the history books, with which we are familiar, was but a vague shadow of the supergreat early Egypt. 8.

Accounts of these tunnels come initially from the Spanish invasion of 1531. Searching for the entrances was recommenced by the Peruvian authorities in 1844, after a dying Quiche Indian (a direct descendant of the Incas) confessed their secret to a priest. One tunnel apparently runs from Cu zco via Catamarca into what is now the interior yard of Lima cathedral. Access from the outside world is disguised through a stone slab cleverly sunk into the foundation among the other slabs. Only those who know the secret can open it. 6. According to the London journal Economist , May 15, 1968, the Brazilian government reporter Jader Figu eira related that, of all people, employees of the Indian Protection Service were very active in these crimes. 7.

The shoe print in Fisher Canyon, Nevada, was embedded in a coal seam “15 million years old,” according to the evolutionary time scale (thus posing an insoluble enigma for the conventional view). The Gobi Desert discovery was in sandstone rock, likewise “millions” of years old. However, these relics can be interp reted more logically as belonging to pre-Flood civilized man (and therefore slightly over 5,000 years old). 2.

Kolosimo, Not of This World , p. 204. 2. “Laser” means “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation,” i.e., a reinforcement of light. In laser guns a light ray is intensified through forced emissions of “stimulated” atoms and molecules, and a light is created ten million times “cleaner” and much brighter than sunlight. Ray guns can cut holes in walls, or vaporize objects. Was this the method by which the vast tunnel network under the earth’s surface was cut? 3.

This account of an operation by two Arab surgeons is recorded in the Enciclopedia Christiana , the official Roman Catholic reference work. It is also depicted on an ancient wood carving at the Cathedral of Palencia, Spain. The cathedral’s records back up the fact that the leg transplants took place. 16. Found among hundreds of pre-Inca stone carvings collected by Dr. Javier Cabrera, of Ica, Peru. Dr. E. Stanton Moxey, fellow of the American College of Surgeons, says,...“in the photographs of stone carvings depicting heart surgery, the "},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":" detail is clear-the seven blood vessels coming from the heart are faithfully copied. The whole thi ng looks like a cardiac operation, and the surgeons seem to be using tech niques that fit with our modern knowledge.” Quoted by Noorbergen, p. 156. Natural surface oxidation covering the engravings, as well as microorganisms in the grooves under a fine glaze, as seen through a microscope, confirm these stones as genuine, rather than modern forgeries. Many are still being uncovered in undisturbed strata near where Cabrera found his. In fact, th ey were first observed by Europeans in 1555, and thousands are in other collections. 17. The examinations have been performed by Professor Andronik Jagharian, anthropologist, and director of operative surgery at the Erivan Medical Institute in Soviet Armenia.

Originally, it was thought to be a model of a bird. However, the tail of the plane is vertical-a feature never se en in birds. The glider’s design is ample proof that it is not a model of a bird. Birds, with moveable feathered wings and tails, are built differently from planes. The glider’s design (demonstrating camber, the angle of the wing back-sweep, the dihedral angle, the angle of lift or depression in regard to the fuselage, and the wings formed to create a vacuum for lift) is ample proof that it is not a model of a bird. Additionally, it flies some considerable distance when hand thrown. A legend related to ethnologist R. Baker, by a wise man of a dying totemic cult of northern Canada. 17.

Their features are more mechanical than biological (wing positioning, fuselage shape, front delta-shape wings tilting downward, as in high- powered jet aircraft). From the wi ng edges there is something which clearly resembles mechani cal elevators. The tail is right-triangular in shape, flat-surfaced and rigidly pe rpendicular to the body and delta wings. No bird, insect or winged fish has a tail like this-but it is the standard pattern on modern aircraft. These artifacts also carry an insignia on the tail. On the tail of the Colombian model, the early form of the Hebrew beth (B) appears as an insignia, in exactly the place where identification marks appear on many modern planes. This puts the original aircraft before the second millennium B.C. There seems also to be an indented seat at a point where a cockpit would normally be. The objects are displayed in the Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago), the Museum of Primitive Ar t (New York), the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History (Washington, D.C.) and in Bogota, Colombia.
