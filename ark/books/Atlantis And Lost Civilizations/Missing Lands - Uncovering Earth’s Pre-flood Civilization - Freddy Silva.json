THE CERTAINTY THAT THINGS ARE MUCH OLDER[images/00005.jpg]Saqsayhuaman, Peru. The Inka had no idea who built it either.In 1914 the Dutch Department of Antiquities published a report of a temple madeof columnar basalt, reached by five terraces on the slopes of a 3000-foot tallmountain in central Java. It would be another hundred years before explorationof the site using ground penetrating radar revealed something explosive: thetemple was just one exposed section of a much larger site, and the Mountain ofLight, as locals called it, turned out not to be a mountain at all but alarge-scale engineering project, a series of step pyramids built over successiveperiods, complete with a sealed chamber. Traces of human activity date thecolossal structure to around 22,000 BC.At the other end of the Indonesian archipelago lies the island of Sumba, wherevillagers still use megaliths to build places of spiritual significance in thestyle of their forebears. No one remembers how long this tradition has beenenacted, but local legends speak of unusual, giant people disembarking hereafter a global flood destroyed their homeland. These seafarers moved theoriginal stones by means of some magical force from mountains on the other sideof the island to where they stand today. One such monolith — a granite slabcarved with perfectly squared, level and shallow steps — is identical in designto another at Saqsayhuaman, a megalithic metropolis 10,600 miles to the east, inPeru.Another site in the Andes — on what used to be the ancient shore of LakeTiticaca before an earth-shattering cataclysm rearranged the region — is PumaPunku, one of the world's oldest temples, whose jumbled megaliths reveal anextraordinary level of finesse in the cutting and shaping of stone that modernmasons are at pains to explain. How did primitive people achieve such resultswithout metal tools or diamond drill technology?The Bolivian altiplano is filled with oddities — such as the unsettling questionof Aymara, a language some experts consider to be the oldest in the world. Thecomputer scientist Ivan Guzman de Rojas demonstrated how Aymara is bothskilfully designed and artificial — its syntax in particular, which, aftercareful analysis, was found to be rigidly structured and unambiguous, andseemingly developed from scratch, unlike standard language which evolvesorganically. Rojas proved how this ancient Andean tongue can be writtenconcisely in the type of algebraic shorthand a computer can understand. Aymarais an algorithm with an ability to translate from one language to another, abridge language, whereby the language of an original document can be translatedinto Aymara and then into any number of languages. 1And yet Aymara itself is derived from an earlier language, Puquina, a namelikewise given to an Andean civilization whose remaining tribespeople stillopenly discuss their homeland, a landmass nicknamed Mu that once occupied asignificant portion of the Pacific Ocean, from whence their predecessors fledafter it sank during a global flood. It was they who assisted in setting up newtemple cities on the shores of Lake Titicaca. 2At the northern end of the American continent, the Hopi maintain oral traditionsrecounting the destruction of the world on four separate occasions. The detailsof the second event appear to describe the onset of the Older Dryas glacialperiod some 14,000 years ago, but more to the point, they state how this climatechange was induced by a violent alteration in the Earth's rotation and thereversal of its poles. In their words: \"[the god] Sótuknang commanded the twins,Poqanhoya and Palongawhoya, to leave their posts at the north and south ends ofthe world's axis where they were stationed to keep the earth properly rotating.The twins had hardly abandoned their stations when the world, with no one tocontrol it, teetered off balance, spun around crazily, then rolled over twice.Mountains plunged into the seas with a great splash, seas and lakes splashedover the land; and as the world spun through cold and lifeless space it frozeinto solid ice.\" 3Finally there is the case of Aotearoa, the island nation today called NewZealand, of which so little is ever mentioned and of whose prehistory even lessis known. All this changed in 1994 when elders representing one of the nation’sfew remaining indigenous people, the Waitaha, published their oral traditions inwhich they describe their forebears — a race of gods called Urukehu — beingoverwhelmed by the gigantic waves of the great flood while traversing thePacific, at a stroke placing their account some 11,000 years ago.The Waitaha claim to have originated from Easter Island, one of the world'sremotest islands, and yet they regularly set sail on large, ocean-goingcatamarans and undertook a 4000-mile adventure to New Zealand to pay tribute tothe Birthplace of the Gods.4 How did the Waitaha come to possess knowledge ofsuch a distant land? From whom did they receive the coordinates to steer acrossa hostile and featureless ocean if not from master seafarers who'd alreadyattempted the journey?According to conventional thinking, everything described above ought not to havebeen possible during this prehistoric era. Wasn’t this a time when humans wereignorant, barbaric and lived in caves like wild animals?Speaking off the record, many historians and archaeologists now accept there issomething deeply disturbing with the conventional paradigm of human evolution,one that imagines the slow but progressive linear rise of civilization. Facedwith a mountain of new evidence presented by independent researchers andscholars alike, the mainstream theory of human prehistory becomes inadequate,the result of erroneous assumptions made two hundred years ago that were blindlyregurgitated and subsequently accepted as valid facts. Yet when scrutinized,such assumptions disintegrate like piles of decaying bone.Further obfuscating our understanding of what really took place during thisantediluvian era is the fact that much, if not all prehistory has been writtenfrom a European, Anglo-Saxon point-of-view which, until recently, deridedinformation from indigenous people as mere superstition or imaginativefabrication. Therefore what has generally been presented and taught about theorigin of civilization is based on the assumptions of a tiny minority of thehuman race at the expense of the majority, particularly people whose ancestorsknew better because they were closer to events and experiences that, in time,were immortalized in folklore and myth.Recent discoveries are indeed undermining the accepted paradigm of humanevolution. The birthplace of humanity is no longer seen as Ethiopia c.160,000BC, but Morocco c.300,000 BC. 5 The earliest civilization, the Sumerian, hasbeen usurped by the Marrapan of the Indus Valley and the Scythian of theCarpathian region, who in turn are supplanted by an unknown people who built afactory and trading center in the Czech Republic 26,000 years ago.6 As tolanguage, the development of full human linguistics to infer information is nowestimated to have developed at least 40,000 years ago, 7 while ancient art,believed to have begun with the Lascaux cave paintings around 17,000 BC, hasbeen eclipsed by the discovery in a Siberian cave of a 40,000-year old, finelycarved green crystal bracelet, whose 0.3-inch diameter hole was created by theequivalent of a high-speed drill; latest research now puts the date closer to70,000 BC. 8 And further, a female Venus figure from Berekhat Ram on the GolanHeights was found to have been carved more than 230,000 years ago. 9Then there’s the problem of out-of-place temples and megalithic structures.Archaeologists tend to squeeze them into a socially-comfortable era beginningaround 3500 BC, making the following monuments rather awkward: Stonehenge'soriginal post holes 8000 BC, the Osirion of Abydos c.10,500 BC, Göbekli Tepe10,200 BC, the Great Pyramids of Giza, 10,400 BC, Tiwanaku 15,000 BC, and GunungPanang, our artificial mountain in Java, 22,000 BC.[images/00006.jpg]Summit of Gunung Padang, Java. The interior dates to 22,000 BC.It appears civilization has been a long, on-going experiment. And it emerged atnot one but multiple locations across the Earth, far earlier than imagined and,rather than developing linearly, it has endured cycle upon cycle beforesuccumbing to periodic convulsion and obliteration. Virtually every cultureother than the Western accepts this as fact.Mainstream historians find it perfectly acceptable that ancient civilizationssuch as the Olmec, Maya, Aymara, Egyptian and Sumerian sprang up complete, withfully-developed understanding of astronomy, geometry, mathematics, language,writing, complex mythology, megalithic construction technique, art, metallurgy,animal and crop domestication, and long-range ocean navigation — skillsrequiring tens of thousands of years of patient and gradual development. But ineach case there was no development, such abilities materialized overnight.Cultures that should not have been in contact with each other, so we are told,arrive on the scene with elegantly conceived and identical creation pantheons —such as Creator Gods who travel between worlds on a boat along the Milky Way, amyth shared by ancient Egyptians, Polynesians and Central Americans alike.All these anomalies are perfectly acceptable to academia.The problem of humanity’s recent and uneven development was the subject of aNASA-commissioned investigation that pointed to this disturbing trend in evolvedcivilizations ‘suddenly’ appearing completely developed, to technology andagriculture ‘suddenly’ appearing around 10,000 years ago, and to science,mathematics and astronomy ‘suddenly’ manifesting in hotspots like Mesopotamia,Egypt, Yucatan, Peru and China. 10 Was it all a huge coincidence? Did allhumanity spontaneously experience collective inspiration?Or did space brothers visit the Earth in their sky ships to teach Neanderthalsthe finer graces of civilization?Or better still, was the knowledge pre-existent, the sum of previouscivilizations who succumbed to periodic cataclysms and man-made folly, whoseexistence was wiped out and buried deep beneath silt and sea, evidence of itsgrandeur condensed to myth and anomalous megalithic structures?The aforementioned NASA report was written in 1972. Recently, the renowned spaceagency has become infatuated with meteorites and asteroids and debris whose paththe Earth cyclically crosses, bringing with it unimaginable chaos. A recentstudy by Czech astronomers warns of an increasing risk of significant hazardousand continent-damaging asteroids embedded within a specific meteor stream whoseorbital path the Earth predictably intrudes every October and November, andagain in June. This concentric ring of debris is so wide it takes the Earth twoweeks to cross.11Is the recurring encounter with this field of rubble responsible for wiping outa previous high civilization? Because it does not take a genius to realize thatour ancestors were obsessed with the sky. Stone circle after stone circle,temple after temple, megalith after megalith tracks the Sun, Moon and stars,reference specific constellations, even mark stupendous lengths of time, and yetfor all the hard work involved in their calculation and construction, anyonearmed with a bundle of sticks could achieve the same on their front lawn. It isnot necessary to move megaliths weighing up to 1600 tons — which today only onecrane on Earth is capable of lifting — so that future generations could tell thetime, unless there was a need to have foreknowledge of looming events.Geologists have so far pin-pointed fifty impact craters so massive they leftimpressions greater than 600 miles in diameter.12 Yet despite such setbacks,life on Earth was defiant, it persevered. The mere fact you are reading thisproves someone survived on a near-barren planet and told their offspring a taleof such proportion it would never be forgotten. We are told that since the closeof the Younger Dryas 11,000 years ago, the present geologic period has beenrelatively stable, allowing humanity unprecedented upward mobility — some forbetter, some for worse — and yet this theory is misleading, for the Earth hassuccumbed to a dozen known catastrophes during this period. One of the mostrecent c.1600 BC shaped the rise and fall and regeneration of countless centersof civilization from Europe to the Middle East.The truth is, we rebuild, adapt, become complacent, fall, and the cycle repeatsad nauseam. Ancient Chinese astronomers were well aware of far more importantcalendrical systems than those governing solar and lunar cycles. One of themtracks the Earth’s 25,920-year axial rotation. During this great cycle,stargazers describe a cosmic mechanism winding itself up and unravelling in agreat convulsion of nature, when \"the sea is carried out of its bed, mountainsspring out of the ground, rivers change their course, humans beings andeverything are ruined, and the ancient traces effaced.\"13If entire landmasses were obliterated, memory of such a disaster can take theextreme psychological form of collective amnesia. If entire civilizations fell,they took with them the learned and the literate, their homes and monumentspounded into oblivion and laid beneath thousands of years of mud and debris,evidence of their deeds buried deep beneath our feet, our cars and skyscrapers.But indigenous traditions adamantly state that people did survive the greatflood at the close of the Younger Dryas, individuals of unusual stature, whoseadvanced knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, architecture, and control of themechanics of nature had them compared to gods. Their know-how became thecatalyst for raising the human race from the state of barbarity to which itreverted. Myths were created. Legends spoke of global upheaval as a consequenceof humanity falling out of sync with nature — storytelling mechanisms designedto engage audiences of the future with an unbroken narrative lest the events andlessons be forgotten. Because the events were real and, like a boomerang, liableto return.It is probably for this reason why a network of temples was erected across theface of the Earth using stone of a size beyond what is both practical andnecessary for the singular purpose of marking days for sowing and harvest. Andhow it all comes around, with astronomers and space agencies of late becomingobsessed with the sky and Earth-destroying projectiles, with hardly a week goingby without a press release on the subject.It seems we’ve been here before. And that’s the point of this adventure.If we invert the conventional European model and examine the narrative from theperspective of the oldest cultures on Earth, we receive a different version ofancient events, for virtually every one of them recalls an advanced antediluvianworld civilization whose messengers survived an unimaginable catastrophe anddisembarked at strategic locations after the Younger Dryas to buildtechnologically advanced temples and establish laws which led to the suddenflourishing of human civilization. These gods were described as humanoid yetunusual of appearance and physique, magicians whose island homes succumbed totitanic forces.So what happened 11,000 years ago? Who were these gods, where did they come fromand what did they want with us?"},{"pageContent":"> 2.

And the fowls of the air came, and the animals of the plains and woodswere seen. The clouds... were a deluge. The deluge was all over the face of theearth.\"2 Fortunately one wise man was forewarned, by shamanic dream or godlyintervention, to prepare for the impending flood by selecting seeds and animalswhich were to be housed in a protective vessel. After the waters subsided, heand his wife descended from a mountain, discovered domesticated corn, andtogether repopulated the Earth.In another corner of North America, the Chocktaw faced the same plight: \"Theearth was plunged in darkness for a long time... a bright light finally appearedin the north... but it was mountain-high waves, rapidly coming nearer.\"3As the oceans consumed the Earth, the Chiglit of Canada saw their dwellingsblown away by terrific winds, and as they lashed their boats together,gale-driven waves traversed the Rocky Mountains, followed by intense heat,killing most people; the Sun and Moon disappeared, like all the land, and thefew survivors faced a prolonged and bitterly cold climate. The Shokomish peoplemade ropes of cedar limbs to fasten their canoes to the hills, all to no avail,because the flood waters rose higher and higher into the Olympic Mountains — tothe west of today’s Seattle — snapping ropes and casting the canoes adrift.Neighboring tribes in Oregon were luckier, their canoes came to rest upon thesummit of Mt. Jefferson, 10,000 feet above sea level.4A righteous man of the Yakima tribe was warned of such events in a vision whichhe shared with others: “I have heard from the Land Above, the land of thespirits, that a big water is coming that will cover all the land. Make a boatfor the good people, let the bad people be killed by the water... The Earth willbe destroyed.”5To the south, the Ute describe the Sun shivering into a thousand fragments thatfell to Earth. One supernatural being caught in the conflagration ran from theblazing Earth, and as his own body began to burn, tears gushed forth creating aflood that engulfed the planet and put out the fires.One factor corroborating such accounts is the Great Salt Lake that covers agoodly part of the high plains of northern Utah, allegedly the remnant of amassive body of freshwater created by glacial melt that once stretched intoneighboring Idaho and Nevada. Evidence shows people once fished around itsshores. It is claimed in geological circles that its saltiness was acquired fromtiny amounts of mineral salts accumulating over time from streams feeding intothe lake. The problem is, the salt in the Great Salt Lake is composed of seasalt, and the change occurred some 10,000 years ago — around the time tsunamisfrom the great flood are supposed to have overrun North America.[images/00007.jpg]The Great Salt Lake, Utah. The salt was introduced by a tidal wave of seawaterthat swept North America around 10,000 years ago.Traveling south along the American continent, the predecessors of the Mayarecorded the event in great detail: \"It was ruin and destruction... the sea waspiled up... it was a great inundation.... People drowned in a sticky substanceraining from the sky.... The face of the earth grew dark and the gloomy rainendured days and nights.... And then there was a great din of fire above theirheads.”6 Survivors, which were few, describe the falling debris as a blackviscous residue similar to bitumen, “much hail, black rain and mist, andindescribable cold.”7 Finally, as calm began to return, the K'iche' migratedinland after crossing a sea enveloped in a somber fog.8The conflagration was not restricted to the Atlantic coastline of CentralAmerica, both coasts were simultaneously transgressed, \"the sea, breaking out ofits bounds following a terrifying shock, began to rise on the Pacific coast. Butas the sea rose, filling up valleys and the plains around, the mountain ofAncasmarca rose too, like a ship on the waves. During the five days that thiscataclysm lasted, the sun did not show its face and the Earth remained indarkness.\"9More worryingly, the Maya describe the Sun rising only partially above thehorizon and standing still for days, while the Moon also stooduncharacteristically motionless in the sky,10 as though the Earth, hit by somestupendous cosmic impact, stopped rotating on its axis. Maya recordkeepingdescribes this era as the destruction of the Fourth Sun, a time when the worldwas plunged in darkness, literally and metaphorically, for twenty-five years.Amid this profound obscurity, ten years elapsed before the appearance of theFifth Sun, the period marking the regeneration of humanity.11Meanwhile in northern Mongolia, the Buryat were experiencing a particularlybad-hair day. A heavenly source forewarned a fellow named Shitkut to go into theforest to build a great ship into which he was to deposit specimens of allanimals. Only one refused because it deemed itself so large that no flood couldkill it. Alas, the flood that followed was so overwhelming that even thislargest of creatures — the mammoth — became extinct.Their neighbours to the west, the Tartars of central Siberia, add that a mancalled Nama built a ship with eight cables, each eighty fathoms long. Over thecourse of seven days the waters rose 480 feet, the cables reached theirstructural limit, snapped, and the ship floated free. All that could be seenfrom aboard were the tops of mountains. To the north, the Ugrians and Ostiaksdescribe how the few survivors were saved on their rafts or by clinging on tologs, settling in different parts of the Earth when the waters receded, and forthis reason, different languages developed over time across the world.By no means was the great flood restricted to a wall of mountain-high water, theevent was accompanied by hurricane-force winds. As the Middle East was beingravaged, the flood — Arabs call it tufan (deluge) — was chaperoned by a mightystrong west wind, the tyfoon. Samoan islanders describe an accompanying acridsmell which \"became smoke, which again became clouds... The sea too arose, andin a stupendous catastrophe of nature the land sank into the sea... new eartharose out of the womb of the last Earth\" — referring to the islands of Tonga,Samoa, Rotuma, Fiji, and Uvea and Fotuma that subsequently rose out of thePacific Ocean.12The account from the Polynesian island of Takaofo describes how “the sky waslow, then the winds and waterspouts and the hurricanes came, and carried up thesky to its present height.\"13Over in Mesopotamia a man named Utnapishtim was minding his business when a godnamed Enki warned him to construct a giant boat with a height of one acre, inwhich he was to house his family, various craftsmen, animals and seeds, andprepare for a tumultuous ride. As he was about to close the hatch Utnapishtimsaw what appeared to be a massive black cloud rising along the horizon to thesouth, which turned out to be a wall of mud-laden water. A great flash of lightwas followed by twelve days of darkness and hurricane-force winds, while thewaters rose and overwhelmed the distant mountains. The land, he said, wassmashed like a cup: “On the first day the tempest blew swiftly and brought theflood... No man could see his fellow. Nor could people be distinguished from thesky.”For six days the wind blew while torrent, tempest and flood raged at one anotherlike sparring hosts overrunning the Earth. Utnapishtim’s boat finally ranaground on the hills of Nisir, and for seven days he looked out and saw watereverywhere. When land re-appeared it was flattened like a terrace, withdestruction evident everywhere: \"Desolation... stretched to heaven, all that wasbright was turned into darkness... the hurricane, deluge, and tempest continuedsweeping the land... and all human back to its clay was returned.\"14Utnapishtim’s experience is almost identical to that of his Sumerian neighborZin-Suddu, king of Shuruppak prior to the flood, who may have served as themodel for Noah that future Israelites would borrow during their captivity inBabylon. The figure of a gargantuan eroded hull still lies on the slope of Mt.Ararat, deposited, strangely enough, along the same latitude as Mount Tomaros inGreece, landing place of Deucalion, the hero of the Greek flood narrative.[images/00008.jpg]Manu leading Seven Sages during the flood. Identical groups of learned peopleare found throughout most indigenous flood stories.Somewhere in the Middle East another righteous man by the name of Enoch wasforewarned of this impending catastrophe some two hundred years ahead of theevent. He describes being admitted into the company of seven beings who led thisscribe “to a mountain, the point of whose summit reached to heaven. And I sawthe places of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars... and beings cameforth from heaven who were like white men, and four went forth from that placeand three went with them. And those three... grasped me by the hand and took meup, away from the generations of the earth, and raised me up to a lofty place,and showed me a tower raised high above the earth... And one said to me, ‘Remainhere till you see everything that befalls.’” 15Enoch was subsequently shown the impending impact of a disintegrating comet,“seven stars like great burning mountains... a star fell from heaven... I sawmany stars descend and cast themselves down from heaven... I saw how the earthwas swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains,and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent from their stems andhurled down and sunk into the abyss.... And the sea... is driven forward anddisperses amid all the mountains.... And water gushed forth from above, rushinglike a copious watercourse towards the northwest.”16One of the beings explains to Enoch how such meteorites “transgressed thecommandments of the Lord in the beginning of their rising,” essentially tellingthe flabbergasted scribe how these space rocks periodically become dislodgedfrom their regular course, with the Earth in the wrong place at the wrong time.Enoch watched the futuristic vision of a wall of water swallowing animals andtrees, sweeping across a desert to the east and reaching the mountains.He was not alone. Somewhere in the region of the Indus Valley a man named Manuwas washing himself when a similar god — this time disguised as a fish — warnshim of an impending deluge that would sweep away all creatures. To save himself,Manu was instructed to build a boat, which he did, and when the floodwatersbegan to rise Manu fastened a rope to the fish’s horn and the boat was steeredover the Mountain of the North.So strong is the memory of this event that it survived as an oral tradition forthousands of years in the high Andes. A herdsman saw his llamas staring in thedirection of the Sun. Protecting his eyes with his hand, he looked up and saw acluster of large objects between the Sun and Moon. The animals told him this wasa sign that the world was about to be destroyed by a great deluge, so theherdsman gathered his family and animals and took refuge on the summit of a highmountain just as the waves rose and swamped the land. Many days passed beforethe waters receded, and in all this time the Sun was hidden by a greatdarkness.17Two brothers and their families were similarly advised to take five days' worthof food and climb to the summit of the high mountain Huillcacoto, where theyfound a number of animals already ensconced in the safety of its caves. Theymoved their flocks and soon the rain began. It poured and poured. As predicted,all mountains were covered by water except the summit of Huillcacoto. Lookingdown into the valleys they heard the cries of dying humans overwhelmed by thewaters. Miraculously, the mountain grew taller and taller as the waters rose.Even so, water lapped at the door of the cave, but still the mountain grew. Forthe next five days the Sun was said to have died and it remained night for fivedays.18Those living on the edge of Lake Titicaca, 12,500 feet up on the altiplano ofBolivia, had to contend with the consequences of brusque tectonic shiftsresulting from impact shockwaves generated by incoming aerial projectiles, forthey witnessed the breaking of bulwarks on the lakes situated at greateraltitude to the north, causing the release of a second unstoppable wall of waterthat overwhelmed the temple city of Tiwanaku, tossing its megaliths likematchsticks, crushing and jumbling its inhabitants along with fish, marine life,mammals, utensils, jewels, tools, pottery and shells into one confusing heap.19When the story was transmitted to the Inca many thousands of years later,villagers were still paralyzed by the fear of a change in the appearance of theSun because, they said, it foretold doom. A Spanish chronicler in 1555 describedtheir trepidation: ”[when] there is an eclipse of the Sun or the Moon theIndians cry and groan in great perturbation, thinking that the time has come inwhich the Earth will perish.”20Had these people found themselves in a bar with the ancient Chinese, the latterwould have nodded in agreement with the accuracy of the story: \"When the skybecomes hostile to living things and wishes to destroy them, it burns them; theSun and the Moon lose their form and are eclipsed; the five planets leave theirpaths; the four seasons encroach one upon another; daylight is obscured; glowingmountains collapse; rivers are dried up; it thunders in winter, hoarfrost fallsin summer; the atmosphere is thick and human beings choked; the state perishes;the aspect and the order of the sky are altered; the customs of the age aredisturbed.\"21 The Chinese recorded their most ancient knowledge in the Yih King,a book that is at least 5000 years old and whose origin is as mysterious aspyramids, yet at its core there are uncannily similar stories, for China has itsown flood hero, Fu Hsi, who escaped the rising waters along with his wife andthree sons and daughters to found Chinese civilization.What kind of sky phenomena causes such a conflagration? The Voguls speak of aCreator God who sent a sea of fire upon the Earth in order to destroy thewickedness that had befallen the human race, referring to the event asFire-Water.22 It was a shared experience because the people of the East Indiesspeak of snegle-das (water of fire) that rained down from the sky and killedeveryone.23 In what seems to be a description of a comet, the Voguls describe itas a recurring conflagration appearing in the eastern sky, accompanied by a tailstretching from one corner to the other and the sound of a fearful thunder.Given the vast expanse of the Australian continent, Aboriginal tribes saw theevent from slightly different perspectives yet all agree on the same outcome.The Bundaba tell of a mighty noise coming from a cloud in the north that grewbigger and bigger until it covered the entire sky. Gradually a great sound likerolling thunder arrived, accompanied by hurricane-force winds and the pouring ofthe sea from the mountains in the north, covering the entire land for days. Twopeople survived on a raft and were guided to the safety of Mt Broome. Theculprit was Yunggalya (Running Star) from which several pieces fell to Earth andmade holes in the ground.But by far the most disturbing image comes from the Himalaya, the highestmountain range on Earth, hundreds of miles from the ocean. One would assume itwas spared the ravages of monstrous waves, yet even this apparent safe haven ofhighlands was encroached by tidal waves claimed by Tibetans to have beengenerated by comets that regularly create upheaval on Earth.24Such events are recorded in dramatic fashion in the Kalevala of the Finns. Oncein a while Ukko, the highest of deities, relinquishes support of the heavens,and hailstones of iron rain down on Earth, resulting in a generation ofdarkness. As a consequence the seasons do not return to their established order.The Icelandic tradition adds that a never-ending winter followed the lastconflagration, with only a pair of humans surviving to reseed the Earth.25It seems that no matter who you were or where — the Chewong in Malaysia, theKaren in Burma, the Mechoacanesec in Central America, the Chibca in Colombia,the Canaria in Ecuador, the Tupinamba in Brazil, the Araucnaia in Chile, or theLuiseno, Sioux and Chickasaw in North America — the shockwaves of thiscatastrophe were permanently engraved upon every culture.According to orthodox historians, humans did not get about much 11,000 yeas ago,so how did indigenous people on opposite corners of the globe come to owntraditions sharing near identical details? The forewarning, the heat, gale forcewinds, the blotting out of the sky, Earth pausing on its axis, and so on. Mostaccounts agree that the wall of seawater rose as high as mountain summits, andin some cases actually surpassed them. The annals of Emperor Yao describe thewaters reaching deep into the center of the Chinese mainland, \"overtopping thegreat heights, threatening the heavens with their floods.\" The Vedas of theTamil describe the highest mountains being \"ground to powder and destroyed,\"26while in the Andes the ocean left the shore before submerging South America witha terrible dim, and the Sun failed to appear for five days and nights.27Aboriginal cultures refer to this period as “the time of darkness,” whensufficient debris ejected into the atmosphere would have been capable ofinducing solar radiation for up to a thousand years.THE MEMORABLE POWER OF MYTHWhereas the modern world equates myth with imaginative invention, ancientcultures used it as an instrument for recording important facts and events sothey would be memorized and recalled generation after generation. Such storiesmay seem alien and abstract to us because their social point of reference andliterary construct differ from ours, and yet events were observed, thenpoeticized to give them artistic color, intrigue and conflict, before finallybeing mythologized to imbue the scene with imagery so unforgettable it would bebranded upon the listener's imagination. Thus myth became the memory stick ofearlier ages, a mnemonic device for transferring knowledge, particularly duringtimes of illiteracy. For example, the telling of a sea voyage by a group of mento retrieve an important object was not enough, the story had to be embellishedinto Jason and the Argonauts, later rewritten for another audience as Arthur andthe Grail. When dissected, such myths reveal multiple layers of information:mathematics, astronomy, astrology, history, even a road map to self-awarenessand transcendence. Myth is a method of making connections at a level beyond theobvious and the superficial, an efficient technique for encoding a complexseries of facts, so much so that its storytellers were highly prized becausethey were, in effect, wisdom keepers.Folklore works in the same manner, recording events that indigenous culturesrefer to as \"time immemorial.\" For example, an archaeological excavation on theHeiltsuk peoples’ reservation in British Columbia confirms their oral history ofsettlement at the site during the Younger Dryas. \"It was a place that neverfroze during the ice age and it was a place where our ancestors flocked to forsurvival,\" said William Housty, a member of the Heiltsuk Nation. Subsequentdating of unearthed artefacts indeed places the tribe at this location in 12,000BC, when much of North America was one massive ice sheet.28In many flood myths and traditions the Sun is described as behaving abnormally.It is absent in Central America for five days, while in Persia and the Indusregion — on the same latitude on the opposite side of the world — the Sunremained in the sky between five and ten days, suggesting the Earth's rotationdid slow considerably or stopped altogether. The same phenomenon was observedmuch later in China c.2200 BC during the time of Emperor Yao, and evidencesuggests another meteorite impacted the Earth c.2345 BC.29Ancient accounts also describe a combustible fluid accompanying the globalflood. It has been suggested this may have been the debris of a comet's tail,composed as it is of carbon and hydrogen — the components of petroleum that,when interacting with oxygen in the atmosphere, become highly combustible. Theeffects were predictably devastating: \"For seven winters and summers the firehas raged... it has burnt up the earth.\"30 Hailstones of iron descended from thesky, so say the myths of the Finns, making the Sun and Moon disappear, and theheavens replaced by new celestial bodies.31It would be nine thousand years before the philosopher Philo learned of suchstories during his tenure at Alexandria’s fabled library. He succinctlysummarized how, over the course of long periods of time, the Earth is subjectedto \"fire [that] pours out from above and spreads over many places and overrunsgreat regions of the inhabited earth,”32 what astronomers today refer to as amass coronal ejection, an eruption of plasma from the Sun. Before him, Platocompiled similar accounts handed down from those great students of the stars,the Chaldeans, who were under no illusion that the orbits and velocities ofplanets were in any way absolute, but instead are subject to change andvariation.33 They forewarned future citizens of the chaos such changes visitupon the Earth, one of them being the obliteration of all traces of formercivilizations. Such observations became the foundation of Plato's accounts ofthe final destruction of Atlantis, which the philosopher elegantly wove into adialogue between two statesmen, using the mechanism of creative storytelling toimpart vital knowledge to future generations. Since modern historians fail tounderstand the importance of such a mechanism, his work is dismissed by them asfiction, despite his dating of the great flood aligning to within one hundredyears of the latest supporting geological evidence.Perhaps the most important thing about the flood stories — for that is what theyare, real-life observations — is that they were transmitted by survivors andpassed along orally from generation to generation, eventually recorded forposterity on paper, papyrus, vellum and stone. The Vedas of the Indiansubcontinent provide a highly descriptive, if sometimes baffling narrative ofevents that took place in prehistoric times, one of them being the pralayas(cataclysms) which occasionally overrun the Earth, destroying everything, andhow certain Rishis (wise men) survived such events to “repromulgate, at thebeginning of the new age, the knowledge inherited by them as a sacred trust fromtheir forefathers in the preceding age... Each manvantara or age thus has a Vedaof its own which differs only in expression and not in sense from theantediluvian Veda.”34 Rather than haphazard, these catastrophes are claimed bymany cultures to be predictable, typically associated with the close of a cycle,and seemingly in response to, or as a consequence of, humans transgressing thelaws of nature — rebelling against the high gods, as the metaphor goes. Sincewhat happens in terrestrial life is believed to be mirrored in the sky, adegeneration of society was reflected in the disturbance of heavenly order, whenplanets alter their habitual motions and meteorites fall from the sky.Which brings us to the date of the great flood that brought the Younger Dryas toa close. In 2008 a team of Danish geologists conducting an extensive examinationof ice cores in Greenland were startled by a thick layer of soot in the icewhich pointed to a cataclysmic world event. “The climate shift was so suddenthat it is as if a button was pressed,” they remarked. The samples yielded adate of 9703 BC.35What is fascinating about these traditions is how they all feature unusualpeople coming out of nowhere to forewarn specific humans of impending globaldoom and afterwards assist them with the rebuilding process.Who were those people?"},{"pageContent":"> 3. THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE GODSEven as a child I had an irrational yearning to visit New Zealand, possiblybecause it lay on the opposite side of the world to where I was born and wastherefore mysterious and unattainable, or because some latent generic impulsemotivated me. During my early teens I also developed a passion for volcanologybut never followed it as a career because I couldn't figure out how the study oferupting magma could possibly lead to dating girls, at least the type whointerested me. This was, after all, the early 1970s and it would be anotherthree decades before geeks became fashionable.But patience has its reward. The opportunity to travel to that faraway landfinally presented itself in 2005 after I became a best-selling author, and thisnewly found status afforded a four-week tour. I found New Zealand — Aotearoa inthe native tongue — to be a natural paradise. Ironically if one were to insert along needle into the Earth at my place of birth it would re-emerge at Aotearoa’sNorth Island and beside the sacred mountain Taranaki, a majestic volcano bearinga passing resemblance to Fuji-yama. This is how the gods get their kicks withmortals. Naturally I climbed the magnificent cone and I have been smitten withthe landscape ever since.I was also in New Zealand to conduct research. I took an interest in the historyof its earliest settlers, little of which is known to most Kiwis let alone theoutside world — myself included, until I was presented with a book by one of myhosts.What little is known about pre-European settlement in New Zealand comes to usvia the Maori who sailed to its shores some time around the twelth century aftermigrating from Polynesia. Upon arrival they displaced people already living onthe North Island,1 among them the peaceful Waitaha who inevitably retreated tothe even more isolated South Island, where their numbers dwindled to what theyare today, an estimated 10,000. I couldn’t help but draw a comparison with theHopi — similarly peaceful, similarly displaced by migrating foreigners, andwhose numbers nowadays barely scrape beyond 13,000. Both cultures possessfolklores describing events before, during and after the flood.In the early 1990s a local historian by the name of Barry Brailsford wasapproached by the reclusive Waitaha elders and given permission to publish theiroral traditions, finally setting the record straight concerning the trueprehistory of New Zealand and, much like the recently-published Hopi prophesies,to warn humanity of the consequences of living out of harmony with the land andsky. Predictably, like other independent scholars presenting facts that overturnhistories written by the victorious and promoted by the complacent, Brailsfordendured praise and hate in equal proportion.There are complex politics at play here: by highlighting the Maori asnon-indigenous to New Zealand risks, in the eyes of their recent tribal council,losing favourable treaty rights awarded by the British after they, ironically,displaced the Maori; not to mention Maori indigenous rights at the UnitedNations. Also at stake is the unquestionable matter of pride. And yet it is amatter of record in Maori history that its early migrants found people alreadysettled in New Zealand.2 Maori elders of previous generations acknowledge theexistence of Kiri-puwheru (red-skinned Stonebuilders) prior to their arrival.Traditions describe giants living on the North Island, one being a celebratedhero by the name Kiharoa who lived in Tokanui Pa, still referred to this day asa giant’s grave. A giant by the name of Matau lived on a hill above the WairakaRiver and by all accounts stood eleven feet tall.3 The discovery in 1875 ofanother giant buried seven feet below the sand on a spit in Timaru led onereporter to reopen the investigation in 1999.4 And no wonder, the individual wasreportedly twenty-four feet tall and belonged to a local tribe of giants calledTe Kahui Tipua, who were still in existence in the eighteenth century. Hundredsof their remains have been unearthed, all have mysteriously vanished — alongwith said reporter’s job after he contacted a local resident who’d kept one hugelower jaw as both evidence and souvenir.5A similar fate befell the remains of giants found in caves along the curvingneck of New Zealand's northwestern shore, specifically at Port Waikato andRaglan. Residents there have been reporting finds since at least the 1920s, andeach time, the bones were taken away by authorities and never heard of again.Except in one case where diggers came across a giant skeleton and wereinstructed to blow it up. Dumbfounded by such a drastic measure, they saved thejawbone and gave it to the museum in Kao Kao.6 In a similar situation nearRaglan, in the vicinity of Mount Karioi (literally Mountain of the Red-hairedGiants), a human skull the size of a large pumpkin was unearthed during roadworks. The find was removed and never heard of since. Meanwhile a nearby cavethat yielded dozens of giant skeletons, some with red hair still attached, wasordered dynamited, the bones handed to the Maori council and reportedly groundto dust.7As if the prehistory of New Zealand couldn't get any more peculiar, a number ofarchaeological accounts validate a human presence far earlier than historiansare prepared to accept, resulting in official paperwork going missing, booksexpunged from libraries, even public documents declared classified and madeinaccessible to the public for seventy-five years. And no wonder: in 1874workers fitting a sewer in Auckland dug fourteen feet down through layers ofclay, sand and two lava flows before finding a charred stump of a large manukatree, alongside which lay an adse, a type of ancient axe. The engineer who madedrawings of the find noted how the remaining branches showed clear signs ofchopping by the stone implement. The veracity of the report was acknowledged bythe Inspector of Surveys. After dating the various sedimentary layers it wasconcluded that a person had been busy chopping a tree on this hill around 30,000BC.8[images/00009.jpg]Tree chopped some 30,000 years before the Maori arrived in New Zealand.Research carried out by a UK forensic pathologist on skeletal remains fromformer Waitaha sites in the region at the request of Noel Hilliam, late curatorof the Dargaville Museum, traced their DNA to Wales c.2500 BC.9 As with the adseand the tree stump, the results were explosive, and explains why Hilliamrequested the tests be conducted in secret from the New Zealand government andthe cabal of academics who have carried out a relentless whitewash of thecountry's pre-Maori history, including the discrediting of anyone whose evidencecontradicts their sanitized view of events.Speaking with independent ancient history researchers in New Zealand, I was toldthe topic wasn't always so controversial. A couple of decades ago it was stillpossible to speak freely with Maori elders concerning the prehistoric peoples ofAotearoa. The subject was hardly taboo. Nowadays such talk is met with denialand derision by a younger tribal council, as David Rankin, chief of the NgapuhiMaori tribe illustrates: “Maori are not the indigenous people of Aotearoa. Therewere many other races already living here long before Kupe [first Maori leader]arrived. I am his direct descendant and I know from our oral history passed down44 generations. I believe this needs to be investigated further because everyMaori community talks about Waitaha, Turehu and Patupaiarehe. This goeshand-in-hand with the other research… In 2002 I went to the Austronesian LeadersConference in Taiwan and we discussed similarities with Taiwanese Aborigines. Wetraced our origins and the Maori and Polynesian connection to China. All theleaders such as myself and Matiu Rei, Aborigines, Solomon islanders, Rapa Nuiand Hawaiians were all interested in early settlement theories. There is a lotof writing about the whole ancestral link.”10And to quote Rankin again: \"Who were these red-headed, fair-skinned people whogreeted our wakas [canoes]? You can't deny your oral history. If we try to asMaori we're actually denying our history.\"11So Hilliam had cause to act without consultation, and in the end was vindicatedby the DNA results. A similar independent study by immunologist Jean Dausset onthe genetic origins of Easter islanders also found their DNA a close match toWelsh people, along with that of Native Americans, and the Basques of northernSpain, a people with a mysterious origin of their own.12The Welsh connection brings up an interesting observation regarding thebeautiful art of Maori tattooing, whose spiral patterns some Maori artists claimare not indigenous to their Polynesian homelands at all, but developed onlyafter migrating to New Zealand. For this to have occurred, the early tatooistsmust have been exposed to another culture already practicing such art, one thatis clearly and unequivocally Celtic. Additionally, dual spirals have beendiscovered cut in relief on rocks in and around the Oahi Caves southeast ofMount Taranaki, and they bear more resemblance to those carved at Tiwanaku thanto any known Maori art. As the historian W.J. Phillipps observed, “only on theSouth American continent is there found an ordered series of spirals which canbe compared with those of the Maori.”13 The style of these spirals is alsocommon to the temple of Tarxien in Malta, so the question is, since the olderMaori never worked with stone, who exactly carved the petroglyphs?That’s the back-story.[images/00010.jpg]Maori never worked with stone, so who carved these spirals (top) and why arethey identical to those in Tiwanaku and Malta?THE LONG MEMORY OF THE WAITAHAWhat excited me most about the hitherto undiscussed Waitaha is how they retainthe memory of events pre-dating the great flood. Their history begins on theworld’s most isolated island Waitangi Ki Roto (Island of the Weeping Waters), oras it was named by European seafarers who only found it in the late 18thcentury, Easter Island.The ancestors of the Waitaha are said to have “walked with the gods and touchedthe distant stars.”14 These people appear to have been composed of severalgroups with specific functions. There were Kiritea (Stone People) who came fromAsian lands. And then there were Urukehu (Starwalkers), people skilled inreading the geometry of the stars and navigating the oceans who would eventuallyinstruct people in the Pacific how to locate Aotearoa. The Urukehu’slight-colored hair and skin set them apart from Polynesian people. The historianMākereti Papakura believed this light-skinned strain dates back to theirtraditional place of origin, Havai’iki, although the word literally means'homeland' and does not refer to a place; certainly it is not related toHawaii.15Every year on Easter Island the Waitaha welcomed \"the appearance of the waka ofthe gods,\" the massive double-hull canoe of the Urukehu, and with each encounteranother layer of wisdom was added to the kete (basket) of knowledge held by theWaitaha's wisdom keepers. But one year the canoe failed to return when \"angrystars gathered close to the Moon to give birth to the Tides of Chaos, thedreaded Deluge. And a terrible tragedy unfolded before them. Far beyond theveiled horizon, seas began to climb to terrible heights before rolling out toattack all in their path. Dark storm winds shredded the clouds, swept birds fromthe sky, sucked fish out of water and smashed them into the sail. Cold handsstruggled to lower it before the waka capsized... Huge waves crashed over thewashboards, fierce winds bent the tall mast, and the hull... was forced beneaththe waves. It survived but wallowed deep within. Then the winds gained newstrength from the gathered stars to push the waka relentlessly across the wildwaters.\"16The story describes how the commander of the waka, watching half his canoecrippled and breached, made the sensible decision to cut loose the bindings ofthe two hulls and allow one to avoid capsizing.[images/00011.jpg]Could the formidable Tongan double hull canoe be a legacy of the wakas once usedby the Urukehu 11,000 years ago?Thirteen days passed. The waka was driven further and further south, pushed byfierce winds until it finally reached the shores of an island to which was giventhe name of the surviving canoe, Aotea Roa, the traditional name of NewZealand’s South Island but today applied to the nation as a whole.The Waitaha narrative picks up some time after the world was “turned by water,”when the children of the gods appear. Sailing from a land in the east andfollowing the star Sirius, a man named Kiwa arrives on Easter Island. From thisbase he makes numerous voyages across the Pacific, charting its remaining lands,many of which had become islands following the catastrophic rise in sea level.As the Waitaha accurately recall, some of those islands are no more.17At this point in the narrative a second hero survivor appears, a female leaderfrom the west by the name of Hotu Matu’a, commander of a fleet of double hulledwakas to whose captains she instructs, “go forth and find the Sacred BirthingCord of the World,”18 the nickname by which Easter Island was known, and fromwhich derives its oldest name Te Pito O Te Henua (Navel of the World). That'squite the panegyric for such a small dot in the middle of the Pacific, themeeting point of two ancient currents stretching horizontally across this ocean,suggesting Easter Island once served as a kind of focal point.Like Kiwa, Hotu Matu’a was an accomplished seafarer, and for her mapping of manyislands she became known as the Net of the World. She was described as tall anddark with black hair and brown eyes. Kiwa, on the other hand, couldn’t be moredifferent: fair skinned, blue eyed, golden or red haired, features defining himas a genetic link to the Urukehu gods. In time the two heroes are wed and theirten children follow in their footsteps, mapping more of the restructured PacificOcean, but primarily visiting Aotea Roa, and returning to Easter Island onmultiple occasions.But it is their grandson Mãui who is of importance to our quest. During hisformative years Mãui was schooled by his grandmothers, memorizing the oraltraditions dating from a time \"long ago when the stars shone in a different skyand a different pattern,”19 an indication of the remote period from which thetribe's knowledge is drawn and remembered. Mãui was taught to respect the sevengods, each representing an aspect of nature. He learned about the two greatoceans that made up the world, how to navigate the great currents, and the starsthat guide seafarers across vast and truculent seas. Not surprisingly thisinstilled in the young lad a respect for the wisdom handed down from theantediluvian gods, so much so that he hoped one day to navigate the dangerouscurrents of the central Pacific himself and locate a distant land said to beprotected by the old tides: the Birthplace of the Gods.The opportunity presented itself soon enough. Sailing his great waka westwardsalong the north current, Mãui and his crew survive mountainous seas, connectwith the southern current and arrive at the mist-covered North Island of NewZealand. After stocking up with provisions, the crew set sail down the eastcoast and the short hop to Aotea Roa. Mãui must have had foreknowledge of theexact location of “where the gods first drew breath” because he searches forspecific features along the coast — a considerable feat given 1200 nauticalmiles of coastline to choose from — before the waka finally beaches at a wideestuary opposite a place called the Mast of Aotea Roa, today known as the erodedvolcanic peninsula of Onawe, to the east of the present city of Christchurch.Mãui then instructs his most able runners to mark a trail leading to a specificlocation deep in the mountainous center of the island. For two days and nightsthe runners follow the winding, snow-fed waters of the Waimakariri River,returning to describe the magic of the land and waters they found. Emboldened,Mãui assembles a party of twelve men and twelve women to walk the river to thePukenga hills, crossing majestic tussock grasslands, beech forests and amountain pass before finding themselves in an alpine basin of great mystery andpower. “He stood in awe of a wairua [spirit] that filled the air with forcesthat stretched his being to another plane. His triumphant karakia [prayer]echoed strongly from the soaring towers of stone that marked forever the BirthPlace of the Gods.”20Song of the Waitaha — the collective name of the oral traditions — is highlydescriptive of Mãui’s exuberance as he stood in this, the Crucible of the World.It is clear the sacred site induced in the ancient navigator a reaction that wasnothing short of spiritual, and having experienced the site myself on fiveoccasions I can attest to the accuracy of what this adventurer must have felt.Kura Tawhiti, as the main site is called — Castle Hill in anglicised form — isboth breathtaking and exhilarating, it is proof that when a sacred place remainscontinuously unadulterated by human folly its power is palpable to even the mostcynical visitor. Even now it is difficult to find the superlatives to describethe feel of this place. I, for one, empathise with how Mãui must have felt whengazing upon the Birthplace of the Gods for the first time — as did anotherpilgrim who journeyed to the site in 2002, the Dalai Lama, who described it asone of the great spiritual centers of the universe.[images/00012.jpg]The Sacred Nest, as seen from Kura Tawhiti.The natural alpine basin in which Kura Tawhiti stands was once part of a shallowseabed, since thrust three thousand feet closer to the stars, leaving thelimestone exposed to the elements to create two groups of freestandingmegaliths. The first resembles a labyrinth of curiously shaped stones that seemsomehow animated, while the second stands individually apart along the backboneof a nearby ridge, in a certain light resembling the outstretched fingertips ofa buried giant.Two adjacent sites complete the Birthplace of the Gods: Flock Hill, and PrebbleHill, which the Waitaha refer to as the Sacred Nest, undoubtedly the focalpoint, a place that keeps its mysteries very close to its chest. Visually it isan awesome lunar-shaped escarpment, similarly composed of scores of limestonemonoliths, its concave basin appearing as though molded by the curved undersideof a massive spaceship. Around the time of the Younger Dryas it would have beensurrounded by deep, turquoise waters fed by nearby glaciers, making the SacredNest resemble an island in a primordial lake.Kura Tawhiti translates as ‘School Distant’, it is a vast outdoor academy whosestones are said to contain the wisdom and cosmology of the Urukehu gods and,later, the Waitaha who followed in their footsteps. Each monolith — whethernatural or deliberately placed — was selected to impart a specific teaching ofthe Mysteries to visiting initiates, in the same tradition as the stone circlesof western Europe. The metaphor behind ‘distant school’ refers to how theknowledge placed here not only came originally from the stars, but its combinedand applied wisdom serves to reconnect the initiate with those distant points oflight — a relationship any ancient Egyptian or Chaldean would find familiar; itssecondary meaning accurately describes its reclusive location on the globe. Theancients always worked with multiple layers of interpretation in every name orsymbol.The reward for hiking the long trail to the summit of Kura Tawhiti is anenigmatic fifty-foot tall monolith named for the tutelary goddess of the site,Marotini. The combined forces of thousands of years of veneration, plus theaction of water percolating through the limestone bedrock — the bi-product ofwhich is the creation of a natural electrical charge — produces an immediate andpalpable energy of place. This point of high wisdom, literally andmetaphorically, may also have once been a place of shamanic travel, a portalthat by its very geology alone connects one to the stars.Long before I'd read the traditions of this landscape temple, as transmitted bythe Waitaha, I experienced its power first-hand, hearing the voices of theancestors that later became a framework for this book. As is the case at mostsacred sites, information is revealed layer by layer, visit upon visit, theunderstanding building like a play in many acts. On one occasion I had a chanceto meditate beside the Marotini stone, which even to the casual observerresembles the eroded face of a kind of lioness. The stone was trying to confirmsomething that had occupied my mind during the uphill trek: how the erodedmonoliths, even the tall outcrops forming the labyrinth in the lower section,seemed to portray faces and forms deliberately carved into the limestone butlong since eroded. Of course the average geologist would explain — and correctly— how the action of rain and weather over time on exposed rock does give theimpression of features familiar to the eye — faces of people, animals and soforth, a phenomenon known as simulacra, particularly common in waterborne rocksuch as sandstone and limestone. And yet I found this valid scientificexplanation wanting. There was something different about these stones, theyreally did appear to be a picture gallery of faint faces worn by thousands ofrainy seasons.It was much later, sitting in the comfort of the main library in Wellington, thecapital, when I finally spent quality time pouring over the Waitaha narrative.Much to my amazement it contains references to the creation of monuments at TeKohanga, the collective title for the Birthplace of the Gods, of which KuraTawhiti is but one component. The story goes back to the days following theDeluge — after the gods stopped visiting Easter Island, but before the time ofthe great navigator Mãui — when a group of people called Tu Mata Kokiri (Keepersof Stone) appear from the west Pacific. Nothing else is mentioned until severalgenerations after the Deluge, when the Waitaha on Easter Island welcome anothercanoe, whose passengers are described as pale-skinned with hazel eyes and red orfair hair, not dissimilar to some inhabitants already living on the island bythen, but with a difference: the visitors arriving from somewhere to thenorthwest, from a land even by then lost to memory, are described as having eyeswith a half-closed appearance. These voyagers are referred to as kanohi karapa,and since they carried knowledge of “shaping stone without breaking its spirit“they were named Tu Takap (Stone People).21 The Waitaha recorded their storythus: “We are and we are born to stone... hidden in the hugeness of stone builtso tall, other eyes failed to see our monuments... Huge are the sacred monumentswe carved at Te Kohanga.”22I had my answer. The faces in the stones hadn't been a figment of imagination.The monoliths had been shaped using “hammer stones\" by the Tu Takap, who alsocarved the image of Marotini and other figures related to ancient mythology: “Atowering column of the purest stone was shaped to place Marotini in the land...we asked so much of the Stone Shapers when they carved her to stand against thestars. Tall timbers and thick ropes lifted them high above the land to carveMarotini. Ever higher they climbed to cut away the curving charcoal lines toreveal the beauty of our tupuna [ancestor]. And when the last blow was struck,and the inner stone stood true, we made kumara [sweet potato] to place at herfeet.\"23Interestingly, the related word tunupa (mill-bearer) is the Andean nickname forthe Creator God Pachacamac, upon whose shoulders the mill of the heavens churns.His effigy is carved onto the vertical mountainside overlooking the temple cityof Ollantaytambo.[images/00013.jpg]The image of Marotini, tutelary goddess of Kura Tawhiti, once shaped by humanhands. It gazes over the Birthplace of the Gods. a site that is potentially16,000 years old. New ZealandIt wasn’t just heroes who were commemorated in stone at the Birthplace of theGods. As I mentioned earlier, this was a great seat of learning, an ancientacademy. The Waitaha narrative implies that the Urukehu with whom they’dinteracted were great navigators as well as astronomers. In one account it isstated how these Starwalkers went to Kura Tawhiti to record the movement of thestars on a monolith called the rock of ages. I’ve climbed to the site on fiveseparate occasions but have yet to locate this calendar stone, hardly surprisinggiven the thousands of years of weathering, it may no longer be obvious to theeye, however, another quote clearly states there were other monoliths used forthe same purpose: “Many were the wondrous shapes worked in the stone of TeKohanga, and none was more sacred than the Tai Atea, the stone set in place tohold the central star of Matua Tonga [Southern Cross].”24A 16,000-YEAR OLD CALENDAR STONE?In 2018 I switched my attention to Flock Hill, the third site, because so littleof it has been explored. Like Kura Tawhiti it features the same type oflimestone monoliths, lots of them, and from its escarpment one is treated to adramatic side view of the Sacred Nest. Not a whisper could be heard on the hillor the entire plain below, a total absence of sound. A falcon landed on anunusual monolith nearby, whose top appeared to have been artificially shapedinto a large, flattened disc. Taking this as a beckoning call, I wandered over.A raised relief stood on the surface of the disc, much like a sundial. Unlike asundial, the relief was two-thirds along the diameter of the disc, enabling anobserver on the ground to line up the relief with the top of the disc.Since the disc was also inclined at approximately 30º it was possible to look atthe relief face-on and make out what appeared to be an elongated face; I shiftedmy position to observe it from the side and the effect was still obvious.Whether or not it was just a trick of the light, of greater importance is thatthe relief had a long axis, thus it could be used to reference an object in thesky. If this stone was the one used to mark the Southern Cross, a few daysplaying with a program called Stellarium would reveal if ever the two lined up.[images/00014.jpg]Flock Hill calendar stone, with Kura Tawhiti and Marotini in the distance.The problem was, where to start? The two most important calendar events used byancient people were the spring equinox and the winter solstice, so I decided towork with these around 8000 BC, well after the great flood. Nothing. TheSouthern Cross was way off the mark by then. 11,000 BC, still nothing. Butaround 14,000 BC the constellation began to rise in alignment with the relief,yet still below the mountain range in the background. Then on the spring equinoxc.14,800 BC, magic. An observer would have seen the Southern Cross rising abovethe disc for the first time, carried along a vertically inclined Milky Way asthough the celestial river was oozing from the monolith itself. The effect musthave seemed dramatic.The exact same alignment repeated on the winter solstice.But was this what the Urukehu had had in mind? Another pivotal constellation intheir world — and later the Waitaha’s — was Orion, so I took the opportunity toexamine its relationship with the calendar stone. In 14,800 BC Orion was 17º offthe mark, but around 12,400 BC its belt stars could finally be seen rising abovethe disc on the winter solstice. As the program rolled forward in time to 10,400BC, Orion’s belt remained aligned above the disc but now with most of theconstellation above the horizon. As we shall see later, this date has enormousimplications in our quest.I walked around the Flock Hill calendar stone and found an adjacent monolithwith a convenient alcove to sit on and write down my observations.When I got up and looked back at the stone, I was amazed to find it too hadevery appearance of having been carved by human hands. The oval alcove resembledan upright bowl into which the light of an object is meant to shine; above thealcove, and slightly offset from its axis, the stone has been shaped into twohorns, as though carved to mark the trajectory of an object in the sky. Turningto Stellarium, the only object that aligns with the narrow gap between the hornsis the rising winter solstice Sun c.10,400 BC; the other is the Moon, whoseMinor Standstill is precisely marked by the stone’s alcove; just like the stone,both objects’ trajectories are slightly offset to each other.It was turning out to be a very productive day. I returned to take a fresh lookat the calendar stone. From the rear it resembles a boat, in fact the southernend of the entire monolith looked as thought it wass been carved like afigurehead at the bow of an old ship. Again, this could all be simulacra, andyet the head is precisely aligned to the south celestial pole. I positionedmyself behind it. The head was clearly looking through the gap between two largeboulders and right across the valley to another gap in the mountains. Anobserver sitting in the same position on the winter solstice in 10,400 BC wouldhave seen Sirius, a major navigational star throughout the Pacific, rising intothis natural cup.[images/00015.jpg]Sun and Moon positions in relation to the alcove stone c.10,400 BC (front ofstone shown for clarity).[images/00016.jpg]Southern Cross as observed above calendar stone c.14,800 BC.[images/00017.jpg]Orion’s Belt above calendar stone c.12,400 BC, and the full constellationc.10,400 BC.[images/00018.jpg]I returned to Kura Tawhiti (another two hours of climbing) to see if anotheralignment presented itself. Its most obvious landmark is the Marotini stone onthe summit. Due to long-term erosion, the monolith’s axis is not absolute, butit does point to a prominent curve between two peaks on the opposite mountainrange, a convenient bowl. The spread of 90-98º means we could be looking atanything in the eastern sky along this arc. Using 10,400 BC as a marker, theonly object of note that rises out of this bowl is the Southern Cross onceagain, on the spring equinox.It appears there are two potential dates being commemorated at the Birthplace ofthe Gods, with the location and its monuments carefully selected to takeadvantage of the background of mountains that the Urukehu would have used toframe the sky and reference significant stellar objects and dates.[images/00019.jpg]Marotini (shown face-on for clarity), would have looked at the Southern Crossrising into a natural hollow between two peaks across the valley on the springequinox c.10,400 BC.The same technique was employed on the other side of the Pacific, at a sitestrategically founded by another group of flood gods at another kind ofbirthplace, Cuzco Cara Urumi (Uncovered Navel Stone). Seen from its originalQorikancha temple, the passage of the Milky Way establishes an intercardinalhorizon against the foreground of mountains, creating a cosmic axis as it arcsthrough the night sky. This was recreated and marked on the ground using huacas(sacred sites). As any ancient seafarer knows, by understanding the position ofthe stars it is possible to predict the behavior of the oceans, even when doingso a hundred miles inland, making long sea voyages possible and assuring thesafe passage of ships.DISTANT EVENTS ETCHED IN MEMORYDespite living on a near-paradisal land, life wasn’t all wine and roses for theWaitaha. Like many people whose existence covers great spans of time, they toorecord disasters that have befallen the Earth over the course of 11,000 yearsbesides the great flood. One account describes how stars fell, “long showers offlame rained down, fiery darts falling out of the sky, a fiery waka descendingout of the sky... burning rocks crashed to earth. And a frightful humming washeard. And a great burning ball plunged down.” Everything burned, a massive firedestroyed much of the eastern side of the South Island, followed by a change inclimate. First came floods and heavy winds, then droughts that sparked morefires. No date is set for the event, but given the story’s place in thenarrative it seems to coincide with a comet and mass coronal ejections in 3150BC and 2345 BC,25 both events causing havoc on a global scale, the latterrecorded by Chinese astronomers.Another fire of unknown origin c.1200 BC — quite likely another mass coronalejection — destroyed practically every urban civilization in the easternMediterranean between Anatolia and Palestine and brought about the suddencollapse of the Bronze Age. The terror of “the Star Fires” — the Waitaha termdescribing meteoric or solar induced events — forced people to seek protectionin deep caves, much in the same way they’d done on Easter Island under similarcircumstances.26Another dramatic event imprinted in Waitaha memory is the creation of LakeTaupo, which covers a substantial portion of the North Island. According tomainstream geologists the lake is a caldera formed by the eruption of asupervolcano c.24,500 BC whose magnitude ranks as one of the greatest eruptionsof all time. It is suggested that the debris ejected into the atmosphere mayhave been responsible for starting the Great Ice Age. However, the Waitaha begto differ and, like their aboriginal neighbours in Australia who recall eventsproven to have taken place deep in prehistoric times,27 they too have eyewitnessaccounts to tell. According to the Waitaha, “Tohunga [wisdom keepers] holdwithin their kete [basket] a most sacred karakia [prayer] that travels the skytrails in the dawn. Its words reach out to the thirty-six houses in the heavensto awaken Auahi Tu Roa [Firebird] who carries messages across the darkened skiesfor the Sky Father. If the mana [spiritual integrity or magic] of the Tohunga isgreat enough he frees that shooting star to fly just as the last starsdisappear.” Unfortunately the wisdom keeper got the prayer wrong on thisoccasion, allowing the passing comet to break away from its typical trajectoryand crash to Earth. The impact was so strong it reversed the Earth’s rotation:“the days went backwards and the night became the day, and the day became thenight.” Fire engulfed the land. Survivors hid in caves before rains finallyquelled the flames and the earthquakes stopped. Re-emerging, the peoplepredictably found a land completely altered, with Lake Taupo created when partof this \"Earth Shaker\" crashed. \"It did not fly from a volcano to crash to Earthbut came out of the heavens along the track of the Moon and Sun,\" they said,causing \"fires that fell from the skies.\" Hence why the name originally given tothe lake was Tauponui Atea, which roughly translates as ‘big lake created fromspace’.28THE THREAD TO SOUTH AMERICALet’s now rejoin the narrative after Mãui reached Kura Tawhiti.He continued his journey throughout the South Island, marking other power placesand connecting them to specific stars — the ancient practice ofastro-archaeology that underlies the design of virtually every ancient temple onEarth29 — and locating nearby islands that in time became part of New Zealand’smainland due to the ever shifting tectonic forces of this region.Finally, he asked a group of families to stay behind and establish a home beforesetting sail back to Easter Island. But before he could return, his wakavanished somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.30The importance of Waitaha history is two-fold: first, it marks, with absoluteprecision, the antediluvian Birthplace of the Gods, or at least one of them; andtwo, it depicts events before, during, and after the flood. The earliest pointof the narrative places the Urukehu sailing the Pacific as the flood is takingplace. If Mãui was their grandson, it stands to reason he and his crew werepresent in New Zealand within two generations, ostensibly around 9600 BC. Asecond time-frame is provided by the Waitaha grandmother elders in the secondnarrative Whispers of the Waitaha, in which they declare that the sacredteachings were carefully maintained, orally transmitted and applied for 10,000years until 1743 — about 25 years prior to Captain James Cook’s arrival in NewZealand — when the elders were instructed to hide the knowledge until moreappropriate times. If so, the compilation of teachings began about 1443 yearsafter flood.31This leaves a discrepancy of 1343 years between the flood and the arrival ofMãui, meaning that each generation of the Urukehu lived for seven hundred years!As absurd as it may seem, one characteristic of antediluvian gods in India,Mesopotamia and Egypt is their superhuman life span, as we shall see later.All this changes everything and what little we have known about the prehistoryof this part of the Pacific, and provides one point of origin for theantediluvian gods.But there’s one more aspect to be learned from the seafaring traditions of theWaitaha. They describe the manner in which the great ocean currents behavebetween New Zealand and Easter Island, and how the return journey requiredsailing past Easter Island to “a great land in the East before returning.”32There are two possibilities here: either there used to be a landmass beyondEaster Island, now submerged, or the \"great land\" referred to is South America.The Waitaha narrative provides a clue. When visiting this land it was customaryto take along a totem: “two birds, titi and kaka, went with them, and theirnames are joined in the most sacred waters of that distant homeland of theancestors.”33 Obviously this refers to Lake Titicaca, whose shore was once hometo a great civilization who built the temple cities of Puma Punku and Tiwanaku.Given how the megaliths marking Tiwanaku’s immense rectangular plaza align withstellar events along the horizon in 15,000 BC,34 the Waitaha of Aotearoainvariably give shape to a lost civilization in prehistoric times who sailedgreat distances as effortlessly as driving to the supermarket.How or why did three disparate points on the face of the Earth become sointrinsically linked? Part of the answer is mathematical: measure the distancefrom Tiwanaku to the Birthplace of the Gods via Easter Island, divide onesection into the other and Easter Island marks phi, nature's mathematicalproportion. The discrepancy is a mere 0.02, far too close to be merecoincidence.It appears that a remote outpost 12,000 feet up on the Bolivian altiplano mighthave been another home of the gods.[images/00020.jpg]The locations of the gods — Easter Island, Kura Tawhiti and Tiwanaku — arerelated to each other by phi.[images/00021.jpg]The ridge of Kura Tawhiti. Marotini is along the top, left of center."},{"pageContent":"> 4. BUILT BEFORE THE FLOOD\"Now, I don't believe an industrial civilization existed on Earth before our own— I don't think there was a dinosaur civilization... but the question of whatone would look like if it did is important. How do you know there hasn't beenone? The whole point of science is to ask a question and see where it leads.\"1The statement is by Adam Frank, astrophysicist at the University of Rochester inNew York who co-authored a paper with Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's GoddardInstitute for Space Studies, hypothesizing that advanced civilizations may haveonce populated the Earth.Their point is this: If complex life has existed on Earth for a period of 400million years and an industrial civilization has only occupied a mere 300 yearsof it, surely somewhere along such a vast expanse of time other industrialcivilizations might have flourished and fallen? In context of a 13.8billion-year old universe, it is feasible that even extraterrestrialcivilizations might have risen and expired.The problem is finding their traces. After a prolonged amount of time, artefactsof civilization are buried beneath rubble, dirt, volcanic ash, rising seas,creeping vegetation and encroaching urbanization. Even remnants of recentcivilizations such as the Roman are hard to find on the surface; statues andpottery and tools are often discovered by blind luck or abrupt erosion. And ifwe were to rely solely on fossil evidence, it ought to be remembered that only atiny fraction of fauna and flora become fossilized because the process requiresa number of geologic and atmospheric conditions. Since most physical remindersof planetary civilizations may be erased by now, Frank and Schmidt proposedlooking for subtle evidence of earlier industrial civilizations in sedimentaryanomalies and chemical balances in the geological record, something that wouldindicate an alteration of the Earth’s habitat through human intervention, suchas pollution. Certainly that’s one way to look at it.Another is to examine myth and folklore; and of course, to look at anomalousmegalithic structures, things that look entirely out of place relative to theirculture and level of sophistication, at least to our eyes. Curiously, theco-authors raised the possibility that the end of one civilization could sow theseeds for another, which brings up an anomaly that happened across the Eartharound 8000 BC, the period when humans suddenly and collectively discoveredagriculture, domestication of animals, astronomy, mathematics, and so on.An accident? A global impulse? Or did we inherit seeds sown by an earlier,advanced civilization whose roots were erased by cataclysm?THE ENIGMA OF TIWANAKUOne of the greatest anomalies lies hidden in plain view in the Andes.The Inka ruling class rose to prominence in the 15th century. Barely acentury-and-a-half later it was all but wiped out, conquered by a small band ofSpanish glory hounds that the Peruvians mistook for returning gods. In thisblink of a historical eye we are meant to believe the Inka took the art ofadvanced stone masonry to the highest levels of any civilization, living ordead, achieving it without knowledge of alloys and the specialist tools requiredfor complex stone cutting and shaping. And to make it easier for themselves,they allegedly built hundreds of megalithic citadels such as Saqsayhuaman,Tiwanaku, Puma Punku, Pisac, Cuzco and Machu Picchu while simultaneously dealingwith a civil war.[images/00022.jpg]Exquisite masonry robbed for a local home.Anyone who's traveled extensively through the Andes is dumbstruck by thestratospheric architectural mastery of Saqsayhuaman. Or the razorblade precisionof the Sun temple porphyry wall above the town of Ollantaytambo. Or the hightech H-blocks of Puma Punku, originally slotted together like Neolithic Lego.Surely projects of such magnitude, of such unique vision and endeavor, wouldhave been recorded and loudly proclaimed by their architects? Yet no claimexists. Inka literature mentions such places casually as though already familiarand accepted, because the truth is they were in existence long before the Inka.The compiler Pedro Cieza de Léon describes his encounter with the Aymara livingaround Lake Titicaca who, when asked about the Inka having built Tiwanaku,laughed at his question, asserting that everything seen in this temple complexwas built long before the Inka,2 assembled by magic in a single night when \"thestones came down of their own accord, or at the sound of a trumpet, from themountain quarries and took up their proper positions at the site.\"3[images/00023.jpg]Prehistoric Lego, anyone? Puma Punku’s H-blocks and a small selection of otherstones, as surveyed in the 1890s. More the work of a machine than man.[images/00024.jpg]Tiwanaku's temple complex covers 2000 acres, and the latest aerial surveillancelocates dozens of additional buildings still waiting excavation. Six knownrectangular enclosures border a stepped mound called Akapana, whose megalithshave been heavily looted over the centuries, first by the Spanish looking foraccessible building material for the capital La Paz, then by robber barons wholiterally robbed what remained to build the Bolivian railroads. The localsjoined in, helping themselves to the fine masonry scattered about the place tobuild the homes and streets of the little town of Tiwanaku itself; one adobehouse that once stood within the archaeological site employed large stone blockscarved with reliefs taken from the Akapana for a doorway. No doubt its humbleowner was inspired by the actions of the zealous local Spanish priest Pedro deCastillo who destroyed a noteworthy third site in the 17th century, from whichhe built a disproportionately huge church in the center of this otherwiseunremarkable town; his acolyte, the Andean chief Paxi-pati, behaved no better.Still, his actions helped me understand there once existed a relationshipbetween the Akapana, Puma Punku, and a third, lost temple now beneath thechurch, for the three sites form a perfect equilateral triangle. In the ancientworld it was standard practice to link sites sharing common functions usingperfect triangles.4 It is also well known that the Spanish followed an officialpolicy of building churches over pre-existing temples.[images/00025.jpg]The Tiwanaku triangle.Despite such travesties, enough masonry remained buried in 1904 for the Austrianarchaeologist and engineer Arthur Posnansky to dedicate forty-eight years of hislife to documenting Tiwanaku and its equally impressive satellite temple PumaPunku. He published five copious volumes detailing the impressive nature of thesite, its stupendous scale, and the means by which it met an ugly fate 11,000years ago.Posnansky was well aware that, like so many of its kind, Tiwanaku would havereferenced the position of objects in the sky during the epoch in which it wasbuilt. He used as his main subject the relatively well-preserved quadrangle ofstanding stones called Kalasasaya (the name means ‘standing stones’ in Aymara).In his day the stones were still mostly freestanding, with just a low boundarywall connecting them; ignorant but well-meaning latter-day restorers have filledthe spaces in-between with poorly fitted stones to form an enclosed courtyard.Posnansky reasoned that the monoliths mark celestial objects along the easternhorizon, when seen from an observation platform to the rear of the quadrangle.He took the corner megaliths to mark the position of the solstices, but thealignment missed the mark by 18 angular minutes.5 This is because the presentposition of the Earth relative to its celestial meridian has shifted over time,causing a relative shift in the marked position of the Sun.Celestial mechanics work like this: the Earth rotates with a kind of wobble atthe poles which completes a full cycle over the course of 25,920 years, aphenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, meaning that celestialobjects observed from the ground will be seen to shift in the sky, imperceptiblyso. While this is taking place the Earth's axis tilts about 4º over the courseof 21,600 years, an action called the obliquity of the ecliptic.[images/00026.jpg]Taking these two elements into account, Posnansky refined the date and got anexact match for the Kalasasaya. The row of megaliths referenced the solstices in15,000 BC. 6 In Posnansky's words: \"The calculations of the age of Tiwanaku arebased solely and exclusively on the difference in the obliquity of the eclipticof the period in which that great temple was built and that which it hastoday... the calculations were only possible by means of a building locatedexactly on the meridian and the length and width of which conformed to themaximum angle of solar declination between the two solstices.\"7His work was peer-reviewed for three years and the calculations were proven tobe sound. 8[images/00027.jpg]The Kalasasaya viewed from the Akapana Pyramid in 1890. Note thedisproportionate size of the church (top left) for such a small, remote village.[images/00028.jpg]The Kalasasaya buried in a deep sediment layer. Only possible through thousandsof years of pluvial climate and exposure to higher water levels from LakeTiticaca.The Kalasasaya's earliest known name, Oka-uru-ymata, given by the Puquina, meansMeasure-Day-Observed. It is a massive courtyard calendar measuring 421 feet longby 389 feet wide, almost twice the size of an average football field, and yetthe simple design belies its complexity — its length-to-width ratio of 1:1.08 isthe difference between solar and lunar calendars.[images/00029.jpg]When Lake Titicaca’s level was higher (white) its temples were connected alongthe shore.TIWANAKU AND THE FLOODPrior to 11,000 BC the agricultural conditions around Tiwanaku and the altiplanoof Bolivia in general were excellent. There is even evidence of introducedagricultural experiments, such as raised soil tables. But within 5,000 yearsTiwanaku was to face its biggest desecration, a disaster that marked the regionwith slow and irrecoverable decline. Tremendous seismic movements forced thewaters of Lake Titicaca to overflow. Other lakes to the north broke bulwarks,their waters emptying into Titicaca to form a wall of water that overwhelmedeverything and everyone in its rampage. Archaeological digs reveal a jumble ofhuman remains tangled with those of fish, pottery and utensils. Stones weremixed with jewels, tools and shells, and megaliths weighing hundreds of tonswere tossed around like matchsticks.One of the surviving artefacts is an impressive 440-ton monolithic block ofandesite carved into a doorway. Along the top, a set of beautiful reliefs depictthe Creator God Pachacamac holding two serpents, each representing thealternating electric and magnetic currents that give life to the universe. Thenineteen rays around his head cleverly reflect the Metonic Cycle, thecalibration of solar and lunar calendars every 18.6 years. Along the periphery,bird-like creatures depict, in stylized form, information relating to the cyclesof Venus, Sirius as well as eclipses. This calendrical masterpiece is the workof an inspired artist-astronomer, carved for posterity on one single, massiveblock of stone whose height and width also conform to the ratio between solarand lunar calendars.9But more revealing on this doorway are the forty-six reliefs of toxodons, a typeof rhino made extinct by the flood 11,000 years ago. Since the stone masonswould have borrowed from observation or memory, the doorway must have beencarved when the creatures were still roaming the altiplano, and still relevantto people of the period.[images/00030.jpg]Sun Door of the Kalasasaya and its complex astronomical detail.[images/00031.jpg]Posnansky adds the following remark on the condition of this calendar stone:\"The Door of the Sun which was found lying on its face on the ground, has beenpreserved in wonderful condition with all its inscriptions; but its back, andespecially the end exposed to the adverse atmospheric conditions, shows anenormous wearing away. It should be pointed out that the block from which thisnotable monument was carved is composed of andesitic hornblende, vitreous andvery hard lava, which, if polished as it was in that period, required severalthousands of years to wear away in the form in which we see it today.\"10 Byimplication it is likely that the quadrangle in which it was placed wasoriginally built before the flood.As I walked around the ramparts of Tiwanaku I appreciated Posnansky's passion tobring some sense of order to the site. His discoveries, together with meticulousmeasurements and reconstruction drawings by Alfons Stüdel and Friedrich Max Uhlein the 1890s, paint a vivid picture of a complex, well-designed city, completewith polished megalithic floors, and piers capable of accommodating thirtyocean-going vessels. This would have been when the water level of Lake Titicacawas up to one hundred feet higher and the edge of the temple city lay at itsshore.11 Tiwanaku was essentially one large man-made island. Indeed by followingthe contours of the lake before the flood one discovers how temples around itsperiphery, such as Amaru Muru, Cutimbo and Silustani, were once connected tothis massive inland sea and accessed by boat — not dissimilar to temples alongthe Nile.HIGH TECH AT PUMA PUNKUFor me, it is the haunting beauty of nearby Puma Punku and its jumble ofintricately carved andesite platforms and monoliths that captures theimagination. Its scattered, enigmatic H-blocks made from greenish lava, quarriedfifty-five miles north of Titicaca, resemble building blocks made for giants,designed to interlock and form impressive walls, sections of which still existedin the late 1800s. They possess the aura of an intricate computer schematic orengine room. The blocks appear identical, as though poured from a mold, yetclose inspection shows each one to have been individually made.The same applies to the mortise and tenon method with which large masonry blockshave been cut to slot perfectly into each other, a time-consuming enterpriserequiring the removal of large amounts of stone, although the result offersgreat structural integrity against earthquakes. The blocks were furtherstrengthened by I-grooves cut between adjoining slabs, a feature common tomegalithic sites throughout the Pacific, Cambodia and Sumeria; identical groovescan been at the temple of Kom Ombu in Egypt. It is claimed that copper waspoured into each I-groove to create a connecting strap between the stones.However, this ignores the fact that the resulting profile of the straps would beconcave, and yet examples recovered from the site show they are convex.Furthermore, poured copper would have molded itself to the imperfections in thestone, but the items in the local museum show they are not; rather, they wereindividually manufactured for the purpose. Copper is a soft metal, it would snapwhen the heavy stones shifted during an earthquake; using iron would have beenmore sensible, and it is abundant throughout the region. The only viableexplanation is that copper served as a conductor.What remains at Puma Punku gives an idea of what Tiwanaku would have looked likein its prime. One massive, recumbent stone resembles a kind of architrave,beautifully polished, without a hint of tooling, featuring parabolic curveswhich would tax any modern mason or machine. An identical stone exists at theSun temple at Ollantaytambo, and again among a field of stones still waiting tobe catalogued at Saqqara in Egypt! Either the stonemason responsible must havebeen present at all three sites, or three separate ancient architects performedthe same work, in the same era, using the same manual.[images/00032.jpg]H-blocks. Puma Punku.It has been noted how the blocks dispersed around Puma Punku feature tinydrilled holes, 0.15\" in diameter, into which were inserted gold nails to fastenlarge sheets of gold with bas reliefs of the stone carvings beneath. Some of thenails were till in existence in 1930 because the local boys in charge of themuseum found it impossible to remove them without damaging the stone.12While the Akapana and Kallassasya are essentially solar based, Puma Punku wasthe companion temple, a lunar site under the symbolic protection of the Puma, ananimal believed to represent the watery associations of the Moon. Just asKallassasaya had its Door of the Sun so Puma Punku had its lunar counterpart. Bythe time Posnansky managed to analyze it, all that remained of this \"mostsublime and significant monument of the Americans\" were fragments, albeitbeautifully crafted ones.13 This impressive monolithic door also deviated fromthe Door of the Sun in that the carvings were no longer of birds but of fish.Puma Punku's T-shape foundation incorporates an obscure mathematical ratio. Themound's proportion of 6:5 commemorates the Earth's precessional cycle of 25,920years divided by its axial tilt of 21,600 years. The ratio is unique to thisplanet, so to incorporate it in a building project implies the architectspossessed knowledge of obscure celestial mechanics observed over a vast periodof time, the implication being that whoever built Puma Punku must have beenaround for at least that long, or they inherited the information from an evenolder civilization. Either way we are dealing with a staggering span of time. Ifthis fails to impress, consider how the same ratio is created when taking thetwo fundamental building blocks behind all molecular structures, namely thesphere and tetrahedron. When the latter is placed inside the former, with thepoints of the tetrahedron touching the inner surface of the sphere, the ratio ofthe two surface areas is 6:5.14 This ratio also forms the earliest depiction ofthe ubiquitous Andean stepladder motif, the chakana or Andean cross, examples ofwhich still existed on site a decade ago before they were stolen.There is no doubt we are dealing with a technological and sophisticated culturein the high Andes that spanned every Dryas period, one that was clearly a cutabove standard Neanderthal education.THE MISALIGNMENT OF TIWANAKUBut there is a bigger riddle at Tiwanaku that has escaped attention. Ancientdesigners were masters of proportion and relationship. Countless examples aroundthe world atest to the work of a people obsessed with placing temples in perfectrelationship to each other and their natural surroundings, what later became theart of Feng Shui. And yet the Kalasasaya enclosure has been awkwardly insertedbeside the tallest structure of the complex, the Akapana mound, as though thetwo sites are linked yet herald from two different ages.Perhaps so. The Kalasasaya's alignment reflects its relationship to the meridianin 15,000 BC, as do the temples to the west and north. They form a unit. Howeverthe same is not true for the Akapana, nor a small enclosure immediately to thenorth called the semi-subterranean temple — nor Puma Punku half-a-mile to thesouthwest; these three are misaligned by 2º 50' to the rest of the site.15 Theynot only belong together, they belong to an even more remote period when theywere aligned to a very different sky.Is this possible? It is worth bearing in mind that the semi-subterranean templewas once a free-standing quadrangle of standing stones, since surrounded andburied by silt. It now stands some twelve feet below the level upon which thestanding stones of the adjacent Kalasasaya rest. It stands to reason that itmust far older than 15,000 BC, and by implication so must the Akapana and PumaPunku. Posnansky was of the same opinion when he noted how Tiwanaku shows signsof three distinct building periods. He too groups the three above temples intothe first period, noting how the Akapana itself belonged to a remote age and wassubsequently repaired and improved. In Posnansky's words: \"With regard to thefirst, or prehistoric, period of Tiwanaku, as we have decided to call it, thisis much more remote and we do not have, because of the present state of science,any basis for the establishing astronomical calculations; rather, we can onlyuse a geological basis for the determination of the period in which it wasbuilt.\"16[images/00033.jpg]The misalignment of Akapana and semi-subterranean temple relative to Kalasasaya;the same is true of Puma Punku[images/00034.jpg]The second period belongs to the Kalasasaya, which,he correctly maintained, was aligned to a different horizon, even showed signsof having been repaired after a catastrophic event hit the region. The thirdperiod is marked by refinements inside the Kalasasaya, such as an inner court,which again differs in orientation relative to its predecessor.[images/00035.jpg]Semi-subterranean temple, well below the level of the Kalasasaya behind it.[images/00036.jpg]Machined andesite at Puma Punku[images/00037.jpg]How its H-blocks might have fitted together.I have to agree with Posnasky's assessment because it plays out in other templesthroughout the Andes sharing the same mythology as Tiwanaku. I have made thejourney from Lake Titicaca to Cuzco on several occasions and each time is likewalking slow motion into a revealing riddle. If one pays attention to themasonry of the sites it quickly becomes obvious that Andean temples experiencedfour distinctive building periods. Using central Cuzco, Saqsayhuaman, Pisac andMachu Picchu as examples, even the casual observer will note how the topportions of buildings are made from the most inferior and smallest sized stones.They're also joined together with mortar, rendering every reconstructionpointless in the face of the devastating earthquakes that terrorize this region.This style represents both Spanish handiwork and recent attempts at restoration.Below comes Inka standard, where the stones are larger than colonial efforts,less mortar is used, and in some cases an attempt has been made to imitate theolder layer below, with the caveat that Inka stonework lacks the same precision,and tool marks are evident to the eye.Comparing the Inka layer to the third layer is like comparing a stagecoach to aBugatti. The stones are impractically large, fitted without mortar, the edgesare clean, sharp and precise, and the absence of tool marks makes them look asthough each stone was polished to perfection. Clearly there has been a hugetechnological leap forward, except we are traveling back in time. The Peruvianresearcher Alfredo Gamarra believes there were certainly three differentbuilding periods, which he classifies as Ukin Pacha, the Inka period of toolmarks and mortar and imprecision; Uran Pacha, a more technical and sophisticatedearlier craftsmanship; and Hanan Pacha, first world megaliths of natural stoneshaped as though softened through the application of an intense heat.18 It'sthis lower layer that is the most fascinating. Megaliths as tall as forty feetand weighing 500 tons, their faces curved like pillows, with edges no longerlinear but rounded and slightly recessed, as though a potter’s hand caressed alump of clay. They are also cut into individual shapes, with anywhere betweenfour to sixteen corners and as many angles per stone. No two are alike, and soprecisely fitted that even an alpaca hair cannot be inserted between them. Theyinterlock like an upright jigsaw puzzle, making them not only artistic wondersbut also earthquake proof.[images/00038.jpg]The megalithic layer (A) has been patched by less precise Inka work (B). Spanishand later work (C) gets sloppier and sloppier. Cuzco.And, it seems, instructional as well. In 2014 Dr. Derek Cunningham discoveredthat the way in which the Saqsayhuaman stones have been cut are not justfunctional and artistic, they deliberately encode information, because theirangular values correlate to known astronomical data. \"Each astronomical value(there are 9 standard values in total) was chosen by ancient astronomers to aidthe prediction of eclipses. These astronomical terms are a mixture of valuesastronomers use to measure time (the 27.32-day sidereal month) and values todetermine when the moon, earth and sun align at nodes. This includes the use ofthe 18.6-year nodal cycle of the moon, the 6.511 draconic month period betweeneclipse seasons, and also the 5.1-degree angle of inclination of the moon’sorbit. The remaining values typically are either half-values of various lunarterms, or values connected to the 11-day difference between the lunar and solaryears.\"18To demonstrate this he measured the lowest — and oldest — tier of stones anddiscovered the walls of Saqsayhuaman are, literally, a library in stone.[images/00039.jpg]Megalithic architects’ fastidiousness with detail; 3-inch keystone. Cuzco.HIGH HEAT AT SAQSAYHUAMANNow it gets really interesting. These stones are highdensity limestone bearingthe remains of small marine organisms and shells. However, something happenedbetween the time the blocks were removed from the quarry, and shaped and placedupright to form the walls of the citadel. An intense thermal effect was appliedthat left “no obvious fossils and organic remains... but only clearly visiblefine-grained structure.”19 The conclusion is that the blocks were subjected toan intense heating process of as much as 1500º Celsius that re-crystallized the“biogenic siliceous limestone into microcrystalline siliceous limestone. Innormal conditions this process is absolutely impossible.”20 Close observation ofthe stones shows they are also covered with a thin glassy glaze around thejoints, as though indeed subjected to intense heat. A similar example can beseen on the stone masonry along Cuzco's Loretto Street, site of the originalQorikancha temple.Who possessed the knowledge to work stone like this? The Inka knew nothing of itnor did they have memory of such unparalleled architectural achievements, letalone the understanding of moving enormous blocks of stone from one hill toanother. The chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega recounts in his Royal Commentariesof the Incas how one Inka king tried to emulate the efforts of the ancients byhaving a monolith brought to Ollantaytambo from the quarry several miles acrossthe valley, to help rebuild the temple: “This boulder was hauled across themountain by more than 20,000 Indians, going up and down very steep hills... At acertain spot, it fell from their hands and over a precipice killing more than3000 men.”21Twenty thousand men to shift a single stone? Given the amount of masonry used tobuild thousands of temples, who was left to tend to the fields, to fight a civilwar, to attend to lovemaking and procreation? The chroniclers of the periodoffer only shrugs: everything to be seen throughout the Andes had been madelong, long ago by magicians using some unknown force.22[images/00040.jpg]One of many large buttes carved with stairs leading nowhere, alcoves withastronomical functions, and upside down staircases depicting creation myths.The question is, who? Garcilaso recorded the traditions of the founding of Cuzcofollowing the great flood, a period when survivors fell into a lowly,uncivilized state, living without clothing in caves. A god then sent \"one of hissons and one of his daughters from heaven to earth\" to bring civilization to thepeople. Bearing a golden rod, this couple was instructed to plunge it into theearth at certain points along the Andes, and wherever the rod disappeared intothe soil they were to establish temple cities, one being Cuzco Cara Urumi, the‘uncovered navel stone'. 23This story is not unique to Andean gods, because it mirrors the actions of theZoroastrian flood hero Yim. The opening section of the Zend Avesta describesthis antediluvian figure as the first human and founder of civilization, who ispresented with a golden ring and knife by the god Ahura Mazda, which \"he pressedinto the earth and bore it with the poniard.\"24 For his services Yim wasforewarned of the flood and prepared accordingly. 25The Cuzco valley is unique for its huacas (sacred sites), hundreds of themfashioned into steps, seats, alcoves, and other various geometric shapes fromoutcrops of living stone. Their creators are known to the indigenous people asÑaupaq Machula (Wise Old Ones), gods from an era long ago. Many huacas exhibitsigns of considerable water erosion in a region that last experienced aprolonged wet climate over five thousand years ago. In some cases there aresigns that the worked stone has been marked by glaciers, a sign of profoundantiquity.26 This places Cuzco’s huacas close to the Younger Dryas era, not afar-fetched idea given that the giant mound of Huaca Prieta, on Peru's northerncoast, shows evidence of human involvement in 11,700 BC. 27Andean traditions refer to the megalithic monument builders by the nicknamehuari, a race of white-skinned, bearded, red-haired tall people led by a godnamed Viracocha, who appeared after the flood on a boat on Lake Titicacatogether with seven Hayhuaypanti — Shining Ones — one of whom was his wife andsister.Did these huari move the stones through the air and build megalithic sites tothe sound of a trumpet? Polynesian people might agree, because in their culturea oaro is actually a type of trumpet.[images/00041.jpg]The mechanical precision of second generation masonry. Qorikancha, Cuzco.HOME OF THE SHINING PEOPLEFrom these morsels of information we can now connect the events in the Andes tothe narrative so elegantly told by the Waitaha. If these Shining Ones werewhite-skinned and red-haired tall people, they are most likely the Urukehu godswho voyaged between New Zealand, Easter Island and South America, taking withthem the two totem birds, titi and caca. If so it explains why a group ofstrangers magically appear at Tiwanaku, on a remote altiplano 12,500 feet abovesea level. They had prior knowledge of its existence, they had been therebefore. If so, I feel confident in proposing the following scenario: the Urukehureturned to Lake Titicaca after the flood to assess the damage. They most likelyrebuilt Tiwanaku, just as Posnansky speculated. Certainly the site was alreadylong established and was geodetically important, as evidenced by its Aymaranickname taypikala (stone at the center). Like Kura Tawhiti, Easter Island andCuzco, Tiwanaku was a navel of the earth, a birthplace of gods.28 Its originalname tiwa naku comes from the Tongareva dialect of the Cook Islands and means MyPeople.29 Or more accurately, My Shining People, since the syllable aku isEgyptian for Shining Being. Tiwanaku was the home of the Shining Ones.We now have a potential link between the antediluvian gods of Easter Island,Polynesia, New Zealand, Egypt and the Andes.Once Tiwanaku was up and running again, this brotherhood set out to create othercult centers and promulgate the ideals of civilization throughout the Andes,exactly as local traditions recall,30 establishing and re-establishing templesstretching in a line from Lake Titicaca to Cuzco, as evidenced by the two oldestlayers of megalithic masonry mentioned earlier which, to many eyes, provideclear evidence of an antediluvian cultural project interrupted by a majorcatastrophe. Both styles of construction share obvious common elements yetdiffer drastically in terms of style, the oldest being fluid and organic, whilethe successive is sharp, linear and urbane, yet loses none of the craftsmanshipof the former. They are clearly linked and yet disconnected by a period of time.One piece of circumstantial evidence lies near the quarry used to buildOllantaytambo, where beautiful recumbent monoliths mark the path leading down tothe river plain and up to the temple itself. These massive works appear to havebeen abruptly dropped en route as though work was curtailed due to some other,more pressing matter. When you've just extracted and shaped a 300-ton rock,nothing could be more pressing than an impending meteorite and tsunami.So, what else can we find out about these ancient architects? One answer lies ina seemingly trivial detail: beards.[images/00042.jpg]A typical corner of Saqsayhuaman reveals the superlative craftsmanship incurving the stone. Obviously aesthetics were of great importance."},{"pageContent":"> 5. BEARDSMen cannot grow facial hair in the Andes. You need to travel across the Pacificto Asia, India and the Middle East to find such physiognomy. And yet my goodfriend and guide, Edgar, has a beard. But then he's Aymara, a very ancientpeople with mysterious roots, the pun on hair notwithstanding.I made this seemingly innocuous observation while driving through Puno, a cityon the shore of Lake Titicaca, and it led to a lively discussion about theremote origins of the people living around the lake's periphery, particularlythat most famous of local personalities, the god-man Viracocha, who “wore athick beard, whereas the Indians are clean shaven, and his robe came down to theground, while that of the Incas came only to their knees; this is why thePeruvian people called the Spanish 'Viracochas' the minute they saw them.”1 Onthe southern end of Lake Titicaca, an anthropomorphic pillar was found buried indeep silt inside the semi-subterranean temple at Tiwanaku, roughly at the levelwhere the lakeshore used to be 11,000 years ago. Carved from red volcanicscoria, it depicts the bearded Viracocha. It is not an isolated idol. Traditionsstate that one of the first acts performed by the Viracochas was the raising ofmany such effigies around the region. Some exist on the Mocachi peninsula facingTiwanaku to the north, an area of scattered megaliths as tall as 8 feet, markingan rectangle much like the Kalasasaya, and appear to belong the earlier Tiwanakubuilding period. One red statue representing a bearded Viracocha is surroundedby the snake symbol, just as it is at Tiwanaku. This will be of great importancelater.When Spanish missionaries arrived in Cuzco they found a similar statue stillstanding inside the Qorikancha, depicting a man looking remarkably like anitinerant monk, tall and lean and wearing a long robe and sandals, his pale facefully bearded — a Caucasian. No wonder Pizzaro and his band of barbarians weremistaken for the progeny of the gods, handing thirty conquistadores a majorpsychological advantage with which to subdue half a continent despite beingvastly outnumbered. It is not by accident that the same fate befell theCholulans of Mexico when they too mistook Cortez and his bearded pirates foranother returning, light-skinned, bearded god, Quetzalcoatl.[images/00043.jpg]A bearded and girdled Viracocha from the semi-subterranean temple at Tiwanaku,and right, in Mocachi, with recurring serpent symbolism.Edgar, who is also a shaman, impressed me with how the Aymara are themselves theprogeny of the Puquina, who fled to the Andes when the flood sank their home inthe Pacific, an island continent they call Lupakije, better known by itsnicknames Mu and Lemuria. No wonder they still talk openly about it as a matterof pride even though the event occurred 11,000 years ago; even a false door,carved on the face of a hill beside Lake Titicaca, bears the name Amaru Muru —Old Bearded Man of Mu.2 Legends of Viracocha's arrival in Tiwanaku and hiseventual departure across the Pacific were handed down from them.The Puquina's tradition neatly overlaps that of the Waitaha, whose predecessors,the Urukehu, frequently sailed between Tiwanaku, Easter Island and New Zealand,a nautical triangle covering over 14,000 miles. The adventurer Thor Heyerdahlproved such long distance travel across the Pacific was possible when he reachedFrench Polynesia from South America on his famous Kon-Tiki voyage of 1947;sixty-eight years later a second Kon-Tiki expedition reached Easter Islanditself. A text acquired by Heyerdahl on Easter Island mentions the existence ofan ancient land named Kainga Nuinui (Enormous Land) and how, after it sank inthe flood, Hotu Matu'a — one of the heroes of the Waitaha narrative — sent sevenscouts to Easter Island on a reconnaissance mission before bringing survivorswith her to the island.3EASTER ISLAND'S NAVELTwo thousand miles separate the temple cities of Tiwanaku, Pisac, Cuzco andMachu Picchu from the monuments of Easter Island, yet you'd think they belong tothe same culture. For one thing, the shared attributes of the Urukehu andViracocha's Shining Ones — light-skinned, red-haired and bearded — suggest theywere one and the same brotherhood. And for another, the locations associatedwith the flood gods are defined as navels of the earth.Over one hundred ahu (ceremonial platforms) are spread over the island. Theoldest — Ahu Tahiri, Ahu Mata and Ahu Vinapu — are also the best constructed. Ifone were to take the stones of Ahu Vinapu and replace them for those in Cuzco noone would notice the cunning swap, right down to tiny, three-inch keystones;another ahu by the name Hanaunakou contains impressively large megaliths thatappear to show carved faces, now heavily weathered due to their antiquity.4 Suchahu differ from newer platforms in that they are built from basalt, which is notfound on the island, so where did it come from? When marine explorer JacquesCousteau explored the island, he and his team came across rectangular cavitiesin basalt layers on ledges below sea level, thus the basalt must have beenextracted when the quarry was still accessible 12,000 years ago, prior to thedramatic rise in sea level, when Easter Island was considerably larger and partof an archipelago stretching several hundred miles.5 Folklore adds that when theisland was a substantial landmass, it was criss-crossed by roads so long that noone was able to determine where they began or ended, and indeed there are stilltraces of these tracks leading to the edge of the sea, into which theydisappear.6Whoever built the original ahu was most likely responsible for the sites in thehigh Andes, and not just because the methods of construction are identical, butfor the manner in which the stones were moved. The masons of Easter Island aresaid to have focused their mana (magical power)7 around a special sphericalstone called Te-Pito-Kura (the golden navel stone),8 enabling the stones to belifted and making them appear as though walking through the air to theirlocations during the course of a single night, much as they did at Tiwanaku andCuzco. The Swiss ethnologist Alfred Metreux made extensive studies of EasterIsland and wrote down oral traditions involving levitation: \"When EasterIslanders of today are asked about means by which the statues were transported,they only say: 'King Tiikoihu, the great magician, used to move them with thewords of his mouth... the idea of flying statues did not seem strange to thenatives... C.E. Fox reports such a concept from San Cristobal in the Solomons:\"Levitation is described as common both in the case of sacred stones and ofpriests, some of whom were levitated large distances through the air.\"'\" 9[images/00044.jpg]Ahu Vinapu, Easter Island. Identical to megalithic stonework in the Andes.Easter Island's flood myth features an antediluvian supernatural being calledUoke \"who traveled around the Pacific with a gigantic lever with which he priedup whole islands and tossed them into the sea where they vanished forever underthe waves. After thus destroying many islands he came at length to the coast ofTe-Pito-O-Te-Henua, then a much larger land that it is today. He began to leverup parts of it and cast them into the sea. Eventually he reached a place calledPuko Pihipuhi... in the vicinity of Hanga Hoonu [site of the navel stone]. Herethe rocks of the island were too sturdy for Uoke's lever, and it was brokenagainst them. He was unable to dispose of the last fragment, and this remainedas the island we know today.\"10 Uoke’s actions appear oddly similar to those ofthe Finnish god Ukko.The first survivors to reach Easter Island after the flood are said to have comefrom a massive Pacific island called Hiva which \"submerged under the sea\" due to\"the mischief of Uoke's lever.\"11 These were the 300 people picked up by HotuMatu'a and her Seven Sages, \"all initiated men,\" whose first task upon arrivingwas the construction of ahu.12 As to where Hiva might have been remains amystery. There are two islands in the Marquesas bearing the name Hiva Oa andNuku Hiva, although the names may be homage to the original homeland. They lieto the northwest of Easter Island and feature their own extensive collection ofahu, along with unusual goggle-eyed statues not dissimilar to those in EasterIsland and Tiwanaku. Before the flood, the Marquesas also had a substantiallylarger footprint and ostensibly formed one massive island.BEARDED MOAIBut back to beards. Easter Island's most celebrated inhabitants are made ofstone and stare longingly at the sky. At least the oldest do. Over a thousand ofthese moai (statue) dot the island, some erected on ahu, others along the slopesof Rano Raraku volcano, covered up to their necks in deep sediment. Excavationof one statue revealed the head to be attached to a long torso, making the moaijust over 40 feet tall.13The moai tend to be lumped together as a single event but they were definitelycarved by different people over different epochs following a similar recipe. Theyounger are shaped from the readily available volcanic tuft and tend to lack thefinesse and attention to aesthetic detail of the older moai, whose style andfacial features differ significantly, are carved from the tougher basalt, andare found at deeper stratigraphic levels, or beneath newer moai and their ahu;some have been recycled to shore up damaged structures.14Like the question of megalithic masonry in the Andes, the skill of the stonemasons on Easter Island began at an exceptionally high level and degraded overtime, the complete opposite of what civilization is supposed to induce. Thisbrings up an uncomfortable issue for historians who claim all the moai werecarved by Polynesians arriving up to 1500 years ago, who allegedly conductedthis labor-intensive symbolic project while conducting a civil war on a sixtysquare-mile speck of rock in the Pacific. The problem with this theory is, stonecannot be dated, only undisturbed organic matter found under it, and to date noone has bothered to conduct a thorough radiocarbon test to determine the age ofthe sediment upon which the statues stand, probably because thirty feet of soilcovering a moai is incompatible with a few centuries of erosion. Such a depth ismore likely the result of thousands of years of accumulation, an opinion sharedby the noted Harvard geologist Robert Schoch.15 Expectations were raised earlyin 2018 when UCLA archaeologist Jo Anne Van Tilburg and assistants dug to thebase of another moai and were finally in a position to secure organic material.I was in communication with her at this time and was told that by November ofthat year we should see a paper published with the results. November came andwent, no paper emerged, and upon expressing my surprise, her response was that“several papers will be published… none of them carbon date the moai but presentassociated dates.”16Sensing a whitewash-in-the-making, I turned to the Waitaha narrative — whichcovers at least 10,000 years of oral history 17 — to enlighten us on thisaffair, but it does not mention the original carving of moai, despite the storytaking place on Easter Island. As with the Inka and the megalithic structures ofthe Andes, the few references appear matter-of-fact, suggesting the statues werealready established on the island at that time. There are only two notablementions in the narrative: one, during a journey back from New Zealand theseafearers are described as “eager to stand beneath the great monuments carvedby the Stone People. Everyone stood in awe of the Mokai, the towering stonefigures shaped by those ancestors to keep the God of Earthquakes quiet in hislair.”18 It is for this reason that the oldest moai face inland, toward thevolcano.[images/00045.jpg]Tukuturi features large eye sockets, long ears and, uncommon for Easter Island,a beard. Similar statues around Lake Titicaca depict Viracocha.The Stone People arrived from the direction of Asia after the flood and duringthe period when the island was densely forested. This implies a more remote agethan the one proposed by academics, who claim the island was already sparselyforested and subsequently depleted as a result of carving moai, the consequenceof which was famine and civil war. The Waitaha claim the Stone People wereconscionable, they knew how \"to shape stone without breaking its spirit,\" justas they held a particular sensitivity towards the environment. Only lunaticswould deplete an already meager infrastructure by embarking on a vanity projectthat exacerbated soil erosion on an overcrowded island. There is also the issueof the island’s indigenous palm trees. Historians claim the trunks were used tomove the statues, however, the bulk of this type of palm is too pulpy to carrysuch heavy loads, the trunks would easily crush, rendering the argument oftransportation and deforestation null and void.The second notable mention is when the Waitaha returned to New Zealand with sixsmall moai totems to be deliberately buried at strategic locations throughoutthree islands, where they remain safely concealed to this day.19Aside from their enigmatic gaze at the sky, the older moai along the slopes ofRano Raraku feature unusually elongated chins. Unlike the typical human facewhere the distance from mouth to chin is twice the distance from mouth to nose,the sculptors of the moai extended the face much lower to represent a beardedchin. Smaller, wooden carvings of the moai are depicted with goatees, along withextended ear lobes, another trait common to the gods, the historians AlbertMetreux and Eve Routledge have even pointed out that four of the moai insideRano Raraku show the same form of goatee. Although the statues have beensubjected to much erosion, a close look at the Rano Raraku group does revealworn vertical lines along the chin indicating stylized beards, while Moai002-077 features a pattern of curved incisions depicting hair on its neck, alongwith traces of red pigment.20 One unusual kneeling statue called Tukuturi showsa bearded giant with elongated ears, carved from the same red volcanic scoria asthe statues of the bearded Viracocha around Tiwanaku. According to the wisdomkeeper of Tongareva — whose ancestors once lived on Easter Island — the beardedeffigies represent the visiting Starwalkers, the Urukehu. It is the later moaiwho represent the chiefs of the island.21Bearded men are not indigenous to this remote Pacific region, but then EasterIsland has an unusual history of unusual people, including the closestdescendent of its last king, a man with high cheekbones and forehead, inset eyesand a beard, features consistent with Caucasians. There were other out-of-placepeople still living on the island in the 18th century. When the first Europeansarrived, an entry in the ship's log describes how a boat came to greet them,steered by a giant of a man: \"With truth, I might say that these savages are allof more than gigantic size. The men are tall and broad in proportion, averagingtwelve feet in height. Surprising as it may appear, the tallest men on board ofour ship could pass between the legs of these children of Goliath withoutbending the head. The women cannot compare in stature with the men, as they arecommonly not above 10 feet high.\"22 These giants were referred to as Long Ears,compared with run-of-the-mill humans, the Short Ears.[images/00046.jpg]Moai with exaggerated, bearded chins.It's not difficult to experience affection for the moai. Their elongated ears,their pouting expression carved so eloquently on enormous blocks of stone, theirarms reaching around a protruding belly to hands with slender, outstretchedfingers spread around a navel. An arresting image. With so much focus on thatnavel, and of course its umbilical connotation, the statues' inherent symbolismcommemorates Easter Island as a fundamental place of creation, a birthplace.If the Waitaha narrative is correct and Hotu Matu’a — \"a child of the gods\" —appeared after the flood from the west to “find the Sacred Birthing Cord of theWorld,”23 the logical assumption is that the island was already a strategiclocation before the flood, much like Tiwanaku. The earliest moai may have beenraised after the flood to re-establish the connection, \"to keep the God ofEarthquakes quiet in his lair,” as the narrative says. After the tectonicconvulsions of 9700 BC, the statues may have served a symbolic as well as apractical, even magical function, after all, these gods are described as havingthe ability to imbue physical substances with life as well as possessing adegree of control over the laws of nature.There's another location where outstretched fingers point to navels, and it toois considered a Navel of the Earth. It lies a world away in Anatolia.GÖBEKLI TEPE, HILL OF OSIRISBeards are not out of place in the Middle East. But belts are, particularly ifthey come with distinctive H and U symbols and attached to slender,anthropomorphic pillars near the summit of a hill in Anatolia by the name ofGöbekli Tepe.[images/00047.jpg]H and U symbols on the pillar’s girdle.The naming of places, people and objects in the ancient world was a seriousaffair, particularly in regard to places of sanctity. A given name enshrined thepurpose for which the site was intended, or reflected a truth about its history.Thus by understanding the original name of Göbekli Tepe we find the singlegreatest clue as to why people of a forgotten era created a monument that isboth out of place and out of time. The latest ground-penetrating radar reveals acollection of between sixteen to fifty large oval stone circles consisting ofelaborately carved pillars up to nineteen feet tall, deliberately interred andmade to resemble a natural hill. This staggering project was built during anepoch when humans were supposed to have been nothing more than primitivehunter-gatherers.Its ancient Armenian, and probably oldest name is Portasar, and it breaks downinto two syllables: port (navel or umbilical cord) identifies the site as aNavel of the Earth, a seeding place where the knowledge of the gods was firstdeposited — where kingship was lowered from heaven, to coin the Mesopotamianphrase. Wherever such epicenters were created, wisdom spread across the landlike ripples, touching the uncivilized and the brute and elevating the potentialof humankind. This alone confers onto Portasar enormous significance.But there’s more. The second syllable asar is revelatory, for it is none otherthan the original name of Osiris, primary Egyptian deity and lord of theOtherworld (Osiris is a later Greek transliteration). It can be said, then, thatGöbekli Tepe is the Umbilical Cord of Osiris, who, as it turns out, was abearded god.[images/00048.jpg]Göbekli Tepe.The site was rediscovered in the 1960s by a team of surveyors from Istanbul andChicago, yet no great importance was given because, to the naked eye, the fewartifacts scattered upon the parched surface were deemed to belong to a recentcivilization. It was not old enough to be of value, and so its true antiquenessand uniqueness were left unrecognized for over three decades until a Germanarchaeological team led by the late Klaus Schmidt realized the enormity of whatmight be concealed below the surface, based on his earlier excavations of anearby site, Nevali Cori, shown by radiocarbon dating to have been inhabited by10,000 BC.Dating sites of extreme antiquity poses enormous challenges. For decades,radiocarbon dating has been deemed a reliable method for providing objective ageestimates for carbon-based materials originating from living organisms. Themethod works by comparing the decay rate of three different carbon isotopes.Over time, one of the isotopes, Carbon-14, decays to nitrogen. Most C-14 isproduced in the upper atmosphere where neutrons produced by cosmic rays reactwith atoms. It then oxidises to create carbon dioxide, which is dispersedthrough the atmosphere. This CO2 is used in photosynthesis by plants, and fromthere is passed through the food chain.There are two issues when using C-14 to date temples. First, few if any organicmaterial is ever taken from beneath megaliths, which would at least identify thedate when the stones were placed The main problem is that the vast majority oftemples were predominantly erected on virgin bedrock. Instead, samples aregenerally taken from the lowest habitation level where soil has accumulated andtrapped organic material.Bear in mind that any sacred space, much like one's own home, would have beenmaintained in a state of cleanliness rather than allowed to fill with dirt anddebris, or food scraps and broken pottery. Therefore what C-14 dating willindicate is a period long after the site has fallen into disuse; the site itselfcould be hundreds, even thousands of years older. Second, mainstream science hasassumed the radioactive decay rate remains constant under all conditions. Itdoesn't. In August 2008 physicists Jere Jenkins and Ephraim Fischback publisheda paper claiming that decay rates are not constant, they fluctuate incorrelation to solar flares as well as the changing distance between the Earthand Sun.24 Naturally this threatened to overturn scientific conventions. Sixtyyears of established science was proven flawed, calling into question the timeframe of prehistory, including the age when megalithic structures were erected.Not surprisingly the Purdue University's physicists have been given the academiccold shoulder.25With this in mind let us examine Göbekli Tepe. The lower habitation layer in thethree primary stone circles, or enclosures, yielded the following dates:Enclosure D, 9990-9600 BC, Enclosure C, c.9700 BC, and the youngest, EnclosureA, 9559-8880 BC. Beyond this point the site was no longer used.26The date range is impressively old. However, virtually all testing came from thefill material dumped into the enclosures after each was carefully packed withdebris. Since the enclosures and their pillars were built upon virgin bedrock,all the C-14 dates tell us is when the enclosures began to be decommissioned.27The archaeological team decided that a more reliable method was to date themortar used in the rough stone walls erected around each enclosure prior totheir interment. Using Enclosure D as an example, the average age returned was9984 BC — that’s before the great flood. Again impressive, except the stonewalls and the mortar were not integral to the original site. The masonry iscrude compared to the elegance of the pillars, and the fact that the walls coverimportant reliefs on the surface of the pillars proves they were added muchlater, at the end of the site's useful life. With these parameters in mind thescientists preliminarily concluded that Enclosure D may be the oldest, with aconstruction date c.10,500 BC, placing part of Göbekli Tepe firmly within theYounger Dryas.28Why should these enclosures, with their dignified T-shape pillars, have beendeliberately buried? Two possibilities come to mind. One, in temple tradition,the sites are designed to mirror specific heavenly bodies, what is referred toas sky-ground dualism. The Waitaha narrative elegantly describes this purpose,with understatement: \"Only when star and stone are held together in one hand isthe mind truly at one with the beginning and the end of the Tai Atea [Cosmos].Only then do we know the oneness of the Universe and walk the deep trails ofwisdom where everything is possible. For the Mind Song is without end; it joinswith the ancestors to know the completeness of the circle of the dream.”29 Afterthe passage of two to four thousand years, however, the Earth's axial rotation —its precession — has changed the planet's position relative to the backgroundstars to which the temple was originally aligned. When this sky-groundrelationship is broken, the temple ceases to mirror the sky and becomes nothingmore than a beautiful enterprise, even if its sanctity remains forever. With itslife span complete, the temple is either sealed, or adjusted and expanded toallow for a fresh astronomical alignment. The temple of Luxor in Egypt, with itstwo distinct axes, is a perfect example.A second possibility is that the site was buried to prevent its destruction.Dating Enclosure D to the mid 10th millennium suggests people were present atGöbekli Tepe three hundred years after the first encounter with a fragmentedmeteorite that triggered the Younger Dryas. By the same token, the C-14 datingof mortar and the lower layer of debris to 9990-9600 BC places the activity onehundred years either side of the second strike that generated the great floodand brought about the end of the Younger Dryas. It would appear people came tothis hill in Anatolia to construct what appears to be a library in stone, thencarefully packed up the site and left prior to the calamity about to unfold. Forthis to happen they must have had foreknowledge of the event, and if they wereexpert astronomers — the site is astronomically significant — they certainlywould have been aware of the cycles that affect and afflict the Earth, and actedprudently to preserve the knowledge therein.A look at the astro-archaeology of Enclosure D, the best preserved so far, oughtto shed more light. It features thirteen T-shaped pillars, each erected on8-inch tall plinths carved in relief on the bedrock, an astonishing engineeringachievement in itself considering how an area of 600 square feet would firstneed to be leveled, then much of it shaved away to leave the raised plinths andthe slots into which the pillars are inserted. Each pillar features a plethoraof animals and symbols carved in relief, many bearing astronomical connotations.It has been suggested that the pillars of Enclosure D were aligned to referencethe setting of the constellation Cygnus.30 It is an elegant theory except itomits one glaring obstacle: the stone circle is not on the summit of the hillbut sits approximately thirty feet below the horizon line, making it verydifficult to observe and mark descending or ascending objects with any accuracyin the northern sky. Additionally, ancient people typically commemorated therising of astral objects or their mid-heaven position, not their setting.However, there is still some merit. A viewer standing on the south perimeter ofthe circle would have used Pillar 43 to mark Cygnus' brief appearance anddescent after sunset, and just before sunrise used Pillar 30 to mark its briefrise before the light of the rising Sun erased the effect.Perhaps a re-examination is in order. After the winter solstice sunset in theepoch c.10,400 BC, a person standing between the two massive central T-pillarsand looking north would have observed Vega, the star then closest to thecelestial pole, glistening like a jewel at 352º, the same angle as centralT-pillars 31 and 18; Vega's position is actually marked by Pillar 43 along thenorthern perimeter, while its 20º elliptical rotation around the celestial polefrom sunset to sunrise is framed within the field of vision of the centralT-pillars. Most importantly, Vega's altitude made it wholly visible above thesummit during the course of the night..Vega’s light is of such magnitude that it features prominently in the lore ofancient cultures, and not surprisingly it was used as a navigational beacon,particularly throughout the Pacific Ocean. Its name derives from the Arabic waqi(falling, swooping), referring to a time when the rotation of its hostconstellation Lyra was seen as a swooping vulture,31 the motion being especiallyobvious during the epoch c.10,400 BC. This might explain why the heavilydecorated Pillar 43 features a prominent relief of a vulture with outstretchedwings, one of which touches a circle; two smaller vultures stand either side.Seen together the birds appear to mimic the circling of Vega around thecelestial pole, each bird representing the star's diminishing brightness as itcompletes its nightly circumpolar journey around an imaginary circle in the sky.[images/00049.jpg]Vega and the passage of the sky on the winter solstice c.10,400 BC. Cygnus isobscured by the hill and rises briefly to the right before dawn. (angle ofEnclosure D shown for illustration only)The siting of Enclosure D below the summit suggests the northern sky was perhapsnot the primary aim of the monument. Turning to face south while Vega isprominent in the north, the belt of Orion can be seen rising briefly above thehorizon, the narrow arc framed by pillars 19 and 33, with Pillar 32 marking itshighest ascension in that era.By comparison, the epoch of 9600 BC — the late C-14 date for Enclosure D — seesVega rising 10 degrees further to the west and well outside the alignment of thecentral pillars, certainly out of alignment with Pillar 43, while Orion hasshifted a few degrees to the southeast but remains acceptably within thepillars' frame of reference.[images/00050.jpg]Enclosure D looking south to Orion’s Belt.[images/00051.jpg]Enclosure D alignments, with Vega the vulture on Pillar 43 circling thecelestial pole.So, what are we to make of this combined reference to the pole star and theascent of Orion’s Belt c.10,400 BC? For one thing it marks a significant periodwhen Orion reaches its lowest meridian transit during the Earth’s 25,920-yearprecession cycle.32 Taking the hill's original name Portasar — the UmbilicalCord of Asar — Osiris is himself associated with Orion, his primary dwellingplace being Giza, the limestone plateau identified in Egyptian texts as Rostau,a gateway to the Otherworld. The researchers Robert Bauval and Adrian Gilberthave convincingly argued that the three main Giza pyramids form the pattern ofOrion’s Belt as it appeared relative to the celestial pole on the spring equinoxin the epoch c,10,400 BC as though some cosmic architect wished to memorializethis date in time. According to Bauval and Gilbert, “what now emerges from thevisual picture of the southern sky at the epoch c.10,400 BC is this: The patternof Orion’s Belt seen on the ‘west’ of the Milky Way matches, with uncannyprecision, the pattern and alignments of the three Giza pyramids!”33Could Göbekli Tepe be an Armenian Giza Plateau, an extension of the house ofOsiris? Certainly there exists a geodetic relationship between the twolocations. Stretching a cord through the corner of the pyramids of Menkaure andKhufu and continuing 700 miles along the surface of the Earth, one arrives atGöbekli Tepe. The margin of error is 1.5º, a miniscule discrepancy given tenthousand years of plate tectonics. With each site referencing Orion's Belt onthe spring equinox and winter solstice respectively, together they mark theopening and closing of an established nine-month ritual cycle.[images/00052.jpg]Giza pyramids ley to Göbekli Tepe.But Göbekli Tepe's siting below the summit and deliberate southeastern exposureisn't just referencing the sky. On a clear day, if one finesses the eye throughpillars 32 and 19, it is possible to see in the distance the ancient observationtower of Harran, far taller back in the day, unmistakably as a lone landmark.Harran lies in what used to be northwestern Mesopotamia. Archaeologicalartifacts date human activity in the region to c.8000 BC. Its earliest name wasHarranu, the nearest translation being Path of the Anu. It was once a majorcenter for astronomy and home to the Sabeans, a group of sages who were amongthe ancient world’s keenest observers of the stars,34 whose name derives fromthe Egyptian Sba (star).35 Their temple city, featuring the aforementionedastronomical tower, was dedicated to the lunar god Su-En (contracted to Sin).The Sabeans were described as \"people of the book\" of Twt — the antediluvianmagician god whom the Greeks call Thoth — and were still consulting it in the11th century, by which time the Greeks had translated it and titled itHermetica. The book was concealed for an unspecified period before beingdiscovered by Leonardo de Pistoia, an agent of Cosimo de Medici, whilejourneying through the Near East in the 14th century.36Harranu is said to have been named in honor of the son of Noah, the Hebrew floodhero.37 Later, Noah's great-grandson Cainan discovered antediluvian inscriptionscarved on standing stones preserving the science of astrology and the secrets ofthe stars, an art taught by antediluvian gods who went by the names Anu andWatchers, who omce lived in this region.38 The Sefer ha-Yashar, a Hebrewmidrash, also records this story.Could Cainan’s carved standing stones be the same pillars so carefully buried atGöbekli Tepe? Because the site appears to have been the focal point of anastronomical cult already in existence prior to the flood, whose practitionersmay have returned to the region to continue the tradition. The Sabeansthemselves were known to be following an older tradition, and were stillundertaking regular pilgrimage to Giza as late as the fourteenth century BC. 39Many of the two hundred limestone pillars so far uncovered at the site areshaped smooth and feature reliefs of birds, bears, snakes, salamanders and othercreatures. The central T-pillars are the tallest: 18 feet high, 4 feet wide anda slender 8 inches thick.40 One of them — again in Enclosure D — hums whenbrushed with the palm of the hand.41 They are anthropomorphic, carved on eitherside with long arms that reach around the corners to hands with slender fingerspointing directly at a navel. Where have we seen this motif? The statues ofTiwanaku and Easter Island, in fact the hands and fingers on a similar pillaruncovered by Klaus Schmidt at Göbekli Tepe's sister site, Nevali Cori, are nearidentical in style to those of the moai.The same is true of the relief animal carvings on Göbekli Tepe's pillars, whofind their twins in Tiwanaku and the nearby sites of Silustani and Cutimbo.This still leaves the question of our earlier observation, the belt withdistinct H and U motifs worn by Göbekli Tepe's anthropomorphic figures. Whilesitting outside the dusty old train station at Tiwanaku I caught up with notesand observations from my journeys. Since so many antediluvian gods around theworld are associated with Orion, could the H be a stylized representation ofthis constellation, like a graphic logo, a symbol of office?And the U, could it refer to the antediluvian god of Mesopotamia, a figuredepicted with fish scales and a beard, just like Viracocha — a god-man by thename U-annu who is regularly depicted holding a strange container?CONTAINERS OF KNOWLEDGEA derivative of Portasar is Gandzasar (Mountain of Treasure), however, in earlytimes treasure did not refer to jewels or loot but to knowledge. The oldestknown iteration of the word is the Greek thesauros (a storehouse, treasure), theroot of thesaurus, in essence a treasure of wisdom contained in words. TheWaitaha refer to such treasure in spiritual terms as taonga.At Göbekli Tepe we find not words but symbols, a storehouse of them, all carvedin relief on enigmatic T-shape pillars. The builders could have saved themselvesa colossal amount of time by simply fashioning raw stone into straight shapes,so the extra effort that went into the T-shape implies purpose, perhaps asymbolic meaning. And nothing in temple design is superfluous or by accident.The T is a culturally shared symbol known in Yucatan and Guatemalan templeculture as the Breath of God,43 just as in the most ancient Japanese and Chinesespiritual traditions it is called Shu-gen-do and Tayi respectively, the supremeknowledge of the gods.44 The Hopi, Zuni and Anasazi applied this symbol and theteaching it represents in their sacred dwellings, one example being the largeT-shape window in the great kiva of Chaco Canyon.[images/00053.jpg]T symbol at Göbekli Tepe, Chichen Itzá ball court, and windows at Palenque.The supreme knowledge of the Cosmos consists of the balance between light anddark forces. Thus the T represents one aspect, and a second T its mirroredopposite. Joining the two and turning the composite image sideways reveals H,the symbol on the belts of the anthropomorphic pillars of Göbekli Tepe. Itfollows that the individuals represented by these totems — much like the moai —must have been people who personified the knowledge, perhaps the gods whobrought the civilizing arts to humanity following the devastation by the flood.Might this also explain the idea behind the curious H-blocks scattered aboutPuma Punku? Was the Breath of God literally and symbolically bestowed onto thewalls of this temple?The H-symbol also forms the underlying design of Mayan ball courts, whereinitiates were taught the secrets of the Cosmos in the ultimate game of life,death and rebirth, also referred to as the Game of the Gods. Never were the ballcourts intended for blood sports, as any respected Mayan elder will inform.45The reference to death is metaphoric, it alludes to the symbolic death of theinitiate leading to the resurrection of the spiritual self. This is why ballcourts — the most exceptional example being Chichen Itza— are lined with friezesdepicting the motions of the planets, the Tree of Knowledge, the creation of theworld, and other sacred teachings. They also incorporate some of the best sonicsknown to architecture, along with angles synonymous with the motions of theEarth. Such details are obviously at odds with the theory erroneously expoundedby western academics.46Which brings us to a striking carving in Enclosure D at Göbekli Tepe, whatappear to be three containers in a row along the top of cryptic Pillar 43. Ithas been a mystery up until now as to what these might represent. The Waitahanarrative provides working proof of the function of these unusual receptacles.Called kete (basket), they represent the container into which all tribalknowledge is deposited; the word is still used by Maori wisdom keepers.Therefore an individual who holds the kete is a wisdom keeper, and this truthaligns perfectly with images of wisdom keepers from Sumeria to Mesoamerica whoare pictured holding the exact same vessel.One of the most fabulous archaeological discoveries in the Olmec world concernsa unique stela of what ancient alien theorists adamantly believe to be anastronaut riding a space capsule, except the capsule is in fact a rattlesnake.But that's not the real riddle here, for in his hand this 'astronaut' — whoincidentally appears to be wearing either a beard or a stylized snake helmet orboth — holds exactly the same container. A close look at the rattlesnake's headreveals a feathered crown, a feature also depicted on the head of Sumerianzoomorphic, falcon-headed figures called Apkallu (sages), the title given to agroup of seven antediluvian emissaries entrusted with bringing the civilizingarts to humanity following the flood.[images/00054.jpg]Long, slim fingers and navels: pillar, Nevali Çori; Göbekli Tepe; a moai.[images/00055.jpg]Containers of wisdom: Pillar 43; Apkallu sage; Quetzcoatl stela, La Venta.Hardly surprising, then, that the Apkallu are regularly depicted standing besidethe Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, picking fruit with one hand andholding a banduddû in the other — the same container held by our Olmecastral-naut, and carved on Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe.Bearded kings such as Ashunarsipal are shown on Sumerian panels standing besidethe Tree of Knowledge, banduddû in one hand, while the other points directly atthe Creator God Ahura Mazda inside his winged disc. Obviously anyone holding thecontainer of knowledge was awarded a privileged position since the object marksits owner as an individual who has gained access to transcendental informationpossessed and revealed by the gods. Mesopotamian friezes and clay seals depictthe first Apkallu — the aforementioned bearded fish-man U-annu (latertransliterated to Ou-anna and Oannes) — holding the banduddû in one hand and ascroll bearing godly information in the other.It stands to reason that the kete carved on Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe not onlyidentifies the site as a location where the gods deposited the same knowledge —for which it was elevated to the status of Navel of the Earth, umbilical cord ofOsiris — it also represents the oldest expression of this symbol, one that hasbeen promulgated from the Middle East to Central America for over 12,000 years.EVIDENCE LIES SIDEWAYSBesides demonstrating the existence of an antediluvian culture with links aroundthe world, the beauty of Göbekli Tepe is how effortlessly it inverts theaccepted academic model concerning the ascent of humanity from rudimentaryexperimentation to highly complex civilization, because on this remotemountaintop in Anatolia these oldest of structures appear fully developed,complex and megalithic, without development or precedent, before devolving overtime. By way of analogy, it is like a group of scientists developing spacerockets only to end up with fireworks.The answer to anomalous places such as this, to paraphrase the late EgyptologistJohn Anthony West, is simple: such civilizations were not developments butlegacies.But there is one further mystery at Göbekli Tepe and it literally lies on theother side of the hill, where the stones were quarried and fashioned from thebedrock. There is something eerie about a 20-foot T-pillar lying on the ground,still partly attached to the bedrock, waiting to be fully detached, polished andtransported. It is as though something interrupted the work in-progress anddestiny took a different course.The reason I find it unsettling is because the situation is repeated far toooften at key megalithic sites — such as the string of abandoned monoliths meantfor Ollantaytambo; or gargantuan rectangular monoliths left idly in a quarry inLebanon, meant for the temple of Baalbek. Like an abandoned moai, there’s acertain melancholy looking at these recumbent stones because it seems theirjourney was abruptly curtailed by some uninvited astral event."},{"pageContent":"> 6. POLYNESIAN BLONDES AND ANDEAN REDHEADSOne wonders how the early Waitaha felt when coming face-to-face with people sodifferent to themselves — flood heroes such as Kiwa, offspring of the Urukehu,with their light skin, golden or red hair and blue or green eyes? Probably muchthe same as early Europeans did when first exploring North America, perplexed bythe rich traditions and myriad languages they discovered as they made contactwith what they'd been led to believe were savages. After all, wasn’t thissupposed to be the uninhabited New World?What fascinated them most was a tribe of indigenous people who looked positivelyCaucasian. In 1738 the French Canadian trader Sieur de la Verendrye, travelingalong the Missouri River in the Dakotas, sent back reports of the Mandan tribe,whom he described as fair-skinned, with red or blonde hair and blue or greyeyes. The women in particular were distinctly Nordic in appearance, and asidefrom clothing, they were indistinguishable.Within fifty years of contact, the tribe was decimated by smallpox. When theexplorers Lewis and Clark visited the Mandan in 1804 they were again describedas “half-white, peaceful, civilized, courteous, and polite.” The pictorialhistorian George Catlin spent several months drawing and painting the Mandan in1832. He too was struck by their Europeaness and how they were more advancedcompared to neighboring tribes: “They are a very interesting and pleasing peoplein their personal appearance and manners, differing in many respects, both inlooks and customs, from all the other tribes I have seen. So forcibly have Ibeen struck with the peculiar ease and elegance of these people, together withtheir diversity of complexions, the various colors of their hair and eyes; thesingularity of their language, and their peculiar and unaccountable customs,that I am fully convinced that they have sprung from some other origin than thatof the other North American Tribes, or that they are an amalgam of natives withsome civilized race.”1The Mandan’s tribal myth is particularly enlightening given how they lived inthe high plains, far from major bodies of open water, yet claimed in nouncertain terms to be descended from a strange white man who appeared aboard acanoe in ancient times after an enormous flood wiped out everything in sight. Hetaught them agriculture, domestication of animals and all the civilizing arts.2Mandan was the name given to Verendrye by his guides, a simplification ofMayadana, however, the tribespeople collectively referred to themselves asNumakaki (People by the River). I couldn't help ruminating on this name and howit sounds like a corruption of Anunaki, People of Anu, antediluvian gods ofMesopotamia said to have descended from heaven and maintained a lineage ofdivine kings and queens long after the flood.[images/00056.jpg]The Mandan or Mayadana.Numakaki shares no obvious linguistic connection with Anunaki, but Mayadanadoes, since it incorporates the syllable ana, a recognized variant of anu. Sinceeach group existed on opposite sides of the world I wasn't sure what to make ofthe relationship, if one exists at all, until I was introduced to a gentlemanfrom an island few outside the central Pacific have heard of, which was toremind me of how western preconceptions of ancient civilizations are oftenincorrect.THE ANU OF TONGAREVATongareva is an atoll with a circumference of forty-eight miles enclosing anazure lagoon. Nine degrees south of the equator and two hundred miles from itsnearest neighbor in the Cook Islands group, it is literally in the middle of thePacific Ocean and sits atop the highest submarine volcano, 16,000 feet from theocean floor. Tongareva means ‘island floating in space’, and seen from space itlooks exactly like the name implies.There are 213 people living on the island today. Teokotai Andrew is a descendentof one of the oldest families and has been given responsibility for safeguardinghis ancestors’ genealogies and oral traditions. He is quite possibly the tribes’sole surviving wisdom keeper. \"We have links with Teiwanaku and Te titi o Motutaiko i titikaka,\" he said, referring to Tiwanaku and Lake Titicaca. \"Peru isthe homeland of my ancestors, my people come from a lady called Punaruku who isfrom Puno.\"3Puno to Tongareva is a six thousand-mile excursion. Not surprisingly I was keento hear what else Teokotai had to share regarding Tongaveran tradition, handeddown from generation to generation. As curious researchers find, if you askpolitely and demonstrate good intentions, people in Teokotai's position aregenerous with their time and accumulated knowledge, and the stories inevitablypaint a picture that diverges dramatically from the one promoted by academics,especially as they were directly experienced by people who lived thousands ofyears closer to the events. For that reason alone I view such accounts as morereliable.During our conversations Teokotai informed me about \"an island disappearing inthe sea, we call it Motu Taiko [the land that disappears and re-appears], itused to exist in the vicinity of the Cook Islands. My ancestors left Motu Taikoafter the flood covered the island, in search of a very similar landscape withwater around it. One tribe who arrived in Tongareva from Motu Taiko were calledTiti, or Maori, they had blonde and red hair, fair-skinned, blue eyes and greeneyes. In our language maori means ‘fair skinned voyager’.”4 Many Tongarevansstill bear such physiognomy.I thought for one excited second that the story of the disappearing islandreferred to the great deluge, but it turns out this particular event took placein the ancient past rather than the remote past, and climatic data shows anotable sea level rise of twenty-six feet occurred between 3200-2500 BC, enoughto drown many of the Pacific’s low-lying islands. This is the epoch described inthe tradition. Naturally it caused a migration to Tongareva, as Teokotaiexplains: \"They were called the people of Tupenaki or Tupenake, also known asAnunaki or Anunake, they came from Saupewa [Mesopotamia]. The Titi/Maori peoplefrom Motu Taiko and the Tupenake all met in Tongareva, intermarried, andtogether became Hare Vananga [House of Knowledge].”5This was quite a revelation. The Anunaki are believed to have been singularlyinvolved in Mesopotamia, if one accepts the conventional argument, and theirassociation with the great flood places them in the same region much earlier, inthe period of the Younger Dryas. The Tongareva tradition demonstrates thelineage continued for another 6000 years, and whereas the Anunaki have alwaysbeen described as gods, Tongarevans bring them down to earth. According toTeokotai, \"most historical facts about the Tupenaki/Anunake are exaggerated.They are not gods but normal people, great sages, star navigators andintelligent human beings.”6Of course it all depends on one's definition of a god. In ancient times the termapplied to any individual capable of understanding and bending the laws ofnature. But the bigger questions on my mind were, what would have driven a groupof sages in the Middle East to travel all the way to a remote island in themiddle of the Pacific? And how could the Anunaki still be living some sixthousand years after the flood?The first thing to examine is their possible reason for migrating. The Pacificwas not the only place affected by rising seas 5000 years ago, Mesopotamia toowas subjected to a significant incursion of the ocean, validating the Tongarevanarrative; an earlier incursion of the sea c.8600 BC led to the creation of thePersian Gulf. Still, if I were living in Mesopotamia in 2600 BC my naturalimpulse would have been to move inland, not take off to the middle of the ocean.Clearly something possessed the Anunaki to undertake a 9000-mile sea voyage, andthe most rational explanation is they already had an established presence insuch a remote region going back to prehistoric times.I wondered if there might be a connection between the Anunaki and the red hairedUrukehu who once arrived in Easter Island from the direction of Tiwanaku. Thisis where Teokotai dropped another bombshell: \"The flood is recorded in myancestor's chants, stories and tradition. My remote ancestors came from TePitaka, a circular island with water around it, which was situated in Te Piupiuo Nahari Kiokura [Arabian Peninsula]. This was around the time of the flood, butthat land today bears no resemblance to what it looked like then, there isvirtually no trace of it. They came via Teiwanaku, well after the flood. We haveproof in our stories and chants as well as ancestral genealogical names fromthose areas. Te Pitaka was also the ancient name of Tongareva, so that thepeople remembered their original homeland.”7A missing land of the gods in the vicinity of the Arabian Peninsula? This is arevolutionary upturning of history, to say the least.The Tongavera tradition not only places the Anunaki in the central Pacificc.3000 BC, it also claims the link extends back to the great flood, when theylived on an island somewhere in the region of what is today a vast desert. Ifthey also journeyed westerly from Tiwanaku, ostensibly the Anunaki may be thesame people as Viracocha and his seven white-skinned, red-haired Shining Ones,least of all because the same description of the Anunaki is given in post-floodMesopotamia: seven sages (apkallu) led by a charismatic leader appear from thesea, depicted as half-human half-fish and nicknamed Shining Ones. Both groupswere tall and bearded. We could just as well be describing the Urukehu, in factit looks as though these once disparate groups of gods now appear to be one andthe same people.There exists a monument in the hills of Abu Dhabi that may provide the link inthis Andean-Pacific-Mesopotamian connection. It is said to be a burial site fromc.3000 BC, but the basis for the date is purely speculative. Sited in the townof Al Ayin, it is a round structure, 36-feet in diameter by 14-feet in height,buried in dirt until 1967, after which it was faithfully restored; the thicknessand slope angle of the walls suggest it may have once been much taller, perhapsa tower. If visitors from Tiwanaku were taken here blindfolded they would assumethey’d never left the Andes, because the design and method of construction areidentical to the flood-era megalithic temples around Lake Titicaca, in fact itbears a resemblance to the chullpas, the round towers at Silustani and Cutimbo.Both the Al Ayin enclosure and the chullpas feature the same tiny entrancealigned to the equinox, and both have been mistaken for tombs (the chullpas wereshown in my book The Lost Art of Resurrection to have been originally used for arestricted initiation ritual).8[images/00057.jpg]Al Ayin chamber masonry identical to Easter Island ahu, and Andean chullpas.It would seem the same culture built the same monuments, in the same style, inthe same era on two separate continents. And if you throw in the numerous ahu ofEaster Island, Tahiti, Tinian, Tonga and Fiji we are left with an unbrokenmegalithic fingerprint stretching in a band from the high Andes, across thePacific to the Middle East.BUILDER GODS IN THE PACIFICWhen European explorers first ventured into the Pacific they were oftenastonished at the sight of megalithic structures on uninhabited islands, someaccounts describing the stone platforms on Malden Island or Kiribati asindistinguishable from those in South America. The Marquesas — Hiva Oa, inparticular — were once filled with colossal ahu. The novelist Herman Melviledescribed them while marooned there: “One day in returning from this spring by acircuitous path, I came upon a scene which reminded me of Stonehenge... a seriesof vast terraces of stone rises, step by step, for a considerable distance upthe hillside. These terraces cannot be less than one hundred yards in length andtwenty in width. Their magnitude, however, is less striking than the immensesize of the blocks composing them. Some of the stones, of an oblong shape, arefrom ten to fifteen feet in length, and five or six feet thick. Their sides arequite smooth, but though square, and of pretty regular formation, they bear nomark of the chisel. They are laid together without cement.... Kory-Kory, who wasmy authority in all matters of scientific research, gave me to understand thatthey were coeval with the creation of the world; that the great gods themselveswere the builders.”9On Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, there are three-tiered platforms calledlangi, made of megalithic slabs of limestone, with older sections made ofbasalt, closely fitted, featuring the type of L-shaped elbow design common toSaqsayhuaman and Egypt’s Valley Temple. Basalt is found nowhere near Tongatapu.Myth states such stone was moved by magic from the volcanic island of Uvea somesix hundred miles away. There is also a massive, dolmen-style structure calledHa’amonga a Maui, made of eight-feet thick, fifteen-feet tall coral slabs, saidto have been brought to the island by the god Maui on a giant canoe afterraising the islands from below the ocean. Could this be the same Màui, grandsonof the flood heroes, featured in the Waitaha narrative?[images/00058.jpg]L-shape allows great structural integrity but is labor-intensive, requiringextensive removal of stone.Coincidentally, mawi is an Egyptian word meaning 'navigator or guide', while therelated word haawi in the Hopi language means 'to descend'. Tonga's ancientcapital itself, Mu’a, is said to memorialize the name of the land destroyed by aglobal flood where such gods lived. To the west, in New Guinea — along with NewHanover, New Britain and New Ireland — tribespeople speak of megaliths,pyramids, basalt obelisks, and petroglyphs left by “men belong time before,”unusual people of whom they speak with great respect, who were culturallysuperior and appeared out of nowhere on large canoes, hiding many artefacts onthe sacred mountain called The Mother before disappearing back into the sea.James Sheridan, a government malaria expert traveling to the region in the1950s, saw the obelisks himself, carved with lines, fish and bird-like headsfacing the rising sun. These wandering gods also shaped rocks as large as adouble garage and covered them with petroglyphs of unusual figures. Oneplantation owner recalls how the megaliths reminded him of ones back in hisnative Germany, in fact he was adamant they were linked to the same type ofmegalithic constructions found in Egypt and the Andes.A man by the name of Jack West, who lived in New Guinea in the 1920s, recallsfinding massive carved boulders near the town of Wewak. He located others onnearby islands, along with an obelisk some eight feet high, all facing therising Sun; surrounding it was a group of smaller stones with petroglyphs, bythen half buried. Larger megaliths were discovered in New Guinea by a planternamed Peter Murray, who found a stone circle \"like Stonehenge\" on Unea, the mainisland in the Vitu group. \"The stones are rectangular, each about eleven feetlong, and carved with circles and squiggly lines like hieroglyphs. Two old men,Uva and Umbelevi, guided me to where they are positioned on top of a 2500-footpeak known as Kambu. The stones are not volcanic; obviously they have beenquarried elsewhere and taken up the mountain by some means. They are so ancientthat the natives do not even have legends about them.\"10On the western side of Tahiti there's a fine example of a step pyramid, 267 feetlong by 87 feet wide, featuring nine tiers. The megalithic architecture is madewith stones as much as 8 feet in length, shaped and close-fitted without mortar.Such step pyramids reach their acme in size and complexity on the CarolineIslands, while the deserted Malden Island features megaliths, and roads builtwith close-fitting basalt slabs that continue under the sea.[images/00059.jpg]Step pyramid, Tahiti[images/00060.jpg]Standing stones, Fiji.[images/00061.jpg]ahu on Malden Island[images/00062.jpg]Tonga is packed with one megalithic curiosity after another.[images/00063.jpg]Obviously built on a human scale. One side of the three megaliths formingHa’amonga ‘a Maui.[images/00064.jpg]One of the smaller ahu on Tonga.But are these monuments the remnants of a destroyed civilization or were theybuilt from scratch after the flood? Or both, an overlap, a refurbishment, muchlike the two oldest layers of megalithic architecture in the Andes, comparativeyet separate? When myth becomes a reliable memory of past events it completesthe picture that archaeology cannot. In Samoan mythology, the outlying Manu’aarchipelago is said to be the first island of creation, a navel of the earth,while the island of Savai’i is claimed to be a remnant of Havai’iki, theoriginal homeland of the antediluvian gods and birthplace of Polynesian culture.Certainly it features the largest mounds in all Polynesia, and what else mayexist now lies beneath thick lava flows from the islands' dozen or so volcanoes,which sit atop the biggest shield volcano in the Pacific.The Indonesian island of Flores is another place with its own share of enigmas,out-of-place artifacts, and stories of unusual people doing unusual things. TheNages who live in the center of the island recall the story of the forefather ofthe tribe, Dooy, and how he was saved from the great flood by a ship. His gravelies beneath a large stone platform in the public square of the tribal capitalBoa Wai. A harvest festival honoring this great ancestor still takes place tothis day, when the presiding chief is adorned with a gold model of a ship withseven masts, in memory of the fortunate survival of their ancestor.11In the main public space of the village of Bena stands a group of menhirs anddolmens that are used as instruments of communication with people in theOtherworld — much like the megalithic traditions of Europe, except that the rootof this Flores tradition arises from the ancestors of the region who arrivedafter a great flood around 12,000 years ago, on a ship propelled by an engine,no less! Their descendents laid out the entire village in the shape of the ship,with a large megalithic chamber marking the place where the engine house wouldhave been. The megaliths themselves were moved to the village from the slopes ofa mountain twelve miles away by the use of special powers possessed by theseancestors, one of whom is described as a giant by the name of Dhake.12THEY MIGHT BE GIANTSIt’s funny how the topic of giants keeps rearing its head here and there, andalthough I originally had no intention to pursue this topic, it is so intrinsicto the understanding of the missing antediluvian civilization that it shouldn’tbe overlooked. In most flood myths the outsiders are described as very tall, butwhether their height was relative to indigenous people, or they were trulygigantesque, is not always clear. Being a six-foot five-inch tall, whiteCaucasian I might be looked upon as a giant in the Andes, whereas in CentralEurope I would merely be tall; in Norway I am actually normal. Too bad I nolonger have the blonde hair I had as a child because, with my green eyes, I toomight have been mistaken for Viracocha!But seriously, I want to return to my conversations with Teokotai the wisdomkeeper, whose stories are never short on illumination.He states there are numerous accounts on Tongareva of tall ancestors with redhair, but to confuse matters, they are twenty-two feet tall, fair skinned, withblue or green eyes. One of their massive graves was exhumed in 1969 by a team ofanthropologists from the University of Osaka under the auspices of the UnitedNations. They unearthed bones of a twenty-two-foot long humanoid skeleton,beneath which they found urns. As they attempted to remove the items a boomingvoice emerged from the lagoon warning them, in no uncertain terms, they’d seenenough and to put back the artefacts. Shaken, the anthropologists left and neverreturned.13 I contacted the university to solicit an opinion but no one wishedto revisit the topic.An individual of similar stature washed up on a beach near the north-western tipof New Zealand in the 1950s, found by a young girl whose mother called theauthorities, who hauled the remains onto a flat bed truck, drove off, and thecase was never brought up again. Residents of the densely forested island ofIsatabu in the Solomon Islands come face-to-face with such giants on a regularbasis. Even during the Second World War, Japanese and American troops stationedthere witnessed the giants, to the point where the thought of being attacked bythem gave the soldiers plenty of sleepless nights. As one former Air Forceofficer said, \"The people of the Solomon Islands have shared their islands witha race of hominoids previously undiscovered to the modern world for millenniaright to this present day. The larger and more commonly seen are over 10 foottall, but I have come across numerous islander accounts with evidence thatsupports that they do grow much taller than that.\"14The giants are said to inhabit the island's vast tunnel system which is composedof a type of self-illuminating stone. This invites a comparison with adescription of the Hebrew flood narrative and its hero Noah, whose \"Ark wasilluminated by a precious stone, the light of which was more brilliant by nightthan by day, so enabling Noah to distinguish between day and night.\"15 Noah'sZoroastrian counterpart Yima had the same assistance inside the Vara he wasinstructed to build, illumination for which was provided by means of a \"window,self-shining from within.\"16 As the god Ahura Mazda explained to Yima, \"thereare uncreated lights and created lights.\"17 The first account clearly specifiesa stone; the second, however, seems more like technology.Incidentally, Isatabu literally means Sacred Abode of Isis. In the Pacific oneis never far from an Egyptian word or two.North of the Fijian group lies an isolated, nine mile-long island called Rotuma.For such a small place it is filled with mysteries of ages long gone. Itsinhabitants are noted for their significantly lighter skin color as thoughrepresenting a different race altogether.18 During the Second World War, coastwatchers were building a viewing station on the summit of Mt. Sororoa when theyunearthed shin bones over 3 feet long, making the person to whom it belonged 12feet tall. The whole mountaintop was an ancient cemetery, as were nearby caves —while searching for places to hide in case of a Japanese invasion, the localsfound the caves filled with giant human skeletons.Graveyards are also aplenty in the village of Itu’mut. The small size of theisland leaves inhabitants little choice but to stack the graves above ground andrecycle them every twenty years or so. The thing is, the modern graves areplaced on top of megalithic platforms built by people from a forgotten era.Looking at them one could be mistaken for being in Saqsayhuaman, so precise andsimilar is the masonry. Adjacent to this plot are graves of a different kind,marked with stones of enormous size, beneath which lay the remains of 12-foottall people. A road built in 1927 accidentally uncovered graves of identicalskeletons but, due to superstition, the bones were quickly reburied and the roadre-routed.19Despite having little land above water nowadays, Fiji enjoys a disproportionatenumber of megalithic sites — at least twenty-nine —as though the island is afragment of a once larger landmass. Many archaeological sites feature rock artwith concentric rings and dots in a style identical to that used in Europe tomark stars and other astronomical data; near Vuna, a pair of menhirs are carvedwith circular cup-and-ring marks, the kind thought to have been unique towestern Scotland.One massive dolmen is of the type commonly seen in Korea and western Siberia;the council meeting place of Na Ututu resembles a scaled-down version of aGuatemalan pyramid: and the sacred hill Takiveleyawa, which is said to be aportal to the Otherworld, resembles the kind of hills in Yucatan once mistakenas natural but later proven to be man-made structures. When did thiscivilization exist in Fiji?Many sites are now partly submerged, indicating their extreme antiquity, placeslike Sawailau, a sacred cave and abode of an ancient god by the name of Ulutini.It lies to the northwest of Fiji on the island of Yasawa. A diver with excellentlungs can reach this air pocket and gaze at a series of beautifully etchedpictograms on the cave wall. The mouth of the cave was last above sea level 5000years ago, so the carvings must be significantly older. The most recognizable isa horizontal lozenge shape of the type used by early Neolithic people to markthe extreme positions of the Sun at the solstices. Because the angle of therising Sun changes relative to one's latitude, the lozenge changes shapeaccordingly — the closer to the equator the more horizontal, the closer to thepole the more vertical.The Yasawa lozenge has a horizontal aspect and precisely matches the Sun’sposition at the latitude of the cave. But there’s an appendage like a bowattached to the right of the design as though marking some other object risingin the east. Just below, a line of three fist-size circular protrusions arecarved in relief, with one of the circles offset from the other two. Thecombination bears a remarkable resemblance to the three stars of Orion’s belt.Perhaps the 'bow' above this relief refers to Orion's club. Let's see.[images/00065.jpg]Orion’s Belt inside Yasawa cave. Note lozenge with appendage.[images/00066.jpg]Orion’s shield.[images/00067.jpg]Shape formed by the solstices at this latitude.As we have already seen, the Orion constellation was of prime importance toancient cultures — something we’ll examine in detail later — particularly itsheliacal rising at the winter solstice and spring equinox. If we roll back thenight sky as though we are sitting at the mouth of Sawailau cave when it wasstill above sea level, two prominent occasions appear on the horizon. The firstis 13,000 BC when Orion’s Belt aligns with the horizon on the spring equinox.The second is when the entire constellation appears for the first time above thehorizon, the epoch of 9500 BC. Is it possible people marked this alignment tocommemorate the onset of the Oldest Dryas, then returned to this marker twohundred years after the Younger Dryas? Were they referencing the new sky, likenavigators charting missing lands in this drastically rearranged landscape? Icould not help but be reminded of the Waitaha narrative after the world was“turned by water,” when Kiwa arrives on Easter Island, from which he makesnumerous voyages across the Pacific, charting its remaining lands, many of whichhad become islands following the dramatic rise in sea level.20 Could this cavehave been a point of reference?Fiji is not the only archipelago with connections to a post-diluvial race. Onthe small atoll of Lae in the Marshall Islands there is the legend of a hugecylinder made of timber that came ashore filled with giants, weak from driftingacross the ocean. The fearful villagers overpowered and killed them, but upondiscovering that one was a princess they were filled with remorse, and to thisday the islanders toss a food offering into the sea to ask forgiveness wheneverthey pass by the islet where she is buried.But from which missing land did these people drift? Legends in Samoa claim thata tribe of giants, the Hiti, lived there before a great flood, while Aboriginesof the Northern Territories claim the area near the Brimmy Valley was onceBurrangie, the secret place of the giant people from the Dreamtime.Or maybe they came from the island of Tinian in the Marianas archipelago, hometo a most unusual set of megaliths collectively known as the House of Taga.Sometime in prehistory a ten-foot tall chief named Taga erected two parallelrows of monoliths, fifteen feet in height, topped with enormous hemisphericalcaps hollowed into cups. Of the twelve upright stones sketched by explorerGeorge Anson in 1742, only one remains upright due to earthquakes. The House ofTaga was just one of eighteen such structures on Tinian, all out of place andtime.21[images/00068.jpg]House of Taga as it appeared in 1742.RETURNING TO BLONDES AND REDHEADSTeokotai Andrew's narrative of fair-skinned, red or blonde-haired voyagersarriving from the Middle East via the Andes is corroborated by anotherindigenous group of New Zealand, the Ngati Hotu. Historians such as J.M. McEwenresearched the tribe for nearly two decades based on the writings of Maorielders Raniera Te Ahiko and Paramena Te Naonao. A quote from one elder about theNgati Hotu makes some startling claims: \"Generally speaking, Ngati Hotu were ofmedium height and of light colouring. In the majority of cases they had reddishhair... and were spoken of as Te Whanau a Rangi [Children of Heaven] because oftheir fair skin. There were two distinct types. One had kiri wherowhero orreddish skin, a round face, small eyes and thick protruding eyebrows. The otherwas fair-skinned, much smaller in stature, with larger and very handsomefeatures. The latter were the true urukehu and Te Whanau a Rangi. In some casesnot only did they have reddish hair, but also light coloured eyes.\"22Fair skin, light color eyes, children of heaven? What's going on here?When Captain Wallis arrived in Tahiti from England on an exploratory voyage in1767 he was astonished to find over ten per cent of Tahitians were white-skinnedand blonde, with the greatest concentration living on the island of Ra-Iatea —literally 'White-skinned People of Ra'. Local traditions claim that most ancientMaori tribes intermarried both blonde, blue-eyed people and red-hairedgreen-eyed people who'd migrated from afar.23 The historian J.M. Brown notedsimilar Caucasian features still prevalent in many Easter Islanders during hisvisit to the island in 1920: “There is a general consensus of the European-likefeatures and colour of many of the natives of Easter Island. And the faces ofthe images confirm this Caucasoid impression; they are oval, straight-nosed,large-eyed, thin-lipped and short in the upper lip, the features thatdistinguish or are supposed to distinguish the highest ideal of beauty of thenorth-west of Europe.” 24Thor Heyerdahl himself was persuaded that the red volcanic tufa cylinders foundatop many moai, like crowns, are representative of the Urukehu's red hair, afterall it would have been far easier to carve these additions as one piece with thestatues, an observation made earlier by the archaeologist Henry Balfour. For onething, Polynesians used to dye their black hair red to simulate the gods.25Where does this leave the Ngati Hotu? Despite their near-extinction at the handsof invading Maori tribes in the 14th century, a fair number still exist today inNew Zealand. They are described not simply as manifesting the Urukehu strain,but as direct ancestors of the Urukehu themselves.26 Their oral traditionsunequivocally state they are of Middle Eastern origin, specifically from Persiaand Egypt, forced out of the region long ago by war with dark skin people,compelling their ancient predecessors to sail to Madagascar, around Africa,across the Atlantic, settling for a time in Yucatan and Central America. Laterthey migrated south to the Andes, contributing to the culture around LakeTiticaca before finally sailing westwards to Easter Island and New Zealand.Based on the evidence presented so far, it appears they were following in thefootsteps of the Anunaki, merely taking the long route.Fed up of having her tribe's traditions brushed under the carpet by historiansand government officials alike, an elder of the Ngati Hotu by the name of MonicaMatamua — who is blonde and blue eyed — submitted a sample of her DNA to theNational Geographic Society DNA Register. The results validated her claim: theNgati Hotu's origins were to be found in the Middle East, the Steppes, Egypt,Madagascar and Central America, with the most recent concentrations around LakeTiticaca and Easter Island.27[images/00069.jpg]Blonde and green-eyed, and still lovely as a grandmother. Monika Matamua of theNgati Hotu of New Zealand — and Egypt and the Middle East.All in all, fifteen New Zealand tribes feature fair skin, red hair and greeneyes, or blonde hair and blue eyes, and most of them claim a part in thenation’s prehistory, the one academics and latter-day Maori claim does notexist.THE ART OF LONG OCEAN TRAVELMonica's DNA aside, there is an artefact that may corroborate the Ngati Hotu’spresence in the Andes. A large stone bowl unearthed by a farmer in 1958 nearLake Titicaca is inscribed with a fertility figure and inscriptions in twolanguages, one Puqara, the other proto-Sumerian from c.3000 BC.28 It has been amystery as to how a proto-Sumerian bowl of such antiquity could have appeared inthe Bolivian altiplano five thousand years ago. Now it appears to have beentaken there by the ancestors of at least two peoples from the Middle East.Virtually every flood myth of god-men who come out of nowhere to rebuild humancivilization connects them with the sea in some way, they always arrive on boatsor double-hull canoes, leading to the conclusion they were master seafarers withlong-term experience of navigating the open ocean as well as a proficiency inastronomy that moved them efficiently from A to B. They were intimate with theEarth's topography and clearly knew where they were headed, setting down aprecedent for later people to follow.One of the anomalies surrounding these long distance navigators centers aroundtwo massive cedarwood boats concealed in deep pits at the foot of the pyramidsof Giza. The Egyptians of the historical period were not known for theirseafaring skills, allegedly opting to become masters of chariots and calmnavigation up and down the Nile. The boats contravene this theory. The largestof the two is 141 feet long, with a high prow than would have made it not onlyan extraordinarily stable sea-going vessel but would have out-performed even theformidable Viking knarr and sixteenth century European galleys, products ofexpert shipbuilding from people with a long, solid tradition of sailing the openseas.29 Therefore, either ancient Egyptians were master seafarers, or a selectgroup of foreign master seafarers arrived in Egypt from the eastern oceans andleft behind a legacy of ocean travel. Could these people have made regular, longdistance voyages from as far as South America? Given the influence of Egyptianlanguage on islands throughout the Pacific, along with Thor Hyerdahl's famousKon Tiki voyage, the answer is, highly probable.RED HAIR AND LONGHEADSIn 1928 more than three hundred skeletal remains were found near Paracas byPeruvian archaeologist Julio Tello, all bearing the most extreme examples ofelongated skulls ever found. Because of the dry climate, some still had hairattached — red hair, and the color was not a result of a change in pigment fromburial in soil containing tannins or iron.Nor was their elongation the product of deliberate cranial deformation. It iswell known that Peruvian mothers bound the heads of infants so that in timetheir skulls would come to resemble those of the gods of old, presumably tobestow higher social status upon their offspring. The practice was still popularin the Middle Ages in central and southern Europe, when high-ranking treatybrides from Romania and Bulgaria with deliberately induced elongated skulls weremarried off to nobles to cement political alliances.30 However, at firstimpression, such skulls look really unnatural, ridiculous, cone headed.The Paracas skulls, on the other hand, are simply unusual and, despite thedeformation, they bear an air of grace. According to Brien Foerster, director ofthe Paracas History Museum, such skull elongation is caused by genetics, withsome of the elongated skulls' cranial volume being up to 25 percent larger and60 percent heavier than conventional human skulls. Thus they could not bedeformed purposely through flattening or head binding, since the skull's shapecan be changed by cranial deformation yet its volume and weight remain the same.[images/00070.jpg]Andean longheads. Cranial volume is 25% larger than human skulls.The Paracas skulls are also significantly different to homo sapiens in that theyhave highly pronounced cheek bones, larger eye sockets, and most importantly, nosagittal suture — the connective tissue joint between the two parietal bones ofthe skull. There is also the issue with the position of the foramen magnum — theopening at the base of the skull though which the spinal cord passes — which onthe Paracas skulls is in a different location and cannot be the result ofartificial binding, it is a purely genetic trait.31And that wasn't the end of it. Hair sequencing determined these individuals tohave come from a H2A genetic population group found in Eastern Europe, whilebone powder tests revealed a T2B group which heralds from Mesopotamia.32Further DNA tests on the skulls revealed mitochondrial DNA with mutationsunknown in any human, primate or animal known so far. In other words, we aredealing with a new human type that is very different to Homo sapiens,Denisovians or Neanderthals. Plus, the Paracas skulls share DNA with otherelongated cranium people found between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,31 aregion that includes Armenia, and once adjacent to Persia and Mesopotamia.And thanks to a grandmother in New Zealand we now have a clearer picture of justhow far around the globe the people of this region journeyed."},{"pageContent":"> 7. BUILT BEFORE THE FLOOD REDUXWith much evidence supporting the existence of a megalithic building culturethroughout the Pacific before and after the flood, it is reasonable to ask iftheir handiwork exists in New Zealand. In the middle of a forest to the east of Lake Taupo there is a cryptic structurecalled the Kaimanawa wall, consisting of rectangular blocks of volcanic stone —ignimbrite, according to a government geologist — each weighing four tons. Withtheir smoothed faces and squared corners, the regular shape of the blocks isinconsistent with the action of weathering on ignimbrite.The exposed portion of the wall reveals two levels of stacked blocks, anddespite accumulated humus and tree roots the shape is suggestive of an ahu orperhaps the summit of a truncated pyramid. Like most pyramids, the structure isaligned to Grid North.Prior to visiting the Kaimanawa wall, Waitaha elders approached the Tuwharetoa,the regional Maori tribe, who informed them the stones were of no significanceto them, even fell outside accepted traditional Maori boundaries.1I had the opportunity to visit the site with ancient history author Gary Cookand fellow enthusiasts under the cover of 'lost tourists', for reasons that willbecome apparent. Indeed the layered blocks have a symmetry about them and, forthe most part, are fitted as well as any megalithic structure I have seen,despite long-term exposure to the elements. Standing on the top of the moundfeels as though an electrical current runs up the spine, a feeling oftenencountered when standing near the magnetic hotspot of active sacred sites.The removal of another six feet of soil revealed a third, lower layer composedof larger megaliths, meticulously cut and polished as though machined in amodern factory, with hardly, if any signs of weathering. The floor was clearedof soil to reveal a perfectly smooth and level stone platform extending at leastsix feet away from the wall. I jumped into the rectangular hole and my feet weremet by a most unexpected sound: a booming echo from below as though the platformis in fact the ceiling of a large sealed chamber.[images/00071.jpg]Exposed blocks of the Kaimanawa wall.[images/00072.jpg]Fellow researcher and author Gary Cook examines the blocks.[images/00073.jpg]The concealed lower level revels a polished block and a platform over whatsounds like an inner chamber.The highly volcanic nature of this region has covered the area with layer uponlayer of ash over two hundred feet deep, yet this is hardly the reasonpreventing the anomalous structure from being excavated and analyzed. Once thelower course of stones was discovered, indicating an artefact of considerableimportance, the Maori council changed its tune overnight and the site becameculturally significant, allowing the council to issue an official order banningany further digging.2 All this despite common knowledge that Maori never workedwith stone, nor built sacred sites made of stone. To quote the New Zealandhistorian Elsdon Best: “The Maori never erected anything in the form of atemple. He made no attempt to add impressiveness to his ritual performances bymeans of any artificial erection, indeed he was strongly prejudiced againstperforming rites elsewhere than out in the open. So far as we are aware,the tapu houses in which tribal lore was taught were the only buildings in whichimportant rites were ever performed. The Maori preferred to carry out suchfunctions in the open, not under a roof, and away from all artificialstructures… Inasmuch as the tuahu, or tapu places whereat rites were performedby the native priests, were of such a simple or primitive form, it follows thatthere might well be a difficulty in recognising such places when seen. Theywere, in some cases, apparently not marked by anything, being merely a smallopen space... Some were marked by one or more unworked stones, or a small woodenpost. Occasionally a small, rough wooden platform, elevated on stakes, termeda tiepa, was erected, on which offerings were placed… It is a peculiar andinteresting fact that the Maori has never constructed in New Zealandthe marae or stone pyramids of his former home in eastern Polynesia. We mightthink that those erections are of comparatively modern date, erected since theancestors of the Maori left those parts, but the late Colonel Gudgeon hasrecorded the fact that some knowledge of them has been preserved by the Maori.An old native informed him that those marae or stepped, truncated pyramids, wereplaces where religious rites were performed... If the Maori constructed, atgreat expense of labour, the great stone pyramids of Tahiti, why and how did heacquire in New Zealand such a strong distaste for anything like an elaboratealtar?”3Geologists, in comical contradiction to the Maori, claimed the perfectlyrectangular stone blocks were produced by the natural fracturing of hotignimbrite when it cools — despite the fact that no similar example can beproduced because the unconsolidated nature of ignimbrite does not allow it toform perfectly smooth and symmetrical slabs with corners that turn at ninetydegrees. To their further embarrassment, when a sample of the wall was analyzedat a laboratory in Auckland it was found to be not ignimbrite but another typeof volcanic stone, rhyolite, which only occurs naturally ten miles to the westof Lake Taupo, meaning that the raw material for the wall had to have beenphysically transported to the site.4Antediluvian or post-diluvial? Department of Conservation archaeologists simplydebunked the site so as not to contravene the politically acceptable paradigmthat no culture existed in New Zealand before the arrival of Maori in 1200 AD,despite the Kaimanawa wall being covered by debris from the 232 AD eruption of avent in Lake Taupo which dumped a six-foot layer of ash over the region.5As for the Waitaha, they claim it isn't theirs either, it precedes theirculture.THE ENLIGHTENING MOUNTAIN OF JAVABefore sea levels rose dramatically at the end of the Younger Dryas, thearchipelago that is Indonesia was joined to southeast Asia and formed aformidable piece of land referred to by geologists as Sundaland. After theflood, Indonesia lost more habitable land than anywhere on Earth, making thesearch for a lost civilization in this part of the world that more enticing and,paradoxically, more difficult.6 Geometric engravings “indicative of moderncognition and behavior” have been found on Java, one of the largest islands, anddated to half a million years ago — that's over a quarter of a million yearsbefore the alleged appearance of anatomically modern humans.7The Javanese have been climbing to the summit of the Mountain of Enlightenmentsince remote times. In 1914 it was the turn of a group of archaeologists. There,they found dense undergrowth and trees sprouting out of a man-made rectangularcourt composed of large pieces of columnar basalt, hundreds of them. Eventuallyit was realized that no less than five terraces were covered with thesestructures, which were regularly used for meditation by local people. Despitesaying so, the villagers failed to persuade the scientists that the entire hillwas a man-made step pyramid.[images/00074.jpg]A mountain that is a step pyramid. The summit temples of Gunung Padang.It would be nearly one hundred years before another archaeologist by the name ofDanny Hilman Natawidjaja took an interest in the site and assembled a team toconduct a geophysical survey using ground penetrating radar, electricalresistivity and seismic tomography. Up to this point the Indonesian scientificcommunity had arbitrarily assigned a date of 1000 BC to the rectangular court onthe summit. The assessment was based on pure guesswork. When Natawidjajaconducted the first radiocarbon tests on organic matter beneath the megaliths,the results indeed clustered around 500 to 1500 BC, so no surprises there.This all changed when the team expanded their investigation into the interior ofthe hill using tubular drills. The extracted core samples contained fragments ofworked columnar basalt, indicating that far below the summit there lay older,man-made megalithic structures. At this point the accompanying organic matterbegan to yield radiocarbon dates that were about to make the rest of thescientific community very uneasy: at a depth of 90 feet the dates quicklyclimbed from 3000 BC to 9600 BC, 11,000 BC, culminating at an uncomfortable22,000 BC. Natawidjaja’s team had successfully proved this step pyramid spannedall three Dryas periods and then some. His conclusions were affirmed by RobertSchoch — the geologist best known for dating the sphynx enclosure in Egypt tothe end of the Younger Dryas — who concurs Gunung Padang may have been in usefor as much as 24,000 years. Layer Three of the excavation was particularlyinteresting because of the extensive damage to the man-made structures at theradiocarbon date of c.9600 BC, the general period of the great flood.8Subsequent layers indicate that people survived the event and added to thestructure over millennia, just as they did at sites in Egypt, Peru, Yucatan, andGöbekli Tepe.Indeed mainstream archaeologists didn’t like any of this one bit. A very publiccampaign was quickly undertaken to discredit Natawidjaja, insisting he wasdisturbing an archaeological site without following scientific protocol (he’dstrictly adhered to protocol), and undertaking illegal digs without governmentpermission (he’d been granted permission from the President himself). Finally ina desperate attempt to stop further excavation (and limit any potentialembarrassment), they petitioned the President with the argument that the datefor the site had already been professionally established at 1000 BC so there wasno further need to explore and disturb the site. So much for the open-mindednessof science.Obviously the President saw through the rouse because, shortly after, Danny andhis team resumed excavations. The results were impressive and added to what isalready an explosive piece of evidence in support of an antediluviancivilization in Indonesia. The presence of a pyramidal structure covered bycenturies of debris is unmistakable, and buried beneath twenty feet of soil liesa large open chamber in the middle of the monument.9There is additional circumstantial support for the 9600 BC date at the site. Tothe southwest of Gunung Padang lies the coastal town of Pelabuhan Ratu (Harborof the Queen), dedicated to a mythical Queen of the Southern Ocean, a goddesswho ruled over a now submerged city.10 More tellingly on Sunda — an islandacross the Java Sea — traditions describe the great flood as submerging allmountains except Gunung Padang.11FLOORED IN OKLAHOMAOn a typical hot June day, a team of construction workers was busy digging thefoundation for a new warehouse on the Broadway Extension of 122nd Street betweenEdmond and Oklahoma City. The year was 1969. As they dug deeper into the rockshelf they finally reached the ancient limestone seabed, whereupon they noticedsomething out of character: an ancient mosaic floor covering several thousandsquare feet and containing perfectly round post-holes. Given the depth ofsediment under which it was found, the artefact could have been tens ofthousands of years old.Predictably the story generated a heated debate among experts. “I am sure thiswas man-made because the stones are placed in perfect sets of parallel lineswhich intersect to form a diamond shape, all pointing to the east,” statedDurwood Pate, an Oklahoma City geologist who studied the site. “We found postholes which measure a perfect two rods from the other two. The top of the stoneis very smooth, and if you lift one of them, you will find it is very jagged,which indicates wear on the surface. Everything is too well-placed to be anatural formation.”12The conclusion seemed reasonable. But Dr. Robert Bell, an archaeologist from theUniversity of Oklahoma, was nonplussed. To him, the find was a natural formationbecause he could see no evidence of mortar — apparently ignorant of megaliths inPeru and Egypt, all of which were built with unmatched precision without asplash of mortar. Still, at the Oklahoma site a different type of mud wasclearly distinguishable between each stone and the soil, leading a secondgeologist, Delbert Smith, to remark: “There is no question about it. It has beenlaid there, but I have no idea by whom.”13There was also the issue of the holes, which had been placed 16.5 feet apart orprecisely 6 Megalithic Yards, the unit of choice used by megalithictemple-builders around the world.14[images/00075.jpg]Mosaic floor near Oklahoma City, potentially 30,000 years old.A few days later things became more complicated when The Oklahoman continued itscoverage and reported archaeologists discovering what resembled an ancient stonehammer at the site. No further attempts on dating were made simply because theyrefused to accept anything this old could exist in this part of the world.Construction resumed unabated, the site was cleared and covered over with a foodprocessing plant. However, it would not be the only time that out-of-placeartefacts were discovered in the region. An iron pot was found embedded inside a300 million-year old lump of coal deep inside a mine in Wilburton. A miner cameupon the solid chunk and, being too large to be of practical use, broke it witha sledgehammer whereupon the iron object fell from inside, revealing animpression in the coal. The incident was witnessed by a company employee.LEVITATION IN THE LEVANTThe discoveries in Oklahoma represent the subtle presence of a remote andintelligent civilization in the central plains of North America. By contrast,what is seen throughout Palestine and the Near East can only be described asbeyond overt.Around 8000 BC humans were living in a primitive state throughout the Jordanvalley, yet in the blink of a geological eye they turned the area into anagricultural oasis, domesticated cattle, and erected megalithic structures ofpreposterous scale. We are meant to believe it was done on a whim, withoutprecedent or outside assistance, but clearly someone from elsewhere provided thenecessary expertise that led to an evolutionary revolution at places likeJericho.Arabic peoples refer to Jericho as the City of Giants.15 Recent excavations touncover the roots of this out-of-the-ordinary city exhumed the originalmegalithic foundation wall, 6.5 feet thick by 20 feet tall, l200 feet incircumference, surrounded by sensational ditches cut from bedrock, which todaywould require heavy industrial equipment.The radiocarbon dating of organic matter found at the lowest habitation levelshows people already living in the general vicinity c.9000 BC, although itdoesn’t tell us when the stones were put there. The general consensus is that noevidence exists of solid structures at Jericho between 9070 to 8030 BC, thatmegalithic construction allegedly began in earnest two hundred years later, yetthe dates were determined from habitation layers on top of the bedrock ratherthan uncontaminated organic matter taken from under or between the stones, whichwould give us a more accurate picture. What is certain is the city succumbed toa local inundation around 6540 BC.16This immediately begs the question: if the region was only populated by huntergatherers in 9000 BC, how did they come to possess the technology to move andplace such extraordinary masonry and why should they have made work so difficultfor themselves in the first place? The obvious explanation is, because thearchitects of Jericho were already technically proficient and comfortableworking on a large scale, and if indeed a race of giants lived there — even theBible categorically claims so — then assembling monoliths would have been aseasy for them as stacking bricks would be to a human bricklayer.With Göbekli Tepe barely four hundred miles to the northeast and alreadydemonstrating the presence of an advanced astronomical-architectural culture by10,000 BC, it is reasonable to speculate its architects also possessed theknow-how to build Jericho.17 So the more important question we ought to ask is,was Jericho already a work-in-progress when it was interrupted by the flood, andthe city rebuilt by survivors? After all, the enclosures at Göbekli Tepe suggestthey were sealed to protect the site from impending damage. The same architectsmay also have been responsible for the walls of the Hasmonean Tunnel, the oneattached to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Each stone block weighs around 500tons and represents some of the oldest masonry supporting the modern-day city.Perhaps. And yet all of this cyclopean building effort was a mere warm-up forthe people who erected a stone platform of supernatural proportions in thetemple city of Baalbek, three hundred miles southwest of Göbekli Tepe.The 17th century Patriarch of Lebanon claimed Baalbek was also originallypeopled with giants, and looking at the scale of the foundation stones of itstemple it is hard to disagree.18 Nothing about this enterprise is on a humanscale, and no written trace survives to explain its purpose, but what is clearis that it was built to last for eternity. Why else use such oversize andinconvenient building material?The platform in question is made up of three courses of megalithic blocks oflimestone totaling twenty feet in height. Resting above these along the northernperimeter is a row of nine huge monoliths neatly fitted without mortar, the gapbetween the stones barely perceptible; this is repeated along the southperimeter. Describing the west wall, however, requires a leap of imagination:Three stones have been raised twenty feet off the ground, each measuring 63 x 14x 12 feet on average, and weighing an estimated 880 tons. They appear stacked aseffortlessly as wooden pallets, and form a U-shaped enclosure with an openingfacing east.[images/00076.jpg]A human figure reveals the scale of the megalithic platform at Baalbek.Dedicated to the Sun god Baal, the temple is a masterpiece of construction andaesthetics. Certainly it has acted as a magnet for a plethora of cultures whooccupied the region over its long and tortured history, each adding theirpresence to the site. What is telling is how each successive course of masonryabove the megalithic platform becomes progressively smaller, weaker and poorerin craftsmanship. Apparently it wasn't only Andean stonemasons who got sloppieras centuries passed. Parts of the wall have been repaired and patched, withstones looted from other parts of the temple and adjacent sites. Finally theRomans added their own flourish, a temple dedicated to Jupiter fitted inside theU-shaped enclosure; it too is impressive in scale, least of all the fifty-fourtowering columns, of which only six now survive, ironically due to earthquakedamage, and yet the underlying platform remains as solid as the day it wasconstructed.Regional traditions describe Baalbek as having been built in three stages: theoriginal in antediluvian times; the second when Nimrod, great great grandson ofNoah, sent giants to repair the walls damaged by the great flood; and the thirdwhen it was repaired again by King Solomon.19 Certainly the contrastingconstruction methods are proof that different people from different erasrepaired, extended and juxtaposed their ideas, needs and religious beliefs rightup to the Roman era, when Baalbek was still known as an oracle featuring a\"black stone which answered questions.\"20All the above is mere foreplay for what follows.Two stones were left behind at the quarry half a mile away. The first measures71x14x14 feet and weighs 970 tons; the second measures 67x15x14 feet and weighsa slender 1242 tons. These were believed to be the largest pieces of workedmasonry in the world until a German archaeological team digging around thesecond monolith in 2014 unearthed a third block buried beneath, revealing whatis considered to be the single largest worked monolith in the world: 64x19x18feet, clocking in at a puny 1650 tons.21And just like in Göbekli Tepe, Easter Island and Ollantaytambo, something ofgrave importance forced the builders to abandon work.[images/00077.jpg]Big? Wait ‘till you see the two blocks underneath. Baalbek.Baalbek and Göbekli Tepe, along with Temple Mount and Giza, all share a numberof common features: all are built on limestone bedrock; all are designatedNavels of the Earth; all incorporate megalithic stonework. It all seems beyondmere coincidence.They also share connections to Egyptian antediluvian gods: Giza and Göbekli Tepeare domains of Osiris, while Jerusalem’s oldest known name is Gar-issa-lem, Issabeing the oldest iteration of Isis. As for their divinely conceived son, thesolar deity Horus, he may originally have been the tutelary god of Baalbek. TheCanaanites who once populated the region are known to have undertaken regularpilgrimage to Giza in veneration of the sphynx, and even as late as 1543 BC theyleft votives with carvings inscribed with its original Egyptian name,Hor-em-Akhet — Horus of the Horizon — to which they added the Cannanite variant,Hurna and Hauron.22 Being a traveling god, Horus' influence extended north ofGiza. In Jordan, the main hill at Petra is dedicated to this falcon deity, andhis cult in known to have been practiced in the port town of Ugarit, to thenorth of Baalbek.Clay tablets portray Horus as a conjurer and magician,23 he knew the medicine ofplants and once cured a man of snakebite by distilling an antidote from a tree.As the resurrected form of Osiris, Horus represents the triumph of light, anattribute shared with Baal, from whom Baalbek takes its name. But did thisantediluvian magician and his followers assist in the building of Baalbek,moving its stupendous stone blocks half a mile using some lost form oflevitation, just like the legends from Tiwanaku and the Pacific? AncientEgyptian literature describes the deeds of the magician Hor the Nubian who once\"made a vault of stone 200 cubits [300 ft] long and 50 cubits [75ft] wide riseabove the head of the pharaoh and his nobles... When the pharaoh looked up atthe sky he opened his mouth in a great cry, together with the people who were inthe court.\"24Certainly there exists a link between Baalbek and Giza. A geodetic alignment of45.1º through the corners of the two large pyramids of Khafre and Khufu extends400 miles to Baalbek, with a margin of error of just 0.4º. The reference is allthe more uncanny since the geodetic alignment through the third pyramidreferences Göbekli Tepe, as we saw earlier.[images/00078.jpg]Corner alignment through pyramids of Khafre and Khufu.It would seem the three antediluvian locations share a unified plan, if not acommon purpose, yet there is a twist with regard to the age of Baalbek itself.The site has always been associated with the cult of the Sun; if ever there wasa reference to a specific constellation or star, it is not known. Working withthis basic assumption we can roll back the sky to when, say, the winter solsticemight have aligned with the massive temple platform, which faces 75º east.In the northern hemisphere the winter solstice marks the day when the light ofrejuvenation begins to reclaim the longest nights of the year, hence thesymbolic association with the triumph of light over dark, and the heroes whopersonified this quality, gods such as Hor and Baal. Due to the effects ofprecession the Sun now rises 45º to the south of the platform. To achieve aperfect alignment between the two, one needs to go back to the era of 20,000 BC.If so, how does this tie-in with Giza?[images/00079.jpg]Baalbek aligns to the winter solstice sunrise 20,000 BC."},{"pageContent":"> 8. MADE IN EGYPT BEFORE THE FLOODWhen it comes to discussing ancient Egypt, much of the attention falls upon itsgrandiose structures, such as pyramids, simply because their superhuman scale iscandy to the eye and humans are so easily seduced by the scale of things. Yet asall Mysteries traditions teach, the eye is easily deceived by scale to thedetriment of seemingly trivial things that ultimately lead to greaterillumination.That said, it would be a travesty to describe the temple of Seti I at Abydos astrivial, for it is a beautifully preserved jewel of a sacred space. Certainlyancient people treated the location with reverence, for Abydos was already athriving city by 5400 BC,1 and two thousand years later pre-dynastic pharaohswere still building shrines, temples and mortuaries there. Seti I added his ownmasterpiece during a reign that lasted barely more than a decade in thethirteenth century BC, an elegant temple featuring a series of interconnectedhalls and side chambers, covered from floor to ceiling in exquisite friezes,murals and hieroglyphs, with a play of shadow and light that penetrates themeticulous rows of reed columns inside a hypostyle hall. Still, people had long been coming here to witness another wonder.[images/00080.jpg]A masterpiece in its own right. Seti I temple, Abydos.Twelve thousand years ago the region bore no resemblance to the partly parched,partly cultivated strip of land it is today. The climate was wetter, itsustained a verdant and lush landscape as far as the eye could see, and to thewest where now lies an endless desert, there existed an inland sea, much ofwhich drained into the Atlantic when the events that generated the great floodoverhauled the terrain. A small saltwater lake at Siwa is all that remains.Referring to an older source, Diodorus of Sicily describes how it \"disappearedfrom sight in the course of an earthquake, when those parts of it which laytoward the ocean were torn asunder,\" leaving behind the Sahara.2The course of the Nile was much different too, its shore was five miles closerto the town, its waters reaching another kind of temple, one named for theEgyptian god of resurrection Osiris — the Osirion. When it was cleared of debrisThe Times of London described it as “a gigantic construction of about 100 feetin length and 60 in width, built with the most enormous stones that may be seenin Egypt.”3 In terms of construction and style, the temple bears no resemblanceto Seti’s. It is stark yet hauntingly beautiful, one of the finest examples ofsimplicity and economy of line, expressed with heavyset blocks of red granite,one of the hardest rocks on Earth, ferried from a quarry two hundred miles away.The construction logistics pose a conundrum for any modern engineer yet theOsirion belongs to a remote age. It was created with the sole intent of defyingtime.[images/00081.jpg]When news of its excavation reached the world in 1914, the Osirion at Abydoscaused a major sensation. Equally exciting news came a century later when it wasfound to have once been a free-standing structure beside the Nile.When news of its excavation reached the world in 1914, the Osirion at Abydoscaused a major sensation. Equally exciting news came a century later when it wasfound to have once been a free-standing structure beside the Nile.The structure consists of two rows of columns connected by substantialarchitraves upon which once stood a voluminous stone roof. These are poised on araised rectangular platform surrounded by a deep moat cut into the stone; twoascending staircases lead out of the water and onto the platform, where lie twosunken rectangular pools.The surrounding courtyard itself is one massive and impenetrable wall made of25-foot thick red sandstone, fitted without mortar, with corner stones cut andangled much like they are in Cuzco. Seventeen side chambers are meticulously cutinto the wall and face the central platform.4 The plan of the courtyard bears apassing resemblance to the head of Pachacamac carved above the Sun Door atTiwanaku. It's a passing observation for sure, but the same cannot be said forthe knobs carved in relief on sections of the courtyard wall, for they are anidentical to those in Andean temples.There are no inscriptions inside the Osirion, no dedications, no name toidentify its creator, only a set of hieroglyphs carved into the wall adjoiningSeti’s temple and no doubt put there during the pharaoh’s time.Until recently the Osirion was believed to be a type of underground chamberfitted inside hollowed bedrock, an extension of Seti’s temple. If so itrepresented a complete departure from standard temple design. However, ageologic appraisal contradicts this opinion. In ancient times the level of theNile was fifty feet lower than today, its course seven miles closer to andbeside the Osirion. When North Africa was subjected to major flooding between10,500-8000 BC, layers of Nile silt gradually compacted and rose inch by inchuntil they surrounded and covered the Osirion, in other words, the temple wasoriginally a freestanding feature on the floodplain.5 Legend has it that peopleonce reached the Osirion by boat and navigated its interior by boat, an opinionexpressed by Henri Frankfort, one of the early archaeologists at Abydos,6 but asthe Nile crept ever more eastwards, it eventually became necessary to connectthe Osirion to the river with a long canal.7There is no doubt about river access. Twelve boats up to 72 feet long were foundin the vicinity, buried in the sand, each designed with rounded, phallic tips,and enclosed in individual mud brick enclosures as though the ships were somehowspecial, something worth commemorating. Like the two boats found in deep pitsbeside the Giza pyramids, these were large and graceful ocean vessels capable ofriding rough seas. The level of sophistication clearly points to people withlong sea-faring experience. But why should they be 400 miles from the ocean atAbydos? The boats were dated to around 3000 BC, too late to match them to anantediluvian race, yet wall paintings in temples along the Nile depict the sameboats c.4500 BC, so it is feasible that the seafaring tradition may date backfurther.In this regard the Osirion has two counterparts downriver at Giza — the SphynxTemple and the Valley Temple, all constructed with identical megalithic blocksof red granite (those of the Sphynx Temple were looted for building material),using the same clean, graphic layout, devoid of inscription. The Giza templestoo were reached by boat when the waters of the Nile lapped at their respectiveentrances. The intermediate walls of the Valley Temple are made from massiveblocks of limestone quarried from the sphynx enclosure next door and are clearlyeroded by water, lots of water. Since it has been convincingly argued that thesphynx itself was carved to face its counterpart in the sky, the constellationLeo, on the spring equinox c.10,400 BC, ostensibly the two sites arecontemporaries of each other.8 Furthermore, the enclosure in which this lionsits was also weathered by extensive flooding and rainfall when a pluvialclimate predominated northeast Africa, the epoch prior to 10,000 BC.9 Thus byweathering and design alone all the above temples share the same period.[images/00082.jpg]Like the Osirion, the Valley Temple at Giza is freestanding and once borderedthe Nile. Its top tier shows extensive water erosion, suggesting the area wassubmerged. The original limestone blocks were afterwards lined with graniteduring renovation.Returning to the Osirion, there is the question of why so many temples andshrines appear in its vicinity of yet none relate to it, as though it was nolonger visible by pre-dynastic times, so when pharaohs came here to mark theirdevotion they were essentially honoring the sanctity of place. By the time SetiI came to build his temple— one of the last to be erected — he may haverediscovered the Osirion because his temple follows the same orientation, butstops short of the underground structure before resuming to the left andcreating an L-shape, forcing the most holy of chapels to be placed sideways tothe body of the temple, a complete violation of temple protocol.10 The onlyrational explanation for such a drastic measure is that Seti's superimposedbuilding broke through the chamber beneath during construction.[images/00083.jpg]Could the enigmatic structure be a remnant of an antediluvian age? With itsraised platform surrounded by a water channel, the Osirion can be regarded as arecreation of the primeval island of the gods in stone, an artificialrepresentation of the original home from which the gods emerged. To determineexactly when it was built we must turn to astro-archaeology.[images/00084.jpg][images/00085.jpg]No resemblance to the temple above it. Osirion, Abydos.Time and again I have stood dumbstruck in the Osirion. Its orientation haspuzzled me for years, for it does not face the solstices or equinox, nor does itrelate to the pole star, nor any obvious object in the sky. Myth states this tobe a resting place of Osiris, even if the association, as in so many cases inthe ancient world, is metaphoric. Osiris is the classic depiction of the herowho is dismembered before ascending the Milky Way to reach the origin of souls —typically the Pole Star or the belt of Orion — and whilst in the Otherworld heis reconstituted by his consort Isis.A look at the night sky at the time of Seti I produces absolutely norelationship to any stellar object, it seems the pharaoh broke yet anotherconvention by ignoring the sky-ground dualism essential to the foundation of thetemple and its function as a mirror image of the sky, as expressed in the maximAs Above So Below. Seti was an astute student of temple protocol, he wouldn’thave made such an obvious mistake. Since his temple is aligned to the same axisat the Osirion, it follows that he may have may have attempted to revive theimportance of its predecessor.I turned my focus to Orion, the constellation with which Osiris is intimatelyassociated. Perhaps this obvious clue would yield a sky-ground relationship, butno such relationship exists, not unless the Earth was upside down 14,000 yearsago and even so it would be hard to prove.Only in the epoch of 10,000 BC do connections finally begin emerge, when theconstellation Cygnus appears in full upright ascent over the horizon inconjunction with the axis of the temple, the entrance framing its brightest starDeneb. As does the Milky Way, forming a vertical river for Cygnus to ridetowards the vault of heaven. The correlation took place on the spring equinoxc.10,500 BC, and again on the winter solstice.[images/00086.jpg]Cygnus rides the Milky Way, as viewed from the Osirion 10,500 BC. (Rear of siteshown.)By way of validation the sky goddess Nut, who is identified with the Milky Way,is painted as a naked female spread across the sky on the ceiling of theOsirion's north-eastern chamber, her legs formed by the bifurcation at Deneb inCygnus.11 The symbol couldn’t be more apt. Cygnus itself was regarded as both aswan and a kite hawk, and it is likely that Egyptian text references to the\"kite of Osiris\" may have had this constellation in mind. His bride Isis, whotook on the form of a kite hawk when resurrecting souls, is depicted withoutspread wings as a symbol of protection and to demonstrate her ability to fanthe breath of immortality into those whom she oversaw, specifically her consortOsiris.[images/00087.jpg]The canal around the platform was drained in 1918, revealing the protrudingknobs common to Andean temples.For this to occur, the soul of the hero must reside in the pole star, regardedby ancient cultures as the region of regeneration, a place in the sky protectedby seven great akus (souls), each represented by the seven circumpolar stars,Deneb being one.12 Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson explains this in context ofEgyptian ideology: \"Circumpolar stars are a very good metaphor for the afterlifebecause when viewed, they never seem to set: they simply rotate around the polestar. They are the undying stars, or in Egyptian terminology, theIndestructibles, a perfect destination for the soul.\"13 The Indestructibles orikhemu-sek (the ones not knowing destruction) was a name created by Egyptianastronomers, although the idea of these stars protecting a portal ofregeneration is shared among indigenous cultures.14 Interestingly Cygnus appearsto occupy a region in space where such regeneration might occur. Research byNASA reveals this constellation to be a source of the most energetic andpenetrating form of light — gamma rays. More to the point, it is one of ourgalaxy's richest-known stellar construction zones. In essence Cygnus is astar-forming region.15 Perhaps it is for this reason that temples of themagnitude of the Osirion are referred to as places where an individual goes tobe transformed into a god or into a bright star.Indestructible? Portal of regeneration? What apt epiteths for a temple named forthe god of rebirth and designed to outlast time! Incidentally the derivative ofaku is akh — a person filled with inner spiritual radiance, a Shining One — fromwhich is derived the term ahu, the name given to ceremonial stone platforms ofEaster Island. We have already come across groups of seven Shining Ones in theform of the Urukehu, Viracocha and the Hayhuaypanti, and the Anunaki sages.Could any of these seafaring gods have been responsible for the Osirion?Probably, based on a direct correlation between the Osirion and the position ofDeneb c.10,500 BC, when this brightest of stars not only rose along the axis ofthe temple but, due to the effects of precession, it had by then also taken upits position as one of the Indestructibles.[images/00088.jpg]Isis in her role as kite hawk.The effective pole star during the course of the Younger Dryas was Vega.16 InArabic tradition Vega is An-nasz-al-waki, the falling eagle, named after itsapparent swooping motion in the sky. Perhaps it is more than ironic that anumber of world traditions describe wise men being forewarned of the impendingdeluge by an eagle or a hawk. According to the Kamilaroi of Australia, forexample, when the deluge was caused by the eagle-hawk Pundjel, two peoplesurvived by climbing a tree. The metaphor describes how the couple savedthemselves through attachment to the World Tree representing the cosmic polelinking the three levels of creation, the knowledge of which guarantees theirsurvival as seeds of a regenerated humanity. That’s quite the symbol ofrebirth.17IWNW. ANTEDILUVIAN ABODE OF GODSSurviving the suicidal tendencies of Cairo’s drivers is one of life’s greatadventures, although it hardly compensates for the disappointment I felt whenarriving unharmed at perhaps the most overlooked temple city in Egypt, Iwnw,because nowadays it is nothing more than an unremarkable, rubbish-strewn parkhemmed in by an ever-encroaching suburb, its monuments long since scavenged forthe building of medieval Cairo. Only a colossal carved head of Thutmosis II,recently dug out of the Nile silt, and a sixty-seven foot tall obelisk ofSenusret I reveal a sliver of its former glory, for Iwnw was once the epicenterof Egypt’s gods, the root of temple and priestly culture. It housed a fabulouslibrary, thousands of years before Alexandria, and its grounds resembled aforest of obelisks. During the Ptolemaic era the Greeks renamed it Heliopolis.I couldn’t help but see the irony here. Senusret’s father was the pessimisticpharaoh Amenemhet I. And well he should have been because when Amenemhet tookcontrol of Egypt in 1990 BC he inherited a wasteland decayed by civil war.Writing to an emergency council meeting, Ipuwer, a sage at Iwnw, laments thechaos and confusion spreading through the land: \"Temples are defiled, texts aredefaced, the districts of Egypt devastated and the treasury bankrupt.\" Ipuwermakes an impassioned plea for a leader of courage to step forward, someone withthe kind of spiritual integrity as those from the Golden Era of the gods, towhich he adds the astonishing remark, “that which the pyramid concealed hasbecome empty.”18 Clearly there once existed something of supreme importanceinside the Great Pyramid which by his time had been lost, looted or hidden.Still, part of Ipuwer’s prayer was answered in the form of Senusret I, whorebuilt the by-then ruined temple academy.How did Iwnw become the foundation of Egyptian history and when might thismoment have occurred?The Egyptian Building Texts describe the abode of the original primeval gods asiw swht (Island of the Egg), and every artificial focal point constructedthereafter was regarded as its equivalent, a mirror of the original domain. Whenan environmental catastrophe initiated the start of the Younger Dryas, it partlysank the Island of the Egg, forcing the gods to search for a suitable locationwhere they could rebuild their civilization. They sailed to Egypt, found a moundsurrounded by the Nile and called it iw nw (Island of Primordial Waters).19As the effigy of the pregnant belly of creation, Iwnw — also transcribed as Annuand Awnu — was enclosed within a rectangular temple dedicated to the creator godAtum. Inside was placed an obelisk and the Temple of the Bennu, a phoenix-likeheron who impregnates the mound with a life-giving essence called hikê or heka,the closest interpretation being ‘magical power’; the final addition was apyramidal stone, benben, whose root means ‘seeding of a womb’. Taken togetherthese symbols tell the story of how an antediluvian group of gods settled hereand instigated a rebirth based on magic, which in ancient times was equated withthe control and application of the laws of nature. It marked a moment inprehistory when civilization was reborn from the waters of chaos and divineorder was reestablished following the devastation that marked the start of theYounger Dryas. Iwnw became the womb from which the whole Egyptian religious cultheralded, it was the central hub for initiates, for the study of the stars,symbolic architecture, and the sacred hieroglyphic writing unique to thisregion.This navel of the earth was said to have been established at Zep Tepi (FirstOccasion). When might this moment have occurred?Like their counterparts in the Pacific, the Urukehu, the architects of Iwnw wereexpert astronomers and voyagers, and proof of their work appears in the mannerin which subsequent temples were designed as terrestrial mirror images of starsand constellations.20 In this respect, looking at the night sky above Iwnw it ispossible to establish a founding date for this temple.As already mentioned, Egyptian architects took a specific interest in Orion,specifically its belt stars which were considered the hearth of the universe.From Iwnw it was possible to see the ridge across the Nile where the pyramidsmight be. In the epoch c.10,400 BC the pattern of Orion’s Belt seen on the‘west’ of the Milky Way matches the pattern and alignments of the three Gizapyramids, and when this pattern is observed in the east when Sirius makes itsheliacal ascent, a perfect match of this star occurs on the ground with Iwnw,thus matching the time of its construction to that of the pyramids on the springequinox.21The implication is that a group of gods settled in Egypt within a few hundredyears of the onset of the Younger Dryas to initiate the recreation of theirvanishing world, a substitute, with Iwnw as its nucleus.22 This may explain whythe region experienced an unexplainable Palaeolithic agricultural revolutionaround the same period, particularly the cultivation of barley, while ferociousfloods and other natural disasters regularly swept down the Nile Valley,recurring periodically for a further thousand years.23However, this is hardly the end of the story. The Building Texts refer toanother island of the gods, iw titi (Island of Trampling), a region occupied bysome divine beings since primeval times.24 Taking this at face value we canextrapolate that this island of titi lent its name to Lake Titicaca, amid whichlies the Island of the Sun. According to the Andean creation myth this islandrepresents the original mound emerging from the waters of chaos at the verybeginning of time — much like the description of Iwnw. In one account this isthe place from where Viracocha and his Shining Ones later emerged, at one strokefusing Egyptian and Andean narratives. The name given to Titicaca, along withits attendant temple city Tiwanaku, was a way to symbolically link these placeswith the original island of creation, thereby maintaining a tradition to thebeginning of creation itself. That iw titi, this island abode of the gods, wasprotected by a falcon deity may also be the reason why, in the Togarevantradition, titi-caca is a compound name of two totem birds.THE GIZA BLUEPRINTAn eight-mile ride southwest of Iwnw brings you to mosque Ibn Tulum, one of theoldest in Cairo, an unusual place insofar as it does not face Mecca, as mosquesare generally designed to do, but misses said holy site by a full ten degrees.Ninth century Arab architects, mathematicians and astronomers were light yearsahead of the competition, they would not have allowed such an error, unless thesite on which the mosque stands is of older provenance. Orthodox Muslimhistorians are touchy when it comes to acknowledging archaeological placespreceding Mohammed so, predictably, no information has been forthcoming on whatmight have previously stood on the site, although I predict that, in time, thelocation might come to be of enormous significance, because exactly eight milesto the east marks the middle of the three pyramids at Giza. Given ancientarchitects’ disposition to arrange sacred sites in perfect triangles, the thirdpoint, Iwnw, creates a perfect isosceles triangle. We could be looking at theoriginal geodetic blueprint mapped in this region by the gods 12,000 years ago.[images/00089.jpg]Earlier I outlined the conclusion of the research by Bauval and Gilbert datingthe Giza pyramids to 10,400 BC when their pattern matched Orion’s Belt on thatspring equinox. How might people of earlier times have interpreted such aproposition?The general view that pharaohs Sneferu, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure wereresponsible for the buildings erected between Giza and Dashur is based entirelyon circumstantial evidence, even graffiti, but most likely from taking theopinion of the Roman philosopher Pliny too literally — that pyramids were “theidle and vain ostentation of the wealth of kings” — and accepting his opinion asfact. The truth is, by the time early Greek travelers visited Egypt during thefirst millennium BC and wrote down whatever accounts they could gather, it isclear from the confusing and contradictory stories that no one by then had anyreliable idea of when the monuments were built or by whom or for what purpose.From this mass amnesia one can deduce that the pyramids were erected not inhistorical times but during a prehistoric age, without discounting thepossibility that the original structures were expanded upon at a later date.Much to the consternation of Egyptologists, the closest anyone has come todating the pyramids is Amenhotep II, who ruled around 1427 BC. If the star shafttheory proposed by Bauval and Gilbert is correct — that the internal shafts ofthe Great Pyramid align to Sirius, Ursa Minor, Thuban and Orion c.2450 BC, andthus provide an additional reference date for the building 25— then it isextraordinary how within a relatively short span of 1100 years even this pharaohdid not attribute the pyramids to Khufu, Khafre or Menkaure. When Amenhotepbuilt a small temple on the north side of the sphynx enclosure he placed in it alimestone stela bearing the inscription, “the Pyramids of Hor-em-akhet” (Horusof the Horizon) yet ignores their alleged architects; instead Amenhotep’s poeticepithet refers only to the earliest name by which the sphynx and its environswere known,26 implying that, by his time, the sphynx and the pyramids wereaccepted as an essential whole and shared the same time frame. Since the sphynxis dated to c.10,400 BC, by implication so too are the pyramids.[images/00090.jpg]Giza-Orion correlation 10,400 BC (after Bauval and Gilbert).Support for this idea comes from the Inventory Stela rediscovered in thenineteenth century by archaeologist Auguste Mariette among the rubble of theWadi Maghara. It was an explosive find, least of all because it stronglysuggests the Great Pyramid, the sphynx and other structures in their orbit werealready present long before pharaoh Khufu’s reign c.2500 BC, with one pyramidbeing the abode of Isis. It states: “Khufu... found the house of Isis, Mistressof the Pyramid, beside the house of the Sphynx... on the northwest of the houseof Osiris, Lord of Rostau. He built his pyramid beside the temple of thisgoddess, and he built a pyramid for the king’s daughter.”27 The Inventory Stelaappears to be a copy of an earlier original. It goes on to declare how Khufufound the temple of Isis in a ruinous state and “he built her temple again.”28The same stela also states that the Valley Temple, attributed to Khafre, wasbuilt before his reign, in fact, it was considered extremely ancient even in thetime of his predecessor, believed instead to have been the work of the godsduring the First Occasion, when they arrived from afar to settle in this region.It was called the House of Osiris, Lord of Rostau, the ancient name given to theGiza Plateau.29The Westcar Papyrus of c.1650 BC is likewise a replica of a far older document.It references an Inventory Building located in Iwnw where the wisdom of ages wasmaintained and promulgated. The papyrus mentions a chest of flint stored in aroom containing “the number of secret chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth.”30These documents were obviously of considerable importance because pharaoh Khufuspent considerable effort in the third millennium BC searching for them,possibly to assist him completing or restoring the pyramid to which his name hasbeen attached and incorrectly so, because many remote sources claim the Gizabuilding project was begun by someone else in prehistoric times. AncientEgyptians and Arab historians such as Ibn Wasuff Shah and Ibn Abd Alhokmbelieved the pyramids were built by an antediluvian pharaoh by the name ofSaurid ibn Salhouk following a prophetic vision in which the whole Earth wasturned over, its inhabitants lying upon their faces as stars fell down, strikingone another with a terrible din. He saw six massive chunks of rock falling toEarth, snatching up people and crushing them between two great mountains whosedebris blotted out the sky. Awaked with great fear, Saurid assembled one hundredand thirty high priests from the provinces and related his vision. The prieststook the altitude of the stars and made their prognostication: a deluge would beoverwhelming the Earth. “Will it come to our country?” asked the pharaoh. \"Yes,\"they answered, \"and Egypt will be destroyed.\" Since the cataclysm was stillthree hundred years in the future, Saurid commanded that pyramids ought to bebuilt.31 Coincidentally, the same time frame for the impending catastrophe wasgiven by seven beings to Enoch the scribe.Books in possession of Coptic Christians stated how at one time there existed astela at Giza bearing the inscription, “I, Saurid, built the Pyramids in suchand such a time, and finished them in six years. He that comes after me and sayshe is equal to me, let him destroy them in six hundred years; and yet it isknown that it is easier to pluck down than to build. 32As to the date of construction, the historian Abu Zeyd el Balkhy once providedan ancient inscription that the Great Pyramid was built when the constellationLyra was in Cancer, or more to the point, when its brightest star Vega was thepole star. This would have been the era of 12,000 BC. It was still consideredthe de facto pole star when the astrological Age of Cancer took place somewherearound the end of the ninth millennium, and while the latter cannot bepin-pointed with great certainty due to the discrepancies in calendricalsystems, it still places the date of construction around the general epoch ofthe great flood.Chief among the gathered astronomer priests was the god of wisdom Twt — Djehuti,or Thoth to the Greeks — who, upon observing the position of the stars and theimpending catastrophe, set about creating an unbreakable repository inside whichevery book related to knowledge would be preserved from ruin by the impendingcosmic collision, reportedly a wealth of knowledge on astronomy, geometry,physics, the use of precious stones, even certain types of machinery.Did ancient writers believe the Great Pyramid to be this repository? Hundreds ofstudies prove beyond doubt that when one dissects the numbers hand-wired intothe Great Pyramid a wealth of mathematical information is revealed concerningthe measure of the Earth, the sky, even the cycle of Sirius. Early Arabchroniclers add to this list a history of past events and of those yet to come.Commenting in the 12th century, the Iraqi physician Abdul Latif remarked of theGreat Pyramid: “The stones were inscribed with ancient characters, nowunintelligible. I never met with a person in all Egypt who understood them. Theinscriptions are so numerous that copies of those alone which may be seen uponthe surface of the two pyramids would occupy above six thousand pages.”33In a manner of speaking, the great pyramid was an antediluvian book in itself.SERAPEUM. A NO BULL TEMPLEBut I wonder, did Twt have another building in mind, less conspicuous than apyramid, resembling more a storage room or vault? Eight miles southeast of Gizathere exists such a place, an anomalous underground cavern by the name ofSerapeum. Although situated in the vicinity of the temple complex of Saqqara,the Serapeum lies well outside the temple boundary. It is a lone wolf, ameandering repository of tunnels and side chambers uncharacteristically hackedout of solid bedrock with total absence of finesse. Nestled tight inside eachchamber sits a basalt or black granite box of preposterous size, twenty-four intotal, all meticulously shaped — although machined would be a more suitableadjective, the tolerances are engineered to perfection — each topped with athirty ton lid, too unnecessary to cover a corpse, but perfectly designed toform an air- or watertight seal.Each box weighs up to eighty tons and is believed to have been a sarcophagus foraurochs, the enormous bulls representing the sacred hjpw or Apis. There’s justone problem with this theory: no bulls were ever found inside the boxes or nearthe Serapeum, and if grave robbers stole the bones, no evidence exists of thereever having been a black market for auroch bones. Even if we accept thispreposterous idea, one still needs to explain why it was necessary to carve suchcumbersome boxes for these animals when smaller ones would have sufficed.When Auguste Mariette rediscovered the Serapeum in 1850 it only contained onehuman burial, that of Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II; all other boxes wereempty except — suspiciously — one lone bone from a bull. A few bore markings andhieroglyphs. I’ve examined them up close, and it amazes me how no one isbothered by the rough quality of the scribbles, for that’s what they look likein comparison to the refined craftsmanship of the granite boxes. The hieroglyphsare crude, etched using a blunt instrument, as though thousands of yearsseparate the boxes from the inscriptions — as though the fine art of stoneengraving had been lost by the time Khaemweset was interred in 1213 BC.Interestingly, this pharaoh was a restorer of historical buildings, tombs andtemples. Might he have rediscovered and reused the Serapeum?[images/00091.jpg]Tourists visiting the Serapeum in 1882, long before the age of pesky vendors.Since there is no evidence to prove it was originally intended as a tomb, I wishto propose an outlandish hypothesis: someone working against the clock hastilycarved the tunnels and filled them with these air-tight boxes to protectsomething of far greater importance, such as Twt’s documents, from the cascadeof water about to descend upon Egypt, then returned after the event, retrievedthe contents and took them elsewhere. Of course, the obvious problem is, how doyou locate an underground repository in a landscape transfigured beyondrecognition by a global flood?[images/00092.jpg][images/00093.jpg]One of the colossal granite boxes in the Serapeum. Below: Compared to the boxes’precision tooling, the etched decoration is of very poor quality.Being expert astronomers, the Egyptians were aware of what was about to descendupon them, they would have prepared accordingly. If the Giza pyramids were beingerected at this time, two advantages present themselves: first, they weatheredthe cataclysm; and second, they would have made reliable landmarks. Let’s sayyou were an astronomer on the high ground at Giza — marked by Menkaure's Pyramid— after the flood in, say, 9650 BC. Standing in front of the pyramid andlooking at the southern sky around midnight on the winter solstice you wouldhave observed the Southern Cross standing upright at 143º and right above theSerapeum, like an X marking the spot. Five hours later, just before sunrise, youwould have noted the bright star Ankaa rising with its parent constellationabove the same location; the name in Arabic means phoenix, and indeed belongs tothe constellation of a bird. The symbolism of the retrieval of valuableknowledge and its rise from the ashes of catastrophe would not have not beenlost on people for whom the employment of multiple layers of symbolism was aneveryday practice.But to find any location it is necessary to triangulate by establishing threepoints of reference.The Serapeum's original entrance tunnel is curiously aligned 100º east andmisses the equinox by a long shot. Nothing in temple design was done byaccident, so the entrance must be referencing something else. At this latitudein the era of 9650 BC it marked the winter solstice sunrise, but whateverterrestrial backsight was used for this alignment is lost, buried, or mostlikely looted for building material.Which leaves the third point of reference. Like the Giza pyramids, those atDashur and Meidun to the south are attributed to Sneferu c.2600 BC, but whyshould one pharaoh have required so many mausoleums when he only possessed onebody? All the evidence linking Sneferu to this complex is a nearby graffitiwritten 1200 years after his reign, in which it is stated how the temples“belong to Sneferu,” nothing more.34 The statement does not claim the pharaohbuilt them, merely that he owned them, much like a monarch might own severalcathedrals in his kingdom despite the buildings having been in existencecenturies before his time.[images/00094.jpg]Locating the Serapeum in 9650 BC.The Bent Pyramid of Dashur has always been my personal favorite. Up close it hasa certain aesthetic quality, in spite of archaeologists believing its two slopesare the result of a mistake. Isolated from Giza it tends to attract fewvisitors, making every visit personal. Like its neighbors to the north, the BentPyramid was not placed where it is by accident. According to Bauval andGilbert's theory it too forms an integral part of the Orion-Giza matrixestablished in 10,400 BC and, together with the nearby Red Pyramid, marks theterrestrial counterpart of the Hyades cluster.35Like its peers, the Bent Pyramid is aligned to Grid North, making its apex anideal marker of the celestial pole. Another observer standing at the base andlooking north on the winter solstice in 9650 BC would have observed Vega, thenearest to a pole star in that era, appearing at 0º and right above the Serapeumat the same time the Southern Cross was referenced from Giza. The third point.A GAME OF NUMBERSIt would seem that a number of structures in and around the Giza Plateau wereplanned as part of an antediluvian blueprint, and whoever set it up wasconversant with celestial mechanics, not to mention molecular structures,because the Bent Pyramid is not the result of miscalculation. A trigonometricformula applied to its two unusual slopes reveals angles common to the hexagonand pentagon36 — 6:5 numerically — thus the Bent Pyramid, like Puma Punkubefore, reflects the numerical relationship of the Earth’s precessional cycle.Such temples are analogs of their host planet. Incidentally, human DNA isconstructed from alternating six-sided and five-sided crystalline bonds, makingus a mirror image of our own celestial sphere.It wasn’t just the architects in Egypt and the Andes that deduced and appliedthis know-how. The 6:5 ratio is also hardwired into the perimeter of the centraltemple complex at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, whose structures also depict on theground the constellation Draco as it appeared in the sky in 10,400 BC.37 If thisis mere coincidence then consider how Angkor is a corruption of Ankh Hor, anEgyptian phrase meaning Life Eternal of Horus, and that the latitudinal distancebetween the Bent Pyramid and Angkor is precisely 72º, the root number of theEarth’s precessional cycle.38It seems we keep bumping into the same architects reading from the same manualno matter where in the world we touch a stone.Speaking of which, take the smallest of the three Giza pyramids, the one thatgets the least attention. Look carefully at the original granite casing stonesalong the base and you'll notice they are covered with the same protruding knobscommon to Saqsayhuaman in Peru, whose name means Place of the Satisfied Falcon.Consider also how the Viracochas' nickname, Shining Ones, have antediluviantheir counterparts in Egypt, the Aku Shemsu Hor, which translates as ShiningOnes, Followers of Horus. It seems the same gods were present on differentcontinents before and after the flood.[images/00095.jpg]Just like Puma Punku and the Bent Pyramid at Dashur, the Cambodian temple ofAngkor Wat is based on the 6:5 ratio."},{"pageContent":"> 9. THE ITZA, THE KAAN AND THE BALAM\"Crocodilo! Crocodilo!\" the pilot shouted enthusiastically as he steered themotorized canoe closer to the riverbank. Typically when one is within sight of atwenty-foot reptile with gaping jaws, the sensible thing is to turn the outboardmotor in the opposite direction. But Juan Carlos was keen to get me as close tothe crocodilo as possible. I believe it was a matter of pride.We disembarked sensibly a few hundred yards further downstream and onto themud-laden shore. A short, young woman greeted us and offered a very favorablerate of exchange for gringo money. Further up the bank we came to theimmigration point, a wooden shack with multiple layers of bright paint, alldifferent colors, all in various stages of decomposition. A turkey calmlystrolled out. Beside the shack, another woman vigorously washed clothes in alarge metal bowl. An old Toyota truck rolled up and the rear hatch flipped open,revealing a wide assortment of everything one could need for the jungle home:washing powder, razors, stockings, an assortment of packaged food, and thatsymbol of western economic prosperity, Coca Cola. A dozen women of various agesand walking ability materialized from nowhere as though by teleportation,surrounded the truck and pointed at things inside.\"You show passport now, señor.\"This was immigration control Guatemala style. It was simple and honest, mypreferred method of travel.With evidence already procured from around the Pacific, the Near East, Egypt andthe Andes validating the existence of a group of antediluvian individualspossessing extraordinary skills, I wanted to focus on how Central Americanindigenous people viewed the flood and from where they believe their ancestorgods might have heralded, particularly with regard to the writings of Plato. InTimaeus the Greek scholar outlines the tragic sinking of Atlantis as part oraltradition, part allegory. Most historians dismiss Plato's account as purefiction, partly because they cannot stomach the idea of an advanced civilizationexisting prior to the twenty-first century, and mostly because they do notunderstand the mechanics of myth and its ability to convey important informationto audiences then and now.Plato acknowledged his source to be Solon, a scholar and lawgiver who traveledthe Nile delta and there learned of the story of a sunken antediluviancivilization from the temple priests at Sais. Solon originally wrote down hisaccount for Socrates’ great-grandfather: \"I, Solon, was never in my life sosurprised as when I went to Egypt for instruction in my youth, and there, in thetemple of Sais, saw an aged priest who told me of the island of Atlantis, whichwas sunk in the sea thousands of years ago… the people were friendly and goodand well-affectioned towards all. But as time went on they grew less so, andthey did not obey the laws, so that they offended heaven. In a single day andnight the island disappeared and sank beneath the sea; and this is why the seain that region grew so impassable and impenetrable, because there is a quantityof shallow mud in the way, and this was caused by the sinking of a single vastisland. This is the tale which the old Egyptian priest told to me.\"1The Egyptians confided in Solon that, prior to a global flood nine thousandyears before his time — marking the event around 9600 BC — the Atlantean empireexisted beyond the mouth of the Mediterranean, stretched into southern Europeand Egypt, and records of said civilization still existed when the Greek scholarlived in Egypt.One pearl of wisdom imparted by the priests to Solon concerns an occasion deepin prehistory when the Earth rotated backwards, which led to an Ice Age: \"I meanthe change in the rising and the setting of the Sun and the other heavenlybodies, how in those times they used to set in the quarter where they now rise,and used to rise where they now set.... At certain periods [the Earth] revolvesin the reverse direction...of all the changes which take place in the heavens,this reversal is the greatest and most complete.\"2Enough ink has been poured on the subject of Atlantis to fill an entirecontinent — an incomplete catalogue of literature lists 1700 titles, and thatwas back in 1929 3 — so I feel it unnecessary to regurgitate Plato's well-knownstory. Suffice it to say the Egyptian priests acquainted Solon with the historyof the world as it really is rather than how academics prefer to interpret it.They had kept meticulous records extending deep into prehistory — the King Listin the Turin Papyrus alone spans 36,000 years — not for the sake ofrecord-keeping per se but as a warning to future generations not to becomplacent about the world they live in, to realize that cataclysms are cyclicaland bound to come around and undermine the ill-prepared. The achievements andpitfalls of their predecessors became the guideposts for future generations.I wondered what the Guatemalans might have to say on the matter.The people generally associated with this region — which includes the Yucatanpeninsula — are the K'iche' and the Maya. When gold-hungry Conquistadoresarrived in the sixteenth century they were astonished to find sprawling templecities complete with astronomical towers. Everywhere they plundered they saw apeople obsessed with the mapping of the sky and the charting of extraordinaryspans of time. For example, the Maya employed a number of calendars for trackingthe synodic cycle of Venus, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, along with the cyclicphenomena of eclipses, solstices, and equinoxes. There was a cycle related tothe 266-day female gestation cycle, a general 365-day solar cycle, and a 52-yearcalendar round when the same beginning point in the previous two calendarscoincided. Each one interlocks at critical points, demonstrating theinterrelationship of the cosmos. Supplemental calendars included a 819-daycount, the multiplication of sacred numbers 7, 9 and 13, a 584-day Venus transitthat aligns with the Earth and Sun, and Great Cycles comprising 2160 years. Suchcalculations could only come from incredibly long periods of observation,therefore the Maya or their progenitors must be incalculably old.The Maya also had absolute knowledge of thirteen dimensions or states ofconsciousness, and on one level, the development of such intricate calendars wasdue to this intimate experience, all of which defined their existence on thismaterial plane.4By contrast, the arriving Spanish still believed the Earth to be at the centerof a solar system around which rotated the Sun, and thus got by from day to daywith a simple solar calendar. Maya cosmology must have reeked of witchcraft.Even to the modern mind their vast astral knowledge seems otherworldly,excessive, unwarranted.Or is it? Another example is the Maya long count calendar that spans 26,000years and comes with markers. One marker, the Third World, began c.9600 BC, theperiod of the great flood; another began around 3113 BC when the maize Goddirected a group of other gods to set the Universe to order once again, usheringthe Fourth World (coincidentally the same period when the first pharaoh ofpurely human blood is said to have ascended the throne in Egypt). That Worldreached its apex in 2012 AD and humanity would have a window of thirty yearseither side to adapt to the changes marking the transit to the next World.5One point of view concerning the origin of the word maya is that it derives froma star in the Pleiades seen at its heliacal rising over Yucatan c.3113 BC,heralding the era of the people who took on this collective name.6 Maya, likeMaori or Waitaha, refers not so much to genetics or race but to a way ofthinking, it is an overarching principle defining a group of people. Accordingto my good friend, the Maya teacher Miguel Angel Vergara, maya refers to aperson who has raised their consciousness through the understanding andapplication of sacred knowledge, it is an allegory, a statement of spiritualconsciousness. One is not born maya, one becomes maya. Such a title is adoptedas a collective noun when a group of people share the same spiritual ideal oraspiration.7 This explains why elders claim the roots of Maya to be much, mucholder, and the people from whom they descend had different names which reflectedthe period or World in which they existed.In one flood myth the K'iche' are said to have migrated from stepping stone tostepping stone in the eastern ocean before arriving in Yucatan.8 It is their wayof describing an island-hopping voyage in search of a new domicile after beingdisplaced from their original land by the flood. Traveling inland from theYucatan coast, they eventually settled in the highlands of Guatemala and namedtheir main temple city Utatlán, which came under the protection of aregenerating god by the name Q'uq'umatz. Its remains are located barely fifteenmiles north of Lake Atitlán, the largest in Central America, beneath whosewaters lies the original city, having itself fallen prey to another naturaldisaster.The largest Maya groups still live in this region — Tzutuhiles, Cakchiqueles,Vukumag, and of course the K'iche' — all descendents of an island nation thatsank in the Atlantic 11,000 years ago, a place they call Atitlán (or itsregional variants Aztalan, Tollan, Tulanzuh). Ascribing the name to the lake andits temple city was a way to keep the memory alive.9[images/00096.jpg]Tikal’s Temple V. It’s unusual slope angle is also used in the Great Pyramid ofGiza.There's a strange fatalism involved in making a hazardous journey from a sunkenvolcanic landmass in the Atlantic only to settle beside a lake resembling aninland ocean in a region crowded with volatile volcanoes! The rest of thehistory of Lake Atitlán is shrouded in total secrecy, mostly due to the distrustof outsiders, and with good reason, as recent history attests. The Spanishpriests who sailed across the Atlantic with Conquistadores butchered everyone inCentral America who did not conform to the Catholic opinion of the world. Beforethey finished their genocide, along with the wanton burning of volumes oftechnical, spiritual, scientific and historical literature, they extricated afew codices from the Maya. Yet those accounts are but mere tourist guidescompared to the knowledge hidden beneath the floors of ordinary Maya homes —which the Spanish were unlikely to search — or better still, held safely inmemory by shamans who escaped into the dense jungle of the interior. Today ifone wishes to understand Maya prehistory one ought to consult such individuals,for they recall a very different series of events concerning their roots.After the flood a company of survivors arrived on the northern shores of Yucatanby boat and kept moving inland through the near-flat peninsula and away fromwater. After what they'd experienced, even I would have been compelled to makefor high ground through mosquito and snake and crocodilo-infested jungle just tofeel a sense of safety — much in the way the people of the high Andes did whenthey felt compelled to place their temple cities in truly awkward locations.10Those individuals were contemporaries of the K'iche', magician-priests who choseto ride out the tempest and reach survivors in different parts of the world tore-establish the wisdom and the laws upon which new civilizations would bebuilt. With this aim in mind they established the foundation of temple citiesthroughout Central America.One such formidable complex is Tikal, of which only an estimated ten per centhas been exhumed from the jungle. The wisdom keepers I befriended are unanimousabout the true origin of such places, indicating the buildings are far olderthan conventionally dated, for what is seen now is but one of many skins of anonion. Indeed just about every pyramid in Central America is built in thismanner, accommodating the needs and dictums of each successive age and expandingin kind. The pyramid of the magician at Uxmal, for example, is in fact fivepyramids encasing a sacred cave. Since neither the stars nor the Earth arefixed, every few thousand years the temple must be realigned to reflect the sky,thus temples were treated like living beings; the Egyptians went so far as toaddress each room before dawn as though rousing a person from slumber.Local wisdom keepers state that, outwardly, the current temples date from c.1300BC, but their foundation is closer to 8000 BC. Over such a long period they haveabsorbed influences from the Atlantic (Egyptian, Middle Eastern) as well as thePacific (Asian, Indonesian). Indeed, walking around parts of Uxmal and Tikal onewould be mistaken for being in Cambodia or Java or Egypt.On my first journey to Tikal I felt comfortable there. It is a universityreflecting the architecture of the cosmos, a ceremonial centre where the ancientMaya teachers captured sounds from other realities. Tikal is home to the tallestMaya pyramids, and both pyramids and temples reflect the understanding ofmathematics, geometry and cosmic calendars. They also act as needles, capturingthe telluric energy of the Earth and sky, acupuncturing the ground, and thebody. Miguel Angel Vergara has spent a considerable part of his lifereassembling and studying the full Popol Vuh and adds the following: \"Tikal wasonce home to the Architects of the Sky, who came from the stars and spokeHe-Suyua-Thau [the language of light], heralding an era when the city fusedscience, art, philosophy and religion as one.\"11[images/00097.jpg]Tikal’s main plaza. There may be up to nine underground levels.Architects of the Sky who spoke the language of light? That paints quite apicture. I wonder which part of the sky they came from?My walk around the sprawling site led to the pyramid poetically catalogued asTemple IV, the largest by bulk. The rectangular chamber on its summit generatesa most unusual acoustic phenomenon. Stand outside on the staircase with yourback to the chamber and make a note with your voice. The sound accelerates inthe chamber behind you and projects outwards and over the jungle canopy.[images/00098.jpg]Pyramid of the Magician, Uxmal. Actually five buildings in one.Another stroll through the forest, this time along the southern rim of theexcavated area, brings you to the often-overlooked Temple V, an imposing pyramidfeaturing a broad staircase, in my opinion the most potent of all buildings atTikal. Its awkwardly steep slope of 26º is the same angle employed in the stairpassage of the Grand Gallery inside the Great Pyramid of Giza — yet anotherremote relationship. After a couple of hours of solitude away from the incessantcacophony of howler monkeys mischievously wandering the tree canopy above, Iwandered over to the main plaza and was joined by Miguel and a K'iche'archaeologist. While Miguel prepared a ceremony to honor the ancestors, I talkedto my group about the nine underground layers of construction running beneaththe main plaza connecting its two iconic pyramids. I described how the tunnelswould have been used particularly by initiates as part of the Mysteriesteachings, and how they spent a few days in splendid isolation inside cavesconcealed within the core of the pyramids before appearing triumphantly at dawnon the summit to observe the rising of Venus, the mark of the risen initiate.When I finished this spontaneous monologue I looked around to find a lot ofstunned faces, particularly that of the archaeologist, who asked me, \"How do youknow of such things?\"I replied, \"Someone here just showed me, a spirit form, perhaps the templeitself is speaking to me, I don't even know if this is true, someone just fed meimages and took me to parts of the site no one gets to see.\"The archaeologist confirmed all I had said was true. The information hasremained confidential because sensitive work is still in progress. Archaeologyis a conservative profession, after all. And yes, so far they have discoveredfive underground levels below the plaza and its pyramids; the rest are inunstable condition due to their remote age, and it is speculated there could beas many as nine levels, a symbolic number in K'iche' Maya tradition.\"What brings you here aside from Tikal?\" asked the archaeologist.\"I'm looking for missing people and missing lands.\"\"You need to go to Lake Peten Itzá and the city of Flores, my friend.\"As it turns out, that was precisely where I was staying that night.HOME OF THE MAGICIANSFlores is one of those delightful, rambling old towns where every humble home ispainted in joyful colors as though someone accidentally dropped LSD into thepaint bucket. It once formed the hub for temple cities such as Tikal and Ixlu;many more are known to be hiding in the jungle or beneath deep layers ofdirt. Recent discoveries using ground-penetrating radar (LIDAR) include apreviously undetected city of 60,000 structures, including plazas and pyramids,capable of supporting some 10 million people.12Flores covers an entire island on Lake Peten Itzá. It is a recent name given bythe Spanish to what used to be the religious axis mundi of a priestly castecalled the Itz or Itzá, the last of the Maya to hold out against the invadersuntil the city was overrun and razed in 1697. The Spanish referred to it asTayasal, a corruption of Ta Itzá (Place of the Itzá). Yet the Itzá precede thatperiod, they are far older than the Maya, they are the ancestors of the Maya.This was precisely what I had been looking for.The Itzá called the island Nojpetén (Great Island), except it is not a greatisland at all. One can comfortably walk from one end to the other in twentyminutes. Its greatness comes from its status as a major spiritual center thatonce comprised twenty-one temples and a nine-tiered pyramid. The entire islandwas a temple under the care of the Itzá, accessed only by those who practicedspiritual purity or went there to learn the Mysteries teachings. It was a landset aside from the ordinary world, a primordial mound like Iwnw in Egypt or theIsland of the Sun in Lake Titicaca.Aside from a couple of stela now adorning the town square you wouldn't know itwas ever so. What gives away its ancient sacred status is the cathedral on theisland's highest point, most likely the site of the original pyramid, whosestones were plundered to build the town. The cathedral is not aligned east — aviolation of standard Catholic protocol — but rather to the winter solsticesunrise in the era of 7600 BC, when the Sun would have appeared in clear viewdown the neck of Lake Peten Itzá, thus explaining why the Itzá chose this islandover a much larger one nearby and named it Great Island.[images/00099.jpg]A stela in Flores town square, the only clue this was once a main Itzáreligious center.The other reason was emotional. Nojpetén was chosen to reflect the originalgreat island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that was once the Itzá homelanduntil the flood consumed it. The sacred book Chilam Balam (From the Mouth of theJaguar Wizard), compiled in the 18th century, actually dates the appearance ofthe Itzá in Central America: “13 times 400 times, and 15 times 400, plus 400years, the Itzá lived as heretics.”13 That's a total of 11,600 years since theirarrival after \"the water swallowed the fount of wisdom,\"14 dating their arrivalfrom Atitlán to c. 9600 BC — confirming the date originally given to Solon bythe Egyptians, as published by Plato.(Incidentally the original definition of heretic is 'someone in possession ofthe facts who is able to choose', referring to a well-informed individual,specifically in matters pertaining to sacred or restricted knowledge).[images/00100.jpg]The Itzá named this land Ma'ya'ab (Land of the Few), and in time established thefoundations of the temples and pyramids we know today — an estimated 30,000 ofthem, the most popular being Chichen Itzá — all of which are recognized by theMaya as astral academies incorporating the teachings brought to this land by apriestly caste. Itzá literally means sorcerer, magician, it is they who arereferred to as Lords or Architects of the Sky. They took their name from thegod-man Itzamna, a renowned master astronomer, mathematician, and teacher of thelaws that underpin a civilized society. Itzamna is depicted on a stela arrivingon a raft from the east, surrounded by toppling temples and active volcanoes. Hesettled in the town of Itzamel before initiating the construction of ChichenItzá. Ironically the stela was removed from Tikal and taken to Europe,ostensibly for protection, only to be destroyed during an air raid in World WarII. Another mural, this time in the Temple of the Jaguar at Chichen Itzá,depicts him as tall, slim, bearded, with large eyes and an olden complexion, andmore to the point, with facial features that look decidedly Caucasian. Perhapsthe most poignant image of Itzamna is the one painted on a large mural inside asubterranean chamber on the periphery of the central plaza of Tikal.[images/00101.jpg]Itzamna paddles to Yucatan after the sinking of Atitlán.But Itzamna's background now takes a fascinating left turn. His name is anamalgamation of Izanami and Izanagi, the husband-wife, brother-sister creatorgods who appear in Japanese mythology c.8000 BC; the same relationship isattributed to the antediluvian gods of China, Nu Kwa and Fu Hsi. How thisgod-man arrived from Atitlán only to become etymologically linked to the FarEast is confusing at best, except there may exist a bridge between these twodisparate trains of thought. Miguel Angel Vergara makes it clear that two groupsof sages arrived in Central America after the flood: the Itzá of Atitlán, whowere represented by the totem Kan/Chan, the serpent, while another, the Olmec,claimed origin from Mu'ul in the Pacific and came under the totem of Balam, thejaguar.15Itzamna also shares an interesting history with the god-man K’uKuulKaan whosimilarly appears dressed in a long tunic after the flood, from a land lost tothe sea to the east. K’uKuulKaan was not so much a given name but the spiritualideal this individual represented. His cult was based on nonviolence, compassionand humility. It was also obsessed with the mystery of immortality. The peopleof Yucatan and Guatemala were under no illusion about the physical nature ofthis god, for they describe him as \"fair and ruddy-complexioned with a longbeard... a mysterious white man with strong body, broad forehead, large eyes...who came from across the ocean in a boat that moved by itself without paddles.\"He was also described as such by the Olmec, to whom he was known asQuetzalcoatl.[images/00102.jpg]Pyramid of K’uKuulKaan, Chichen Itzá.There is no doubt the incoming Itzá set out to recreate the world they once knewand lost. Only an advanced culture with thousands of years of accumulatedscience and engineering know-how could have created temple cities such as Copan,Tikal, Chichen Itzá, Palenque, Uxmal, and El Mirador, the largest civic andpyramid complex in the Americas, the product of a fully developed culture. Aswith other parts of the ancient world the best architecture is found at thelowest layer, its megalithic engineering eclipsing all subsequent construction.Chichen Itzá, in particular, was a kind of cosmic university to which candidateswould flock from all over central America to be educated to the highest levelsof mathematics, astrology, astronomy, science, philosophy and the Mysteries,each discipline taught in individual temples, many of which embodied theteachings by mere virtue of measures and decorations hard-wired into the fabricof the buildings. Candidates became masters of the arts and carried the titleAh-Kan-Bezah (Those Who Teach The Path to Wisdom).16Geological evidence shows that the Yucatan Peninsula has been habituallydestroyed by rampaging tsunamis as tall as fifty feet, necessitating rebuildingprograms on a regular basis. This alone accounts for the many layers of styleand building design. The central administrative structures of Palenque, forexample, exhibit at least four different building periods founded on a lowerlayer of megalithic stones that are clearly the product of an earliercivilization.Museums are filled with statues and stela bearing the telltale signs ofsaltwater erosion from sites deep inland. Everywhere lie buildings half coveredwith layer upon layer of silt, and yet all rivers throughout the Yucatan areunderground, so where did so much silt come from? Recent excavations around theperimeter of the Pyramid of K’uKuulKaan in Chichen Itzá reveals a further twolayers of beautifully fitted stone concourses now lying twenty five feet belowthe present ground level, validating traditions that it was designed long, longago by the astronomer priest Nohoch-Itz-Tzaab (Great Face of the Rattlesnake),and expanded accordingly from period to period.17 Like the moai on EasterIsland, such extreme silting can only come from thousands of years ofaccumulated debris, from recurring periods of civilization, destruction,fallowness and rebirth. Archaeologists such as Augustus Le Plongeon, who cameacross such temples covered in dense jungle in the 1890s, remarked on theamounts of river rock and sediment deep inside the buildings, not to mentionhalf-buried buildings, attesting to many violent episodes. The temple of Sayil,some 100 miles from the ocean, appears to have undergone a horrific tsunamiwhich pounded the buildings with such force that great numbers of buildingblocks have been widely scattered to a point where reconstruction has provedimpossible.[images/00103.jpg]Exposed lower level reveals the pyramid’s older layer.Could this be evidence of mega floods and extreme weather that followed the endof the Younger Dryas? One piece of evidence concerns the sacbe, the spirit roadsthat stretch across the Yucatan in ruler straight alignments like umbilicalcords linking temple cities to each other. They are identical in character andpurpose to the tracks fanning out from Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, or theruler-straight roads criss-crossing the British Isles from tip to toe that evenin 2000 BC were already described by the Welsh as old beyond memory. Suchengineering marvels, ten to twenty-five feet in width, hundreds of miles inlength, were built well enough to require little or no maintenance orimprovement. They too were constructed from a long accumulation of gatheredexperience.[images/00104.jpg]The historic temple façade, made from small limestone blocks, rests on a courseof older megaliths. Palenque.Thanks to satellite imagery it is now possible to see where the sacbe run intothe Gulf of Mexico and continue some thirty feet beneath the present sea levelbefore rejoining land and continuing to the next temple city.18 At the veryleast this places their construction before 3000 BC, when the last major sealevel rise took place.Or do such anomalies belong to an earlier epoch? Recent discoveries of 358submerged cave systems covering nine hundred miles near the temple of Tulumreveals humans were present in the Yucatan earlier than accepted. One recoveredhuman skull was covered in deposits from c.7000 BC. Inside this limestonelabyrinth world resembling the arteries of a giant, divers found the remains ofenormous sloths, proto-elephants, extinct fauna and, more to the point, Mayaartefacts, all deep underwater, trapped by rising water levels between8000-10,000 years ago, creating a time capsule that places the predecessors ofthe Maya firmly in this region in the era after the flood.19[images/00105.jpg]K’uKuulKaan set the example of ideal conduct that later humans aspired tofollow.

An account of the twelve days spent there was written by amissionary aboard the ship, Father Santa Clara, who describes the islands asmoderately elevated, about twenty miles in circumference, well wooded andabounding with coconuts. Several small islands lay to the west, with a boatchannel in-between providing good harbor. The abundant fur seals on the beachwere so tame they would not move out of the way of a landing party searching forfood.Before stocking the ship with five thousand coconuts, two hundred and fiftybread-fruits, four hundred land terrapins and twenty-five green turtles, it wasnoted how a volcano was ablaze on each of the nine islands. Which might explainwhy, when Captain Benjamin Morrell sailed there in 1824 all he found afterforty-six days of surveillance was discolored water to a depth of 720 feet.2Geologists generally scorn the idea of landmasses disappearing in the blink ofan eye, and yet, much to their vexation, suddenly vanishing landmasses are aregular occurrence, even in historical times. Take the case of a Polynesiansailor living on Tuanaki island, part of the Cook group, in 1842. When amissionary vessel was sent to rescue him two years later, Tuanaki and two otherislands had disappeared, the result of a violent earthquake.Or Davis Island, discovered in 1687, five hundred miles west of South America at27º south, added to naval charts because it was a huge landmass stretchingbeyond the horizon. Thirty-five years later captain Jacob Roggeveen went lookingfor it on his way to Australia but it was no longer above sea level. Still, thejourney was not a loss for the Dutchman, for he stumbled upon Easter Island byaccident; two islands in the vicinity were put on naval maps as late as 1912only to vanish in the proceeding years, including Sarah Ann Island in 1932,which failed to be found after a fruitless three-week search by the U.S. Navy.Chroniclers in the fifth century BC were no strangers to such phenomena.Herodotus noted on his travels that all the land in Egypt south of Menfer andall the way to the highlands of Ethiopia had once been covered by the sea, aswere the desert plains of Arabia, corroborating the earlier account fromTeotokai Andrew of an island inhabited by the Anunaki having existed in thatregion during the Younger Dryas.The historian Pliny likewise was aware of the cutting off of landmasses byrising sea levels, such as Britain from France, and Sicily from Italy. He tooreferenced a large continent that once was in the middle of the Atlantic,adding, “in our Mediterranean Sea, all men may see at this day how much has beenimmersed: Acarnania by the inward Gulf of Ambracia; Achaia within that ofCorinth... And besides, the Sea has broken through Leucas, Antirrhium,Hellespont, and the two Bosphori.”3 Back in the day the process of geologicrenewal was accepted as sudden and catastrophic, such as the total collapse ofmountains and hills like Cybotus and Phogium in Ethiopia.4 As recently as 646 ADa violent earthquake in Chile levelled several mountains, while an entireprovince in China was swallowed up and replaced by a lake in 1556.5 And had youbeen near the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island in 2016 you would haveseen ten feet of sea floor rise out of the ocean following an earthquake thatlasted a mere two minutes.With missing lands comes the prospect of lost civilizations and the two gohand-in-hand. A 1966 oceanographic investigation of the Pacific Ocean discovered\"two upright columns, about two feet or more in diameter, sighted extending fivefeet out of the mud. Two more had fallen down and were partially buried, andanother angular square-ish block was seen.\"6 The official report added that oneof the columns bore markings resembling inscriptions. The odd thing was, theworked columns were now at a depth of 6000 feet and fifty-five miles off thecoast of Peru.7 During the Younger Dryas that coastline would have seen the sea600 feet lower than it is today,8 still not enough to explain how five man-madeobjects found their way to the ocean floor. Or perhaps the Andean flood accountsof mountains rising and falling rapidly are not as far fetched as they sound.What is certain is that 11,000 years ago an unnamed stone mason living in theSicilian Channel between Sicily and Tunisia cut a 39-foot long, 15-ton limestonemonolith, drilled holes into its surface, and transported it 1000 feet to whereit was placed upright. In a part of the world where such menhirs arecommonplace, it was surprising to find this particular example at a depth of 131feet below the Mediterranean Sea. The monolith was dated to c.9300 BC based onattached shell fragments, thus it had to have been carved and transported longbefore being engulfed by encroaching waters. And there's no mistaking its humanorigins: it has a regular shape and three drilled holes of similar diameter on ablock of non-local limestone.9Pliny and others, it seems, were absolutely right about the rapid re-shaping ofthe landscape, particularly the sudden inundation of the Mediterranean.A MALTESE ENIGMAPrior to the events of 9700 BC the Mediterranean Sea was much shallower,peppered with archipelagos and landmasses of considerable size that becamesolitary islands after the drastic rise in sea level at the end of the YoungerDryas, so it is reasonable to ask if we are missing an entire antediluvianmegalithic culture whose survivors found themselves scrambling for higherground. Part of the answer lies in and around the Maltese archipelago, whichformed part of Sicily before rising seas transformed it into four islands.[images/00106.jpg]Filfa island seen from the megalithic temple of Hagar Qim. The land bridgeconnecting it to Malta collapsed in a major catastrophe.A few years ago I had the opportunity to visit the temples on those sun-kissedislands. Their cloverleaf and womb-shaped internal chambers are unique, as aretheir adjacent underground temples — hypogea — with whom they form a symbioticimage of the universe, the light above and the dark below. They certainly givethe impression of having developed in isolation, the product of a society thatwished to remain separate.One of the oldest temples, Ggantija (Tower of the Giantess), stands on thesmaller island of Gozo. It is officially dated to c.3600 BC, based on fragmentsof debris taken from one of the chambers after the site was cleared duringexcavations around 1904, casting doubt on the quality of undisturbed organicmaterial. And since the analysis was made long before the availability ofradiocarbon testing, the dating appears to be nothing more than an educatedguess, to shoehorn it into the academically acceptable timeframe. In 1934 thearchaeologist Luigi Ugolini speculated that the lowest habitation layer ofanother Maltese temple, Tarxien, was closer to 8000 BC.10 It requires no effortto image how this news was received.[images/00107.jpg]Ggantija’s unusual double axis, one for the Sun, the other for the Moon. Bottom:its lower, older wall is better constructed, and better preserved.Just like temples in the Andes, Ggantija's oldest stones are also its largest.The original lower courses were cut from hard globigerina limestone and weighsixty tons apiece and, as one would expect on a small island, they show signs ofwater erosion. The upper courses are newer, made with smaller, less refinedmasonry and of a construction aesthetic sufficiently mismatched to suggest alater reconstruction, like an apprentice electrician returning to finish thework of a master carpenter. They are also in a comparatively advanced state oferosion, even the undersides, suggesting they were once scattered on the ground,then reused for reconstruction. The thing is, Malta’s regional climate is arid,and has been progressively so for 8000 years.11On the main island, the above is repeated at the temple of Hagar Qim. A numberof building periods featuring differing skill levels have been at work here. Theolder the stones, the better the skill, but unlike Ggantija, the lower coursesof Hagar Qim show extreme weathering to the point of crumbling, as one wouldexpect from limestone closer to the sea and exposed to the elements for a vastlength of time. A second period of construction repaired sections of theoriginal temple using blocks of more manageable size and lacking the samefinesse, again adding height to the original walls; insensitive twentiethcentury restoration has left predictably appalling results.Once again the condition of the stone becomes the focal point. If the templesare less than six thousand years old, where did the water come from to producesuch an advanced level of erosion, because it's been nine thousand years sinceMalta last experienced the type of sustained precipitation required to createthe kind of erosion borne by its temples.Since the region shares the same climatic footprint as North Africa, it ispossible to travel to Giza and observe the same effects on its oldest temples.One of my favorite places to demonstrate the effects of large-scale watererosion is the rectangular temple situated behind the small pyramid credited toMenkaure. In addition to a crowd-free environment, you will be rewarded with acourtyard and avenue composed of massive blocks of limestone, whose uppercourses show exactly the same level of water erosion found at Ggantija, HagarQim, Mnajdra, and every other Maltese site. A careful examination of thispyramid temple also reveals blocks taken from other sites used to patch andrepair, after it too incurred heavy damage from an unknown event. If the GizaPlateau was last exposed to profoundly wet climate between 10,500-8000 BC, itfollows that the same climate was responsible for weathering the temples onMalta.The Maltese temples may be vestiges of a lost antediluvian civilization, giventhat a number of sites that once stood on dry land now lie two miles offshoreand under twenty-five feet of seawater. One prehistoric temple constructed from\"rectangular blocks of unbelievable size\" now lies at the bottom of Vallettaharbor, still seen in 1536 stretching a considerable distance out to sea.12 Ggantija itself is a temple of advanced design yet there is no evidence ofits gradual development. The temple arrives perfect, on an island too small toaccommodate the kind of urban population and architectural civilization requiredto pull off such an engineering marvel.13 But what if Ggantija was once part ofa megalithic culture when Malta suffered a calamity of such magnitude italtered the region beyond imagination and wiped out its ancients architects,leaving the temples to decompose, before the gods returned under more favourableconditions to engage in rebuilding the island’s temple culture? Evidence showsthat parts of Malta have been overwhelmed by tidal waves that swept across theisland due to collapsing land bridges, violently stuffing animals, people andartefacts into caves. Figurines of the Earth Mother, carved in a stylecontemporary with Mediterranean and Near East art between 7000-14,000 BC, werefound among accumulated flood debris. Like Jericho, Malta appears to have beenat the mercy of unstable climatic conditions following the end of the YoungerDryas, particularly from melting glaciers and collapsing ice dams still coveringnorthern Europe, frequently releasing trillions of gallons of meltwater thatrushed into the Mediterranean.Let us assume Ggantija — and Malta's other twenty-seven known sites for thatmatter — belongs to a remote age, say, 14,000 years ago, not a far-fetched ideaconsidering the aforementioned shell-encrusted megalith found at the bottom ofthe sea lies to the northwest of the island. So let's play with this epoch.Ggantija has two entrances whose axes are slightly misaligned as though trackingtwo related yet separate objects above the horizon. Due to the effect ofprecession, the Sun has crept steadily northwards with each passing millennia.By c.12,000 BC it rose in alignment with the upper entrance of Ggantija on thespring equinox, casting a ray of light onto an alcove at the rear of the temple.At this same time, the lower entrance marked the Major Lunar Standstill, thepoint when the Moon’s orbit reaches its southernmost position. Both entrancesface a hill across the valley whose summit was entirely levelled to achieve theeffect.[images/00108.jpg][images/00109.jpg]Ggantija’s unusual double axis, one for the Sun, the other for the Moon.Such a remote date is more consistent with weathering on Ggantija’s oldermegaliths, in fact it subjects the temple to not one but two cataclysms — thestart and end of the Younger Dryas — inflicting the kind of heavy damage thatreturning architects would have needed to address. Assuming they repaired thesite by 9000 BC, it still left two thousand years of rainy weather to accountfor the erosion now seen on the upper layers of Malta’s monuments.A CLIFFHANGER OF A DAYSetting aside the enigma of the Maltese temples for a day, I made a point ofexamining another of the islands’ curiosities — parallel ruts incised deep intothe limestone bedrock, resembling tracks made by the repeated passage of wheels,except the evidence points to the ruts having been bevelled and cut out of thebedrock with tools.14 No sensible explanation has been forthcoming as to howthey got there or why. The ruts cross the island and often stop at significantmegalithic structures; some are interrupted by 3000-year old Punic graves, so atleast it is certain they predate this period. Whether they are a clue as to howthe limestone blocks were ferried to the temples is a matter of speculation.The ruts on the north side of Malta cut through towns and gardens, run to thewater's edge and continue unobstructed for a considerable distance under thesea. It is true that the north side of the island is sinking, yet the rate atwhich it is doing so cannot explain the depth to which the ruts descend belowsea level; it can be argued that a combination of slippage plus a rise in sealevel c.3000 BC is to blame, making the them only five to six thousand yearsold.The same cannot be said for the south coast, which, for the most part, is one600-foot vertical cliff. It was quite an experience to follow the ruts througharid scrub, right up to the cliff edge, and pick up the trail underwater,evidence of how the southern section of the island dramatic collapsed. Thehistorian Louis De Boisgelin visited Malta in the late 18th century andcommented on this: \"The ruts may be perceived underwater at a great distance,and to a great depth, indeed as far as the eye can possibly distinguish anythingthrough the waves.\"15It appears the island was subjected to a substantial impact that caused enoughpressure to split the bedrock along a fault called the Pantalleria Rift. Unlikethe northern coast that slopes gently into the water, the southern coast bordersa deep canyon which in 16,000 BC was already filling with seawater, with thecoastline still a considerable distance from Malta. It took a stupendous rise insea level at the end of the Younger Dryas for the Mediterranean to finally reachpresent-day Malta, a process that concluded by 7000 BC. The question thatremains is what might have caused the cliffs to collapse in the first place?[images/00110.jpg]Hagar Qim and its various, and progressively smaller stages of construction.One candidate is a massive wall of ocean water that rammed through the deep,narrow canyon then separating Morocco and Gibraltar — as ancient writers claim —inundating the Mediterranean basin, collapsing land bridges, and turninglandmasses into islands. This was also the opinion of De Boisgelin: \"A varietyof phenomena prove that there must have been a great extent of land towards thesouth and west [of Malta], and that it must have been destroyed by some veryviolent cause out of the common course of nature. It appears that thisdestructive shock came from the west, and that it acted with the greatestforce... we can only attribute the present state of things to an immense body ofwater... it also destroyed that part of the mountain which united the threeislands, and this inundation has stripped them of all vegetable earth.\"16[images/00111.jpg]The enigmatic ‘cart ruts’ of Malta.And as far as the tracks at the edge of the cliffs are concerned, \"thiscircumstance gives every reason to suppose that the ground must have sunk veryconsiderably in this spot.\"17A sudden subsidence of land was most certainly the case because the ruts alongthe top of the southern cliffs continue underwater for three miles and reappearalong the top of the tiny island of Filfla, 500 feet above the sea, still seenthere by visitors in 1911.A THOUSAND MISSING HEADSI need little excuse to spend time in medieval Valletta, a limestone city ofsteps worn smooth by the feet of the Knights of Malta, numerous Arab traders,ancient Phoenician voyagers, and the odd pirate or two. When opposing culturescollide, like asteroids, the result is often messy, but here they blend into awarm, romantic and sensual urban paradise.After the obligatory two-hour outdoor lunch, I made my way to the Museum ofArchaeology to get a sense of who the megalithic builders might have been andwhen they might have lived. Two carved limestone slabs grace the entrance hall,removed from the temple of Tarxien for their own protection. Visitors walk by,pose for selfies, and move on, oblivious to an extraordinary connection. Thefour spirals on each slab reflect the essence of life: the solstices, theequinox, and a central circle referencing the force holding this recurringrhythm of life in perpetual balance. The first time I saw the panels they had afamiliarity about them. Indeed I had seen them before, in the museum at Tiwanakuand, except for a slight artistic difference, they may as well have been carvedby the same ancient artist.It is by no means the only link between Malta and the Andes. In 1902, workersdigging a cistern accidentally broke through the ceiling of a well-preservedsubterranean ritual temple that became known as the Hypogeum of Hal Salflieni.Sometime in the distant past the bedrock was hollowed into thirty-threecontiguous halls and chambers on three floors with a footprint of a quarter of asquare mile, and may have served as the underground component of the nearbytemple of Tarxien.Like many of its kind, the Hypogeum was intended as a place of ritual, anenvironment where one can connect with another level of reality, and recentacoustic research proves it was deliberately tuned to a resonant frequency knownto shut down mental processing in the brain and induce altered states, afrequency similarly detected in the Kings Chamber of the Great Pyramid.18 Redocher paintings were daubed on several walls, one featuring a bull reminiscentof Palaeolithic cave art from 8000-30,000 BC. But something less artistic layconcealed in layers of dirt: over seven thousand human remains violently mixedwith those of animals and sundry debris as though dumped into the caverns by awall of water. What made the find significant were the hundreds of skeletonswith elongated skulls identical to those in Paracas, on the coast of Peru.[images/00112.jpg]Inundation map of the Mediterranean around Malta.Back at the museum, I'd arranged to meet with the director to see thesedolichocephalic skulls. I had been forewarned by my colleague, the investigativejournalist Graham Hancock, to expect a less-than-warm reception when inquiringabout matters of discomfort to archaeologists. He'd been there earlier only tofind that, of the hundreds of unusual skulls removed from the Hypogeum, only sixcould be accounted for. Even so, Hancock still had to press the staff to showhim the paltry collection.19I was to be presented with even fewer: none. In fact the director palmed me offwith a box of typical Homo sapiens skulls while stating there never was evidenceof dolichocephalic skulls found in Malta.There was no avoiding the drop in barometric pressure in the room. I pressedthat the skulls are a matter of record rather than a figment of imagination.20And in case such a trap popped up, I presented photographs that Graham had lentme from his visit which clearly show said skulls — held by a member of her staffno less — including that of an adult's with a missing fossa median, a seamcommon in human skulls that allows the plates to expand during childbirth. Weare definitely looking at a very different species of person living on Malta — awhole tribe, according to the original find — and given the outlandishconcentration of temples on such a small piece of land, they may have formed areclusive culture, a special society set apart from ordinary humans, preciselyas I've speculated all along with regard to the antediluvian gods.At this point in my brief meeting, the director of the Museum of Archaeology ofMalta left the room and my visit was terminated.The abrupt shutting down of uncomfortable evidence follows the topic of ancientcivilizations wherever one travels, whether it's the archaeological cabal ofIndonesia seeking to discredit Danny Hilman Natawidjaja at Gunung Padang, orGraham Hancock and myself in Malta — or another fellow by the name of Silva wholives on the remote Atlantic archipelago.THE UNDERWATER MOUNT THAT IS A PYRAMIDWhile on my way to Portugal to research potential antediluvian sites, I landedon the island of São Miguel in the Açores to stretch my legs and work my waythrough a plate of pasteis de nata, those addictive little custard pastries. Anarticle in the morning newspaper announced an exceptional discovery proving theAçores was indeed the location of the lost continent of Atlantis. Sometimes theuniverse has impeccable timing.Diocleciano Silva is a veterinarian by day and a sport fisherman by the weekend.He was on his boat casing the fertile fishing banks between the islands of SãoMiguel and Terceira when his sonar picked up something that ought not be there:a 180-foot tall, perfectly square structure with several diminishing levels,oriented to the cardinal points — a step pyramid, larger than a football stadiumand, according to the bathymetric reading, 120 feet below sea level. A longexperience of the sea had given Diocleciano many surprises but none quite likethis.[images/00113.jpg]Sonar image of underwater pyramid.This was not entirely fresh news. Mr. Silva had made the discovery eight monthsearlier but hesitated to divulge it. Given the ferocity of personal attacks andslander by the academic mafia that follow such explosive discoveries, I can’tblame him, and yet, just for a change, the discrediting on this occasion camefrom the Portuguese Navy, who claimed the lucky fisherman found nothing moreanomalous than an underwater sea mount, one of many in the region. How the oceanis capable of sculpting such a perfect structure, they could not explain. Norcould they explain why the pyramid they claim to be a mount lies in a totallydifferent location to the GPS coordinates provided by Diocleciano.Unperturbed, the Commander of the Açores Maritime Zone insisted the GPS readingwas an error. One wonders, given such shoddy equipment, how Diocleciano hasmanaged to sail to and fro for years in the middle of the ocean and still returnhome safely each time! Nevertheless the Portuguese Navy quickly dismissed thefind as a natural feature on the basis of older charts of their own while neverinvestigating the specified site.The alleged pyramid appears on the slope of a large submarine volcano that makesup much of the João de Castro sea bank, a treacherous area filled with perilousundersea volcanoes. One eruption sank two ships in 1718 before building up to acircular island one mile long and eight hundred feet high. Ravaged by theAtlantic Ocean, the island finally disappeared within four years. Strong seismicactivity afflicts this region and the entire archipelago, it is a highlyvolatile part of the Earth's crust, the kind of place where a landmass couldquickly and violently vanish. Still, marine life loves it here and it has beenan important fishing ground for centuries, perhaps longer.Eight years after the discovery nothing has moved forward. Or has it? In my book The Divine Blueprint I presented a hypothesis thatmany of the world's oldest sacred sites were placed on a grid. Most might haveeven been in place before the flood. By extraordinary coincidence Graham Hancockfound the same grid using a different computation.To paraphrase the hypothesis, if an ancient civilization wished to build templesas markers around the world they would have based the plan on a mathematical orgeometric grid reflecting the host planet. The ancients recognized the Earth asa living organism, and living organisms are formed on cellular bonds usingpentagonal geometry. The base angle of the pentagram is 72º; its divisors are18, 36, 54, 108, 144. If one locates a declared Navel of the Earth, such as Iwnwin Egypt, and converts those numerical values to longitudes, the vertical lineshit notable sacred places with remarkable accuracy. Graham's version uses thenumbers inherent in the Earth's processional cycle, whose main divisor is 72.Predictably, we reached similar conclusions albeit independently.Incidentally, the same series of numbers are hard-wired in the fabric andfeatures of major temples, sacred texts and myths.One of the things that vexed me during this research was the lack oflongitudinal markers in the Atlantic. Not surprisingly I was excited byDiocleciano's discovery, even if it came after the book went to press. I stillhad to wait a couple of weeks before returning home to locate his underwaterpyramid on my map, and as much as I would have loved a happy ending, Silva'sdiscovery is 3.5º west of the mark, close but not close enough. I suspectDiocleciano was given a taste of things to come, and should an underwater searchbe conducted slightly to the east it might yet yield something more provocative.11,000 years ago all this would have been another matter. Even discounting amajor subsidence in the mid-Atlantic Ridge due to damage from comet impacts andrising sea levels, the Açores still formed a formidable island chain. In 1963the Russian physicist Dr. Maria Klionova recovered rocks sixty miles north ofthe Açores at a depth of 6600 feet bearing signs of exposure to oxygen c.15,000BC, while sediment taken from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge revealed the remains offreshwater plants as well as beach sand created along an ancient shoreline. Evenrainwater was found trapped in fossils and limestone deposits. These areindications that this part of the Atlantic was above sea level just before theonset of the Oldest Dryas. A similar situation was observed in 1898 by the crewof a ship laying underwater cable in the archipelago. As grappling hooks scrapedthe ocean bottom two miles below, they turned up unfamiliar particles of lavawhose peculiar glassy structure could only have solidified in the open air.21Plenty of discussion has taken place since Plato's time establishing this as themost likely area of Atitlán/Atlantis so I need not revisit this scenario. Whatis worth pointing out is that, in myths, Atitlán is said to have collapsed inthree stages, in conjunction with the three Dryas events that took place over a3000-year period. It is therefore feasible that in 13,000 BC the archipelagostill formed a considerable landmass, and bathometric maps of the region offer aglimpse of the roughly triangular format of the original island continent, justas depicted on ancient maps.[images/00114.jpg]Bathometric map of the Açores reveals a shape not unlike that of Atlantis inmedieval maps. X marks the underwater pyramid.Coincidentally, Plato's dialogue in Critias describes a sunken Atlantis much inthe same way navigators in the Pacific did when looking for other missing landsin the 19th century, \"...when afterward sunk by an earthquake, became animpassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of theocean.”22Underwater pyramid aside, there exist 140 step pyramids on the island of Picoitself, built with small basalt stones locally referred to as biscuits. Theyreach up to forty feet in height, contain hidden chambers, many of which areastronomically aligned.23 Deposits of ancient artefacts unearthed byarchaeologists Nuno Ribeiro and Anabela Joãquinito point to the structures beingmuch older than the accepted date of the discovery of the Açores by thePortuguese in 1427. In Nuno's words: “We have found a rock art site withrepresentations we believe can be dated back to the Bronze Age... we have anepigraph from Roman times, according to two scientists who were invited tointerpret the inscription... megalithic structures, and an important set ofstructures scattered throughout the islands that need to be interpreted in newways.”24 Phoenician coins from the 2nd century BC have also been discovered onthe adjacent island of Corvo.25As exciting as these discoveries are, none of the above are proof of remoteantiquity, they merely show that life continued to thrive in the middle of theAtlantic in spite of unimaginable forces that once afflicted the region. Theferocity of seismic events past and present preclude that little if anyconclusive evidence of Atitlán may ever be found. Yet, like sonar images, thereare other signs pointing to an antediluvian presence in the Açores: a series ofcart ruts on the island of Terceira that, like those on Malta and Easter Island,run to the edge of cliffs and into the sea.A KIND OF CUBAN REVOLUTIONIf parts of the Açores dropped two miles to the bottom of the Atlantic, and fivemegaliths stand 6000 feet off the coast of Peru, then a submerged city at 2300feet should be relatively easy to explain.\"It is stunning. What we see in our high-resolution sonar images are clearman-made, large-size architectural designs. It looks like when you fly over anurban development in a plane and you see highways, tunnels and buildings,\"announced offshore engineer Paulina Zelitsky who, with her husband PaulWeinzweig and their son Ernesto, discovered megaliths \"of a kind you'd find atStonehenge or Easter Island... Some structures within the complex may be as longas 400 metres wide and as high as 40 metres... They show very distinct shapesand symmetrical designs of a non-natural kind. We've shown them to scientists inCuba, the U.S. and elsewhere, and nobody has suggested they are natural.\"26The team had originally been scheduled to locate shipwrecks off Cuba's westerncoast, where hundreds of vessels are believed to have sunk over the centuries,but they became understandably sidetracked. And who can blame them. Thestructures they stumbled upon while scanning the seabed with side-scan sonar andvideotape equipment bear a remarkable resemblance to Mayan pyramids in nearbyYucatan. Invited scientists saw what appear to be streets, bays and structuressimilar to wharves in a port.27 Stone blocks up to fifteen feet long, cut inperpendicular and circular shapes, were recovered from the ocean floor. \"Thestone is very polished granite. All of this peninsula is limestone, veryfractured limestone. So, geologically, it [megalithic granite blocks] is totallyforeign to Cuba. But it's also not known in Yucatan because Yucatan is alsolimestone, not granite.\"28 An anthropologist at the Cuban Academy of Sciencesanalyzed stills taken from the videotape and claimed some of the stones appearto contain symbols and inscriptions.29Like Malta, this submerged metropolis lies on what used to be a land bridgeconnecting the island with Yucatan, a plateau adjacent to a deep fault line.30Vestiges of the site might still exist above water because, three decadesearlier, archaeologists excavated a megalithic structure along Cuba’s westernshore, a few miles from the underwater discovery.The geologist affiliated with the underwater project, Manuel Iturralde, made avaluable observation: the volcanic glass covering the ocean floor could onlyhave been formed on the surface while it was in contact with oxygen, suggestingthe land upon which the city once stood must have been above water, and the lasttime a shift in both sea level and seismic activity of such magnitude took placein the region was around 11,000 years ago. A secondary indication that a severecataclysm collapsed the entire surface lies in stones extracted from the oceanfloor that show concentrations of fossilized escaramujos, a crustacean thatlives at a depth of only six feet.31\"You would not think that a reasonable woman of my age would fall for an idealike this,\"32 Zelitsky remarked, yet the team returned to reconnoiter the sitewith a remotely operated vehicle controlled from the mother ship via fibre-opticcable. Its cameras confirmed the earlier findings, including vast granite-likeblocks between six and fifteen feet that were cut in perpendicular and circulardesigns.33Amid the piles of sonar-enhanced maps spread over Zelitky's desk lay a well-worncopy of Comentarios Reales de las Incas, the account of Inka and pre-Inkahistory by Garcilaso de la Vega, the same tome that describes the great flood inthe Andes and the arrival of Viracocha and his seven Shining Ones. Zelitsky wasparticularly fascinated by the account of ancient ruins at the bottom of LakeTiticaca — which have since been confirmed — and the sense of irony theypresent.34Predictably, like other discoveries that would alter the history ofcivilization, this story has been buried very deep ever since.VENICE OF THE PACIFICTemptation draws me magnetically back to the Pacific. No other place on Earthreflects such an absence of terrain, only the outstretched tips of drowned landsand submerged volcanoes peek above water like lips daring to be heard. Aspaceman could look at the Pacific Rim — the most volcanically active region onEarth — and recognize, with detachment, how this ring of fire exists due to animpact of such magnitude it dislodged a roughly elliptical section of theEarth's crust.One of the first Europeans to search the Pacific in the 16th century, thePortuguese navigator Pedro de Quierós, proposed the theory that its islands werethe remains of a now submerged continent, a view accepted by his peers at thetime. It may not be the most scientific hypothesis but it is nevertheless anaccurate observation based on folklore collected directly from island people bysuch explorers. Soviet scientist V.V. Belousov discovered that in the recentgeologic period, and certainly during the age of Homo sapiens, \"the Pacificocean grew considerably at the expense of great chunks of continents which,together with their young ranges of mountains, were inundated by it. The summitsof these mountains are to be seen in the island garlands of East Asia.\" Hisfindings were supported by another scientist, George H. Cronwell, in a paperdelivered to the Tenth World Pacific Congress, in which he reported thediscovery of such anomalies as coal on Rapa Island, irrefutably proving thatthere once existed a continent in that part of the Pacific.35As we have already seen, many islands such as Tahiti retain standing stones,moai, ahu and other fragments of a lost megalithic culture. Others like Pohnpeitried to rebuild in the image of what once was. Unique to Pohnpei (Upon a StoneAltar) is the ka tree, an odd choice of name because it is the Egyptian word forsoul. Even more unique is a roughly pentagonal temple city by the name of NanMadol, consisting of a group of small artificial islands linked by a network ofcanals. Its core features some one hundred artificial islets contained within amile-long perimeter wall, up to thirty feet high, built in alternating layers oflarge columnar basalt blocks and infill, all of which had to be laboriouslytransported from the opposite side of the island.[images/00115.jpg]A window on Nan Madol. Thousands of basalt columns larger than these were movedfrom the other side of the island to build an entire city.Pohnpeians originally called this enchanted citadel Soun Nan-leng (Reef ofHeaven). According to legend it was created by the sorcerers Olisihpa andOlosohpa upon arriving from a sunken land to the west called Kanamwayso, andindeed the remains of another citadel have been located offshore at a depth ofninety feet. The two brothers sought a place to build Soun Nan-leng in honor ofNahnisohn Sahpw, god of agriculture, whereupon they performed rituals andlevitated the huge stones with the aid of a flying dragon.[images/00116.jpg]Sections of Nan Madol still above sea level.There’s a resemblance here to the exposed structures made from columnar basaltatop Gunung Padang on the island of Java, but what is really striking about thisout-of-place megalithic wonder is that it was designed to form a restrictedsanctuary, it was designed to be separate from the island, much like a sacredenclosure, as though its inhabitants wished to create an isolated society. Likethe long heads of Malta, these people were different, particularly the twobrothers who were said to be much taller than the natives.TAIWAN AND TULAN, PLACES OF REEDSThe Taiwanese flood myth describes how the giant snake Bonum blocked the flow ofrivers until the entire world was submerged except the highest peak, TongkuSaveq (Mountain of Shelter). Two people were forewarned by gods to listen to agreat change in the sound of the sea at the time of the full moon, whereuponthey were to make haste for the mountain. There they received refugees from asunken land called Tulan, from which Taiwan takes its name.36Tulan or Tolan, if we recall, is the name given by the K'iche' Maya to a missinghomeland, the Place of Reeds.Below the mountain lies Sao Pa and its large concentration of megaliths,twenty-one feet tall by a few inches slim, not unlike the proportions of thestone pillars of Göbekli Tepe, and Stennis, a stone circle on the remotenorthern Scottish island of Orkney. And just as Stennis was designed by peoplewith a keen knowledge of astronomy, so the site at Sao Pa was carefully chosento mark the Tropic of Cancer where, on the summer solstice, an upright stonecasts no shadow.Geodetically, Sao Pa also sits precisely 90º east of Giza.[images/00117.jpg]Menhirs at Sao Pa, below the Mountain of Shelter.One of the flat-faced megaliths was taken to the Taiwan Museum. It features apair of large cubes carved in relief. Anyone who’s climbed to either Naupa Huacaor the Moon Temple of Wayna Picchu in Peru will recognize the same designprotruding from their respective centerpiece megaliths. Again we must ask, isthis evidence of a group of astronomer architects from the same academyregrouping and rebuilding after the flood, and if so, what evidence remains oftheir previous work?[images/00118.jpg]Megalith at Sao Pa. Same knobs as in the Osirion, Menkaure’s Pyramid, and Andeantemples.The answer may lie seventy miles east of Taiwan and eighty feet below sea level,on the island of Yonaguni. The megaliths of Sao Pa mark the Tropic of Cancer inthe present era, but had they been erected ten thousand years earlier they wouldhave missed the mark by one degree of latitude, an unacceptable margin of errorto any self-respecting architect of the sky.37 Back then the slow-movingimaginary line of the tropic would instead have passed through Yonaguni and itssubmerged citadel, a vast ledge of shaped steps, roads, passages, platforms andpillars, some astronomically oriented. To quote the geologist Robert Schoch:“Since Yonaguni is close to the most northerly position the tropic reaches inits lengthy cycle, the island may have been the site of an astronomicallyaligned shrine.”38Prior to the flood this hand-carved mesa would have resembled a kind ofceremonial island, its shape reminiscent of carved bedrock outcrops foundthroughout Peru called intihuatana, whose angles are designed to marksignificant solar, lunar and stellar events. Yonaguni may have been a largerversion. A model of the entire mesa, based on measurements and photos taken overthe years by divers, even resembles the enigmatic carved boulders scatteredthroughout Peru, with their steps, staircases and ledges leading nowhere.The parallels abound and astound.[images/00119.jpg]Those mysterious knobs, this time on the altar stone of Naupa Iglesia. Peru.THE LAND OF THE RED HILLA rapidly encroaching ocean lost India a considerable amount of dry land, andtoday several cities lie far out to sea beneath the murky, sediment-laden watersof the Indian Ocean, one of the most evocative being Mahabalipuram, the City ofBali the Giant.39 But the greatest loss to the flood was the land to the southof India which once connected today's island of Sri Lanka to the mainland. Theregion was called Kumari Kandam.The focal point of this ancient land of the Dravidian culture is Arunachela, theRed Hill, a Navel of the Earth where the laws and knowledge of the gods weredeposited as an insurance policy against any further infringements of the sea.\"Oceans will not submerge it, even at the time of the great deluge.\"40 Theextreme antiquity of Arunachela may well be correct because the Dravidianlanguage alone is more than 10,000 years old.41The Red Hill takes center stage in the most ancient Tamil literature, theTolkappiyam, itself based on an earlier work, which in turn was part of alibrary of truly ancient texts going back a further 10,000 years. These werehoused in the First Sangam (academy), a city of knowledge founded at Tenmaduraiduring the age of gods by no less a figure than Siva himself.42 Thisantediluvian academy was composed of 549 members, among them the sageAgattiyanar, the hill god Murugan, Kubera the Lord of Treasure, and patronizedby eighty-nine kings over an unbroken period of 4440 years before being consumedby a major transgression of the ocean.43The survivors moved north and established the Second Sangam at Kapatapuram,which persevered for a further 3700 years until it too was consumed by the sea,along with the rest of Kumari Kamdan. One survivor, a Tamil prince namedThirumaaran, managed to rescue literary classics such as the Tolkappiyam andswam with them to Uttara Madurai, closer to continental India, establishingthere a Third Sangam which continued for 1850 years.44 Alas it too was inundatedand now sits at the bottom of the Indian Ocean to the south of present-dayMadurai, a city that remains a place of great scholarship in India as thoughchannelling its predecessors.The scholarly argument is that the last Sangam disappeared between 350-550 AD.If we accept this at face value and calculate backwards from the years ascribedto each Sangam, we arrive at the following founding dates: Third Sangam, 1500BC, Second Sangam, 5200 BC, First Sangam, 9600 BC, give or take a hundredyears.45 This places the first Academy of the Gods firmly around the period ofthe flood, again confirming Tamil oral traditions, not to mention those of theK'iche' Maya and the date given to Solon by the priests at Sais. That threeunconnected sources should use the same calendrical point of reference is beyondcoincidence. And there's no mistake about it, the oldest Tamil texts makereference to the submergence of no less than 700 kavatham (1000 miles) of Tamilland that once consisted of forty-nine counties filled with forests, rivers andhills that, due to three major submersions by the ocean, including the greatdeluge, forced people to move further and further north.46 This originalterritory was said to have once belonged to the oldest of dynasties, one ofwhose kings was a man by the name Nedyon, which transliterates as Tall One.47The descriptions of three sudden losses of land and their location betweensouthern India and modern day Sri Lanka fit remarkably well with the three majorrises in sea level that characterize the Dryas periods in this region,48presenting a good case for the Sangams dating to at least the time of the flood,when Sri Lanka, India and Kumari Kamdan formed a whole. However, when Buddhistmonks in the fourth century AD began writing down the oral traditions of SriLanka and compiling them into the Mahavamsa, Dipavansa and Rajavali, theydescribe the loss of large swathes of land beyond Sri Lanka due to three greatdeluges, one of which washed away \"twenty miles of coast, extending inland.\"49An older account appears to take place in antediluvian times and describes howthe giant king Ravana, ruler of a citadel with twenty-five palaces, was punishedby the gods for his heinous behavior.50So could the three Sangams be the product of an earlier tradition? Speaking atthe Fifth International Conference of Tamil Studies, chairman N. Mahalingampresented further evidence from the Mahavamsa, in which it is stated that KumariKamdan originally extended 4900 miles further south. He further states that \"thefirst great deluge took place in 16,000 BC, when a large part of Lemuria wassubmerged under the sea. The second one occurred in 14,058 BC when parts ofKumari Kandam went under the sea. The third one happened in 9564 BC when a largepart of Kumari Kandam was submerged. The fourth deluge is said to have occurredbetween the years 2939 BC and 2387 BC and almost coincides with the birth of theKaliyuga age.\"51The periods outlined in the Mahavamsa fit within the geological parameters ofthe three Dryas events. And since it mentions a fourth rise in sea level — theone that altered the coastline of the Persian Gulf and whose general dates areaccepted among the scientific community — it leads us to presume the more remotedates to be equally valid. But more to the point, the Mahavamsa states that theFirst Sangam was itself preceded by four earlier academies, meaning that we arenow looking at a tradition of knowledge, gods and civilization extending wellinto the prehistoric era, all suddenly vanished.52[images/00120.jpg]Meenakshi Temple, Madurai The city’s temple and academic culture is inheritedfrom antediluvian academies, long since overwhelmed by the Indian Ocean."},{"pageContent":"> 11. SEVEN TALL SAGES AND OTHER IMMORTALS.They could endue with power the substances on earth — Building TextsMyths materialized around the world to record for posterity the crashing ofaerial projectiles and the terrifying flood that ensued. Without exception thestories describe pockets of survivors being assisted by groups of unusuallooking people who appeared from the sea to teach them the accoutrementsrequired for starting, or re-starting, civilization.Each group consisted of seven individuals led by a charismatic eighth; theleader is always partnered with a wife who is also his sister: Osiris and Isisin Egypt, Enlil and Ninlil in Mesopotamia, Fu Hsi and Nu Hwa in China, Izanamiand Izanagi in Japan, Viracocha and his unnamed wife in the Andes, and probablyKiwa and Hotu Matu'a on Easter Island.At this point it might be useful to recall Manu, the Indus Valley flood hero whois identified in the Bhagvata Purana as Satyavrata, Lord of Dravida (southIndia). Predictably this righteous man is forewarned by the god Vishnu, whocomes to him disguised as a fish. Vishnu promises to return seven days later,during which time Manu is to gather seeds and animals. \"On the seventh day afterthis, the three worlds [Third World perhaps?] shall sink beneath the ocean ofdissolution. When the world is dissolved in that ocean, a large ship, sent byme, shall come to you.\"1Vishnu follows up on his promise in time for the fireworks to commence. \"Thesea, augmenting as the great clouds poured down their waters, was seenoverflowing its shores and everywhere inundating the earth.\"2It strikes me that Manu was not alone aboard this ship. As Vishnu continues:\"Surrounded by the Seven Sages... you shall embark on the great ship and shallmove without alarm over one dark ocean.” And further along: “In the world thusconfounded, the Seven Sages, Manu and the fish were beheld... the fish unwearieddrew the ship over the waters, and brought it at length to the highest peak ofHimavat [Himalaya]. Smiling, he gently says to the Sages, “'Bind this shipwithout delay to this peak.' They did so accordingly.\" 3[images/00121.jpg]Manu with the Seven Rshis. Although only one woman is part of such brotherhoods,she often holds the most important position, as teacher of secret knowledge andpropagator of the divine bloodline.Here we are faced once more with a group of seven wisdom keepers led by aneighth, who appear within an antediluvian environment and survive the flood.They are renowned seafarers (hence the fish symbolism), they bring the gifts ofcivilization to the surviving human population, wear simple tunics, shun meat infavor of vegetables, grow their hair long, perform their spiritual attuning athigh altitudes, and set examples of spiritual decorum that society may imitate —the foundation for the Hindu principle of dharma and the Egyptian maat. TheSeven Sages advised rulers, but when those rulers stepped beyond the rules ofcivilized behavior, they would take on the role of kingship themselves until alegitimate individual was procured and appointed. If kings abused their powerthe Sages would curse them, sometimes with severe consequences.4If these were the same magnificent seven led by Viracocha, K’uKuulKaan,Quetzalcoatl, Fu Hsi and so on, they must have had supersonic means oftransportation at their disposal, because they appear simultaneously in amultitude of locations around the world. Realistically I suspect what we aredealing with here is a brotherhood, an institution emanating from a centrallocation, or locations, each secluded from ordinary humans until circumstancesforce them to establish direct contact. The Mahabaratha agrees with part of thishypothesis when it claims, \"there are many Seven Sages.\"5 And given theircomfort with the open seas, they may all have lived on islands.The Vedas specify that the closing of every Yuga or Great Age is accompaniedand defined by a major pralaya (catastrophe), whereby all traces of the formerYuga are erased. It is at these junctures that such groups of wisdom keepers areselected to ride out the storm so that the accumulated wisdom may berepromulgated, ensuring the resurrection and continuation of knowledge thatunderpins civilization.6From the surviving accounts in the Rgveda, the Seven Sages or Sapta Rsis, aremortal individuals who have been raised to the status of gods through theirknowledge of sacred things, ostensibly knowledge handed down since the dawn oftime, which they memorized, practiced, and shared with others so that the humancondition might be elevated in their time. They knew of the forces of nature andhow to control them, they possessed unique gifts of telepathy and clairvoyance,and generally mastered the arts leading to spiritual refinement. Notsurprisingly they were esteemed as second only to the one supreme God.7 Whilethere is no doubt this institution was replenished by fresh recruits, the Vedasdo hint at reincarnation, even an extraterrestrial element, because it is saidthese people come to Earth periodically in order to renew Vedic knowledge.8[images/00122.jpg]Izanami and Izanagi raise Japan from the ocean. Like all antediluvian gods, inaddition to being married, they were also brother-sister.So what are we to make of this, because the Seven Sages also feature prominentlyin the Building Texts of Egypt, in which they are described arriving from anisland to the south named Ta-Neterw, \"the Homeland of the Primeval Ones,\"following its destruction by a great flood in which the “majority of its divineinhabitants drowned.”9 The gods Hor/Horus and Twt/Thoth subsequently appear onthe scene accompanied by Seven Sages, who are referred to as Aku Shemsu Hor —Shining Ones, Followers of Horus.10THE GODS LIVE LONG. AND PROSPERAlthough they cover a substantial portion of the perimeter wall of the temple ofEdfu, the existing Building Texts are a mere fragment of a vast Egyptianprehistoric record recovered by Alexander the Great and the Ptolemaic pharaohswho followed. It is a fascinating narrative describing the arrival of gods andthe creation of temple culture, even if it sometimes makes for confusingcommentary.It speaks of the First Occasion, when humans were given the gifts ofcivilization by a group of puissant male and female gods who governed the landfrom their seat at Iwnw and various satellite temples along the Nile. To quotethe Egyptian historian Hassan: “The Egyptians believed that in the beginningtheir land was ruled by a dynasty of great gods, of whom Horus, the son of Isisand Osiris, was the last. He was succeeded by a dynasty of semi-divine beingsknown as the Followers of Horus, who, in turn, gave place to the historicalkings of Egypt.”11If the First Occasion is dated correctly to 10,400 BC then the Building Textsdescribe the company of gods arriving in Egypt following the first destructionof Ta-Neterw at the start of the Younger Dryas, meaning part of their island wasstill extant until the events around the great flood finished it off for good.Once settled in Egypt, Hor and his merry companions had barely seven hundredyears in which to re-establish new temple cities before facing the great flood,after which they returned to rebuild a project already in motion. Thishypothesis is consistent with the level of erosion at buildings such as theValley Temple and the Menkaure Pyramid Temple, both of which show considerableweathering of their original limestone slabs by water and a subsequentretrofitting with harder granite to address the damage.[images/00123.jpg]A section of the Building Texts at Edfu.Like the gods in whose footsteps they followed, the Aku Shemsu Hor are describedas physically elegant, and possessing supernatural powers that gave them controlover the forces of nature, and for this reason their collective name, Neterw,makes no distinction between an aspect of nature, an individual or a god. Thethree were interchangeable because their qualities were reflected in each other.For example, it was said the seven Shining Ones had the ability \"to endue withpower the substances on earth,\" foretell the future, and provide magicalprotection by means of symbols and the giving of names. They were creators ofcivilization,12 real rather than abstract beings capable of succumbing to humanfrailties. It was not uncommon for later individuals to take on the names ofthese gods as totems whenever they portrayed the qualities of such gods, hencethere existed many Osiris, Twt, and Isis, just as there were many Quetzalcoatl.One striking feature of these physical gods was their ability to rule forimmense periods of time, they were practically immortal by human standards. OfRa it was said he ruled for so long that in time he became a stumbling old manwith saliva running down the side of his mouth. His successor Shu also got tiredof reigning for hundreds of years, particularly after a major tempest lastingfor nine days tested his limits and finally convinced him to abdicate in favorof his son Geb.13Egyptian scholars such as Maspero considered the prehistory of their country todate back 36,000 years.14 Later compilers such as Manetho, Diodorus andSyncellus followed suit with a range between 36,000 to 39,000 years. These seemunrealistic lengths of time, yet a papyrus discovered in Luxor in 1824 sets outthe timeline in graphic terms. Dated c.1400 BC, it was taken to Turin forexamination (it is known as the Turin Papyrus), but by the time it was finallyopened, the papyrus disintegrated. Despite its condition it was still possibleto establish a total of nine dynasties belonging to pre-dynastic pharaohs. Theoldest belonged to the Venerables of Memfer — Neterw such as Ra, Osiris, Isis,Hor, Set and Twt — who reigned for 23,200 years. They were succeeded byVenerables of the North, the Aku Shemsu-Hor, who settled at Iwnw, and reignedfor 13,420 years until the time of Menes, described as the first pharaoh of\"purely human bloodline,\" who gained the throne c.3113 BC. A total of 36,620years.15 The main point of interest here concerns the 13,420-year reign of theAku Shemsu Hor until the time of Menes, indicating that the Followers of Horuswere not merely a group who survived the great flood, they were in existence6000 years before the founding of Iwnw, a continuous tradition of sages.Roman scholars such as Mela and Herodotus offer additional information based onaccounts provided to them by the priests at Iwnw who insisted such numbers werenot pure fantasy, the events described actually occurred and were based onphysical observation. “The Egyptians pride themselves on being the most ancientpeople in the world. In their authentic annals one may read that since they havebeen in existence, the course of the stars has changed direction four times, andthat the Sun has set twice in the part of the sky where it rises today.”16If these commentators are referring to the passage of time through the houses ofthe Zodiac, then in Herodotus’ time, when the Sun rose in Aries and set in Libraat the spring equinox, two completions of this cycle would have begun 39,000years before his time.17The historical timeline of Egypt and the dazzling longevity of its early rulerswould seem aberrant were it not for other civilizations claiming the samebiological magic, such as the Sumerians and their breathtaking King List. Thebest-preserved specimen is the Weld-Blundell Prism, a vertical cylinder made ofclay inscribed with cuneiform c.2170 BC. The document provides a comprehensivelist of the Sumerian Kings from the beginning when \"kingship descended fromheaven, the kingship was in Eridug... In five cities, eight kings; they ruledfor 241,200 years. Then the flood swept over.” The prism was found a few milesto the north of Ur, at Larsa, home of the fourth antediluvian king Kichunna.Such numbers seem almost abstract, even if we allow the Sumerians thepossibility of having employed a method of computation now lost to us; theEgyptians themselves are known to have employed a calendar based on the motionof Sirius. This Sothic Cycle synchronizes with the solar year with only a marginof error of one month every 1460 years. According to Manetho, recorded Egyptianhistory is composed of 25 periods of 1460 Sothic cycles, or one full revolutionaround the Zodiac, which takes us into the region of 23,000 BC.18Ancient writers in other parts of the world routinely assert how dynasties inremote civilizations spanned eccentric spans of time. For example, the TroanoManuscript describes twelve Maya Kun dynasties reigning for 16,000 years, whilethe Chinese Tchi mentions twelve dynasties reigning 18,000 years, as do Hindurecords which state, \"in those times men lived as long as they chose to live andwere without any fear of [the god of Death].\"19THE GODS GO FLYINGThe Kujiki forms the backbone of Japan’s prehistoric texts concerning deitiesand the descent of kingship from the sky. They are estimated to be at least10,000 years old. In the narrative, a period of 1,722,475 years elapses betweenthe descent of the Sky Kami (a god or spirit form) and the first imperial familywho became its earthly representatives and continued its values into historicaltimes.20 The Sky Kami brings a civilizing influence to bear on a desolate andviolent world, flying to Earth in a Sky-Rock-Boat to a place called Tsukushi,the Center of the World — a navel by any other name — identified as the islandof Kyushu on the south-western tip of Japan. In one account, in order to reachthis island it was necessary to travel eastwards, implying that the point oforigin of the gods might have been the Korean peninsula.[images/00124.jpg]Iyefune, the boat of the gods. Mt. Miwa.Japan's oldest religious practice, Shinto (Way of the Gods) describesantediluvian heroes moving around in flying boats, the legends born fromobservation and likely handed down through Japan's oldest culture, the Jomon,who state their ancestors were gods who settled the region some 12,000 yearsago. They may be right because the Jomon were already established by 14,000 BC,thus not only did they experience all the Dryas cycles, they would have observedthe gods dispensing the virtues of civilization after each cataclysm.The flying rock boats are easy to locate. To the east of Kyushu, near Osaka,stands a 500-ton Ishi-no-högen (The Departing Stone). This upright monolith iscut to look as though it floats over a sacred spring that never dries, evenduring drought. It's a massive cube marked with deep, vertical grooves and apair of rectangular incisions on top; a pyramid extrudes from its side whichrequired the removal and re-shaping of half the block, and yet not one tool markis visible. It is impressive as it is alien, and neatly conveys the image of arock ship flown by the prehistoric gods. Legends speak of two gods, Okunisushi(Great Land Master) and Sukuna-biko-na setting out to build a temple in thecourse of one night but only got as far as creating this monolith due to a localrebellion breaking out among other gods.[images/00125.jpg]Botanist Philipp Franz Siebold sketched Ishi-no-högen while he was stationed inJapan in the 1920s. Again the mysterious protruding knob so unique to ancientarchitecture. But what is it for?Another example is Iyefune (rock ship), located in dense forest to the east ofOsaka on Mount Miwa, one of Japan's most sacred mountains, an area filled withthe type of machined megaliths common to the Andes. This single granite slabweighs 800 tons, and features deep, rectangular sections incised from the topall the way through to the core as though made by a surgeon armed with a laser.Many eastern traditions unambiguously state that in the time of gods, people hadthe capacity for flight, be it using a ladder, magical rope, flying vimannacraft, or in the case of Japan, stone boats. The stories are common to the Joraiof Indochina, the Koryaks of Central Asia, and is especially mentioned in theIndian epic Mahabharata: \"Visvakarma, the architect among the gods, built aerialvehicles for the gods... You descendent of the Kurus, that wicked fellow came onthat all-traversing flying vehicle known as Saubhapura and pierced me withweapons... He entered into the favourite divine palace of Indra and sawthousands of flying vehicles intended for the gods lying at rest... Indra, theLord of Heaven came with a special type of flying vehicle which couldaccommodate 33 divine beings.”21[images/00126.jpg]A Dol Hareubang in Korea. Always the focus on the navel, and large eyes.I can't help but recall the earlier story of the Waitaha receiving a group ofmaster craftsmen with narrow eyes from the north after the flood, magicianscapable of “shaping rock without breaking its spirit,” because all around theisland of Kyushu lies evidence of antediluvian gods possessing extraordinaryskills in masonry, particularly on the Korean peninsula which is but a shortboat ride away. Before the flood, both locations were joined as one landmass,and included Taiwan to the south. The Korean peninsula itself contains thegreatest concentration of dolmen in the world, a tradition that is now seen asoriginating here before migrating westwards to Europe. For one thing, dol is theKorean word for stone.TALL, SHINING AND LONG-HEADEDBetween South Korea and Kyushu lies the small island of Jeju, home to an unusualconcentration of 12-foot tall statues carved from porous basalt. They are calledDol Hareubang (grandfather stone), and are said to depict in size and style theancestors who came here after the flood, outsiders who were very tall magicians.An earlier name, Beoksumeori, means 'head of the shaman'. A number of statuesbear a striking resemblance to those of Viracocha around Lake Titicaca, rightdown to the position of the hands above and below the navel.Throughout our quest I’ve made references to very tall people (as opposed togiants) whose lives straddled the boundary at the close of the Younger Dryas. Iwant to revisit this topic, along with that of elongated skulls, because bothoverlap in Egypt. The Building Texts describe intermediaries between gods andhumans as Urshu, a term applied in conjunction with the half human, half divineAku Shemsu Hor. The texts put their height at 5 cubits. Depending on the type ofcubit used, the Royal or the Sacred, these individuals would have stood between8.5 and 10.25 feet tall.Mesopotamian tradition follows suit. Post-flood Apkallu such as Lu-Nanna aresaid to have been two-thirds Apkallu one-third human,22 while the flood heroGilgamesh, himself part Apkallu, is described in the Book of Giants as lugal,meaning ‘big man or giant’;23 in the Hittite version of the epic, Gilgamesh wassaid to be 11 cubits tall, or 18 feet, meaning that the statue currently ondisplay in the Louvre depicts this man life-size.24The Aku Shemsu Hor were also biologically different in that their skulls werenaturally elongated, just like the people we dealt with earlier in Peru, Malta,and the region around the Black Sea. I refer to them affectionately as LongHeads. In the words of the prominent Egyptologist Walter Emery: \"Towards theclose of the fourth millennium BC we find the people known traditionally as theFollowers of Horus forming a civilized aristocracy or master race ruling overthe whole of Egypt. The theory of the existence of this master race is supportedby the discovery that graves of the late pre-dynastic period in the northernpart of Upper Egypt were found to contain the anatomical remains of a peoplewhose skulls are of greater size and whose bodies were larger than those of thenatives, the difference being so marked that any suggestion that these peoplederived from the earlier stock is impossible. The fusion of the two races musthave been considerable, but it was not so rapid... The dawn of the historicperiod of Egypt was divided into the two rival kingdoms of the North and theSouth, both ruled by a royal house and aristocracy of the same race and bothknown traditionally as the Followers of Horus — the demigods of Manetho’shistory. The original capitals of those two states appear to have been Buto inLower Egypt and Hieraconpolis in Upper Egypt; but at the time of the finalunification, the chief cities of the two powers were apparently Sais in thenorth and Thinis (or Abydos) in the south.\"25The dissertation by Walter Emery is correct in many respects except for thedate. The Followers of Horus may indeed have been the offspring of theantediluvian gods, but the Building Texts have them well established in Egyptlong before the flood.26 Hor himself was venerated much earlier. The city ofButo, formerly known as Tell El Fara'in, Hill of the Pharaohs, once featured arenowned monolithic sanctuary dedicated to this antediluvian god. The city'simportance was built on cultural developments spanning ten thousand years, fromthe Paleolithic to 3100 BC, implying that the cult of Hor was already wellestablished there around the time of the Oldest Dryas. Likewise Hieraconpolis,formerly Nekhen, was a mound city with similar prehistoric roots, also under thetutelage of Hor.Although half human, half divine, the Followers of Horus were loathe to couplewith human women for the obvious reason that a man twice as tall as a womanraises life threatening complications at birth for the mother. The second reasonwas to maintain the purity of bloodline of a people who appear to have kept onefoot in the astral world while simultaneously living in a physical body. Thisunderpinned the Shining Ones' declared ability to work their magic, to controlthe laws of nature. For this reason they developed skulls elongated in the rearand capable of housing a larger parietal cortex, the area of the brainassociated with spiritual and dream states.27 By comparison, humans have a moredeveloped frontal cerebral cortex in order to process information.But thousands of years after their appearance, the lineage of the Followers ofHorus began to thin out. They were faced with a grim choice: accept annihilationor find a way to successfully interbreed with human women, the results of whichare confirmed by Emery's findings. This successful transition between two racesultimately culminated in Menes, “first pharaoh of a totally human bloodline”c.3113 BC.28 That said, remnants of the Followers of Horus survived well intothe second millennium BC, as attested by Amenhotep III with his elongated skull,and likewise his son and grandson, Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, although theproblems of long-term interbreeding had by then led to obvious physicaldeformations.[images/00127.jpg]The lineage of the long-headed Followers of Horus was still evident in AmenhotepIII.One branch of this lineage of sages may have survived into our era. In the earlytwentieth century there existed in China's Schechuan province a race called theLolos. Inhabiting an area the size of Wales, these highly independent peoplewere taller than Caucasians, with prominent cheekbones, broad, arched noses, andpointed chins. They possessed a unique pictographic script and a belief that foreach person on Earth there is a corresponding star in the sky. They alsopossessed an I-Pu, an ancestral tablet composed of wooden pieces cut from thePieris tree, the same type from which the ark in their flood myth wasconstructed. They believed in patriarchs who live in the sky, among whom are theCreator gods A-chi and A-li — who appear to be variations of the Mesopotamianantediluvian gods Enki and Enlil — and Tse-gu-dzih, the one attributed withcausing the great flood after becoming frustrated with the wickedness of humans.These patriarchs lived outrageously long lives of 660 and 990 yearsrespectively. After Tse-gu-dzih opened the sluice gates of the sky to releasetorrents of water, only one man, Du-mu, was saved in a hollowed out log alongwith his four sons.29MAGICIANS AND WIZARDSThere is no shortage of magician gods in Egypt. Twt, who is attributed withauthorship of every branch of knowledge both human and divine, is also describedas the Great Lord of Magic who could move objects with the power of his voice.30He understood “all that is hidden under the heavenly vault” and was described as“the counter of stars and the measure of the Earth.” He also is said to haveinvented writing, was a great mathematician and surveyor, and would bestow hiswisdom on anyone smart enough to handle such knowledge.31 Shortly before theflood he is said to have inscribed the sum of all knowledge in books of amaterial that is resistant to damage by conflagration, hiding them in Egypt andthroughout the Earth, to be rediscovered “only by the worthy,” individuals whowould apply the information to elevate a society reduced to rubble.32Isis was said to be “more intelligent than countless gods, of knowing everythingin heaven and earth, being strong of tongue... perfect both in giving commandand in saying the word. She possessed the understanding of the power of words,incantations and spells with which to bend nature and the known laws ofphysics.”33Her consort Osiris was considered one of the original Wise Ones in the Egyptianpantheon. The name is a Greek phonetic transliteration of the original WSR(pronounced Asar), a word which became the root of vizier, and ostensibly,wizard. Osiris is portrayed as a bearded god, a civilizer who brought with himthe knowledge of agriculture, animal husbandry, astronomy, writing, architectureand music, and not forgetting, a spiritual science underpinning a rightful lifeand laws leading to the immortality of the soul. He also led the way to buildingcities, temples, and implementing just laws. Business cards must have beenawkwardly long back then. Thankfully he was rewarded with a short nickname, 'theGood One' — as was his Irish counterpart Daghda Mor, 'the Good God', who issimilarly depicted wearing a ceremonial beard, and a white robe with a thinwaist sash; just as the Shining Ones wore beards and white robes with beadedsashes; as did the civilizing god of the Indus region, Zarathustra, whoseteachings are claimed by his followers to have been already fully implemented by7500 BC.34It seems both Osiris and Viracocha might have been separated at birth, becausein physical description and deed they belong to the same brotherhood of sevensages. Many overlapping legends exist of Viracocha throughout the Andes but theygenerally agree that this blue-eyed, white man possessed a power over the forcesof nature, while his words and deeds earned him the image of a scientist,engineer, astronomer, architect, teacher and healer all rolled into one: “Hecaused the terraces and fields to be formed on the steep sides of ravines, andsustaining walls to rise up and support them. He also made irrigation channelsto flow from the living stone... and he went in various directions, arrangingmany things.”35Such terraforming and stonework are evident in the epic works at Ollantaytambo.Only in the fifteenth century did the Inca inherit and restore this citadel,adapting it for their own needs, along with the 15,000-mile network of roadsthat everyone in the region knew full well had been the work of “white,auburn-haired men who’d lived thousands of years earlier.”36 Viracocha achievedit all with the assistance of seven Hayhuaypanti, each a specialist in his orher field. Writing in the first decade of the seventeenth century, thechronicler Garcilaso de la Vega reminds us of the magic once imbued in Cuzco byViracocha and his Shining Ones. Garcilaso describes how the streams flowingunder and around the Qorikancha, where the Navel of the Earth stood, wereendowed with special properties. He goes on to lament the state of disrepair ofthe water system after the Spanish conquest, particularly one stream that rose alittle to the west of the city, the water of which had been so prized for itsfecund properties that special piping had to be laid underneath the city to takeit from the royal vegetable garden to the temple. The special plumbing wasnecessary, Garcilaso wrote, because its water caused such vigorous plant growththat it would have damaged the buildings had it leaked onto the land beneath thecity’s walls and pavements.37Hawaiian folklore is likewise filled with stories of the Menehune from theislands of Molokai and Kauai, legendary people with magical powers who were ableto control the forces of nature. Like their counterparts elsewhere, they wereknown for their ability to miraculously build temples of stone overnight.38Such innate abilities of the antediluvian gods are affirmed in the Popol Vuh.\"They were endowed with intelligence; they saw and instantly they could see far,they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in theworld. When they looked, instantly they saw all around them, and theycontemplated in turn the arch of heaven and the round face of the earth. Thethings hidden in the distance they saw all without first having to move; at oncethey saw the world, and so too, from where they were, they saw it. Great wastheir wisdom; their sight reached to the forests, the lakes, the seas, themountains, and the valleys.\"39 These individuals worked many miracles,40 butalas their magical abilities led to a number of them developing arrogance andabusing their gifts, ironically leading to their demise,41 when their folly ranfoul of the tolerance of greater gods who pressed the reset button and unleasheda cataclysm.42A sage from Kumari Kandam would agree with the above account from CentralAmerica, because the same descriptions, the same events, the same issues, andthe same final outcome are recorded throughout the Vedas.[images/00128.jpg]Tiki from New Guinea, and Hiva Oa in the Marquesas. Although stylizeddepictions, the thin lips, bulging eyes and elongated skulls are characteristicsdescribed by cultures who came in contact with flood sages."},{"pageContent":"> 12. PEOPLE OF THE SERPENTEarly Roman chroniclers refer to an ancient people living in the western IberianPeninsula as Lusitanii, the People of Light. Physical traces of their existenceare now scant, but they live on in legends which paint them as autonomous,highly religious people who followed the ways of nature and harnessed itsmagical qualities, the knowledge of which they shared throughout the region,hence their depiction as traveling gods. They constructed impressive stonetemples and were said to have been unusually tall.This land is today called Portugal, and aside from the Morbihan region ofBrittany, it possesses some of the oldest stone circles, dolmens and passagemounds in Europe, some tentatively dated to 5300 BC, based on the lowerhabitation layer of accumulated debris. Realistically they are likely to be farolder. The mountainous north became the Lusitannii center of operation, a regionwhere one comes across anomalous structures such as carved granite boulders nearthe village of Panoias. One is the size of a house and has had its top incisedwith square and circular holes, some with bevelled edges that look like slotsfor inserting upright slabs, not unlike the technique employed at Göbekli Tepe.The boulders feature a series of deep, rectangular tanks; shallow and perfectlylevel ledges connect each feature without any sign of tool marks. On the side,steps cut in relief are impractically high for people of this region who tend tobe rather short.I have seen almost a dozen similar structures in Peru, three in and aroundSaqsayhuaman and Quillarumyioc alone, their ledges astronomically aligned, withfeatures illustrating certain creation myths as well as Mysteries teachings. Thewear on the steps at Panoias attests to their great antiquity, yet there islittle indication as to the purpose of such hillside monuments. Aside from theobvious visual connection it is impossible to prove any further link betweenPanoias and Peru, although, ironically, when the Portuguese dictator Salazarinvented an artificial folk identity to galvanize the Portuguese in the 1940s,he copied the traditional dress patterns and colors of indigenous Peruvians.Perhaps he inadvertently channelled an ancient connection![images/00129.jpg][images/00130.jpg][images/00131.jpg]Panoias megaliths bear a strong resemblance to those in the Andes. particularlyin Saqsayhuaman (middle), and Sumba, Indonesia.Like the stone boats of Japan’s antediluvian gods, the enigmatic boulders may bethe handiwork of the People of Light, who may themselves have been the progenyof a far older group — the Shining Ones, as the name implies — who fled acrossthe Atlantic in search of high ground. Portugal, after all, is conveniently thefirst dry land east of the Açores, the first landfall being a mountain calledSintra.The Greek historian Strabo describes in his Geographica a people of differentappearance living around Sintra, specifically on a promontory extending from themountain for a considerable distance out to sea. Strabo may have been relying ona far older source because that promontory collapsed into the Atlantic thousandsof years before his time, taking with it a citadel. Such a large piece of landcould only have disintegrated through the action of some titanic force, perhapsthe same wall of water that afflicted the Maltese islands in the Mediterranean,after all Sintra and Malta would have shared the same trajectory of wavesoriginating in the central Atlantic; they also share the same geology, both areunderpinned by vast subterranean tunnels, and sit on delicate fracture zones.Additionally, a deep layer of sand stretches forty miles from Sintra and intocentral Portugal, evidence of a massive tsunami that smashed the region inprehistoric times.Trekking among the eucalyptus groves of Sintra is one of life's uniquepleasures. By its very location adjacent to the Atlantic, the mountain createsits own cool microclimate, handy for days when temperatures on the surroundingplains force one to seek the shelter of shade or a café. Colossal moss-coveredgranite boulders lie everywhere, discarded like crumbs on a giant's dinnerplate.One of Sintra's summits is connected by a honeycomb of underground galleries toanother hill thirty-five miles away, to the point where the sea is able topenetrate these inland caverns, leading Arab chroniclers to describe Sintra as ahollow mountain.1 Although a good number are of volcanic and sedimentary origin,other cavities have been purposefully carved by human hands. According to aformer caretaker of the Moorish castle on one such summit, Sintra is a bigsubterranean city criss-crossed with miles of underground tunnels, one linkingthe castle with a Capuchin monastery three miles away.2Sintra takes its name from the Mesopotamian lunar goddess Sin. Lunar cults havepracticed here since 7000 BC,3 with human activity already established between8000 – 10,000 BC.4 Whoever these people were they certainly had a flair for thedramatic. During one of many visits, I came across a local legend of a passagelinking the east-west spine of the mountain, each entrance forming a portal tothe Otherworld. It was impossible to pass up such a tempting opportunity, so Ispent two days clambering through boulders, undergrowth and mist to be rewardedwith the sight of the remains of a large passage mound on the western edge ofthe mountain, its earthen canopy long since washed away by the ocean-driven rainthat typically pours here, its stones almost blending with the bedrock, andfurther dislodged by earthquakes, for Sintra lies on a highly volatilesubduction plate. Perched high on a ridge, the entrance features an unobstructedview of the equinox sunset over the Atlantic — obviously the gods were romantics— so I hazarded a guess that the exit would fall along the same alignment to theeast, to face the sunrise.[images/00132.jpg]Passage mound in Sintra, home of the People of the Serpent.It did, at another megalithic passage mound conveniently located inside theentrance to the grounds of Pena Palace four miles away. Standing inconspicuouslyamid the overgrown ferns and still resembling a dolmen, it is easily overlookedby thousands of visitors unless they forego the taxi ride and leg it up thesteep footpath. The connecting tunnel, claimed to link the two sites, has longsince been blocked with rubble from thousands of years of seismic activity.A week rummaging through Sintra leaves you in no doubt that the people describedby the Greek commentators were comfortable working on a megalithic scale, anddid so on a mountain that, to all intents and purposes, functions in isolationto its surrounding territory, much like an island. In remote times the regionwas known as Promontorio Ofiússa (Promontory of the Serpent), its residentsbeing the Ofiússa (People of the Serpent).5 Furthermore, the Portuguese coastappears in legends and traditions as the cradle of a royal or sacred bloodlinedescended from an antediluvian race, with Lisbon itself founded by Ophiusa,literally Serpent Woman, and like the Anunaki of Mesopotamia, she was portrayedas half-human half-fish.6 Strabo, it seems, was on the right track.The association with serpents has nothing to do with the worship of snakes perse. The serpent or dragon refers to the entwining telluric currents ofelectricity and magnetism that flow along and through Earth and space. Sincethese forces are invisible to the eye, the serpent was adopted as theanimalistic metaphor to visually express their movement. It is one of the oldestculturally shared symbols. However, there is also a second layer of meaning.Anyone who sensed, controlled or manipulated such forces was considered aserpent priest, a magi (magician), or sorcerer (one who works with the source).These sages were also symbolically associated with an amphibian creature, thenewt — ewte, to coin its etymological origin, which means 'resplendent mind' —thus anyone who works with Earth energies also develops numinous qualities. Oneof the last cults to embody these principles was the Druid, whose titles wereenumerated thus: \"I am a Druid; I am an architect; I am a prophet; I am aserpent.”7The writer and spiritualist Paul Brunton made an erudite observation abouttelluric forces and the qualities of people who personified them: \"The serpentis self-moving; it is unassisted by hands, feet or external limbs. So too is theCreative Force entirely self-moving as it passes from form to form in itsbuilding of a whole world or a single creature... [its symbolism] stood for theworking of the Force which freed the soul of man during initiation, a forcewhich slowly crept through the body of the entranced initiate almost exactlylike the slow creeping of a snake.\"8Magicians? Earth energy? Special powers? This should all be familiar territoryby now. Etymology and symbolism aside, there is no surviving evidence of thesePeople of the Serpent having come to Iberia overland from the east via Europe.What if their point of origin was from the west, across the water from Atitlánor what remained of it? Let’s see if a connecting thread exists on the otherside of the Atlantic that might improve our understanding of the antediluviangods.KAANUL, A SERPENT BY ANY OTHER NAMEThe earliest foreigners in Yucatan were the Itzá sages who arrived on boats fromthe east following the loss of Atitlán. They were generally referred to asKaanul— literally People of the Serpent — led by the magician priest Itzamna,whose title was Serpent of the East. In time their progeny, the Maya, also cameto refer to themselves as People of the Serpent; their secondary title,Descendents From Cosmic Wisdom, offers a clue to the knowledge they inheritedfrom the Itzá.9As we already know, Yucatan has three central flood heroes: Itzamna, K’uKuulKaanand Quetzalcoatl. All three individuals arrived in modern-day Coatzelcoalcosfrom across the Atlantic on a boat “with sides that shone like the scales ofserpent skins.”10 Up until now their overlapping attributes have led many tobelieve they are one and the same entity. However, the responsibility of alarge-scale reconstruction of their original homeland in this region couldn'tpossibly have fallen upon the shoulders of one person alone. As Indian textsstate, \"there were many Seven Sages,\" so I am inclined to follow the commonsense hypothesis that these were three separate individuals in charge of threebrotherhoods, each linked to the same institution and race. The description ofQuetzalcoatl is not dissimilar to that of Itzamna: a tall, white man with broadforehead, large eyes and flowing beard, dressed in a long white robe reaching tohis feet. He condemned the killing of things except for fruits and plants,taught people the use of fire for cooking, how to build houses, and demonstratedthat couples could live together. He introduced writing and the calendar, taughtthe secrets of masonry and architecture, mathematics, metallurgy, medicine,divination (dowsing), astronomy and the measure of the Earth, and agriculture,specifically the introduction of domesticated corn, the staple of this region.He was a patron of the arts, and a peacemaker who, when addressed on the subjectof war, plugged his ears with his fingers. To these qualities can be addedcivilizer, founder of laws, cities and temples.11[images/00133.jpg]K’uKuulKaan. Labnah, Yucatan.The Maya know exactly where their wisdom comes from and the qualities of thegods who provided it: “In truth, they were admirable men... They were able toknow all, and they examined the four corners, the four points of the arch of thesky, and the round face of the earth.”12 These People of the Serpent werespecialists in their fields. K’uKuulKaan's companions are described as “two weregods of fish, two others gods of agriculture, and a god of thunder.”13 Andaccording to the Popol Vuh, “they were not men... they were giants.” Afterspending ten years establishing laws, temples and administrative buildings atthe temple city of Mayapan, K’uKuulKaan is said to have joined a raft ofserpents, and together they set sail towards the rising sun and returned towhere they'd originated,14 implying there may have been parts of Atitlán stillabove the sea after the flood, ostensibly today’s Açores. In any event, theywere compelled to live in seclusion from humans, much as they had done beforetheir arrival.[images/00134.jpg]Itzamna as a wise, and bearded, old man. Chichen Itzã.But not everyone returned. K’uKuulKaan and his sages left Itzamna and company tojourney inland towards Guatemala to erect the temple cities of Tikal andPalenque, which were referred to as Serpent Cities in homage of founders such asNohoch-Itz-Tzaab (Great Face of the Rattlesnake), the astronomer priestresponsible for the original Pyramid of K’uKuulKaan at Chichen Itzá. In turn,Chichen Itzá’s original name Uuc Yabnal (Seven Great House) pays homage to theseven Kaanul priests as well the Pleiades.A tall stela in the temple of Ek Balam shows a ruler surrounded by a featheredserpent, identifying him as a member of the Kaanul dynasty, According to theTroano Codex this divine bloodline had already run for 16,000 years by the timethe Spanish arrived in the sixteenth century, implying that either the dynastywas already established in Yucatan before the flood, or it originated in Atitlánitself. Ek Balam’s main building contains 106 chambers, one of which features adoorway surrounded by thirty-three large teeth and elaborate images, all instucco. Among them are seven An-Hel (Beings of Creation), each winged figurerepresenting an original Itzá flood teacher. The approach to this steppedrectangular structure is marked by a building romantically named Structure Xwhose original footprint appears to be aligned to the spring equinox in the eraof 7000 BC.When the Balam (Jaguar) wisdom keepers arrived from the Pacific — for the sameunderlying reason as the Itzá — their teachings overlapped, whereupon futureMaya masters of the city of Palenque took on combined Mu'ul-Atitlán titles suchas Lord Kaan Balam.[images/00135.jpg]Two Itz shown as winged An-Hel, a possible precursor of angel. Ek Balam,Yucatan.The serpent emblem became synonymous with future individuals who personified thetraditions of the original People of the Serpent. They adopted the names ofthese gods and became an example to others,15 hence there have been manyK’uKuulKaan — an honorary title meaning 'feathered serpent'. \"The title is inallusion to a spiritual mastery in science and spirituality,\" explains MiguelAngel Vergara. \"KuKuul represents the feathers, the sacred spiritual knowledgeof the cosmos; Kan represents science, technology, mathematics, astronomy,geometry. When the two practices are harmonized, the initiate takes on thecomposite name.\"16The same practice was followed in Egypt and the Middle East.The lineage of the People of the Serpent was still active throughout Guatemalawell into the 8th century. Temple cities such as Holmui carried the snakeheademblem of the royal house, although by historical times the clans had descendedinto feuding families whose warring and bickering bore little resemblance to theethics of the original lineage17— ironically the kind of behavior that once ledthe creator gods to flood the Earth 11,000 years ago, according to the myths. Analtar dated 544 AD at Guatemala’s La Corona site suggests the Kaanul dynasty ofSnake Kings acted like its namesake in slowly squeezing the life out of therival kingdom of Tikal. It even depicts the ruler Chak Took Ich’aak attemptingto conjure two gods from a shaft in the form of a snake.18SERPENTS IN THE EASTWe now have a clearer picture of the lineage of wisdom keepers who escapedAtitlán to found new homelands east and west of the Atlantic. However, this isonly half the story. The progenitors of the Olmec are said to have arrived inCentral America from the sunken Pacific island of Mu’ul, as did a tribe inArizona, who now provide a further link to the Pacific and beyond.The Hopi were originally defined by a number of separate yet interconnectedclans, one being the Snake Clan. One narrative describes how Hopi ancestorslived in or close to Patowahkacheh (Great Water). Somewhere on this ocean lay anisland where the original Snake People once lived; nearby was a second islandbelonging to Koyanwuhti, the goddess of wisdom. The story involves a young manwho goes on an adventure to these islands and marries a beautiful maiden, andalthough on one level the tale appears to depict the allegorical path of aninitiate, it also commemorates actual events from long ago, for the Snake Clanis very real, forced as it was to sail eastwards from an island in the Pacificconsumed by the flood. Following a considerable period of migration, the clansettled at Kawestima in Arizona (today known as Betatakin), where they wereknown as Hisat-Sinom. It was a home they shared with unusual beings calledkatcisam; this will be of great importance later. Finally they moved to Walpi, aHopi village on First Mesa, Arizona.19 What is fascinating is the linguistictrail linking their story to the central Pacific, for example, the Hopi wordtsu'a (snake) is the same as the Samoan sua.20 Therefore it is likely that, inaddition to Atitlán, the People of the Serpent had a base in the East.A divine hierarchy of dragon lords is known to have been present within Chineseculture for at least 7000 years,21 although the association stretches intoantediluvian times. According to legend, both Chinese primogenitors were closelyrelated to lóng (dragons). At the end of his reign the first ruler was himselfimmortalized into a dragon and ascended to the sky; the next was born by hismother's telepathy with a dragon, and ever since, the ancient Chinese haveself-identified as descendants of the dragon,22 suggesting the presence of adivine bloodline borne of the mating between gods and humans. This symbolic aswell as probable genetic connection is enforced by the lineage of Chinesemonarchs who took on the title Son of Heaven whenever they cemented amatrimonial bond. The phrase was interpreted literally in China and Japan, whosemonarchs described themselves as half-human half-divine — just as in Iberia,India, Scythia, Egypt and Mesopotamia — or as the living image of gods,23insinuating once again how they were offspring of the original People of theSerpent.The Chinese antediluvian goddess Nü Kwa and her consort Fu Hsi are said to havemolded humans from clay when they descended onto the sacred mountain Hua Shanafter the flood. They taught them how to hunt, fish and cook their catch, theart of writing, and provided the laws necessary for the foundation of acivilized society, while knowledge of agriculture and medicine came from aDivine Farmer by the name of Shennong.[images/00136.jpg]Nü Kua and Fu Hsi, founders of China’s dragon bloodline.Nü Kwa is of central interest to our quest because she is credited withrepairing the sky after Gonggong, a water god with red hair and a tail like aserpent, damaged the pillar supporting the heavens, essentially knocking theEarth's axis off kilter and causing the planet to tilt to the southeast and thesky to the northwest — a story often used to explain why the rivers of Chinagenerally flow to the southeast. The remote period when this cataclysmic eventbefell the Earth is described in the Huainanzi: “Going back to more ancienttimes, the four pillars were broken... Heaven did not completely cover [theEarth]; the Earth did not hold up [Heaven] all the way around [itscircumference]. Fires blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; waterflooded in great expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blamelesspeople; predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, Nü Kwasmelted together five-colored stones in order to patch up the azure sky, cut offthe legs of the great turtle to set them up as the four pillars, killed theblack dragon to provide relief... and piled up reeds and cinders to stop thesurging waters. The azure sky was patched; the four pillars were set up; thesurging waters were drained... blameless people [preserved their] lives.\"24Written in enigmatic style, the book uses allegory to describe how a god withknowledge of earth magic balanced the elements of nature after the heavens fellout of alignment and the sky was punctured with holes, when deep fissures openedin the ground, and entire regions caught fire while others were flooded — a fairpicture of a planet damaged by the impact of a disintegrated meteor. There's nomistaking the prehistoric setting, a time when oversize \"predatory birdssnatched the weak.\"Nü Kwa and Fu Hsi also come from the same sister-brother wife-husband tradition,like Anu and Antu, Zeus and Hera, just to add new names to the ever-growinglist. But there's another revealing aspect to this Chinese pair, they areportrayed as half-snake, half-human, thus shown to herald from the People of theSerpent, setting in motion the divine dynasty of Dragon Emperors in China,ending with the last emperor in 1912. In the Forbidden City it is still possibleto see the Throne of Supreme Harmony featuring seven tier, each commemoratingthe original Seven Sages.Just as the Seven Sages and the People of the Serpent are always associated insome form with the sea, so the dragon was associated in China and Japan withwater. The famous Japanese Dragon King Ryo-Wo was revered as the god of the seaand was said to live in an underwater grand palace called Ryugu, from where hecontrolled the ocean. The association also appears in Korean legends, in whichmortals and dragons are always connected to each other via an intermediaryfish.25Interestingly, while the serpent or dragon was associated with Emperors andwater, the Empress was identified with the phoenix, the bird of resurrection,together painting a vivid symbolism of the rebirth of a divine lineage followingthe flood.VENOM THAT PROLONGS LIFEEarlier we looked at the unusual ability of antediluvian gods to liveoutrageously long lives. The same was true of the People of the Serpent, andthis overlap may reveal how they achieved it. This surreal longevity appears tohave been partly genetic, as though these people originated from an environmentthat differed significantly from the Earth's, much like a citizen of Marsadapting to a planet whose orbit around the Sun is shorter, making a day seemlike an hour. The method was also partly induced. Somehow they found that snakevenom is rendered harmless when mixing with a certain blood type, producing anelixir that boosts the body's immune system and retards the aging of cells, thusextending longevity while creating the illusion of immortality. As strange asthis might seem, Chinese herbalists still use diluted snake venom to prolong theshelf life of food.The relationship between longevity and serpent venom became central to thesymbolism of the Greek god of medicine Asclepius who, legend has it, killed asnake, then watched another slither into the room with a herb in its mouth. Withthis herb Asclepius was able to resurrect the dead snake, putting his healingabilities on par with those of another group of serpents in the east called theNaga priests.THE CULT OF NAGAThe long sovereignty of the People of the Serpent and their influence on humanaffairs covers the regions of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, India, and many Pacificislands, and in every case the sages belonging to this select group are referredto as Naga (serpent).Fijians claim they originated in Central Asia, then migrated to Egypt, andcontinued south to Tanganika before sailing across the Indian and Pacific oceansto their present homeland. A secret initiation called Baki was once practiced inFiji inside walled temple enclosures called naga, the name also given to aseafaring race whose ships resembled serpents. The Fijian civilizing god Degeiarrived on such a canoe from his sunken abode after a ualuvu levu (great flood),landing on the Ra coast of Viti Levu where he built a village at Vuda (origin),and taught agriculture to local people. Degei also acts as the guardian of twocaves on the island said to lead to the Otherworld, a job similarly ascribed toOsiris.[images/00137.jpg]Naga in Indian temple. The seven serpent halos acknowledge the flood Rshis.One Naga progenitor of the royal house of Japan is Izanagi, whose etymologicalconnection to the Itzá makes his name a compound word meaning 'serpentmagician'. According to Japan's prehistoric text Kujiki, he and his sister-wifeItzanami gave birth to the islands of Japan by raising the land out of theocean, or to be geologically correct, when Japan separated from mainland Asia byrising seas at the end of the Younger Dryas to become an archipelago. The Kujikiitself is estimated to have been compiled before the flood, with one document,Takenouchi, describing two sunken landmasses in the Pacific called Miyoi andTamiara, the result of dozens of tenpenchii (cataclysms) that afflicted theEarth due to an imbalance between humans and the divine source.26Incidentally the Takenouchi states that the Five-Colored Peoples (humanity)coexisted for millions of years and only through growing degeneration in societyhave the Yuga cycles (world ages) generated a periodic wiping out ofcivilization.27Naga tradition extends to Viet Nam, where the first person to unite the Champeople of the region and teach them agriculture and medicine was an Empress bythe name Po Nagar. In Laos, the Naga kings were intertwined with water spirits,just as they were in Cambodia. In the legend of Nagi Soma, for example, a princemeets the daughter of the Naga lord of the land — who is half human, half snake— by the seashore, whereupon he marries her and founds a royal race.28 The Nagatradition was maintained for millennia at Angkor, where each year the rulingking united with a symbolic Nagi to recall and revive the prehistoric origins ofthe cult.29 As indeed he should, because a study by John Grigsby of theorientation and position of Angkor's main temples suggests the site is far olderthan the official 12th century founding date. Just as the Giza pyramids modelthe belt of Orion in 10,400 BC, so the main temples of Angkor mirror the coilsof the celestial serpent, the constellation Draco, as it appeared above Cambodiain the same era.30The further you walk away from the heavily visited temples of Angkor and towardoutlying sites such as Phnom Bakheng, the more the anomalies begin to appearpointing to a retrofitting and expansion of an earlier site. Walls damaged byearthquakes and strife reveal megalithic blocks taken from elsewhere to patch upholes. In several cases these blocks look no different to the high precisionmasonry prevalent in Puma Punku, they bear the same precision-drilled holes anda finish that looks as though the stone was poured like cement. What I find mostinteresting is how one wall near this site has partly collapsed, revealingrefined and meticulously fitted megalithic core masonry. Contrary to commonsense, this advanced masonry was subsequently encased by smaller, cruder,comparatively less precise stonework, the kind consistent with the 12th century,the era when the whole 15 square miles of Angkor was allegedly built fromscratch. There is also the curious case of a solitary megalithic block that,stylistically, could have been taken from Puma Punku and dropped here. Or viceversa. It even features the double staircase design common to the Andes thatforms the basis of the chakana or Andean Cross.If you are inclined to walk around Angkor, mark down the number of steps,statues, platforms and carved serpents. You will discover the mathematicalvalues common to the Earth's precessional cycle hard-wired into the fabric ofthe buildings. Like the Great Pyramid, it seems Angkor too has been rebuilt tomaintain the ongoing tradition of knowledge first set down by the antediluviansages.One of the more unusual remarks concerning the Naga comes from the Mahabharataand Vedic Purana texts of India, in which it is said they assumed human formwhen a situation demanded it — such as a global cataclysm, or the necessity formass social reform due to degeneracy in the human race. When describing thedomain of the Naga, the Puranas are specific yet paradoxically vague, probablybecause they tried to conceal their precise whereabouts, compelled as they wereto lead a separate existence. As always, the ocean theme is prevalent. The Nagawould arrive on the seashore, typically in groups of seven led by an eighth:\"Rishi Kashyapa begot the seven great serpents,\"31 thereby revealing the Peopleof the Serpent to be the same as the Seven Sages. Once their mission isaccomplished they return to a land beyond the horizon, to Patalaloka (NetherRegions), somewhere amid the ocean. Hindu mythology describes their capital as asubterranean location called, appropriately enough, Bhogavati (peopled bysnakes).32And yet if their original homeland sank, to where were they returning? Wereportions of their island still remaining after the flood? Are the allusions tounderwater domains mere descriptions of former lands now inundated?The irony is that, for all their efforts risking their lives to bringcivilization to human shores, the Naga race was almost obliterated in India byAryan king Kuru in a massacre at Takshashila, when his clan came to possesstheir land. Just as in Yucatan and the Andes we see the same pattern of groupsof humans turning on the flood heroes or their offspring, even though the Indianaccount appears to have occurred well into historical times. The cliché 'powercorrupts' is an apt observation here, for once humans had been raised from astate of barbarity, some figured out that the only thing better than imitatingthe gods is to usurp power and pretend to be a god.Nevertheless, as with the Shining Ones in Egypt and the People of the Serpent inGuatemala, the Naga bloodline persevered for thousands of years after the floodand into historical times. Naga kings and queens in India ruled over a dozencities throughout the subcontinent, including the northwest of India where theyheld court at Patalpuri, as well as at the aforementioned city of Takshashilla,once home to one of the world's oldest universities. Today, traces of thesePeople of the Serpent can be seen in the symbolic rituals performed by the cultof Shiva and its practitioners, the Naga Sadhu,33 a comforting thought becausethe aim of these ascetics is to become \"well disposed, kind, willing, effectiveor efficient, peaceful, secure, virtuous, honourable, righteous, noble,\"34 inother words, \"a good man or woman who chooses to live on the edge of society tofocus on spiritual perfection\"35 — not unlike the gods who set the example11,000 years ago.There's one further aspect about the People of the Serpent which will take uswest of India and into Mesopotamia and its antediluvian gods. Ninlil,sister-wife of the god Enlil, bore the title Great Mother Serpent of Heaven, andwas appropriately pictured with a serpent's tail.36 It's one of two times whenthe serpent title is raised in Mesopotamia, the other being a Watcher by thename Kâsdejâ, \"who was son of the Serpent named Tabââ'êt.\"37 These magiciansformed a reclusive enclave on a mountaintop somewhere in the Middle East, asettlement by the name Gar-sag,38 where they went by the collective nameAnunaki.Or as they were known throughout India, Annunagi.39"},{"pageContent":"> 13. A MEETING WITH THE LORDS OF ANUAt this point it is worth recalling my conversation with Teokotai Andrew, thewisdom keeper of Tongareva, and how his tribe’s ancestors were the tall,bearded, red-haired Tupenake/Anunaki, \"great sages, star navigators andintelligent human beings\" who originated from an island called Te Pitaka, andhow it sank somewhere in the region of what is now the Arabian Peninsula duringthe great flood.1Inundation maps of this region prove his people's tradition to be generallycorrect. A dramatic rise in sea level 10,600 years ago breached the Straits ofHormuz and caused the fertile plain between Persia and Saudi Arabia to becomewhat today is known as the Persian Gulf.2 That's the equivalent of flooding theBritish Isles.The same situation prevailed along the western coast of the Arabian Peninsula,which became the Red Sea. Sumerian traditions identify this waterway as thegeneral region from where the civilizing flood god Ua-annu once emerged with hisseven sages.3 Given how its earliest name was Sea of Reeds4— Aaru to theEgyptians — it makes for a tantalizing hypothesis, because the K'iche' Maya andthe Olmec refer to one of the points of origin of the antediluvian sages asTolan, the Place of Reeds.MANY GODS, ONE PEOPLEBy now it should be obvious that the Aku Shemsu Hor, the Followers of Horus, theShining Ones, the Hayhuaypanti, the Urukehu, the Huari, the People of theSerpent, the Naga, the Kaanul, the Ofiússa, the Seven Rshi, the Apkallu, and theAnunaki are interchangeable. They are one and the same group of antediluviangods — civilizing flood heroes and magicians sharing the same maritimesymbolism, “fish-men... who worked many miracles” to quote the Popol Vuh,5 allinterconnected by physical description, deeds and ideals, from Iberia to theAtlantic and Yucatan, from Japan and China to Cambodia, from Polynesia andIndonesia to India, and from Egypt to Anatolia and Mesopotamia.The global link completes with the Dogon of Mali, an ancient people of theSahara whose creation myth describes their culture as founded by a group of seaor water people called Nommos. The name means ‘Instructors, Monitors’ — Watchersby any other name. Created by the sky god Amma, the Nommos are described asinhabiting a world orbiting Sirius, from where they descended long ago in avessel pouring thunder and fire; because they required a watery world in whichto live they were subsequently dubbed Gods of Water, not unlike the People ofthe Serpent.6The Dogon inherited a substantial amount of hermetic knowledge from theEgyptians, which might have included the understanding of Sirius and itslesser-known twin star, Sirius B, whose existence was only proved with theadvent of advanced optics in the twentieth century.7 The Dogon ceremonialheaddress, with its extended rays and oblong patterns, resembles the equallyout-of-place katsina costumes of the Hopi, which we’ll discuss later; paintingsdepicting the Nommos with fish tails seem oddly similar to the MesopotamianApkallu, who are themselves depicted with fish tails or as men wrapped in fishskins and wearing distinctive double-stranded beards indicative of their divinerank of office.[images/00138.jpg]Fish symbolism and flood gods: Nommos and U-annu.Just to clarify, Apkallu are not a people but a distinction, a title meaning‘sage’. They are Anunaki (People of Anu), the descendents of Anu, a god of thesky. Let us now examine how they and Mesopotamia fit into the antediluvianpicture.THE MISSING LAND OF THE ANUThe Sumerians believed there once existed a land called Dilmun which theyidentified as the Garden of the Gods. It has been argued that Dilmun was nothingmore than a myth, partly because it was said to be inhabited by immortals, andyet, as we have seen, antediluvian people were attributed with superhuman lifespans that, to any person and their great, great, great, great grandchildren,would make them seem impervious to death. Since it is a view shared by so manydisparate cultures, at the very least we ought to treat the notion as a validobservation, even if it sounds outlandish, because there is plenty ofcircumstantial evidence in support of Dilmun as a physical location.During his tenure as trustee of the British Museum in the late 19th century, SirHenry Rawlinson was perhaps the first to suggest the location of Dilmun to be inmodern-day Bahrain, based partly on the region's Old Mesopotamian name, KarsagDilmun,8 and the plethora of archaeological sites found there which wereconservatively dated to the Bronze Age. Aside from the sites being far too youngto be linked to an antediluvian culture, the theory has a few problems initself, namely that Sumerian texts describe this home of the Anunaki as filledwith groves of cedars and towered by twin mountains, neither of which exist inthe vicinity of Bahrain. In Rawlinston's defence, the Earth was a very differentplace 11,000 years ago, mountains fell and rose in the blink of an eye,landmasses sank, seas became deserts, deserts became seas. Only now aregeologists beginning to grapple with the idea of how a cosmic calamityrearranged the planet beyond recognition.[images/00139.jpg]It must also be emphasized that the Sumerian tradition Rawlinson used forreference was borrowed from older Mesopotamian texts describing events that hadtaken place five thousand years earlier. Given such a span of time,transliterating from a dead language into another would have posed enormousproblems, artefacts are certain to have crept into the texts, in fact theSumerians most likely faced the same obstacles later Greek historians did whentranslating Sumerian and Akkadian into their own language; even in Egypt, mostpeople by 1500 BC had no clue what the hieroglyphs were trying to tell them.That said, in the fourth millennium BC, around the time of Sumer, a peoplecalled Dilmun or Telmun did live around the Persian Gulf, specifically in Qatar,Kuwait, portions of eastern Arabia, and Bahrain.9 One inscription to kingUr-Nanshe of Lagash mentions \"the ships from Dilmun brought him wood as tributefrom foreign lands,\" so clearly neither the ship, its cargo or port of originwere imaginary.10 Could the Dilmun of the Sumerians have been a remnant of anearlier, much disfigured land, the home of the Anunaki? For one thing, evidenceof an intermediate civilization lying between Mesopotamia and India has alreadybeen found in the general area of Bahrain.11Rawlinson's theory was later expanded and refined by Frederich Delitzsch, whobelieved Dilmun to be further east and near the head of the Persian Gulf, by theStraits of Hormuz. I believe he might have been on to something.Like North Africa, Arabia was severely reshaped by events at the close of theYounger Dryas. The fertile plain that existed prior to the creation of thePersian Gulf once supported a sizeable population 75,000 years ago. That allchanged c.9000 BC when the sea at the Gulf of Oman broke through the Straits ofHormuz and drowned much of the region; by 6000 BC the entire area wasunderwater. Archaeologists have turned up evidence of a sudden wave of humansettlement along the shores of the gulf c.5500 BC and, more importantly, theybelieve that precursor civilizations existed yet still lie hidden beneath thewaters. 12There is additional support for this in Mesopotamian legend. It claims how anAnunaki god by the name of Enki founded the antediluvian city of Eridu insouthern Mesopotamia, yet Enki himself was said to originate from Dilmun, a landfilled with springs, and free of disease and death. It was referred to as \"theland from which the Sun rises.\" Assuming this isn't just a metaphor, it placesDilmun east of Bahrain, either near the Straits of Hormuz —as Delitzschspeculated — or further out in the Indian Ocean but now missing.Egyptian papyrus number 1115 may have something to say about this. Stored in theHermitage Museum, this remarkable document details the story of an Egyptiansailor journeying with others down the Red Sea. The ship was caught in a stormin the Indian Ocean, and all but one — the narrator — survived, only to beshipwrecked on an island. At first he believed it to be uninhabited, but in timehe came to meet its ruler, who gave the sailor a new boat and some gifts andsent him home to Egypt. At the farewell, the ruler remarked to the sailor,\"after you depart from this place you will never see it again, for it will turninto waves.\"Although the papyrus itself is more than five thousand years old, the era inwhich the event took place is unknown. What is interesting is how the ruler ofthe island had foreknowledge of its disappearance, so either the story tookplace just before the flood, or the flood had already taken place and the islandwould soon be consumed by rising seas. We can only speculate. However, thedescription of the ruler offers an insight into the kind of people living there,for the sailor describes him as a serpent with blue eyes and a beard. It seemsour shipwrecked sailor inadvertently stumbled upon the island of the People ofthe Serpent — the Annunage, as they were known in India. The unique papyruscomes as close as any document linking the Anunaki to a home somewhere in thevicinity of Arabia or the Indian Ocean. It is worth recalling that the Anunakiwere referred to as Shining Ones — as in Shining Ones, Followers of Horus, andthe Egyptians believed these gods originally sailed from Ta Neterw, the homelandof the gods, which lay to the south, the direction of the Red Sea and the IndianOcean.Mesopotamian accounts contribute a few morsels to this puzzle. They describe theassembly of the Anunaki as being located at the summit of a very tall mountain,and in relation to northern and eastern Arabia the only area that fits such adescription is the peninsula of Musandam, an exclave of the Sultanate of Oman,which juts dramatically into the Persian Gulf to form the lower portion of theStraits of Hormuz. It's a ragged piece of land, ironically still sliding intothe sea, with an interior packed with mountains over 6000 feet in altitude, thehighest in the region by a very long margin. The name of its main city, Khasab,may be a modern corruption of Karsag, the assembly of the Anunaki, but like somany ancient riddles in Arabia it is not known how the small city acquired thisname, or for that matter, its history before the Portuguese built a fort therein the eighteenth century.Teotokai Andrew was right, locating Te Pitaka will prove difficult due to thedrastic rearrangement of terrain following the flood.THE SAGES OF MESOPOTAMIA\"I learned the craft of Adapa the sage, which is the secret knowledge... I amwell acquainted with the signs of heaven and earth... I am enjoying the writingson stones from before the flood.\"13 So spoke Ashurbanipal, 7th century BCSumerian king. What else might the monarch have gleaned from writings that, byhis time, were nine thousand years old?Sumeria's flood myth is widely accepted among scholars as being the source forthe story depicted in the Old Testament, minus the obvious cultural andreligious alterations. The Sumerians in turn inherited theirs from theMesopotamians, the most complete account being the Schoyen Tablet. It beginswith the emergence of humans and animals on Earth. After a frustratingthirty-seven lines of missing text the story resumes in a different era, a timeof high civilization when “kingship was lowered from heaven”14 during anantediluvian period in which an unnamed god “perfected the rites and the exalteddivine laws... founded the five cities... in pure places, called their names,apportioned them as cult centers.” The cities are Eridu, Badtibira, Larak,Sippar and Shuruppak.15 Although they are conventionally dated to c.5400 BC,excavations reveal the foundations of the main temples to have been built muchearlier; for instance, the Eridu ziggurat rests on seventeen previous temples,attesting to these sites having indeed been founded in deep antiquity, exactlyas claimed in the tablets.16[images/00140.jpg]Mesopotamian flood epic. Still a best-seller in 700 BC.After another series of missing lines the story has jumped far into the future,when a pious priest-king by the name Zin-suddu (Life of Long Days) is beingadvised by the god Enki to prepare for “a flood that will sweep over the cultcenters, to destroy the seed of mankind,” due to it having reached a level ofcorruption beyond what was acceptable to the gods.17 Enki instructs Zin-suddu tobury all the tablets in a safe place in the city of Sippar, so that survivors\"may relearn all that the gods had taught them.\"18 What follows is predictable:after being instructed to build a vara (a large enclosed boat), and taking onboard seven Apkallu, Zin-suddu describes the flood overwhelming the cities tothe accompaniment of exceedingly powerful windstorms, and for seven days andnights his mighty ship is tossed about the waters.After yet another frustrating break in the text — the tablets were found damaged— the story picks up with a dazed Zin-suddu standing in the presence of the highgods Enlil and Anu who expresses dismay — and remorse — at the appallingdestruction that has befallen humanity and the Earth. Zin-suddu is theninstructed to return to Sippar, dig up the tablets “and turn them over tomankind.\"19 He does and \"they built cities and erected temples to the gods.\"20A second and parallel flood narrative, Epic of Gilgamesh, provides a little moredetail. The hero Utnapishtim — a descendent of the Apkallu who bore the titleAtrakhasis (Unsurpassed in Wisdom) — is forewarned by Enki, who lives in acube-shaped structure beneath the sea. After the conflagration, Utnapishtim'sship runs aground on Mount Nisir (Mount of Salvation),21 where he is approachedby seven Apkallu and told that they expect the knowledge stored in the tabletspreviously buried in Sippar to survive a future cataclysm. For all his effortsUtnapishtim, like Zin-suddu, is rewarded with immortality.A substantial part of what we know about ancient Mesopotamia comes from Historyof Babylonia compiled by the Chaldean astronomer-priest Belreusu, who wrote hisaccounts from whatever public records and temple archives were still availablein the third century BC, information which, he stated, had been maintained andpreserved for “over 150,000 years.”22 Obviously the Sumerians were verycomfortable with the antiquity they inherited. The accounts describe how thesage Ua-annu — a man of letters and sciences, an architect, temple builder,lawgiver, geometrician, and agriculturalist — brought the civilizing arts tohumans who, in that period, behaved no better than wild beasts. Ua-annu’s fullname and title is Uannadapa, adapa meaning ‘sage, wise',23 the root of adept.Over the course of several thousands of years this sage, who was \"endowed withcomprehensive understanding,\" together with his band of Apkallu — which includedAn-Enlil-da, \"conjurer of the city of Eridu\" — created the antediluvian citiesand formed a great civilization. These people are described as conjurers,magicians, sorcerers, engineers, craftsmen, stonecutters, and masters of “thechemical recipes” and practical magic. The foundations they implemented duringantediluvian times, plus all future renovations of the sites, were attributed totheir knowledge,24 the purpose of which was to establish the plans of heaven onearth.25[images/00141.jpg]Enki with another Anunaki sage.Notice how the Apkallu built civilization before the flood. This Golden Age andits cities were already long established before the events that unfolded at theend of the Younger Dryas, implying these magicians were indeed capable of livingfor hundreds of years. This explains why scholars are at pains to account forthe sudden and fully formed Sumerian civilization — or the Egyptian, or Yucatec,or Andean, for that matter — unless they accept it as the renovation of aprevious endeavor. For example, Sumerian language, like Aymara, is peculiar inthat it is not related to any other world language and yet when it appears itdoes so fully developed.26 Given such comparative idiosyncrasies, whoeverinjected this instant culture heralded from one which developed parallel toordinary humans.Early chroniclers like Belreusu go to great pains to point out that the rise ofSumerian civilization owed everything to the knowledge of the Apkallu. What theybrought to the region was about as perfect as it gets, and the cuneiform textsdescribe in no uncertain terms how, through their intervention, humanityexperienced “exceptional splendor and plenty, the golden age before theflood.”27 The Sumerians were still crowing about Ua-annu thousands of yearsafter the flood: \"There is nothing he brought that has been added by way ofimprovement.\" Together with seven Apkallu he rebuilt the decimated region andprescribed a moral code.28 As his name implies, Ua-annu is one of the People ofAnu.Incidentally, one variant of his name is Ou-anaa, which bears such a closeresemblance to Ouaraa, the ruler of Easter Island c.800 AD, that it makes onewonder just how long the lineage of the Anunaki was maintained throughout thePacific, especially in light of Teotokai Andrew's revelation of the Anunakibeing present in the Cook Islands around 3000 BC.ENOCH MEETS ENMED-URANNA MEETS ENOCHFour miles south of Harran — twenty-six from Göbekli Tepe — lies a permanentsettlement on a mound called Tell Idris dating to c.8000 BC. In the Koran, Idrisis the name given to Enoch, the Hebrew antediluvian prophet andgreat-grandfather of Noah, who is also identified in Islam with the EgyptianTwt, inventor of writing, astronomy and sacred buildings.29 According to 9thcentury Persian philosopher Abu Mashar, Idris — and Enoch and Twt, for thatmatter — may not have been a name but a title, \"its first bearer, who livedbefore the Flood... The Harranians declare his prophethood... He wrote manybooks whose wisdom he preserved on the walls of Egyptian temples lest it belost. It was he who constructed the pyramids.\"30It seems even the Persians believed the pyramids to have been built before theflood by one of the Shining Ones.Enoch's published work, Book of Enoch, was discovered in Ethiopia. Written inGe'ez, the Ethiopian sacred language, it is the most enthralling and unique ofgospels and yet was excluded from the biblical canon, marginalized as anapocryphal work; it also predates the official gospels by at least twocenturies. But before we get deep into the Hebrew version of things, a lesson ingeopolitics.The Babylonians made quite clear their displeasure of the Hebrews, how, duringtheir captivity, they purloined Babylonian accounts concerning the creation, theantediluvian Earth, the flood myth, its hero, and tales of unusual beings calledApkallu or Watchers. Whether we agree with this or not, the point remains thatthe Babylonians themselves received their accounts from the Chaldeans andSumerians, who in turn inherited theirs from remote sources, and by the time theHebrews got their hands on the material, the Babylonians themselves had added afew prejudices of their own. A case of the pot calling the kettle black.Regardless, there is one point of interest. In the Babylonian/Sumeriannarrative, the seventh antediluvian hero is a man of letters who is invited to ahigh location where he receives insights into divine wisdom from two heavenlybeings or gods named Adad and Shamash. This hero Enmed-uranna was also king ofSippar, founder of the guild of bãrûs or diviners, and a recipient ofrevelations — in other words, a wise man or magician, as his surname clearlyindicates.31 (In Sumerian the name means ‘meeting place of heaven’).32The description of Enmed-uranna and his experience — ascent to a mountain,direct contact with the gods in their abode, the dictation of specialistknowledge, the offering of drugs of immortality by the god Anu, the dressing indivine linens, the anointing with oil — is remarkably identical to that ofEnoch's, who is similarly listed in Genesis as the seventh in line from Adam.The 6th century itinerant Nestonian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote an accountduring his travels in the region that juxtaposes, with great precision, theChaldean and Hebrew accounts right down to their respective flood heroesZin-suddu and Noah. Indeed the Mesopotamian traditions provided the model thatbiblical writers deliberately modified, inverted and reinterpreted, with theintent to show off the superiority of Jewish cultural foundations.33Furthermore, as the scholar Amar Annus points out, “Jewish authorssystematically discredited the Mesopotamian primordial sages [apkallu] as theWatchers and Nephilim, while making them part of national history. In Jewishreinterpretation, Mesopotamian antediluvian sages became illegitimate and wickedteachers of humankind.”34There is another name entering the conversation here, the nephilim, and we shallcome to them soon.The Anunaki appear in the Book of Enoch as a-nan-na and its variant a-nun-na.They are sages who live in a settlement called Gar-sag, which Hebrew writerserroneously equated with a heavenly paradise by mistranslating the Akkadiandescription of the settlement as shamu, a 'lofty, walled enclosure', latertransliterated in Persian as paeri-disa. This large compound on the summit ofMount Ardis featured the Building of Knowledge, and a restricted building wherethe Wise Ones — the high assembly of the Lords of Anu — held council. One ofthem, Enlil, was both Lord of the Air and Lord of Cultivation,35 while his wifeNinlil bore the title Nikharsag and was referred to as Serpent Lady.After the Lords of Anu settle on Ardis, several hundred teacher-craftsmen namedWatchers descend and assist in the enterprise. This took place in the days ofJared, father of Enoch, hundreds of years before the flood.36WATCHERS OR ANGELS?Enoch is described as \"a truthful man... writer of the truth,\" a faithful scribewho is trusted enough to be regularly taken to the compound of the Anu, aboardof what can only be described as a flying device that airlifts him to thesummit: \"The men called me. They lifted me up and placed me on what seemed to bea cloud, and this cloud moved, and going upwards I could see the sky around and,still higher, I seemed to be in space. Eventually we landed on the First Havenand there they showed me a very great sea, much bigger than the inland sea whereI lived.\"37 The Greek account from which this is taken describes the vehicle aspneuma (air), so we can deduce Enoch boarded an air-chariot — probably the samehusen-gal (great bird) in which Enlil flew, as described in Sumerian tablets.Enoch is allowed to see the Anu's other abodes, which totalled seven because hedescribes reaching a final, and highest, location called Seventh Haven. Here heaccompanies two guardians whom he describes as messengers,38 otherwise known asWatchers. The original term watcher comes from Aramaic and means ‘to beawake’.39 Later Greek translators used egregoroi, which carries two meanings:'those who watch or guard' and 'those who are awake'. Thus the Watchers areawake or enlightened people performing supervisory roles, exactly as the nameimplies.In the Book of Enoch as well as the Book of Daniel, the Watchers are describedas angels, leading to the misunderstanding they were ethereal beings. Toclarify, the early Greek version calls them aggelos — messengers — and sincehumans observed and interacted with them, they must have been physical people.The Dead Sea Scrolls compiled by the Essenes incorporates all threeinterpretations, stating how “the angels of the Lord descended upon earth —those who are named the Watchers — that they should instruct the children ofmen, that they should do judgment and uprightness upon earth.”40The Watchers were distinguishable from humans insofar as they possessedknowledge of the mechanics of nature and how to manipulate it, thus they werecompared to gods — a view held by the Egyptians, who referred to them as bothUrshu (Watchers) and Neterw (elements of nature or gods).GODS WITH SHINING SKINLike a wide-eyed traveler, Enoch continues walking into the abode of the Anu,accompanied by the Watchers whom he describes as having the appearance of menbut far taller; Sumerian figurines even depict them with elongated heads. Onceinside the assembly he describes how the Lord of Anu, to allay Enoch'strepidation and make him feel at home, asks one of the main Watchers by the nameMika-el to \"strip Enoch of his clothes and anoint him with fine oil, and dresshim like ourselves.\"41The oil had an odor like myrrh and gave the Watchers' skin a lustrous, luminousquality, hence their nickname Elohim, Shining Ones. Enoch further describes themas white or light-skinned — much as the antediluvian gods are describedelsewhere — implying the Anunaki heralded from more northerly or southerlylatitudes. Clearly it was a genetic trait because a later remark by Enoch addsanother layer to their physical description. It is of his grandson Lamech, whosewife gives birth to a son whose body was \"white as snow and red as the bloomingof a rose; and the hair of his head was in long locks which were as white aswool, and his eyes... lighted up the house like the Sun. His father Lamech wasafraid of him... he resembles the sons of the Lord.\"42The implications are tantalizing. For the descendents of Enoch to look like theAnunaki, Enoch himself must have been part of that bloodline, a highly likelyscenario if we recall that Hebrew Enoch is none other than MesopotamianEnmed-uranna, the antediluvian magician-king of Sippar, whose Anu lineage isreflected in his surname.Or did Mrs. Lamech have a fruitful encounter with one of the Anu? Gossipabounds.There is a second point to consider with regard to the Watchers’ physicalappearance. In Enoch's other apocryphal work, Books of Adam and Eve, he mentionshow one couple leaving the enclosure at Gar-sag for the first time, for thevalley below, noticed a change in the substance of their bodies, how living atlower altitude made them appear denser than before.43 Siberian and Iranianpeoples made the same observation, claiming the ancestors were less dense, theirskin was pale or radiant, their hair often white. The Kalmucks and Tibetans ofCentral Asia go so far as to say these peoples’ bodies gave off light to thepoint where they were compared to stars. They lived for hundreds of years, fedby the fruit of a forgotten tree, but the more they associated with the physicalworld the denser they became, and consequently their lifespan shortened toresemble that which humans consider normal. This is a culturally shared notioneven among people in remote places such as Vanuatu in the South Pacific.44One gets the impression the Watchers were humanoid yet not entirely of Earth.Let's return to Enoch's account. He describes the grand assembly of the Anu asconsisting of forty-nine lords overseen by Lord Anu himself. That's seven groupsof seven sages. The four central Watchers of the assembly are \"Mika-el, the kindand patient one; Rapha-el who is responsible for treating illnesses and woundsamong the people here; the third was Gabri-el, and the fourth was Uri-el who isresponsible for dealing with those who are selected to receive an extension totheir normal life-span.\"45 These would become known in the Bible as archangels.[images/00142.jpg]Sumerian figurine depicting Lord Anu himself.Enoch describes how the Watchers/Anunaki were split into groups of seven andgiven responsibility and jurisdiction over an assigned Earthly precinct, toattend to the raising of humans from their primitive state. Each was givenadditional responsibilities and chores while living at Gar-sag: Gabri-el was incharge of the walled enclosure containing the central buildings of the Anu aswell as a special garden from which all manner of fruit trees and shrubs weregrafted to seed places in the lowlands where humans would learn to grow theirown crops. Gabri-el — GBR in its original form, root of the word governor — wasGovernor of paeri-daeza, the garden of the gods, as well as overseer of otherPeople of the Serpent who lived there.46 And here is where the Bible has it allwrong concerning the garden of Eden, upon which this fragment is based: when Eveis talking to a serpent about eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge she isactually talking with Gadre-el, a Serpent person, one of the Watchers living inthe compound at Gar-sag. 47THE LOCATION OF GAR-SAGBut where are Gar-sag and Mount Ardis located? Several writers have attempted toplace it at Mount Hermon in Lebanon, some well reasoned,48 others with a need tojustify the borrowed biblical narrative, after all, the slant given by theHebrews to the Book of Enoch includes shifting the assembly of the Anu from theMiddle East to the Levant in order to justify a religious dogma. However, as faras we know, all the original cities in the region founded by the Anu werelocated in Mesopotamia, well to the east.There is one point worth considering in this argument. Hermon may be atransliteration of Armen, a Watcher who lent his name to Armenia,49 thus it canbe posited that the original assembly of the Anu may have been located along thenorthwestern extremity of Mesopotamia. Enoch himself describes one region of theAnu as highly volcanic, from whose peaks he saw a kind of ocean, which couldfeasibly be the Caspian Sea as seen from the volcanoes of northern Armenia.Enoch further tells us that the assembly was located in a secluded environmenton a tall mountain yet with a climate pleasant enough to grow fruit trees. Onanother journey he appears to be describing a region above the Earth from thevantage point of a space rocket: “I saw that the winds spread out the heights ofheaven, and are stationed between heaven and earth; they are the pillars ofheaven. And I saw the winds which cause the sky to turn and the orb of the sunto revolve, and all the stars.... I saw the paths of the angels; I saw at theends of the earth the firmament of the heavens above.”50It's an account full of paradoxes, yet it is possible that by the time Enoch'swords were compiled the originals were no longer accessible, let alonetranslatable. We are given lots of salivating detail about the home of theAnunaki but, like a missing land, it remains stubbornly out of sight.[images/00143.jpg]Ninlil in council with other Anunaki.In time Enoch receives advance notice of an impending global deluge from theLords of Anu, and how his great-grandson Noah would be further instructed onwhat to do because the event would occur in his lifetime, not Enoch's. The Lordsof Anu clearly had foreknowledge of a danger lurking in the sky, demonstratingtheir proficiency at astronomy, while at the same stroke validating thestatement made earlier about ancient Egyptian sages learning of the great floodtwo hundred years in advance and preparing accordingly by building pyramids andother safe houses to protect the knowledge, to be recovered afterwards byanother group of Shining Ones, the Aku Shemsu Hor.Although everyone was destined to perish, the Lords of Anu promised Enoch therewould be exceptions: \"all the children of men may not perish through all thesecret things which the Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons.\"51THE FALL OF (SOME) WATCHERSHow did the Watchers, who taught the civilizing sciences to humans then returnedafter a global catastrophe to do so again, traits generally associated witheducated and gentle people, become depicted in the Bible as demons? Overlappingtraditions, religious dogma and a smattering of translation errors haveobfuscated the original narrative, so let’s examine the facts in the availablesource material and clarify this important point.Miniature figurines may not seem like supporting evidence, but in this matterthey might just be. Sets of alloy figurines depicting Apkallu were found buriedin the foundations of Mesopotamian buildings as a prevention to ward off evilspirits. Clearly if such apotropaic guardians were protecting people's homesthey could hardly have been terrorists too. The figurines were called massarê,meaning Watchers. The term is applied in Akkadian ritual texts and incantations,just as it is in Aramaic as yryn (wakeful ones), the other term given toguardian Watchers.52 These protective massarê were still employed in the magicaldefence of later Neo-Assyrian palaces, as seen in relief along the walls, evenas free-standing sculptures made of stone or precious metal.53One of the most tantalizing images of an antediluvian Earth appears in the Bookof Giants, a component of the Book of Enoch discovered among the Dead SeaScrolls. It is also, frustratingly, one of the most damaged. The fragments givethe impression of a world populated by ordinary people, and by god-like peopleof very tall stature — the Watchers — who possessed secret knowledge of scienceand the hidden mechanics of nature. It is clear from Enoch's eyewitnessreporting that the Watchers were adamant on maintaining a strict code ofbehavior and a distance between themselves and humans, as instructed by theLords of Anu.The trouble began when a group of two hundred Watchers reneged on this explicitmandate by intervening directly in human affairs. They abandoned their abode atGar-sag to live among humans, teaching secret things to undeveloped,unsophisticated hunter-gatherers which inevitably led to their corruption.54 Thenames of nineteen defectors are recorded in the Book of Enoch, led by “Shemhazah[who] taught spell-binding and the cutting of roots; Hermoni taught theloosening of spells, magic, sorcery and sophistry. Baraqel taught the auguriesof the lightning; Kokabiel taught the auguries of the stars; Zikiel taught theauguries of fire-balls; Arteqif taught the auguries of earth; Simsel taught theauguries of the sun; Sahrel taught the auguries of the moon. And they all beganto reveal the secrets to their [earthly] wives.”55 This may not seem soegregious, but as recent history will attest, even accidental contact withsecluded aboriginal people at a different stage of development can corrupt thetribe's natural evolution and cause irreversible harm. Simply stated, advancedknowledge and inexperience make poor bedfellows.As did taller Watchers with shorter human women. A ringleader by the name Yeqonled a smaller group astray by copulating with such women, who predictably gavebirth to what can only be described as abominations. The Watchers’ progeny werean unfortunate group of misfits called nephilim (giants), who ran amokthroughout the land,56 and while ordinary people did not seem unnerved by theappearance of the Watchers, they were certainly disturbed by the nephilim.Obviously an incompatible genetic pairing existed between Watchers and humans,and explains why so many offspring of the gods in post-diluvial civilizations —kings, queens, pharaohs — interbred for practical reasons.A few renegade Watchers were seduced by Earth and exploited its bounty. Theiradvance knowledge made them arrogant, they pushed the boundaries of their powersby undertaking genetic experiments with animals such as donkeys, asses, goatsand sheep, followed by a program of miscegenation that resulted in monsters,many of which turned on their makers.It is widely accepted among academics that humans mostly foraged for food forthe best part of 300,000 years. The sudden domestication of whole species ofwild animals and plants c.8000 BC is one of the great conundrums of historybecause it played an enormous part in the development of human civilization.Animals and plants became objects of organized agricultural and materialactivity without a known precedent. Is it possible this evolutionary leap isproof of the Watchers’ original experiments, corrected after the greatcleansing? Skeletal remains of wolf, wild boar, auroch, bezoar, moufflon andwild cat have been unearthed in Jericho, the city of giants, buried in aten-thousand-year old sedimentary layer, yet in a layer barely a hundred yearsyounger these species have been replaced with the domesticated dog, cat, pig,sheep, goat and cow — an unprecedented evolutionary leap.Interbreeding with human women led to similar disastrous consequences, theybegat monstrous beings. Lacking wisdom, these offspring barbarians ran amok,killed people for sport, and eventually perished through they own foolishness.This genetic breeding program, with haunting parallels to our present era, isclaimed to have caused great corruption upon the Earth, and numerous world mythsshare the belief that this catastrophic experiment precipitated the cleansing ofthe world. The myths agree that a disintegrating meteor was merely the tool; thecause was the will of the Lords of Anu over the forces of nature combined withthe timing of a near-Earth space object. As the Lord of Anu himself confided inEnoch, '\"the things which you see at rest and in motion were completed by me. Iwill tell you now… what things I created from the non-existent, and what visiblethings from the invisible. Not even to my Watchers have I told my secrets.\"57Yet the Watchers had powers of their own, particularly the gifts of clairvoyanceand telepathy, as exemplified by Mahway, a nephilim of the renegade WatcherBarakel. After a shamanic dream, he reveals to the other renegades their demiseby a flood. The dream was deliberately induced by the Anunaki Ohya, who showsthe giant a stone tablet with all the nephilim names carved upon it, drowned inwater along with the roots of two hundred trees burned by fire. It isinteresting how a frightened Mahway turns to Enoch for an interpretation of thisprophetic vision, placing the scribe in the same time frame. Mahway and hismonsters await Enoch’s advice,58 but all they receive is a confirmation of theirdemise, and hope they repent for their licentiousness, because the land and itshuman victims are crying out, complaining about their misdeeds and the harm theyhave inflicted.59The renegade Watchers crossed the line, and the problem wasn't confined toMesopotamia, it was global. The Wichita of Oklahoma recall in their mythologyhow, before the flood, there existed people with supernatural powers, andthrough their ability to control the forces of nature, death was unknown; somelived to be an extraordinary amount of years. This was one of the things thatled to a terrible imbalance in nature and society. The stories also describe howthe wife of a chief was impregnated and gave birth to four monsters who playedwith other children at first, but as they grew in stature into giants, they tookto violence and other barbaric acts. Such perversions of nature were seen asomens that a reckoning was imminent.60 Legends among the Hopi and Zuni describehow few, if any, of the pregnant human mothers survived giving birth to babieswho emerged the size of grown infants from the womb. Similar stories exist inthe tradition of the Yaghan of Tierra del Fuego.Enoch was brought before the Lords of Anu, at a location undisclosed even to hispeers, to witness the four main Watchers decrying the actions of the renegades:“Asael... has taught wrong-doing, and sins upon the earth, and all manner ofguile in the land; he revealed the eternal mysteries prepared in heaven and madethem known to men, and his abominations the initiates among children of men makefor themselves.”61 For the corruption of humanity with physical perversions, thesharing of restricted information, and the manufacture of weapons, a number ofrenegades were rounded up and imprisoned by Uri-el.62 The leader of the group,Satanail, was incarcerated in one of the desolate penal volcanic regions;another, Azazel, was not so lucky, he was bound hand and foot and tossed into acave, sealed in, and dumped into lava. Although Uri-el and Gabri-el made aconcerted effort to curb the lawlessness, the nephilim abominations were stillout of control. In an emotional appeal to the Lord of Anu, Uri-el expresses hisfrustration, he senses that something is being kept from the other Watchersoverseeing operations at Gar-sag. At this point we discover that the Lord of Anupossessed the power of prediction, for he was aware of the impending globaldisaster, whereupon he instructs Enoch, \"Tell [Noah] from me, 'Hide yourself',and inform him of what is to happen, that all the Lowlands will be destroyed ina flood which will wipe out everything on it. And give him instructions on howhe may escape so that his descendents may be preserved for all time.\"63The Lord of Anu also sends another Watcher, Sariel, to warm Lamech and Noah:“Heal the earth which the Watchers have ruined, and announce the healing of theearth, that I shall heal its wounds and that the children of men shall notaltogether perish on account of the mysteries which the watchers have disclosedand taught.... The whole earth has been devastated by the works of the teachingof Asael.”Meanwhile Gabri-el is instructed to “go to the giants [Nephilim], the bastardoffspring, the children of fornication, and destroy those sons of the Watchersfrom among the sons of men... that they should not expect to live an eternallife, but that each one should live five hundred years”64AFTER THE FLOODAn unspecified period passes after the flood. The groups of Seven Apkullu are nolonger taking part in spreading knowledge, replaced instead by two-third Apkallubeings — part human, part divine.65 Their lineage endured in many royalhouseholds well into historic times, for example, Nebuchadnezzar I, king ofBabylon, described himself as a \"seed preserved from before the flood;\"66 thearchitect of Angkor is described as half human, half divine; the lineage of theAku Shemsu Hor continued into 14th century BC Egypt through Amenhotep III, andhis son Akhenaten.As for the secret knowledge of the Anu and the Apkallu, it was promulgated forthousands of years by new groups of sages, among them the leading Essenes of theQumran community, priests of the Enochian tradition who referred to themselvesas Sons of Light,67 as did the Druid priests of northern Europe.68As for the nephilim, not all were wiped out. According to Genesis, \"Nephilimwere on the Earth in those days — and also afterward — when the sons of God wentto the daughters of humans, and had children by them. They were the heroes ofold, men of renown.\"69 They were still evident c.1300 BC when Israelite scoutsentering Canaan reported \"all the people we saw there are of great size. We sawthe Nephilim there, the descendants of Anak... We seemed like grasshoppers inour own eyes, and we looked the same to them.\"70Perhaps the living giants of the Solomon Islands and other remote places are afaint reminder of this distant and regrettable episode in human history.[images/00144.jpg]The Shining Ones, Followers of Horus.

THE MECHANICS OF A COMET> Disaster, from dis (negation of) astor (a star) Donald Gault and Charles Sonnett, two scientists from the Department ofPlanetary Sciences at the University of Arizona, set out to demonstrate theimpact of a large space rock in the ocean.1 They theorized that the first resultwould be the generation of a large plume of vaporized debris consisting ofseawater, seabed rock, and matter from the meteorite itself. This plume would besucked high into the atmosphere by the reduced barometric pressure created bythe descending projectile.Not surprisingly the release of such titanic energy would generate an equallypowerful and wide circular wall of water, both upwards and outwards, which couldtravel very long distances without loss of energy. The vast amount of energytransferred from a high-speed meteoric impact to a body of water, both in termsof potential and kinetic energy, means the that resulting wave is both extremelytall and speedy.The first wave forced out by the impact would travel at a speed of 397 miles perhour. But that's just the beginning. The original impact site is temporarilyreplaced with a three-mile tall circular wall of water with a base pressure ofsome 3.5 tons per square inch, and highly unstable at that, so when this highpressure water rushes back to fill the hole created by the impact, a secondmassive wave is generated, packing a punch with 60% of the energy of the first.This sobering model is based on a sound understanding of water waves and theformulae which exist for calculating the speed, height and pressure of wavesregardless of whether they are caused by a meteorite, a ship or a duck.2In a nutshell, the height of the first tsunami from a meteorite impact at seawill match the depth of the water at the point of impact. Therefore if fragmentsfrom the disintegrating meteorite of 9700 BC hit deep parts of the Atlantic orPacific oceans, the tsunami generated could potentially have been as much asthree miles high. And even though these projections are extrapolated fromprojectile velocity experiments carried out in a controlled environment, theynevertheless validate oral traditions of waves crossing the Rocky Mountains topenetrate North America or reaching the Himalaya as far as Tibet.Seas rising to cover mountain ranges seems like an improbable proposition,fantastical even, yet there exist many bodies of water far from the ocean or athigh elevation containing salty sea water, and virtually all of them are regionsfrom where flood myths arise. Take the Ararat Massif in Armenia, for example, onwhose slope rests the petrified hull of a massive ship, ostensibly Noah’s ark.3Ararat has been a sacred mountain to Armenians since the dawn of their culture(the name derives from a Sanskrit word meaning 'holy ground'), and the earliestvariant of the name c.3000 BC was Urashtu 4 — an echo of the Egyptian term Urshu(Watcher) perhaps? The mountain's adjacent lakes, Van and Urmia, are both saltwater despite being 5400 feet and 4160 feet above sea level respectively. To thesouthwest lies another mountain range featuring sea-sand beaches — at 7000 feet.To the north there are two large landlocked bodies of water, the Aral andCaspian seas, both of which are salt water and still feature marine life that ismore at home in the ocean, and yet the closest possible inlet is 500 miles away.At 13,000 ft in the Andes, Titicaca is the world’s highest navigable lake andwas once a vast inland salt-water sea, in fact, sea horses still live there. Insouthern Australia, Lake Eyre is a sea salt lake in a basin that is 300 milesfrom the ocean.Are such bodies of water merely examples of coastlines stranded by millions ofyears of uplift, or did their water become contaminated by an incursion of thesea? Because the ability of a high-speed projectile transferring its kineticpower to water is such that it was once capable of generating a wave that tookthe bones of humans, mammoths, sabre-toothed cats and marine animals and dumpedthem on the summit of a mountain deep inland in Vermont.[images/00145.jpg]The Chinese kept meticulous records of comets (top), which they referred to as“vile stars.”It is also worth bearing in mind that the peaks of tsunami are lower as theshockwaves travel through wide open sea, they are merely seen as giant roguewaves, much like the Urukehu experienced on their way to New Zealand when suchwaves capsized one of their waka. Had these navigators been closer to shallowwater they would not have survived to tell the tale, because a tsunami regainsits original height once it reaches shallow water.Is this what motivated ancient people to build temple cities far inland and athigh altitude? Cuzco, 11,000 feet above sea level; Pisac, 10,000 feet; Tiwanaku,12,000 feet; Kura Tawhiti, 3000 feet; Arunachala, 2400 feet, Göbekli Tepe, 2500feet.In Arizona, the Anasazi place of emergence Tuuwanasavi, located at the threemesas, is 6300 feet above sea level, while the Sipapuni of the Hopi is inCanyonlands, whose average altitude is 6000 feet above sea level. It ischaracterized by a mineral dome along the Little Colorado River, below BlackMesa. The site is purely symbolic,5 representing as it does the moment in tribaltradition when the messenger god Masau’u assisted the Hopi at the end of theThird World. One of the lesser-known aspects of this myth is an instruction byMasau’u that the people ought not rest too long in the same location, thatsixteen years is more than ample time to set down roots before becomingcomplacent. Thus Hopi settlements were impermanent. Historians still paint thenomadic movement of such tribes as due to creeping desertification over the pastfour thousand years, necessitating the need to live close to sources of waterwhich, in the desert Southwest, rapidly diminished with climate change. Thismuch is true, however, such an opinion is now contradicted by archaeologicalfinds at Black Mesa that place human habitation there some ten thousand yearsago, proving that migration by native tribes took place within sixteen hundredyears of the flood.6A CRASH COURSE IN COMETSOutwardly the scientific world has doggedly resisted the overwhelming evidencethat the Earth was nearly destroyed by the impact of a fragmenting meteor 11,000years ago and with it whatever high civilization may have once existed. Theyare, however, starting to open up to the possibility that another event of equalmagnitude took place barely one thousand years earlier and triggered the YoungerDryas. In 2007 a team of twenty-five prominent and accredited researchers met atthe American Geophysical Union in Acapulco to cite several inquiries and presentevidence that the Clovis culture — a subjective collective term describing earlyNorth American peoples — vanished suddenly from the historic record due to theimpact of a wayward comet that entered the atmosphere c.10,800 BC, fracturedinto pieces and exploded in giant fireballs, the debris scattering across NorthAmerica — Canada in particular — and Europe.7 It is estimated that while largefragments plunging into the two-mile thick Laurentide Ice Sheet destabilized it,those parts of North America not covered by ice were scorched by wildfires.8 Theeffects were a rise in sea level, extensive biomass burning, megafaunalextinctions, and a cooling of the atmosphere, creating the onset of the YoungerDryas.9Additional research by sixty-three scientists from sixteen countries advocatinga cometary impact theory has now displaced the glacial melt theory as theleading cause of the Younger Dryas. Dozens of peer reviewed scientificpublications from the National Academy of Sciences provide supporting evidence,such as the presence of nanodiamonds and microscopic grains associated withimpact events coinciding with the onset of the Younger Dryas c.10,800 BC.10 Tocompound their claim, studies of 129 core samples from lakes across the worlddemonstrate a clear spike in sediment charcoal levels, evidence that a massburning was in effect on a worldwide scale which consumed around 10 per cent ofthe landmass. The dramatic rise of carbon released into the atmosphere furthercontributed to a sudden drop in temperature.11Undaunted, humans rebuilt. Within three hundred years of the onset of theYounger Dryas cold snap, the Egyptians were celebrating Zep Tepi, a definingevent when everything that was clean, good and wholesome began once more. Itmarked the foundation of temples along the Nile and the whole paraphernalia uponwhich civilization is erected, a point of view shared by the Mesopotamians and anumber of similar cultures.12All this effort would be undone within seven hundred years by a second impactthat closed the Younger Dryas. Around 9645 BC a steep temperature rise of 14º F.took place over a fifty-year period, more disastrous than the most pessimisticdoomsday global warming scenario today and experienced in one lifetime!13 Backedby Greenland ice core data, the mathematician Flavio Barbierro proposed a modelto explain this sudden warming of the climate. Because the Earth behaves like agiant gyroscope, a strike from an asteroid of considerable size, at the rightangle and in the same direction as the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon,could feasibly disturb the planet's torque and shift its spin axis, even if fora brief moment. Since the Earth is also a semi-fluid object — oceans on thesurface and a liquid core inside a liquid lithosphere — a change in centrifugalrotation affects the behavior of its layers, deforming and displacinglandmasses. There would also be a displacement of the poles, forcing the ocean’swater to shift towards the new equator with considerable force, buckling andreshaping the Earth's surface. A change in the mantle establishes the newrotation of the axis in a matter of days or minutes. The consequences would bedevastating. Large parts of the crust would rise and fall, volcanic activitywould increase, titanic earthquakes would be unleashed, accompanied by hurricaneforce winds, torrential rain, wildly fluctuating sea levels, and tidal waveshundreds of feet tall crossing entire continents.14Barbierro's hypothesis neatly accounts for all the descriptions of what tookplace geologically and climatically around the world as recorded in nearly twohundred indigenous traditions.Once again we must ask, could these two events, barely one thousand years apart,be another factor explaining the two separate yet complimentary megalithicbuilding styles found consistently throughout the world?The effect of a large meteor striking the Earth was researched by the Frenchastronomer Pierre Laplante back in 1796, whereupon he reached similarconclusions: “The axes and rotational movement will be changed, the seasforsaking their age-old positions and rushing towards the new equator; most ofthe human race and the beasts of the field will be drowned in this universaldeluge or destroyed by the violent shock imparted to the terrestrial globe,entire species annihilated, every monument to human endeavour overthrown.”15Laplante’s observation was not taken seriously until 1994 when comet ShoemakerLevy arrived from outer space to be captured by Jupiter’s gravitational pull,the pressure of which split the rock into twenty-one fragments that pummelledthe giant planet, causing a plume of debris thousands of miles high. This timeit was Jupiter's turn, the same could have happened to Earth, in fact, DavidLevy, one of the two astronomers after whom the comet is named, went on to stateas much, it is but a question of time.ONE CATACLYSM IS NOT ENOUGHFrom 22,000 BC to 9000 BC alone, the Earth experienced wild climatefluctuations. During that era the most stable habitable region was the territorybetween the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, coincidentally the region wheremost of the oldest megalithic sites are located as well as the aforementionedhomelands of the gods.[images/00146.jpg]Known impact sites and debris fields from first Younger Dryas event.Ancient writers alluded to recurring conflagrations and their words are nowvindicated by geologists and climatologists. As the Egyptian priests onceexplained the capriciousness of life on Earth to Solon: \"In mind you [Greeks]are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancienttradition, nor any science which is hoary with age. And I will tell you why.\"There have been and there will be many and diverse destructions of mankind, ofwhich the greatest are by fire and water, and lesser ones by countless othermeans... For in truth the story that is told in your country [Greece]... has thefashion of a legend, but the truth of it lies in the occurrence of a shifting ofthe bodies in the heavens which move around the earth, and a destruction of thethings on the earth by fierce fire, which recurs over long intervals... Justwhen you and other nations are beginning to be provided with letters and theother requisites of civilized life, after the usual interval, the stream fromheaven, like a pestilence, comes pouring down, and leaves only those of you whoare destitute of letters and education; and so you have to begin again likechildren, and know nothing of what happened in ancient times.\"16Compare the statement with the Mayan Popol Vuh: \"Again there comes ahumiliation, destruction and demolition. The [people of that time] were killedwhen the Heart of the Sky devised a flood for them. A great flood was made; itcame down on the heads of the [people], they were killed, done in by a flood.There came a rain of resin from the sky... the earth was blacked because ofthis; the black rainstorms began, rain all day and rain all night.\"17An Akkadian legend called the Erra Epic was authored by a writer of the periodby the name Kabti-ilani-Marduk, yet he states that he was merely transcribing anold visionary dream recounted by Erra himself. Erra is a god who is roused fromslumber by his advisor Išum and Seven Sages, sons of heaven and earth,\"champions without peer,\" each of whom is assigned a destructive destiny by Anu.However, the narrative is then tainted with a political agenda: these Anunakiare made out to be terrorists whose services Erra hopes to employ in thedestruction of the Babylonians. When the obvious propaganda is removed and theremaining text is read in its original context, an element of astronomy andwarning rises to the surface. The narrative is placed in the mouth of anothergod, Marduk: “Once long ago indeed I grew angry, indeed I left my dwelling, andcaused the deluge. When I left my dwelling, the regulation of heaven and earthdisintegrated. The shaking of heaven meant the positions of the heavenly bodieschanged, and I did not restore them. The quaking of netherworld meant the yieldof the furrow diminished, being thereafter difficult to exploit. The regulationof heaven and earth disintegrating meant underground water diminished, highwater receded.”18 As with other flood narratives, there is a description of theregular order of planets and stars being disrupted by an outside force. Mardukmay have been an astral object, a comet that “left its dwelling” causing the\"regulation of heaven and earth\" to be disintegrated. It was not uncommon in theancient world for astral bodies to be personified and awarded the status of godsbecause they were considered living entities in their own right. Where the abovetext diverges from others lies in its mention of the retreat of aquifers, alongwith the receding of high water, strongly suggesting the oceans suffered aserious drop in sea level as a result of this encounter, whereas comparativeflood myths describe an overabundance of water. What the Erra Epic appears to bedescribing are conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum around 22,000 yearsago, when the Earth experienced a steep drop in aquifers and sea level due tomost of the water being trapped as ice. If so, this prehistoric event iscompatible with the traditions of the Sumerians, who claimed their history hadbeen maintained and preserved for “over 150,000 years.”19ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVENThose great students of the stars, the Chaldeans, were under no illusion thatplanetary orbits are in any way fixed, but undergo periodic change. Writingabout their knowledge, Diodorus of Sicily said, \"Each of the planets, accordingto them has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of timeare subject to change and variation.\"20One such event took place not so long ago. In the Bamboo Books of China it isstated that in the tenth year of the reign of Emperor Kwei c.1578 BC, \"the fiveplanets went out of their courses. In the night, stars fell like rain. The earthshook.\"21 And further along, \"At this time the two suns were seen to battle inthe sky. The five planets were agitated by unusual movements. A part of MountT'ai Shan fell down.\"22The Pawnee describe a time when the Earth's poles switched places, when thesouthern star and the north star swapped positions and that \"when the time comesfor the ending of the world, the stars will again fall to the earth,\"23 an ideashared by Egyptians who once accepted south as up and north as down. Suchdrastic reversals were understood to occur periodically in relation to the GreatYear — the Earth's processional cycle — and were accompanied by greatconflagrations, leading learned people such as Philo of Alexandria and theStoics to comment, \"by reason of the constant and repeated destructions of waterand fire, the later generations did not receive from the former the memory ofthe order and sequence of events.\"24As pointed out earlier, a collision between the Earth and a large projectile iscapable of altering its rotation and, consequently, affecting the way calendarsare calculated. Surprisingly enough, most world calendars were originally basedon a 360-day year and a 30-day lunar month, until the 8th century BC when fivedays began to be added to the solar year, and the lunar calendar was reduced to29 days, thus synchronizing the seasons with current heavenly motions, leadingto speculation that at one time the Earth spun faster on its axis and the Moon'sorbit differed from what it is today.This was certainly the view of Hindu chronology outlined in the Aryabhatiya, anIndian treatise on mathematics and astronomy, in which it is argued that withthe closing of Great Ages and their associated catastrophes, slight differencesin the motions of heavenly bodies come into play.24 The notion was employed bytheir neighbors, the Assyrians and Babylonians, who applied the same numericalvalues in their buildings. The walls of ancient Babylon were 360 furlongs inlength, \"as many as there had been days in the year,\"25 while the Egyptianscomposed their year into 360 days, as did pre-Incan cultures, and the Maya.26The Chinese went a stage further: they divided the sphere into 360 degrees, eachdegree corresponding to the passing of the zodiac over the course of a fullsolar year. When five-and-a-quarter days were added to compensate for theEarth's new rotation, they divided the sphere into the same number, thusharmonizing the new length of solar year with terrestrial geometry.27It seems chaos still ensued in the heavens and on Earth leading up to the 8thcentury BC that forced a reformation of calendars. Addressing the emperor ofChina at the time, the astronomer Y Hang announced that the order of the sky andthe movement of planets had changed sufficiently to make it impossible topredict such things as eclipses, further adding that in earlier times Venusorbited 40º south of the ecliptic and even eclipsed the star Sirius, somethingit does not do today.28Ancient traditions keep reminding us the cause is periodic. All we need do nowif figure out when it is next likely to occur.[images/00147.jpg]Even in 4th century Europe, comets were associated with cataclysms."},{"pageContent":"> 15. MISSING COASTS> > \"If you examine [ancient Egyptian] art on the spot, you will find that ten> thousand years ago (and I'm not speaking loosely, I mean literally ten> thousand), paintings and reliefs were produced that are no better and no worse> than those of today.\" — Plato1When caliph Al-Ma'mun attempted to force his way into the Great Pyramid in theninth century, one of his priorities was to find maps of the world, said to havebeen deposited there by Twt, whose accuracy once allowed the gods to moveunhindered about the planet. It is not known if he succeeded, but a number ofanomalous maps subsequently surfaced around the Mediterranean showing islands,continents and other features yet to be discovered at the time, or no longerexisted.One such map appears in Mundus Subterraneus, a geological opus compiled in 1684by Athanasius Kircher, a scholar and polymath who's been compared to Leonardo daVinci. It depicts the island continent of Atlantis prominently in the middle ofthe Atlantic Ocean; Kirchner claimed the map was based on Plato's works alongwith five pages from additional sources including rare Egyptian accounts. Theresult is a map of the Atlantic oriented with south at the top, with America tothe right instead of left, Africa and Iberia to the left instead of right and,on the island of Atlantis itself, a compass pointing south instead of north.[images/00148.jpg]Kirscher's map of Atlantis with north as south.The thing is, Egyptians once considered south to be north, while the Hopi andother ancient commentators claim a rapid movement of the poles did occur inremote times and led to an ice age. In his studies of the Indian sacred bookMahabharata, the scholar Lokamanya Yilak points out that “the Earth’s magneticfield is tied up in some way with the rotation of the planet. And this leads toa remarkable finding about the earth’s rotation itself... the axis has changedalso. In other words, the planet has rolled about, changing the location of thegeographical poles.”2 Coincidentally, the last known geomagnetic reversalcompleted around 10,400 BC.3In addition to a sudden pole shift, in 1837 Louis Agassiz proposed a hypothesisthat the Earth's crust once suffered a major displacement, an idea that onlygained traction in the late twentieth century, and with some merit. The planet'srotation and tilt have clearly been a factor, even a trigger of sudden glacialepochs. Einstein himself once considered the uneven distribution of ice at thepoles to be capable of destabilizing the Earth through centrifugal momentumcausing a slippage of its top-most skin, which is barely 30-miles thick andrests over a lubricating layer. Theoretically this would cause the polar regionsto slide to the equator. In such an event the Sun would indeed be seen to riseand set in completely different parts of the sky, in contrast to its presenteast-west trajectory. This scenario might have taken place between 14,500–12,500BC, with aftershocks up to about 9500 BC.4Antarctica is a good example of crustal displacement. A map of this snowboundlandmass created by French geographer Orance Fine in 1531 uses sophisticated mapprojection and spherical trigonometry accurate enough to allow fifty points ofreference to be located today. The problem is, the map was drawn three centuriesbefore said continent was discovered.5 Another anomalous map by Philippe Buacheaccurately shows Antarctica's sub-glacial topography, an extraordinary leap ofimagination considering the last time the south pole was ice-free is estimatedat 14 million years ago.6 Or is academia wrong? Certainly Antarctica was once2000 miles further north — where the capital of Chile is today — ice free, withonly a small portion of its landmass inside the Antarctic circle; Queen MaudLand in particular would have been a most agreeable place for agriculture and adeveloping island civilization. There is also evidence that sediment-carryingrivers were still active in the Ross Sea as late as 4000 BC,7 so clearlyAntarctica has not been as snowbound as we might believe. The only thing we canbe certain about this continent is that much of what we know is uncertain.[images/00149.jpg]Buache shows Antarctica as two islands, just as it appears beneath the ice.Adding weight to the crustal displacement theory is the 1513 map of Turkishadmiral Piri Reis, collated from twenty different ancient source documents, andshowing the coastlines of South America and Africa with a high degree ofaccuracy, even the remote Falkland Islands are located with pinpoint precision.It correctly depicts the Amazon River and its source, yet in the sixteenthcentury all this had yet to be located or explored by westerners. The largeisland of Marajo, which ought to appear at the mouth of the Amazon, is missing,leading to the conclusion that the source map was made around 13,000 BC whensaid island was still part of the mainland. But more importantly, Queen MaudLand is depicted free of ice, a situation that only occurred before 4000 BC. Themap also shows a large landmass over the sub-oceanic Mid Atlantic ridge, 500miles to the east of Brazil and just north of the equator. Due to rising sealevels, only fifteen pinnacles of rock remain above the water today,collectively named the Rocks of Peter and Paul.Not only does the Piri Reis map depict the Earth’s landmass prior to majorgeological changes and upheavals, its unusual projection is based on an ancientastronomical observatory centered on the Nile island of Elephantine, onceEgypt’s legendary southern border. This was validated by the US Air Force.However, on the Piri Reis map the island is not located north of the equator buttwo thousand miles to the south, in present-day Tanzania. The US Air Forceoffice was similarly impressed by the ability of this 16th century cartographerto have projected his map as though from space. Since the map is based onextremely ancient sources, it follows that the original cartographer must haveknown the Earth to be spherical.We are regularly told the Greeks were the first to figure out the Earth wasround and yet the Avestans before them were certainly aware of the existence ofthe poles by the time they wrote the Mahabharata, for they describe the ArcticCircle as a place where “the stars, the moon and the sun are only once a yearseen to rise and set, and a year seems only as a day.”8 An Icelander readingthis passage would see an accurate description of the behavior of the sky atextreme northern latitudes. The text is conservatively dated to 800 BC buteastern scholars claim it too is a copy based on extremely ancient sources, likeso many other texts of the Indian region. Even Pliny knew the sphericalattributes of the Earth when he noted in 79 AD, \"Human beings are distributedall around the earth and stand with their feet pointing toward each other....Another marvel, that the earth herself hangs suspended and does not fall andcarry us with it.\"9Maps, it seems, are a remarkably reliable method of recording what exists aswell as what no longer does.[images/00150.jpg]Ben Zara’s map still shows glaciers in Europe and a river along the Sahara.In historical times it was commonplace for seafarers around the Mediterraneanto copy maps without realizing the source documents recorded landmasses nolonger extant. For example, a map drawn in 1487 by Yehudi Ibn Ben Zara depictsglaciers further south than Sweden, and what the coastlines of theMediterranean, Adriatic and Aegean seas might have looked like before themelting of Europe’s ice caps following the end of the Younger Dryas.10 It alsoshows a substantial river running east to west in the middle of the Saharaemptying into the Atlantic Ocean, yet no such river existed in Ben Zara's time,only though satellite imagery has this hitherto unknown body of water beenlocated beneath the sand. The desertification of northern Africa began around9700 BC due to a change in the Earth’s orbit and interplay with changes inatmosphere, sea levels and sea ice,11 with the region between Egypt and the westcoast of Africa finally succumbing to desert by 3000 BC. Thus Ben Zara's sourcemap must have been created when the river was still in full flow, which againtakes us to around the time of the Younger Dryas.12REBUILDING THE FORMER HOME OF THE GODSThe Apkallu were said to have arrived in Mesopotamia from their residence inApsû (Ocean of Wisdom or deepwater abode) until the god Marduk — who isperceived as an errant celestial object — forced them to retreat to the safetyof this location during the flood, so clearly this is not a metaphorical orotherworldly environment but a physical location — quite possibly Te Pitaka, themissing land of the Anunaki described in the Tongarevan tradition.There is a parallel to this account in the Building Texts, where “the homelandof the Primeval Ones” is identified as an island in the ocean, home to aprosperous civilization whose survivors set out in ships, re-settling in anumber of locations to \"rebuild the former world of the gods.”13 The BuildingTexts make it clear that 12,000 years ago there were two races on Earth:hunter-gatherers with little knowledge of civilization, and an altogetherdifferent race of people who lived remotely, far more advanced in engineering,metallurgy, large-scale architecture, natural magic, civic cohesion andnavigation. And perhaps in technology too, because there is an odd passagedescribing how the source of light on Ta Neterw came from a Sound Eye, alludingto a device by which the entire island was artificially illuminated. It too wasdestroyed by the great flood, causing darkness to fall on the domain of thegods.14[images/00151.jpg]A small section of the Building Texts. Edfu.The late English scholar Eve Reymond published an incisive study of the BuildingTexts that reveals much about the origin and home of the antediluvian gods ofEgypt. To read them is to travel to a bygone era of high civilization, ofsurvival and new hope, to place yourself front and center of a rebuildingproject that attempted to revive a destroyed wonderworld. One can almost tastethe bittersweet endeavor as the texts describe a period in prehistoric timescalled the Early Primeval Age of the Gods, in which we find the ancestors of theancient Egyptians arriving from the Home of the Primeval Ones, a sacred islandamidst a great ocean where “the earliest mansions of the gods” were founded.15These gods were accomplished sailors who traversed the seas, but when ameteorite and a flood destroyed their island, “companies of gods” lucky enoughto be caught at sea survived. The texts describe the calamity as \"the greatleaping snake pierced the domain of the gods,\" eerily reminiscent of the Waitahadescription of a comet and its tail, \"Auahi Tu Roa [Firebird] who carriesmessages across the darkened skies for the Sky Father.” Upon sailing back to seewhat remained of their homeland, all the gods saw were reeds and mud that madethe sea impassible to navigation and hindered further exploration.16 Reluctantlythe group wandered the world as the “crew of the Falcon” in search of suitablelocations where they might recreate their former home;17 chief among this groupof wandering gods was Hor and Twt.When Diodorus was compiling his history of Egypt, informants told him that thedecision by the gods to rebuild there was due to southern Egypt’s geographicaladvantage in a period marked by extreme cold and the absence of sunlight. Closeto the equator, conditions were warmer and humid, and the extra rainfallfollowing the flood benefitted this region well as an ideal place for theregeneration of new forms of life.18Each of the gods were assigned specific tasks: the Shebtiw possessed the abilityto “enbue with power the substances of the earth”, they could “magnify things”and provide magical protection through the careful use of symbols and words; asecond group, the Builder Gods, were in charge of constructing sacredarchitecture “according to what the Sages of the primeval age revealed to Twt”;then there were the Seven Sages, Followers of Horus, each an expert in theirfield, whose knowledge was superior even to that of Twt.19 We may as well bedescribing the Lords of Anu, the Anunaki or the Watchers.But where exactly was their original land? The Egyptians believed Ta-Neterw layto the south — assuming that in the period being described south meant south,not north — a maritime land across a large expanse of water that could only bereached by boat; on occasion the gods would invite a human there to see it. Partof it was still in existence during Zep Tepi, when the territorial reign of thegod Ra gave rise to a golden age which later Egyptian cultures looked upon withgreat fondness and regret, since it was \"a time of truth that came down from thesky and united with those who were here on Earth. The land was in abundance,bodies were full, there was no year of hunger in the Two Lands. Walls did notfall, thorns did not pierce in the time of the Primeval Gods.\"20 It is describedas an Island of Fire, “a mystic land of origin beyond the horizon,” presided byHor; it was also the abode of Twt, where he “made shrines for the gods andgoddesses,” validating it as a real location, least of all because the Egyptiansrecorded its name as Ta-Ur, land of the old city’.21The island is described as \"intersected by canals filled with running water,which caused them to be always green and fertile. On these grew luxuriant cropsof wheat and barley, the like of which were unknown to earth. The Papyrus of Nusays that ”the wheat grew to a height of five cubits, the ears being two cubitslong and the stalks three; the barley grew to a height of seven cubits, the earsbeing three cubits long and the stalks four. Here lived the spirits of theblessed dead, who were nine cubits high, and the reaping of these crops was, itseems, reserved for them, and for the Souls of the East.”22Such a description of abnormally large crops is strangely similar to the wayViracocha and his Shining Ones potentized the water in and around the Qorikanchain Cuzco that made vegetation grow to extravagant height.The deciphering of the Building Texts soon revealed they did not originate atthe temple of Edfu, they are a synopsis of an ancient and vast archive ofmaterial that fell prey to millennia of political and environmental caprice. Ithas to be remembered that when explorers reached the site in the earlynineteenth century, its once grand interior was being used as a storehouse foranimals and corn. Vast amounts of rubbish were piled in and around the site, andstate rooms had been turned into sleeping quarters and kitchens, while campfireslit inside the buildings led to the fine, painted hieroglyphs being covered inthick layers of soot. An architectural wonder had been transformed into a hovel.It was wise of the Greek restorers in the 3rd century BC to physically carve theinformation onto the walls of Edfu lest the knowledge of the origins of the godsbe lost — especially as the Building Texts state how they constitute nothingless than “the words of the Sages... the only divine beings who knew how thetemples and sacred places were created,” for they were the very creators of thatknowledge.23 They dictated it to Twt who compiled it into a number of books, alllost for the time being: Sacred Book of the Temples, Book for Planning theTemple, Sacred Book of the Early Primeval Ones, and Sacred Book of Atum. Anotherwork, Specifications of the Mounds of the Early Primeval Age, contained themaster plan upon which Egypt was to be laid out, including an inventory of allthe original mounds upon which the historical temples would be built, all partof the plan to resurrect the former age of the gods during and following theYounger Dryas.A CONTINENT HIDDEN BEHIND A MURALTwt’s tomes were not the only ones to be concealed. At some point in the earlyeleventh century, an archive of up to 50,000 documents was sealed up in achamber inside one of the caves of Mogao (Peerless), part of a system of 492temples located in a remote corner of northwestern China.[images/00152.jpg]The entrance to Mogau caves today. Below: The mural in Cave 16 in 1921.[images/00153.jpg]The nearby city of Dunhuang was once a strategic religious and trading pointalong the Silk Road, and in time the site became a major Buddhist place ofveneration, with over 1000 caves used for meditation, each elaborately paintedand filled with statues, reliefs and other objects used as visualrepresentations of the quest for enlightenment. The entrance to what is nowreferred as the Library Cave was further concealed behind a wall painting. Ninehundred years later, visiting Daoist monk Wang Yuanhu wondered what lay hiddenbehind the mural, and upon discovering the cache of historical, mathematical andfolkloric texts written in a dozen languages including Old Uyghur, Tangut, earlyTibetan, Sanskrit, and the undeciphered Nam language, he appointed himselfguardian of the cave temples.[images/00154.jpg]Wang Yuanhu at Dunhuang.The first Western expedition to reach Dunhuang arrived in 1879, followed twodecades later by French explorer Paul Pelliot, who took to the daunting task ofsorting and arranging the endless sea of documents, as he graphicallyillustrates in his letter: “During the first ten days I attacked nearly athousand scrolls a day.” News of the cache reached John MacMillan Brown,philologist and Chancellor of the University of New Zealand, who took tostudying whatever texts were made available outside China. Something must haveimpressed him because, soon after, he became a leading western advocate for alost continent in the Pacific. Like the 16th century European navigatorscollecting stories from island to island, he too remarked that today's Pacificislands are the remnants of an older root civilization, a theory he based uponexamination of certain texts from the Mogao caves written in a lost language,Tocharish, which included a map of the original Pacific detailing the locationof a missing landmass.Frustratingly, the map has vanished along with the texts MacMillan wasreviewing.THE HOPI OF MUIAThe trail picks up with the Hopi, who refer to their original homeland as Muia,an island in the Pacific lost to a global catastrophe. “Those people who gothere, the flood destroyed most of them but a few survived. They were the remnantof something big... But these Hopi people know that they came from across theocean and migrated here,” recalls Homer Cooyama Kykotamovi of the Hopi Coyoteclan.24 A long time ago the ancestors of the Hopi were seafarers whose oraltradition included descriptions of this land, knowledge of which is typicallytransmitted to initiates during coming-of-age ceremonies. Bamboo and reeds areused throughout creation myth and storytelling in the kivas, plants totallyout-of-place in the arid desert landscape of Arizona.This missing land in the Pacific is emphasized in Samoan tradition, where it isstill referred to as Mu, the Mu’ul of the Olmec. During his time in Tibet, PaulSchliemann, grandson of the noted archaeologist, came across a Chaldean text ina Buddhist temple in Lhasa, written approximately 4000 years ago, in which theisland’s final days are recounted: \"When the star Bal fell on the place where isnow only sea and sky the Seven Cities with their Golden Gates and TransparentTemples quivered and shook like the leaves of a tree in storm. And behold aflood of fire and smoke arose from the palaces. Agony and cries of the multitudefilled the air. They sought refuge in their temples and citadels. And the wiseMu, the hieratic of Ra-Mu, arose and said to them: 'Did not I predict all this?'And the women and the men in their precious stones and shining garmentslamented: 'Mu, save us.' And Mu replied: 'You shall die together with yourslaves and your riches and from your ashes will arise new nations... The landand its inhabitants were torn to pieces and swallowed by the depths in a fewmonths.\"25Funny how the essence of the Egyptian god Ra is sprinkled throughout the Pacificas much as its islands — places such as Ra-Iatea in Fiji, literally 'whiteskinned people of Ra'.Other Polynesian people refer to this lost land as Hava-Iki, which in time hasbeen shortened to Hiva. According to Hawaii folklore the gods created an idealland for the first humans in Kahiki-homua-kele, once situated along the presentHawaiian chain of islands but since submerged, which ties in perfectly with theisland's tectonic record, and perhaps why the translation of this lost paradiseis The Land That Moved Off. Survivors became forest-dwelling races such as theNawao, large-sized hunters descended from Lua-nu’u, the Mu people, and the Wapeople.26 Another Hawaii tradition states that during the Era-of-Overturning,the people's homeland was called Hoahoamaitru. There, a man by the name of Nu'ubuilt a big boat in which to survive the flood whose waters overflowed the landexcept for the Hawaiian peak of Mauna Kea.27Academia loves to trash the idea of the missing continent of Mu as much as theydo Atlantis. They particularly direct they scorn at the one person who expoundedthe idea in the late nineteenth century, James Churchward, but regardless howmuch of Churchward's work is pure research or conjecture, the fact remains thatjust about every Pacific culture validates the existence of this land,regardless of what it was originally called. During his time and travels inIndia and Burma, Churchward was informed by the Naacal, an elevated class ofpriests and wisdom keepers who originated from said lost continent some 15,000years ago. Much of their information, which includes detailed and accuratedescriptions of how the cosmos and the earth works, millennia before NASA, waswritten in symbolic form on hundreds of clay tablets which Burmese priests claimhave been systematically looted from their temples. That's quite a long time tohold a grudge. Among the symbols is the seven-headed serpent representing theformative aspects of nature and the seven Serpent People who once taught them,as written in religious texts such as the Hindu Manava Dharma Sastra, the RgVeda, and the Nahuatl teachings of Yucatan, with the most scientific of textsfound among the Marquesans. The language in which they were written was calledNaga-Maya, whose closest translation is serpent-water. Given what is known aboutthe People of the Serpent and their relationship to water places thequackademics on a back foot, to quote the late John Anthony West.The Ramayana goes so far as to describe the Naacal priests as Maya adepts,“starting from the land of their birth in the east, as missionaries of religionand learning, went to Burma and there taught the Nagas. From Burma they went tothe Deccan in India, whence they carried their religion and learning toBabylonia and to Egypt.\"28 This is somewhat validated in the Troano Codex, thewritten accounts of the Maya during the Spanish invasion, where Mu is referencedusing the same symbols found in India and Burma. One script in a temple at Uxmalconfirms \"the lands of the west from where we came... that land of Kui...birthplace of our sacred mysteries.\" A stela in the temple of Akab Dzib inChichen Itzá likewise describes the lands of the West being shaken to theirfoundations by earthquakes before being engulfed by the flood. The TroanoManuscript fixes the date of cataclysm at 9937 BC, remarkably close to theYounger Dryas boundary, and further states that the dominant race waslight-skinned, great navigators and sailors, learned architects, and builders ofgreat temples in stone.29 The Codex Cortesianus picks up the narrative: \"Mu, thecountry of the hills of earth, was submerged... The place of the dead ruler isnow lifeless, it moves no more, after having twice jumped from itsfoundations... the king of the deep, while forcing his way out, has shaken it upand down, has killed it, has submerged it... Twice Mu jumped from herfoundations; it was then sacrificed by fire... By kicking it, the wizard thatmakes all things move... sacrificed it that very night.\"30In describing this missing land as “having twice jumped from its foundations,”the account tallies with the two geological upheavals marking the start andclose of the Younger Dryas."},{"pageContent":"> 16. STAR PEOPLEFour-thirty a.m. is the perfect time to go for a walk, even if, like me, you’renot a morning person. Just before sunrise, the desert is the quietest place onEarth. I like the desert, it is a place to find answers, to bring closure. Asthe song goes, “in the desert you can remember your name.”The meeting point of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona has always felt like a secondhome to me — along with Kura Tawhiti in New Zealand and Luxor in Egypt — evenback when I was a wee nipper living in Europe. Although I’ve made severaljourneys to this region, the one place I desired to experience above all was apanel of petroglyphs in one of its most remote canyons, requiring a seven-hourhike, typically in 100º heat, while carrying a backpack 90% stuffed with water.The images on the panel are like no other. Painted in red ochre, the sevenfigures stand over seven feet tall, draped in long tunics, with a central eighthwhose eyes stare with a self-assured alertness. These people look nothing likethe Hopi or Zuni, they belong to another time and place, and it’s probably forthis reason that the frieze has been inappropriately labelled the Ghost Panel.Before departing on the trek into Horseshoe Canyon I discussed the panel and itsfigures with Zuni elder, Clifford Mahooty, a man never short of fascinatingstories about Native American tribespeople and their traditions. My quest was aspersonal as it was exploratory, I wished to learn more about the part theseancient people might have played in the flood narrative and the gods whofacilitated their appearance in North America, after all, people are known tohave been present in this canyon since 9000 BC. Clifford was attentive at myobvious passion to come face-to-face with the cloaked figures. “I feel asthought I’ve known them for a long time, “ I said, “they seem awfully familiar,even with the gowns draped down to their feet.”Clifford gave me a puzzled look. “But you do know who they are, you’ve comeacross them before. We call them Lookers.”THE FOUR WORLDS OF NATIVE AMERICAAccording to Hopi tradition the First World, Tokpela, was destroyed by a fire ofglobal proportion.1In the Second World, Tokpa, the Earth bore little resemblance to the previousone. Where there had been land now there was water and vice versa. This periodcame to a close when the poles spun out of control and the world \"rolled overtwice... it froze into solid ice,\" a remarkably good fit with the period of theOlder Dryas.2 The Earth turned on its axis, north became south — the Hopidescribe it as “south-facing world” — the consequence of which was an ice age.Members of the Hopi were warned in advance and instructed to follow a cloud ofunusual shape by day and a moving star by night that led them to a mound of theAnt People. Once safely inside, the Hopi lived underground until conditionsallowed them to return to the surface.3In the Third World — the one we are immediately concerned with, the period ofthe Younger Dryas — the population grew rapidly and achieved remarkableprogress, building cities and a world civilization.4 Although many people livedin harmony with nature and the spirit world, there developed a parallel andtechnologically advanced society that used its creative power unwisely whichultimately led to wars. They built “flying shields,” aerial craft capable oftraveling quickly to different places in the world to devastate entire cities.5As expected, this did not sit well with the creator gods, whereupon they decidedthe world must be destroyed yet again, this time by a great flood, and recreatedfrom scratch. Predictably, instructions were sent out to place selected peopleon boats — “inside tall plants with hollow stems,\" was the expression.6When the survivors emerged they were shocked to see the great landmass wherethey’d once lived reduced to the top of a tall mountain surrounded by water,lots of water. They took to boats and sailed from island to island, the remainsof former lands, slowly migrating eastwards and slightly to the north. The Hopinarrative states how they finally reached a large, flat island, covered withtrees and plants, settling there for a short time before being ushered to NorthAmerica, presumably due to ever rising seas. Upon reaching a mountainous region,they paddled upstream through deep canyons, searching for the Place ofEmergence, which they eventually found. From a high elevation they looked westand south and saw the islands from whence they'd migrated, the tips of mountainswhere once a landmass had been. They were now living in this, the Fourth World.8The Place of Emergence refers to a symbolic mound at the base of the GrandCanyon. However, the Hopi suggest the description of the labyrinthine journeytaken up the Colorado River to this site is an allegorical representation of thejourney as a whole, for the mound itself is far too young to be the original —the level of the river 11,000 years ago was much higher than it is today, themound would have been submerged. Hopi tradition claims the true Place ofEmergence lies \"down below\" in Central America, which the ancestors reachedafter the mother continent, Kásskara, sank in the central Pacific at the sametime as another in the Atlantic by the name Talawaitichqua, the Atitlán of theItz. Kásskara is said to have covered a fair portion of the central Pacificsouth of the equator.9[images/00155.jpg]Katcina dance, c.1900. Note the painted white face. If this commemorates anancient event, who is the white person representing?A messenger god by the name Massau’u was instructed to stay with the Hopi andoversee the initial settlement and the migrations that would follow. An amalgamof legends depict this individual as a decrepit old man of grey complexionconcealing a younger, robust man who lives somewhat remotely among the tribe towhom he gifts knowledge written on stone tablets. Masau’u possesses the power offlight, the ability to traverse vast expanses of territory as though superhuman,and to interact between worlds. In many respects he acts as an observer, aLooker.10 Could his name be related to Mâsu, the name of the mountain in theEpic of Gilgamesh where the seven Apkallu alighted after the flood, and one ofthe oldest names of Mount Ararat, the resting place of the ark according to theBible? 11OF RED ANTS AND ANUNAKIOne fascinating aspect of the Hopi tradition is their vivid recollection ofhelpful outsiders, especially at times of extreme crisis, the most alluringbeing the Ant People. What on earth possessed the Hopi to describe them thisway?The Ant People are associated with the color red, but whether this is purelysymbolic or descriptive of a physical characteristic, such as red hair, is notknown for certain. However, red Ant People are also central to Maya legends,which link them to the building of temple cities, and saqbe, thoseruler-straight spirit roads, all of which took place during the time of FirstCreation. The traditions of Central America state how the red Ant Peoplepossessed magical powers which enabled them to control the laws of nature, andhow they used sound to move and raise megaliths to create stupendous temples inthe course of a single night. The Yucatec called them Chac Zay Uincob (Red AntMen) because they labored to create order in nature, just as industrious redants do.12To the Maya and Hopi, Red Ant People were linked with Orion, specifically itsbelt, whose central stars are regarded as the tripartite body of an ant. Butit’s their terrestrial link that reveals their place in the list of antediluviangods, specifically a group in the Middle East, for the Hopi word for ant isaanu, while the word nàaki means reddish yellow sand; the derivative naakwatsimmeans 'friend'. One variation, aanu-nàa-kii, literally means 'ant-father-home'.Whichever interpretation one cares to pick, the overall description is of fatherfigures bearing a complexion akin to reddish-yellow sand, or who originate froma sandy environment, such as the Middle East. And it gets better. The offspringof the Anunaki are described as nemalah, an old Hebrew term for ant. 13The Hopi recall the leader of the Ant People as an individual by the nameAnu-Sinom (ant man or being). In the legend, this unusual humanoid is describedas generous and hardworking, willing to provide food to the people and teachthem methods of food preservation so they could ride out the prolonged upheavaltaking place outside their protective cave.14 This is not as far fetched as itmay seem because vast man-made cave systems exist throughout the world. Oneexcellent example, Derinkuyu, lies two hundred miles west of Göbekli Tepe andonce comfortably housed 20,000 people while they patiently waited outcatastrophes caused primarily by mass coronal ejections.15WATCHING THE KATSINAStraddling the Arizona-New Mexico border are another ancient and equallyfascinating people, the Zuni. Just like Sumerian and Aymara, Zuni language isnot related to any other, it appears to have been invented, a designed languagespoken for at least 7000 years. It also contains a high proportion of Japanesewords. Zuni and Japanese people share the same frequency of Type B blood as wellas near-identical flood traditions, the only difference being that the Zunicategorically state they arrived in North America from a sunken land somewherein the Pacific.Ant People also feature prominently in Zuni tradition; an excellent life-sizedepiction of them is painted in red ochre on a wall in Sego Canyon, Utah, a farless strenuous trek than Horseshoe Canyon. They are credited with helping thepeople relocate after the flood to the region around modern-day Zuni village;the Zuni even have a term of endearment for them — Lookers.16[images/00156.jpg]Seen together, these katcina dolls and Zuni masks of gods and goddesses offer avivid, if stylistic portrait of the Red Ant People.There’s a sensational observation in the tradition. It turns out the Zuni gavethem the sobriquet Ant People because of the antennae sticking out of theirhelmets.17If you find antennae and helmets out of place in the desert southwest thenyou’ll love the unusual dancers called katsinam, a Hopi collective term for‘spirit beings’, although the phrase isn’t limited to an ethereal entity, as onemight expect. The Navajo consider katsinam to be real beings with a moredeveloped mystical outlook, to whom they refer as Air-Spirit People: \"They areunlike five-fingered earth-surface people who come into the world today, live onthe ground a while, die at a ripe old age, and then leave the world. They arepeople who travel in the air and fly swiftly like the wind.\"18Certainly it’s an odd choice of word because the syllable ka is not native toHopi, it appears to have been imported from a visiting Egyptian, it is the wordfor ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’. The etymological root of katsina is speculative yetsuggestive: it may be a compound of the words kátci (spread out or surface ofthe Earth) and náa (father),19 in essence an ‘overseer of the Earth’, a fatherfigure. As for the plural katsinam, it applies as much to nature spirits as itdoes to physical intermediaries who possess a working knowledge of the laws ofnature and how to bend them — Lookers such as Massau’u and members of hisentourage, who similarly assisted another tribe, the Hisat-Sinom, better knownas Anasazi.The katsinam are commemorated in art and ritual wearing unusual andtechnical-looking headgear, sometimes with what appear to be antennae, certainlynot the type of practical garb one wears in the extreme heat of desert plateaus.Hopi elder Don Talayesva offers an eye-opening portrayal of the relationshipbetween the katsinam and the original people of this land: “My fathers anduncles showed me their ancestral masks and explained that long ago the realKatsinam had come regularly to Oraibi [Third Mesa] and had danced in the plaza.They explained that since the people had become so wicked — since there were nowso many Two-Hearts in the world — the Katsinam stopped coming in person and senttheir spirits to enter the masks on dance days.”20Cultural traditions agree that katsinam appeared at the crossing point betweenthe destruction and creation of world ages, that they inhabited two worlds, andtraveled here from very far away. They are regarded as ancestors but notprogenitors of the people during the migrations after the great flood.21 Theunique nature of the katsina dances suggests an immortalization of physicalpeople whose ideas, dress and appearance became ritualized and rememberedbecause these benevolent outsiders were instrumental in the cultural, civic andarchitectural development of the Hopi and Anasazi during their time oforigination. Even more surprising is how so many petroglyphs in northern Arizonadepict the katsinam in a rectangular format with arms upraised, like a kind ofhallmark bearing a passing resemblance to the Orion constellation.Zuni tradition brings a layer of understanding to the relationship betweenkatsinam and the \"flying shields.\" The Zuni claim the katsina ceremonycommemorates pilots communicating with each other, each katsina representingreal people who once were referred to as gods.22 As for the flying shieldsthemselves, Hopi legends refer to them as paatuwvota — literally 'magic flyingshield used as a vehicle’ — whose derivative, paatsöviw, an insect that skateson the surface of water. That paints quite a picture of vessels hovering overthe sea.23 These aerial craft have a curious parallel in the Indian sacred textVisuddhi-Magga, where an \"air-katsina\" is described in the context of atrance-inducing tool, one of ten items inherited from the time of gods.24One of my favorite stories featuring the flying shields is that of a young Hopibride accompanying her katsina husband back to her village: “This time on theirway home, the two were going to travel by flying shield. Together they climbedonto the shield and the girl firmly shut her eyes. As the shield lifted off, thekatsinam all gave out a boisterous yell. The spectacle was incredible; everysort of katsina conceivable was present. All of a sudden as the couple flewalong, flashes of lightning were visible in the air and the rumble of thundercould be heard. When the shield rose higher, drizzle began to fall. The katsinamwere now accompanying them. They actually followed the pair in the form ofclouds... Customarily, a bride is returned to her residence in the morning.Therefore the parents had headed to the edge of the mesa at this time to lookout. Looking down from the rim of the mesa, they saw an incredible number ofpeople coming across the plain. To their amazement all were katsinam, singingand crying out their calls.”25THE WATCHERS OF WALPIThe Hopi believe themselves to be one of the first inhabitants of the Americancontinent, and certainly their village of Oraibi is the oldest continuouslyoccupied settlement in the United States.26 Two other centers of habitationcling to vertiginous, six hundred-foot high mesas whose alignment bears apassing resemblance to the belt of Orion, and together with other main cultcenters, form a close resemblance to the entire constellation across theAmerican southwest.27It is the village of Walpi that is of greatest interest to our quest. Located onFirst Mesa, the name literally means Place of the Watchers.28 Referred to asTuuwalaqa (Protectors), one of their central figures is an individual calledSótuknang (Heart of the Sky God), a messenger of the creator god Taiowa, whosemission was to travel to Earth and create a landscape fit for habitation afterthe flood.29 Obviously this now establishes a direct link between the Hopi, theWatchers and the Anunaki, and opens up all kinds of possibilities. For one, ifthe Watchers and the katcinam are one and the same people, were they literallycapable of inhabiting two worlds, as the Hopi and Zuni suggest? Is thecollective term coined by the Hopi and Zuni for these individuals — Star People— merely a metaphor, or is it an accurate description of their astronomicalknowledge as well as ability to travel among the stars? And if so, are theseStar People the same as Starwalkers — the Urukehu of New Zealand, Easter Islandand Tiwanaku?It seems as though Hopi and Zuni traditions are finally intertwining a number ofloose threads, so let’s see where the association with the stars takes us.The peaceful Hopi people believed their ancestors came from outside the Earth,specifically the Pleiades, and it is said the general demeanour of Pleiadians isreflected in Hopi lifestyle. Dakota legends give similar weight to this starcluster – Tiyami they call it, their ancestral homeland. The Cree peoplebelieved that in a time before history, their ancestors arrived from the starsin spirit form, only to become humans on Earth. The Lakota speak of mysteriouscelestial beings that manifest as spheres of light and often choose particularchildren to follow them on a journey through space and time. No wonder NativeAmericans perceive the issue of alien visitation in a spiritual manner, asPlains Cree author Stephane Wuttunee explains: “[My people] give far greaterattention to the seeking of the spiritual understanding of things rather thangoing after “the truth” as people from dominant cultures do. This is part of thereason why we tend to stand back and view or listen at first rather than bare inwith questions or take the hard, direct approach.”30[images/00157.jpg]Lookers with distinctive antennae. Sego Canyon, Utah.Growing up in a tight-knit community, Stephane listened attentively to thestories passed down by the elders of his tribe. He says they spoke of “distantrelations and Star People living amongst the stars many times, mainly aroundcampfires and during traditional ceremonies. Far from being anything to befeared, Star People was just another term I grew up around. I remember listeningin awe and fascination at the thought of us having relations that lived off andoutside our world, and sometimes spoke to them in my silent moments at night. Iwanted to know who they were and what they looked like, if they had familieslike us, etc... It wasn’t until my later teens that I discovered that peoplefrom the dominant cultures were talking about the same “people” as my eldersdid, though each side’s sense of perception of these people seemed radicallydifferent from one another.”31One common characteristic among all the gods of the flood we’ve encountered sofar is their advanced knowledge of astronomy, and the sentiment is shared bymany indigenous people of North America: “My people tell of Star People who cameto us many generations ago,” recalls Richard Wagamese of the Wabaseemoong FirstPeople. “The Star people brought spiritual teachings and stories and maps of thecosmos and they offered these freely. They were kind, loving and set a greatexample. When they left us, my people say there was loneliness like no other. IfStar People did come to the Ojibway, where did they go? Where did they comefrom? Who brought teachings to them? What scientific magic did they own thatallowed them to make such an incredible journey – and is it possible for us?”32[images/00158.jpg]Flying shields depicted on a petroglyph panel. Three Mesas, Arizona.This puts a better perspective on the aforementioned flying shields. NativeAmericans openly talked about them long before the recent ancient alien craze.The late Oglala Sioux holy man Black Elk describes one of his personalexperiences: “So when I went to vision quest, that disk came from above. Thescientists call that a… Unidentified Flying Object, but that’s a joke, see?Because they are not trained, they lost contact with the wisdom, power and gift.So that disk landed on top of me. It was concave, and there was another one ontop of that. It was silent, but it lit and luminesced like neon lights. Even thesacred robes there were luminesced, and those tobacco ties lying there lit uplike little light bulbs. Then these little people came, but each little groupspoke a different language. They could read minds, and I could read their minds.I could read them. So there was silent communication. You could read it, likewhen you read silent symbols in a book. So we were able to communicate… They arehuman, so I welcomed them. I said, “Welcome, Welcome…”33All this brings a little twist to our adventure. We have been looking all alongfor terrestrial homelands for these ancient architects, but it appears we needto expand our gaze. Whoever these individuals were or where they came from, theycertainly possessed an understanding, a technology even, that was far and abovethat of the average ancient human. But why should a group of Watchers have feltcompelled to stay after the flood and assist in rebuilding Earth's decimatedpopulation, then disappearing, leaving future communication to be made throughmore subtle means such as telepathy and shamanic journeying?I was sharing my thoughts with Clifford Mahooty, who has himself experiencedclose encounters with these beings on many occasions and feels they are nothingless than benevolent people. Then, in the middle of a conversation about thegreat kiva at Chaco Canyon, which I’ve always felt to be oversized for itsintended purpose, Clifford remarked, \"That's because it was never a kiva. That'swhat archeologists think. If they'd asked us we would have told them the realpurpose. It was never used for ceremony, it was used as a space port.\"34104 DEGREES IN THE CANYONBy the time I reached the Ghost Panel, Horseshoe Canyon was becoming toasty.Beneath a vertical limestone canopy, seven hooded figures in red ochre standalongside a distinctive eighth. They are tall, elegant. Amid the stillness ofthe canyon floor, the silence is deafening. Yes, I had encountered them threetimes on my travels, and yes, the Hopi and Zuni are right, they communicate in avery unusual way. One experience was during an unplanned visit to Kephren’spyramid, when the same hooded, cloaked people emerged from the walls of theKings Chamber and, as three of my colleagues will testify, we saw them as clearas daylight amid absolute darkness. The full account is given in my book TheDivine Blueprint. The experience has stayed with me to this day, partly becauseI wasn't expecting it, partly because it proves the indigenous traditions arecorrect, but mostly because it is as humbling as it is overwhelming.A few years later I would take a private group to the Kings Chamber during oneof my tours to sacred places. As I began a meditation I had the unexpectedpleasure of watching the same figures reappear and position themselves behindeach of the sixteen participants. Later at dinner, I asked for theirimpressions. Without prompting, a quarter of them felt a tall person standbehind, arms outstretched, and the feeling of being protected if they were tofall backward, like a sign of trust.It’s exactly how I'd seen it.Clifford was right, I did know the people pictured on the Horseshoe Canyonpanel, they refer to themselves as Watchers.Lookers, indeed![images/00159.jpg]Seven plus one Lookers. Horseshoe Canyon, Utah.KNOWLEDGE OF THE FEWMy mentor, the late historian and antiquarian John Michell once argued thatprehistoric monuments all over the world \"were all designed in accordance withone scheme of proportion in units of measurement which are everywhere thesame... relics of a former elemental science, founded on principles of which weare now ignorant... At some period, thousands of years ago, almost every cornerof the world was visited by people with a particular task to accomplish. Withthe help of some remarkable power, by means of which they could cut and raiseenormous blocks of stone, these [people] created vast astronomical instruments,circles of erect pillars, pyramids, underground tunnels, cyclopean stoneplatforms, all linked together by a network of tracks and alignments, whosecourse from horizon to horizon was marked by stones, mounds and earthworks.\"35This “former elemental science” is precisely what people like the Hopi and theTamil describe as having been part of a development of innovation during theYounger Dryas, in complete contradiction to the backward-cave-dweller-humanmodel expounded by historians. Echoes of this knowledge are all around if onecares to look, and it begins to explain the spontaneous flowering of humancivilization around 8000 BC. Humans suddenly discovered civilization because ithad already been established before the flood.To illustrate the point, during the reign of pharaoh Geb — one of the originalNeterw — it is said he came into possession of a golden box long protectedinside a fortress somewhere along Egypt’s eastern frontier. This talismancontained effects belonging to his grandfather Ra. The story goes that, once heascended the throne, Geb ordered said box to be brought to him to be unsealed.In hindsight it proved to be a careless move because the moment the box wasopened, “the breath of the divine serpent” sent out a bolt of fire of such forceit struck dead all Geb’s attendants and gave the pharaoh what appears to bethird-degree burns.36 The tale is remarkably similar to the later Hebrew storyof the Ark of the Covenant, so much so that it makes one wonder whether this wasthe same device — Palestine and the Levant having once been part of the kingdomof Egypt — or whether there were many golden boxes of a scientific nature passedon from an earlier and technologically advanced culture. In both the Egyptianand Hebrew narratives each box contained a rod (Ra and Aaron’s respectively) andboth killed or maimed anyone who failed to handle its contents withoutunderstanding the instruction manual, as the Philistine guards found out whenthey contracted hemorrhoids.The priests of Sais once confided in Solon, \"in our temples we have preservedfrom the earliest times a written record of any great or splendid achievement ornotable event which has come to our ears.\"37 Fifteen hundred years later theEgyptian historian Ibn Abd El Hakim was still remarking on how so many of thetemples were designed to protect the ancient knowledge and technology of theantediluvian gods. With regard to what was placed inside the pyramids, hedescribes, “arms that did not rust, and glass which might be bent but notbroken... an idol of black granite... when anyone looked upon him, he heard onone side of him a voice which took away his sense, so that he fell prostate uponhis face and did not cease until he died.” He further describes anotherprotective device, a statue to which one was magically drawn “until he stuck toit, and could not be separated from it until such time as he died.”38When caliph Al-Ma’mum and his men attempted to enter the Great Pyramid in thesame era, they did so by blasting their way in because, by then, no one knewwhere the entrance was located. Only by blind luck and dynamite did theydislodge a limestone plug securing the ascending passage leading to the interiorof the building, only to face a further succession of massive granite plugs. Thebuilding was still sealed. Ma’mum hadn't been driven by the promise of monetarytreasure, but the certainty it contained objects from a high civilization, suchas exotic metals, spells that held power over nature and, as we saw earlier, \"asecret chamber containing maps and tables of the celestial and terrestrialspheres. Although they were said to have been made in antediluvian times, theywere supposed to be of great accuracy.\"39 Like the pharaoh Khufu three thousandyears before him, Ma’mum had sought out another temple somewhere on the Gizaplateau said to contain a room called Inventory, where the books and objectsonce owned by Twt were stored. Like Khufu, he was to be thwarted.Many pyramids in Egypt are problematic for the pyramids-are-burial-chamberscartel. The Pyramid of Sekhemkhet at Saqqara was found completely sealed alongwith its ‘sarcophagus’ which, when opened, was found to be empty. The Pyramid ofMeidum was likewise sealed and contained nothing inside, not even a box. Perhapsthe treasures that glory hounds such as Ma’mum sought were the buildingsthemselves, because anyone interested in numbers or astronomy is able to extractall manner of useful information. Take the Great Pyramid, for example, itencodes the precise value of the Earth’s polar radius. It is a scale model ofthe northern hemisphere on a scale of 1:43,200, a number deliberately chosen toreflect the seconds in a 12-hour day, making the building time-commensurate aswell. The number is not an accident, it reflects the Earth's full axial tilt(21,600 years x2), a recurring number expressed in myths as 432, 4320, 432,000and so on. From its base divisor of 72 we can derive the age of each house ofthe zodiac, 2160 years. Twelve houses in the zodiac equals 25,920 years,otherwise known as the Great Year or the Precession of the Equinoxes.40 And thisis just a quick synopsis of one antediluvian building.The smaller pyramid, the one attributed to Menkaure, is especially puzzling. Thelower sixteen courses are faced with megalithic blocks of red granite,interlocked in a jigsaw pattern much like those at Saqsayhuaman and features thesame protruding knobs. Its descending passage and innermost chamber, which arefitted inside solid bedrock, are made from chocolate granite composed offeldspar, mica and quartz, an extremely hard material to work with under anycircumstances. Mica was the material of choice in Central American temples. An extensivelayer of sheet mica was found sandwiched between two upper levels of the Pyramidof the Sun at Teotihuacan; more sheets were discovered nearby in the aptly namedMica Temple. Two additional 90 square feet pieces were discovered under a thickslab floor, and of a specific elemental variety found four thousand miles awayin Brazil.41[images/00160.jpg][images/00161.jpg]Part of the lower course of red granite is still attached to the pyramidattributed to Menkaure. is hardest of rocks is eroded by water, in a regionthat hasn’t seen signi cant rainfall in over 6000 years. Note the sameprotruding knobs common to Andean temples. Giza.Mica is generally used as an electrical insulator and capacitor, a clue to theultimate purpose of the buildings.Inside Menkaure’s pyramid, ancient architects made it even harder for themselvesby allowing little room in which to maneuver the huge blocks of stone — from aslittle as two feet down to a few inches. There is no headroom in which to placelifting equipment, nor is the inner chamber large enough for more than a handfulof people, who would be physically incapable of lifting the stones anyway. Theonly possible explanation is that the granite blocks were hydraulically raisedinto place. Which begs a further question: why line the interior of thesepassages and chambers which are carved out of solid bedrock, the ceiling is notlikely to collapse?Rumours of technology from a bygone era and protected from damage by the greatflood are rife throughout Egypt. When Setnau, one of the sons of Ramses II, cameacross the story that Twt had hidden one of his books in a repository somewherenear the Giza Plateau, he set out with his brother to find it: “On the third daythey found it... went down into the place where the tomb was. When the twobrothers came into the tomb they found it to be brilliantly lit by light whichcame forth from the book.”42 It can be argued that the story is metaphorical,the Mysteries of the ancients were always veiled in this manner, and since weare talking about a book of wisdom it is not inconceivable that what shone fromthe book was something akin to light — enlightenment. Conversely, it is worthremembering the earlier story of the antediluvian Yim who was provided insidehis ark with a 'window, self-shining from within'.43 \"There are uncreated lightsand created lights,\"44 explains the god Ahura Mazda, who gave Yim other goodiessuch as a jeweled glass throne or chariot capable of flight, and a miraculouscup in which one could see everything that was happening anywhere in theworld.45 Over in Central America, Quetzalcoatl’s nemesis, the Tula leaderTezcatilpoca, is said to have had at his disposal a kind of smoking mirror whichenabled him to see the activities of men and gods from afar, much like a crossbetween close-circuit television and radar. It was made from a stone calledTezcat, and from it, other mirrors were manufactured to be used by magicianstrained in the art of divination.46Statues of Viracocha depict him holding two unusual objects, although they areso worn they cannot be properly identified. In central Mexico, abetter-preserved group of nine-foot tall statues of Tula warriors are depictedin the same upright pose. Legends state how these gods — referred to as Atlantes— armed themselves with xiuhcoatl (fire serpents) which emitted burning rayscapable of piercing and dismembering a human body. I wonder whether this mayhave been the device with which many of those megaliths were cut and carved likebutter, after all, in Cuzco and Saqsayhuaman the stones show clear signs ofhaving been subjected to intense heat.[images/00162.jpg]Atlantes with their fire serpents. Tula, Mexico.The central argument in many texts and myths maintains that the events whichshook the Earth 11,000 years ago resulted from the abuse of power and thecareless sharing of inappropriate technology with comparatively immature humans.The culprits are said to have been a group of renegade Watchers. Before thisabuse took place we are informed that the knowledge was willingly passed alongto responsible individuals who would preserve it and share with survivors afterthe Earth was wiped clean. On this matter, the Estonian scholar Amar Annuselegantly points out, \"One way to preserve the knowledge was to inscribepre-flood wisdom in its entirety on different tablets or stones and either burythem or to install the knowledge carriers on high places to escape theperdition.\"47In Mesopotamian tradition, such a divine source of restricted information wasthe Tablet of Destinies, originally in the possession of seven Apkallu,48 whichcorresponds to the divine secrets in the Pargod in 3 Enoch. Enoch was probablydescribing this momentous occasion when he wrote in his own words: \"Then theLord [Anu] called one of his Archangels named Uriel, who was the most learned ofthem all, and said: 'Bring out the books from my library and give Enoch a penfor speedy writing, and tell him what the books are about'. And Uriel hurriedand brought me the books, smelling of myrrh, and handed me a pen.\"49[images/00163.jpg]Another panel of Lookers/Watchers with the snaking emblem, identifying them asPeople of the Serpent. Horseshoe Canyon, Arizona."},{"pageContent":"> 17. THE TERRIBLE TAURIDSPeruvians need little excuse to take to the streets to celebrate, be it afestival, a notable figure or religious occasion, in fact, one would be forgivenfor believing an underground movement exists solely for the invention of obscuresaints. One day I was walking through old Cuzco looking for misplaced megalithsamong its residential buildings — I found an entire wall inside a gift shop —when it became progressively more difficult to get from one side of the streetto the other. The population had tripled, a sea of people flowed towards thecentral plaza. Of course! The beginning of November, everyone must be outcelebrating the fertility festival popularly known as May Day. Peru lies in thesouthern hemisphere, so the calendars are reversed.In Europe, May Day is a Christian feast day, cunningly usurped from the Celtswho’d been practicing it thousands of years earlier as Beltane. Its mirroredopposite is Samhain, the cross-quarter in the solar calendar marking the fallowdays when nature has yielded its bounty and retreats into a period of gestationfrom which life is born anew on the winter solstice. This too was usurped andrenamed All Souls Day, that annoying November ritual when peer pressure forcesintelligent people on the evening prior to participate in a gruesome desecrationof children’s otherwise healthy teeth.But this was not the case in Peru. Everyone was out commemorating Aya MarcayKilla, literally ‘the month of carrying corpses’. They were honoring the dead.To make it more confusing, it’s been traditionally regarded as a water or rainceremony, yet November is already the wet season in the Andes, so why the needfor a rain festival when it is already pouring? Besides, right up to the time ofthe Inka, a second festival took place in May to honor the spirit world, exactlyas it is done in the northern hemisphere every November.Two feasts commemorating the dead? What is going on here?DAYS OF THE DEADThis calendrical mix-up is not an anomaly restricted to the Andes. Beforecolonization by Catholics, the people of Tonga and other Pacific Islands southof the equator also held a remembrance for deceased ancestors early in November,as did Australian aborigines, in ceremonies culminating around the seventeenthof the month; Hindu, Persians and Japanese did likewise in the northernhemisphere. In Yucatan and Guatemala, and specifically the Lake Petén regionassociated with the Itzà, it is tradition to bake cakes from the very best cornand hang them from branches of sacred trees or at crossroads and isolated nooks,typically around the 17th of November.All this is most odd because places in opposite hemispheres shouldn’t be holdingcommon observances in the same month. And it gets stranger. The ancientremembrance of the dead doesn’t just occur in every corner of the world, it doesso when the Pleiades occupy a conspicuous position in the sky that has nothingto do with their folkloric role as heralds of spring and the planting season.1At one time in India — north of the equator — November was regarded as the Monthof the Pleiades, despite the Pleiades not being prominent in the sky untilApril. This makes even less sense when one considers that every two thousandyears this seven-star cluster rises in a different month,2 and yet the Novemberfestival remains constant. Since the timing is of no practical use to peoplesuch as farmers, who rely on the exalted position of the stars to mark thereturn of Spring, is it possible the Indians might have been commemorating anevent in which the Pleiades played an important role?In Arizona on the first day of the New Moon in November — also called theInitiates or Hawk Moon — members of the Hopi kiva prepare, fast and cleansebefore undertaking a private ceremony called Wúwutcim. On a symbolic level itmarks the time when the Earth lies cold and barren, and by extension theindividual. But there’s more to it. Wúwutcim marks the beginning of the newceremonial year and recalls the first phase of Creation — rituals typicallyreserved for the winter solstice. During the restricted ceremony, an elderrepresenting Masau’u shares with young initiates the teachings of thisantediluvian Watcher, while the kachinam appear for a brief time on Earth. Inmany ways it is similar to the feast of Samhain, when the barrier between worldsis thinner and honor is given to ancestors and protective spirits. The Hopiceremony begins with a New Fire ritual the moment the belt of Orion appearsabove the kiva,3 and closes sixteen days later with the Pleiades appearing inthe same position at midnight. On the seventeenth day, the entire villagecelebrates.The Pleiades are generally regarded by ancient cultures as a group of heavenlyluminaries dispensing knowledge and wisdom. Temples were raised throughout theworld in honor of this cluster of faint stars and their positive influence uponhuman affairs, so it is both odd and contradictory to find the Pleiades alsolooked upon as the seven Stars of Death — as they were throughout Persia andMesopotamia where November was called Mordad (Angel of Death), the month whenthe festival of the dead culminated with the ascendency of the Pleiades atmidnight on the seventeenth of the month. In Egypt it was performed as athree-day festival dedicated to At-Hyr (Hathor) in commemoration of aworld-destroying deluge and the souls who perished in it,4 a stance also adoptedin the Hebrew account of the flood: “Now the deluge was caused by the malewaters from the sky meeting the female waters which issued forth from theground. The holes in the sky by which the upper waters escaped were made by Godwhen he removed stars out of the constellation of the Pleiades; and in order tostop this torrent of rain, God had afterwards to bung up the two holes with acouple of stars borrowed from the constellation of the Bear. That is why theBear runs after the Pleiades to this day; she wants her children back, but shewill never get them till after the Last Day.”5 Strange how the same storyappears in the Aboriginal tribal lore Water Girls of the Pleiades, who emergefrom a hole in the sky in Orion prior to a major catastrophe.6 The Talmud alsocontains a legend associating the Pleiades with the world flood: “When the HolyOne wished to bring the deluge upon the world, he took two stars out of thePleiades and thus let the deluge loose”7 a passage eerily reminiscent of theAndean flood account of the farmer looking up at the sky and watching “angrystars gathering close to the Sun.”Later, misinformed Aztecs took the association to its extreme. They regarded therising of the Pleiades at midnight every fifty-two years as a cosmic sign thatthe sky was falling and the world was about to end, and sacrificed up to 50,000people a day to forestall the event.In the south Pacific the cluster is at its most prominent towards April and May,and yet in the Society Islands and other cultures, where the Pleiades were knownas Matari’I, the Festival of the Dead began at the end of October to welcome thegod of paradise in commemorating those who had departed and to share in the joyof the living. At the end of the occasion, the Breath of God was instilled oncemore across the Earth.8 That was prior to Christian missionaries arriving onTahiti to change the calendar and put an end to all the fun.9The question now is, what took place so long ago in the region of the Pleiadesduring November that made this star cluster synonymous with death in so manyparts of the planet?UNWANTED VISITORS FROM SPACEThe forty-two books written by the antediluvian god Twt were said to cover everyfacet of knowledge.10 Naturally the tomes were zealously guarded and handed downfrom one remote generation to another, from the Followers of Horus to thepharaohs, and maintained by the priesthood at Iwnw. Twt’s particular focusappears to have been astronomy and geography, in essence corroborating Plato’sremark about the Egyptians having carefully observed stars for ten thousandyears. Why would anyone be so obsessed with marking the motions of the heavensto a level far in excess of what is required for agriculture or navigation?Likewise the Itzà, the Olmec and the Maya assiduously marked time spans coveringover 140,000 years, too long to be of practical use for a species with anaverage life span of seventy years. This fixation is a common trait of all thegods we’ve encountered so far.The following statistic might clarify things. It is estimated that an average of200,000 tons of debris falls onto the Earth from interplanetary space everyyear.11 Hardly surprising, then, that even as late as the 7th century theChinese astronomer Li Ch’un Feng was compelled to describe comets as “vilestars. Every time they appear… something happens to wipe out the old andestablish the new.” Maori peoples didn’t care much for such space junk either,they looked upon a Tunui-a-te-ika (comet) as a tormenting demon whose appearancewas a precursor to certain death,12 while the Sumerians put such incomingprojectiles into perspective with the word agh-hu-bua — great celestialinundation.The Native American Ojibwa, like the aboriginal cultures of Australia, have along memory of events that took place deep in prehistory, such as the recurringorbit of a large comet whose tail sows unimaginable destruction across theEarth: “The star with the long, wide tail is going to destroy the world some daywhen it comes low again. That’s the comet called Long-Tailed Heavenly ClimbingStar. It came down here once, thousands of years ago. Just like the Sun, it hadradiation and burning heat in its tail. The comet burned everything to theground. There wasn’t a thing left. Indian people were here before that happened,living on the earth. But things were wrong; a lot of people had abandoned thespiritual path. The holy spirit warned them a long time before the comet came.Medicine men told everyone to prepare. Things were wrong with nature on earth...Then that comet went through here... It flew so low the tail scorched theearth... The comet made a different world. After, the survival was hard work.The weather was colder than before.”13[images/00164.jpg]Comet over Mount Taranaki, New Zealand. Indigenous people the world over arewary of passing space rocks.The Navajo have an even older recollection. One of their sky gods streaked downfrom heaven as a flaming serpent and left a calling card in the shape of MeteorCrater in Arizona. The impact is estimated to be 50,000 years old.The word comet is used as a general term, but it is useful to distinguishbetween the types of rocks flying around in space. The general agreement amongastronomers is that a comet consists of a nucleus of ice and dust, and developsa tail of gas and dust when approaching the Sun. By comparison, an asteroid is asmall rocky body orbiting the Sun, although ‘small’ is a relative term, someasteroids are 600 miles in diameter. A meteor, on the other hand, is a body ofmatter that enters the Earth’s atmosphere and disintegrates, while a meteoriteis the type that makes full body contact.The latter is the type that concerns us.Mounting evidence suggests the Earth crossed a stream of cosmic debris around10,800 BC containing fragments of a once massive planetary object, nowdisintegrated, portions of which crashed to the ground and triggered the YoungerDryas,14 the irony being that Earth crossed the same path 1100 years later andclosed said glacial period,15 when “seven burning mountains hurtled towards theEarth,” to put it in the words of Enoch the scribe.16A scientific paper from the University of California provides a visual dimensionto events leading up to the Younger Dryas. The scientists involved wereexamining the sudden mass extinction of camels, mastodons, horses andsabre-toothed cats in North America, along with a major decimation of humanpopulation around 11,000 BC. The paper posits that meteorite impacts in thenorthern hemisphere, many smashing directly into the great ice sheets, wereresponsible for the abundance of nanodiamonds distributed over 20 million squaremiles across the face of the Earth. This material is produced by the kind oftemperature variations, pressure and oxygen levels associated with anextraterrestrial collision which leaves a thin, black, carbon-rich layer insubsurface soil. Additional glassy materials such as cosmic impact spherules,high-temperature melt-glass, grapelike soot clusters, carbon spherules andplatinum were also formed at temperatures in excess of 2200 degrees Celsius, allconsistent with a meteorite impact. Altogether the field of debris covers 10% ofthe planet.17 Thirty-two sites on three continents were analysed, revealing alarge concentration in North America and Western Europe. As one of thescientists summed up, “Our hypothesis challenges some existing paradigms withinseveral disciplines, including impact dynamics, archaeology, palaeontology andpalaeoceanography/palaeoclimatology, all affected by this relatively recentcosmic impact.”18 To give a sense of perspective, one impact crater discoveredbeneath the Hiawatha Glacier in Greenland measures nineteen miles in diameterand was produced by a mile-wide object.19This is what triggered the Younger Dryas. For evidence of the closing event onecan look to the large meteorite craters dating from 10,000 - 8,000 BC foundalong the eastern and south-eastern seaboard of North America. They are hard tomiss, there are over one hundred thousand of them, concentrated along thecoastline between Florida and Virginia. The field of impact is called theCarolina Bays and its discovery dates back to 1931 when a new survey of theeastern seaboard called for a photogrammetric experiment, for which a companyspecializing in aerial photography was commissioned. When the films wereenlarged and examined in stereo they revealed vivid images of an impact sitecomposed of gigantic mud-filled craters, so much so that pilots looking at themdrew comparisons to the bomb craters of battlefields from the First World War.The area is scarred with three thousand troughs, half of them longer than 1300feet, one hundred longer than 5250 feet. In total they cover an elongatedelliptical area of 63,500 square miles. The longitudinal axes of the craters runparallel, indicating the descending meteorites must have been traveling in thesame direction and, given the shape of the craters’ thrust walls along thesoutheast, suggests the space rocks arrived from the northwest. Since thecraters are both elliptical and circular, the indication is of a descending bodythat disintegrated and exploded, leaving two different sets of impressions alongwith a mess of overlapping craters.20 The sand around the crater rims alsodisplays evidence of excessive heat caused by the impacts.[images/00165.jpg]LIDAR image of oval impact craters called the Carolina Bays. North CarolinaNaturally the consequences were immediate, even on the opposite coast of NorthAmerica where more than one billion fish were found petrified on the formerseabed off the coast of California around the period of impact.It seems Enoch’s description of “seven burning mountains” was a tad understated,it was nothing short of a swarm.EARTH’S DANCE WITH DEATHThe Mahabharata paints the offending meteorite that generated the global floodin graphic terms as a horrific one-eyed bird with one wing in the night sky,screaming and vomiting blood. According to various world accounts the Earth wassubsequently covered in a thick, chocking dust, accompanied by rough winds, andfireballs that crashed with hissing sounds. Darkness covered the land. Survivorsused torches to light their way at midday. Mountains collapsed onto the plains.It was said to have appeared during the Indian month of Kartitika, the middle ofOctober to early November, and obscured the normal view of the Pleiades. Thereis only one known culprit who arrives like clockwork from this sector of the skyat the same time each year: the Taurid meteor shower.The Taurids are named after their radiant point in Taurus, the constellationstanding between the Pleiades and Orion, from where they are seen to emerge inthe sky. Due to the gravitational perturbations of planets, Jupiter inparticular, the Taurids have spread out over time to become two separateshowers: the Southern Taurids, active from approximately September 10 toNovember 20, are the remains of Comet Encke, while the Northern Taurids, activefrom approximately October 20 to December 10, originate from an asteroid. Still,the Taurids are believed to be remnants of an even larger body thatdisintegrated within the last twenty or thirty thousand years, otherwise theasteroids would have spread around the inner planetary system and no longer berecognizable as a stream.21 Even so it is still the largest stream in the innersolar system. It takes two weeks for the Earth to pass through it — a timeframethat coincides with the period allocated to ceremonies performed by people suchas the Hopi. Every late October to mid-November the Earth plays a dangerous gameof dodgems while we stare up at the night sky, marvelling at a spectacle webelieve to be benign but in reality comes with a history of devastation thatwould make a Hollywood special effects team blush.And now for the second instalment of this uplifting story. Because the Taurids’twenty-million mile wide trail of debris follows an orbital path, the Earthreplays this game once more every June, except this time the stakes are ahigher, because cross sections of the stream approach from the Earth's daytimeside and cannot be visually observed.The Taurid stream has a cycle of activity that peaks roughly every 2,500 to3,000 years, when its core passes nearer to Earth and produces either moreintense showers or total annihilation. It’s pure luck. Sometimes Earth wins,but, on occasion, it loses. On June 25, 1178, a monk at Canterbury Cathedralwitnessed a fragment of the Taurids colliding with the Moon, creating what wouldbecome known as the Girodano Bruno crater. The impact sent out a tail of debristall enough to be seen for several nights. The date coincides with a series ofnotable meteorite impacts on Earth catalogued by Chinese astronomers of theperiod, some impacting New Zealand to form the Tapaniu craters on the SouthIsland. The event was recorded by the Waitaha, who describe the catastrophicforest fires that led to a mass extinction of bird species.The most recent Taurid event took place in June 30, 1908, when a fireballstreaked across the northern hemisphere and exploded over Tungusta, Siberia. ARussian scientific paper published an analysis of results of micro-samplesrecovered from the peat bog near the epicenter and revealed the origin to bemeteoric.22Since the end of the Younger Dryas, the Earth has been on the receiving end ofdozens of such minor hits, reminders of the importance of monitoring the skyand, if necessary, developing inconveniently long calendars and hard-wiring thewarning into standing megaliths or the walls of massive temples.Why were the ancients afraid of comets? Because they had reason to be.[images/00166.jpg]Hopi Snake Clan member enters kiva. Arizona."},{"pageContent":"> 18. ORION THE UBIQUITOUS\"The Watchers could take on human form when they wanted to.” — Book of EnochYucatan. January.Uxmal is another of my ‘second homes’. The centrepiece of this temple city isits distinctive curved Pyramid of the Magician, erected in a single night, sothe legend goes. Like other organic temples it grew over time, adapting to thechanging skies, becoming five pyramids in one. Its grandiose staircase is linedwith the inescapable effigies of Cha’ac, God of Rain. An enclosure skirts thebase, built in a style more common to Saqqara or Angkor than Yucatan. Out of theblue, my good colleague Miguel Angel Vergara tells me, “There’s a phraseassociated with this temple, a mantra used to connect with and open the recordsembedded inside: Nak-He-Nah-Tun, it means Pyramid of Precious Stone of theChildren of the Turtle. The Children of the Turtle is humans.”“The phrase sounds remarkably like Akh-en-Aten,” I remarked.Now, what would the name of an Egyptian pharaoh be doing in Yucatan describingthe function of a pyramid, I wonder? Miguel looked surprised too, he’d nevereven heard of Akhenaten. And there’s a lot of Egypt in the Yucatan, for example,the Maya supreme god Ahau is the nickname given to the Shining Ones, Followersof Horus; like Osiris, both K’uKuulKaan and Quetzalcoatl are depicted inblue-green (as is Siva, for that matter), while both Egyptian and Maya dynastiestrace their lineage beyond the Oldest Dryas. The Maya words hom (ball court),and ik (air) are Egyptian — hem (little ball), ikh (suspend in air) — as are thewords for canoe, reed, well, house and snake.Watching the low-angle light from the setting Sun pick out the detail of thePyramid of the Magician is one of life’s great pleasures. The other is watchingthe shape of Orion dominate the sky above it at night, as though the two weremade for each other; at this latitude its belt stars rise above it like aflagpole. The Maya look upon Orion as the First Father Hunhunahpo, a grain godwho figuratively dies and resurrects — like Osiris — and they placed greatimportance on three specific stars in this constellation: Saiph, Alnitak, andthe great blue giant Rigel. Together they represent the Three Stones of theHearth, the very foundation of Maya cosmology and its associated temple culture.Directly in the center of this equilateral triangle lies Nebula M42. The Mayacall it K’ak, the very flame of creation.This hearth is physically represented by three standing stones in the center ofan altar in Uxmal’s quadrangle, the enclosure of the wisdom keepers — or atleast they did until the Spanish removed them during their purge of un-Christianidolatry. Yet the relationship was so integral to Maya belief that thetriangular three-stone hearth remained a feature in all traditional homes. Thecenter of the Orion triangle is referred to as Heart of the Sky, the same termgiven by the Hopi to the katcina Sótuknang.If you’ve been paying careful attention throughout this adventure you will havenoticed I’ve been dropping subtle hints here and there about Orion, the mostobvious being the Giza pyramids that mirror its belt starts, with Osiris as theconstellation’s earthly representative. There are other examples: Teotihuacan’sthree main pyramids echo the belt of Orion when its main avenue, the Way of theSoul, aligned to the constellation’s apogee on the winter solstice c.10,400 BC.Teotihuacan is one of the homes of Quetzalcoatl, Osiris’ doppelganger in Mexico.The K'iche' Maya linked Orion with a certain Jun Rakán, or huracán, a strongwind that is said to have accompanied Quetzalcoatl during the deluge.1To the people of Tonga, Orion was the most important of constellations. Theycalled it Toloa, and referenced it terrestrially with the colossal megalithHa’amonga a Maui, along with a group of large mounds, now heavily eroded,although the place name still survives.2 Perhaps this is what the Olmec had inmind when they referred the homeland of the antediluvian gods as Tollan, thePlace of Reeds, the very same description offered in Egypt.While there is no doubt the gods lived on missing lands such as Atitlán, Mu’ul,Hiva Oa, Ta Neterw, Apsû, Bhogavati, iw titi and Te Pitaka, my travels andresearch have led me to entertain the idea that their point of origin, theultimate missing land, might lay elsewhere. It may not even be terrestrial atall.Let’s see where this thought takes us.THE ORION CONNECTIONThe word Orion, of course, is a recent variant on an ancient name. Its earliestlinguistic root comes from the Anunaki sage Ur-annu (a variant of U-annu), whosename translates as ‘light of heaven’ and ‘Red Man of Anu’, a probable referenceto his hair color. Babylonian star catalogues list the constellation asSipa.Zi.An.Na, another relationship to the Anunaki because it literally meansTrue Shepherd of Anu.The Greeks later transliterated Ur-annu into Oarion (boundary), suggesting theconstellation marks some unspecified periphery, a frontier into another realmperhaps. Its Arabic name Al Jabr provides a further layer of interpretation:‘giant’ and ‘broken bones’, a nod to Osiris, the hero who is figurativelydismembered during his initiation into the Otherworld.Orion takes on related symbolism and purpose across multiple cultures. In Indiahe is Praja-pati, master of created beings, which no doubt influenced the Celticview of the constellation as the source of divine kingship, while inScandinavian lore, Orion’s Belt becomes the staff of Frigge, the goddessresponsible for making the Earth fertile. Collectively, Orion appears torepresent a place of high office as well as a source of life.One of the oldest people to adopt Orion as a talisman were the Anasazi, or asthey were originally called, Hisat-Sinom, a rather revealing name because itbreaks into two parts: hisat (people of remote times) and sinom (people or man),and it suggests a link to the Watcher and Red Ant person Anu-Sinom. If so, thename is describing 'people belonging to the remote time of Anu-Sinom'. As thetribe began to disappear, their traditions were blended into the Hopi worldview,including the belief in the influence of stars on the development of humanpsyche during its carnal entrapment. Such a sky-ground correspondence was takento its pinnacle when the Hopi came to choose the locations for their terrestrialuniverse in a remote corner of Arizona desert — the First, Second and ThirdMesas. These three natural sandstone tables, rising hundreds of feet above aparched plain, once resembled islands twelve thousand years ago when northernArizona, like ancient Egypt, was blessed with abundant rainfall. The alignmentof the mesas bears an uncanny resemblance to the pattern formed by the beltstars of Orion, with additional centers such as Betatakin, Canyon de Chelly,Homol’ovi and Wupatki completing the body.3 The Lakota or Sioux claim to havecreated a similar relationship with their sacred sites in the Black Hills ofSouth Dakota.[images/00167.jpg]The Hopi village of Walpi stands on one of three mesas that appear to mirror thebelt stars of Orion. Arizona.The relationship is reproduced on a personal level. Leading up to the Hopiwinter solstice ceremony of Soyal, the elders retire to a kiva in early Novemberto observe the passing in the night sky of Hotòmqam, the brightest star on thebelt of Orion, through an opening in the roof. As we saw in the previouschapter, once all three stars are framed by the opening, with the center starabove the fireplace, the ritual of Wúwutcim commences in accordance with thepattern first laid down on Earth.4 The ritual serves a number of purposes. Onone level it marks the rite of passage of the initiate and involves a symbolicdeath and rebirth, as practiced in the Mysteries of Osiris and otherfiguratively resurrected heroes throughout the ancient world.5 On a secondarylevel it serves to convey and commit to memory the knowledge of past events, andto honor the people from whom the rituals originated. The Hopi ceremony recountsthe Emergence legend, when the creator god Taiowa encouraged his Watcheremissary Masau’u to make the long journey from the old world to establish thecurrent world with the ancestors of the Hopi-Anasazi. The important thing tobear in mind is that the story is communicated inside the kiva the moment thecentral star of Orion’s Belt passes directly over the fire pit. Like otherancient Mysteries schools teachings, the rest of the ceremony remains a closelyguarded secret: “On the fourth day of the proceedings, visitors are barred fromthe pueblo and all trails are closed. This is a night of mystery and terror.People are forced to remain indoors and forbidden even to glance outside...Concurrently, in the kivas underground, a most esoteric and awe-inspiring ritualis being performed which no white observer has ever glimpsed.”6In yet another relationship between two ancient cultures on opposite sides ofthe planet, when Osiris ascends to Sahu (Orion) he becomes an example for othersto emulate, he is now an intermediary between sky and ground. The samerelationship appears in Arizona. A Hopi katsina by the name Sohu is described asan intermediary god between Orion and Earth. He is portrayed wearing a row ofthree dots on his chest representing the belt of Orion, which in turn isreflected in the alignment of the Three Mesas. The Hopi word for mesa is tuukvi;its derivative tuukwavi means bead or necklace. In turn, the cognates of theEgyptian word sahu are sa-t (beads), and saa-t (wisdom).7By this point the word coincidence becomes redundant.TRAVEL BETWEEN TWO WORLDSThere exist a number of curious overlaps between astral and physical travel toand from Orion, to the point where the lines between the two become blurred. Oneincidence is illustrated in Egypt. A foreman working in Saqqara in the 19thcentury came face-to-face one dawn with a jackal beside the ruined pyramid ofUnas. “It was as if the animal were taunting his human observer... and invitingthe puzzled man to chase him. Slowly the jackal sauntered towards the north faceof the pyramid, stopping for a moment before disappearing into a hole. Thebemused Arab decided to follow his lead. After slipping through the narrow hole,he found himself crawling into the dark bowels of the pyramid. Soon he emergedinto a chamber and, lifting his light, saw that the walls were covered from topto bottom with hieroglyphic inscriptions. These were carved with exquisitecraftsmanship into the solid limestone and painted over with turquoise andgold.”8The inscriptions would become known as the Pyramid Texts. They describe inminute detail the path taken by the initiate, while still alive, into theOtherworld, and the return to his or her living body. Allegedly carved around2320 BC, they portray a thorough and scientific understanding of another levelof reality that would seem above and beyond the capability of people in thissupposedly unsophisticated age. The Egyptologist Raymond Faulkner succinctlydescribed their importance: “They disclose to us a vanished world of thought andspeech, the last of the unnumbered aeons through which prehistoric man haspassed, till finally he... enters this historic age.”9[images/00168.jpg]Section of the Pyramid Texts inside the pyramid of Unas. Saqqara,Egypt.How old is this vanished world? Writing in 1934 Wallis Budge, former Keeper ofEgyptian Antiquities in London, made a valid observation that the Pyramid Textsappear to have been brought back into use around the time of Unas, because thehigh number of unknown words used and the awkward sentence construction suggeststhe texts were cobbled together from older sources, so much so that theengravers etching the hieroglyphs onto the chamber walls did not fullycomprehend what the original scribes had written, as though the material hadbeen handed down from a remote age and the workers in the twenty-third centuryBC were having difficulty translating it into the language of the day.One of the many enigmas of the Pyramid Texts concerns the aspiration of thecandidate — often a pharaoh, although the practice was open to anyone of moralintegrity — to be reborn as “this Great Star, the Companion of Orion, whotraverses the sky with Orion... you ascend from the east of the sky beingrenewed in your due season, and rejuvenated in your due time.”10 They describethe means by which the gods enable the ascent of the individual into their abodeusing a special throne made from the metal bja — not a far cry from the floodhero Yim and his flight-capable jeweled glass throne, or the ‘cloud’ thatair-lifted Enoch to the domain of the Anu. Other references are made to “aladder for you to ascend to the sky,” and the Hnw-bark, a celestial canoe thatpropels the individual across the heavens.11 The texts depict the work of agraceful poet if not an erudite astro-physicist and, like Enoch, the originalwriter may have been improvising while attempting to describe something beyondhis level of comprehension, hence a symbolism and syntax that, at times, appearsobtuse to us.[images/00169.jpg]Osiris boards the solar boat as Sahu-Orion.Since the central theme of the Pyramid Texts deals with the spiritualresurrection of the individual, it may be that the ancient source of theseinstructions is none other that the transformation of Osiris, a mortal being whobecomes as a bright star, a god, and subsequently takes on the form of Sahu,whereupon the god-man is described in the manner in which Orion appears to theeye: “his leg is long and his stride extended.” Strangely enough the sameattribute is shared by the Indian antediluvian god Vishnu who, like Osiris, isalso depicted with blue-green skin.12 Perhaps there is more to this than mereallegory, because one of the Seven Sages of India, Visvamitra, is described inboth the Ramayana and the Mahabaratha to have transferred a king of ancientIndia named Trianku to the sky in bodily form “where he now shines as theconstellation Orion.”13 Aboriginal tribes in Northern Australia certainlybelieve in a material connection because they identify the Watchers asNurrumbunguttias, and claim they physically arrived on Earth from Orion.14 Theassociation stems back to the Watchers before the great flood, because the termused to describe their first offspring, nephilim, derives from nephilâ, theAramaic for Orion. Furthermore, when Shemyaza, the leader of the renegadeWatchers, was finally apprehended by the Anu lords, he was tied and bound beforebeing made to hang upside down for all eternity in Orion.[images/00170.jpg]The Net of the World, portrayed by the Followers of Horus at Edfu.As much as the idea vexes western thinkers, such examples are not just hintingat an experience far and beyond a spiritual or shamanic journey, they areindicating a physical link between the terrestrial world and Orion, with thebelt stars serving as a kind of portal into the domain of gods; and thecandidate, having gained access to their knowledge, returns with raisedintellectual capacity that places the individual on par with the godsthemselves. The association between the two is said to have fostered the adventof gods on Earth that led to the development of human culture. In the BuildingTexts it is described how, on occasion, the gods would even allow a human tovisit their remote abode, from which the lucky individual returned enlightened,with a greater understanding of the world.Are we mature enough to accept such a leap in understanding? Perhaps. RecentlyNASA announced the existence of magnetic tubes that open every eight minuteslinking the Earth to the Sun, the space agency even using the word 'portals' inthe press release. By all accounts the antediluvian gods possessed an intimateknowledge of the mechanics of nature as well a thorough understanding of thestars. Certainly they were master navigators, but what if their expertise innavigation extended beyond the ocean? It might be the realm of science fiction,and yet for all their efforts NASA has merely rediscovered what sages in theIndian subcontinent already knew about planetary and solar mechanics. As farback as 8000 BC these portals were described in the Yayurveda as “serpents whichmove along the ground and are mirrored in the sky, which are the arrows ofsorcerers.” If it took modern humans 10,000 years to discover a mechanism bywhich the Earth is tethered to the Sun, what else might still be discovered inthis decade, that these portals also connect the Earth to other stars?WAITAHA GRANDMOTHERS’ VIEWFor the final piece of evidence on this matter we turn once more to the words ofthe Waitaha, whose ancestors were the Starwalkers, long distance voyagers whosettled on Easter Island and intermarried after the flood consumed their earthlydomain. Turning to the oral traditions of the Elder Grandmothers, we gain a newperspective on the relationship between the antediluvian Urukehu, Orion, and theinhabitants of Earth. In their own words: “Kurawaka [school of the canoe] is thename given by our ancient ancestors to the great snare constellation Te Kupengao Te Au [The Net of the World, Orion]… The name is also given to our Kurawakaancestors who travelled on the great tides of the ocean… They are the tuakana[elder brother, sister] of the nation of Waitaha. Many of our whanau [families]and hapu [family groups] descend from these original elder voyaging ancestors…Rakaiwaka is the name given to the hapu and whanau named after the central starin the Belt of Orion [star Alnilam]. Utilizing these identifiers, Pakau waka isincluded as the third star.“These three founding groups are the ancient people of Waitaha. It is thesefamilies who gave the sacred social pattern to join and become as one nationthat would live happily in peace and plenty in the lands and outer islands ofWaitangi ki Raro [Easter Island].”15Notice how the grandmothers make a point of describing Easter Island not as asingle island but as it once was, a group of lands.The three Waitaha family groups each took on the name of a star in the belt ofOrion: Kurawaka (star Mintaka) was composed of elder whanau, the leaders,thinkers, planners; Rakaiwaka (star Alnilam) were investigators, researchers,contractors; Pukauwaka (star Alnitak) were the knowledge keepers and dreamers ofthe nation.16 Orion itself was referred to as The Sacred Fish Trap of OuterSpace (Punga Tapu o Te Atea) and Net of the World, a name that conjures an imagefrom the Building Texts at Edfu in which the Followers of Horus set off on araft across the ocean, using a net for a sail. And yet it was also the titlegiven to the female flood hero of the Waitaha, Hotu Matu’a, at a stroke linkingthe Urukehu with the Aku Shemsu Hor.The Waitaha grandmothers add that contact with these ancestors took the form ofregular visitations which considerably extended the knowledge base of the tribeconcerning the mechanics of nature and the universe, not to mention social andmoral codes and other valuable information for the establishment of a healthycoexistence between people and planet. These were physical interactions ratherthan shamanic communications.17That was many thousands of years ago. Something occurred whereby the Urukehustopped coming in physical form, but frustratingly there is no explanation as towhy. From this point, the elder Waitaha seers remained in contact with theUrukehu within the spirit houses of the stars of Orion’s Belt, which theyconsidered to be both doorways to the spirit world and access points to theWaitaha’s extended family. The communication continues today. Still, the ElderGrandmothers remain unequivocal about the physical contact between the Waitahaand people from Orion, as the following quote illustrates: “In all the ancientteachings, they speak of our teachers and healers as having direct communicationwith our ancient learned ancestors who came to us in our old world villages andhelped in the development of our cultural and traditional knowledge base. Weunderstand that the teachings of the very highest orders were for those trustedsouls who have the ability to overcome ego and use the knowledge for the greatergood of the people.”18I believe this clarifies the conundrum of whether the ultimate missing land ofthe antediluvian gods was figurative, symbolic or physical. It’s all of theabove. Ancient cultures had no issue with overlapping physical reality, metaphorand symbolism, their worldview was holistic, the Universe an interconnected webof energy. A temple was a mirror of the sky, a plant was a physicalization ofconsciousness, and so forth. To them, the physical is nothing more than thenon-physical reduced in frequency, much like science now understands thataccelerating audible sound frequency forty octaves above human hearing producessonoluminescence, the transmutation of sound into visible light. Conversely,looking at the head of a needle under the microscope reveals this simple solidobject to be nothing more than a geometric aggregate of atoms, electrons andmolecules vibrating at exceptional speed, yet all such phenomena only becameaccepted when the discovery of the electron microscope finally made the unseenvisible to the eye.In the same manner, ancient sources unanimously claim there once existed a timewhen two races co-existed on Earth. After the evaporation of the last world by aflood, groups of Seven Sages led by an eighth volunteered to remain behind tosow the seeds of rejuvenation before they too returned to their boats and flyingshields and vanished across the seas. Up until now it’s been a mystery as towhere they went, but the accounts all point to a non-terrestrial source. Asstrange as it may seem to modern ears, Orion may well be the ultimate missingland.Ancient cultures do not seem to mourn the gods’ lack of physical presencebecause they understand there is little difference between physical andnon-physical states, it’s all a matter of shifting one’s perspective andadapting accordingly, thus they are comfortable in maintaining the umbilicalcord of communication through shamanic means. The Waitaha call it MindJourneying: “The ancient ones sent their minds and spirits soaring insideenvelopes of thought, and the sounds contained in the words had carefully beenselected for just such a mind journey. Te Rere Wairua [the flight of the spirit]enabled them to communicate their requests to the ancient elders. The eldersutilized a form of fasting in their preparation, and during this time theremainder of the process was locked very carefully inside the inner teachings ofthe Waitaha Wananga [university of learning], under the strictest control of theteachers and healers.”19The point is reiterated by the Hopi and Zuni, who do not blink when describing atime in the remote past when contact with the katsinam Watchers was physical,and how nowadays the interaction is subtle, even though, on occasion, physicalcontact still takes place. This implies the Lords of Anu really did possesscontrol of the laws of nature to the point where they were able to morph theirphysical state. As Enoch the scribe himself remarked, \"the Watchers could takeon human form when they wanted to,”20 just as the Mahabharata and Puranas ofIndia make the same comment about the Naga and how they could assume human formwhen a situation demanded it — such as a global cataclysm."},{"pageContent":"> 19.

We can deduce two things from this behavior: one, theywished future generations to know there once existed an advanced civilizationwho reached its apogee in astronomy, mathematics, telluric sciences andspirituality to create a golden age across a swathe of the Earth; and two, theywished to remind us, lest we forgot, that the near-destruction of the Earth iscyclical, its recurrence is part and parcel of life on this planet, it is anaccepted line item on the contract of incarnation. Obliteration occurred before,it will again, and life resumes. Why else build megalithic structures that defycataclysms and common sense unless they are meant to serve as building blocksfor the survivors? Why else did these enlightened people work with complexcalendrical systems marking vast tracks of time when simple agriculturalcalendars would have sufficed?Western religion treats humans as sinners the moment their umbilical cord issevered and labels every natural catastrophe a sure sign of divine retribution.Any belief system founded on such fearmongering serves no one except those whocreated it in the first place. As religious books go, the Qur’an may not beperfect either, but at least it makes an important distinction between thewarning of a grievous day and a grievous punishment, and the applied Arabic termmeans a day that would be remembered for generations to come as a futurewarning.3 My direct experience of ancient temples coupled with the words of theancestors tells me that all we have read up to this point in this adventure ispreparation for a major overhaul.DISTANT EARLY WARNINGWith rare exceptions, as a society we stopped building sacred sites after 200 BC— at least according to their original recipe and purpose. No longer are templesbuilt over the intersecting paths of the Earth’s telluric currents,4 nor aretheir proportions designed to influence the human biological field, nor do theystimulate its consciousness.5 In their stead we have erected facsimilespromoting ideologies that do next to nothing to advance the spiritualdevelopment of the human race. By its very nature the word religio means‘reconnect with the source’, and yet religion is often designed to achieve thevery opposite. The consequences have proved disastrous, because one of thepurposes of the original megalithic sites was to create environments where theperceived distance between the individual and subtler levels of existence isreduced. We have lost contact with the land, the sky, ourselves and, ultimately,with the gods who assisted us on this present experience.As I illustrated earlier, it is believed by indigenous people the world overthat contact with the Watchers and other sages by-and-large stopped taking placeon a physical level some time ago, resuming instead through subtler means. Butjust because one no longer possesses a physical body doesn’t mean one can’t beuseful. As the Watcher Sótuknang once reminded the Hopi, “you will have helpfrom the proper deities... Just keep your own doors open.\"6 So it is reassuringto know that the Watchers are very much involved at this present time.Since the late 1970s indigenous wisdom keepers have assisted researchers such asmyself come to grips with perhaps the most wondrous, most artistic form ofcommunication taking place on this planet right now. The subject of crop circlesraises excitement and ire in equal proportions when broached. My first bookSecrets In The Fields painstakingly lays out the evidence that crop circles werecreated by an intelligent consciousness, and the unusual anomalies upon whichthe designs are made are incapable of being reproduced by people: cellularchanges in plants, their bending without damage, the superheating of liquid in afraction of a second, alteration of the local electro-magnetic and geomagneticfield, and manipulation of soil chemistry are just a few. To save repeatingmyself I will merely direct you to the evidence presented in the book, if onlyat least to dispel the false impression that the phenomenon is perpetuated bypeople. Such an idea was borne from the careful crafting by elements within theBritish Secret Service to debunk the subject just as it was gaining worldwidetraction, even among the quality press. The idea of a fraud was proved to be afraud in itself, misdirection with the intent of manipulating the public’sperception.7The central thesis focuses on the creators of the mysterious symbols, whoidentified themselves to indigenous wisdom keepers and others who ‘keep theirdoors open’. To quote one of the many communications: “You ask the meaning ofyour circles in the fields. You have been made aware of the presence of theWatchers. Watchers is a name of a collective intelligence which guides youmortal humans. It is an intelligence from outside the planet… We have beencoming for years and years in physical form, and this has happened many times…We have communicated before many times, usually through thought processes, butnow it needs to be seen.”8And the signs certainly caught the world’s attention, especially when themajority of the original crop glyphs began clustering around a conical man-madehill in southern Britain named Silbury, literally Hill of the Shining One.9 Theassociation couldn’t be more obvious. Early glyphs resemble petroglyphs found inNative American territories, which themselves reference the Lookers, orWatchers. One extraordinary crop glyph near Alton Barnes in 1990 — an event madefamous when it depleted most car batteries in that hamlet — resembles apetroglyph carved near First Mesa in Arizona depicting the flying shields of thekatcinam. With its circles and connecting avenues, the glyph indicatescommunication between the upper and lower worlds, using symbolic language knownto indigenous peoples.[images/00171.jpg]Alton Barnes crop glyph. Note similarities to the flying shield petroglyph andits adjacent panel.I am condensing a very complex subject into manageable paragraphs because neverin my wildest moments did it cross my mind to add crop circles to a projectconcerned with the nature of antediluvian gods and their domains. However, whilewriting this closing chapter it dawned on me that I’ve been sitting on a vitalpiece of information for over twenty years whose enormity only now becomesapparent. And it makes for sober reading.Five years after the Alton Barnes glyph, a rural field named Longwood Warren,near the English town of Winchester, hosted an exceptional 240-foot diametercrop glyph, a replica of the inner solar system right down to the planetaryorbit ratios around the Sun, each indicated by a majestic sweep of thin, barelyeight-inches wide rings made of standing plants; a necklace of sixty-sevengrapeshot circles plus three outlying circles represent the asteroid belt, thatthick ring of debris orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. The information is 99percent accurate, so whoever was behind this artwork is proficient in astronomy— not to mention geometry, mathematics and sound because Euclidean theorems anddiatonic ratios are concealed in its design matrix.10[images/00172.jpg]Longwood Warren crop glyph depicts the inner solar system with a missing Earth.The overlay shows its well-calculated Euclidean geometry. The area between theasteroids and inner perimeter is defined by a square, whose mathematical ratiogenerates the musical note D (second octave).[images/00173.jpg]The author was bent on communicating an important piece of information becauseall the planets are accounted for except the Earth, which is missing. The puzzlenagged scientists and researchers alike for months. Then, an astronomer versedin Euclidean mathematics and a passion for Stonehenge examined the glyph. Thelate Gerald Hawkins, Astronomer General of Boston University, took the exactalignment of planets indicated by the glyph and calculated the two occasionsduring the twentieth century when their positions appeared as such in the solarsystem. The first, November 6, 1903, is remembered as the day the Wrightbrothers proved at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, that, given wings, man could fly.The second, July 11, 1971, marked another milestone in flight: Mariner 9, thefirst spacecraft ever to orbit Mars, was making its way to our red neighbor.The analysis was fascinating yet hardly earth shattering. Why should theWatchers wish to commemorate our past achievements in aviation?One plausible theory was that by providing a freeze-frame of the sky and linkingit to two notable historical events, the design might be communicating a futuredate, not least because the sixty-seven year span between the two eventscoincides with the number of ‘asteroids’ in the design, placing the nextconjunction in 2038. But still the nagging thought, why was the Earth missing?Was the glyph’s appearance in the middle of June, amid the second Taurid stream,more than a coincidence?WHEN THE SKY FALLSIf the earlier chapter on the Taurids kept you awake at night, perhaps you mightconsider reading this part in daylight. Perseverance shall be rewarded with apotential happy ending.Unlike others of its kind, the Taurid stream is filled with massive chunks ofdebris hurtling through space at phenomenal speed. Among the kamikaze rocks ofthis dross is a 3-mile wide remnant of comets Encke and Rudnicki, along with avolatile Earth-crossing projectile by the name of Olijato, first observed in1876. These are accompanied by “one to two hundred asteroids of more than akilometer in diameter.”11 As the astrophysicists Clube and Napier bluntly pointout, “this unique complex of debris is undoubtedly the greatest collision hazardfacing the Earth at the present time.”12If all this makes for sombre reading then consider that Clube and Napier’sresearch further reveals a 19-mile wide behemoth orbiting the heart of theTaurid stream, invisible to optical equipment due to its current inert behavior,and will remain so until gases building up inside are released, making theobject visible once again. Large fragments accompany this giant, all of whichpose extreme danger to Earth. To quote Professor Emilio Spedicato, amathematician with a passion for celestial mechanics: “It is predicted that...around the year 2030, the Earth will again cross that part of the torus thatcontains the fragments, an encounter that in the past has dramatically affectedmankind.”13This brings into sharp focus the reason why barely a month goes by without spaceagencies issuing press releases announcing a new asteroid, a meteor or someother near-Earth projectile, the irony being they now share the same obsessionwith the sky as did the gods of old.We are hardly clueless to near-extinction scenarios. There exists evidence insupport of devastating meteorite impacts in 7600 BC, 4400 BC, 3150 BC, 2345 BC,1628 BC, 1159 BC, 207 BC, 536 AD and 1178 AD;14 there is additional mountingevidence of extraterrestrial plasma events which sometimes occurred in tandemwith impacts. These electrical events are caused by gamma ray outbursts fromstellar phenomena or by mass coronal ejections from the Sun. They causeextraordinary displays of light phenomena, intense heat, incineration offlammable material, melting of ice caps and vaporization of water. One incidentknown as the Carrington Event occurred as recently as 1859 and damaged 130,000miles of telegraph cables throughout Britain; some operators were electrocuted,while others were able to operate equipment without power due to the extrainduced current.And that was a relatively minor outburst.15 In 1989 a billion-ton cloud of gasand plasma ejected from the Sun with the energy of thousands of nuclear bombs.Within hours, six million people in Canada found themselves without electricity.They should consider themselves fortunate, in earlier times one particularstrike was so intense it vitrified stonework, buildings, even entire ancientcities. Some well-researched cases can be seen in the so-called hill forts ofScotland, Wales, Germany and Turkey,16 many of which were used as sacred placesas early as 8000 BC. Evidence suggests such an intense burst of heat would havebeen made possible by a bolide, an incoming projectile blowing apart in theatmosphere, generating destruction over wide area, as was the case in 1908 aboveTunguska which, incidentally, took place when the Earth again crossed theTaurids. A similar incident in the 6th century altered the climate sufficientlyto cause crop failures, plagues and devastation that ushered the Dark Ages inEurope.THE END OF THE WORLD IS (MAYBE) NIGHBy now it should be crystal clear why antediluvian architects were obsessed withthe sky and why they built megalithic structures engineered to withstand tenthousand years of pillage and politics, into which they poured the sum of theirexperience, reminding future generations of the importance of understanding notjust a shared evolutionary journey, but also the Earth’s place in own celestialdrama.It seems to me the gods also wished to warn of the danger of complacency. Theyexperienced global upheaval — twice — and enough individuals survived the secondto promulgate the knowledge that rekindled human civilization, reminding us thatnothing in life really dies, it merely reconstitutes and reinvents itself. Thenon-event that was the end of the world on the winter solstice of 2012 servedone useful purpose beside promoting prophets of doom: it demonstrated why theancients marked time in great cycles. The most important feature of themisinterpreted Mayan Calendar is not a firm date for global calamity, but rathera pivotal moment within a sixty-year window stretching from approximately 1982to 2042 — coincidentally spanning the dates calculated by professors Hawkins andSpedicato, and indicated by the crop glyph. It merely reflects the motion of onecycle as it dissipates into another. During such periods the Earth falls underthe influence of changes taking place in the machinery of heaven, when orderturns to chaos and chaos returns to order, much like the change in tides at thebeach. One such mechanism involves the Earth overturning on its axis, \"the earthturned upside down,\"17 as the Egyptians say on the Harris and Ipuwer papyri. Astragic as this may have been, it is reassuring to know that although the onlyconstants in the universe are order and chaos, the higher the level of chaos thegreater the potential jump to a higher level of order.We have already seen how the Maya inherited complex calendars from people who’dacquired long-term observation of the cycles of the heavens and the benefits andharm such motions bring. According to the Maya, the previous age was destroyedby flood, and this present cycle is predicted to close with global destructionby fire and earthquakes. The clock began ticking for this age c.3114 BC, a dateroughly coinciding with a comet or plasma event c.3150 BC that impacted climateworldwide. By the same token, the previous cycle began around 8240 BC,coinciding with the ‘sudden’ global outbreak of agriculture and civilization.Another mechanism at work is the geomagnetic reversal of the poles, the last onehaving occurred around 10,400 BC,18 the period commemorated by a number of theworld's oldest monuments. The next is expected to take place around 2030.19If the expression May You Live in Interesting Times is anything to go by, thethird decade of the twenty-first century is shaping up to prove it.Ancient cosmologies mark the passing of each age and its associated catastrophewith the symbol of a new Sun. The Maya refer to these as Fire Sun, HurricaneSun, Earthquake Sun, Water Sun. By comparison, Nahua tradition listsChicon-tonatiuh or seven Sun cycles forming an annular cosmic drama,20 as do theaborigines of North Borneo;21 Buddhist scriptures, whose six previous Suns wereeach brought to an end by water, fire or wind, state that this present seventhsun will end with the Earth breaking into flames, a view shared by theaborigines of Sarawak.The Visuddhi Magga and the Bahman Yast, two books of the Avesta claimed to spanhundreds of thousands of years, similarly describe seven cycles,22 eachbeginning with the cosmic mechanism winding itself up and unravelling at eachclose, accompanied by \"signs, wonders, and perplexity which are manifested inthe world at the end of each millennium.\"23Avestic Aryans of ancient Iran state in their scriptures how the originalhomeland Airyana Vaejo was destroyed at the close of an age defined by adevastating lowering of temperatures that brought ten months of winter acrossthe Earth and with it a period of glaciation. Predictably, a man of high renown— whose wife also happens to be his sister, naturally — was instructed by a godto ride out the snow and bitter cold inside a large underground enclosure, afterwhich built a boat to house all manner of species.24 The story appears to depictclimatic conditions at the onset of the Younger Dryas, and is reiterated by theToba people in the border region of Paraguay and Chile, who recall the samedifficult cold period when the Sun was barely able to warm the Earth.AN OUTCOME NOT SET IN STONEThe Hopi have been foreseeing the future for over a thousand years: peoplespeaking to each other across great distances via spider webs (telephone wires),the riding of wagons without horses on black ribbons (asphalt roads), the gourdof ashes falling to the Earth and burning people (the atomic bomb), the EndTimes people living in the sky (International Space Station). Given such a trackrecord it would be unwise to ignore their knowledge of world ages. The Hopispeak of three previous worlds and are very clear in their description: “Thefirst world was destroyed by fire that came from above and below. The secondworld ended when the terrestrial globe toppled from its axis and everything wascovered with ice. The third world ended in a universal flood. The present worldis the fourth. Its fate will depend on whether or not its inhabitants behave inaccordance with the Creator’s plans.”25Indeed Sótuknang did remind the Hopi at the onset of this current world, “whatyou choose will determine if this time you can carry out the plan of Creation onit or whether it must in time be destroyed too... You will have help from theproper deities, from your good spirits. Just keep your own doors open.\"26 Takenat face value, the advice offered by this Watcher implies the destruction ofthis current world is a potential rather than a foregone conclusion. And this iswhere the good news comes in.On my travels around the world I meet countless people keeping their door openin the face of relentless negativity about the current state of world affairs. Iam encouraged by what I see. At any given moment 95% of the world is at peace, avast improvement from two hundred years ago. Every week inspired people bringnew ideas to fix the environment, from ocean plastic-eating machines to windpowered devices that make drinking water out of thin air. And yet,paradoxically, there is no escaping the brutal fact we are living on borrowedtime. At the time of writing, by early August humans will have consumed more ofnature than the planet is capable of renewing in a whole year. We now findourselves in a situation where the human population is consuming 1.6 planets ayear and the date falls back six days with each passing year.27 For the firsttime in living memory we as a society have forsaken the natural order andembarked on the suppression of nature, abstractionism and mathematical analysisat the expense of observation and empathy, and a divesting of personalresponsibility in favor of artificial intelligence. In short, we are at thethreshold of progressive innovation whilst undermining our biological viability.The balance can tip either way. Since we are an inherent part of nature, when weabuse this connection, nature sends unmistakable warning signals. By way ofanalogy, when we work our own body in ways it is not meant to operate, themuscles and bones turn on the host and cause incalculable pain.It is no different for this biological organism called Earth, and the warningsare loud and clear: overpopulation, environmental degradation, resourcedepletion and famine, to which NASA and other space agencies add near-Earthasteroids, comets and other projectiles that could spell the end of this FourthWorld, ironically prophesied by the very cultures who, in little over a century,have been almost eradicated at the hand of ‘advanced’ society.During a radio interview in which I was making the point between gods, theintegrity of temple culture and the uplifting of the human condition, there camea moment in the broadcast when we discussed the coincidence between the fall oftemple culture and the fall of civilizations. Uncharacteristically, part of theconversation grew increasingly pessimistic and ended in that most awkwardmoments on live radio — absolute silence — at which point I began to speak offthe cuff, the inspiration just hit me while on air, you could say I had anepiphany. It’s a risk speaking into a live microphone without preparation.Nevertheless I felt compelled.I recalled the aforementioned quote by Sótuknang — that the future isn’t alwayswritten in stone — along with the following flood myth from the region of VietNam, Laos and Thailand. Back in the days when celestial beings and humans couldtravel back and forth to visit one another, when people lived for three hundredyears, and the region was named Muang Lum (Lower World), there lived in northernThailand three unusual lords, Pu Langxoeng, Khun Kan and Khun Khet, earthlyrepresentatives of a celestial being named Thaen. All that Thaen required wasfor people to honor him at meal times and follow the rules set down for goodconduct. But gradually the three lords neglected this simple courtesy, they fellout of favor with the heavens, and a great flood wiped out everyone andeverything — except the three lords, who built a raft, took aboard their wivesand children, and met Thaen in the sky, reassuring him they had learned fromtheir error and from now on they would be more respectful.Thaen agreed and sent down a messenger to teach people all the crafts necessaryupon which to build a civil society.Soon the Earth became overpopulated and the three lords took to regularintoxication. This time Thaen recalled the lords and replaced them with hismessenger Khun Bulom and seven sages. When Thaen was convinced the people couldlook after themselves once more, he had the bridge to heaven collapsed so thathumans could no longer visit.28The central point to the story is not how it echoes so many other accounts we’vealready covered, it’s the one small detail about Thaen retracting the bridge toheaven. It brought to mind all the traditions in which the Watchers and othersof their ilk sowed the seeds of civilization then disappeared across the sea,never to be seen again in physical form, thereafter appearing sporadically ornot at all, then abruptly making their presence known at the close of thetwentieth century through messages encoded in crop glyphs.29My point is this. Long ago humans established a relationship with gods who, onoccasion, would feed morsels of knowledge in what seems to have been a carefullyorchestrated plan to assist human society evolve gradually towards a morecivilized state; on occasion they would allow a lucky individual into theirworld so the person could share a favourable impression with his peers uponreturn. Looking at the myriad of ancient cultures and their stories, as aspecies it seems we ultimately relied on outside assistance, perhaps to thepoint of dependency, especially after each overturning of the world. So myquestion is, what if the lesson to be learned in this present age is to discoverthe spark of divinity in ourselves, to recognize the god within? Was Sótuknangdaring humans to do better, was he offering us a challenge?THE POWER OF HUMAN POTENTIALWhat if by losing our connection to divine assistance we discover our ownsupernatural potential?Tibetan Buddhist monks are no strangers to the extraordinary, such as using thebody to heat freezing water by simply applying the power of thought andintention. Seated in meditation in a drafty monastery one mid-winter, monks tookpart in an experiment, draped in sheets drenched in cold water despite the airtemperature being already close to freezing, and yet, instead of freezing, themonks began to sweat, to the point where the sheets dried within an hour. TheHarvard cardiologist Herbert Benson monitored the event.30 Such is the abilityof ancient traditions like Buddhism and Qigong to place particular emphasis onpeak attention and guided intent to achieve the extraordinary.The energy inherent in thought and emotion has been the subject of recentexperiments on the nature of consciousness. A group of scientists working atPrinceton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) demonstrated how globalcollective consciousness had a marked affect on a computer’s output hours priorto tragic incidents, such as the terrorist attack on the twin towers in New Yorkin 2001, as though a psychokinetic effect was experienced by six billion peopleworldwide. Clearly an event of great magnitude unified world consciousness evenbefore it occurred. The implications reveal important details about humanconsciousness. First, a collective group appears to have a psychokinetic effecton any micro-physical process; second, the effect of a greater number of peopleholding the same intent is stronger than a single person’s, with an impendingcatastrophe corralling people’s focus and inherent ability like no other.Essentially it was proved that an event of great magnitude is capable of unitingworld attention.31The PEAR experiments were expanded to measure the influence of ancient templeson human consciousness. They revealed that an Egyptian temple by itself iscapable of generating an energy field equal to that of a meditating group, andyet the results were highest when such a group interacted with the temple.32This interrelationship between people and megaliths was further discovered whenacoustical analysis of monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hypogeumof Hal Safflieni in Malta, and Newgrange in Ireland show each one to have beendesigned to a specific frequency which is proven to shut down the mentalprocessing area of the brain and switch it towards an active receptive state ofconsciousness.33 The Followers of Horus, the Anunaki, the People of the Serpent,the Watchers and every other brotherhood would hardly have built such places anddescribed them as locations that transform the individual into a god, into abright star unless they wished humans to discover their co-creative potentialand evolve beyond their perceived physical limitation.[images/00174.jpg]Temples such as Luxor are proven to emit as much energy as that created by agroup of people in meditation.What if intention were added to this equation? A number of high profile caseshave shown how intent is capable of affecting a given target. One earlypeer-reviewed intention experiment involved a group of sixteen volunteers inLondon who were able to influence biophoton emission in single-celled algaecalled acetabularia stored in a laboratory run by the scientist Fritz Popp — inGermany.34PEAR took the concept to the next stage. Conducting a group of people focussedon the same aim, their combined intent was shown to influence the output of acomputer to the point where it became possible to alter a regular electronicdrumbeat.35If people united by a single thought can do this to a machine, how about theirenvironment? In 1998, 15% of the Brazilian state of Roraima succumbed to anout-of-control fire. Over 1500 firefighters from three countries joined in toquell the flames, all to no avail. 13,200 square miles of land were torched.Then, experts in weather modification were flown in: two Caipo Indian shamans.Two days after a ritual dance, the heavens opened, rain poured in abundance and90% of the fire was extinguished.36Since the 1960s, over 500 studies conducted by the Maharishi Effect ofTranscendental Meditation have been shown to reduce conflict and suffering. Themost notable were performed using directed group focus targeting American citiesduring times of high crime. One study of twenty-four cities showed that whenever1% of the population was engaged in transcendental meditation, the crime ratedropped 24%. In a follow-up study of forty-eight cities, half of those with therequisite 1% of meditators experienced a 22% decrease in crime and an 89%decrease in the crime trend. In the other half of cities without the thresholdpercentage of meditators, crime increased by 2% and the crime trend by 53%.37[images/00175.jpg]Maharishi Manesh Yogi, who introduced the Trancendental Meditation techniqueIf just one percent of the population of a city is capable of influencing itsenvironment, by extension it would take just over 8000 people to affect theentire world — or less if the level of focussed intent is intense, as proved bythe PEAR experiments and the Tibetan monks.38 Since we are now aware that theuniverse is not a series of isolated events but an interrelatedmechanism-organism, and our thoughts and intent are capable of influencing theworld around us, surely it would be possible to influence the potential courseof, say, an earthbound meteor?Suppose one day the world wakes up to news of a space agency declaring, withabsolute certainty, civilization as we know it is about to end due to anunavoidable collision with a large space rock — the kind of story alreadyrolling out with ever greater frequency yet picked up only by an audience withan interest in such matters. On rare occasions, when such objects pass betweenthe Moon and Earth, the press release makes international headlines. But what ifone day that bulletin offered even odds of annihilation? As history, and nowexperiments in consciousness show, it often takes an incident of globalproportion to galvanize the world into action. At first glance our presentsituation may look fractured beyond repair, but given such a scenario I wonderif the validation of the supernatural power latent in the human temple, weldedto a sign of mutually assured destruction, is enough to generate a bulwark ofenergy capable, in all likelihood, of affecting and altering the outcome of anincoming cosmic monster, and in the process unite this dysfunctional humanbrotherhood?Probably.Besides selectees in laboratories and monks, we know there exist others whoalready understand how the universe works and how it can be tailored by themagical power of concentrated will. We called such individuals by many names butthey all belonged to the same guild. One of them was the Lord of Anu, who onceconfided in Enoch, \"the things which you see at rest and in motion werecompleted by me. I will tell you now… what things I created from thenon-existent, and what visible things from the invisible.\"39 That’s quite thepower.Perhaps what the antediluvian gods might have wanted with us all along was forus to discover the very same power within ourselves, to develop the gumption toalter the course of our own destiny and thus discover, in the end, that we tooare gods.[images/00176.jpg][images/00177.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"> NOTES[images/00178.jpg]CHAPTER 11.
