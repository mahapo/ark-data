We alsooften write how many years ago it was from the present, but we do not use themodern forms of BP (Before Present), BCE (Before Common Era—before year 1), CE(Common Era—from year 1 onwards) or any other abbreviation. Height System Heights are in feet and inches and often shortened to “ft” and “in.” In theGazetteer we use abbreviated form of (for example) 8’ 6” to describe a height ofeight feet six inches. Height is discussed frequently in this book so we havedecided not to submit pages and pages of data on height averages over themillennia. However, for the purposes of clarification, we regard a “giant” asanyone 7 feet tall or over. We do have some examples that are between 6 and 7feet as we felt their inclusion is important to the context of the relevantchapter or book as a whole.The tallest recorded human in history (for whom there is irrefutable evidence)was Robert Wadlow (1918 –1940), who reached 8 feet 11.1 inches in height. American Spelling The general spelling is based on the American dictionary. Although this was atough choice for one of the authors—the Englishman who all his life has spokenand written in the Queen’s English—we decided to honour (sorry, honor) theAmerican form of English, as the book is mainly based on discoveries in NorthAmerica (although some English spelling made its way into the book too).

So many libraries,museums, private residences, and cemeteries have been visited in our effortsthat if you added-on all the interviewing of knowledgeable people, the listwould go on for pages and pages.Jim and Bill Vieira, Hugh Newman, and prolific researcher Micah Ewers are likelions that have championed the cause of the continuing retrieval of informationdealing with an overly fantasized, intellectually marginalized, andprofessionally ostracized sector of humanity. These four men and others whoshare their vision are doing something that literally requires courage to darepresent publicly in this age of academically controlled archaeologies.In a fairer world, our researches would without doubt have benefitted from thekeyed-in professors of anthropology who would already have thoroughly documentedthe extensive tenure of the tall people in the ancient Americas, Europe, andplaces of the East. However by some strange twisting-about of luck probablyreflecting the mediocre development of social justice and intellectual honesty,it has become the responsibility of our researches to bear the burdensubstantiating a populace who often stood upwards from seven feet in height withproportionate figures. More to the point, the professional ethnologists of theworld should perhaps be explaining the missing skeletons along with loss ofcontext supporting the tall people’s existence, not us.And missing they are. For a number of sound reasons, the bones are hardlyaccessible for the court of research science. These reasons include thefanatical leveling of scores-of-thousands of Indian graves beginning in earliestcolonial times seeking artifacts to sell as well as clear the land for farmingand towns. The chemically delicate condition of the older skeletons is noted insome of the accounts as the blackening processes of oxygen disintegrated thebones before the eyes of the exhuming parties. But there was also the sillypractice of disarticulation to isolate the skulls and long bones of large sizefor turnover to collectors curating evidence of anomalies. Add to these pointsthe dark aspects of racial prejudice and the understanding that Native peoplewere without rights alive or dead, and you have a mojo cocktail of whitesectarianism that would disorient even the most sober and reliable jurist.And this is no joking matter, for so repressed has this information been that itbelies the public knowledge—something that should be unconscionable today. Theseforgotten folk, many of whom would be as giants if they walked among us now,lived not only in America’s past, but as other evidence points, many parts ofthe ancient world. As Hugh explains ahead, some of their stories are so very oldthey have reverted to legend, folk tradition, classical myth, and even fable.Our work here is a straightforward attempt at restoring to the light of commonacceptance the evident existence of these people. As becomes obvious in much ofHugh and Jim’s chronicles, peerage social systems featuring men and women oflarge stature in pre-contact America proliferate among our best sources. Thatcoupled with an astute exposé of a concerted effort within an early twentiethcentury National Museum to apparently do away with the bones and falsely declarethese people never existed, has placed our efforts more in the frame of aservice worthy for the sake of an historical narrative.There was a sort of cottage industry mania in the later nineteenth century—acraze that so alarmed the National Museum and related concerns that they took itupon themselves to upturn, loot, and leave to the elements the great majority ofremaining Indian cemeteries throughout the east and central United States. Theonly criteria was that they showed some promise of significant artifactualcaches.In perspective of the time, the universities had not yet developed anyarchaeological programs, so all was undertaken by interested men, includingfortunately some trained physicians and others of background in the sciences ofthe time. Although their activities weren’t inclusive enough (by means ofdisciplines involved) to stem the tide of bigotry and loss of compassion forNative folk, it has helped us a modicum to get a reasonable grasp on theenormity of the problem. Yes, Native people were often considered to be somewhatsub-human, a dark projection that is even today in the process of completeeradication. Now we appeal to the reader to take a moment to reflect on the easewith which the undercurrents of early American racial discrimination influencedthe public imagination to the point of permitting settled efforts at writinghistory with extreme prejudice. Origins of the Tall Ones According to the Native accounts, e.g. the early French and Spanish—as well asnot a few of the sources documenting the physical condition of the nativeleadership’s remains, these people were, by-and-large, comely and attractive tothe eye. Some of their ancient folk traditions held that they were, (as claimalso some traditional Japanese), descended from a race of divinely endowedbeings, but had through disgrace lost the mastery of earth-and-sky, devolvingrapidly to plain mortals. At a time not as long ago as one might believe, awiser humanity stewarded the earth to the condition of a true paradise. Thepeople, fauna, and flora lived far longer than now, and as they became older,they continued to grow incrementally. The period of a person’s youth took a verylong time to fade. “.…They stated that the bones belonged to one of the big buffaloes, which roamedover the plains during the times of their fathers. At that period, the HappyHunting Ground was on earth, but was afterward removed beyond the clouds by theGreat Spirit, to punish his children for bad conduct.”1 There was a hallowing element stirred by the wind and waters in those days thatis all but absent today. It is remembered across the globe as mana or manna, bymeans of which Nature achieved true balance. With the agricultural arts of aspiritually enhanced landscape millennia ago, the mana rose as the source ofvital sustenance impregnating the vegetation, revealing all vestigialaspects—allowing very tall and well-endowed people to appear for a time andthrive. All this has been taken from our comprehension as we struggle withrestoring the subconscious memory of our humanity.Now this also may be an important point to grasp: without the mana in the water,soil, and air vitalizing and perfecting the living plants and trees, the peoplein time saw their orènda degrade in potency and dissipate. Likened to the EastIndian ojás, orènda was in part definable as the most spirited essence born ofnourishment enabling the performance of otherwise formidable tasksintellectually and physically.The progressively retreating power of the divine orènda in short orderrestricted the vision of the internal world, and in a remarkably brief periodthe general populations descended from possession of supernal wisdom to simplehuman traits. It is said as well that this spiritual power’s loss was hastenedthrough sexual sporting with both sexes responsible for the laxity. They foundthemselves diminishing in stature, diminishing in years; but perhaps with alltallied, the greatest loss of all was memory—a senility that seems to haveaffected the entire human race. “They suppose their ancestors to have been more perfect, both in intellectual &bodily formation, than the present race. They were of very large stature, bothmen and women, attributed in part to their abstinence from sexual intercourseduring the early years of life. In those days the men at a hundred years wereequal to those of the present race at seventy. A gradual degeneration has atlast brought them to their present state and is now working imperceptibly amongall the Indian tribes.” 2 Vine Deloria (in Red Earth, White Lies) notes that even within the memory ofsome Indian people, the age of 200 years was attained—and perhaps notuncommonly. After the disengagement of the mánitou systems’ gathering arms oflinear earthen and stone walls punctuated with artificial mounds and terminuscaves to polarize and convert the land’s magnetic flows in maintenance of themana, the people knew great difficulty wanting for the reestablishment of areliably potent orènda. A similar story seems to have happened throughoutprehistoric Britain and around the world where standing stones, dolmens, andtemple structures were operated by people who yet grasped the workings of a verysubtle yet understated magnetic field. A Tradition of Tall People In America the bones that we have found evidence for—the ones theanthropologists and museum curators say never existed—were in feasible theorythose of the generations that had instituted the protocols of selective marriageto stay the will of nature. In this way it is believed they may have at leastoutwardly retained some resemblance to their revered forebears of precedingmillennia. But it was also held, it would seem, that their children’s orènda washopefully kept preserved by this means (the creation of lineages), and so theoffspring of the noble class were carefully protected against worldly influencesuntil a certain age. Nonetheless, and although it seems to have worked to keepstrength and tallness in families, selective mating in hindsight crafted anartificial suspension—an effort that postponed what nature odds-on wouldotherwise have dictated as fated. Yet it is fortunate for us to have been leftthese important clues as artifacts that, suitably discerned, leave us withworking answers pertinent to the origins of the Tall Ones as a once worldwidesocial phenomenon. “Measurements taken of the skeleton while still in the grave indicated anindividual approximately 7.2 feet tall. He would have been a splendid figure inany society and the darling of a primitive basketball team.” 3 The bones we have uncovered seem large to us: seven-footers can be imposing evenon a professional basketball court. It seems quite apparent the indigenouspeople had been practicing deliberate and selective intermarriage among familiesthat had tall members—a social phenomenon in some respects akin to some Europeanroyal families in centuries passed. Unlike in Europe however, instead of seekingout wealth and power as a first cause, the native folk of the Eastern Woodlandssought robust physicality as a motive for establishing their leaders—this beingan indication of descent from a venerable stock of elite status known to exhibitadministrative talents. It was from these people that their public figures weredeveloped—wealth and power coming along in due course.An additional important factor of the tall people having survived seems to bethat the woodlands of North America were abundant with food and open spaces tothe degree that wars were not fought as often as they were upon otherterritories around the ancient globe. Such conditions coupled with theirbelieved hierarchically structured village systems giving leeway to an overallegalitarian vision, may have stayed the grand stature resulting in so many suchskeletal remains being witnessed by the European settlers in the Eastern U.S.Since the rest of the world’s larger and stronger men were often enough placedon the front lines of battle throughout Asia and Europe, that version of DNA wasnot as available for procreation, and the populations of larger men knew steadydepletion; while in America, conditions may have favored the survival of thevery tall, allowing their numbers to remain considerable as evinced throughtheir oral traditions.Sadly, though consistently birthing some commanding and muscular individuals,uncounted generations practicing selective breeding may in theory haveexacerbated an already impaired immune response to the European smallpox. Hereis conceivably a measure of irony, for if not for the poxes the Europeansbrought, who knows how things may have turned out for the Native populations? Ignorance, Racial Intolerance, and Conspiracy Bear in mind that ‘giant’ is used herein more in the spirit of, though not as, ahomonym, i.e. having more than one aspect, which Hugh and Jim explain ahead inbetter perspective. I’ve never been completely comfortable with the use of theterm ‘giant’ to describe these people because the term was once and has againbecome a tool of academics agreeable to further berating the last vestiges ofinformation concerning the reality of the people of whom this book treats.Without much critical thought, these men are willingly extending themisanthropies of their predecessors through certain fields of education andcommunication, further abetting the abject racial bias already too long leveledagainst our indigenous people. Overwhelmed by the mass-marketed science oftoday, the fact of our Native ancestry’s physicality being superior in manyrespects to the populations of today is treated as nonsense.Left unchallenged, notorious characters like the twentieth century’s AlešHrdlička of the National Museum (see chapter 8) will appear from time to timeemploying presentist philosophy in declaring the belief in exceptional staturein ancient times insulting to anyone of intelligence. Even now a correct viewover the past is blocked by men who, though long dead, influence academiathrough partialities that support some current models. Advancements intechnology may help in some respects to be rid of these shadows—but notalways—in that interpretation can be imperceptibly tainted with old concepts.Any time hypotheses of ancient Native folk are put up by non-Indians, there toooften we still see adherence to well established party lines that throughpreference have survived from the nineteenth century. Good examples of this kindof Jim Crow mentality are not hard to find because even just a century ago, suchan attitude flourished in virtually every university.So could there have been a conspiracy headed by a ranking anthropologist seatedin Washington, D.C. to gather and remove, on a permanent basis, evidence of anadmirably robust and otherwise remarkable race or (sub-race) of people? Thefollowing chapters as thoughtfully arranged by Hugh and Jim may provide a clearand obvious answer to that question. Bearing in mind that such remains werealready long missing from other regions of the world, we can see how it may havebeen a relatively easy affair to control and censure the anomalies of our NativeAmerican burial sanctuaries.In sum, basically any way we look at it, the real problem may ultimately lie inthe inability for men to leave courteously alone the established libraries,repositories, and cemeteries of the world’s past. It has been out of our regularsevering of connections with past histories that we have found ourselves nobetter off than orphans having no knowledge of our parents. This book is aneffort toward amending that problem. Bless us all with the wisdom of our ancestorsRoss Hamilton, September 2015 "},{"pageContent":"Preface Recently an article from a satirical website claimed that a Supreme Court rulingforced the Smithsonian Institution to admit to the historic destruction ofthousands of giant bones. It was published not long after the Search for theLost Giants TV show had aired with a headline that read: “Smithsonian Admits toDestruction of Thousands of Giant Human Skeletons in Early 1900s.”1 The articlewas convincing, and this apparent exposé of the National Museum hit a chord withpeople. Straight away, we were inundated with emails from people believing thestory was real.If such a story were true it would be front-page worldwide news. However, whenan Internet post is mentioning a startling find and not verifying any of theprofessionals involved, real organizations orinstitutions they belong to, you can quickly conclude that it is amisrepresentation of facts. Maybe someday, however, the Smithsonian will admitto the irony of this story.The over willingness to believe seems to be the culprit for such stories gaininglife. This is the reality we have had to deal with in writing this book, ashoaxes and exagerations were often reported as the truth. This is a challengingsubject to research because of the lack of physical evidence and the moral andethical implications of investigating human remains. When the Native AmericanGraves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was passed in 1990, anyremaining giant skeletons and bones were removed from public display and buriedaccording to the traditions of individual tribes. We often get asked “where arethe bones?” and we reply “ask the Smithsonian and the Native Americans.”Even with these obstacles, we have done our best to chase down every account tothe end and to be as impartial as possible. This book is not trying to be a longscientific paper but an assemblage of data and documents that have been hiddenin libraries and local historical societies, and quietly shunned by academia forthe last two centuries. Unfortunately several hoaxes clouded serious researchinto the existence of giants, so it is perhaps pertinent to look at some ofthese deceptions, as they have become the bane of researchers seeking the truthof the North American giants. The Cardiff Giant The Cardiff Giant was one of the most famous hoaxes in United States history.Purportedly, it was a 10-foot-long “petrified man,” uncovered on October 16,1869 by workers digging a well behind the barn of William C. ‘Stub’ Newell inCardiff, New York. Both it and an unauthorized copy made by P. T. Barnum arestill on display. The giant was the creation of a New York tobacconist, atheistGeorge Hull, who decided to create the giant after an argument at a Methodistrevival meeting about Genesis 6:4 stating that there were giants who once livedon Earth. Hull hired men to carve out a 10 feet, 4.5 inch long block of gypsumin Fort Dodge, Iowa, telling them that it was intended for a monument to AbrahamLincoln in New York. He shipped the block to Chicago, where he hired EdwardBurghardt, a German stonecutter, to carve it into the likeness of a man andswore him to secrecy. It was later exposed as an elaborate fraud.MF-CardiffGiant.jpg [../Images/image00287.jpeg] The Martindale MummiesYosemite Valley, California The controversial Martindale Mummies were said to have been discovered 1n 1885,in California’s Yosemite Valley. A team of miners led by G.F. Martindalereported finding the remains of a woman nearly seven feet tall, who was holdinga mummified child. The mummies were claimed to have been found in a cave behinda wall of rock.The Mummies were acquired by Ripley’s in February 1998 from Dr. Larry Cartmell(Ripley’s Believe It or Not! is a franchise founded by Robert Ripley in 1918that collects strange artifacts). The mother and child mummies were firstdisplayed in Scranton, Kansas in 1899. The origin and authenticity of theMartindale Mummies remained a mystery for a long time but in 1996 simple x-raysand CT scans of the mummy quickly revealed it was a sideshow fake that had donethe rounds for half a century.martindale-mummy2.jpg [../Images/image00288.jpeg] 9- Foot MummyThe Anderson Intelligencer, December 4, 1895Cartersville, Georgia This is a report of a 9-foot-tall mummy being housed at the court of Judge EdgarOrr of Atlanta. The mummy was at a museum on Decatur Street after a financialdispute closed down the museum. We have read dozens of newspaper articles andbook entries that described Judge Orr as a respected and prominent judge in theAtlanta area, which made the case initially more interesting. Many peoplestopped in to view the mummy and the article tells us that it had “long coarsehair” and the “huge frame is well proportioned, considering that it is solarge.” We are informed that: “The advertisement has attracted the attention of the Smithsonian Institutiondoctors and professors and that institution has sent several osteologists atdifferent times to make expert examination of the mummy. Dr. Priorleau,Professor Stelle and Professor Lucas all examined the mummy, determined itsauthenticity and concluded it was between 500 and 1000 years old. Theexaminations were made with the intention of purchasing the mummy to put in theNational Museum in Washington D.C. Copies of the advertisement of the sale weretaken by the professors of the National Museum and it is expected thatrepresentatives of the Institution at Washington will be present at the sale ofthe museum next Monday. All the experts who have examined the giant mummy, whichis nearly nine feet in length, think it is a curiosity fit to be placed in theNational Museum.” This mummy also turned out to be a fake after further analysis.Finally, all over the Internet we have the unfortunate remains of a 2002Photoshop contest of giant skeleton creations. The Worth 1000 website hostsnumerous design competitions and in 2002 they featured one focusing on giantskeletons.2 Many of these examples of graphic design have been reported to begenuine by some researchers for over 10 years. They have featured in variousbooks and on the National Geographic website.3hoax-book-pics-grainy.bmp [../Images/image00289.jpeg]In the course of researching this subject, the authors have uncovered hoaxes,exaggerations, mismeasurements, use of faulty regression formulas, other honestmistakes and even downright deceptions. However, those only comprise a smallamount of the reports that we are dealing with. We do not claim that all theaccounts presented in this book are true, but rather present them so the readerscan examine, research and make their own conclusions. We have investigated manyof the accounts to their source, with some coming to a dead-end, so there is noway to verify them. Other (often famous) accounts we found to be hoaxes, whileothers were accurately measured and reported by the Smithsonian and otherwell-known authorities.The story of the North American giants may be consumed by controversy, intrigue,hoaxes, and disinformation, but please take a look for yourself and make up yourown mind, as there are simply too many accounts to ignore.5252.png [../Images/image00290.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum by Hugh Newman Giants have always been part of British culture. Hundreds of legends, stories,folk-tales, and even the chronicles of King Arthur have these ancient godsinvolved, and have been part of a tradition for thousands of years. There arewell-known stories such as Jack-the-Giant-Killer (that later became thefairy-tale Jack and the Beanstalk), Brutus battling with the giant Gogmagog, andthe construction of hundreds of megalithic sites attributed to these beings.Chapbook_Jack_the_Giant_Killer.bmp [../Images/image00291.jpeg]In Europe there are the Ice Giants of Nordic tradition, the Tuatha de Danaan andFormorians of old Ireland,Hu Gadarn of Celtic tradition, Cronus and the Titans of Greece and the one-eyedCyclops of Homer’s tales. Further afield there are the Thunderous Rakshasas ofthe Indian Ramayana, the Gigantes of the Middle East, and even in the Biblethere are matter-of-fact accounts of mighty warriors, and tribes such as theNephilim, Rephaim, Anakim and the Canaanites. Some examples, like King Og ofBashan and Goliath—who was defeated by David—even had their heights described indetail, and were attributed as the builders of megalithic temples in the Biblelands.These traditions have become part of our psyche, and are now the stuff oflegend. Most people believe they are just tales, poems and bedtime stories readto children, startling them with the mighty roar of “Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum”. As they areno longer part of our historical timeline, the giants have been sidelined andabsorbed into the imaginary world. But what if these giant humans really didexist? What if mighty races of titans really did rule parts of the ancientworld?In the past giants were seen as gods, elementals, and aspects of the sacredlandscape, that would bring fertility to the crops, affect weather, and remindus of a greater power beyond our scope of reason. The more one looks into thesetales of old, the more one realises they exist in almost every country on everycontinent. “Everyone is fascinated by the question of whether races of mighty beings onceroamed the earth, shaping the landscape and building huge enclaves of earth andstone which are still associated with their name. Such legends are universal;often they point to magical and meteorological phenomena crediting the giantswith a definite, if dangerous, supernatural ability.” 1 When I was nine years old my family moved to a quaint village on the outskirtsof Cambridge. Cherry Hinton was known for its cherry orchards and privateairport, but not much else. Upon the local Gog Magog Hills, however, legends ofgiants were part of the school playground chatter. There were rumours that agiant was still buried at the sacred spring that was called ‘Giant’s Grave’ or‘Magog’s Grave,’ which has a 20 ft island in the middle of it said to be theresting place of a local titan. It is directly across the street from the RobinHood and Little John Pub. Little John was a legendary giant who accompanied themedieval hero of Nottingham on his escapades through Sherwood Forest. Hisinfluence obviously reached this part of East Anglia too. In the pub’s car parka chunky monolith sits with a mysterious footprint carved in it that to this dayno one knows how it got there or who carved it out.cherryhintonstone.bmp [../Images/image00292.jpeg] When I reached the tender age of twelve I joined Netherhall secondary schoolthat was at the base of Lime Kiln Hill, part of the Gog Magog Downs. Chalkclunch was excavated from this hill and was used for building several of theuniversity buildings on the other side of town. Twice a week our class had toscale the side of the hill as part of physical education, not realising that inthe distant past it was once the abode of mysterious and extremely tallinhabitants.As the years rolled by, with daily school runs past the Giant’s Grave and theGog Magog Hills, I discovered Wandlebury Hill Fort that lies a few milessoutheast of Cherry Hinton. Now a country park, its history is shrouded inmystery, and I became obsessed with the place and started looking deeply intothe mysteries of the area around the Gog Magogs. Immediately a number ofreferences of giants emerged. One local tradition, relative to the origin of thehills said there, “...was a very large cave, which was inhabited by a giant and his wife (agiantess) of extraordinary stature, whose names were Gog and Magog.” 2 On 27th May 1854, a short item appeared in the Cambridge Chronicle thatdescribed a find by workmen who were preparing the land for the first reservoirfor Cherry Hinton upon Lime Kiln Hill. Nine skeletons were found:“Several of them were of large size, and were evidently the remains of men whoreached to a greater height than ordinary men in the present day.” 3warditches%20graves.tif [../Images/image00293.jpeg] According to local researcher and archaeologist Michelle Bullivant, “thissparked local interest as to a possible race of giants having once lived uponthe hills.”4 Unfortunately this is the only record of that particular discoveryand many more could have been discovered but it gave some clout to the giantlegends that persist around the Gog Magog Hills.These hills are named after Gog and Magog, who, in British mythology were thegiant sons of some of Roman emperor Diocletian’s wicked daughters who werebanished to the island of Albion (an ancient name for England) where they matedwith demons.Like in North America, giants are often linked to mounds, earthworks andhill-forts. Bartlow Mounds are a group of seven mounds remarkably similar tomany in America (most notably Grave Creek Mound in West Virginia and Miamisburgin Ohio). Image: Bartlow Mounds, Cambridgeshire.bartlow-mounds-cambs-UK.bmp [../Images/image00294.jpeg] Heydon Ditch, also in Cambridgeshire, has eerie stories of giant warriors, butwhen it was excavated in the 1950s several taller-than-average skeletons wereunearthed. A similar, although much grander ditch is the Devils Dyke. In Legendsof the Fenland People (1926), Christopher Marlowe describes an old storyassociated with the dyke saying it was constructed by “…a race of giants,renowned alike for cunning, strength and ferocity”.5 Is that what the ancientBritish giants were really like? “The ancient Britons were remarkable for the large stature of their bodies;their eyes were generally blue, which was esteemed a great beauty; and theirhair red or yellow, though in many various gradations. They were remarkablyswift of foot, and excelled in running, swimming, wrestling, climbing, and allkinds of exercises in which either strength or agility were required. Accustomedto hardships and despising cold and hunger, in retreating they plunged into themorasses up to the neck, where they remained several days. They painted theirbodies with a blue dye extracted from woad, and at an early age they weretattooed in a manner the most ingenious and hideous; and in order to exhibitthese frightful ornaments in the eyes of their enemies, they threw off theirclothes in the day of battle. When advancing to the combat their looks werefierce and appalling, and their shouts loud, horrid, and frightful.” 6 If we survey other parts of Britain, legends of giants emerge again and again.Hundreds of ancient megalithic sites have ‘Giant’ in their name. The first knownname of Stonehenge was ‘The Giants’ Dance.’ Stonehenge is a later Saxon name.‘Giant’s Grave,’ ‘Giant’s Hill,’ ‘Giant’s Causeway,’ ‘the Sleeping Giant,’‘Giant’s Well,’ and ‘Giant’s Bed’ are some further examples.The discovery of giant skeletons is clearly more than just an Americanphenomenon, so let’s take a look at some examples of accounts from the BritishIsles, before we head across the Atlantic Ocean.‘The Giants’ Dance,’ now called Stonehenge, is without doubt the most famousarchaeological site in Britain. It is unique in style, as no other stone circleshave lintels and precision-carved stones like this one. The earliest knowndepiction of Stonehenge shows a giant helping Merlin the wizard building thegreat stone circle. It comes from a manuscript called Le Roman de Brut by poetWace dated to around 1150 AD7 (based on History of the Kings of Britain byGeoffrey of Monmouth), but was not published until the early-to-mid 1300s. Inthe illustration it shows Merlin directing a giant human to move a stone lintelinto place. In the text it explains that Merlin is constructing a burial placefor Aurelius Ambrosius, an ancient King. However, History of the Kings ofBritain also states that the monoliths originally came from Africa. “Giants of old did carry them from the farthest ends of Africa, and did set themup in Ireland when they lived there.” 8merlin-stonehenge.bmp [../Images/image00295.jpeg] The original ‘Giants’ Dance’ stone circle was said to have been constructed bygiants at Mount Killarus in Ireland, then Merlin magically transported them overto Salisbury Plain. How this might have been done remains a mystery.There are hundreds of mounds, earthworks, woodhenges and other megaliths spreadout around Salisbury Plain that are part of the greater Stonehenge complex.These are ignored by most visitors to Stonehenge, but some early antiquarianssoon found that something quite remarkable was often hidden within them.In Journey into South Wales (1802) George Lipscomb describes not only a suit ofarmour belonging to a giant warrior at Warwick Castle, but he also states: “…it should be remembered, that Leland, in his “Collectanea”, quotes therespectable authority of his friend, Sir Thomas Eliot, as recording, thathimself had seen, at some place, near Salisbury, a skeleton which measuredfourteen feet ten inches in length.” 9 In the British Critic, Volume 42, pg 544, 1813, the following is reported, “Such were the arms found with a skeleton of large dimensions, in a remarkablebarrow, on the verge of Wiltshire, by the road leading from Salisbury toBlanford.” In A Theological, Biblical, and Ecclesiastical Dictionary (1830), it describes a9 ft 4 in skeleton unearthed near Salisbury in 1719. It also recounts a moundnamed ‘Giant’s Grave’ next to St Edmunds Church. This church was part of theoriginal college founded by the Bishop of Salisbury, Walter de la Wyle in 1269,and is located a few miles from Stonehenge.I now live in the town of Glastonbury in Somerset, less than 80 miles west ofStonehenge. The legendary Isle of Avalon has a few giants hidden within itsrecords too, more often than not linked with the stories of King Arthur. At thecurrent location of Glastonbury Abbey in the 1190s AD, a great oak coffin wasdiscovered by the monks sixteen feet below the surface between two smallpyramids. A controversial object was also found, at only eight feet below thesurface. The infamous lead cross had this carved on it in Latin “Here liesinterred the famous King Arthur on the Isle of Avalon.” This became a sensation,and some say a hoax. However, the skeleton that was excavated was said to beclose to 9 feet tall.9 “It was absolutely gigantic. It appeared to be much taller than an average man,and the space between the eye sockets was as wide as the palm of a man’s hand.”10 king-arthur-cross-abbey-lead.jpg [../Images/image00296.jpeg]Giraldus Cambrensis, a respected historian personally examined the bones and thegrave about four years after the discovery and pronounced it a genuine find. In1278 in the presence of King Edward l and Queen Eleanor, the remains weretransferred to inside the Abbey. Then, in 1962-63, after doing some additionalexcavations at the grave site, Dr. Ralegh Radford, an archaeologist, “confirmedthat a prominent personage had indeed been buried there at the period inquestion.” 11Now I could go on and on and add more accounts from Britain, but that is beyondthe scope of this book.My intense interest in megaliths and prehistoric earthworks led me to America inthe autumn (fall) of 2008. After exploring the incredible stone sites of NewEngland (that Jim writes about in his introduction and chapter 5), the next stopon my trip was Arizona, where I was housesitting for fellow author David HatcherChildress. In his home library one book grabbed my attention and within two daysI had read the whole manuscript. It was A Tradition of Giants by Ross Hamilton.This masterful analysis of the giants in the Ohio Valley inspired me to lookaround Arizona and California for more examples, so after visiting many of thepetroglyph sites of the Southwest, I headed to Hollywood to stay with a friendand her delightful dog called Earl, and decided to investigate the LompockRancho giant account from 1819, that was only a few miles from her house. TheLompock giant, said to be over 12 feet tall was said to have had double rows ofteeth. I hired a car and drove to the area of the so-called ranch, but afterasking some locals for the whereabouts of its location they had no information.I eventually found the exact place where is should be, but it was no longer aranch. It was Vandenburg Airforce Base, and they did not want any giant huntersgoing through their barbed wire gate. We go into much further detail about thisparticular account in the Double Rows of Teeth chapter.I undertook various investigations of reports of giant skeletons, and becameenthralled by the prehistoric Mound Builders, and the mighty landscape artifactsthey left behind. In October 2011 we organised a Megalithomania Conference inGlastonbury, Connecticut. We had Ross Hamilton and his colleague Jeffrey Wilsonspeaking at the event. This is also where I met Jim Vieira. Many discussionstook place and research was shared. Jim’s work on the giants of New Englandpiqued my interest and we stayed in touch thereafter.In late 2012, I went on a road trip with my partner Sheena, starting in NewEngland, heading to Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin. I read hundreds of giant accounts and Jimprovided me with many more to research, as we traveled through the landscape ofthe “Tall Ones.” We visited numerous mound sites that giant skeletons wereexcavated from and learning from Ross and Jeffrey was an eye-opening experience.It integrated me with the incredible sacred landscape of the tribes of old, theearth temples they constructed,and a wisdom tradition that has faded drastically since the arrival of thewhite man.We visited Grave Creek Mound, the Marietta Earthworks, Portsmouth Earthworks,Serpent Mound, Miamisburg, Seip Mound, Newark Earthworks, Chillicothe, StoryMound, Norwood Mound, Aztalan, Mound City, Fort Ancient, numerous other Adena,Hopewell and Fort Ancient culture sites, historical societies and museums, andour last mound stop was McKee’s Mound in Pennsylvania. However we had set anintention to see a giant skeleton with our own eyes, and on the last day of ourtrip we visited the bizarre Mütter Museum in Philadelphia. Numerous scarycarcasses, heads and other organs, as well as elongated skulls from Peru andextreme skeletal deformities were on display, but in the centre of the darkenedroom a magnificent 7 ft 6 inch tall skeleton towered above us.We had met our giant.mutter-museum-giant-skeleton.bmp [../Images/image00297.jpeg] We looked through the records at the museum and discovered that it had been soldto Mütter Museum in 1921, and that the seller from “Northern Kentucky” in thesigned agreement stated that the buyer must never reveal its origins. Could amysterious 7 ft 6 in skeleton found in the giant-occupied region of Americareally be one of the great giants of old?The story of ancient America is not what I had originally thought. Its deepprehistory, high culture, architectural mastery, sacred teachings, andultimately what it has to teach us about our origins is what is now at stake.Today we see giants in various ways: as intellectual giants, philosophicalgiants, or great leaders and sportsmen; but do these compare to the charactersin the story that is about to unfold?Take a look for yourself, as these giants were really here, living where youlive now, and they were as commanding and powerful, and had just as manysupernatural abilities as the folk tales about them. We hope this book opens adoor into this mysterious lost world once ruled by an elite tribal network ofonce great human beings.google-earth-giants-USA.jpg [../Images/image00298.jpeg] "},{"pageContent":"New England Mysteries by Jim VieiraFirst Discovery Everyone loves a mystery, but why is that? Is it because a mystery is more funto dive into than hard science? Or is it that people love a mystery because theyknow intuitively that something is wrong with present theories?It is now time to explore one of the greatest mysteries in human history—amystery that just happened to find me several years ago as I accidently felldown the rabbit hole. I was never able to think the same about the past. Thisstrange story has had many twists and turns and unexpected discoveries for me,but it started over twenty years ago as I strolled through the forest with mybrother and our friends.As stonemasons, my brother and I have always been intrigued by stoneconstructions all around the planet, especially some of the more enigmaticmegalithic sites. Even in our local part of New England, we would marvel at theamazing accomplishments of colonists who laid down over 250,000 miles of stonewalls crisscrossing the landscape. To put it in perspective, this is roughly thedistance to the moon.One day as we walked through the forest in Hawley, Massachusetts a few milesfrom my house, a strange-looking wall caught our attention. This was no ordinarywall—it climbed up a twenty-foot ledge and ended in seven huge multi-ton blockspossessing a serpent’s head as the last stone. My brother and I were puzzled atthe effort to create such a thing and asked why a colonist would bememorializing the form of a serpent.Serpent-Wall-combined.bmp [../Images/image00299.jpeg] I ruminated on this for quite a while and then, serendipitously, a wonderfulbook called Manitou by James Mavor and Byron Dix (1989) came my way.Calendar-2-BW.jpg [../Images/image00300.jpeg]Byron Dix and Dr. Bary Fell at Calendar ll. Coutersy of James A. Garfall. Jim Mavor was a naval architect and professor who designed the submersible subAlvin, featured in National Geographic deep sea documentaries. Byron Dix was anoptical designer and archeoastronomer. Their book describes a multi-yearinvestigative effort that attempts to make the case that Native Americans in theNortheastern United States built with stone for ceremonial and astronomicalpurposes. In fact the oldest currently recorded stone structure in the countrywas built by the Maritime Archaic people in Labrador, which is in the farNortheast. This was a child’s burial mound with a stone cist at L’anse Amour,Newfoundland dated to 7,500 years. The Maritime Archaic people built stonemounds, stone cairns and are most likely responsible for the mysterious standingstones on unpopulated Coffin Island in the far reaches of frigid Labrador.1894-stone-tombs-in-mounds-pic.jpg [../Images/image00301.jpeg]1910-Fowke-stone-vault.jpg [../Images/image00302.jpeg]Ancient Stone Vault within the Kurtz Mound, MissouriAntiquities of Missouri, Gerrard Fowke, 1910.Looking around our country you find native peoples engaging in stoneworkconstruction from coast-to-coast in ancient times. A little known fact is howextensive some of this construction was. Native American civilizations such asthe Adena (1000-200 BC), Hopewell (200 BC-500 AD) and the so-called Fort Ancient(1000-1750 AD) peoples built stone mounds, massive stone wall complexes, stonehilltop forts, stone chambers, and stone tombs all over the eastern half of thecountry. Structures like the 55 feet high stone mound with a 182 feet base thatonce existed in Licking County, Ohio, littered the landscape of ancient America.Most of these were dismantled for colonial use. When this man-made stonemountain was taken down to build a dam, multiple burials were found beneath thestructure. Stone kivas and cliff dwellings found in the Southwest are alsoancient reminders of Native American proficiency in stonework.7brenners-mound-stonework.bmp [../Images/image00303.jpeg] Ancient New England stoneworkin the Historical record As I continued to explore the woods and fields of New England in an attempt tofind evidence of pre-colonial stonework, I decided to turn my attention tohistorical documents to see if the early colonists made any mention ofpre-existing stonework when they arrived. Some notable finds were as follows:John Pynchon, in a letter to John Winthrop Jr. dated Nov. 30, 1654:“Sir I heare a report of a stonewall and strong fort in it, made all of Stone,which is newly discovered at or neere [sic] Pequot, I should be glad to know thetruth of it from your selfe [sic], here being many strange reports about it.” Henry Baker, History of Montville, Connecticut, 1896; pg.31: “Owaneco . . . . afterwards gave them each [two Englishmen who had rescued himfrom drowning] one hundred acres of land, which transaction was afterwardsconfirmed by the General Court, and ordered to be surveyed and laid out about amile or two west northerly of the ancient Indian fence, provided Oweneco hathgood right to said land, and is not prejudicial to any former grant.” Notes to Wawekas Hill, or Mohegan’s Watchtower and Tombstone, c. 1769:“Aged people whose fathers remembered the days of Uncas...uniformly called(Wawekas) Hill by the name of the Indian Watch Tower....The Fort upon this Hillwas a large square building erected in the Indian manner of unpolished stone,without mortar, embanked with earth. The remains of this structure have beenvisible until within a few years. It probably stood in good repair in the daysof Uncas; and though more than one hundred thirty years have passed since thattime, but for the depredations of those who wished to enclose their farms withstone fences, it might have stood firmly at the present day.”Dry-laid stone chambers litter the woods of the Northeast and there is muchcontroversy about who built them. Theories range root cellars from colonialconstruction to ancient Celts and Native Americans having built them. Whoeverbuilt them—and when—has had people debating for over 50 years. Historicaldocuments such as those above would seem to indicate that some of thesestructures may indeed be pre-colonial and most likely Native American.gungywamp-chamber-photo-jim.jpg [../Images/image00304.jpeg]Equinox Stone Chamber, Gungywamp, Connecticut.Believed to be the chamber described by John Pynchon in 1654west-virginia-fayette-x2%20stonemounds.bmp [../Images/image00305.jpeg] A Giant problem in New England What I then found transformed my thinking about ancient America and sent me on aquest to uncover the truth of it. The quest continues to this day. In GeorgeSheldon’s 1895 Town History of Deerfield, Massachusetts, I found a most curiouspassage on page 78: “At the foot of Bars Long Hill, just where the meadow fence crossed the road,and the bars were placed that gave the village its name, many skeletons wereexposed while plowing down a bank, and weapons and implements were found inabundance. One of these skeletons was described to me by Henry Mather who sawit, as being of monstrous size—‘the head as big as a peck basket, with doubleteeth all round.’ The skeleton was examined by Dr. Stephen W. Williams who saidthe owner must have been nearly eight feet high.” I was astonished and told my brother about the account, and he was dumbfounded.Sheldon was a noted historian, a former state Senator of Massachusetts and oneof the first preservationists in the country as well as an amateurarchaeologist. Dr. Stephen West Williams was a well- respected physician inDeerfield who taught anatomy at Berkshire College. I couldn’t wrap my headaround what this account meant—double rows of teeth are something I had neverheard of. Spurred on by this discovery, I then visited local libraries and readthrough thousands of pages of town and county histories of New England. What Iuncovered both amazed and shocked me. Accounts of seven-foot-plus skeletonsunearthed with double rows of teeth were reported in Martha’s Vineyard,Middleboro, Hadley, Newton, and Wellfleet (all in Massachusetts), as well asConcord and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Rockingham, Vermont: The Story of Martha’s Vineyard, Charles Gilbert Hine, 1908, pg.136: “Some 15 years ago the skeleton of an Indian Giant in almost perfectpreservation was dug up in the same locality (Cedar Tree Neck), the bonesindicated a man easily six feet and a half possibly seven feet high. An unusualfeature was a complete double row of teeth on both the upper and lower jaws.” History of the Town of Rockingham, Vermont. 1907, Lyman Simpson Hayes pg. 338: “When the earth was removed from the top of the ledges east of the falls, aremarkable human skeleton, unmistakably that of an Indian, was found. Those whosaw it tell the writer the jaw bone was of such size that a large man couldeasily slip it over his face and the teeth, which were all double, wereperfect.” History of the Town of Middleboro, Mass. Thomas Weston, 1906, pg. 400: “A few years ago when the highway was straightened and repaired, remains werefound. When his skeleton was measured by Dr. Morrill Robinson and others, it wasfound that the thigh bone was four inches longer than that bone in an ordinaryman, and that he had a double row of teeth in each jaw. His height must havebeen at least seven feet and eight inches.” I also found over 100 accounts of seven-foot-plus skeletons reported unearthedin towns across the region, often mentioning strange anatomic anomalies such asjawbones being so large they fit over the face of the finder. After finding theaccount of an 8-foot skeleton from Deerfield with double rows of teeth and askull “as big as a peck basket”, I decided to visit the library that GeorgeSheldon founded—the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association Library and Museum.Sheldon was one of the most respected historians in the country at the time. Hewas the museum’s first president, and maintains legendary status at theprestigious Deerfield Academy to this day. I found correspondence from AdmiralByrd and other luminaries in his personal letters. At the museum’s library, Ishowed one of the employees the giant skeleton account from the Deerfield townhistory, and asked if he could lead me in any direction towards unraveling thismystery.He put in front of me Sheldon’s Archaeological Scrapbook. Sheldon had pastedtogether newspaper accounts about the Mound Builders, the Zuni Indians, andgiant skeletal finds. Accounts of 7- and 8-foot skeletons in Ohio, a nine-footskeleton unearthed in Randolph County, New York, and a 7-foot skeleton withdouble rows of teeth in Hadley, Massachusetts were pasted into his scrapbook. Ithen found the 1883 book of Curiosities and Relics from the library and museumin Deerfield that had a listing of a thigh bone of an “at least” 8-foot skeletonthat was on display until recently. I spoke with a physical anthropologist whofairly recently reinterred the remains as part of Native American GravesProtection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), who verified the information.george-sheldon-scrapbook.jpg [../Images/image00306.jpeg]We investigated the giant skeleton account with double rows of teeth and foundwhat is believed to be the exact location of the burial site as we filmed Searchfor the Lost Giants (History Channel, 2014). A series of meetings with the localfarmers (who have owned the Bars Hill farm area for generations) helped uslocate the site. Although we understandably could not dig at the area because itis a protected Native American burial site, a survey was carried out usingground penetrating radar. The GPR technician scanned a 12 x 4 feet stone slab ofsome sort as well as two large cylindrical artifacts.It is noteworthy that there is very little stone to be found in the Deerfieldarea. He also verified that something had been removed from the depression pitwe surveyed. You can see this in episode 1 of the series and this graphic fromthe show.deerfield-8ft-slab-coffin.bmp [../Images/image00307.jpeg] Armed with these strange accounts and a desire to figure out the implications ofwhat I had found, I decided to go to a conference in Connecticut run by nowco-author Hugh Newman who invited researchers to speak on the mysteries ofancient America. Hugh is an earth mysteries writer and explorer who has traveledthe world studying enigmatic megalithic sites. He had become interested in thestone structures of New England in recent years and had been investigating thesame mystery as I had. What I found was that nearly all the speakers talkedabout encountering similar giant accounts in their research. Ross Hamilton inparticular grabbed my attention as he spoke of working with Native Americansinvestigating this topic. I quickly became friends with Hugh and reached out toRoss who ended up being a mentor to me on the subject.I quickly read Ross Hamilton’s book A Tradition of Giants, which he compiledwith the help of his friend Vine Deloria Jr., a Lakota elder and scholar. Ross’sbook is an extremely well researched and very balanced look at thiscontroversial subject. Ross also uncovered multiple accounts of over seven-footskeletons with double rows of teeth throughout the Ohio Valley. What I decidedwas that I would use Google Books to see how far this story went. Withdigitization of a large body of historical documents and the ability to use keywords, I saved thousands of hours accumulating more reports. I teamed up withwest coast researcher Micah Ewers and together we amassed over 1000 individualaccounts of giant skeletons being unearthed in the past in the United States andover 500 more worldwide.So this is where I stand now, working with Hugh, Ross and Micah trying to figureout this mystery. I have sought the opinion of numerous anthropologists andarchaeologists on this matter. The official position is that these reportsconstitute a collection of hoaxes, misidentified animal remains,disarticulation, measuring (anthropometry) errors, inaccurate regressionformulas, and rare cases of acromegaly and pituitary gigantism. I certainly donot think every report is valid or that all anthropologists and archaeologistsare involved in some wide-sweeping cover-up, but I do believe there is a mysteryhere and a form of obfuscation that keeps the truth hidden. As the reader willfind, our research has revealed that a fair number of these accounts representvery reputable people, real places, and real events. There are reliablemeasurements such as 26, 28 and 29-inch femurs and skulls with circumferences of26, 28, 30, 32, 36 and 40 inches that are well out of the normal range.Many of these reports are from well-known historians noting the actions ofrespected physicians. Anatomic anomalies such as double rows of teeth andjawbones that could be placed over the face are reported from Martha’s Vineyard,Massachusetts to Catalina Island, California and all around the country. Thesereports are often buried obscurely in voluminous town and county histories in anera of inefficient communication. How is it possible that all these respectedpeople through decades of time can be reporting such things without it beingpublic knowledge?I leave it to the reader to decide what to think of all this but predict thatmost rational and logical people will agree with the authors that there is amystery here that requires further investigation.

Early Explorers Acommon theme in the early historical record is settlers encountering giantNative Americans in many parts of the country. As far back as the 1500s when theSpanish navigators were exploring the coast of the Americas, sightings of livegiants were being recorded. Not only does this put the whole phenomenon into anhistorical perspective, it also points to the fact that it was only in the lastfew hundred years that they died off. Three captains of Spanish ships reportedthese taller-than-average native people on their expeditions to America, as wellas Sir Francis Drake, Captain John Smith, a Smithsonian professor, and severalother notable eye-witnesses.2439.png [../Images/image00309.jpeg] Giants Along the Mississippi River, 1519 In 1519, a year before Ferdinand Magellan witnessed the Patagonian giants inSouthern Argentina, Spanish explorer Alonzo Álvarez de Pineda was mapping thecoastline of the Gulf Coast, marking the various rivers, bays, landmarks, andpotential ports, declaring that they belonged to the king of Spain. Afternavigating his way between Florida and Mexico, he sailed back to the mouth ofthe Mississippi River. Pineda was the first Spanish explorer to sail up theMississippi, and reported on large settlements of villages inhabited by localgiants, not far from where the river empties into the Gulf of Mexico. There he“found a large town, and on both sides of its banks, for a distance of sixleagues up its course, some forty native villages.” 1He quickly discovered that these giants were not dangerous, so Pineda and hiscrew settled among them to recuperate and carry out repairs to their four ships.Pineda detailed the abundance of gold found in the river, and how the Indianswore plenty of gold-engraved ornaments. He also noted that other than giants,the tribes also had a race of tiny pygmies. Pineda described the tribes thatsettled near the Mississippi river as: “A race of giants, from ten to elevenpalms in height and a race of pigmies only five or six palms high.”2 (Webster’sDictionary defines a palm used as a unit of measurement to range from seven toten inches, so the giants were at least 6 feet 7 inches to 8 feet tall).Alonso%20Alvarez%20de%20Pineda.bmp [../Images/image00310.jpeg]Alonso Alvarez de PinedaOn his return from Tampico to the Mississippi, Pineda unknowingly sailed rightpast a tribe of equally huge Texas Indians.3 (Matagorda Bay is located about onehundred miles below modern-day Galveston). Historian Woodbury Lowery, along withseveral others, placed “the giant Karankawas” nation around Matagorda Bay atthat time. Furthermore in a report on the Karankawas, John R. Swanton, of theBureau of American Ethnology, describes the men as being: “...very tall and well formed.... Their hair was unusually coarse, and worn solong by many of the men that it reached to the waist. Agriculture was notpractised by these Indians, their food supply being obtained from the waters,the chase, and wild plants, and, to a limited extent, human flesh; for, likemost of the tribes of the Texas coast, they were cannibals.... Head-flatteningand tattooing were practised to a considerable extent.” 4 However it was also recorded that they: “...do not eat men, but roast them only, on account of the cruelties firstenacted against their ancestors by the Spanish.” 5Florida-map-1519-Garay%e2%80%99s%20C%c3%a9dula.bmp [../Images/image00311.jpeg]Pineda’s map of the Florida coastline, 1519 So that’s OK then! Anyway, when Pineda returned, he presented Francisco deGaray, the Spanish governor of Jamaica, with the first maps and sketches of theentire Gulf Coast. These maps also included Pineda’s writings about the race ofgiants living there. These sketches and writings were archived by the famousSpanish chronicler Martín Fernández de Navarrete. They can be found today byvisiting the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Spain.A few years later in 1523, as the Spanish fleet discovered, dominated, andoverran the Caribbean Islands, a strange report came forth via historian PeterMartyr who assisted at the Council of the Indies. The account was originallyshared by a native who was Christianized and taken to Spain: “The report ran that the natives were white and their king and queen giants,whose bones, while babies, had been softened with an ointment of strange herbs,then kneaded and stretched like wax by masters of the art, leaving the poorobjects of their magic half dead, until after repeated manipulations theyfinally attained their great size.” 6 The Patagonian Giants, 1520 Meanwhile, on the most southern tip of South America, giant rumblings wereafoot. Although this account is not one from North America, its place in thehistorical timeline makes this short summary worthy of inclusion. During hisbusy schedule of sailing around the area now known as Patagonia, FerdinandMagellan, much to his surprise, found a naked giant dancing and singing on theshore. Magellan sent one of his men to go on land to make contact and orderedhim to dance and sing to the giant, to show friendship. The look on the chosenman’s face was not recorded, but must have been one of surprise and fear!The frolicking worked and they were able to be alone with the giant. AntonioPigafetta, who kept a diary of the journey, later turned it into a book calledMagellan’s Voyage: A Narrative Account of the First Circumnavigation. He wrote: “When he was before us, he began to marvel and to be afraid, and he raised onefinger upward, believing that we came from heaven. And he was so tall that thetallest of us only came up to his waist.” 7 They spent some time on the island, hunting with the huge natives, building astorehouse for their supplies, and devising a cunning plot to kidnap two of themand take them back to Europe. The first part of the treacherous plan worked, andthey managed to get them on the ship, but they both died before Magellan couldshow off his prized possessions. Why he didn’t keep the bones to prove his claimis unknown, but the decaying bodies, and terrible smell may have been a goodenough reason.Britain soon got involved and in 1578 Sir Francis Drake made contact with thesame Patagonians of the Tehuelche tribe but placed them at 7 feet 6 inches tall,as outlined by his nephew in The World Encompassed (1628): “Magellan was not altogether deceived in naming these giants, for they generallydiffer from the common sort of man both in stature, bigness and strength ofbody, as also in the hideousness of their voices: but they are nothing somonstrous and giant-like as they were represented, there being some English menas tall as the highest we could see, but peradventure the Spaniards did notthink that ever any English man would come hither to reprove them, and thereforemight presume the more boldly to lie.” 8giants-patagonia.jpg [../Images/image00312.jpeg]mod01_gutierrez_patagonia_figures_small.bmp [../Images/image00313.jpeg] In 1580 a Spanish captain, Pedro Sarmiento, was said to have seen giants in thesame area according to an historian on his voyage. Another narrator, AnthonieKnivet, who accompanied the circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish in 1592, wrote oftwo Patagonians twelve feet tall, and a boy whose height was over nine feet.9Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, two Dutch circumnavigators, touched down inPatagonia in 1615 and found some graves made of heaped stones, one of which theyopened and saw within it “the bones of human beings ten and eleven feet instature.” According to Robert Silverberg there were other similar reports likethis.10John Wood, of John Narborough’s 1670 expedition made no reference to their greatstature, only that: “none of the seven Patagonians he met were not much abovesix feet”.11 However, other eyewitness accounts suggest otherwise. Harringtonand Carmen returned there in 1704, with reports that corroborated the Spanishversion. Horace Walpole, the English historian and gothic novelist, published AnAccount of the Giants Lately Discovered: In a Letter to a Friend in the Countryfollowing the return in 1766 of Captain John Byron, who had circumnavigated theworld in the HMS Dolphin. Word leaked out that the crew had seen nine-foot-tallgiants in South America.12 Then in 1741 survivors of a shipwreck, John Cumminsand John Bulkeley, made note that they were “of a middle stature”. Whoever theywere, some of them were very tall, as they wrote the following: “I never was more astonish’d than to see such a set of people, the stoutest ofOur Grenadiers would appear nothing to them....Nothing in Nature could appearmore terribly frightful that these people did both Men and Women. ...theirHorses appear’d so small in Comparison to their Riders, tho’ when I was nearthem I observ’d that their Horses were of the Common Size, and Our People onBoard, who were looking at us thro’ their Glasses, said we look’s like meerDwarfs to the people we were gone amongst....these People who in size come thenearest to Giants of any people I believe in the World’. 13 There is still debate about the authenticity of some of these reports, eventhough there are quite a few of them. Can the chroniclers really be thatconfused that they cannot determine the approximate height of someone standingbefore their very eyes?patagonians-byron-1773.jpg [../Images/image00314.jpeg]Detail from A Representation of the Interview betweenCommodore Byron and the Patagonians. 1773. 14 The White Indians of Duhare, 1521-1526 In early 1521, a secret voyage from Spain was undertaken by Francisco Gordilloand Pedro de Quejo. They sailed over to America and along the Carolina coast tocapture Native American slaves and scout out potential locations for new Spanishcolonies. They managed to capture seventy members of the Chicora tribe to bringback to their homeland. “The chiefs of the province of Chicora, a portion of what is now South Carolina,were famous for their height, which was supposed to prove their royal blood.” 15 While Gordillo and Quejo treated the enigmatic Chicora Indians with treachery,their relationship with the Duhare peoples were much more gentlemanly. This wasprobably because the inhabitants of Duhare were described as looking European,with red or brown hair, tan skin and gray eyes. Strangely, for this part of theworld, the men had full beards and towered over the Spanish. They did not appearto be Native American.One of the kidnapped Chicora Natives was taken back to Spain and christianized.He was named Francisco de Chicora. He learned their language and started workingfor Spanish explorer Lucas Vazquez de Ayllón. They met with the courtchronicler, Peter Martyr, and he talked with him at length about his people,homeland and about neighboring provinces. Ayllón was a member of the RealAudiencia in Santo Domingo (the first court of the Spanish crown in America). DeAyllón had received from Charles V in 1523, a grant for the land explored in1521 by Francisco Gordillo and slave trader Captain Pedro de QuejoSoon after this, he set sail to create a colony in America and eventually landedin this area of the Santee River. He visited with many of the Native Americantribes in the area and recorded their customs, rituals and ways of living. Thereport on the Duhare stated: “Ayllon says the natives are white men, and his testimony is confirmed byFrancisco Chicorana. Their hair is brown and hangs to their heels. They aregoverned by a king of gigantic size, called Datha, whose wife is as large ashimself. They have five children. In place of horses, the king is carried on theshoulders of strong young men, who run with him to the different places hewishes to visit.” 16 Datha was described by the Spanish as being a giant, the largest man they hadever seen. He had a wife as tall as him. He wore brightly colored paint ortattoos on his skin that distinguished him from the commoners. Duhare can eitherbe translated as “di-hAicher - place of the Clan Hare” or, as researcher RichardThornton points out, if the Duhare came from west of the Shannon River inIreland, it meant, “du’hEir – place of the Irish.” Datha was a Medieval IrishGaelic word that means “painted”, that could be linked with the pigments ortattoos that Datha’s skin was covered with (that is a similar style to ancientIrish body art).17 These unusually European characteristics have been noted allacross ancient America, particularly when giants have been reported.One of the things that stood out with this culture was that they bred many typesof livestock including ducks, chickens, geese and even deer. According to theSpanish chroniclers, the Duhare worked large herds of domesticated deer and madecheese from their milk. Although this might sound odd, this technique has beenrecorded in the annals of Irish monks before dairy cows became the norm.18 TheSantee River Natives also grew large amounts of corn and an unrecognized grain,as well as potatoes and other vegetables. However it does raise questions of howthey developed these advanced farming practices. Were there earlier connectionsbetween America and Europe than previously thought?2712.png [../Images/image00315.jpeg] Giants in Tampa Bay, Florida, 1528 In 1528, Pánfilo de Nárvaez and his surviving colleague Álvar Núñez Cabeza deVaca witnessed giants around the area of Tampa Bay, Florida. Three hundred oftheir men went ashore, but only Cabeza de Vaca and a handful of men survived theharsh jungle environment and the consistent onslaught from native attacks. Asthe Spanish invaded, they were outnumbered and outwitted by the locals and panicsoon ensued. Their ships left the ports early in the confusion and only aroundthirty men survived, but Narváez was not among them. Cabeza de Vaca and theremaining Spanish survivors were washed ashore near modern-day Tampa Bay. “All the many Indians from Florida we saw were archers, and, being very tall andnaked, at a distance they appear giants. Those people are wonderfully built,very gaunt and of great strength and agility. Their bows are as thick as an arm,of eleven or twelve spans long, shooting an arrow at 200 paces with unerringaim.” 19 The remaining Spanish quickly formed an expedition to reach a Spanish settlementin Mexico and regroup there, thinking it was only a few miles away. However,after a series of battles with hostile Indians they ended up rafting their wayinto southwestern Texas.20Traveling west along the Colorado River, de Vaca and the survivors of thisdisastrous expedition were the first Europeans to see a bison, and the first totravel from the East Coast to the West Coast of America.Harassment by these robust warriors continued, so Narvaez decided to head southfor the Gulf Coast and escape by the sea. Arriving there after much hardship, heand his men constructed five crude boats in order to search along the coast fora Spanish settlement. Unfortunately, a sudden, fierce storm caught them somedistance from land. The high winds drove all the boats, with all their menaboard far out to sea. All were subsequently lost except Cabeza de Vaca andthree companions who managed to reach the shore. They walked across Texas andNorthern Mexico, finally reaching the Pacific coast where they linked up withFrancisco Vazquez de Coronado in 1541, who had his own tall warrior stories totell.21 De Vaca returned to Spain and published his account, which was abestseller of its time. In it there are references to their encounters withgiants.cabeza-de-Vaca-Portrait-1%20copy.bmp [../Images/image00316.jpeg]Álvar Núñez Cabeza de VacaA few miles south of Tampa Bay, several skeletons were unearthed near LongboatKey that may show that the Spaniards’ eyewitness accounts have some truth tothem. “According to Spanish historians, the Indians encountered in this region werequite tall. Historian Karl Bickel tells of finding two skeletons on neighboringLongboat Key, one seven feet, the other eight feet tall. At least one completeskeleton from Snead Island, with other Indian artifacts, now rests in theSmithsonian Institution.” 22 In 1942, Bickel published the book The Mangrove Coast that gives a history ofthe west coast of Florida, beginning with the chronology of native tribes beforethe Spanish invasion. In 1940, Karl and Madeira Bickel purchased a 10-acre siteoff Bay Shore Drive that included the soon to-be-named Madeira Bickel IndianMound. They donated it to the state to ensure it would be preserved.2516.png [../Images/image00317.jpeg] Coronado’s and Alcaron’s Giant Discoveries, 1540 In 1539, an expedition led by Francisco Coronado was on a quest to discover thelegendary Seven Cities of Cibola, an Aztec city that was said to be fabulouslyrich, with gold and treasures beyond any man’s wildest dreams. Whilst searchingfor what today we call El Dorado, they ran into several tribes of Indian giantsnear Mexico’s present-day border with California and Arizona. The expedition wasdocumented by Pedro de Castaneda who accompanied Coronado and wrote the completeaccount of the adventure. Image: “Coronado sets out to the North”. Oil paintingby Frederic Remington.Coronado-RemingtonBW.jpg [../Images/image00318.jpeg]Their journey began in Mexico City, heading west towards the Pacific coastlinewith around three-hundred Spaniards and eight-hundred Indians. As theyapproached the coast, they redirected north and travelled through the areas nowcalled Sonora and Sinaloa. Meanwhile, Coronado’s associate Hernando de Alarconset sail along the coast so they could align with the expedition members whowere on foot. Coronado then sent out one of his team to rendezvous with theship: “Don Rodrigo Maldonado, who was captain of those who went in search of theships, did not find them, but he brought back with him an Indian so large andtall that the best man in the army reached only to his chest. It was said thatother Indians were even taller on the coast.” 23 This particular giant was later revealed to be part of the Seri tribe,inhabitants of Tiburon Island.Hemando%20de%20Alarcon.jpg [../Images/image00319.jpeg]Hernando de AlarconSalina, Kansas burial pit postcard.Salina%20Kansas%20burial%20pit%20postcard.jpg [../Images/image00320.jpeg] Soon after this, whilst trying to establish contact with Alarcon, CaptainMelchior Diaz took a group of men and guides out toward the north and west insearch of the sea coast and the ships: “After going about 150 leagues, they came to a province of exceedingly tall andstrong men—like giants.” 24 These were later found out to be a Yuman tribe called the Cocopa, who were hugeand went about mostly naked: “When they carry anything, they can take a load of more than three or fourhundredweight on their heads. Once when our men wished to fetch a log for thefire, and six men were unable to carry it, one of these Indians is reported tohave come and raised it in his arms, put it on his head alone, and carried itvery easily.” 25By the time they reached the coast, where the Indians said they had seen theships, they were already on their way back to Mexico. However, Alcaron, thecaptain, changed his mind and headed back north and soon came unexpectedly uponthe San Gabriel, loaded with provisions for Coronado.Adding a third ship to the mission, and after nearly losing all three ships inthe murky shallow waters, they made it to the mouth of the Colorado River, thefirst westerners to explore this area. They dropped anchor and took two smallerboats to fight against the powerful current. They then headed into unchartedterritory: “...thus began the historic first voyage by Europeans up the Colorado Riveramong the tall Yuman peoples who lived along its banks on either side.” 26 Alarcon and his men soon came upon about two hundred and fifty tall Cocopawarriors standing on the banks, ready to attack them. But the captain, by makinghand signals of peace and offering gifts, won them over. Further upstream,thousands of giant Indians were witnessed with bows and arrows that he describedas: “large and well formed, without being corpulent. Some have their noses pierced,and from them hang pendants, while others wear shells... All of them, big andlittle, wear a multi-colored sash about the waist; and tied in the middle, around bundle of feathers hanging down like a tail.... Their bodies are brandedby fire; their hair is banged in front, but in the back it hangs to the waist.”27Alarcon and his men made it as far as the southern edge of the Grand Canyon. Heis almost unique among the conquistadores in that he treated the Indians he methumanely, unlike many of his colleagues: “The Indians had an experience they were never to repeat: they were sorry to seethese white men leave.” 286840.png [../Images/image00321.jpeg] De Soto’s Encounters with Giants, 1540-41 Whilst the survivors of Narvaez’s crew were making their way across the country,and Alcaron was making friends with giants, another Spanish explorer, HernandoDe Soto, sailed nine ships into Tampa Bay that ignited one of the mostfascinating stories between the Native Americans and the Spanish.7741_de-Soto-Hernando.bmp [../Images/image00322.jpeg]Hernando De Soto In the early spring of 1541 De Soto’s army travelled from Florida to MiddleGeorgia. Some of the officers immediately noted that the peoples in that regionwere more advanced culturally than other Indians they had encountered, and weremostly around one foot taller than the Spanish (5 ft 4 was the Spanish averageat the time). These were the Okonee and Tamatli tribes of the Muskogean Culture,who in turn were ancestors of the Creek Indians. The Spanish named them ‘LosIndios Gigantes’ (The Giant Indians). De Soto’s chroniclers wrote that some‘Great Suns’ (Chief Priests) of these provinces were seven feet tall. Their vastterritory extended from Tampa Bay north to the present Jacksonville area andwest to the Aucilla River, which runs along the eastern border of modernJefferson County and empties into the gulf.29For protection the Conquistadors took these chiefs hostage and called them‘guests.’ De Soto also required the natives to furnish him with porters. TheIndians’ reaction to this policy varied. After some reluctance, the cacique ofOcala, “an Indian of enormous size and amazing strength,”30 finally agreed tobecome De Soto’s ‘guest’. Vitacucho, the cacique in the neighboring province ofCaliquin (present-day Alachua County), consented only after his daughter fellinto De Soto’s hands. But even while being detained, Vitacucho and his tallwarriors secretly managed two uprisings. Copafi, the cacique of the Apalacheearound Tallahassee, described as “a man of monstrous proportions,”31 refusedeven to meet with De Soto, but a party led by the governor himself finallycaptured the giant and brought him in without much trouble because thay hadkidnapped his daughter.Hernando De Soto’s meetings with giants continued as he pushed further inland.After a winter break at Ambaica Apalachee, he moved through the country withmore than six hundred men and two hundred horses, traveling through northernFlorida, southern Georgia, and western Alabama, meeting many tribes along theway.DeSoto_Map_HRoe_2008.jpg [../Images/image00323.jpeg] Rodrigo Ranjel, De Soto’s private secretary wrote a diary detailing theexpedition. The territory they were exploring was ruled by the giant NativeAmerican chief Tuscaloosa and upon the conquistadors’ arrival, the chief’seighteen year-old son fiercely approached De Soto’s cavalry. Ranjel writes:“Seeing him we paused, dumb with amazement. For, though but a youth...he toweredon high. A great-limbed giant: heads of tallest men reached only to his breast.” After a three-day march De Soto and fifteen soldiers entered Tuscaloosa’svillage and discovered that the chief was even more enormous than his son andturned out to be the tallest and most handsomely shaped Indian they saw duringall their travels. His physical measurements, writes Garcilaso de la Vega, whoaccompanied De Soto: “...were like those of his son, for both were more than a half-yard taller thanall the others. He appeared to be a giant, or rather was one, and his limbs andface were in proportion to the height of his body. His countenance was handsome,and he wore a look of severity, yet a look which well revealed his ferocity andgrandeur of spirit. His shoulders conformed to his height, and his waistlinemeasured just a little more than two-thirds of a yard [wide]. His arms and legswere straight and well formed and were in proper proportion to the rest of hisbody. In sum he was the tallest and most handsomely shaped Indian that theCastilians saw during all their travels.” 32 Image: Artists impression of the rather tall Tuscaloosa, with De Soto.Tuscaloosa-desoto.jpg [../Images/image00324.jpeg] After a few days of watching colorful war dances, and Tuscaloosa completelyignoring the Spanish visitors, De Soto took the chief by the hand, and theywalked together with him to the piazza. There they sat on a bench and talked forseveral minutes. Tuscaloosa was persuaded to join De Soto on their quest towardsMobile. However, owing to the cacique’s huge size and immense weight, no horsewas able to bear him. They eventually found a packhorse accustomed to heavyloads that was strong enough to carry the chief. But when he mounted the horse,Tuscaloosa’s feet almost touched the ground. This description accords withGarcilaso de la Vega’s statement that the chief stood half-a-yard taller (1.5ft) than the tallest Spaniard. Though no one recorded Tuscaloosa’s actualheight, these two descriptions suggest he was between 7 and 8 feet tall.Whilst trekking towards Mobile, two of De Soto’s soldiers disappeared and thescouts returned to warn De Soto. Meanwhile, a rebellion was forming, andhundreds of Indian warriors hid within the town in anticipation. De Soto stoodstrong, and approached the town and its high walls. A welcoming committee ofpainted warriors, clad in robes made of animal skins and headpieces withvibrantly colored feathers, came out to greet them. Some young Native Americanmaidens followed, dancing and singing. De Soto entered the town with a few ofhis most trusted soldiers, along with Tuscaloosa and the chief ’s entourage. TheSpaniards stood in a piazza, surrounded by a stream of foreign colors andfluttering sounds, but noticed around eighty houses within the village. Severalof them were described as large enough to hold at least one thousand people.Unknown to De Soto, more than two thousand Native American warriors hid behindthe walls. After some of the chiefs from the town joined him, Tuscaloosawithdrew from De Soto. With a severe look, he warned the governor and hissoldiers to leave immediately. De Soto tried to regain custody of the chief, buta tussle between a Spaniard and an Indian chief ignited an all-out battle. Undera barrage of arrows, De Soto and his men retreated from the village. Theyregrouped, and made a plan of attack. When they gained entry to the village,they killed the chief’s giant son, set fire to the buildings, and massacredaround 2,500 of the city’s inhabitants. Only 18 Spanish soldiers fell.Despite the death of his son and the overall carnage left in the wake of thebattle, Tuscaloosa escaped. Riding deep into unknown lands, De Soto and his menmarched to capture him, but the great chief disappeared with twenty bodyguards,and the pursuing Spaniards found only abandoned cities with massive mounds.During the mid-20th century, archaeologists found numerous large skeletonsranging between 7 and 14 ft in height in royal burials at Ocmulgee NationalMonument and Etowah Mounds National Historic Landmark (see pages 220 and 244).Both these town sites were ancestral to the Creek Indians, so the stories of theSpanish are quite plausible. Creek men today, especially in northern Alabama andGeorgia, tend to be exceptionally tall.2573.png [../Images/image00325.jpeg] Francis Drake and the California Giants, 1579 Elizabethan Naval Commander, Sir Francis Drake landed on the coast of Virginia,near the mouth of the James River in 1577 as part of his famous circumnavigationof the globe (1577-1580). He named the region Virginia in honor of QueenElizabeth I, then explored the Chesapeake Bay for a few weeks. He then led apart of his fleet’s crewmen on horseback and foot along the James River for 10days until they reached the summit of a mountain, where they could see a vastvalley covered in grasslands and fields. Drake’s memoir states that this valleywas densely populated by agricultural Indians, who were peaceful and culturallyadvanced.drake-portrait-1628.jpg [../Images/image00326.jpeg]Portrait of Sir Francis Drake.Frontspiece to his nephew’sThe World Encompassed (1628) He was part of the team involved in the discovery of the coast of UpperCalifornia, which was named New Albion. After experiencing the Patagonian Giantsa year earlier, and spotting a few more on his famous voyage, Drake sailednorthwards along the West Coast of the Americas. After moving up and down theNorth American coastline, he ended up in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay,where he remained for over a month (June-July, 1579). Here he worked on his shipand made contact with the Indians who were fascinated by the strange white menwho had arrived in their territory.Image: Drake receiving the Crown from the Hioh, or King of New Albion. FromDavid Henry’s, An Historical Account of All the Voyages Round the World (CotsenCollection).drake-headdress-in-new%20albion.jpg [../Images/image00327.jpeg] Francis Fletcher, Drake’s chronicler of the voyage, says the local chief was “aman of large body and good aspect,” and even placed his own crown, a headdressof feathers on Drake’s head and encouraged him to exercise dominion over theirland. He also describes these Indians as a tall people with herculean strength: “Yet are the men commonly so strong of body, that that which two or three of ourmen could hardly bear, one of them would take upon his back, and withoutgrudging carry it easily away, up hill and down hill an English mile together.”334434.png [../Images/image00328.jpeg] Santa Catalina Island, California, 1602 Although Santa Catalina Island had been visited by Don Juan Cabrillo in 1542, nodetailed accounts of the inhabitants were given, apart from that the island “hada large and vigorous population.”34 It was 58 years later that Spanish explorerSebastian Vizcaino, the man who gave the island the name Santa Catalina, visitedthe island with chronicler, Father Torquemada. On the second day of theirstopover the Spaniards found “a level prairie, very well cleared, where theIndians were assembled to worship an idol which was there.” Torquemada describesthe center of the temple as being “formed by a large circle of long stonespointing upward toward the mid-day sun,” in the center of which was the idolthat “resembled a demon, having two horns, no head, a dog at its feet and manychildren painted all around it.”35 This megalithic complex was described asbeing two miles wide, and was part of a major ceremonial area to worship theTongva deity Chinigchinich; a kind of ‘sun-god.’Catalina could have been the ceremonial centre of this ancient tradition, that,as we’ll see later, could have gone back as far as 8,300 BC (See Further Afieldchapter). Tantalisingly, the only graphic representation of the site was asimple circle drawn by him on a map, but this map is no longer in existence. Noris the temple, as it disappeared in the ensuing decades thanks to the Spanishchristians: “The early mission fathers sent an expedition to the island todestroy a so-called temple in which the natives worshipped.”36 A briefdescription of the islanders was given, although no mention of ‘giants’ wasforthcoming: “Torquemada considered the natives of Santa Catalina a superior race and inadvance of the natives of the mainland in every way. The women were attractive,had fine eyes, and were modest and decorous, while the children were describedas ‘white and ruddy.’” 37 Over 3,000 skeletons were unearthed by Ralph Glidden on the Channel Islands inthe 1930s including some that were of very large proportions.3401.png [../Images/image00329.jpeg] John Smith and the Virginia Giants, 1606The History of Virginia, The Southern Literary MessengerVol 5, 1839, pg. 789 The following account is about the famous Captain John Smith’s encounter withimmense natives in the early 1600s. From the article:“Captain Smith’s General Historic. Vol. 1, p. 120 gives an account of aprodigious giant tribe of Indians, the Susquesahanocks, whom he met at the headof the Chesapeake Bay. This relation has been rejected as incredible. Monumentalevidences have, however, within the last age, come to light, which would seem toconfirm the existence of such a race of giants. Human bones of extraordinarysize, thigh bones three feet in length, and skeletons seven feet in length havebeen discovered on Flint Run in the county of Shenandoah, on Hawksbill creek,Tuscarora creek and on the South Branch of the Potomac.” The finds continued in the general area for the next 100 years after theseaccounts, including the unearthing of 7 to 8 ft tall skeletons which were at onetime on display at the Maryland Academy of Sciences, with skulls of “unusualsize” and thigh bones “as thick as those of a horse.”38 The following account isfrom Smith’s diaries: “They measured the calf of the largest man‘s leg, and found it three quarters ofa yard about, and all the rest of his limbs were in proportion; so that heseemed the stateliest and most goodly personage, they had ever beheld. Hisarrows were five quarters long [sic], headed with the splinters of a whiteChrystal-like stone…” Also from Smith, “Those are the most strange people of allthose Countries, both in language and attire; for their language it may wellbeseeme their proportions, sounding from them, as it were a great voice in avault, or cave, as an Echo.” 39 The NASA website says the following about Smith’s Map of 1612. ”Considering the crude navigational tools he had at his disposal, Captain JohnSmith’s map of Virginia was amazingly accurate.”40 The Susquehannock on the map is the one Smith described above. Note thedescription: “The Susquesahanocks are a gyant people & thus atired.”The following is an abstract from Dr. Marshall Becker’s paper. Becker is asenior fellow of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania: “When John Smith first contacted a group of Susquehannock in 1608, he describedthese people as “gyant-like.” Direct confirmation of this observation can now beprovided through studies of the long bones of a population which was part of theSusquehannock “confederacy.” Recent excavations at a Susquehannock site on theSouth Branch of the Potomac River in Hampshire County, West Virginia, revealedportions of a palisaded village and associated features dating from the middleof the 16th century. This remnant of a flood-destroyed site yielded 13relatively intact burials. Surface collection of skeletal material immediatelydownstream of the site after the flood, provided long bones from at least 18other adults. Calculation of the stature of the individuals represented in thissample and comparisons with the other Native American populations of this periodconfirm John Smith’s observations.”41 Image: John Smith’s 1606 map showing a Susquehannock Male (upper right). The mapwas created by cartographer William Hole.1624-john-smith-virginia-map-bw.jpg [../Images/image00330.jpeg] There is no shortage of sources confirming Smith’s claims, such as the work ofnoted archaeologist Donald A. Cadzow. Cadzow’s involvement in 1932 at theWashington County, Pennsylvania find, included 48 very large skeletons, one ofthem being seven feet, five inches tall. A 1932 newspaper article42 announcedthe intention to find a fort of the giant Susquehannocks. That prediction wouldbe borne out in September of that year, with the unearthing of theaforementioned giant skeletons. In the Baltimore Sun, July 13th 1930, is foundan report describing Cadzow’s work at Safe Harbor, Pennsylvania. titled, ScienceUncovers Evidence To Support Captain John Smith’s Yarns.An article from the Syracuse-Herald Journal, July 6, 1954 described tall NativeAmericans of the past in the Spanish Hill area: “Historians describe them as giants and this has been borne out by the fact thatskeletons seven and eight feet tall have been exhumed.” 1624-close-up-map-giant%20copy.jpg [../Images/image00331.jpeg]Another report buried in a document from 1852, described in a non-sensationalaccount that further authenticated John Smith’s claims: “Human bones of extraordinary size- thigh bones three feet in length andskeletons seven feet in length have been discovered on Flint run in this county,on Hawksbill creek, Tuscarora creek and in Hardy county.” 433114.png [../Images/image00332.jpeg] Killed by a Giant IndianBiography and history of the Indians of North America,By Samuel Gardner Drake, 1834 This fatal, yet amusing anecdote, tells the story of a ‘giant-like’ Indiankilling an Englishman, with a friend who got warned not to retaliate: “One William Hammond being killed ‘by a giant-like Indian’ near New York, about1637, Capt. Gardener told Waiandance that he must kill that Indian; but thisbeing against the advice of the great Sachem, his brother, he declined it, andtold the captain that that Indian was a mighty great man, and no man daredmeddle with him, and that he had many friends.”John Lawson meets the Giants, 1701Lawson1709.bmp [../Images/image00333.jpeg] Englishman John Lawson explored 500 miles of the Carolinas in the early 1700s,and was the first to note that less than one in six Indians had survived theongoing smallpox epidemic that lasted from 1650 to 1700.44 The early Spanishexplorers had spread numerous old-world diseases that decimated large swathes ofIndians. Entire villages were decimated “without leaving one Indian alive.”However, on his travels he did witness some larger than life natives in his bookA New Voyage to Carolina: “He was the tallest Indian I ever saw, being about seven-foot high, and a verystrait compleat person, esteem’d on by the King for his great art in hunting.”45 “The Indians of North-Carolina are well shap’d clean-made people, of diferentstatures, as the Europeans are, yet chiefly inclin’d to be tall.” 46 3117.png [../Images/image00334.jpeg] The Colorado River Yumans in 1775With Anza to California, 1775-1776: The Journal of Pedro Font This description of tall Indians comes from the journals of Pedro Font. JuanBautista de Anza was a Spanish military leader who left Horcasitas (nearpresent-day Hermosillo in Sonora) for Monterey, California in September 1775with crew of 240 men. Their goal was to secure an overland route from theinterior of Sonora, bring settlers, and affirm the Crown’s claim to this outpostof empire at a time when England and Russia appeared to challenge it. Pedro Fontwas a dour, judgmental Catalonian priest loyal to the Church, unlike his captainwho was a natural leader. However, Font’s words caught our attention whenresearching this chapter: “These Yumas, and likewise the Cajuenches and the rest, are well formed, tall,robust, not very ugly, and have good bodies.

They were first witnessed by French explorers around 1673. TheOsage Indians were a seminomadic tribe and were known for gardening, hunting,and foraging. Warriors were very hardy and could travel 60 miles a day on foot.Eventually, they found themselves in the northwestern part of Arkansas.Regarding the Osage physicality is this passage from the diaries of Lewis andClark: “The Osage Nation of Indians live about two hundred miles up this (Osage) river.They are of a large size and well proportioned, and a very warlike people.” 47 The early American writer Washington Irving said of the Osage: “...the finest looking Indians I have ever seen.” 48 In R. B. Marcy’s Exploration of the Red River of Louisiana in the Year 1852,W.D.C. Armstrong enjoins similarly: “Father Charlevoix in his Historical Journal of a Voyage Down the Mississippisays ‘The Akansas are reckoned to be the tallest and best shaped of all thesavages of this continent, and they are called, by way of distinction, the finemen.’” 49 From An Account of Louisiana: Being an Abstract of Documents in the Offices ofthe Department of State and of the Treasury, published in 1803, it reads: “On the Missouri and its waters are many and numerous nations, the best known ofwhich are the Osages, situated on the river of the same name on the right bankof the Missouri at about eight leagues from its confluence with it; they consistof one thousand warriors, who live in two settlements at no great distance fromeach other. They are of gigantic stature and well proportioned, are enemies ofthe whites and of all other Indian nations and commit depredations from theIllinois to the Arkansas. The trade of this nation is said to be under anexclusive grant. They are a cruel and ferocious race, and are hated and fearedby all.”According to Catlin in his book, Letters and Notes (1841), the Osages were thetallest men in North America: “Very few of the men, at their full growth...are less than six feet in stature,and very many of them six and a half, and others seven feet. They are at thesame time well-proportioned in their limbs and good-looking.” 50osage-chief-BW.bmp [../Images/image00336.jpeg] Image: George Catlin’s painting of Osage leader Tehong-tas-sab-bee, 1841.Courtesy of the Caitlin Collection. Further reports of ‘living giants’ continued in other parts of the country. InOnondaga County, New York, however, there was one dead one too—killed by agun-shot in 1849: “On the late Dr. Western’s farm could be distinctly traced the remains of asmall fortification, with a burying place. One grave was opened, in which werethe remains of thirteen men. One of the skulls taken from it had been perforatedby a bullet, which was found within it. Another skull found within this gravewas very much larger than its fellows; the under jaw would fit completelyoutside of a common man’s, and it is said that the other bones were ofcorresponding gigantic dimensions.” 51 This one comes from Hardesty’s History of Monroe County, Ohio (1882): “He further told me of the killing of a big Indian at Buckchitawa, about thetime of the settlement at Marietta [Ohio]. The Indians had a white prisoner whomthey forced to decoy boats to the shore. A small boat was descending the rivercontaining white people, when this prisoner was placed under the bank to tellthose in the boat that he had escaped captivity, and to come to the shore andtake him in. The Indians were concealed, but the big Indian stuck his head outfrom behind a large tree, when it was pierced by a bullet from the gun of thesteersman of the boat. The Indians cried out Wetzel, Wetzel, and fled. This wasthe last ever seen of the prisoner. The Indians returned next day and buried thebig Indian, who, he said, was twenty inches taller than he was, and he was atall man. When Chester Bishop was digging a cellar for Asahel Booth, atClarington, many years ago, he came across a skeleton, the bones of which wereremoved carefully by Dr. Richard Kirkpatrick, and from his measurement theheight of the man when living would have been 8 feet and 5 inches. It isprobable that these were the bones of the big Indian of whom the Indian atJackson’s told me.” This strange account comes from A History of Pioneer Families of Missouri, byWilliam Smith Bryan, 1876, pg.101: “It is not known for certain whether any of the Indians were killed in thisbattle or not but one of their chiefs, named Keokuk, a man of some distinction,was wounded and died shortly after. He was buried in the prairie, one andone-half miles northeast of the present town of Wellsville, in Montgomery County[Missouri]. In 1826 his remains were taken up by Dr. Bryan and several othergentlemen and upon his breast was found a large silver medal, containing hisname, rank, etc. He was evidently a giant in stature, for the jaw bone, which,with several other bones of the body, are still preserved by Mrs. Dr. Peery, ofMontgomery county, will fit over the face of the largest sized man.” Not only does it appear that a spiritual and warrior class of giants existedamong Native Americans, but substantial evidence points to wars and conflictsthousands of years ago between the local tribes and a separate race of giants(See Legends of the Tall Ones chapter).Finally, this is an account from an old settler about two miles from RossHamilton’s house, in Madisonville, Ohio: “Another incident of a later date took place east of Madison, when the victimwas an Indian. West of Madison was a station known as Nelson’s, where werehorses pasturing. A party of Indians on their way toward the hills rode off withsome of these, one of which was hoppled. Nelson and others of the fort madepursuit, but failed in overtaking any except the one on the hoppled horse, whomNelson shot when near the site of the present residence of Esquire Clason. Therethe Indian was buried, and the circumstance turned to account by naming theplace Indian hill. Esquire Clason says that many years afterward the grave wasdiscovered by accident and the jawbone secured as a relic in his family. Judgingfrom the relic, he says, the Indian must have been a giant in proportions.” 52 6845.png [../Images/image00337.jpeg] Remarkable Race of Polar GiantsThe Virginia Enterprise, September 29, 1899The Antarctic Circle and Patagonia For the most recent evidence of ‘living giants’ that were actuallyphotographed, we return to Patagonia and further south towards the Antarctic,with some remarkable pre-photoshop era pictures of explorer Dr. Frederick A.Cook standing between two rather large individuals. He spent two years assurgeon and photographer for the Belgian Antartic Expedition of 1897-99 (seemap). This is just one of a number of photographs that were taken of the OnaIndians, who were possible relations of the Fuegians and Patagonians.patagonian-giants-cook-cut.bmp [../Images/image00338.jpeg] Dr. Cook is known to be 5 feet 9 inches tall,53 so these taller than averageNatives’ heights can easily be estimated. On the left we have 6 ft 10 inches,and on the right we have 7 ft exactly. These two men are 19% and 20% taller thanCook. Micah Ewers did further analysis and deduced that Cook is 304 pixels, thegiants 360 to 365 pixels or so. If we make Cook 5 ft 10 in his shoes, theybecome 6 ft 11 and 7 ft 1 respectively.Cook also photographed a powerful 6 ft 6 Ona woman, as well as a 7 ft 2 nakedmale, that were published in 1938 in Popular Photography Magazine.54 In themagazine he made it clear that some stood up to 7 feet 6 inches tall.Cook-antartic-expedition-map.jpg [../Images/image00339.jpeg]6848.png [../Images/image00340.jpeg] WILD SERI CANNIBALSThe Pittsburg Press, July 23, 1900Tiburon Island, Gulf of California, Mexico The sub-heading reads: “Who Do Not Stop Growing Until Over Forty Years ofAge.....Giants in Stature and Wonderful Runners.” Tiburon Island was the lastoutpost of what the press at the time called ‘savages’. In true warrior style,the Indians vehemently held their ground until the turn of last century, withwitnesses describing them as extremely tall. Notably, the Smithsonian gotinvolved: “One of the most remarkable things about the Seri, said Prof W.J. McGee of theBureau of Ethnology, to a Washington Post reporter, is that they seem to keep ongrowing all their lives. Whether this be in truth the case or not. I am surethat they continue to increase in stature until they are 40 years of age -certainly a very extraordinary phenomenon from a physiological point of view.”pittsburg-press-july23-1900-seri-cannibals.tiff [../Images/image00341.jpeg] The article continues with accolations of their physical prowess, huntingskills, and ferocious nature, although they were described as slim of body,extremely agile, muscular, with very large hands and feet. How much longer theylasted in this primitive state is unknown, but W. J. McGee was making plans forthem four years later. Not only was he involved in the purchase of the famousSan Diego giant (see page 223), he wanted to exhibit some of the Seri Indians atthe St. Louis World’s Fair that opened in April 1904. He managed to persuadevarious other Native American tribal members to join in, including some (notparticularly tall) Tehuelche Patagonians, but was unable to get the mighty Serito attend. He basically attempted to represent “family groups of pygmies andgiants, showing the largest and smallest members of the human family.” 55 Whatis interesting though, is the fact that a Smithsonian anthropologist (who hadrecently resigned from the Bureau of Ethnology) was involved in showcasingliving giants to the general public.We hope this selection of reports over a 400-year period puts some perspectiveon this enduring mystery. Notable captains, military officers, Smithsonianethnologists, and other high-ranking officials, have all reported seeing livinggiants with their own eyes. Even some early American presidents now have to beadded to the list, as we’ll see in the next chapter.Patagonian%20and%20Fuegan%201871%20Wood%20engraving.bmp[../Images/image00342.jpeg]Wood engraving of Patagonian andvery tall Fuegian 1871. "},{"pageContent":"2.Presidents and Giants George Washington and Giant Bones, 1754-55 In Winchester, the most northerly town in Virginia, old legends talk aboutghostly 7-foot-tall Indian warriors roaming the streets, most notably PiccadillyStreet, that have even been witnessed in recent times and recorded by author MacRutherford. Jim spoke with the author to verify the following account from hisbook Historic Haunts of Winchester (2007), that discusses local giant lore andthe relationship to President George Washington’s discovery of very tallskeletons during the French and Indian War (1754–1763): “The legend began hundreds of years ago. The first written report of such largeIndians dates back to 1707, when Swiss explorer Louis Michelle visited theShenandoah Valley. Local Indians who lived or hunted in the Winchester area,showed Michelle huge stones, thought to be sacrificial altars. He was also shownburial mounds of ancient warriors known to have been over seven feet tall.Michelle’s diaries and maps relating to his adventures in the Shenandoah Valleyare currently stored in the Royal Archives in London.During the French and Indian war, the tale of giant Indians was kept very muchalive. Colonel George Washington, while in command of the militia force inWinchester, directed the building of Fort Loudoun to protect local citizens fromattack. While digging the Fort’s foundation, a squad of Washington’s militiamendiscovered Indian skeletons, Washington reported that they were seven feetlong.”George_Washington_in_1772_at_age_40.jpg [../Images/image00343.jpeg] In 1754, Washington subsequently received title to 23,200 acres near where theKanawha River flows into the Ohio River, in what is now western West Virginia.He also frequently bought additional land in his own name. By 1775, Washingtonhad doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6,500 acres, and had increased its slavepopulation to over 100. Part of Fort Loudon remains today in Downtown Winchesterand is open to the public as a museum. The giant bones are not there.2471.png [../Images/image00344.jpeg] Abraham Lincoln and the Niagara Giants 1848 Congressman Abraham Lincoln visited Niagara Falls in 1848 en route from Bostonto Chicago and delivered a speech while he was visiting the area. Some strangecomments came forth, hinting he knew about the ancient giants: “When Columbus first sought this continent---when Christ suffered on thecross---when Moses led Israel through the Red-Sea---nay, even, when Adam firstcame from the hand of his Maker---then as now, Niagara was roaring here. Theeyes of that species of extinct giants, whose bones fill the mounds of America,have gazed on Niagara, as ours do now. Contemporary with the whole race of men,and older than the first man, Niagara is strong, and fresh to-day as tenthousand years ago.”1abraham-lincoln-aged37.bmp [../Images/image00345.jpeg]2474.png [../Images/image00346.jpeg] Thomas Jefferson and the Osage Indians, 1804 In 1804 Thomas Jefferson met with Osage tribal leaders in Washington D.C. todiscuss issues of land and trade. Jefferson was very impressed with the physicalprowess of the Osage. Jefferson called their warriors “gigantic” – averagingwell over 6 feet in height (One Osage chief was 7 feet tall and weighed 300pounds). The following was described by Mrs. Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844)who was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson and chronicler of early life inWashington, D.C.: “Tall, erect, finely proportioned and majestic in their appearance, dignified,graceful and lofty in their demeanor, they seem to be nature‘s own nobility.” Had these people not been seen by the early French, the Jeffersonian Society,and others including the frontier painter George Catlin, we might today have noauthentic record of their venerable lineage (see previous chapter).Some believed them to be related to the old Cherokee gentry originating ofTennessee, who also tended to be tall, strong, and heavy. But the story of theirorigins reaches yet deeper into prehistory, as their tribal legend relates howthey originated, in very ancient times, out of the Ohio Valley.jeffeson-trumbull_portrait%5b1%5d.bmp [../Images/image00347.jpeg]1788 miniature portrait of Jefferson by John Trumbull, aged 33Silver_peace_medal%2c_1801%2c_issued_under_President_Thomas_Jefferson_and_given_to_an_Osage_chieftain_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC06195.bmp[../Images/image00348.jpeg]Silver peace medal given to an Osagechieftain by Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson was said to have opened an Indian burial mound on his estate,Monticello, in Virginia (no giants were reported). He also had an abidinginterest in the ancient mound building civilizations. The following informationfrom Professor J. Houston McCulloch shows Jefferson’s interest in a very strangeearthwork complex in Ohio called the Hanukkah Mound (Hanukkah is a Jewishfestival): “In an important new book entitled Jefferson and the Indians: The Tragic Fate ofthe First Americans, Anthony F.C. Wallace, University Professor of Anthropology,Emeritus, at the University of Pennsylvania, notes that in 1803, PresidentThomas Jefferson was impressed by William Lytle’s early maps of the East Forkand Milford Works, and requested more information about ‘Those works ofAntiquity.”’ 2 Jefferson’s Presidential interest in these specific earthworks may explain whythe Corps of Engineers would have taken the trouble in 1823 to map structuresthat had no conceivable contemporary military value. The fact that the 1823 mapdepicts precisely those earthworks surveyed by Lytle in 1803 strongly indicatesthat there was a more than coincidental link between the two surveys. There hasbeen much speculation that the Lost Tribes of Israel made it to ancient Americaand blended with the Native peoples of the time. The controversial Newark HolyStones, the Bat Creek Stone and the Hanukkah mound have all been pointed to asindications that this may have been a reality. The fact that Jefferson went wellout of his way to have this site surveyed only adds to the mystery.

Legends of the Tall Ones “The Iroquois, the Osage, the Tuscaroras, the Hurons, the Omahas, and many otherNorth American Indians all speak of giant men who once lived and roamed in theterritories of their forefathers. All over what is now the U.S. are traditionsof these ancient giants.” 1 Hundreds of stories describing giants exist within Native American folklore.Numerous authors and ethnologists collected their cultural legacy frominteracting with the surviving Indians that chose to share this ancient wisdom,whilst some were fortunately recorded in the written form. Combined with thefirst-hand accounts seen in the previous chapters, these powerful and oftenstartlingly realistic myths suggests that there is a coherent and vast amount ofdata of giant-lore. The authors thought originally when researching thischapter, due to the vastness of North America, we would only find vague anddiffering versions of the giants featured in their tales. What we quicklydiscovered, however, is that many of the descriptions and histories match up,and even provide glimpses of a lost historical timeline. The Bearded GiantsThe Firelands Pioneer Memoirs of Townships, November, 1858Vermilion, Erie County, Ohio This fascinating oral history not only talks about matter-of-fact giant bonesbeing discovered in mounds, but the old stories say that some of the ‘Tall Ones’had beards. This discovery is on the shore of Vermillion in northern Ohio, onLake Erie: “There are quite a number of mounds, in the township, where the bones, andsometimes the whole skeleton of the human race have been found. The bones andskeletons found are very large, and some of the inhabitants think they must havebelonged to a race of beings much larger in size than the Indians found here bythe first settlers....it was a tradition of the Indians that the first tribeoccupying this whole country, was a black-bearded race, very large in size, andsubsequently a red bearded race or tribe came and killed or drove off all theblack beards, as they called them. The Indians found here by the first whitesettlers, belonged principally to the San- dusky, Tawa and Chippewa tribes.” 2 Black-beaded giants getting killed off by red-bearded warriors!? This is verystrange. Why such tales, if it was not a folk memory of some sort? We looked ata map of where Vermillion is in Ohio. It is a beach town, with direct wateraccess to the copper mines of the Great Lakes. The Great Peacemaker, PassaconewayIn the introduction to A Tradition of Giants, Ross Hamilton outlines the storyof a great peacemaker from New England who stood seven feet in height during the1600s. It is worth mentioning here in detail because not only was he a legendaryfigure and taller than average, he was also witnessed by the colonial settlersin the 1600s.Passaconeway-1851.bmp [../Images/image00350.jpeg]As well as being a powerful shaman of the Pennacook tribe, Passaconeway was oneof the last kingly Sachems (Chiefs) of old, who eventually became Bashaba (Chiefof Chiefs) in an effort to to bring together a multi-tribal confederation todefend themselves against the aggressive Mohawk nation. When he was nearing theend of his very long life (he was said to have lived to 120 years old), hetraveled amongst Indians and colonial settlers, and was revered by both duringand after his life.Legend states that he was so powerful, that he could make water burn, make treesand rocks dance, turn dried leaves back to green, and make living snakes out ofdried snake skin.3 One of his powers was to summon storms at will, and he evenresorted to this when white settlers tried to arrest him. The intense rain andwind he manifested, gave him the time to flee into the forest.4 Furthermore,traditions in Britain also tell of giants being able to control the elements,and even after their lives when their graves were disturbed, great storms wouldhalt the progress.5Passaconeway’s powers also continued after his life. During his burial ceremony,a native witness told of his bright ascension over Mount Washington in NewHampshire, which was said to be Great Spirit’s earthly abode.6Although Passaconeway traveled widely around New England, his home base was inLowell, Massachusetts. To this day, a controversial stone circle and a stone‘Beehive Chamber’ reside in an area that was “on the edge of an Indianreservation in 1659,”7 20 years before Passaconeway’s death, suggesting it couldhave been built by the Pennacook tribe. Hugh and Jim have both visited thesesites. The connection between stone and giants does not end there. In these nextexamples, legends of giants made of stone, who also liked the taste of humanflesh are described.lowell-mt-washington.bmp [../Images/image00351.jpeg]Left: ‘Druid Hill’ Stone Circle in Lowell. Right: Mount Washington, NewHampshire. The Stonish Giants & the ShawneeDavid Cusick’s Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations, 1828 David Cusick was a Tuscarora artist and the author of the earliest known accountof Native American history and myth, written and published in English by anIndian. He was also the first to publish accounts of giants from the stories ofthe Indians, at a time when enormous skeletons were being reportedly discoveredacross the country. His description and corresponding illustration of theinfamous ‘stonish giants’ was further researched and published by HenrySchoolcraft in 1846.Stonish_Giants--Wiki.jpg [../Images/image00352.jpeg] Notes on the Iroquois, Henry Schoolcraft, 1846 Henry Rowe Schoolcraft was an American explorer and ethnologist noted for hisdiscovery of the source of the Mississippi River and for his writings on thenative peoples of the North American Plains. He collected many myths fromvarious tribes, most notably the Ojibwe, but this one was collected later in hislife and describes the cannibalistic stone giants legend of the Shawnee, whowere a nomadic tribe but centered around Ohio (where, incidentally, hundreds ofgiant skeletons have been uncovered): “The country was invaded by a still more fearful enemy, namely: theOR-NE-YAR-HEG, or Stonish Giants. They were a powerful tribe from thewilderness, tall, fierce and hostile, and resistance to them was (in) vain. Theydefeated and overwhelmed an army which was sent out against them, and put thewhole country in fear. These giants were not only of prodigious strength, butthey were cannibals, devouring men, women and children in their inroads.It is said by the Shawnees, that they were descended from a certain family,which journeyed on the east side of the Mississippi, after the vine broke, andthey went towards the northwest. Abandoned to wandering and the hardships of theforest, they forgot the rules of humanity, and began at first, to eat raw flesh,and next men. They practiced rolling themselves in the sand, and by this meanstheir bodies were covered with hard skin, so that the arrows of the Iroquoisonly rattled against their rough bodies, and fell at their feet. And theconsequence was, that they were obliged to hide in caves, and glens, and werebrought into subjection by these fierce invaders for many winters, (or years.)At length the Holder of the Heavens, visited his people, and finding that theywere in great distress, he determined to grant them relief, and rid thementirely of these barbarous invaders. To accomplish this, he changed himselfinto one of these giants, and brandishing his heavy club, led them on, under thepretense of finding the Akonoshioni. When they had got near to their strong holdat Onondaga, night coming on, he bid them lie down in a hollow, telling themthat he would make the attack at the customary hour, at day break. But at daybreak, having ascended a height, he overwhelmed them with a vast mass of rocks,where their forms may yet be seen. Only one escaped to carry the news of theirdreadful fate, and he fled towards the north.”8 Extermination of the Stone GiantsRelated by Mr. O’Beille, 1892 Further stories of the stone giants existed in the far west of the countryand this oral history recounts their migrations towards the east, and tells howthey were finally defeated: “The stone giants, who principally inhabited the far West, resolved to come Eastand exterminate the Indians. A party of Senecas, just starting out on thewar-path, were warned of their impending danger and were bidden to accept thechallenge to fight the stone giants and appoint a time and place. This they did.At the appointed time the giants appeared at the place, which was near a greatgulf. Then there came a mighty wind from the west which precipitated the wholerace of giants down into the abyss, from which they were never able to extricatethemselves, and the God of the West Wind was ever after held in reverence by theSenecas.” 9 The Stone Giant’s Wife Further in the same text, another story tells of how a stone giant’s wife soughthelp from another native woman. Whilst dealing with the game and animals herchief husband had been collecting during hunting, she was startled by hearing awoman’s voice coming out of her wigwam. She looked in and saw a stone giantwoman nursing the chief’s child. “Do not be afraid,” said the giantess; “comein.” As the wife sat down she told her that she had run away from her cruelhusband who wanted to kill her, and that she wished to stay a while with thechiefs family. She had come from very far, from the land of the stone giants,and was very tired, and added that they must be careful what food they gave her.She could not eat raw meat; it must be well cooked, so thoroughly cooked, thatshe could not taste the blood, for if she tasted blood she might wish to killthem and the child and eat them. She knew that the woman’s husband was a greathunter, and she knew that his wife brought in the game, but now she would bewilling to go hunting instead.After a while she returned, bringing in one hand a load which four ordinary mencould not have carried. The terrified native woman cooked it and they dinedtogether. As evening came on the stone giantess bade the woman go out and meether husband and tell him of her visit; so she started, and the hunter was muchpleased to hear of the help she had given.In the morning, after he had gone on his hunting expedition, the giantess said,“Now I have a secret for you: My husband is after me. In three days he will behere. We shall have a terrible fight when he comes, and you and your husbandmust help me to kill him.”Two days afterwards she said, “Now your husband must remain at home, for mine iscoming. But do not be afraid; we shall kill him, only you must help catch andhold him. I will show you where to strike him so that the blow will go rightthrough to his heart.” The hunter and his wife were both frightened at this, butshe reassured them and they all three awaited the coming of the giant. So sheplaced herself in the entrance, and as he came in sight she was ready. Sheseized him and threw him on the ground. “Now,” she said, “strike him on thearms, now on the back of the neck”; and so he was finally killed. Then she said,“I will take him out and bury him,” which she then did.She stayed a while quietly with the hunter and his wife, fetching in the gameand being useful until they were ready to leave and return to the settlement.Then she said, “Now I must go home to my people, for I need fear nothing.” Soshe bade them farewell. And this is the end of the story of the Stone Giantess.This story is very weird on many levels, as it has a matter-of-fact edge to it.It’s particularly mythical, and shows a humane side to the female stonegiants....as long as they are not fed raw meat!These stories of the stone giants is a stark reflection of the tradition of theMewuk Indians of California on the other side of the country. Stone Giants of CaliforniaEthnological Evidence that the California Cave Skeletons are not RecentScience, New Series, Vol. 29, No. 751, May 21, 1909, pp. 805-806 The Mewuk Indians of the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada in NorthernCalifornia have a legend of a cannibalistic ‘rock giant’ (another name for stonegiant) who once dwelt in the caves on their lands: ”These Indians believe the caves to be inhabited by a stone giant, whom theycall Chelalumche, who salliees forth at night in search of food. He preys, bypreference, on people, but when he cannot get people, takes deer or otheranimals. He never eats his victims in the open but carries them into the cavesand there devours them. Members of several subtribes have told me this, and havelooked with horror on the suggestion that they or their ancestors might everhave put their dead in caves.”Che-ha-lum%27-che%20the%20Rock%20Giant%20catching%20People%20to%20eat.bmp[../Images/image00353.jpeg]Image: Chehalumche, the rock giant catching people to eat. This comment was in response to the discovery of the Calaveras Skull that wasdiscovered in February 1866. This has been dismissed as a hoax by archaeologistsbecause it was found in a Pliocene layer, beneath a layer of lava dated to overtwo million years old. More recent remains have also been found in caves in thearea, but the Mewuk rebuff the idea that they would bury their dead in the cavesinhabited by giants. They say: “Would you put your mother, or your wife, or your child, or any one you love, ina cave to be eaten by a horrible giant?” 10 They claim that they never used this burial technique, so any remains must havebeen the result of the unfortunate victims of Chelalumche, the stone giant.Interestingly, there are no migration myths associated with the Mewuk, and thestories of the giant relate to a prehistoric era, long before the time of themodern Indians of that area. Other myths of cannibalistic giants in the areainclude this next account. Yayali the GiantMiwok Myths, by Edward Winslow Gifford, 1917UCPAE, Vol. 12, No. 8, pp. 283-338 Yayali also had a taste for human flesh. “Where are you, grandchild? Where are you, grandchild? Where are you? Where areyou? Yes. Yes. I am lost. Where are you? This way. Where are you, grandchild?Someone comes. Look out. Get ready. Prepare yourself, for Yayali comes.” The story goes that the people broke cones from the tops of the pine trees andbundled these together. As Yayali started to climb the declivity where thepeople had taken refuge, they set fire to the bundles of pinecones and threwthem into Yayali’s burden basket. Yayali became so hot that he tumbled. “Whichway shall I fall?” he asked. They told him to fall to the north. The giant methis death near Columbia, Tuolumne County. Nearby white rocks are reputed to bethe bleached bones of the giant.Another elaborate story relates that when he visited a local tribe, heoverpowered them and killed and ate a man called Chipmunk. He then forcedhimself upon his terrified wife, but the wife hid the daughter she had withChipmunk, and although the giant kept hunting humans and forcing his wife to eatthe flesh of her kin, she secretly cooked and ate deer flesh, and gave that toher hidden daughter.She eventually got pregnant, and gave birth to two giant sons, who she wanted tokill, but feared Yayali would seek revenge on her. Living in constant fear, shesecretly spoke to her tribe, including Chipmunk’s family, who decided to getsome obsidian so she could cut his face and kill the giant and his children.They tricked Yayali and cut his head off, then cut up his body and hung theparts up on trees. Meanwhile, Yayali’s brother’s dreamt of their sibling andvisited the tribe, not knowing he was dead. They heard the rumors of his humanhunting prowess, so ate the meat on the trees. They then noticed their brother’sdead head next to the spring, so retaliated and chased the woman, but she threwobsidian powder in their eyes, but they chased her to Chipmunks fathers home whowas a shaman. They hid inside and called on the elements of wind, snow and hail,but the giants shouted loudly and were able to melt the snow. The shaman thencalled on the element of water and soon a flood came and drowned them. This wasthe end of their terrifying ordeal. More Cannibalism! Human flesh eating was not confined to just these previous examples. The Mi’kmaqNation were a member of the Wabanaki Confederacy that controlled northern NewEngland and the Canadian coastline including northeastern Maine.11 This is fromMicmac mythology recorded in 1809: “We find records of horrible man-eating giants called Kookweijik; and anotherfamily of enormous beings called Ooskoon Kookwesijek—the liver-colored giantswho return from their hunting expeditions carrying at their belts a string ofcaribou as easily as a Micmac could carry a string of rabbits. These tawnygiants are friendly, as is shown by their dealings with a party of Micmacsrecorded in Legend XVII; the party had been lost in a fog for several days in ornear St. John Harbour, and afterwards held their powerful deliverers in faithfulremembrance…” 12 To this we might add this from the Hotcâk tribe from the Lake Winnebago area ofWisconsin. These giants also had a taste for torso: “Not only are the Giants by nature man eaters, as their Hotcâk name Wángerútcgereveals, but male Giants are as tall as trees, four times the height of a man.On the other hand, Giant women, who are particularly noted for their beauty, areabout the same size as humans.” 13 Later on the text it describes a modern ‘attack’ by one of the giants: “There may be a few solitary Giants left, since in historical times an Ice Giantattacked a man on the Wisconsin River between Stevens Point and WisconsinRapids. It was only because he was carrying a powerful medicine with him that hewas able to fend off his huge opponent until his friends could come to hisrescue.This was written in 1941. Others, however, say that this race of malignant maneaters disappeared completely around 1840 when the last of them was killed offby a Good Giant who reduced himself in size to live among the humans and blessthem.” 14 Whether he actually ate the victim was not discussed, but does hint that eveninto historical times, the giants may have existed in this area. Indian Legends from the Northern RockiesBy Ella Elizabeth Clark, University of Oklahoma Press, 1966 The Kutenais tribe were based in northern Idaho and had multiple stories ofgiants in their myths, with quite a number who—you guessed it—munched on humans: “...giants followed the big streams and that whenever Indians went to a bigstream, giants killed them and ate them.” 15 William Gingrass, Clarks main Indian informant also said: “My great-grandmother’s uncle, once found the skeleton of a giant, buried in asitting position, in a grave near (Lake) Superior.” 16 The ‘Flatheads’ of Montana were their neighbors and “Fully half of the Flatheadstories deal with these giants, and easily two-thirds mention them”. Here is oneexample: “Their ancestors reported that there was a time when a large portion of theearth was inhabited by a set of giants, terrible men, who killed everyone theymet with, for which they were called Natliskeliguten, which in the ancientlanguage means killer of men; that Sinchlep [Coyote] in pity for the smallerpeople, went through the earth, killed every giant, and converted them all intolarge stones; and even of late, when Flatheads in crossing the mountains saw abasaltic rock standing upright on the top, they said to one another, ‘Keepaside, there is Natliskeliguten, killed by Sinchlep,” and every large piece ofSilex they saw around was for them a fragment of an arrow of the killers of men....” 17 This reference to standing stones is fascinating, as we know that NativeAmericans certainly worked with stone in many parts of the country (see next twochapters). Stories like this tantalizingly hint that erecting megaliths andmounds was part of an age-old tradition that continued until relatively moderntimes.This passage is from the chapter entitled Myths of the Mountains, talking aboutthe very early ancestors of the Indians near Mount Hood in Portland, Oregon: “In those days the Indians were also taller than they are now. They were as tallas the pine and fir trees that cover the hills, and their chief was such a giantthat his warriors could walk under his outstretched arms.” 18 The Woman and the GiantsLegends of the Paiute, Nevada This legend talks about cannibalistic giants and their relationship to theorigins of the Paiute tribe in the Nevada area. The significance of this willbecome clear, because some astonishing mummified remains and artifactswere discovered in the region that match many of the traits of this story: “There was a giant named Tse’nahaha who killed people just by looking at them.He carried a large basket full of thorns on his back and when he caught someonehe would throw them into the basket.Some Indians were playing a game in a house and were having fun. They hadstationed a woman outside to watch for Tse’nahaha. She heard him coming – he wastalking and singing to himself. She tried to warn people that he was coming butthey did not hear her. Tse’nahaha was getting closer and the women becamefrightened and jumped into a pit and pulled a basket over herself.Tse’nahaha came up to the house and looked around. He made a sucking noise andwhen he looked at anyone in the house they died instantly. The others would seethe dead staring and ask what they were looking at, but then they too sawTse’nahaha and died. Soon all were dead and only a baby was left sleeping.Tse’nahaha left.The baby began to cry and it was almost daylight. The woman left the pit andwent in to the house but did not look at the dead. She called to the baby andtook baby away and set the house on fire. She dug kani’d while the baby ate andslept.Pu’wihi, another giant came along and picked up the baby. He held the headbetween his second and third finger and carried him to the woman. He asked whereshe was from and she answered that she was from the house over there – the onethat has the smoke pouring from it. There are many people in it. The giantturned towards the house and the woman was frightened and hid.When the giant returned and could not see her he became angry. But he found theway she had jumped away from her tracks and found her under a rock crying. Itwas too dark to see and he decided to come back in the morning. He thought hewould make a fire and grind up the baby. He found a large rock and ground up thebaby and ate him. He lay there singing and after awhile he went to sleep. Thewoman got up and made another jump towards the east to her aunts house.She was safe at her Aunts house and the giant could not see the mark of herstick from where she jumped—because she had jumped from a rock. This womanbecame the ancestor of all the Paiute Indians.” 19 Another similar legend was reported in 1891. It recalls: “...an indian of giant stature, who gave them trouble. They say that the giantwarrior came from the north. He took up his abode near Pyramid Lake, and madewar on the Piutes, killing many of their men. The giant was finally slain byPiute David, who crept up behind him and drove a poisoned arrow into his back,between the shoulder blades.” 20 Interestingly, it mentions giant footprints in the area that were still reveredby the Piaute at the time, plus a giant’s grave that was kept clear ofvegetation by the tribe. They could be referring to a series of oversizedfootprints that were famously discovered in nearby Carson. These were measuredat 18 to 21 inches long and dated to the Pliocene (approx. two million yearsold).21 The Red-Haired Cannibals of Lovelock CaveNevada The Paiute covered a huge area through Nevada, Utah, Idaho and California. TheNorthern Paiute resided around the now mostly dry Humboldt Lake near Lovelock, asmall town about 80 miles north-east of Reno. Below is an excerpt from LifeAmong the Piutes; an account of a tribe of red-haired cannibals called the“Si-Te-Cah”, written by Paiute activist and lecturer, Sarah Winnemucca Hopkinsin 1882. It does not mention their size, but the first excavation in 1904reported discovering an incredibly tall skeleton, with further accounts from1911 onwards. This account has all the characteristics of the other man-eatinggiant legends: “Among the traditions of our people is one of a small tribe of barbarians whoused to live along the Humboldt River. It was many hundred years ago. They usedto waylay my people and kill and eat them. They would dig large holes in ourtrails at night, and if any of our people travelled at night, which they did,for they were afraid of these barbarous people, they would oftentimes fall intothese holes. That tribe would even eat their own dead—yes, they would even comeand dig up our dead after they were buried, and would carry them off and eatthem. Now and then they would come and make war on my people. They would fight,and as fast as they killed one another on either side, the women would carry offthose who were killed. My people say they were very brave. When they werefighting they would jump up in the air after the arrows that went over theirheads, and shoot the same arrows back again. My people took some of them intotheir families, but they could not make them like themselves. So at last theymade war on them. This war lasted a long time.Sarah_Winnemucca_Hopkins.bmp [../Images/image00354.jpeg] Their number was about twenty-six hundred (2600). The war lasted some threeyears. My people killed them in great numbers, and what few were left went intothe thick bush. My people set the bush on fire. This was right above HumboldtLake. Then they went to work and made tuly or bulrush boats, and went intoHumboldt Lake. They could not live there very long without fire. They werenearly starving. My people were watching them all round the lake, and would killthem as fast as they would come on land. At last one night they all landed onthe east side of the lake, and went into a cave near the mountains. It was amost horrible place, for my people watched at the mouth of the cave, and wouldkill them as they came out to get water. My people would ask them if they wouldbe like us, and not eat people like coyotes or beasts. They talked the samelanguage, but they would not give up. At last my people were tired, and theywent to work and gathered wood, and began to fill up the mouth of the cave. Thenthe poor fools began to pull the wood inside till the cave was full. At last mypeople set it on fire; at the same time they cried out to them, “Will you giveup and be like men, and not eat people like beasts? Say quick – we will put outthe fire.” No answer came from them. My people said they thought the cave mustbe very deep or far into the mountain. They had never seen the cave nor known itwas there until then. They called out to them as loud as they could, “Will yougive up? Say so, or you will all die.” But no answer came. Then they all leftthe place. In ten days some went back to see if the fire had gone out. They wentback to my third or fifth great-grandfather and told him they must all be dead,there was such a horrible smell. This tribe was called people-eaters, and aftermy people had killed them all, the people round us called us Say-do-carah[Si-Te-Cah]. It means conqueror; it also means ‘enemy.’” 22 Interestingly, Hopkins had evidence they existed: “My people say that the tribe we exterminated had reddish hair. I have some oftheir hair, which has been handed down from father to son. I have a dress whichhas been in our family a great many years, trimmed with the reddish hair. I amgoing to wear it some time when I lecture. It is called a mourning dress, and noone has such a dress but my family.” 23 In 1904, 22 years after the publication of her book, a larger-than-life skeletonwas reportedly unearthed in the area said to be an 11 feet tall: Bones of a Giant are Dug UpThe Evening News, January 14, 1904 pg.8Winnemucca, Nevada “Workmen engaged in digging gravel here uncovered at a depth of about twelvefeet a lot of bones that once belonged to a gigantic human being. Joseph Rougon,who was in charge of the work, examined the bones and at once decided that theywere those of a man or a woman. They were taken to Dr. Samuels who examined themthoroughly and pronounced them to be the bones of a man who must have beennearly eleven feet in height. The metacarpal bone measure four and a half inchesin length and are large in proportion. A part of the ulna was found which incomplete form would have been between seventeen and eighteen inches in length.The remaining part of the skeleton is being searched for.”The%20Evening%20News%20-%20Jan%2014%2c%201904%20pg%208.jpg[../Images/image00355.jpeg] In October 1936, the Nevada State Journal amended the size of the original 11 ftdiscovery: “Many stories credited it with being 11 feet tall. The truth is that the figure,still with reddish hair on the skull, was 9 ½ feet in length.” 24Entrance_to_Lovelock_Cave%2c_Near_Lovelock%2c_Nevada_(529142604).bmp[../Images/image00356.jpeg] However, a certain institution from the East Coast got involved: “The mummy is now in Washington D.C. It is the largest human specimen everdiscovered.” 25 Mummified bodies with red hair were reported discovered between 1911-12 innearby Lovelock Cave, when guano businessmen discovered hundreds of artifactsencased in bird-poop. It got to a point where there were more artifacts thanguano, so anthropologists were called in to take over. Within two years, over10,000 artifacts had been recorded. Many showed signs of fairly advancedtechnology for the time. These included duck decoys, oversized sandals, stonetools and baskets, all dating back several thousand years.Lovelock_Cave_decoy_Autry-wikimedia-commons.bmp [../Images/image00357.jpeg] Similar artifacts found in nearby Hidden Cave have been dated to 9,000 yearsold26, whilst in Spirit Cave two mummified bodies were discovered, with one ofthem dating to 9,400 years old, the oldest known in America and contemporarywith Kennewick Man. Although the oldest official carbon-dating (of vegetation)found within Lovelock Cave is 2,740 BC,27 could the red-haired tribe of LovelockCave be much older and possibly be the ancestors of their archaic Spirit Caveneighbors?James H. Hart and David Pugh got the rights to dig and sell guano at LovelockCave in the fall of 1911, but when they started finding Indian artifacts theyrecalled that in the north-central part of the cave, at about four feet deep,“was a striking looking body of a man ‘six feet six inches tall.’ His body wasmummified and his hair distinctly red.” 28In the first year of mining some of the human remains and smaller artifacts werelost or destroyed. “The best specimen of the adult mummies was boiled anddestroyed by a local fraternal lodge, which wanted the skeleton for initiationpurposes.”29 We recently found out this was in fact the Fallon FraternalSociety30 so it would be interesting to see if they have this on record. Otherskeletons made their way to the Nevada State Historical Society, but even in1978, they excused themselves from investigation by saying “...none of theinstitutions had any knowledge of the red-haired people’s remains.”31Pestle from Lovelock area.In%20Situ%20Pestle%208-11%20fig.bmp [../Images/image00358.jpeg]Further accounts go into more detail. For example, the supposed discovery ofanother “...skeleton of a man well over 6 ½ feet tall” was announced in 1975.32This could well have been the one in possession of Clarence Stoker, who was saidto have gathered a huge collection of artifacts and a skeleton between 6 and 7feet tall in the 1960s. In the same article it mentions a curious 4-inch,donut-shaped stone “...with 365 dots on the outside edge and 52 dots on theinside. It is unmistakably a calendar”.33 Further discoveries of incrediblylarge pestle and mortars were found in Lovelock Cave and the surrounding area,hinting that larger than average humans used them.lovelock-jaw.bmp [../Images/image00359.jpeg]Some fairly large skulls were also discovered, and four examples discovered byStoker were still on display at the museum, but are now locked away in thebasement. One of the jaws was photographed next to a cast of a modern human jaw,that showed the difference in size. Micah Ewers calculated that it is between12% and 20% larger than the control.This photo was published in a newspaper in November 1914 showing an 11-inch-tallskull, which is considerably larger than a normal human skull.34 The TelegraphHerald elaborated on the discovery the following month: “The human skulls which were strewn in great profusion about the floor of thecave show proportions which indicate a race of men of great stature.”351914-11inch-skull.bmp [../Images/image00360.jpeg] Another skull was unearthed in early 1967 a few miles southwest ofLovelock Cave. It was studied by anthropologists at Utah University andpublished by Erik K. Reed who said “The skull is large.”36 He made closecomparisons to previously discovered skulls from the Southwest to determine itsage; one that was 6,900 years old, another 8,000 years old, and one example“undoubtedly much older”. It had a “notably strong browridge... strong nuchalcrest...retreating forehead... massive occipital torus or crest.” 37 It wasclassed among the ‘Early Period Central California material’, who also haveoversized occipital buns and glabellar prominences (crest between the eyes abovethe nose). Strangely, occipital buns are a feature found in 81.8% of Neanderthalskulls but only in 60% of upper paleolithic skulls,38 and it is rare amongmodern humans. Like the skull at Spirit Cave, it had modern human features andred-hair.Also found were a number of fiber sandals that were remarkably large, with onereported to be over 15 inches (38 cm) in length that was on display at theNevada Historical Society’s Museum in Reno in 1952.39 Micah Ewers, an Oregonbased researcher got access to the artifacts at the museum and confirmed thatthe shoe sizes include a 10.5 (US men’s size); a size 11 and size 12 and one setof size 15 sandals existed, that could have fitted the feet of the 6 feet 6 inchtall gentleman snugly.The traits of the red-hair, cannibalism and war-like nature of the Paiute’smortal enemy spoken about by Sarah Hopkins was confirmed from another source in1913: “...a tribe of cannibals, described by the Paiutes as small of stature,having red hair and freckled faces”.40 The “small stature” does contradict theinitial discovery of the taller than average skeletons, but it is worth notinghere as an anomaly.Paiute traditions asserts that the Si-Te-Cah practiced cannibalism, and this mayhave some basis in fact. During the 1924 excavation of the cave, three humanbones were found just beneath the surface towards the entrance of the cave:“These had been split to extract the marrow, as animal bones were split, andprobably indicate cannibalism during a famine.”41Their origins are still shrouded in mystery, but so are many of the tribes we’vebeen looking at in this chapter. Red-hair and cannibalistic tendencies, and now,as with Spirit Cave Man, dating that goes back 9,400 years, there is clearlymore to this area of ancient America than was once thought. Wah-Zee-YahTales of Fort Snelling, 1849 The Sioux, who were based around Fort Snelling in Minnesota, have legends of theWetuc or ‘race of men who stood as tall as the tall trees’, as outlined in thisaccount from 1849: “Iron Members was going hunting, and when he was near Shah-co-pee’s village, hemet the Giant. He wore a three-cornered hat, and one side was bright as the sun;so bright one could not look upon it; and he had a crooked thing upon hisshoulder…The Dahcotahs believe firmly the story of Iron Members. He was one oftheir wisest men. He was a great warrior and knew how to kill his enemies.” 42 Henry Rowe SchoolcraftThe Scholar and the Giants In the mid 1800’s Henry Rowe Schoolcraft did a great deal to both further andhinder Indian traditions. He married a woman of native stock, with whom hecollected hundred of myths from various Indian tribes, but unfortunatelyreported on the people in a general way thus: The Indian has a low, bushy brow, beneath which a dull, sleepy, half-closed eyeseems to mark the ferocious passions that are dormant within. The acute anglesof the eyes seldom present the obliquity so common in the Malays and theMongolians. The color of the eye is almost uniformly a tint between black andgrey; but even in young persons it seldom has the brightness, or expresses thevivacity, so common in the more civilized races.43 Whether this was the stance expected of him, or whether he had become grumpy inold age is unclear, but he did most of his good work long before the Smithsonianwas formed. In 1822 Schoolcraft married Jane Johnston, part-Ojibwe, who had avast knowledge of Ojibwe legend and history. Later in life in 1846 Congresscommissioned him to develop a comprehensive reference work on American Indiantribes. Schoolcraft worked for years on the history and mythology of the Indiansand the findings were published in six volumes from 1851-1857.44henry-rowe-schoolcraft-granger.bmp [../Images/image00361.jpeg] His far-reaching books are often overlooked today, but one thing that did catchour attention was the fact that he believed the ancestors of the AmericanIndians were responsible for the construction of the mounds, not a prehistoricwhite race, or some other exotic interloper. However, attributing the mounds toa mysterious foreign race is a tradition that comes up in various other mythsfrom around the country collected by others (as we will soon see). Notes on the Iroquois, 1847 Schoolcraft shares their creation stories that includes this passage about somelegendary giants: “By their earliest traditions, we are told that a body of the Ongwe Honwe,encamped on the banks of the St. Lawrence, where they were invaded by a nationfew in number, but of giant stature, called Ronongweca.” 45 Further in the book, a tantalising glimpse may establish one of the reasons suchlarge earthen and stone forts were built in prehistory: “It is affirmed by their traditions, that, in the older periods of theiroccupancy of this continent, they were even obliged, or their fears suggestedthe measure, to build coverts and forts to protect themselves and families fromthe inroads of monsters, giants and gigantic animals....Such places would affordconvenient shelters for their women and children.” 46 Does this suggest the great forts may have been constructed to protect thenative inhabitants from marauding cannibalistic giants. Like any majorarchitectural construction, there needs to be a collective reason and efforts,to go ahead with such projects, such as modern dams and power stations to supplyenergy. This is as good a reason as any, to protect one’s tribe from the dangersof the outside world, including man-eating giants. White Feather and the Six GiantsThe Indian Fairy Book, by H.R. Schoolcraft In Schoolcrafts 1856 work called The Indian Fairy Book, he reveals a furthergiant myth. It is a long and complicated adventure about a child who’s familywas killed by a tribe of giants. Six of these giants remained, who resided in a“high lodge” deep in the woods but eventually the boy fulfils a prophecy, goesthrough multiple challenges, and kills them all off. The giants even used magicto sneak in to the Indians village and disguise themselves as normal sizedhumans, and one of them even married one of the Indian women.Schoolcraft’s legacy is a national treasure that gives a portal in to theprehistory of the ancient Americans that has long since been lost. Vine Deloria Jr.Red Earth, White Lies: Native Americans and the Myth of Scientific Fact Vine Deloria, Jr. (1933-2005) was a Native American scholar, theologian,historian, and activist, who collected many stories of giants in his decades ofresearch: “From talking with elders of several tribes, my understanding is that theIndians were and are describing people of more than average height. In fact,some elders as a routine matter have reported that the Indians themselves weremuch larger and taller.” 47 In his classic book Red Earth, White Lies: Native Americans and the Myth ofScientific Fact (1997), it describes numerous legends of the Tall Ones, andchallenges the way science is recorded and published, especially in relation toNative Americans. Ross Hamilton worked closely with Deloria to uncover andrebuild the lost history of the great wars that took place between varioustribes in prehistory, that we explore later in this chapter. One of the greatwarring tribes of North America were the Comanche.vine-deloria.bmp [../Images/image00362.jpeg] Three Years Among the Comanches, 1859Ten Feet Tall White Giants Nelson Lee’s detailed account of his life as a Texas Ranger, his subsequentcapture by the Comanche people, and his escape through the mountains back to hiscolonial settlement, is a fascinating story that also demonstrates the innerworkings of an Indian tribe who were changed forever by the interference of onewhite man. He came to admire some of his captors and even married a woman fromthe tribe. He learnt their myths and history and wrote about them in his 1859book: “Innumerable moons ago, a race of white men, ten feet high, and far more richand powerful than any white people now living, here inhabited a large range ofcountry, extending from the rising to the setting sun. Their fortificationscrowned the summits of the mountains, protecting their populous cities situatedin the intervening valleys. They excelled every other nation which hasflourished, either before or since, in all manner of cunning handicraft—werebrave and warlike—ruling over the land they had wrested from its ancientpossessors, with a high and haughty hand. Compared with them the pale faces ofthe present day, were as pigmies, both in art and arms. They drove the Indiansfrom their homes, putting them to the sword, and occupying the valleys in whichtheir fathers had dwelt before them since the world began. At length, in theheight of their power and glory, when they remembered justice and mercy no more,and became proud and lifted up, the Great Spirit descended from above, sweepingthem with fire and deluge from the face of the earth. The mounds we had seen onthe table lands were the remnants of their fortresses, and the crumbling ruinsthat surrounded us, all that remained of a mighty city. In like manner,continued The Rolling Thunder, the day will surely come when the present whiterace, which is driving the Indians before it, and despoiling them of theirinheritance, and which, in the confidence of its strength, has become arrogantand boastful and forgotten God, will be swept from existence. For the GreatSpirit is just,—and as certainly as the rivers flow downward towards the saltsea, or the sun rises in the morning and sets at night, so certainly will He yetrestore the land of their fathers to the red man, when the days of hisaffliction are passed.” 48 This powerful passage echoes the frustration of the Indians, who had to tolerateabuse and slaughter at the hands of the Western invaders, much like the way thegiants of old treated them. Further accounts of ‘fairskinned’ giants are found in other parts of the country. Tsul’Kalu’ & the Cherokee Slant-Eyed Giants In Jackson County, North Carolina, a series of 3,000 year-old petroglyphs aredisplayed on Judaculla Rock, a prehistoric monolith protruding from the ground,said to have been there long before the Cherokee arrived. Researcher Micah Hankslooked into the meaning of the strange carvings on the rock, most notably thehandprint: “According to legend, this portion of the stone marks the place where an ancientCherokee god of the hunt, known as Tsul’Kalu’, had leaped from a nearbymountain, and landing within the valley below, had steadied himself against whatis now Judaculla Rock”.49 The name is also a reference to a race of giants who came from the west andinteracted with the early Cherokee. James Mooney collected this story that waspublished by the Smithsonian in 1900: “James Wafford, of the western Cherokee, who was born in Georgia in 1806, saysthat his grandmother, who must have been born about the middle of the lastcentury, told him that she had heard from the old people that long before hertime a party of giants had once come to visit the Cherokee. They were nearlytwice as tall as common men, and had their eyes set slanting in their heads, sothat the Cherokee called them Tsunil´ kalu´, “the Slant-eyed people,” becausethey looked like the giant hunter Tsul´ kalu´. They said that these giants livedfar away in the direction in which the sun goes down. The Cherokee received themas friends, and they stayed some time, and then returned to their home in thewest.” 50judaculla-rock_n-c-archives.jpg [../Images/image00363.jpeg] Some commentators suggest they could be describing Oriental facial features: “In 1524, the Spaniard Giovanni de Verrazano, having explored parts of theeastern coastline, described the native people in the area of what wasapparently aboriginal Lenape territory as having faces that tend to be broad,and large dark eyes, resembling the “Orientals.” 51 Cryptozoologists believe Tsul’Kalu may have been a version of Sasquatch,52because he was said to have lived in caves. Other stories say he cleared theside of a mountain to live there, and even had relations with a Cherokee woman.In this particular legend, it talks about how a mother wanted her daughter tomarry a good hunter. Tsul’Kalu, a being of giant stature, started frequentingher home, but only by night bringing deer and other animals to eat. He alwaysleft before dawn, and appeared to have psychic abilities, as he always knew whatthe demanding mother wanted next—meat or wood. The mother demanded to meet herdaughter’s new husband, and when she did, she was terrified by his appearance.She fled, and the couple magically had a baby, that her family tried to getback, but Tsul’Kalu escaped and was never seen again.Notice here that he only came out at night, as this echoes a later myth of theCherokee, the moon-eyed people. The Moon-Eyed People & the Welsh Prince In Fort Mountain State Park in Georgia, an ancient megalithic wall, shaped likea 1,000-foot-serpent has been linked to some very odd traditions of theCherokee. These range from yellow-haired giants, to moon-eyed people, to Welshprinces from the 1100s. The yellow-haired ones were said to be an ancient racein the area before the Cherokee. Serpent Fort certainly looks like it wasconstructed by giants, as it is estimated it once stood 18 feet tall; itspurpose still unknown.Fort_mountain_wall_01.bmp [../Images/image00364.jpeg] Another tradition states that a group of moon-eyed people lived in the area ofAppalachia, until they were pushed out by the Cherokee. In a 1797 book byBenjamin Smith Barton, he says they were call moon-eyed because they saw poorlyduring the day.53 Another story relates that they were wiped out when attackedon a full moon, because they almost went blind during the moon’s maximumbrightness.Strangely one old story describes them as “very small people, perfectly white”54so not giants at all. Numerous other legends were collected by James Mooney whodescribed a “dim but persistent tradition” of a white race, who were responsiblefor building the sites such as Serpent Fort.In an 1810 letter from Tennessee governor John Sevier, he described that in 1782or 83 he was told a long-standing tradition by Cherokee Chief Oconostota, thatwhite people had built the forts and were pushed away by the Cherokee, but alsosaid they were called “Welsh” and had come from across the ocean with a captaincalled “Madoc”. Sevier also believed that the alleged discovery of six skeletonsin brass armor bearing the Welsh coat of arms discovered in the area wastheirs.55 Welsh tradition also stated that he did indeed exist and took tenships across the ocean around 1170 AD. He even returned to Wales and madeanother journey back to America, never to be seen or heard from again. EvenQueen Elizabeth I and John Dee used this as leverage to try and gain a footholdin America.Madoc was said to have landed at Mobile Bay, Alabama and then sailed up theAlabama River to the area of several ancient earth and stone fortifications,including Serpent Fort. Could these really have been the yellow-haired or evenmoon-eyed people of legend? There is little evidence of this, but tantalisingtraditions like this persist throughout ancient America.Legends_Prince_Madoc_of_Wales.bmp [../Images/image00365.jpeg] Life of Joseph Brant -ThayendanegaIncludes the Wars of the American Revolutionby William L. Stone, 1838 Thayendanegea, or Joseph Brant (1743 – 1807) was a Mohawk military and politicalleader, based in present-day New York, who was closely associated with Britainduring and after the American Revolution. Due to this, he met many of the mostsignificant Anglo-American people of the age, including both George Washingtonand King George III, and was an intellectual, peacemaker, and recorded someinteresting myths of the origins of the Indians around Illinois and Ohio: “A tradition, he said prevailed among the different nations of Indiansthroughout that whole extensive range of country, and had been handed downthrough time immemorial, that in an age long gone by, there came white men froma foreign country, and by consent of the Indians established trading houses andsettlements where these tumuli are found.” 56 Was this really Prince Madoc and the Welsh? Maybe. But there aretraditions of fair-skinned tribes all over America, giant and small, some withblonde and red hair, sometimes with full beards (as we saw with the Duhare ofSouth Carolina), and some who carried all these traits. Unlike the moon-eyedpeople, these were said to be related to the Irish, not the Welsh. The Great Prehistoric American WarBased on the work of Ross Hamilton Many centuries ago, possibly as early as 1,500 BC, the Adena (originally knownas the Lenni Lenape, and most recently the Delaware), moved en masse from anunknown area somewhere in the west of America toward the east. According toChoctaw tradition as conveyed by Vine Deloria Jr. to Ross Hamilton (in apersonal communication), this was the time of the great Exodus. It is said theLenape (Lenni Lenape) were seeking their ultimate destiny in a promised land: “As the legend goes, these people found themselves at the shore of theMississippi—the white man’s enunciation of their Namesi Sipu, River of Fish.There they met up with the nation called Mengwe, who had come from a bit furthernorth and closer to the northern source of the Namesi Sipu, perhaps thepresent-day Missouri, stronghold of the very ancient Siouan Language Group. Itwas a meeting of destiny, and was, at that time, a peaceful one.” 57 The Lenape sent out their scouts across the river to further their advance intonew territory, but they bumped into some larger than life characters. JamesAthearn Jones relates: “They told that they had found the further bank of the River of Fish inhabitedby a very powerful people, who dwelt in great villages, surrounded by highwalls. They were very tall—so tall that the head of the tallest Lenape could notreach their arms, and their women were of higher stature and heavier limbs thanthe loftiest and largest man in the confederate nations. They were called theAllegewi, and were men delighting in red and black paint, and the shrillwar-whoop, and the strife of the spear. Such was the relation made by the spiesto their countrymen.” 58 During his long years of research Henry Schoolcraft noted the persistent,recurring stories of this great prehistoric culture: “The oldest tribe of the United States, of which there is a distinct tradition,were the Alleghans. The term is perpetuated in the principal chain of mountainstraversing the country. This tribe, at an antique period, had the seat of theirpower in the Ohio Valley and its confluent streams, which were the sites oftheir numerous towns and villages.... From the traditions of the Lenapees, givento the Moravian missionaries, while the lamp of their traditionary history stillthrew out its flickering but enlivening flames, the Alleghans had been a strongand mighty people, capable of great exertions and doing wonders.”59 John Heckewelder, assistant to the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger alsowrote about the Alleghans: “Many wonderful things are told of this famous people. They are said to havebeen remarkably tall and stout, and there is a tradition that there were giantsamong them, people of a much larger size than the tallest of the Lenape.” 60 Eventually the Lenape and the Mengwe defeated the giant Alleghans, with theLenape moving eastwards and the Mengwe moving northwards to the Great Lakesarea. “It is speculated that the Mengwe were of pre-Siouan origin, latercombining with the pre-Iroquoian, St. Lawrence-Adirondack people to eventually(much later) evolve into the Iroquois.”61The Adena flourished, and eventually (around 700 BC) moved further east. It isestimated that around 40 tribes of the eastern United States may have Adena(Lenape) ancestry. Unfortunately the Adena lost their giant traits and many oftheir tall memnbers joined the Wolf Tribe otherwise known as the Susquehanna: “Tuscarora David Cusick (1780-1840) writes in 1825 that among the legends of thepeople of the ancient stock, there was a powerful tribe called Ronnongwetowanca.They were giants, and had a “considerable habitation.” The giants were said tohave had a “silly” mode of attack, waiting until their intended victim was notexpecting anything—just as the Allegheny were reported to have done. After atime, and having endured the outrages of these giants, it is said that thepeople banded together, and through the final force of about 800 warriors,successfully annihilated the abhorrent Ronnongwetowanca. After that, it was saidthat there was no great tribe of giants. This was supposed to have happenedaround 2,500 winters before Columbus discovered America, i.e. around 1000BCE—the time the archaeological Adena seem to have commenced their appearance inthe Ohio Valley. Admittedly, this date is a crucial reference, practicallystanding alone when searching for specificity in the chronology.” 62 This great battle, that some researchers say was a near genocide, becomesevident when looking at skeletal discoveries in mounds and on ancientbattlefield graveyards. Throughout the Ohio Valley and as far west as New Yorkthere are accounts of mounds that have hundreds of skeletons piled in them,often with broken bones and battered skulls. Is this the evidence of this greatwar that took place thousands of years ago in America, between the Adena and thegiant Allegheans? Heckewelder writes: “Having thus united their forces, the Lenape and Mengwe declared war against theAllegewi. And great battles were fought, in which many warriors fell on bothsides…An engagement took place in which hundreds fell, who were afterwardsburied in holes or laid together in heaps and covered over with earth.” 63Examples of this practice include H. H. Blackstone, a resident of Charleston,West Virginia in 1878, who opened a mound and found hundreds of “bodies had beenthrown promiscuously into one common grave”, some that were “eight feet inheight.”64In Indiana, further evidence of a great battle was unearthed in a mounds that“...were so full of bones as to warrant the belief that they originallycontained at least one hundred dead bodies; children of different ages, and thefull grown, appeared to have been piled together promiscuously..... theirpossessors were men of gigantic stature.”65Ross Hamilton details these ancient wars that shaped ancient America in ATradition of Giants, but when the skeletal evidence starts to match up with theNative legends, it is time to start taking these seriously.Ross also noted that the aspect of stature seems to have been deliberatelyprotected through selective rites, with the taller, stronger males honoredthrough ascension to positions of social leadership, as in this example: “The chiefs of the province of Chicora, a portion of what is now South Carolina,were famous for their height, which was supposed to prove their royal blood.” 66 Buffalo Bill and the Giant BoneThe Life of Hon. William F. Cody, Known as Buffalo Bill; The Famous Hunter,Scout and Guide. An Autobiography, 1879. To finish this chapter we have this strange account that occurred in 1871 inWyoming, from the legendary Buffalo Bill: “While we were in the sand-hills, scouting the Niobrara country, the PawneeIndians brought into camp, one night, some very large bones, one of which asurgeon of the expedition pronounced to be the thigh-bone of a human being. TheIndians claimed that the bones they had found were those of a person belongingto a race of people who a long time ago lived in this country. That there wasonce a race of men on the earth whose size was about three times that of anordinary man, and they were so swift and powerful that they could run along-sideof a buffalo, and taking the animal in one arm could tear off a leg and eat themeat as they walked.”“These giants denied the existence of a Great Spirit, and when they heard thethunder or saw the lightning they laughed at it and said that they were greaterthan either. This so displeased the Great Spirit that he caused a greatrain-storm to come, and the water kept rising higher and higher so that it drovethose proud and conceited giants from the low grounds to the hills, and thenceto the mountains, but at last even the mountain tops were submerged, and thenthose mammoth men were all drowned. After the flood had subsided, the GreatSpirit came to the conclusion that he had made man too large and powerful, andthat he would therefore correct the mistake by creating a race of men of smallersize and less strength. This is the reason, say the Indians, that modern men aresmall and not like the giants of old, and they claim that this story is a matterof Indian history, which has been handed down among them from time immemorial.As we had no wagons with us at the time this large and heavy bone was found, wewere obliged to leave it.”Buffalo_Bill_Cody_ca1875.bmp [../Images/image00366.jpeg] The story got all the way back east to Yale College and one Professor OthnielCharles Marsh, head of the paleontology department, was sufficiently interestedin the discovery to lead fossil hunting expeditions into the area later thatyear in search of remains of these giants. Unfortunately, there are no reportsof him finding any.We hope this small selection of Native American legends and stories gives someinsight into the early inhabitants of the continent. When cross-referencing thestories we start to find unusual patterns emerging regarding the giants. Theseinclude red-hair, fair skin, cannibalistic tendencies, and fierce battles thattook place millennia ago. With these legends in mind, the next chapter dealswith the ancient mounds and reports of giant royal burials that have also becomethe stuff of legend. 6785.png [../Images/image00367.jpeg] "},{"pageContent":"4. Giants in the Mounds “During the centuries of Indian domination in this country, the ancientearthworks were left undisturbed. The Indians had no knowledge of a preceedingrace, and they were not vexed by inquiring science as to the nature or originsof the mounds”.1 Mound building began in the United States around 3400 BC with the constructionof Watson Brake, Louisiana. The oldest of the Mound Builder cultures north ofWatson Brake, in the Ohio Valley, was the Adena, who were said to be around from1000 BC to 200 BC in an era known as the Early Woodland Period (in Kentucky fromaround 1200 BC)2 but mounds and Adena type skulls have been found with muchearlier dates.The Adena lived in an area including parts of present-day Ohio, Indiana, WestVirginia, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The Hopewell were saidto have existed between 200 BC and 500 AD during the Middle Woodland Period. TheLate Woodland people, who included the Mississippian culture flourished fromaround 1000 AD to 1600 AD who were in the same general area but went furthersouth and west along the Mississippi River. The Fort Ancient culture (1000 to1750 AD) built huge hill-top forts throughout Ohio. However these sweepinggeneralizations do not give justice to vast and complex civilizations that mayhave been around for a lot longer than history books will allow. Serpent Mound, Ohio The Great Serpent Mound is a 1,370 ft long prehistoric effigy mound located nearPeebles, Ohio. It is on the edge of a plateau that sits on the southwest side ofa meteor impact crater. It is 4.5 km across and has powerful magnetic andgravitational anomalies contributing to it, going deep into the earth, even asfar as the mantle. These anomalies cause all sorts of weather fluctuations andearth energy effects in the form of earth lights. As with many other mound sites(such as Grave Creek Mound and Cahokia), Serpent Mound was built upon a powerfulmagnetic anomaly created by this prehistoric impact.3s%26d-Serpent-Mound.png [../Images/image00368.jpeg] For a long time conventional archaeology dated Serpent Mound to the LateWoodland period of 1,070 AD, but this is now almost universally disputed withrecent radiocarbon analysis putting it at around 321 BC,4 one year after thedeath of Aristotle. This puts it in the realm of the Adena who were present inthe area at this time. The so-called Fort Ancient culture may have helped tomaintain the site, but were not the original builders.Hugh met up with Ross Hamilton and researcher Jeffrey Wilson at Serpent Mound inSeptember 2012 to explore the site and get a sense of what was once going onthere. Jeffrey and Ross took Hugh up to the edge of the crater to see thepanoramic view of the surrounding landscape, with local residents telling themabout the strange weather patterns that affect this area.serpent-mound-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00369.jpeg] The coils of the serpent are aligned to the two yearly equinoxes and solstices;a subject both Hugh and Jim had a chance hear about at a lecture by Ross andJeffery at the Megalithomania Conference in Connecticut in October 2011. Theyshowed Archimedean, Euclidian, and Pythagorean geometric principles embedded inSerpent Mound and the earthworks of the Ohio Valley. Ross has written severalbooks about Serpent Mound including Star Mounds: Legacy of a Native AmericanMystery, where he makes the case that a massive terrestrial zodiac once existedon the ground with the great serpent as the middle of it. A similar zodiac isthought to exist around the legendary Glastonbury in England: “Viewing it as though it were in the sky as a centerpiece of a living solarsystem, we may begin to grasp the nearly superhuman effort put into the planningand execution of the stunning organization of temple-like structures surroundingit, spanning no less than three states including Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.”5ohio-zodiac-ross.png [../Images/image00370.jpeg] Jeffrey Wilson has been analyzing LIDAR surveys of the Ohio landscape and it hashelped him discover many secrets invisible to satellite photography. Mostnotably, were the ‘plumes’ or feathers that are on either side of the Serpent’sneck.Just prior to 1891, Professor Putnam opened one of the burial mounds on theproperty of the Great Serpent Mound. This account describes an Adena male, sixfeet in length: “Several peculiarities of this skeleton are worthy of notice. It was that of awell-developed man…and probably about 25 or 30 years of age, he never had anywisdom teeth, and a search in the maxillary bone of one side showed that therewas no wisdom tooth forming in the jaw. With this exception, he had a fine setof teeth, and still embedded in the premaxillary bone is a partly formed leftincisor tooth. No corresponding formation can be seen on the opposite side ofthe suture, and this is probably a super-numerary tooth, although the small sizeof the lateral incisors is suggestive of their being persistent first teeth. Asis often the case in skulls of this race, the crowns of the incisors aredistinctly folded.” 6 This indicates that a second-row of teeth could have been forming when he died,suggesting he was an adolescent and may have grown much taller.7 Very close bythis mound burial was another burial apparently of greater antiquity than theAdena era, more typical of an archaic period trench interment: “The grave had been, all unwittingly, partly over an ancient grave of particularinterest. This older grave had been made about five feet deep in the clay, andwas about nine feet long and five wide. A pavement of flat stones was placedover the bottom, and on them, at the south side...were the fragments of askeleton. The pieces of skull found at the southeastern corner of the grave weretwice the usual thickness.”8 Putnam, perhaps fearing professional criticism, never openly writes of very tallskeletal remains, although he apparently unearthed them as shown in this oldpostcard. Since Frederic Ward Putnam did all the known excavation work atSerpent Mound, it is assumed this is one of his exhumations. It clearly statesit was from Serpent Mound on the postcard, but there is still debate as to wherethis photo of a 7 ft skeleton was actually taken. Notice that the legs are cutoff at the knee’s, so is “7 ft” what we actually see, or is it an estimation ifhe had his lower legs and feet attached?If this was not taken at Serpent Mound, where was it taken? Was it perhaps theone in this following account?7ft-serpent-mound-skeleton-postcard.bmp [../Images/image00371.jpeg] Giants of Other Days:Recent Discoveries near Serpent Mound, OhioNew York Times. March 5, 1894 “From the Indianapolis Journal. Farmer Warren Cowen of Hilsborough, Ohio, whilefox hunting recently discovered several ancient graves. They were situated upona high point of land in Highland County, Ohio, about a mile from the famousSerpent Mound, where Prof. Putnam of Harvard made interesting discoveries. Assoon as the weather permitted, Cowen excavated several of these graves. Thegraves were made of large limestone slabs, two and a half to three feet inlength and a foot wide. These were set on edge about a foot apart. Similar slabscovered the graves. A single one somewhat larger was at the head and another atthe foot. The top of the grave was two feet below the present surface.Upon opening one of the graves a skeleton of upwards of six feet was brought tolight. There were a number of stone hatchets, beads, and ornaments of peculiarworkmanship near the right arm. Several large flint spear and arrow heads amongthe ribs gave evidence that the warrior had died in battle.In another grave was the skeleton of a man equally large... Several pipes andpendants were near the shoulders. In other graves, Cowen made equallyinteresting finds. It seems that the region was populated by a fairlyintelligent people, and that the serpent mound was an object of worship. Nearthe graves is a large field in which broken implements, fragments of pottery,and burned stones give evidence of a prehistoric village.” Newark & Chillicothe Earthworks, Ohio The Newark Earthworks in Newark and Heath, Ohio, consists of three sections ofpreserved earthworks: the Great Circle Earthworks, the Octagon Earthworks, andthe Wright Earthworks. The largest and most impressive earthworks in NorthAmerica, this complex contained the largest earthen enclosures in the world,being about 3,000 acres in extent. The Newark Site still exists and ismaintained as part of a golf course. The circle is 20 acres with 8-foot highwalls and a 5-foot moat, the Octagon is an amazing 50 acres. Dr. Ray Hively andDr. Robert Horn from Earlham College discovered lunar alignments at the sitewhile researching it in the 1980s.9 The Newark circle and octagon is aligned tolunar standstills, it measures aspects the 18.61 year metonic cycle of the moon,is considered twice as accurate as the astronomical measurements of Stonehenge,and predicts eclipses.The Newark site was once believed to be connected to a sister site inChillicothe, Ohio. The Great Hopewell Road was 60 miles long and headed southwest. However this is disputed due to new studies carried out by twoarchaeologists, who LIDAR scanned the entire area.10 However, there was once asix-mile stretch of earthwork banks projecting from Newark in the samedirection, which probably confused the theory.newark-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00372.jpeg]Newark_Works_Squier_and_Davis_Plate_XXV.jpg [../Images/image00373.jpeg]Above: Newark Works by Squier and Davis. Below: View of the main Newark circle.This site also measured the metonic cycle, predicted eclipses and measured thesuns setting and rising points at the solstices. Researcher Joseph Knapp hasdetermined that Chillicothe was utilized for lunar observations between Januarythrough June each year because the Newark horizons blocked the best views of themoon. However in July through December, Newark’s circle and octagon offered thebest place to view the movements of the moon. Hively and Horn estimated that ittook over 100 years or careful observation prior to constructing the earthworks.This research has revealed that the prehistoric cultures in the area hadadvanced scientific understanding as the basis of their complex construction.Hugh visited both these sites in September 2012 and was impressed by theprecision shaping of the earthworks, the accuracy of the circles, and the sheerimmensity of some of the henges and ditches. The second circle at Newarkresembles Avebury in England with a similar bank and ditch system, and like thegreat stone circles of Britain, feels like it was designed to be there foreternity. Although no giants have been reported from these particularearthworks, strikingly similar earthworks near Chillicothe have yielded someskeletons of rather tall stature, discovered (again) by Dr. Warren K. Morehead: A skeleton in ArmorWichita Daily Eagle, November 17, 1891, pg.2Chillicothe, Ohio “Dr. Warren Morehead and Dr. Cresson have opened up the most interestingprehistoric relic yet discovered in America on a farm seven miles west of here.They exhumed the massive skeleton of a man encased in copper armor from a longmound. The mouth contained pearls of large size but much decayed. At the side ofthe skeleton was another skeleton supposed to be that of a woman. Thediscoverers think they have found the king and queen of the Mound Builders.” Further gigantic skeletons were reportedly uncovered in the vicinity of thegeometric Liberty Earthworks, a few miles southeast of Chillicothe. An accountof the unearthing of three unusually tall skeletons is given: Americans Seven FeetThe Daily Newburgh Journal, October 26, 1898, pg.1Liberty Earthworks, Southeast of Chillicothe “There have been unearthed at Chillicothe, Ohio, three monster skeletons. Theywere found in the neighborhood of what was at one time one of the most importantearthworks of the mound builders. The skeletons, which were those of men overseven feet in height, were found in various postures and it is supposed theyfell either defending or attacking the earthworks and were buried with militaryhonors.”chillocothe-wider-map.gif [../Images/image00374.gif] Miamisburg MoundMontgomery County, Ohio Miamisburg Mound is believed to have been built by the Adena Culture, anywherebetween 1000 to 200 BC. It served as an ancient burial site, and has becomeperhaps the most recognizable historic landmark in the area. It is the largestconical burial mound in Ohio, once nearly 70 feet tall (the height of aseven-story building) and 877 feet in circumference; it remains virtually intactfrom its construction perhaps 2500 years ago. Excavations conducted in 1869revealed details of construction suggesting the Adena culture built the mound inseveral stages. The excavators found a layer of flat stones, overlapping likeshingles on a roof, at a depth of 24 feet below the surface.Miamisburg%20-old-pic-Montgomery%20County.jpg [../Images/image00375.jpeg] The mound also once had a stone facing. Monuments like Miamisburg Mound may havebeen used as cemeteries for several generations, and also marked the boundariesof tribal territories.11 The stone facing must have been extremely impressivebut many of these ancient structures were pirated for building materials bysettlers.Hugh visited Miamisburg in September 2012 to take a look for himself. On ahunch, he drove to the local town before visiting the mound site and discoveredthat the local Historical Society was open that day. With his partner Sheena,they got talking with the members who were present that day, and Hugh had thehonor of being the first Englishman to grace their office! They enquired aboutthe mounds in the area and found out that the entire town was once a greatearthwork site that was once part of a greater mound complex that covered manysquare miles. Hugh was shown old records and local histories, before getting onto the controversial subject of unusual skeletons.miamisburg-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00376.jpeg] Most of the Historical Society members had heard about the giants, and one ofthem ran off into another room and dug out a green photocopied booklet that hada full account of the excavations, titled Brief Historical Background ofMiamisburg Indian Mound. Strangely, the booklet was produced by Monsanto, thegenetic engineering giants, who were involved in nuclear weapons research duringthe second world war. The ‘Mound Laboratory’ was completed in 1948 and the sitechosen “because of the major Indian Mound which is adjacent to the Plant site.”Hugh purchased a copy for $3.00.During the Second World War the plant made plutonium detonators for nuclearweapons, carrying out work that was “very classified.” The plant had a smallarmy of security guards and was surrounded by chain fencing and razor wire. Whenthe Cold War ended, the plant discontinued the detonator work, but it continuedto make nuclear power generators for space probes.12 Beginning in 1960, thefacility released radioactive tritium into the air and contaminated the soilwith plutonium-238, which is said to have triggered the higher-than-averagecases of cancer in the local community, with an estimated 90% of householdscontracting some type of cancer from the 1960s onwards.13 It was not until 1993that a ‘clean-up’ was carried out, but obviously this was too late for many ofthe locals.Miamisburg-booklet-cover-BW.jpg [../Images/image00377.jpeg]The $3.00 booklet from 1975.So back in May 1975 the Explosives Safety Engineering Conference, organized byMonsanto Research Corporation was taking place and the Brief HistoricalBackground of Miamisburg Indian Mound document was handed out to the attendees.The lengthy account it contains is from The Miamisburg News from April 29th1920, covering the full history of what happened at the site from the early1800s to the 1869 excavation. This following segments are from the booklet: “In the year 1814 or 1815, Jacob Gebhart commenced tunneling upon the northeastside of the Mound, at a point between the base and the top, nearly midway.”Interestingly it continues, “ashes and charred remains of wood were discovered,a hollow sound peculiar to all artificial structures of this character, whichfollowed the stroke of the pick, frightened the inquisitive explorer, and heabandoned his scheme.” It was not until 1839 that another attempt at excavating the mound took place.Ross Hamilton had previously visited the local library and uncovered theoriginal entry describing what happened: The Historical Collections of OhioR977.1-H83, Miamisburg Public Library, 1848 “Regarding the great Miamisburg Mound, in 1839 a man named Lewis receivedpermission from the owner of the work, Dr. John Treon to excavate. Digging intothe top of it, he uncovered a few bones at about 10 or 12 feet from the surfacewhen he became frightened by a hollow sound off his pick. He stopped the workthere, but the bones were preserved by Dr. Treon, and were of enormous size, ajaw [bone] slipping easily over those of the largest man, flesh and all.” The booklet goes on to describes how the local landscape had an artificial lakethat stayed full all year round; a forest had been cleared, and that the mound“was originally composed of sun-dried brick, made of clay taken from theexcavation which formed this pond.” Further evidence of giants were alsouncovered: “A pioneer relates that whilst plowing in a field adjoining it, many years ago,he discovered a grave of extraordinary size, which proved by actual measurementto be not less than ten feet in length. Upon one occasion, after a heavy stormhad swept over the vicinity, a massive oak tree was up-rooted and from its bedcame up a gigantic skeleton complete. Owing to some neglect, however, it was notpreserved.” The article emphasises that the bones and relics discovered within the mound andsurrounding area had a “remarkable state of preservation.” The articlecontinues: “The vicinity abounds with evidence of the existence of a mammoth race, skilledin the art of war and much further advanced in civilization than any of theIndian tribes of which we have authentic knowledge.” Described are numerous artistically fashioned artifacts such as pipes, poundersand war axes that are “so ponderous that none but giant arms could have wieldedthem.”In July 1839 a group of local citizens was formed to explore the mound in aprofessional manner. A weekly report was published in the Miamisburg Bulletin,until a lack of funds brought the work to an end. However it was such big newsthat a local reporter was invited to the excavations, so the story got out tovarious newspapers.Jim uncovered this further account that summarises the story of what wasdiscovered. The day they opened the Miamisburg MoundDayton Daily News, February 23, 1932 “At a distance of eight feet below the surface and directly west of the line ofexcavation the workmen came upon a human skeleton, entombed in a sitting postureand facing due east....Wood, stone, charcoal and ashes were unearthed andcarefully preserved with the human bones, which were of unusual size.” Once again it is mentioned that the skeleton was buried in a sitting posturefacing east like so many other accounts. Frustratingly this is one of hundredsand hundreds of these accounts, that you essentially have to throw out as aresearcher because they don’t give exact measurements. It is obvious to anyonehowever, that if you are saying unusual size and greatly exceeding normal heightyou are talking about very, very large bones.Thankfully, we have an accurate account a half-a-mile down the road fromMiamisburg that was first recorded on December 23rd 1898, and published onChristmas Day in The Courier-Journal, Louisville, with the headline: Skeleton ofGiant That Antedates Adam. Further newspapers altered the headline, but repeatedthe same discoveries. It was reported in multiple other sources as well,including this thorough one, that included illustrations of the skeleton andskull:Miamisburg%20-headline.jpg [../Images/image00378.jpeg]The Middletown Signal, January 17, 1899 “The skeleton of a giant found near Miamisburg is the cause of much discussionnot only among the curious and illiterate but among the learned scientists ofthe world. The body of a man more gigantic than any ever recorded in humanhistory, has been found in the Miami Valley, in Ohio. The skeleton it iscalculated must have belonged to a man 8 feet 1 ½ inches in height. It was foundwithin a half mile of Miamisburg in a locality which contains many relics of themound builders. Edward Gobhart and Edward Kauffman discovered it while they wereworking in a gravel pit. Kauffman struck a hard substance with his pick andexamining it found it to be a skull. When they unearthed the whole skeleton andrealized its size they were aghast. The skeleton is of prehistoric age, beingfossilized, Its giant proportions present a puzzling problem to thearchaeologists. The old theory of tradition that there were giants in early daysof the earth has long been discredited. It is a fact, generally agreed, thatprehistoric men were little, dark, monkey-like, hairy creatures, considerablysmaller than those of the present day. The prehistoric giant seems evidence ofthe opposite state of affairs. He is clearly a man and a very well proportionedone as to his limbs. The prehistoric giant must have had a head not differinggreatly from a gorilla. In stature, he was far bigger and also better formed…Thejawbones are intact and show that their possessor was patterned in the mostpowerful fashion. The teeth are models of strength and beauty of form.Miamisburg-skull.jpg [../Images/image00379.jpeg] Dr. Harlan, a dentist, of Miamisburg, examined the teeth and declared them to beas fine a specimen as he had ever seen. Other doctors have also examined theteeth and the skeleton. The body was not the only relic of interest to thoseengaged in scientific research found in the pit. A small flat stone about threeinches long and two inches wide was discovered in the opening. It lay within afew inches of the skull of the prehistoric man, as the local examiners insistthe find should be termed. Through one end of the stone had been drilled a smallhole, possibly intended to be used as an opening for the fitting in of a handle.It is pointed out by those who have had their theory of the species of thediscovery questioned that the stone, so evidently the work of human hands,clearly indicates that the skeleton was that of a man and not of a mammothmonkey. The bones have been placed on exhibition and many are the curious sightseers who have passed in wonder before them. It is claimed by residents of theMiami valley that a prehistoric race once inhabited the region and erected thelargest mound in the country.”Miamisburg-skeleton.jpg [../Images/image00380.jpeg] Once again the jaws were massive, the teeth perfect, and the skull showed manyanatomic anomalies. None other than Professor Thomas Wilson, the Curator ofAnthropology for the Smithsonian, said the following about the find: “The authenticity of the skull is beyond any doubt. It’s antiquityunquestionably great, to my own personal knowledge several such crania werediscovered in the Hopewell group of mounds in Ohio, exhibiting very monkey-liketraits. The jaws were prognathus (projecting beyond the face) and the facialindex remarkably low. With these remains we found thousands of objectsillustrating the extent of prehistoric commerce in this country; shells from thesouthern Atlantic coasts, mica from Virginia, copper from Lake Superior andvolcanic glass from the Rocky Mountains.”The article then lists “authenticated giants” of modern times and puts thisgiant skeleton on the list.Miamisburg Mound is located in a strange landscape. The town is recovering fromnuclear leaks that caused much harm to many of the local residents. However, itis supposed to be fairly safe for a quick visit, and is one of the mostimpressive mound sites in North America. Grave Creek MoundMoundsville, West Virginia Grave Creek Mound, like Miamisburg, is very similar to Silbury Hill inWiltshire, England and is officially the largest conical mound in America. It islocated in Moundsville, West Virginia, and the nearby Kanawha Valley hashundreds of similar earthworks to explore.grave_creek_etching.jpg [../Images/image00381.jpeg] In early September 2012, Hugh and Sheena drove to the border of West Virginiathrough Wheeling. As they approached Moundsville, it suddenly started rainingheavily and a lightning storm erupted right over the town. Hugh felt it was somekind of warning, or even a strange welcome to the land of the giants! After anights sleep at the Wheeling Motel, they drove through the backstreets ofMoundsville and discovered a monolith lying recumbent on the side of the roadthat may have once been part of this greater ancient complex.grave-creek-stone.bmp [../Images/image00382.jpeg] Grave Creek Mound is the largest conical mound in North America, with a famoushaunted prison directly behind it. The mound is 70 feet tall with a diameter of295 ft, weighing in at 60,000 tons, and was part of a wider complex of mounds,octagonal earthworks, and stone towers up on the bluffs overlooking the river.This would have been a clear warning for those entering this territory by boator land.The mound once had a moat or henge around it, that would have made it look a lotlike Silbury Hill. The first excavation took place in 1838, that yielded twoskeletons, the female wearing copper arm rings, and buried with variousornaments including the tiny Grave Creek Tablet.Strange energies, ghostly sightings, men in black, and even Mothman typehauntings have been reported around the mound, with a prison built right next toit that has become a paranormal hotspot.

A notable example is the ‘shadow man’, who wasspotted and photographed by several people, who even responded to humaninteraction.14Grave-Creek-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00383.jpeg]Hugh felt as sense of that power on the night he arrived, when he was surroundedby a sudden onset of lightning and thunder, an often occurring phenomenon wheninvestigating the graves of giants. Skeletons in MoundCharleston Daily Mail, October 22, 1922 Here we have the most well-known report about the giants of Grave Creek Mound,discussing the female skeleton 7 ft 4 inches tall, and a male 8 ft tall, plusthe mention of the jawbone fitting over the face of a local resident. However,this was 84 years after the original discovery: “Archaeologists investigating the mound some years ago dug out a skeleton saidto be that of a female because of the formation of the bones. The skeleton wasseven feet four inches tall and the jawbone would easily fit over the face of aman weighing 160 pounds. Seventeen hundred ivory beads, 500 seashells of aninvolute species and five copper bracelets were found in the vault. The beadsand shells were about the neck and breast of the skeleton while the braceletswere upon the arms. There was also taken from the mound the skeleton of a maneight feet tall. There were no ornaments beside it. These skeletons were sent tothe Smithsonian Institution in Washington.” This next article was published 64 years after the initial discovery The Hawaiian Star February 13, 1902, pg.6 “When the excavations were made three skeletons were found directly in thecenter but raised a view feet from the level of the surrounding land. One of theskeletons had belonged to a male human being about eight feet high, one a femaleand one a child. There was also in the rude chamber a tablet of stone, upon oneside of which were hieroglyphics, which is now in the Smithsonian Institution atWashington.”moundsville-editor-letter.jpg [../Images/image00384.jpeg] Unfortunately there is no sign of any skeletons any more as it states theSmithsonian got involved. But did they really? As we dug deeper into therecords, an earlier description of the discoveries emerged in a letter to theeditor of a newspaper. This was only 40 years after the initial discoveries (seeon right).The first reported incident of finding taller than average skeletons was putforward by Peter B. Catlett, who lived in Moundsville and said he was present atthe excavation in 1838. It was on 6th May 1876 when he was answering queriesfrom P.P. Cherry about the Grave Creek Tablet. He said: “....the engraved stone was found in the inside of a stone arch that was foundin the middle of the mound, and in that stone arch was found a skeleton thatmeasured seven feet and four inches. When the bones were placed upon wires, Itook the lower jawbone and put it over my chin and it did not touch myface...”15 This was 38 years after the initial discovery, but the 1922 account seems to beusing this as its basis, only that one has an 8 ft skeleton added to thedescription.Andrew Collins carried out some research into the claims that actual giants werediscovered and sent Hugh this following matter-of-fact account from when themound was first excavated by A.B. Tomlinson’s grandfather. Here are somehighlights from the lengthy letter: “Prompted by curiosity or some other cause, on the 19th of March, 1838, wecommenced an excavation in this mound.... At the distance of one hundred andeleven feet we came to a vault that had been excavated in the natural earthbefore the mound was commenced.... In the upper vault was found one skeletononly, but many trinkets, as seventeen hundred ivory beads, five hundred seashells of the involute species, that were worn as beads, and five copperbracelets that were about the wrist bones of the skeleton. There were also onehundred and fifty pieces of isinglass (mica)... The skeleton first found in thelower vault, was found lying on the back, parallel with and close to the westside of the vault. The feet were about the middle of the vault; its body wasextended at full length; the left arm was lying along the left side; the rightarm as if raised over the head, the bones lying near the right ear and crossedover the crown of the head. The head of this skeleton was toward the south.There were no ornaments found with it. The earth had fallen and covered it overbefore the ceiling fell, and thus protected it was not much broken. We have itpreserved from the inspection of visitors; it is five feet nine inches high; andhas a full and perfect set of teeth in a good state of preservation; the head isof a fine intellectual mould; whether male or female cannot be ascertained, asthe pelvis was broken.” He concluded with this matter-of-fact statement: “There is nothing in the remains of any of these skeletons which differsmaterially from those of common people.”Mdsville%20stone%20tower%20(2).bmp [../Images/image00385.jpeg]Stone tower up on the bluffs above the river in Moundsville.

One that isof normal height, and another at 7 ft 4 inches. We have put all the evidence wecan find in this investigation, but are at a loss to reach any final conclusion,although the sheer amount of giant skeletons discovered in mounds in this areadoes strengthen the argument for at least one giant skeleton being discovered inthe enigmatic Grave Creek Mound. 176 miles southwest of Moundsville, an 8 ftskeleton was reported with similar grave goods to Grave Creek that we alsoexamine in the Curious Artifacts chapter. Are Bones of Giants:Moundbuilders had Peculiar HeadsThe Afro American, December 5, 1908, pg.2Friendly, West Virginia This report surfaced later in 1908 describing a mound in Friendly, WestVirginia, which is around 56 miles southwest of Moundsville on the way to theMarietta earthworks. “Prof. E. L. Lively and J. L. Williamson, of Friendly, have made anexamination of the giant skeletons found by children playing near that town. Thefemur and vertebrae were found to be in a remarkable state of preservation andshowed the persons to be of enormous stature. The skeletons ranged in heightfrom 7 feet 6 inches down to 6 feet 7 inches. The skulls found are of peculiarformation. The forehead is low and slopes back gradually, while the back part ofthe head is very prominent, much more so than the skulls of people living at thepresent day. The legs are exceedingly long and the bones unusually large. Thefinding of the skeletons has created a great deal of interest and the generalimpression is that the bones are the remains of the people who built the mounds,the largest in the country being located at Moundsville, Marshall County.” Friendly residents Lively and Williamson were both real people and respectedmembers of their community. J. L. Williamson held the office of Member of theBoard of Education and the County Board of Review. The unusual nature of theskulls is discussed, as is frequently the case in these reports. West Virginiacertainly has quite a few giant skeleton reports, and although the legendarygiant discoveries from Grave Creek Mound were not quite what any buddinggiantologist would hope for, the local area was certainly a hub oftaller-than-average Mound Builders. The similarity of the reports may have mixedthings up over the years, especially if the geography of the area is not fullycomprehended and understood. Further discoveries were made in this part of WestVirginia, including this account from Dr. Donald Dragoo. Cresap MoundThe Work of Donald Dragoo, 1959Northern West Virginia In 1959, Dr. Donald Dragoo, the curator for the Section of Man at the CarnegieMuseum unearthed a 7 feet 2 inch skeleton during the complete excavation(obliteration) of the Cresap Mound in Northern West Virginia, 6.5 miles south ofGrave Creek Mound. Dragoo classified the massive jawbone he found there as the“Adena Jaw” and reported the following: “In all respects the Cresap Mound skeletal material conforms to the physicaltype of the Kentucky and Ohio Adena mounds previously described by Snow.” 16 The physical type of material Dragoo refers to are massive jawbones, unusuallythick skulls, robust and massive frames indicating profound muscularity: “This individual was of large proportions. When measured in the tomb his lengthwas approximately 7.04 feet. All of the long bones were heavy and possessedmarked eminences for the attachment of muscles.” 17 Dragoo published a photo of the actual skeleton in his book so there is no doubtit was authentic. Dragoo joins many other university-trained anthropologists andarchaeologists who discovered over seven-foot skeletons in burial mounds, oftenwith anatomical anomalies.dragoo-cresap-mound-skeleton.bmp [../Images/image00388.jpeg]7.04 ft skeleton discovered in Cresap Mound.The top part of the skeleton was burnt.dragoo-cresap-mound-plan.bmp [../Images/image00389.jpeg]Ground Plan of Cresap Mound showing Clay floor level and below.

Marietta EarthworksThe Fostoria Review-Dispatch, July 25th, 1901, pg.2Marietta, Washington County, Ohio Marietta is a beautiful town that was built over a geometric mound complex thathad great ‘squares’ and ‘circles’, now hidden within the foundations of thetown. Said to be a Hopewell site (c.100 BC) and located at the confluence of theMuskingum and Ohio rivers, it consists of flat-topped ‘cross’ mounds, similar tostep pyramids in Mexico. One of them now acts as the foundations of a library.The greater squares are at most 1500 ft wide.In the modern graveyard are the remains of a mound that appears to be theaxis-mundi of the complex. It has a deep henge around it showing a subtle andsophisticated side to the Mound Builders of the area.marietta-mound-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00391.jpeg] Image: The mound in the cemetary at Marietta.Around the town are numerous banks and earthworks that are the last remnants ofthis site. It was here that Ross Hamilton, in Star Mounds: Legacy of a NativeAmerican Mystery, noted that the constellation Centaurus had half of its starsoverlay the entire site, much like Orion mirrors the three pyramids of Giza,Egypt (as discovered by Robert Bauval).In 1901, a very tall skeleton was discovered within the earthworks: “Workmen, while engaged in excavating on upper Fourth Street, Marietta,unearthed what seems to be the remains of a prehistoric age. The bones, whichare remarkably well preserved, are of abnormal size, and, as close as can bereckoned, the individual in question must have been measured at least seven feetin height. Experts are of the opinion that he belonged to a tribe of MoundBuilders, whose earthen works appear at Marietta in a number of places.”marietta-squier-davis.jpg [../Images/image00392.jpeg]Squier and Davissurvey of theMarietta earthworks. Beehive Stone MoundsThe Smithsonian Institution Bureau of Ethnology Report, 1890-91Patterson, North Carolina The Beehive Stone Mounds found in this tumulus are remarkably similar to stonecairns found up and down the east coast of New England. In this case, however,there just happened to be a “not less than 7 feet high” skeleton found in themound: “...located on the farm of Rev. T.F. Nelson, in the northwest part of thecounty, and about a mile and a half southeast of Patterson. It stood on thebottom land of the Yadkin, about 100 yards from the river, and was almost a truecircle in outline, 38 feet in diameter, but not exceeding at any point 18 inchesin height.The thorough excavation made, in which Mr. Rogan, the Bureau agent,was assisted by Dr. J.M. Spainhour, of Lenoir, showed that the originalconstructers had first dug a circular pit about 38 feet in diameter to the depthof 3 feet and there placed the dead, some in stone cist and others unenclosed,and afterwards covered them over, raising a slight mound above the pit. A planof the pit, showing the stone graves and skeletonsstone-mound-tf-nelson-mound.jpg [../Images/image00393.jpeg]as they appeared after the removal of the dirt and before being disturbed, isgiven in figure. 207......No. 16 was unenclosed “squatter” of unusually largesize, not less than 7 feet high when living.” Moundville, AlabamaThe Tuscaloosa News, February 23, 1930Moundville, Alabama Here we are informed of the unearthing of artifacts and skeletons from thefamous Moundville Mississippian site in Alabama (not to be confused withMoundsville, West Virginia). Moundville was the location of a sophisticated andthriving culture from 1000 AD until 1450 AD. Dr. Walter B. Jones, who led theexcavation announced from his office that one of the skeletons was 7 ft 6inches, with many others well over 6 feet tall. Jim called the museum thathouses the skeletal remains and when he asked about the giant skeleton he wastold by the curator, “...well, except it didn’t happen.”Jim explained that Dr. Jones made this announcement, who in 1930 was joined bycurator William L. Halton, Assistant curator David de Jarnette, and TopographerCarl T Jones all from the Alabama Museum of Natural History in the excavation.Jim asked how could it be that all these men could sign off on such anoutrageous claim. He was then told that there was a persistent mythology in theearlier part of the century and this surely was the reason for this account. Jimthen asked but how could the highly competent and respected Dr. Jonesincorrectly measure and report such a finding, and was once again reassured thatsomeone from Princeton has studied the remains and there were no giants.Jim then pointed to the next account from the Tuscaloosa News in 1976, thatreports that Dr. Jones was made an honorary citizen of Moundville. An awkwardsilence ensued and the conversation came to an abrupt end. Anyway, by the end ofhis career Dr. Jones was made Director Emeritus of the University of AlabamaMuseum of Natural History. “Jones’ early discoveries uncovered facts about Indian settlements of WestAlabama before recorded history, A race which he says were giant people from 6and a half to 7 feet tall. It was Jones and Jones alone who realized thesignificance of the discoveries at first.”Moundville-postcard-BW.bmp [../Images/image00394.jpeg] Moundvilleby John H. Blitz, 2008, pg.8 In this modern guidebook to the site, an account is given of Sheriff Hezekiah K.Powell unearthing a nine ft skeleton from the mounds in Carthage, Alabama. Weare told that the skeleton eventually made its way to the SmithsonianInstitution. Blitz states that: “Powell finding a giant was not exceptional. People were digging up giants allacross rural America, in keeping with the scriptural wisdom that ‘There weregiants in the earth in those days.’” Although Blitz wrote an entire book on Moundville, he never mentioned that Dr.Walter B.

The highest part,which contained the ‘great mortuary’ was 33 ft high and the full length of thequad-mound was 350 ft long. It was originally excavated in 1933, when commercialdiggers calling themselves the Pocola Mining Company acquired the lease for theto ‘dig’. From 1933 until 1935 Pocola employees dug haphazardly into the burialmound.spiromound-tunnels.tif [../Images/image00396.jpeg]Excavation in the summer of 1935. From left to right: John Hobbs, unknownworker, W. Guinn Cooper and Billy Vandagriff. Photo from the collection of Dr.Robert E. Bell, from The Spiro Mound: A Photo Essay by Larry and ChristopherMerriam. They destroyed about one-third of the mound and sold thousands of artifacts madeof stone, copper, shell, basketry, and fabric to collectors throughout theworld. Dubbed the “King Tut of the Arkansas Valley” by the Kansas City Star in1935, the site yielded artifacts in greater numbers, in better preservation, andshowing more elaborate artistic, sophisticated decoration than any otherMississippian site. Continuing destruction convinced the Oklahoma Legislature topass a licensing requirement for the protection of the site, and in November1935 the Pocola Mining Company finally closed the site down when their lease ranout. Below is a matter-of-fact report of what was going on there at the time: The Herald Journal, August 26, 1934 pg 2 “Indian relics estimated to be from 600 to 2000 years old and including thethighbone of a giant brave are being taken in large numbers from a burial mound4 ½ miles from here. The Pocola Mining Company, composed of six Arkansas andOklahoma men, is in charge of excavations, begun last February. Although it is aprivate enterprise, each item taken from the mound is catalogued andphotographed and careful records are being kept of the disposition of theartifacts, human bones, beads of wood and stone, pearls and large conch shells.Situated in the middle of a field near the Arkansas River, the mound isapproximately 100 feet long and 40 feet high at the peak. It is of sand, makingdigging comparatively easy. Excavations about 20 feet deep have been made. Amongthe treasured finds is a large femur, indicating its owner must have been aboutnine feet tall. Bones and skeletons of other human beings are of normal size.” This next extract is from the book The Spiro Mound: A photo essay-photographs from the collection of Dr. Robert E. Bell.18 It was written down byW. Guinn Cooper of the Pocola Mining Company around 1936. Here it relates howthey found one large skeleton at the site: “He was better than seven feet tall. His jaw would fit around my face...He wasmore or less in pieces, we had to put him together, you see. He was bound to bea giant. He said they did not dig in the level area around the mound. ‘We’d justdig in the mound. We had our hands full there’. He said they didn’t make anymoney out of the venture. ‘No, we didn’t, we were fighting to live. This wasback in the great Hoover starvation period. The worst part of it and we werefighting to live.’” Once again, the jaw bone was reported to be so large that the finder could slipit over their face. This next remarkable discovery was analysed by Ross Hamiltonwhilst researching A Tradition of Giants. We hand over to Ross for this nextsection: Spiro’s Magnificent ManN.A.I.R.C.A. Official Bulletin, 1936, by G.I. Groves and Allen Brown.Commentary from Ross Hamilton The account following is a classic, because the rumor of its subject stayedaround for many years after the fact of the bones‘ disappearance. It wasreported that an eight ft skeleton in full armor had been discovered at Spiro,Oklahoma, and had been rumored taken surreptitiously by the Smithsonian. As itturned out, the skeletal remains were not in full armor, but rather fully armed;and its mummy was simply ignored until someone noticed it was gone. Who, wewonder, snatched it, for what purpose, and where is it now? The author, G.I.Groves says his organization, the North American Indian Relic CollectorsAssociation, is the first to invest in preparation and publication concerningthe discovery and excavation. He claims that the information in the bulletin hadbeen collected from various sources, including personal visits to the Mound, andinterviews with various persons. (He must have talked with the younger membersof the Pocola Mining Co., as he calls them ‘boys.’) The bulletin includes a veryearly photograph of the Craig Mound with trees growing on it, that some describeas three feet in circumference (see pic on earlier page). The bulletin includesa story of one of the bodies found in the Mound which we had never heardanywhere else:spiromound-cutaway.bmp [../Images/image00397.jpeg]Image courtesy Larry and Christopher Merriam from The Spiro Mound: A PhotoEssay. “Of the skeletal material, only four or five good specimens were found. Oneremarkable mummy was 8 ½ feet in length. He had been cremated to such an extentthat the flesh was charred, and remained in that condition throughout the ages.Across the breast of this mighty warrior were seven large bows, three stonepipes, forty war points, and four eight-inch spears. No beads were found on thisbody. At the time of this discovery, little attention has been paid theexcavation of this mound. The mummy was moved into the only tent available. Afew neighbors marveled at the remains, but no museum authorities orarchaeologists were interested enough to investigate. After occupying forseveral weeks the only shelter available, it was moved to the rear of the tentto make room for more valuable relics, and left to the ravages of the elements.In a few weeks, it had disappeared.”spiromound-artifacts-Robert.E.Bell-1936.jpg [../Images/image00398.jpeg]Photo taken December 8, 1935, in J.

Cahokia, Illinois Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is located on the site of an ancient NativeAmerican city (c. 600–1400 CE) situated in southern Illinois between East St.Louis and Collinsville. The park covers 2,200 acres or about 3.5 square miles,and contains about 80 mounds, but the ancient city was actually much larger. Inits heyday, Cahokia covered about 6 square miles and included about 120 man-madeearthen mounds in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and functions. Monks mound isthe largest earthen pyramid ever built in ancient America, standing 100 feethigh it has a base of 14 acres, one acre larger than the great pyramid of Giza.It required 22 million cubic feet of soil brought from over a mile away tocreate the four-stepped pyramid.Cahokia-aerial-view.jpg [../Images/image00399.jpeg] Cahokia-The Great Native American Metropolisby Biloine Whiting Young and Melvin Leo Fowler, 2000, pg.26 The authors describes how in 1891 the Reverend Stephen Peet wrote about hisvisit to Cahokia: “There are also vast quantities of bones hidden beneath the surface and one canscarcely strike a spade through the soil without unearthing some token of theprehistoric races. Mr. Ramey, the owner of the mound, speaks about digging inone part of the field and finding heaps of bones eight feet deep and says thatthe bones are everywhere present. The workmen who were engaged in diggingditches for underdraining had a few days before came upon large quantities ofpottery and skeletons of large size but had carelessly broken them instead ofpreserving them.”Another interesting Cahokia account comes from the Saint Louis Dispatch in 1906. “A Mr. Hill who once lived upon it, while making excavation near the northwestextremity, uncovered human bones and white pottery in considerable quantities.The bones, which instantly crumbled to dust on exposure to the air, appearedlarger than ordinary, while the teeth were double in front as well as behind.” Aztalan, WisconsinNew York Times, August 10, 1891 Aztalan in Wisconsin is the site of an ancient Mississippian culture settlementthat flourished during the 10th to 13th centuries. The indigenous peopleconstructed massive earthwork mounds for religious and political purposes. Theywere part of a widespread culture with important settlements throughout theMississippi River valley and its tributaries. Their trading network extendedfrom the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, and into the southeast of thepresent-day United States.Aztalan-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00400.jpeg]The pyramid-like mound at Aztalan, Wisconsin. Although the relationship is not well-understood as of yet, Aztalan is believedto have been intimately connected to the enormous Mississippian urban center ofCahokia, approximately 310 miles to the south, along the Mississippi river andits tributaries. Some things mentioned in the article were as follows: alarge-sized skeleton being unearthed; at the side of the body was found acuriously carved pipe, in the shape of a human head with peculiar characters cuton the sides. Near the right hand was an axe of banded slate in the form of anancient double-edged battle axe. We also read that another skeleton wasunearthed of a person who must have been a giant in his day. Beneath the handwas an axe, finished with great skill and very nicely polished and grooved,which weighed five pounds. Many implements of copper, consisting of beads,disks, spears, arrows and axes, are found. Some of these appear to have beencast, others are hammered into shape and contain nuggets of silver imbedded inthe sides. All are tempered by some unknown process. The author of the articleends it with a moment of sobering reflection: “While scientific men have long been aware of the existence of these wonderfulworks, nothing has been done in the way of obtaining an accurate description orof obtaining a better knowledge of them. Every year the plow is laying them lowand persons ignorant of their value in the eyes of science are destroying notonly the mounds themselves but also the relics contained in them and in a fewyears they will have disappeared entirely.” There is certainly a case to be made that the Native American Mound Buildingcultures had an unusually tall royal ruling class that were oftentimes buried inthese impressive structures. The authors have run down several accounts to theirsource, but although one or two came to a dead-end, the others are simplymatter-of-fact reports that are getting harder to ignore. The sheer number ofthese accounts, reports from university-trained professionals up and into the1950s, and at least 17 reports of 7-foot and taller skeletons listed inSmithsonian ethnology reports testify to the validity of this theory.moundbuildersmap.bmp [../Images/image00401.jpeg] "},{"pageContent":"5. Giants of New England Continuing on from Jim’s introduction, here is a comprehensive selection ofaccounts from the states of New England that also give some backgroundinformation on the megalithic structures and stonework that have verycontroversial origins. New England is more famous for the unusual stonechambers, thousands of miles of walls, and the occasional stone circle ordolmen. To find so many accounts of giants across its beautiful landscape, goingback deep into prehistory, provides an enchanted glimpse into what was oncethere. As we see in the Early Accounts chapter, New England was a thrivingNative American metropolis, even in to the 1900s.

Cole,1821 pg 239Portsmouth, New Hampshire This very early account from New Hampshire describes “a human skeleton, 7 feetin length” and emphasises the mystery of the double sets of teeth when it says:“...the upper jaw had double teeth all around.” This account is included in fullin the Double Rows of Teeth chapter. Guide to the White Mountains and the Lake of New Hampshire.Tripp and Osgood, 1850, pg. 17Moltonborough, New Hampshire “A skeleton was exhumed in this town (Moltonborough) some 30 years ago, ofalmost fabulous proportions. It was buried in a sandy soil, on the shore of thelake, near the mouth of a small river. It was apparently the skeleton of a mansome seven feet high - the jaw bones passing easily over the face of a largeman.” This account was verified when Jim and Hugh visited the Bellows Falls HistoricalSociety in Rockingham. It was listed in an old booklet called Sites in NewHampshire, and added that “Nearby was a cromlech of smooth gray stones notcommonly found in the area, of dimensions suggesting another giant burial underit” (from the notes of poet John G. Whittier). This is a rare and rathertantalising connection between the stone sites of New England and the giants.

D. Canning has in his possession a broken pipe and a copper tomahawk,which were unearthed, together with the gigantic skeleton of an Indian, by Mr.Horace Burrows and others, a few years since, while repairing the highway in theriver district. The skeleton soon crumbled. The copper tomahawk doubtlessbelonged to a warrior renowned in his day and race, and was probably broughtfrom the region of Lake Superior.” Gleason’s Literary Companion, Vol. 5, 1864Hadley, Massachusetts “An Indian skeleton of immense size was recently discovered three feet underground near Fort River Hadley, Massachusetts. The bones were so far decomposedthat most of them crumbled upon exposure to the air. Some of the doctors thinkthat the Indian was not less than seven feet high and one hundred years old whenhe died.” An Indian Tomb UnearthedThe New York Times, December 21, 1891Saugus, nr. Boston, Massachusetts “An Indian sepulcher has been unearthed on “Fish Marsh”, in Saugus. The tomb wasabout seven feet below the surface and it contained the skeleton of a man ofenormous proportions, which crumbled to dust upon exposure to the air. The bodywas buried in a sitting posture, facing the east. Beside the skeleton were founda pipe, a tomahawk blade an arrowhead, an ax and a cylindrical shaped stone.Near the grave an underground passage has been discovered. Excavations are beingmade for the purpose of exploring the passage. The discoveries were made byworkmen who were excavating for building purposes.”cannon-rock-hugh.bmp [../Images/image00405.jpeg]lynn-dolmenjpg [../Images/image00406.jpeg]Illustration of Phaeton or Cannon Rock, Lynn, Mass. Is this a prehistoricdolmen? And Cannon Rock today from a different angle, with wood and concretesupports. This fascinating account also has a ‘megalithic’ connection, as it is very closeto Cannon Rock, a perched boulder that could also be a prehistoric dolmen.Joseph Henry, a 19th century scientist and the first director of the SmithsonianInstitution, made a visit to what was then called Phaeton Rock in 1859. He wrotein a letter dated August 18th: “It came from Canada and lodged in its present elevated position during what iscalled the drift period and was probably transported through the agency of ice.” However, when looking at the delicately poised position of the thirty ton slabon three smaller stones, leaning precariously over a steep bluff, perhaps ourfriend from Fish Marsh may have been involved, as hundreds of legends in Britainand Europe propose that giants were involved with constructing these type ofdolmens. Today, it is supported by wooden blocks and concrete in car tires. Asimilar, but a larger dolmen resides at North Salem, New York, just outside thelocal fire station. A History of Deerfield By George Sheldon, Volume 1. 1895 pg.78 “One of these skeletons was described to me by Henry Mather who saw it, as beingof monstrous size - the head as big as a peck basket, with double teeth allround” (see Jim’s introduction for full account). Huge JawboneThe New England Magazine, Vol. 16, 1897, pg. 546Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts “The spot where the village of Edgartown stands today was at that time anancient Indian burial ground. In one case, a huge jawbone of a man was dug upout from the ground, larger than that of any man at the present time, so largethat it could be placed against the face of an ordinary man and entirelysurround his jaw.” History of the Town of Middleboro, Mass. Thomas Weston, 1906, pg. 400 “His height must have been at least seven feet and eight inches.” (see Jim’sintroduction and DRT chapter for full account) Martha’s VineyardThe Story of Martha’s Vineyard by Charles Gilbert Hine, p. 136, 1908 “Some 15 years ago the skeleton of an Indian Giant in almost perfectpreservation was dug up in the same locality [Cedar Tree Neck] the bonesindicated a man easily six feet and a half possibly seven feet high. An unusualfeature was a complete double row of teeth on both the upper and lower jaws.”Marthas-vineyard_1801_Carleton_web.bmp [../Images/image00407.jpeg]Above: Carelton’s map of Martha’s Vineyard from 1801.

And on theopposite shore Mr. Smith dug out seven skeletons in a sitting posture, eachabout seven feet in stature. When the Millers Falls trolley road was beingexcavated, north of Lake Pleasant, several skeletons were discovered, indicatingregular burial.” Connecticut History of the Colony of New Haven, 1838, pg.126New Haven, Connecticut, circa 1650 This obscure account was a footnote at the bottom of a page in tiny text in atown history of New Haven. It was not sensational, just another matter-of-factaccount of a giant skeleton being dug up by the new local residents, who hadcome over from England building their properties in the mid 1600s. Daniel wasthe son of Thomas Buckingham, who was one of the first settlers in the area: “The house of Daniel Buckingham, Esq, stands on one side of this burying-ground.In digging the cellar of the house, a number of skeletons were exumed [sic], oneof which was near eight feet in length. They were buried in a horizontalposition, and appeared to have been laid out on a bed of charcoal, and coveredwith the same.” United States Register, by Francis Vincent, 1860, pg.75Hartford, Connecticut “The Skeleton of an Indian, who when alive was over seven feet tall, has beendug up in Hartford. An Earthen jug, some wampum, and glass beads, were foundwith the bones.” History of Norwich, Ct. 1866, pg.535Norwich, Connecticut “In preparing for the foundation of this house, a Gigantic Indian skeleton wasexhumed and many rude stone tools and arrow heads thrown up.” The Grave of a GiantessThe New York Times, May 13th, 1888Norwalk, Connecticut This eccentric account in The New York Times, gives information on a legendarynon-Indian giantess who lived recently in New England: “There is a grave in Pine Island Cemetery that is no less than 10 feet long. Itis that of Mrs. Mary Titus, a widow, who was laid to rest there on Feb. 5, 1769,a little over 119 years ago, in the nintieth year of her age. Tradition has itthat Mrs. Titus was a giantess, which fully explains the enormous length of hergrave. It is situated in a remote corner of the large burying ground, and itsexistence had been almost forgotten. A few days ago it was discovered by somecity people visiting here.” A Petrified Giant Dug UpThe Evening Times (Washington D.C.), September 16, 1897, Pg.4New Haven, Connecticut What they meant by “petrified” is unclear, but it could be a very rare exampleof mummification in the North East of America, or it could simply be a naturalprocess. “Italian Laborers Unearth a Stone Man Eight Feet long. Two Italians, whiledigging yesterday on the premises of Deputy Sheriff Arthur Plumb, near TrumbullChurch, discovered a petrified giant. Before Plumb lived upon the place it wasoccupied by Birdseye Plumb, who died many years ago. He used to tell hischildren of a giant named Christian Peterson, a Swede, who died 150 years ago.When the petrified giant was unearthed the traditions of the old town wererecalled, and Sheriff Plumb says that this stone giant is no doubt the petrifiedremains of Christian Peterson. Sheriff Plumb said he would present the stonefigure to the Fairfield Historical Society.”newhaven-Connecticut-petrified%5b1%5d.bmp [../Images/image00409.jpeg]The story was reported again on September 23rd in The Beaver Herald. Skeleton of Giant:Farmer Uncovers Relics of Old CityThe Evening News, Jan 3, 1901Shideler, nr. Hartford, Connecticut “An entire skeleton of an Indian giant has been dug up, together with many otherhuman bones, curious copper and stone implements and crude ornaments. The thighbone of the giant’s skeleton is twice as large as that of an ordinary man.” The relics were found buried under 20 feet of gravel. It is also reported thatpeople in large numbers were flocking to the scene of the discovery. Some of thefirst accounts of giant skeletons Jim uncovered were on the Connecticut River:Gill, Northfield, Deerfield, Hadley, and Montague, Massachusetts, suggestingthey lived by this waterway for many thousands of years.1901-Hartford-CT-jan31st.jpg [../Images/image00410.jpeg] Yale Professors Take Charge of SkeletonsThe Providence News, May 13, 1904Shelton, Connecticut This skeleton was sent to the prestigious Peabody Museum in New Haven,Connecticut. “Dr. H. B. Ferris, professor of Anatomy, Dr. George McCurdy, professor ofanthropology and T. A. Bostwick, in charge of the Peabody museum, all of Yale,have been here and boxed up the skeletons of Indians found in an excavation in amill yard recently. One of the skeletons is that of a man six feet 8 inchestall. It will be articulated if possible.” Further skeletons were also discovered including “those of a man and woman witharms interlocked as if they had been buried in close embrace.” The femaleskeleton also wore a necklace of an unrecognisable metal. What eventuallyhappened to these skeletons is unknown, but considering the infamous Skull andBones Society is based in this college, one has to wonder. Rhode Island Eight Foot GiantBurrillville: as it was, and it is, by H.A. Keach, 1856Burrillville, Rhode Island “In 1836, Capt. Samuel White, in excavating beneath his wood house, found theremains of a human skeleton of proportions altogether unlike our moderninhabitants. He called several of his neighbors to view it, and among them wasDoct. Levi Eddy. The body was lying upon the side, with arms folded, head bentforward, and the knees drawn upward. It was exhumed, the bones were puttogether, and all parties were surprised at its gigantic height. After surveyingit awhile the Doctor exclaimed, ‘He was a bouncer! he must have been as much aseight feet high.’” Indians Were Very TallA History of Gloucester, Rhode Island by Elizabeth Perry, 1886Gloucester, Rhode Island This is another account of a skeleton of enormous size found in the area of theNipmunck and Narragansett tribes (although this could be the same as the aboveaccount as these town are very close to each other). “Some vestiges of these tribes still remain..a human skeleton was found severalfeet below the surface of the ground. When the bones were put together itmeasured eight feet. Some of these Indians were very tall.” Vermont History of the Town of Rockingham by Lyman Simpson Hayes, pg. 338Bellows Falls, Rockingham, Vermont, 1907 “...a remarkable human skeleton, unmistakably that of an Indian, was found.”(see Jim’s introduction for full account) Maine Monmouth Giant Seven and a Half Foot SkeletonHistory of Monmouth and Wales, Maine, Harry H. Cochrane, 1894, pg.9East Monmouth, Maine “Not many years ago, a massive Indian skeleton was exhumed at East Monmouth. Byproceeding carefully, the entire frame was unearthed. It proved to be that of agiant, measuring almost seven and a half feet in height. The skull is said to beas large as a common iron tea kettle.” A History of Swan’s Island, Maineby H.W. Small, M.D., 1898Hocomock’s Head, Swan Island, Maine “In these ancient shell heaps have been found, by men of our present day, flintarrow heads and hatchets which must have taken much skill and patience inmaking. These must have been their implements used in hunting and perhaps inwarfare. The promontory where the light-house stands, near the entrance to OldHarbor, is called Hocomock, a name given to it by the Indians long before thewhite men came. It may have been their name for this locality. Near to HocomockHead is a point of land extending into the harbor, called Burying Point. A largenumber of Indian skeletons were unearthed by the plow. They were found mostplenty near the Middle Head and near the ‘Carrying-Place’, which places weretheir burying-grounds. The skeletons were found just beneath the turf and wereof large size, showing a race of much larger stature than the Indian of today.This tribe made irregular visits to the island for many years after the whitesettlers came, but of late, since their number has so decreased, they haveceased altogether.” Skeletons of Giant Red MenThe Lewiston Evening Journal, July 25, 1907, pg.2Bath, Maine “It is likely that the visitors of the Tercentennial, either at Bath or atPopham, may have the privilege of seeing skeletons of two of the magnificentspecimens of physical manhood such as the American Indian of the days Sebenio,Samoset, Nahanada and Sansoa really were. Which, being interpreted, is that whenJames Perkins dug the cellar of his house at Popham Beach, on the knoll nextnorth of the Riverside Hotel, the skeletons unearthed, who were, in life fromsix to seven feet in height, giants in fact. Mr. Perkins took the jaw bone ofone of these Indians and placed it on his own face. It completely encased hisjaw and he is a pretty good sized man. Mr. Perkins gathered all the bones ofthese two skeletons together and placed them in a barrel and reinterred them so.It is proposed to dig up the barrel and have the bones set together toillustrate what manner of inhabitants Weymouth and Popham discovered in theearliest years of the 17th century when they arrived in this section of Maine.” The fact that these giant remains are still buried would make for an interestinginvestigation, but would he really make up stories of giant skeletons? If so,for what gain? Captain James E. Perkins was born in 1867 and grew up in PophamVillage. He was also an accomplished portrait photographer and the PenobscotMuseum has 530 glass plate negatives of his work. Perkins was reported to havebeen keenly interested n the history of Maine and had a love for his community.He passed away in 1935. Unearthed Skeleton with Indian Arrow in SkullOctober 17, 1912Kennebunkport, Maine “Three skeletons, believed to be those of early American settlers, wereunearthed here by workmen leveling some land near an old fort erected during thewar of 1912. Two apparently were victims of Indian massacres or wars. Embeddedin the skull of one of the skeletons was an Indian arrow. The tip of the skullof the second was chipped off cleanly as if done by a tomahawk held in a welltrained hand. The third skeleton was that of a man 7 feet tall. It is believedthat the bodies were buried in an old cemetery on this spot and that the graveswere covered over by earth thrown up when the fort excavations were being made.”4126.png [../Images/image00411.jpeg]Old Postcard of Indian Stone Mound at Westfork, Maine. "},{"pageContent":"6. Anatomic Anomalies Hundreds of reports across the United States demonstrate some very unusualanatomical features. These include macrocephalic (large) skulls, double rows ofteeth, elongated craniums, powerful jaws, and even horned skulls. In thischapter we will go through these anomalies case by case from officialSmithsonian reports, newspaper articles, and letters and journals from doctorsand respected members of the local community. Obviously there are earlierreferences in the Native American oral tradition, and some even described by theearly American presidents. This first account describes a skull six times largerthan average!Mansfield Daily Shield - Nov 25, 1904Mansfield%20Daily%20Shield%20-%20Nov%2025%2c%201904%20pg%201.jpg[../Images/image00412.jpeg]In the first part of this chapter we will examine a few of several hundredreports that say the jaw could fit over the face of a normal sized man, or evenput their entire head easily within these massive skulls, creating a ‘SkullHelmet’! But first let’s take a look at one of the consistent anomalies that hasbeen noted across North America, that has been labeled “The Adena Jaw.” The Adena Jawep3-jaw.bmp [../Images/image00413.jpeg]Reconstruction of a massive jaw fitting over the face of a man. Powerfully Built IndividualsThe Work of Don Dragoo Charles Snow and William Webb unearthed the “7-foot” Kentucky Giant at the Dovermound (carbon dated to 2,650 years old) in 1951. The Carnegie Museum’s DonDragoo also unearthed giant skeletal remains in the late 1950s. Dragoo wasdirectly affiliated with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburghfrom the years 1952-1977. He is considered the last of the great Adena scholarsand by the end of his career was named curator of the Carnegie‘s Section ofAnthropology. In discussing these honored dead and referring to this tallerAdena stature, he says in his Mounds for the Dead: “Two outstanding traits have been noted repeatedly for this group. One is theprotruding and massive chin often with prominent bilateral protrusions. Thesecond trait is the large size of many of the males and some of the females. Notonly were these Adena people tall, but also the massiveness of the bonesindicates powerfully built individuals. The head was generally big with a largecranial capacity.” 1 Dragoo named the anatomic anomaly of a massive jaw, the “Adena Jaw” after theAdena Mound Builder civilization, he also mentions the “massiveness” of thebones, a recurrent theme in these giant finds. A History of the Valley of Virginiaby Samuel Kercheval, Charles Faulkner and John Jacob, 1833, pg.59Shannondale Springs, West Virginia A few of the notable points from this document from 1833 mention an enormousjawbone dug up with the teeth in a perfect state of preservation. A skeleton of“unusual“ size with a 3 ft thigh bone and massive jawbone that “would pass overany common man’s face with ease” were reported. A 7ft skeleton was alsomentioned. If measured correctly, a 3 ft thigh bone would make this gentlemanten or eleven feet tall. Only a few eleven-footers have been reported (seeCurious Artifacts chapter for another one that tall). An Indian Mound OpenedThe Grange Advance, October 15, 1873, pg.4Arcadia, Minnesota Another burial mound, another giant reported, another jawbone large enough tofit over a large man’s face: “A few days ago the men engaged in building the road bed of the Green Bay andWinona railroad struck an Indian mound near Arcadia.... The skeleton of anIndian was found of such dimensions as to indicate that the frame must have beenthat of a giant. The jaw bone easily enclosed the face of the largest laborer tobe found on the work. The thigh bones were more like those of a horse than of aman, heavy and remarkably well preserved. A number of Mexican coins were alsofound. The unusual size of the skeleton has excited considerable interest andthe curiosities will be carefully preserved for exhibition.” A Giant in StatureA History of the Pioneer Families of Missouri, 1876, pg.101Montgomery County, Missouri This report is fascinating because the classic traits described are actuallythose of an Indian chief who died in the early 1800s, suggesting their lineagecontinued up to recent times. In describing a local Indian war, the history bookmentions that: “...one of their chiefs, named Keokuk, a man of some distinction, was wounded,and died shortly after. He was buried in the prairie...of the present town ofWellsville, in Montgomery County. In 1826 his remains were taken up by Dr. Bryanand several other gentlemen....He was evidently a giant in stature, for the jawbone, which, with several other bones of the body, are still preserved by Dr.Peery, will fit over the face of the largest sized man.” 2 History of Kentucky, by Lewis Collins, 1877 Remarkably, there are four separate accounts of giants unearthed with jawbonesthat fit over the finders face, buried obscurely in Collins History of Kentucky.We don’t imagine that these farmers from the 1800s were all contacting eachother to get in on the same hoax. After reading through all these accounts inthe same publication, one has to ask some big questions: Page 107: “On the farm of Judge T. C. Carson, 7 miles below Morgantown, areseveral mounds - one 8 or 10 feet high, covering between a quarter and half acreof land. No bones have been found in it; but from a smaller one, a number ofbones belonging to a giant race have been taken - jaw bones which would go overthe whole chin of a man and teeth correspondingly large; the teeth remainedsound but the other bones crumbled on exposure to the air. In Saltpeter cave, inthe Little Bend of Green river, a number of such bones were found.” Page 524: “Ancient Cemetery­—A Race of Giants. On five high points on CaldwellCampbell’s farm and on a farm of Samuel and Walker Mason, adjoining 8 miles SWof Richmond, are burial grounds of pre-historic inhabitants - in all embracing 3acres. On one part, about one and a half acres, have been discovered theskeletons of giants - the femur, tibia, skull and inferior maxillary bones solarge, when compared with the size of the late John Campbell (himself 6 feet 4inches in height), as to indicate a race 7 or 8 feet high. John Campbell slippedthe jaw-bone of one entirely over his own, flesh and all.” Page 666: “A Giant—Early in 1872, in prospecting coal in Ohio County, out a milefrom Rockport, the complete skeleton of a human body of gigantic size was found,6 feet below the surface. The lower jaw-bone, when fitted over the lower portionof a man’s face in the party of explorers, completely covered it: the thighbone, from the hip-bone to the knee, was 42 inches long and the fore-arm bonefrom wrist to elbow measured 22 inches. This would indicate a giant over 10 feethigh.” Page 722: “Antiquities­—A Giant. From a mound on the farm of Eden Burrows, nearFranklin, were exhumed, in May, 1841, at a depth of over 12 feet, several humanskeletons. One, of extraordinary dimension, was found between what appeared tohave been two logs, covered with a wooden slab. Many of the bones were entire.The under jaw-bone of one was large enough to fit over the jaw, flesh and all,of any common man of the present day. The thigh-bones were full six incheslonger than those of any man in Simpson county. Teeth, arms, ribs, and all, gaveevidence of a giant of a former race. Around his neck was a string of 120 copperbeads, and one bead of pure silver.” These are great examples of obscure references to giants and large jawbonesfitting over someone’s face, buried deep in historical documents. These areobservations, often by regular people unburdened by having to make evidence fita particular theory. Giants are mentioned as matter-of-fact as how many cows Mr.Johnson had on his farm—without fanfare, just simply stating what is seen beforeones eyes—reported in every corner of the country for over 100 years. Prehistoric GiantThe Evening Bulletin, March 21, 1882, pg.3Manchester, Ohio Another report from Ohio, who may be leading the league in giant reports: “A few days ago, some boys digging in an earth mound a short distance aboveManchester, Ohio, brought to light a human skeleton in a good state ofpreservation, that measured over nine feet in length. The head was of anenormous size, the jaw-bone fitting loosely over the head of a large man. Towhat race of the past these remains belong and from whence the race came orwhere they went must forever remain a mystery. The discovery of the bones hascreated a sensation and is attracting much interest.”Pioneers of the Western Preserve by Harvey Rice, 1883, pp.172-174Conneaut, Ohio, 1800 This is a very interesting account that also speculates as to the origins of thegiants in North America: “In excavating some of these mounds in the year 1800, human bones of giganticproportions were discovered in such a state of preservation as to be accuratelydescribed and measured. The cavities of the skulls were large enough in theirdimensions to receive the entire head of a man of modern times and could be puton one’s head with as much ease as a hat or a cap. The jaw-bones weresufficiently large to admit of being placed so as to match or fit the outside ofa modern man’s face. The other bones, so far as discovered, appeared to be ofequal proportions with the skulls and jaw-bones, several of which have beenpreserved as relics in the cabinets of antiquarians where they may still beseen... The gigantic dimensions of these bones refute the idea that they weredescended from any of the European continent, but indicate that there was in theearly ages a race of giants on the earth, who have long since become extinct.” Giants Skulls and Mighty Jaws from Two StatesThe New York Sun, December 15, 1886, pg.4Illinois and Florida Reported are two separate accounts from different states on the same day, andthey both happen to describe the same anatomic anomaly: “A mound near Liverpool, Illinois., was recently opened and several skeletons ofvery large men were found. The skulls were so large that they would go over anordinary man’s head, covering it to the shoulders. There was also found a smallsteel anvil, perfect in form and so hard that a file made little impression onit. Also a set of false teeth, of copper and ivory, large enough for a giant andof excellent workmanship.” The second account reads as follows: “Henry Gwaltney dug into a mound near Wakulla, Fla. recently and found a skullthat must have belonged to a giant. The under jaw was particularly large, beingtwice the size of an ordinary man’s and none of the teeth was missing fromeither jaw but one showed signs of decay.” Giant false teeth of copper and ivory, skulls so large they go over an ordinarymans head, and a giant jawbone twice the normal size. These are certainly worthyof further investigation. Nine Feet TallThe Sunday Vindicator, Sep 12, 1897, pg.9Connersville, Indiana This one from Indiana is of a 9 ft skeleton. It is reported that “the femur boneis a yard along.”9-feet-tall-indiana.jpg [../Images/image00414.jpeg] Remarkable SkeletonThe Omaha Daily Bee, December 25, 1897, pg.6Southeast Iowa The article reports the opening of a burial mound in Southeastern Iowa in whichmany artifacts and a giant skeleton were found. “One remarkable skeleton was dug up by myself and another man. It was that of agiant, being over seven feet six inches in height. An idea of the size of thisman may be gained by the length of his shin bone. I stood it on the ground at myheel and it reached about two inches above my knee joint, being twenty-fiveinches in length. The only part of the skeleton we were able to take away wasthe jawbone. Everyone who has seen it says it is the most massive jaw ever seenby them. It measures from the top of the front teeth to the lower edge of thejaw bone one and three quarter inches. Around the lower edge it measures six anda half inches across the jaw from the two tips is five and a half inches. It hasa remarkably perfect set of teeth.” Dug Up A Skeleton Eight Feet LongThe Washington Post, December 4, 1898Londonderry, Ohio At four feet below a gravel bed an 8-footer with prominent features on theskull, was found holding some interesting artifacts:“a dozen darts of the finest workmanship” were discovered. “The skull was athird larger than an average human skull, and the lower jaw was abnormal in sizeand thickness.” A Prehistoric GiantDaily Public Ledger., September 27, 1894, Pg 3Diamond Lake, Cass County, Michigan A controversial 11 ft giant skeleton was reported in Michigan 1n 1894: “The bones of the skeleton are well preserved. The lower jaw is immense. Anyordinary jawbone fits inside with ease.” This was later expanded upon in The Bruce Herald, Volume-XXX-Issue 3044, March10, 1899 with further details about artifacts and other mounds opened. As Jimwas checking the records for the Diamond Lake area, he found an 8-footerdiscovered in The History of Lake County, 1902: “Samuel Miller, who has resided in the county since 1835, is authority for thestatement that one skeleton which he assisted in unearthing was a trifle morethan eight feet in length, the skull being correspondingly large, while manyother skeletons measured at least seven feet.” Ancient Mystery Revealed -Unearthing of a Prehistoric GiantEvening Times, September 8th, 1899Akron, Ohio A 10 ft skeleton found in Akron, Ohio, that once again had a massive jawbone:“the lower jawbone of such proportion as to easily fit over the outside of thejaw of the largest modern man.”akron-ohio-sept-8.jpg [../Images/image00415.jpeg] Fierce Giant Lived in Cuyahoga CountyThe Stark County Democrat, December 12, 1902Cuyahoga County, Ohio “Evidence has just been secured which positively shows that the Cuyahoga valleywas once inhabited by a giant race of people. E. B. Howe, station agent atIra... has unearthed a rare collection of implements... The find consists of aportion of man who, when in life, was over eight feet tall. The jawbone is fullytwice as large as an ordinary human being’s jawbone. Near the skeleton was alsofound a stone ax weighing 14 pounds, rare copper beads and fine specimens ofcopper wedges and decorated pottery. Howe has in his possession 1,500 stoneimplements.” Old Prehistoric Giants FoundPittsburgh Press, September 13 and 14, 1932Finleyville, Pennsylvania This story was also picked up by The New York Times on September 14th. A highlydetailed account is given of the find, including a map of where the dig site waswith photos. We are told that the unearthing of prehistoric giants found nearFinleyville has focused the interest of scientists the world over upon a woodedhillside near Pittsburgh.Pittsburgh%20Press%2c%20September%2013th%20and%2014th%201932.bmp[../Images/image00416.jpeg] Excavators led by State Archaeologist D. S. Fisher unearthed 49 skeletons from aburial site in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Archaeologists were amazed atthe excellent condition of the teeth. The largest skeleton was a “giant” nearly8 feet high. It measured 89 inches from feet to skull and measured 26 inchesacross the chest. In the article there is a photo of Fisher examining “hugebones” and also a photo of some of the teeth. One female skeleton was noted forhaving “huge” teeth, all the skeletons had “massive jaws” and “strong” teeth.State archaeologist Fisher remarked, “never in all my finds have I seen strong,well preserved teeth such as these.” Fisher’s men also had to protect the siteas there were hundreds of onlookers.Jim found an article about another of Dr. Fisher’s finds a year later in ThePittsburg Press, September 7th, 1933: “G.S. Fisher of Finleyville, state archaeologist and discoverer of many relicsthat have found their way to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.already has unearthed 13 skeletons.” This story continued in The Pittsburg Press Oct 7, 1932 page 7, where we findthe following reported one month after the initial find: “The highly regarded Dr. Donald A. Cadzow is making the trip to the capital withall the skeletal remains from the dig, including a giant 7 feet 5 inches tall.” Cadzow was a former Cambridge University and British Museum Ethnologist andArchaeologist. As stated in the previous news report, Fisher, the StateArchaeologist had the bones at his workshop in Finleyville from the Septemberdig. In fact every detail carries over correctly from story to story. Gigantic Skullsskull-giant-human.bmp [../Images/image00417.jpeg] Jim and researcher Micah Ewers have come across references to 25 to 32 inchcircumference skulls pulled out of mounds in the Ohio Valley. There is also areference to a 40 inch circumference skull discovered in West Virginia (see page183). This is twice the size of a normal human skull. The Smithsonian have alsoreleased accounts of skulls well beyond the normal scope of humans.The 1873 Smithsonian Annual Report3 discusses a skull from Anna, Union County,Illinois, said to have been of “36 inches circumference” that was discovered ina mound, and that “parts of the skeletons found” were “very long.” Thirty sixinches is enormous because a normal man’s head is a hat size between seven andseven and a half, or 22 to 23 inches circumference, with flesh (or 20 to 21inches without flesh). If such a giant’s skull was in symmetric proportion tohis body frame—as even the pathological giants in European medical studiesconform to—then this skull may have pertained to someone between 9 and 12 feethigh. (this account is also in The Smithsonian Files Chapter). A Giant ExhumedNew Orleans Commercial Bulletin, May 7, 1852, pg.1Shippingsport, Kentucky In this early report that came about because of flooding between his two mills,Frank McHarra reported finding a giant skeleton that he estimated would havebeen upwards of 7 ft tall. “The skull was of immense size, with unusual high cheek bones - a sureindication of the Indian race.”New-Orleans%20Commercial%20Bulletin%20-%20May%207%2c%201852%20pg%201.jpg[../Images/image00418.jpeg] A Remarkable Skeleton UnearthedThe Public Ledger, August 25, 1870Janesville, Wisconsin “Several days ago, as some laborers were digging a foundation for a barn on thegrounds of Mr. Stanley, in the town of Janesville, they unearthed a humanskeleton of enormous size. It was found in a sitting posture, and is in a fairstate of preservation. The skull measured thirty-two and a half inches incircumference, and the thigh bones forty-four and half inches in length. Dr.Townsend examined the remains shortly after they were exhumed and gave it as hisopinion, that when living, the man must have been not less than thirteen feet inheight. It was immediately sold for $10,000.” So if the story is true, who is shelling out $10,000 in 1870 dollars (equivalentto $180,000 today) for a 13 ft skeleton? This report raises another intriguingaspect of this phenomenon: How many giant skeletons and bizarre artifacts mighthave ended up in the hands of private collectors? They must have really wantedthat skeleton, and we wonder, do they still have it? Giant Human Remains FoundThe New York Times, May 22, 1871Kern County, California and Jeffersonville, Kentucky Next to the Kern River a grave was dug that yielded a remarkable skeleton. Thefirst part of this account described it as being 7 ft 5 inches tall with acranium so large that “a full-grown person placed his head inside the skull.”The Jeffersonville skeleton was said to be nearly 12 ft tall with a 3 ft thighbone. Pre-Historic Mound Builder is Shownas Nine-Foot Giant in Wooden ModelRandolph Register, September 21, 1938Cattaraugus County, New York At the Cattaraugus County Museum in New York exists evidence of an ancient raceof giants of a different sort. The museum houses woodenreplicas of two Mound Builders unearthed at the Cowan farm onConewango Road in the county. Charles Huntington claims he was present when theskeletons were unearthed in 1876 and secured the exact measurements made by Dr.Franklin Larkin and Dr. T. Apoleon Cheney to be the basis for the wooden models.Mr. Huntington’s replicas are of a 9-foot man and an over-7-foot female. SharonFellows of the museum sent us the images of the models, a newspaper account ofthe find from the Randolph Register, and contact information for the grandson ofMr. Huntington.Jim spoke with Joanne Huntington, the wife of Charles Huntington’s grandson. Shetold us Charles was an extremely bright and competent inventor who was driven bywhat he claims to have witnessed to create a memory of this incredible fact. Theaccount from the Randolph Register states that the original bones crumbled todust, but noted: “One of the hunters, Jeff Darling told Mr. Huntington that the jaw bone was solarge that when it was held to his face there was room for both his handsbetween his jaw and that of the skeleton.”Once again this anatomic anomaly appears. We decided to read through the Historyof Cattaraugus County4, knowing that these giant skeleton reports never happenin isolation. On page 13 we found this:“A remarkable characteristic of these skeletons was their enormous proportions.The skull of one of these skeletons would fit loosely on my head; a rib bonewould pass round me from spine to colon, a thigh bone reached from my knee tothe upper part of the hip-bone; and the sub-maxillary would incase [sic] my jawlike an easy-fitting mask. The teeth were enormous especially the molars. Anattempt was made to preserve portions of these remains, but by exposure to theatmosphere they crumbled to a fine powder. These people must have been at least8 feet high, with other proportions corresponding.” The included newspaper article also says the following,“Brought back from the obscurity of untold ages, a giant, nine-foot man has beenmodeled in wood by Charles Huntington of East Randolph. The model is based uponan image which has been forming in Mr. Huntington’s mind since the day, 62 yearsago, when he witnessed the exhuming of the skeletons of pre-historic moundbuilders at the N. E. G. Cowan farm on the Conewango Road. Measurements which hesecured at that time form the basis upon which the model was constructed…Whenseveral of the persons who saw these earlier figures expressed disbelief thatsuch large human beings had ever roamed the woods and fields of this vicinity,Mr. Huntington wrote to Albany for verification. He received a letter from C. A.Hartnagel, assistant state geologist, giving figures reported by T. ApoleonCheney, a Randolph man, who was present at the time the mound was opened. Mr.Cheney’s figures checked with those which Mr. Huntington had used. As an exampleof the remarkable size of the skeletons, the measurements of the os-femur [sic],or bone between the ankle and knee, was 28 inches in length. The facial angle of73 degrees and the high forehead would indicate a large degree of intelligence.” A Giant Skull FoundThe Omaha Daily Bee, May 25, 1882, pg.1Red River Valley, Illinois A giant skull is reported being found in the Red River Valley: “The only deposit yet found of this extinct race in that region is a skull ofimmense proportions, a singular formation. It has been turned over to ahistorical society for examination. The skull is a perfect specimen and showsconclusive evidence of a race of giant natives.”Omaha%20Daily%20Bee%2c%20May%2025%2c%201882%2c%20pg%201.jpg[../Images/image00419.jpeg] Must Have Been GoliathThe Providence Evening Press, September 13, 1883, pg.4Barnard, Missouri This report is 12-foot example from Missouri. We looked into the reality of thisaccount and found that J.H. Haley was a real person and gave a speech near tothis area in 1917.5 However, whether he measured this skeleton correctly isunknown, as a 12-foot skeleton and a 40 inch circumference skull are both wellbeyond the normal range: “Hon. J. H. Haley, a well known and reliable citizen of Barnard, Mo., wrote tothe St. Joseph Gazette the particulars of the discovery of a giant skeleton fourmiles southwest of that place. A farmer named John W. Hanson found the bonesprotruding from the bank of a ravine that has been cut by the action of therains during the past years. Mr. Hanson worked several days unearthing theskeleton, which proved to be that of a human being, whose height was twelvefeet. The head through the temple was twelve inches; from the lower part of theskull at the back was fifteen inches and the circumference forty inches. Theribs were nearly four feet long and one and three quarter inches wide. The thighbones were thirty inches long and large in proportion. When the earth wasremoved the ribs stood up high enough to enable a man to crawl in and explorethe interior of the skeleton, turn around and come out with ease. The firstjoint of the great toe, above the nail, was three inches long and the entirefoot eighteen inches in length. The skeleton lay on its face twenty feet belowthe surface of the ground and the toes were imbedded in the earth, indicatingthat the body either fell or was placed when the ground was soft. Some of thebones crumbled on exposure to air but many good specimens were preserved and arenow on exhibition at Barnard. Medical men are much interested. The skeleton isgenerally pronounced a valuable relic of the prehistoric race.” The Skeleton of a GiantThe Oswego Times and Express, November 12, 1883, pg.1Kingwood, West Virginia “A human skull was unearthed here which measures 40 inches around the forehead.The skeleton is supposed to have been 14 feet high.” As we discussed in the previous account from Missouri, 40 inches around theforehead is is at least twice the girth of a normal human skull. 14 ft is alsooutrageously tall. However, the skeleton’s height looks like it was just anestimate based on the size of the skull. Ten to Fifteen Feet Tall SkeletonsHistory of Dearborn and Ohio Counties Indiana, 1885, pg.584Whitewater, Ohio “There is a large mound in Mr. Allen’s field about twenty feet high, sixty feetin diameter at the base, which contains a greater proportion of bones than anyone I ever before examined, as almost every shovel full of dirt would containseveral fragments of a human skeleton....We examined from fifteen to twenty. Insome, whose height were from ten to fifteen feet, we could not find more thanfour or five skeletons....We found several skull, leg and thigh bones, whichplainly indicate their possessors were men of gigantic stature. The skull of oneskeleton was one-fourth of an inch thick; and the teeth were remarkably even,sound and handsome, all firmly planted. The fore teeth were very deep and not sowide as those of the generality of the white people. Indeed, there seemed agreat degree of regularity in the form of the teeth in all the mounds.” The measurements of “ten to fifteen feet” are most likely an exaggeration, butwe decided to include this story as it gives fascinating anatomic details. Bones of Ancient GiantThe Branford Oregon Opinion, January 14, 1913Ellensburg, Oregon L. L. Sharp, the chief at the local land office considers the finding of askeleton “at least 8 feet high to be one of the most interesting anthropologicalfinds in the Northwest.” Mr Sharp also notes: “The head is one of the most remarkable I have ever studied among prehistoricskulls. It is massive with enormous brain space.”ellensburg-oregon-1913.jpg [../Images/image00420.jpeg] The article goes on to give more detailed anatomical descriptions such as “theforehead slopes down”, “the cheekbones are not high, like those of the Indian”and it had a “well rounded space at the back of the head.” Jim also uncovered anearlier version of this story from 1912.6A year earlier in the same area, 11 giant skeletons with double rows of teethwere reported (see next chapter). Gigantic Skull Poses ProblemThe Spokesman-Review, July 21, 1936, pg.10San Bernardino, Californiagiant-skull-poses-problem.jpg [../Images/image00421.jpeg] “Deputy Coroner E. P. Doyle asked scientific help today in identifying amysterious human skull one and a half times the size of a modern man’s. Withother portions of a skeleton the skull was unearthed by a steam shovel operatorhere. It has a huge prognathus jaw, high cheek bones and jutting teeth in theupper jaw. The relics which included several vertebrae, a leg bone and threefinger bones, were in a stratum of hard-packed rock eight feet underground.”Beach Giant’s Skull Unearthedby WPA Workers Near VictoriaSan Antonio Express, January 7, 1940, pg.68Victoria County, Texas In 1939 a skull was unearthed that was believed to be the largest skull in theworld, as it was twice the size of a normal human cranium.Several large human bones were also unearthed at the site. Marcus S. Goldstein,the physical anthropologist in charge of the find was formerly an aide to Dr.Aleš Hrdlička of the Smithsonian.“Twice the size of the skull of normal man, the fragments were dug up by W.Duffen, archaelogist, who is excavating the mound in Victoria County under a WPAproject sponsored by the University of Texas. In the same mound at the samelevel, a normal sized skull was found. The pieces taken from the mound werereconstructed in the WPA laboratory under supervision of physicalanthropologists.”texas-1939-large-skull [../Images/image00422.jpeg] Goldstein wrote: “A couple of unusual crania were unearthed at Morhiss Mound in Victoria County.One of these, although much mended and its base quite warped, is neverthelessobviously a skull of extraordinary size, in many respects larger than any yetreported. The possibility of abnormality, perhaps an endocrine disturbance,arose immediately, but the largeness of the skull seems to be symmetrical, thehand bones do not show the ‘knobbing’ typical of acromegaly, Moreover, othercrania from the same site approximate the skull in question. Hence, it is myopinion that this exceptionally large skull was not the result of endocrinepathology.” 7 Horned Skulls Perhaps the strangest anatomic anomaly reported are those skulls found withhorns. Even today there are people alive who have strange protrusions from theforehead called Cutaneous horns.8 There have been a small number of reports inAmerica, but it is the one allegedly photographed at Sayre, Pennsylvania (seephoto below) that we investigate first. Several newspapers reported on thiscontroversial discovery. Here is one of the printed headlines:horned-skull-sayre-report.jpg [../Images/image00423.jpeg]One version of the story is here in full from The New York Times: Scientists Unearth Relics ofIndians Who Lived 700 Years AgoNew York Times, July 14, 1916Sayre, Pennsylvania“Professor A. B. Skinner of the American Indian Museum, Prof. W. K. Morehead ofthe Phillips Andover Academy, and Dr. George Donohue, Pennsylvania StateHistorian, who have been conducting researches along the Susquehanna haveuncovered an Indian Mound at Tioga Point, on the upper portion of Queen EathersFlats, on what is known as the Murray farm, a short distance from Sayre Penn.,which promises rich additions to Indian lore. In the mound uncovered were foundthe bones of sixty-eight men which are believed to have been buried 700 yearsago. The average height of these men was seven feet, while many were muchtaller. Further evidence of their gigantic size was found in large celts or axeshewed from stone and buried in the grave. On some of the skulls two inches abovethe perfectly formed forehead, were protuberances of bone. Members of theexpedition say that it is the first discovery of its kind on record and avaluable contribution to the history of the early races. The skull and a few ofthe bones found in one grave were sent to the American Indian Museum.”horned-skull-sayre.jpg [../Images/image00424.jpeg]Horned skull linked with Sayre story. However, there is some intrigue to explore first, as there is no mention of a‘horned skull’ in any of the archaeological reports from any of the threeexcavators. These are only in the newspaper reports. Professor A.B. Skinner, whowas one of the archaeologists conducting the dig, quickly wrote an editorial toThe New York Times explaining that not only were all the skeletons of normalsize but that there were deer antlers buried at the heads of the skeletons.Someone in the crowd yelled that they have horns (below is corroboration of hisexclamation in a later book).9horned-sayre-hoax.jpg [../Images/image00425.jpeg]Not that we thought Satan and his minions were buried in a Pennsylvania mound,but this is a cautionary tale not to believe everything that is written.Somewhere along the line, however, a controversial photo emerged of a hornedhuman skull. Its origins were for a long time a mystery, but over the years hasbecome attached to this Sayre story, mainly thanks to the internet. We askedresearcher Micah Ewers to investigate where the image came from and heeventually found that the skull was acquired in 1959 by the Surnateum: Museum ofSupernatural History. Here are the details of the specimen: Inv. SDD/pe-92464Exorcist’s basket and horned human skull. Acquired by the Surnateum in 1959.Origin: France (1920-1940). It was looked at in detail by their experts who tantalisingly concluded: “Although we thought that the object had been cleverly manufactured, an analysishas demonstrated that the horns are genuinely part of the skull. An in-depthexamination and X-rays leave no room for doubt: the skull is not a forgery.” 10 We follwed up by writing to the curator of the museum who contradicted what waswritten on the website. He said: “The horned skull is a skull made for a cult to Pan during the XVIIth century(Painswick). It’s perfectly made, but I don’t believe in the existence of hornedhumans, so it’s certainly a fake (but a real cult object).” 11 Whether this skull is genuine or not remains to be seen, but it certainly has noconnection to the Sayre story. Three Giant SkeletonsThe Hocking Sentinel, April 28,1898Toledo, Ohio Here is another news account that describes short horns on skulls: “Workmen in the employ of the Ferguson Construction Company excavating for theToledo and Ottawa Beach Railroad, a little beyond the city limits of Toledo,Ohio, unearthed three skeletons, evidently relics of some great race, as theywere about seven feet in length. Just where the ears should be on the head aresingular bony protruberances which curl forward. The finds were made in solidyellow clay about eight feet below the surface. The cut is through a largemound, not half of which has yet been torn up. Several stone tomahawks of largesize have been picked up in the locality.” Giant Bones Unearthed: Horns on the SkullMinnesota News, December 6, 1905Sulphur Springs, Indiana In this fascinating account Alonzo Lewis discovered a giant that had hornscoming out from above the ears; one of many found on his property. Here is thefull printed account:minnesota-hornskull.jpg [../Images/image00426.jpeg] Although these might well be hoaxes, numerous other reports of horned skullshave been found throughout America, but not from skeletons of a giant stature.For instance, at Silver Lake in Oregon in 1903, a skull was found buried in thelake’s beach.12 From 1910 to 1911 around 44 skeletons were unearthed in TapangoCanyon, California, “each has a horn-like development three inches long.”13Finally, some 4 feet tall, powerfully built “pygmie” skeletons with “long tails”were found in a cave on Repmans Hill in Virginia by two boys. These had hornsprotruding above the temples on the skull.14We will let the reader make of these reports what they will, but the eliminationof corrupted stories such as the Sayre example helps clear the way for accountsthat might have some basis in truth. Cranial Deformation Altering the shape of skulls is a practice that has been around for over 4,000years, most notably in Peru. However, it is also prevalent in Africa,Micronesia, ancient Egypt, and Central America. In North America it was apopular practice of the Chinookan tribes of the Northwest and the Choctaw of theSoutheast. The infamous Flathead Indians, strangely, did not practice cranialdeformation, but were given this name in contrast to other Salishan people whoused skull enhancement to make the head appear rounder. Other tribes, however,including the Choctaw, Chehalis, and Nooksack Indians, did practice headflattening by strapping the infant’s head to a cradleboard. The results areremarkably similar to thousands of skulls discovered in Peru. Interestingly,many of the South American examples have red hair and powerful jaws, like someof their North American counterparts. These examples below show a Flathead skull(top), and two images of Chinook Skulls with extreme deformation (bottom).schoolcraft2-318.jpg [../Images/image00427.jpeg]schoolcraft2-320.jpg [../Images/image00428.jpeg]flathead-schoolcraft2-332.jpg [../Images/image00429.jpeg] Chickasawba Mound, Arkansas1877 - 1976 From 1873 Frank Lowber James prepared a large map of 35 townships in MississippiCounty, Arkansas, that led to an interest in the ancient mounds. His first notedfind was in 1875 and was recorded in the Smithsonian accession records. InNovember of 1877, James wrote to Joseph Henry, the first secretary of theSmithsonian Institution requesting funds to open the mounds in the area: “It is the so-called Great Chickasawba mound, where for 10 acres, a spade canscarcely be thrust without turning up human remains, and those too of a mostinteresting and valuable character. Not only are these scattered bones in greatquantity, but entire skeletons of gigantic size are frequently found. I haveseen several over 7ft, 6in, in height. In these cases the vases or urns buriedwith them are large in proportion. Many of the crania found there show signs ofartificial flattening, some of them being pointed.” 15 In 1901, Curtis L. Little gained permission to excavate the site further: “The skeletons are very large and tall. One femur bone was unearthed thatmeasured 29 inches in length. The skulls are extremely large, the jaw of one issuch size that it would slip over my own and have considerable space to spare,being able to insert my first 3 fingers under the cheek bones. The skulls slopeback considerably and the frontal bones are very flat.” 16 A 29-inch femur suggests a skeleton over 8 ft tall, much taller than theprevious descriptions. Soon after this impressive discovery the area became‘open season’ and most of the site was destroyed. In 1976 a 7 ft skeleton wasunearthed whilst digging the basement for a house nearby.17 The Mummy of a Cliff Dweller FoundThe New York Times, March 8, 1896Prescott, Arizona This account was sent to Jim by researcher Gary David, who has writtenextensively about the accomplishments of Native civilizations in theAmerican Southwest. The photo is of Montezuma Castle National Monument, locatednear Camp Verde, Arizona which features well-preserved cliff-dwellings.They were built and used by the pre-Columbian Sinagua people, northern cousinsof the Hohokam around 700 AD. The structure is five stories high and took aboutfive centuries to complete. It was occupied from approximately 1100-1425 AD, andoccupation peaked around 1300 AD. However, they also had unusual burialpractices and strange skulls:Old photo of Montezumas Castle.Montezumas-castle-ID%20cph.3c13811.jpg [../Images/image00430.jpeg] “The mummy of one of the ancient cliff dwellers of Arizona, the first ofundoubted authenticity ever discovered, has been found by a hunter well known inNorthern Arizona, John McCarty...The body is that of a male and is of unusuallygreat stature...In the skull, however, lies the element of greatest interest.The formation is entirely different from that typical of the ancient dwellers inthe valleys of Arizona. The valley dwellers were Toltecs of almost Caucasiancranial features. The skull of the mummy, with forehead retreating from the noseand large rear development, is of the Aztec type. The teeth are entire and wellpreserved and protrude as in the same canine tribe. As the mummy showed signs ofdisintegration, McCarty has given it a coat of varnish, preparatory to placingit in an air-tight glass-covered box.” Huge Jawbone & Cranial DeformationThe History of Cape May, by Lewis T. Stevens, 1897, pg.11Cape May, New Jersey “A skull was exhumed which must have belonged to one of great age, as thesutures were entirely obliterated and the tables firmly cemented together. Fromthe superciliary ridges, which were well developed, the frontal bone recededalmost on a direct line to the place of the occipital and parietal sutures,leaving no forehead and has the appearance of having been done by artificialmeans, as practiced at present on the Columbia among the Flat Heads. A jaw-boneof huge dimensions was likewise found, which was coveted by the observer; butthe superstitions of the owner of the soil believing it was sacrilegious andthat he would be visited by the just indignation of Heaven if he suffered any ofthe teeth to be removed, prevailed on us to return again to its mother earth.” Drat, that fellow should have risked going to hell and saved the jawbone. Butnot just the jaw, as this skull shows clear signs of cranial deformation. The St. Johns Herald, January 6, 1900Apache Country, Arizona “At a depth of 20 feet, large slabs of stone were encountered; there were threeof them. When thee slabs were removed, three cemented vaults contained threemummified skeletons. Two of the skeletons are 7 ½ feet long and one 8 ½ feetlong. She brought with her the head and the neck of the largest skeleton. Thehead is very large; the jawbone will fit on the outside of the jaw of a livingman with a large head; the teeth are massive and over an inch in length; theforehead is low; ears and mouth very large; top of the head runs up to a peak.One of the giants had two flint arrowheads buried in his skull. The teeth of thehead brought away, contained pieces of dried flesh, which pronounced to be thatof a human being, showing that the giants were cannibals.”This also again points to the ancient enemy of Native Americans, an enemyfrequently described in the oral traditions of many tribes (see Legends of theTall Ones chapter for more examples).Snake_priests_out_at_sunrise_to_hunt_for_ceremonial_snakes_on_first_day_of_Snake_Dance_Ceremony_at_the_pueblo_of_Oraibi%2c_Arizona%2c_1898_(CHS-4658).jpg[../Images/image00431.jpeg] Image: Snake priests out at sunrise to hunt for ceremonial snakes on first dayof Snake Dance Ceremony at the pueblo of Oraibi, Arizona,1898 Giant Skeletons in the Gravel PitThe Daily Press, August 3, 1905Dayton, Ohio The sub-headings stated: “Had great length of arms,” and “Skull long and narrow,indicating cranial deformity.” This is a good example of classic cranialenhancement, but as for the arms, that’s just weird:The%20Daily%20Press%2c%20August%203%2c%201905%20Dayton%2c%20Ohio%20%20.jpg[../Images/image00432.jpeg] “...several giant skeletons having been unearthed...the skeleton beingremarkable for the great length of the arms... Attorney T. B. Herman, Republicancandidate for city solicitor, was present when the find was made. He was with[Warren K.] Moorhead when the latter opened the mounds in Ohio and later claimedthat the skeleton in Edgar’s pit in no way compares with those of the moundbuilders. The skeleton is believed to be that of an Indian or other aboriginefurther removed in the scale of mankind. The skull was long and narrow andindicating a decided cranial deformity.” Skeleton of A Giant Fully Eight Feet TallEl Paso Herald, April 19, 1915Silver City, New Mexico A report of the unearthing of a giant skeleton from New Mexico with cranialdeformities is given: “A peculiarity of the forehead is that it recedes from the eyes like that of anape. The similarity is still further found in the sharp bones under the eyes.The skeleton was found encased in baked mud, indicating that encasing the corpsein mud and baking them was the mode of embalming.” It also points out that the cliff dwellers lived in the same area as giants.Were these cliff dwellings built to keep them safe from these invading titans?“It is rather peculiar that less than 30 miles from where this skeleton wasfound and located on the Gile river are the former houses of a tribe of smallcliff dwellers. The existence of these two races so near together form aninteresting topic.” Finds Skeleton of Ancient Maya IndianThe Chester Times, November 2, 1925, pg.3St. Joseph, Missouri A skeleton unearthed in Missouri is thought to be Maya because the of curiousskull: “A skeleton, seven feet two inches long, believed to be that of a member of theancient Maya people, has been found beneath a creek bed near Fairfax, Mo., FrankPlumb, student of Anthropology, announced yesterday. The low, slanting skull,Mr. Plumb said indicated Maya origin, as it was the practice of this people toflatten the foreheads of their infants.” A more detailed account is found in The Miami News page 30 on the same day,describing another elongated skull that was unearthed: “Anslem Schumacher of Maryville, archeologist, discoverer of Indian graves andrelics, who went to view Mr. Plumb’s discoveries, also found a skull similar tothat found by Mr. Plumb.” Expedition Starts to Bring Skeletonfrom Cape FloridaFlorida-Miami News, June 9, 1936Cape Sable, Florida This account describes the unearthing of an 8 ft tall skeleton. The skull wasidentified by Karl Squires as being 3/4 of an inch thick; twice the thickness ofa normal skull. Some other anomalies were noted: “The peculiar shape of the bones brought immediate attention and the remainderof the skeleton was unearthed. Eyes and ears of the early Floridian were setunusually high in the head which had a protruding chin and a receding forehead.” In the next chapter we will look at the most strange and controversial anomalyreported—double rows of teeth.puma-punku-skull.bmp [../Images/image00433.jpeg]Above: Elongated skull found at Puma Punku in Bolivia.Middle: Selection of deformed skulls from the highlands of Peru.Bottom: Olmec skull on display at Xalapa Museum, Mexico.elongated-skulls-huaraz.bmp [../Images/image00434.jpeg]Xalapa-elongated-skull.bmp [../Images/image00435.jpeg]deformed-skull-Kane_Caw_Wacham.jpg [../Images/image00436.jpeg]Painting by Paul Kane, 1848, showing a Chinookan child in the process of havingits head flattened, being held by an adult who has already been through theprocess.

Double Rows of Teeth “...in the time of Hadrian the Emperor (76 AD-138 AD), there was raised from theearth, in a place called Messana (Carthage), the body of the giant called Ida,who was twenty feet in length and who had double sets of teeth or two rows ofteeth still standing completely preserved in his head or in his gums.” 1DTY-pic.jpg [../Images/image00437.jpeg] One of the strangest anatomic anomalies we find widely reported is double rowsof teeth (DRTs). Huge jaws and perfect teeth—often found with no decay—arereported in dozens of accounts, suggesting they either had good dentists or itwas a genetic trait. But it’s the supernumerary teeth that appear in a muchhigher frequency than normal. In this chapter, we will look at several reportsof double rows of teeth, supernumerary teeth (extra single teeth) and even onereport of a third set.Hyperdontia is a medical condition that is an infrequentdevelopmental anomaly that can appear in any area of the dental arch and canaffect any dental organ.2 Adults have 28 teeth that can increase up to 32 toinclude the ‘wisdom teeth’ (third molars). As we’ll see in these accounts, thisnumber was sometimes much higher when a greater height was involved, but eventoday there is no clear reason why they occur. Hugh met up with a dentalanthropologist to analyse these accounts, who was so blown away by these reportsthat she described it as being as rare as “a race of three armed people”. In TheNatural History of the Human Teeth, Joseph Cox describes an interestingabnormality that may give a clue to why this phenomenon occurs: “The lateral incisors grew in line even with supernumerary teeth, behind thecentral incisors and cuspidati, and so formed a second row. This was the mostconspicious deformity of the teeth I ever saw, for the mouth could not be openedto speak without completely presenting them to view.” 3 He goes on to describe another variant where extra teeth had “pushed” throughthat “produced an appearance of a double-row”.Harold T. Wilkins, in his book Secret Cities of Old South America also describesthis phenomenon. First he speaks of a skull found in California, “an amazinghuman skull of giant size with a double row of teeth” (which is probably theLompock Rancho case we examine in this chapter), but then he writes thefollowing: “A truly amazing corroboration of the dentition of these antediluviangiants of Ancient America is found in the Hulin section of the Berakthoth, ofBabylonian Talmud, were it said the Giants, before the Great Deluge, hadnumerous rows of teeth. The Old compilers of the Hulin can hardly be said tohave heard of this California find!”4 It looks like Wilkins must have got hisinformation from the Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906, where it says: “Some of thesegiants had feet 18 ells in length,5 and the same length is given for thethigh-bone.6 Numerous rows of teeth are also ascribed to them.”7We decided to look in more detail at this old Babylonian Talmud, which is a hugevoluminous work written in the Chaldaic language about two thousand years ago,that does mention this phenomenon along with giants before the great deluge. Forexample: “Who hath ever laid open the front of his garment? or who can penetrateinto his double row of teeth.”8 It goes on to talk about Og, King of Bashan, whowas a known giant:“...his teeth bent themselves upon one side and upon the other”, suggesting histeeth jutted out like fangs or tusks. Another unusual description may also bereferencing double rows of teeth: “Thy teeth are like a flock of well-selectedsheep, which are come up from washing, all of which bear twins....and none isbarren among them.”9 In the Benson Commentary of the Bible it discusses thispassage explaining that the mention of twins “...seems to denote the two rows ofteeth: and none is barren among them — Not one tooth is lacking.”10 The jury isout if this does mean double rows of teeth, but it at least may indicate theconnection between giant people in biblical times and the supernumerarypeculiarity.ep1-DTTs.bmp [../Images/image00438.jpeg]Reconstruction of set of doubleteeth in a giant skull.Please take a look at these accounts and make up your own mind, as these clearlyshow a mystery of the giants that is yet to be solved. Then we’ll delve into thearguments for and against DRT connection to giants and get the view of a dentalanthropologist from New York University. Indian Graves in Concord, N.H.Concord, New Hampshire, 1856 An early report from New England states: “The skull is very thick, the teeth inboth jaws are entire, and all of them double”. The Cardiff Giant Outdone:Alleged Discovery of a Giant in The Oil RegionsOil City Times, January 6, 1870West Hickory, Pennsylvania This report originally came from the Oil City Times in 1870 and underneath theimmense armor, it revealed some startling anatomic oddities: “They exhumed an enormous helmet of iron, which was corroded with rust. Furtherdigging brought to light a sword which measured nine feet in length.”The report continued that they had discovered: “...a well-preserved skeleton of an enormous giant....The bones of the skeletonare remarkably white. The teeth are all in their places, and all of them aredouble, and of extraordinary size”.2164.png [../Images/image00439.jpeg] This is the tallest skeleton we have in this book! It was estimated to be 18feet tall, and the bones were being prepared to be sent to New York. Clearly,however, this could be an exaggeration, as 18 ft is unheard of in the historicalrecord. Interestingly the discovery was reported to be buried 12 feet below amound, so it could suggest a deep antiquity, however tall he was. The Remans of a Gigantic RaceThe Ohio Democrat (Logon, Ohio), June 10, 1893Vasa, Minnesota Twenty-three-years later a report from Vasa, Minnesota revealed another reportof double rows of teeth: “The remains of a gigantic race of extinct human beings have been discoverednear Vasa, Minn. Each had double teeth in front as well as in the back part ofthe jaw”. The Aborigines of MinnesotaBy JV. Brower, AJ. Hill and TH. Lewis. pp.215-216, 1906-1911Delano, Minnesota, 1878 In The Aborigines of Minnesota it states that while digging Howard Lake mounds,some decayed bones were discovered: “According to the Delano Eagle, June 13th 1878, one of the mounds on the southside of Twelve-Mile creek, about three miles from Delano, was explored by aparty of young gentlemen. At the depth of five feet they found two humanskeletons, the size of which indicated sons of Amalek. The bones were in thelast stages of decay. One thigh-bone measured 20 inches in length and wasproportionately large. The teeth were still sound, and double all round, thoughnot of large size, but worn flat from long use”.Vasa-minn-map.jpg [../Images/image00440.jpeg]Early map of the Howard Lake mounds.Further skeletal discoveries were made nearby: “The lower jaw-bones were large, the teeth, so far as found, all double, thebrow considerably receding backward.”Skulls and bones from a nearby mound in Minnesota showingreceding foreheads and powerful jaws, 1867The%20Aborigines%20of%20Minnesota-image.jpg [../Images/image00441.jpeg] Double All the Way AroundHistory of Medina County, 1881Medina County, Ohio Nine human skeletons were found when Albert Harris was digging the foundationsof his house. In describing the tomb he said: “It looked as if the bodies had been dumped into a ditch. Some were burieddeeper than others,, the lower one being about seven feet below the surface.When the skeletons were found, Mr. Harris was twenty years of age, yet he statesthat he could put one of the skulls over his head, and let it rest upon hisshoulders, while wearing a fur cap at the same time. The large size of all thebones was remarked, and the teeth were described as ‘double all the wayaround.’” Skeleton of A Very Large Person, All Double TeethIronton Register, May 5,1892Proctorville, Ohio This tantalising report not only mentions a giant skeleton, but suggests anancient, sophisticated settlement once existed in the area:“Where Proctorville now stands was one day part of a well paved city, but Ithink the greater part of it is now in the Ohio River. Only a few mounds, there;one of which was near the C. Wilgus mansion and contained a skeleton of a verylarge person, all double teeth, and sound, in a jaw bone that would go over thejaw with the flesh on, of a large man; the common burying ground was well filledwith skeletons at a depth of about 6 feet. Part of the pavement was of boulderstone and part of well preserved brick.” Official Smithonian ReportAnnual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1875, pg.392Amelia Island, Florida This Smithsonian report also describes double rows of teeth, well-preservedcanines, and even evidence in one account, of triple-rows of teeth. This was faraway from the mound cultures of the north. In early 1875, Augustus Mitchell,M.D., of Saint Mans, Georgia, was collecting specimens for ornithology inFlorida to escape the cold winter. He excavated a mound on the southern end ofAmelia Island, that was 15 feet high, and about 30 feet in diameter. On one ofthe skulls he discovered he carefully examined the teeth and made somefascinating comments: “A bi-section of some of these teeth showed the dental nerve to be protected byan unusual thickness on the surface of the crown. Not one carious (decayed)tooth was found among the hundreds in the mound....In some the second set wasobserved; while one jaw had evident signs of a third set.” Further in the report, but slightly off-topic, was his amazement of anotherfind:“I came upon the largest-sized stone ax I have ever seen or that had ever beenfound in that section of the country.” Directly next to it was a well-preserved cranium, but it unfortunately turned todust within two hours of him piecing the skeleton together. However, heconfirmed the size of the skeleton: “According to the measurement of the bones of this skeleton, its height musthave been quite 7 feet.” Relics of Past AgesClinton Mirror, April 28, 1900, pg.7Eagle City, Ohio A giant skeleton was unearthed from a mound on the banks of the Iowa River, nearEagle City, that was once displayed in a shop window in Eldora:2291.png [../Images/image00442.jpeg] “The skull is very large and thick, full a quarter of an inch. A set of almostround double teeth are remarkably well preserved. They are yellow with age, areperfect in shape and appear to have been double, both above and below.” Dr. Morse’s only explanation of its true height was this: “The femurs are verylong, showing a giant in stature”. He also emphasised: “Dr N.C. Morse, a prominent physician, who examined the skeleton, pronounced itthat of a person who had evidently been trained for athletics, as theextremeties were so well developed.” Huge SkeletonsHistorical Collections of Ohio, Vol. 2, 1908. pg.350Noble County, Ohio, 1872 This matter-of-fact historical account of a skeleton “at least eight feet inheight” describes “double teeth in front as well as in back of mouth and in bothupper and lower jaws.”noble-county-ohio-8ft-DRT.jpg [../Images/image00443.jpeg] A History of Morrow CountyVolume 1, 1911, pg.14Morrow County, Ohio In this account, an intriguing comment caught our attention: “During the centuries of Indian domination in this country, the ancientearthworks were left undisturbed. The Indians had no knowledge of a preceedingrace, and they were not vexed by inquiring science as to the nature or originsof the mounds.” Although no DRTs are mentioned, the account recalls ‘extra’ teeth: “In 1829, when the hotel was built in Chesterville, a mound nearby was made tofurnish the material for the brick. In digging it away, a large human skeletonwas found, but no measurements were made. It is related that the jaw-bone wasfound to fit easily over that of a citizen of the village, who was remarkablefor his large jaw. The local physicians examined the cranium and found itproportionately large, with more teeth than the white race of today.” Race of Men Were GiantsThe Cambridge Sentinel, Volume IX, Number 40, July 20, 1912Craigshill, Ellensberg, Washington This report appeared in The Cambridge Sentinel in July 1912.11 It describes theunearthing of 11 giant skeletons from a cement rock formation over which was alayer of shale. As well as stating one of the jaws had “two rows of teeth in thefront upper jaw”, it also describes the jawbones as “so large they will goaround the face of the man of today.” We also see a description of an elongatedskull: “The sloping skull shows an extremely low order of intelligence, farearlier than that of the Indians known to the whites.”2375.png [../Images/image00444.jpeg]The report also states that “The femur is twenty inches long, indicating,scientists say, a man eighty inches tall” (nearly 7 feet). It emphasised that J.P. Munson was a professor of biology who lectured before the InternationalBiology College in Austria the previous year. Baptist Church - Newton CornerThe History of Middlesex County, Ma. Volume 2, 1880, pg.243Newton, Massachusetts “Five Indian skeletons and several ancient copper coins were turned up by thelaborers in digging the cellar for the building. The spot was probably once theseat of an Indian settlement and here they buried their dead. The jaw of one,which was in perfect preservation, with the full number of teeth, and double allround, was placed in the box, which was sealed and deposited under the cornerstone.” We investigated this account as part of the Search for the Lost Giants TV show,but came to a dead end due to the fact that the church has been demolished andis now the site of a car dealership, so getting to that box is now impossible.History%20of%20Middlesex%20County%2c%20Massachusetts%20-%20Containing%20Carefully%20...%2c%20Volume%202%20edited%20by%20Samuel%20Adams%20Drake%20-1880.%20pg%20243.jpg[../Images/image00445.jpeg] A History of Deerfield, MassachusettsBy George Sheldon, Volume 1. 1895, pg.78Deerfield, Massachusetts This 8-footer is covered in detail in the Giants of New England chapter: “...monstrous size—the head as big as a peck basket, with double teeth allround.” A History of Jefferson Countyby Franklin B.Hough. 1854, pg.12Rodman, Jefferson County, New York Two reports on consecutive pages give accounts of large skulls with double rowsof teeth.

So great hasbeen the length of time since these bones have been covered, that they fall topieces very soon after being exposed to the air.” Full set of Double TeethOnondaga, By Joshua Victor Hopkins Clark- 1849. pg.83Syracuse, New York, 1819 In this diary of Victor Hopkins Clark, he discusses how the town ofSyracuse was built over the Salt Springs Reservation, when the land was dividedup in 1794. A feud ensued with a neighboring tribe and the superbly named‘Handsome Harry’ was the last native to fall. “He was counted the handsomest manin the nation” they said. “Several skeletons were found...one of extraordinary size...The skull wascomparitively large, and the jaws were surrounded with a full set of doubleteeth, all around.

It reads: “The skull measures almost 12 inches in diameter, and there are two distinctrows of teeth in the massive jaw....The bones were at first thought to be theremains of some giant Indian, but the shape of the head is not, the shape of theskull peculiar to Indians.” There is something else here rather strange too: “The bones of the toes and fingers are remarkably well preserved and appear tohave something resembling claws attached.” It is now clear why the discoverer “...who, terrified at his find, ran,breathless, to the nearest farmhouse and notified the neighborhood.” Double Both Front and BackLogansport Pharos Tribune, June 19, 1912Lake Cicott, Indiana Charles Milton discovered a skeleton whilst digging sand around Lake Cicott. Itwas thought to be an area inhabited by Indians. The account states:“The jaw bone is almost twice as large as that of the ordinary person. Onepeculiarity about the jaw is the fact that the teeth are double both front andback.”12-Foot Giant in CaliforniaThe Native Races of the Pacific states of North America, By Hubert Howe, 1875Lompock Rancho, California, 1819 (and/or 1833) Hugh investigated this famous report back in November 2008, by visiting the areaof the actual ranch it was discovered on.“In 1819 an old lady saw a gigantic skeleton dug up by soldiers at Purisima onthe Lompock Rancho. The natives deemed it a god, and it was reburied bydirection of the padre.” 12 This short report re-emerged with a broader range of details in 1833 and nowvarious authors and websites repeat the same story. It goes something like this: Soldiers digging a pit for a powder magazine at Lompock Rancho, California,hacked their way through a layer of cemented gravel and found a 12 ftsarcophagus. The skeleton of a giant man about twelve feet tall was foundinside. The grave was surrounded by carved shells, huge stone axes, two spearsand thin sheets of porphyry (purple mineral with quartz) covering the skeleton.These were covered with unintelligible symbols. He had a double row of teeth,both upper and lower. The soldiers consulted a local tribe of Indians, who aftergoing into trance, exclaimed they were geographically displaced Allegewi Indiansfrom the Ohio Valley area. When the natives began to attach some religioussignificance to the find, authorities ordered the skeleton and all the artifactssecretly reburied. This version of events was published in 1979 in Giants: The Vanished Race ofMighty Men by Roy Norvill; in 1978 in Sowers of Thunder by Anthony Roberts, butthe original citing came from Gods, Demons and UFO’s, by Eric Norman (aka WarrenSmith), in 1971. Due to the confusion over this Jim located the followingarticle that clarifies the original report from 1819:“During the summer of 1862, a respectable old lady, a native of California, whoresides not far from the Mission of La Purisima, in Santa Barbara county,informed us that shortly after she was married, her husband, who was corporal ofthe soldiers kept at the mission about 1819, was with his men doing some workabout a well near the old mission of the same name, now situated on the ranchocalled Lompock-which was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1812, when at SanJuan Capistrano was also tumbled down, burying some fifteen people in the ruins.In the progress of their labors they disinterred a human skeleton of immensesize, which fact getting wind among the Indians of the mission, they came downin excited crowds to the soldiers and begged them to desist, as the bones werethose of whom they considered Gods, which, when disturbed, would work ruin anddestruction on all the country around. Seeing the trouble going on, the Padrescame among them and made the soldiers replace the bones from where they weretaken and forbade their being troubled afterwards.” 13 The Indians mentioned here are the Chumash, who used to call the area “Lum Poc”meaning “stagnant waters” or “lagoon.” In 1837 it was in the hands of theMexicans, but in 1846 the US gained control of the area, and by the Second WorldWar it was starting to be used as a military base. So the ranch is no longer aranch. It’s currently the Vandenburg Airforce Base and you are not allowedinside, especially if you are looking for a 12-foot -tall giant skeleton. Great Caves—Skulls with Double Rows of TeethThe Scientific American, Volume 6, pg.227, 1862Channel Islands, CaliforniaDRT-scientific-american-CA.jpg [../Images/image00447.jpeg] The Scientific American reported on numerous finds on the islands off the coastof California: “The Indian skulls with double rows of teeth are said to have been found notonly abundantly on San Clemente Island caves, but also often still on theneighbouring Island of San Miguel, the San Bernardo or Juan Rodriguez ofCabrillo.” The dating of these finds is said to be in the region of 3362-8000 years.14 Martha’s VineyardThe Story of Martha’s Vineyard by Charles Gilbert Hine, pg.136Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, 1908. On the opposite side of the country we find a similar account from 1908 on aremote island off the southeast corner of Massachusetts: “Some fifteen years ago the skeleton of an Indian giant in almost perfectpreservation was dug up in the same locality; the bones indicated a man easilysix feet and a half, possibly seven feet, high. An unusual feature was acomplete double row of teeth on both upper and lower jaws. After all the boneswere removed the place was carefully dug over, but no implements were found, asingular fact, as the Indians were supposed to always bury their implements withthe dead.” Skeletons of a Giant Race Found near PotosiUrbana Union, February 16 and Dubuque Times, Jan 5, 1870Potosi, Wisconsin “The evidence appears to be pretty well settled that this whole Western countrywas once inhabited by a race of beings of gigantic stature, which were not onlyhardworking, industrious fellows, but well up in many of the fine arts....One ofthem was found to be seven and a half feet and the other eight feet in length.The jaws of each were filled with double rows of teeth, while the cheek boneswere very high and prominent.” Drilled Skulls and Double Rows of TeethAmerican Antiquarian Vol. XII, No. 1, January 1890Detroit, Michigan This account contains a rare report of trepanning performed on human skulls.Although widely used in ancient Peru, it is not often reported in North America: “At one time or another, remains of some forty individuals have been discoveredin various excavations...At a depth of two feet, five skulls were found, lyingin a circle, facing the center. Within this circle were ashes and charcoal,evidence of fire; but the bones were not all burned... Of these five skullsthree were perforated, and perforated not with a single hole like those found byMr. Crillman, but with three like the one from Saginaw to which he refers in thepassage quoted. The three holes are drilled directly on top of the skull, arearranged in the form of a triangle and are a half an inch or so apart. Indiameter they range from one third to one half inch. The two unperforated skullsare smaller and more delicate than these three and were evidently skulls ofyoung persons or females. On the perforated skulls two had ‘double teeth’ infront. Mr. Bates says the third may have had also. (He is no longer in Detroitand some uncertainty exists in the matter.) The dentition of the other twoskulls is normal.” Remarkable Human SkeletonHistory of the Town of Rockingham, Vermont, pg.338, 1907Bellows Falls, Rockingham, Vermont Jim and Hugh investigated this giant report from Vermont as part of Search forthe Lost Giants TV show. In this local town history, the author re-tells thestory of the discovery of a giant when they were digging the ground to lay downrail tracks for the Cheshire Railroad in the mid 1800s: “When the earth was removed from the top of the ledges east of the falls aremarkable human skeleton, unmistakably that of an Indian was found. Those whosaw it tell the writer the jaw bone was of such size that a large man couldeasily slip it over his face, and the teeth, which were all double, wereperfect.” Unfortunately, they were mysteriously lost: “This skeleton was kept for many years deposited in the attic of a smallbuilding on the north side of the Square. This building was then occupied by Dr.John H. Wells’ office and drug store and stood where the Italian fruit store nowdoes. When the building was rebuilt a decade ago or more the bones disappeared.” As part of our investigation we visited the ancient burial site at Bellows Fallswhich is now an abandoned rail yard. One of the strange synchronicities thatoccurred when we examined the area was the profusion of ancient Native Americanpetroglyphs evident on large rocks on the water’s edge, that date back at leasthundreds, or maybe thousands of years. They consist of multiple abstract facescarved by the Abenaki Indians, with one that is much larger than the others, andappears to have unusual teeth. Is it the first depiction of a ‘double row ofteeth’?bellows-falls-petroglyphs-geoff.bmp [../Images/image00448.jpeg] The petroglyphs have been damaged over time, but some still exist. We climbeddown to see them close-up, but some are now partly buried under rocks. Many ofthem can be safely seen from the bridge at Bellows Falls. We were able to find afurther lithograph from Henry Schoolcraft sketched around 1860 that shows someof the original forms (see images below).bellows-falls-schoolcraft%20andphoto.bmp [../Images/image00449.jpeg] We also talked to members of the Bellows Falls Historical Society (see p.202)and were allowed to search through the hand written notes of Lyman Simpson Hayeswho would write the Town History of Rockingham in which he describes theunearthing of the giant skeleton. In his notes, which were the last draft beforehe created the final Town History, Hayes had inserted an “all” to accentuate thepoint that “all” the teeth of the giant skeleton were indeed double, as can beseen below.ep3-rockingham-DRT-text.bmp [../Images/image00450.jpeg]The skeleton was of the Native Chief Philip, who was known to have been ofexceptional stature in life and was killed by rifle fire in a battle on August17, 1755, as noted by John Kilburn. The Natives took the body of Philip andburied it under a flat rock so the white men could not find it. A hundred yearslater when the Cheshire Railroad was being built, the skeleton was unearthed byaccident.The skeleton was then wired together in the office of Dr. John H. Wells and keptthere. We found the old office of Dr. Wells and learned from the Town History ofWalpole that a Dr. Robbins also shared the office and practice with Dr. Wells.Dr. Artemis Robbins was reported to have then given the skeleton to his family.Dr. Robbins later invested all his savings in railroad stocks that becameworthless and died destitute.We were able to track down the last living relative of Dr. Robbins who wasCaroline Wellington Johonnet, who once lived in Newton, Mass. The Census recordswe found indicated that she was still living at house at least as late as 1945.lyman-simpson-hayes.bmp [../Images/image00451.jpeg]Lyman Simpson Hayes We traveled to the house in Newton, but the family who now resides there did notknow much about Caroline but remembered that there were two old pictures in thebasement. They showed us them and Hugh noticed faint writing on them undetectedby the current owners. The pictures were family Portraits of the Robbins as“Robbins” and “Johonett” were written plainly. This was indeed the lastresidence of the family. We then asked the homeowner if there was anythingstrange in or around the house that would indicate that a skeleton was placedthere. We were told that a strange 8 x 4 foot stone build-out existed in thebasement. We went downstairs and hammered away at the wall to see into the spaceand found that nothing was left in there. Oddly, a good portion of the space hadbeen mortared after the fact and appeared that something was removed from thearea. That was the end of the road for our investigation but this is one of themost compelling accounts we have looked at. This was not a hoax and in fact theskeleton in question belonged to a known giant Native who had double rows ofteeth. This is a fascinating story of a skeleton wired together in the office oftwo prominent physicians but unfortunately now lost.ep3-jim-Rockingham-house.bmp [../Images/image00452.jpeg] Image: After hammering at the wall Jim checks to see if there is a giantskeleton in the cavity. Four Very Large SkeletonsNiles’ Weekly Register, Volume 21, 1822, pg.128Mason County, West Virginia This is one of the earliest reports of double rows of teeth, that comes from theNiles’ Weekly Register, (originally cited in the Kenhawa Spectator). Itdescribes a discovery of “Four very large skeletons”. It goes on to say: “The bones were perfectly sound, and much larger than common, and moreespecially the skulls, which can be very easily slipped over the largest man’shead. The upper jaw bone has one row of double teeth all around, and the underjaw two teeth only on the left side, and no sockets whatever in the rest of thebone were provided by nature for more.” Double Teeth All AroundThe Plough Boy and Journal of the Board of AgricultureVolume 2, J.O. Cole, 1821, pg.239Portsmouth, New Hampshire This early account of a 7-foot giant emphasises that “the upper jaw had doubleteeth all around.”The%20Plough%20Boy%20-%20And%20Journal%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Agriculture%2c%20Volume%202%20%2c%20J.O.%20Cole%2c%201821%20pg%20239.jpg[../Images/image00453.jpeg] Cahokia GiantsThe Saint Louis Dispatch, 1906Cahokia, Illinois This report is repeated from the Giants in the Mounds chapter, but worth puttingin here to emphasize that the mound/pyramid builders were connected to thisphenomenon: “The bones, which instantly crumbled to dust on exposure to the air, appearedlarger than ordinary, while the teeth were double in front as well as behind.” The Strange Story of Benjamin BucklinRhode Island, 1676 Jim and Hugh investigated the strange story of Benjamin Bucklin in episode 6 ofSearch for the Lost Giants. Bucklin was a giant colonial soldier with doublerows of teeth who was killed in a battle along with eight other soldiers nearly350 years ago. Here is the story.The Nine Men’s Misery monument marks the place where on March 26, 1676, nineRhode Island soldiers, including Benjamin Bucklin, were killed by NativeAmericans in King Phillip’s War.King Philip, the chief of the Wampanoag tribe of the Rhode Island/Massachusettsarea of New England, initially succeeded in the battles with the colonists. Oneof the most disastrous military battles for the colonists was called Pierce’sFight, in which most of the colonial soldiers of Pierce’s command were killed.A group of nine of the soldiers escaped the original Indian ambush, but wereseparately later captured, tortured, and killed. Benjamin Bucklin was one of thenine who were killed. The nine bodies were found a day later by a militaryburial mission working on burying the remains of those killed the day before.The remains were buried on the spot on which they were found, a rise of land ina swampy area. Because of the gruesome nature of the torture indicated by thestate of the bodies found by the burial mission, the site became known locallyas the Nine Men’s Misery.The Nine Men’s Misery monument in Cumberland is located in a quiet, dark,uninviting place in the woods, near a former monastery that now has beenreplaced by a public library. The monument—piles of stones cemented togetherwith a cement pillar next to the stone pile, and adorned with a plaque—sits ontop of a hill in what in 1676 was a swampy area. But what was discovered theresheds a new light on the mystery of double rows of teeth and the origins of thisgenetic trait.Through interviews and library research in the Rhode Island area, we were ableto help unravel this story. Here are a few of the numerous accounts we found inthe records, of the exhumation of Bucklin and the fact that he had double rowsof teeth. Providence Journalby James Whitney, Wednesday, January 20, 1886 “When the Whipple estate was in the hands of Mr. Whipple’s father-in-law. ElishaWaterman, Esq. a strange incident occurred in relation to the nine men’s grave.It was either during, or shortly after the Revolutionary War. Some Providencegentlemen, led, it is said, by Dr. Bowen, went up to the place and dug open thegrave. They had already stretched three of the skeletons upon the ground erethey were discovered.When the Cumberland people found out what was going on, ahue and cry being raised, and the farmers assembling from all the region round,the cessation of the robbery was compelled, the disinterment being regarded as afirst-class outrage...One fact was settled by the disinterment, and that was theidentity of the men themselves who were buried. One of the skeletons dug up wasof extraordinary size, and by the fact of it’s having a double set of teeth, wasrecognized as that of Benjamin Bucklin (Buckland), of Rehoboth. It is assuredthus that the men were from other colonies than that of Providence.” Dr. Bowen specifically exhumed Bucklin’s skeleton and verified its enormity andthe fact that he had double rows of teeth. If there is any doubt that Bucklinpossessed this anatomic trait, here are a few more accounts we found. History of AttleboroughJohn Daggett, 1894, pg.115 “…I have seen no notice of this in history, but as to the main fact there can beno doubt. The bones of these men were disinterred (not many years ago) by somephysician for anatomical purposes, and were found nearly perfect. But the peoplein the vicinity insisted upon their being restored, which was accordingly done.One of the slain was ascertained to be a Bucklin, of Rehoboth, from theremarkable circumstances of a set of double front teeth, which he was known topossess.” He goes on to state in finer detail the unfolding mystery and confirmation ofwhat was witnessed. “….The fact that the medical students, from curiosity or to verify thetradition, or other motives, did visit the spot and exhume the bodies, and provetheir identity by that of Benjamin Bucklin (or Buckland), of Rehoboth, from hisunusually large frame and “double set of teeth all around,” has also beensubstantiated. What is still more remarkable than the discovery of the letter,the author met a physician soon after the publication of this history, in 1834,who took pains to state that he had read the account of “Nine Men’s Misery,” andwas able to testify that it was substantially correct, as he was one of the“medical gentlemen” present, and aided in the exhumation and finally examinedthe bones. Having this statement directly from his own mouth, it is personalknowledge of the event, so far as this fact shows.” History of RehobothLeonard Bliss, 1836, pg.198 “Mr. Daggett visited the spot a century and a half after, talkedwith the people then living in the neighborhood, and wrote the story. Hedescribes the spot and the heap of memorial stones piled upon the grave. Thismust have been about 1830. Mr. Daggett in his manuscript told of thedis-interment and about the skull of Bucklin with double teeth, which was thenexhumed. These teeth filled the jaws: there were no “single” teeth…In 1866 Imyself visited the spot and saw it exactly as John Daggett described it: but itis all gone now, having been moved north not less than a mile.” Through communication with members of the Rhode Island Historical Society weable to learn that in the 1920s, the Cistercian monks who lived on the landwhere the soldiers’ remains were buried, did not wish to have unconsecratedremains on their property. They had the remains removed and given to theHistorical Society. We were told that the museum had a box with 9 skulls in it,including Bucklin’s, for 50 years. Strangely, no photos were taken or recordsmade of the skulls. The box of skulls was given to a Mr. Stephen Adams to bereinterred in 1976 for the 300th anniversary of the King Philip’s War battle. Itappears that the skulls were placed in the stone cairn at the Nine Men’s Miserysite. We attempted to gain access to the remains but the fact that it is theoldest Veteran’s Memorial site in the country posed obvious problems. Maybe atsome point we can view the remarkable skull of Benjamin Bucklin and have all theremains buried properly.nine-mens-misery.bmp [../Images/image00454.jpeg] Gigantic Size and StrengthHistory of the Town of Middleboro Mass, Thomas Weston, 1906, p.400Middleboro, Massachusetts Strangely, this account is another case of a giant colonial soldier who foughtin King Philips War as one of Colonel Church’s scouts. Mr. Richmond ofMiddleboro was well known in his time for his enormous size, strength, fightingability, and double rows of teeth: “...A few years ago when the highway was straightened and repaired, remains werefound, and he was re-interred. Afterwards, his body was exhumed in presence ofDr. Morrill Robinson and others to test the truth of the tradition as to hisgigantic size and strength. When the skeleton was measured, it was found thatthe thigh-bone was four inches longer than that bone in an ordinary man, andthat he had a double row of teeth in each jaw. His height must have been atleast seven feet and eight inches.” Where is the Jawbone of Famed Joe Fournier?Owosso Argus Press, February 8, 1972Bay County, Michigan The last report of a giant colonist with double rows of teeth comes from theOwosso Argus Press, February 8, 1972. The article seeks to find the jawbone ofthe Famed Joe Fournier, “who used to keep his teeth sharp by biting hunks out ofbars in backwoods saloons.” Fournier is believed to be the model for theAmerican mythological giant Paul Bunyan. Fournier was killed in a bar roombrawl. The article goes on: “Joe’s skull, which housed his famed teeth, was bashed in by a single blow of acarpenter’s mallet in 1875, ending a boisterous, battling career. One Adolphus“Blinky” Robertson was tried for the crime but was acquitted by a jury. One ofthe interesting parts of the trial was that Fournier’s massive skull wasintroduced as evidence.Old timers tell that the skull was for many years a prized exhibit in the BayCounty Courthouse where its double thick bone and double rows of teeth were themarvel of all who saw it. The jawbone disappeared some time later and wassubsequently reported at the University of Michigan dental school- wherebeginning students used to marvel at the crunch bicuspids. It also was reportedin various museums and even in a couple of bars but no trace of its existencecan be authenticated now.His association with the Paul Bunyan legends came about because of a Detroitnewspaperman, James T. McGillivray had heard in his childhood of the greatstrength and fighting-biting ability of Joe Fournier. McGillivray recalledcampfire stories in the woods of Northern Michigan about Joe Fournier and hisfighting prowess, especially his legendary battle with Silver Jack Driscoll.McGillivray was credited with being the first to mention the name Paul Bunyan inprint, as he mentioned it in his column Round River Drive, in The Detroit NewsTribune in 1910...old timers in the area who were interviewed recalled havingheard tales in their youth of Fournier’s great strength and his rumoredaffiliation with the Paul Bunyan stories. Digging into the story raised thequestion-but did not answer it-where is the jawbone of the famed Joe Fournier?”Paul-Bunyon-pic.bmp [../Images/image00455.jpeg] All three of these Caucasian men all had the same things in common, great size,strength, fighting ability, and double rows of teeth. It would seem illogicalthat numerous people would “marvel” at worn down teeth or an extra tooth or two. Meeting with Dental Anthropologist Dr. Shara Bailey is a dental anthropologist based at New York University (NYU).Hugh visited her as part of the TV series to discuss the phenomenon of doublerows of teeth. Before they met, Hugh sent her several accounts from this chapterto examine. Dr. Bailey was intrigued by the many accounts of duplicated toothrows in North America. She explained that single extra (supernumerary) teeth arerather rare, occurring in 1%-5% of recent populations (but up to 10% in someisolated groups). More than one extra tooth in an individual is even rarer. Itis so unlikely to find full double sets of teeth in human jaws, that shecompared it to finding “a race of three-armed people”. She then explained thatextra sets of teeth would require extra large jaws to accommodate them. This ismost certainly the case as we saw in The Adena Jaw section of the previouschapter. However, making extra teeth is metabolically costly, she said, and shewas skeptical that it would occur so frequently, if at all.Dr. Bailey showed Hugh photographs of individuals that had extra teeth: one fromSouth Africa with an extra tooth (incisor) in the front and a mold fromMelanesia that had extra bicuspids on either side of the lower jaw. However, Dr.Bailey said she had never seen a full set of extra teeth in her twenty years ofstudying dentitions from people from around the world.extra-teeth-mould.bmp [../Images/image00456.jpeg]Mold from Melanesia showing extra bicuspids on either side of the lower jaw. She also found it interesting that many of the reports used the exact samelanguage to describe the individuals, and also felt some reports may have hadsome errors. For example, several accounts of individuals with DRTs describe theteeth as very worn down. Dr Bailey showed Hugh a photo of how severe tooth wearcan look like two sets of teeth to the untrained eye, because the roots show(there are two parts of the roots with each single tooth), therefore this is howthis could have been interpreted. However, in the account from Mason County itclearly describes a two full sets of teeth in the upper jaw, whilst the lowerjaw just had two extra teeth in the left side of the mouth (see p.191).Further investigation of the anomaly revealed that ‘heredity’ could be theorigin of this anomaly,15 with research that links it to genetic throwbacks. Itcould simply be an ancient anatomic deviation that was known around the world inancient times, and due to cross-breeding between different types of human, thesestrange traits then occur (this is explored further in the Origins of the TallOnes chapter). Interestingly, there are numerous accounts of teeth beingdiscovered that were in perfect condition, with no decay or dental problems.Even today, with all the discoveries in dental research, it is almost impossibleto maintain perfect teeth, but they somehow managed it in ancient America asdescribed in this account from 1910: The Dental Summary, Volume 30, 1910, pg.7Fenyville, Wisconsin “C. H. Lawrence of Fenyville, Wis., has exhumed some bones of a prehistoric racefrom mounds near his home. One of the skeletons indicated a man eight or ninefeet tall. Among the collection are three complete jaw bones, in each of whichevery tooth is intact and perfect, except that some are greatly worn, those inone jaw having been shortened to the level of the gums. The teeth in the largerinferior maxillary were in a perfect state of preservation, although the row ofmolars on the left side was considerably worn, indicating that their owner inlife had chewed principally on that side. In none of these teeth are anycavities in evidence, which, together with the fact that none are missing, wouldindicate that the mound building age was a very poor one for dentists.” To further question the phenomenon, a 3,800 year-old skeleton was unearthed with176 other bodies near the Central Valley town of Elk Grove in California, thatshowed signs of acromegaly (over-production of growth hormone), but rather thanthe teeth being more widely spaced apart (which usually happens with thiscondition) the skull exhibited: “...a protruding brow, a lantern jaw, thick leg and arm bones, and teeth socrowded together that at one point they erupt in rows three deep.”16 Skeptics might argue this is what could explain the DRTs in some of theseaccounts, but Dr. Eric Bartelink, a physical anthropologist at California StateUniversity said: “Acromegaly has only been identified definitively at two other archaeologicalsites in North America...in the remains of a male buried in New Mexico about 600years ago, and an unsexed 1,100-year-old skull found in Illinois.” 17 Bartelink noted that the skeleton was only 5 feet 5 inches tall, but the skullshowed advanced signs of hyper-growth in the skull and teeth: “In what seems to have been an unrelated condition, the man’s right eyetoothalso grew upside down, protruding through the bone of his face just under hisnose.” 18 After looking carefully at all possibilities, the phenomenon of double rows ofteeth could either be: 1) Literally two sets of teeth (double)2) molars and premolars in the front of the mouth resembling ‘double’ teeth—anunusual anomaly in itself; 3) supernumerary teeth that are just occasional‘extra’ teeth in the mouth, that could be seen as double sets of teeth, but not‘full sets’. 4) teeth so worn down that only the two roots exist that resembletwo separate teeth.Further investigation clearly needs to be carried out before we can understandthe origins of these unusual traits. Some accounts could be due to the parlanceof the time, but we do find it odd that double rows of teeth are so frequentlylinked with giant skeletons in the historical record.ep5-hugh-shara-bailey.bmp [../Images/image00457.jpeg]Hugh discussing double rows of teeth with Dr. Shara Bailey. "},{"pageContent":"8. The Smithsonian Files The Smithsonian Institution is continually linked to giant skeletons, or atleast the lack of them. Dozens of reports end in something like this: “The boneswere shipped to the Smithsonian Institution for further study”.In this chapter we look at giants skeletons that were sold to the institution,some that were simply given, and even Smithsonian reports of directlydiscovering them. Our favorite report is of the gentleman who refused to sellthem a skeleton! The story of the Smithsonian is remarkable tale that has becomewhat some researchers describe as a “conspiracy”.The Institution was originally founded thanks to just over half a milliondollars (equating to over $13 million today), donated by English scientist JamesSmithson (1765-1829). Due to his unusual will, his fortune ended up being givento the people of the United States in 1836 to found an institution “atWashington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment forthe increase and diffusion of knowledge.”1James_Smithson-1816.bmp [../Images/image00458.jpeg]James Smithson 1816The amount he gave to the U.S. was around 1/66 of the United States’ entirefederal budget at the time.2 President Jackson sent a diplomat to collect themoney that consisted of 104,960 gold coins, but Congress decided to invest themoney in treasury bonds issued by the state of Arkansas. The bonds becameworthless after they defaulted. However, after much debate, ex-President JohnQuincy Adams persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest.Smithson’s reasons for providing for a research and educational institution in anew country on another continent remains a mystery, as he never set foot inAmerica. His bequest sparked widespread debate over what such a nationalinstitution might be. However, once established, “the Smithsonian Institutionbecame part of the process of developing the U.S. national identity.”3 This iscertainly the case, as early pioneers in the newly founded Bureau of Ethnologydrove an agenda of manifest destiny and the new theory of evolution. They alsoexerted control over the prehistoric mounds, and all artifacts and skeletonsdiscovered within them.smithsonian-building.bmp [../Images/image00459.jpeg] In 1864 the Smithsonian was established as a governmental trust to be run by aboard and secretary. Curiously, it is neither governmental or private, sittingin a gray area.The first major Smithsonian publication was created by Ephraim Squire and EdwinDavis. They were commissioned to describe, survey and illustrate the moundculture sites that were being quickly demolished by the incoming Europeans.Their incredibly popular book, published in 1848, did not mention giants, but itconcluded that a prehistoric race, superior to the Native Americans wasresponsible for building the mounds. This became a contentious issue within thehierarchy of the Smithsonian over the decades, and was refuted by futureDirector John Wesley Powell, who was sympathetic towards the Native Americansdue to his interactions with them over the years. Although the lost race theorywas a popular one, it didn’t succeed in becoming part of the new paradigm thatthe Smithsonian was building. To this day, it is official doctrine that themounds were built by the ancestors of the Native Americans, and not a legendarylost race.The publication caused quite a stir, as evolutionary theories and ManifestDestiny were being advanced by Lewis Henry Morgan, John Wesley Powell, and OtisT. Mason. These combined agendas would become the public norm, and influence howmodern Native Americans were being treated for decades to come. “With land rights being one of the foremost issues facinglawmakers, having evolutionary theories that labeled the American Indianpopulations as savage would be seen as a pivotal breakthrough in addressing andadvancing a Manifest Destiny agenda, along with a host of other scientific,government, and social ethnological issues.” 4John_Wesley_Powell_with_Native_American_at_Grand_Canyon_Arizona.jpg[../Images/image00460.jpeg]In 1879 John Wesley Powell (pictured with Pauite Indian) founded the Bureau ofEthnology in a new format. It was set up to be a storehouse of records andartifacts relating to Native Americans, and to transfer archives, records andmaterials relating to the North America Indians from the Interior Department tothe Smithsonian Institution. An annual budget of $25,000 was granted, with$5,000 given to the newly formed Division of Mound Exploration, much to Powell’sdiscontent. As a firm believer in the Native origins of the mounds, he wanted tokeep any research ethnological, not intrusive, but agreed to comply with thebill.John Wesley Powell, who lost his arm in the Civil War, was a famous geologistand explorer (of Grand Canyon exploration fame 1869-1872). His interest inhistory and archaeology stimulated his vision to create the nation’s ultimatestorehouse and research agency. The first annual report was published by theSmithsonian in 1882, under the guidance of Powell. That same year he appointedCyrus Thomas as the Director of the Division of Mound Exploration.CyrusThomasPhotoportrait1.bmp [../Images/image00461.jpeg]Cyrus Thomas Thomas was also quietly a believer in the legendary lost race theory, as by thenhundreds of reports of giant skeletons, strange artifacts that appeared to havecome from other countries, and sophisticated astronomy, geometry, andmathematics were being revealed from the earthworks, regardless of anySmithsonian involvement. The question of who the original inhabitants of NorthAmerica were did not leave the spotlight for too long.Thomas’ organisational skills were put to use in coordinating the field workerswho would go across the country collecting data, artifacts, and most importantlyto our investigation, skulls and skeletons for research and display at theSmithsonian. Many of these discoveries were documented in the Annual Reportsthat we explore later in this chapter. “These [Smithsonian] men were in every valley, on every hill, north and south.They let nothing escape.” 5 He outlined his intentions clearly. The primary goal being: “1. To make a collection of skeletons, especially crania found entombed in themounds or graves.” Cyrus Thomas soon came round to Powell’s views of Native American origins, butthis may have also been the trigger for “the Smithsonian to quash all evidencethat showed that the mound builders were related to any other culture on anycontinent.”6 They also ignored any suggestion of ‘diffusionism’, the school ofthought that believes throughout history there has been worldwide contact viathe oceans and trade routes. Isolationism became the norm, where it is believedto have been isolated from any influence of overseas navigators, or evenneighboring tribes.Aleš HrdličkaAles_hrdlicka.jpg [../Images/image00462.jpeg] In 1910 the Smithsonian hired the most infamous figure in its short history tobe the curator of the Division of Physical Anthropology. Aleš Hrdlička wasinvolved in the Eugenics movement, a pre-Nazism philosophy funded by theRockerfeller Foundation.7 His influence overpowered many contemporaries who wereafraid to challenge the paradigm he was enforcing. We discuss Hrdlička furtherin the chapter, but his draconian zeal, combined with his racist denial ofculturally advanced Native Americans did not help the image of the Smithsonianin the following decades.Author David Hatcher Childress first raised the alarm that something was notright within the Smithsonian in 1993 with his controversial article entitled“Smithsoniangate.”8 It outlined many non-giant related artifacts discoveries atancient sites, that were never heard of again. These included the lost Egyptianartifacts that were said to have been discovered in the Grand Canyon in April1909 with numerous other discoveries. Online skeptics have ridiculed thisarticle as the genesis of the Smithsonian conspiracy theory, but as we delvedinto these upcoming accounts, we quickly found it may prove to be relevant togiantology.A probable urban legend, first written and published by Childress in hisarticle, stated something quite strange and disconcerting, but could it reallybe true? “In a private conversation with a well-known historical researcher (who shallremain nameless), I was told that a former employee of the Smithsonian, who wasdismissed for defending the view of diffusionism in the Americas (i.e. theheresy that other ancient civilisations may have visited the shores of North andSouth America during the many millennia before Columbus), alleged that theSmithsonian at one time had actually taken a barge full of unusual artifacts outinto the Atlantic and dumped them in the ocean.” 9 Before we started this investigation, the Smithsonian was simply just anotherhistorical institution that everyone loved, looked up to, and had some nicemuseums. However, as we uncovered more and more accounts, it quickly becameclear that the Smithsonian collected and received thousands of artifacts,treasures, sizeable skeletons, and amassed an impressive knowledge of America’searlier inhabitants. If there is no ‘conspiracy’, then where are all theserelics now, and why do they deny they received them? Does the scene of thecrated-up artifacts in Raiders of the Lost Ark hold any truth? Ross Hamiltontackles this ongoing issue: “Combing through the Museum’s old Annual Reports has been an education, raisinga number of questions regarding the modern Smithsonian’s repeated denials ofspecific, albeit lacking-in-detail nineteenth century finds. Interestingly,there were few or no such denials until the tenure of Aleš Hrdlička, earlytwentieth century head of anthropology at the Museum. Thus an important—perhapspivotal question is raised: Why would this gentleman discount the existence ofrelics carefully recorded in the field reports of his predecessors John WesleyPowell and Cyrus Thomas? Was Hrdlička simply an apologist ignorant of his ownreliquary’s contents, a rank materialist who had not taken time to search thecollections, or was there something darker creeping insidiously into Americananthropology at the highest levels in the early twentieth century?” 10 Hugh visited the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. in late 2014 to takea look for himself. It is a sparse place, with very few artifacts or anything‘ancient’ on display. It has a cold, unwelcoming atmosphere,and the workers there knew nothing of giant skeletons in their records, eventhough Hugh showed them several examples. Hugh simply saw an empty shell of whatcould have been one of the most important repositories of knowledge in theworld.It’s not all bad though. Their recent court case against the federal governmentover Kennewick Man shows a shift within the ranks, and a new respect for theancestors of this ancient land.The authors are fascinated by these following accounts because they appear toreveal an unfolding agenda and deliberate suppression of what was really beingdiscovered in ancient America, as well as a severe lack of respect for NativeAmerican burials. Other commentators deny there is any cover-up, so please takea look at the following accounts—firstly from newspapers—then from their ownjournals, to determine what really happened at the Smithsonian. Gigantic IndianThe Weekly Democratic Statesman. Austin, Tex. April 12, 1883, Pg.6Bristol, Tennessee This matter-of-fact account is made by John W. Emmert, who unearthed thecontroversial Bat Creek Stone at Bat Creek Mound in Tennessee (see CuriousArtifacts chapter for the full story): “Mr. John W. Emmert, employed by the bureau of ethnology of the SmithsonianInstitution at Washington, has lately explored a mound at Bristol, Tenn., andsecured some interesting and valuable Indian relics. Among other things in themound was found the skeleton of a gigantic Indian.” 14 Human SkeletonsWest Virginia: A Guide to the Mountain State, 1952, pg.448Staunton Park, West Virginia, 1883 Originally in the same year as the above report, this account came out in the1952 book West Virginia: A Guide to the Mountain State:West%20Virginia%20A%20Guide%20to%20the%20Mountain%20State%20%20By%20Federal%20Writers%27%20Project%20%201952%20pg%20448.jpg[../Images/image00463.jpeg] Monster Skulls and BonesNew York Times, April 5, 1886Cartersville, Georgia This news report from The New York Times describes how water receded from theTumlin mound field (now called Etowah mounds) and revealed: “...acres of skulls and bones. Some of these are gigantic. If the whole frame isin proportion to two thigh bones that were found, the owner must have stood 14feet tall.” Also found were ornaments of shell, brass, and stone. It was noted that “Arepresentative of the Smithsonian Institution is here investigating the curiousrelics.” This fact was confirmed by its inclusion in The Smithsonian’s FifthAnnual Report (1887). The Etowah Mound site is just south of CartersvilleGeorgia, and is a 54 acre site that was built and occupied in three phases from1000 to 1550 AD. Etowah has three platform mounds and three lesser mounds.Temple mound A is 63 feet high with a base of 3 acres (pictured below) andoverlooks Temple mound B. This is another wonderfully impressive site from theMississippian era of the Mound Builders. Image: Illustration of the “LargeMound” at Etowah from the Smithsonian’s Fifth Annual Report 1887.5642.png [../Images/image00464.jpeg] Jim uncovered further reports from this mound complex. Two speak of theSmithsonian’s involvement. From the American Antiquarian, 7:52, 1885: “On the stones which covered the vault were carved inscriptions, and these whendeciphered, will doubtless lift the veil that now shrouds the history of therace of people that one time inhabited this part of the American continent. Therelics have been carefully packed and forwarded to the Smithsonian Institute,and they are said to be the most interesting collection ever found in the UnitedStates.” This final account comes from the North Otago Times, July 23, 1884, pg.2, andmentions a “9 ft 2 in” giant.2260.jpg [../Images/image00465.jpeg] These numerous accounts talk of giants with copper crowns, strange carvings andstone vaults from 130 years ago. It seems only obvious to ask where are they allnow? American Antiquarian 1887Volumes 9-10 , Jan. to Nov. 1887, pg.176Crawford, Minnesota “At a depth of 14 feet below the surface, the workmen came upon the skeleton ofa giant, in a tolerable good state of preservation, the skeleton was 8 feet 2inches in length and measured 2 feet 2 inches across the pelvis...At anotherpoint, about six miles from where this skeleton was found, at the mouth of theSioux Coulec one of the agents or employs of the Smithsonian Institute, atWashington, exhumed the remains of another skeleton the size of which wascalculated to be about 9 feet in length.” It seems difficult to imagine putting the bones of a skeleton together and beingseveral feet off in your measurement. Two feet two inches across the pelvis isenormous as well. Indian Relics in West VirginiaThe Baltimore Sun, Jan 23, 1889Romney, West Virginia This is another giant account from Warren King Moorehead who reported unearthinggiant skeletons in several states. Although he did not actually work for theSmithsonian (as the report claims), he was often in contact with them during hisarchaeological explorations. During his time he was a household name, famous forhis work at Cahokia, Etowah, the original Hopewell mound site in Ohio, MaritimeArchaic burial sites in the northeast, and other well known digs. “There has been a great deal of excitement here for several days over thediscovery of Indian relics and remains by Warren K. Moorehead, of theSmithsonian Institution....Eleven skeletons were found in a space of 20 feet,one of them must have been the skeleton of a giant, as the lower jawbone wasalmost twice the ordinary size. The femur was 2 inches larger than a six footman.” Giants Roamed Southern StateSpokane Daily Chronicle, Jun 21, 1933, pg.35Natchez, Louisiana, 1891 Another account revealing “Skeletons of Indians estimated to be more than sevenfeet tall”. Another mention of Smithsonian involvement: “A search for locations for study by members of the Smithsonian institutiondisclosed from 15 to 20 of the skeletons in a grave on a mound at Larte Lake.” This account is from Catahoula Parish, Loiusiana which was also mentioned in the12th Annual Smithsonian Ethnology Report (1890-1891). This included adescription of the Troyville mound site in Catahoula whose dimensions areimpressive, consisting of a mile long earthen wall 7 to 8 feet tall, 20 to 25feet wide, enclosed in an area over 100 acres. The large mound in the enclosedarea was 250 feet long, 160 feet wide at the base, and before it was disturbed,it was 75 feet high. The oldest earthen mound construction started in Louisianawith the creation of Watson Brake in roughly 3400 BC. Biggest Giant Ever KnownThe World, October 7, 1895San Diego, California This fascinating discovery reports on a giant mummy found in San Diego, that ismost likely a hoax. However, lets take a closer look as there is some intrigueand inconsistency with this popular story. This first report appeared in 1895with the sub-headings “Nine Feet High and Probably a California Indian.Measurement Well Authenticated. Other Big Men and Women of Fact and Fable WhoAre Famous Types if Gigantism.” The report continues: “The corpse of the biggest man that ever lived has been dug up near San DiegoCalifornia. At all events there is no satisfactory record in ancient or modernhistory of any human being nearly so tall. The mummy—for in such a condition theremains were found—is that of a person would have been about nine feet high inlife. This makes allowances for the shrinkage, which may be pretty closelycalculated. As to the accuracy in the estimate there can no question, as thecadaver has been carefully inspected and measured by Prof. Thomas Wilson,Curator of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology in the SmithsonianInstitution, and by other scientists. The tapeline even now registers the lengthfrom heel to top of the head at eight feet four inches... The body was found ina cave by a party of prospectors. Over the head are the remnants of a leatherhood. The man was well advanced in years. It has been stated that the man musthave surpassed in height any giant of whom there is an historical record.”2679.png [../Images/image00466.jpeg] Thirteen years later—in 1908—when the mummy was being exhibited, the Smithsonianran some tests and suddenly dismissed it as a hoax, saying it was made from“gelatin”. The fact that it took that long, and after spending $500 to acquireit, plus the fact that it was “carefully inspected and measured by Prof. ThomasWilson, Curator of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology in the SmithsonianInstitution, and by other scientists” thirteen years earlier does suggest theremay be more to this story than meets the eye. Tallest Human Giant Who Ever LivedThe Salt Lake Tribune, June 7, 1908San Diego, California “The mummy of the ‘tallest human giant who ever lived’ was being shown at theAtlantic exposition while, a number of these Smithsonian scientists werethere....The exhibitor agreed to sell it for $500 to the Smithsonian, whichdispatched Mr. Lucas to the scene with, Prof. W. J. McGee. A piece of thegiant’s dried skin was removed and when tested In the chemical laboratory of theSmithsonian was found to be gelatin. Professor McGee Is shown on the left of thegiant, In the accompanying picture, and the exhibitor who was perfectly Innocentof the fraud, is shown on its right.” So in 1908 the Smithsonian claimed that the find was a hoax. Interestingly, AlešHrdlička joined the Smithsonian in 1903, right inbetween the discovery and thefinal debunking. It is interesting to note that the Director of PrehistoricAnthropology, Thomas Wilson, and the ethnologist in charge W. J. McGee were bothinvolved in this story, and were obviously keen to make sure the Smithsonian gotit back to their headquarters at an immense cost ($500 in 1895 equates to$14,285 in todays money). But why would they bother doing that if it was simplya sideshow hoax? The strange twists, and Smithsonian involvement, and theimmense amount of money spent on this makes this worthy of inclusion in thischapter. Bones of Prehistoric Man: Skeleton of Giant Found in a Rude Sepulcher on PineRidgeThe San Francisco Call, August 22, 1897Ukiah, California A strange discovery was made while two men were hunting in a “rudely excavatedhole in a limestone rock”. Several very large bones were found that had beencarefully placed there, and the remains were going to be sent to theSmithsonian. Whether they ever received them is unclear.Giant-sent-to-Smithsonian-The-San-Francisco-call.-August-22-1897-Page-5.jpg[../Images/image00467.jpeg] Finding Skeleton of GiantThe Worthington Advance, November 18, 1897, pg.3Ethnological work of the Smithsonian’s Division of Eastern Mounds This story from Iowa ran in Barton County Democrat and the Nebraska Advertiseron the 19th and 25th of the same month but the original report was from theEvening Star, December 16, 1893. This illustration accompanied all the reports.smithsonian-cartoon-1897.jpg [../Images/image00468.jpeg]The longer article that this story is part of was describing the ethnologicalwork of the Smithsonian Institution’s Division of Eastern Mounds, and quoted theDirector of the Bureau of Ethnology at the time, John Wesley Powell. Thisaccount joins at least 17 other accounts in the Smithsonian Institution’sliterature that reported over seven foot skeletons, that we will explore in thenext section: “It is officially recorded that agents of the Bureau of Ethnology have exploredmore than 2,000 of these mounds. Among the objects found in them were pearls ingreat numbers and some of very large size...It is a matter of official recordthat in digging through a mound in Iowa the scientists found the skeleton of agiant, who, judging from actual measurement, must have stood seven feet sixinches tall when alive. The bones crumbled to dust when exposed to the air.Around the neck was a collar of bear’s teeth and across the thighs were dozensof small copper beads, which may have once adorned a hunting skirt.” Skull Given Museum: Archaeologist Presents Indian Relic to SmithsonianThe Washington Post January 16th, 1910Vancouver Island, British Columbia Captain Newton H. Chittenden, the famous ethnologist, archaeologist and exploreris the focus of this story. Chittenden spent 20 years devoted to ethnologicalresearch for the benefits of governments, society at large and accuracy inhistory. Here is a short biography of Chittenden: “The first white man to explore the interior of the Queen Charlotte Islands,Captain Newton Chittenden was an American lawyer and lecturer who wrote bothpopular and governmental reports. He was a Union Calvary Regiment officer duringthe Civil War who was admitted to the Supreme Court. He also exhibited Indianand Inuit relics in Europe. These he collected while travelling 3,400 miles onburro and foot through the Southwest, Northwest Coast, and Central Plains.”skull-given-museum-1902.jpg [../Images/image00469.jpeg] During his explorations for the government, Chittenden collected a massive skullof a giant. The way he obtained it is somewhat unorthodox, as he had to creep into an Indian graveyard at night and steal the skull, before fleeing back toAmerica. Although touted as a hero, he was simply a thief who stole the skull ofan Indian chief. Not exactly what we would call ‘archaeology’ today. However,the skull was a classic elongated skull that had been deformed by cradleboarding. The tribe were still practicing the cranial deformation technique inthe early 1900s.The article states that he “long treasured it as a priceless possession” and theskull was the “of great interest to European anthropologists who examined it.”He was offered great sums to part with this skull but he ended up donating it tothe Smithsonian Institution. Assistant Director of Anthropology Aleš Hrdličkawhen presented with the skull said it surpassed any previously in theinstitution. In the Sausalito News January 9th, 1904, Chittenden reports that heuncovered another over eight-foot giant in a burial mound in West Berkeley,California. He described the skull as huge and says “I have no doubt that agesago giants roamed around this country”. It is then noted that he presented theskeleton to the Berkeley High School.We find in the Smithsonian’s Annual report of 1911 noted on page 82 of theiraccession list: Chittenden, Capt. Newton H., Brooklyn N.Y., Skull of Flat HeadIndian, two head flattening pillows and the hunting shirt of a half-bloodCree-Indian (51082). Refuses to Sell Skeleton of GiantArizona Journal-Miner ,Oct 13, 1911, pg.3Walnut Creek, Arizona Refuses to Sell Skeleton of Giant reads this surprising headline. This gentlemandecided against selling his discoveries to the Smithsonian, as he sought insteadto give it to an Arizona Museum: “Mr. Shoup was provided with photographic instruments and took several pictures.Mr. Shoup, of the Smithsonian, also desired to take it [the giant skeleton] backto Washington, but this request was held up by Mr. Marx stating that as thesubject was found in the territory it should be kept there. Mr. Shoup (and Mrs.Shoup of the Smithsonian) was very much interested in those portions of thehuman frame that were intact, particularly the skull which indicated that thegiant was of such abnormal size as to be beyond comprehension of that of a humanbeing”.Arizona%20Journal-Miner%20-%20Oct%2013%2c%201911%20pg.3.jpg[../Images/image00470.jpeg] If authentic, one would assume that the photographs should still be in theSmithsonian records. Burial Mound of Giant Race Holds Secret:Thighs and Skulls sent to the SmithsonianSt. Petersburg Daily Times, March 17, 1914, pg.38St. Petersburg, Florida In this account we read. “My friend with a full face of whiskers could easilyslip the jawbone on and off quite easily.” Professor J. H. Pratt of theSouthland Seminary reports finding bones of a 9-footer. He emphasises “theextraordinary size of some of the skulls dug up”. Professor Pratt also worked atthe University of North Carolina and wrote about the mineralogy in the state.st-petersburg-daily-times-mar-17-1914-pg-38%5b1%5d.bmp[../Images/image00471.jpeg]Skull Found Indicates PreviousFloridans were SizeableEvening Independent, February 14, 1925Boca Grande, Florida Once again the Smithsonian is involved in the unearthing of a not-less-than 7 ftskeleton in a shell mound with an unusually large skull, that: “...led to speculation over theories of giant race believed to have inhabitedFlorida before the coming of the Spaniard.” Large skeletons have been reported in shell mounds on both coasts of the US fromFlorida to Maine and up the west coast. Florida once had a massive shell mound75 ft high and Maine once had a 30 ft high shell mound called the WhalebackMound. “The specimens are being prepared for shipment to the Smithsonian Institutewhich already has dispatched one unsuccessful expedition to Florida to excavateshell mounds on the west coast in search of proof of a giant race theory.” Not less than 7 feet, that sounds like a successful attempt to us. Prehistoric Giants Taken from MoundPittsburgh Press, September 13, 1932Near Finleyville and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania “...49 skeletons found, one of a giant nearly eight foot tall, 26 inches acrossthe chest. Some of the bones will be sent to the Smithsonian Institution inWashington for national study.” An Ancient Ozark Giant Dug Up Near SteelvilleThe Steelville Ledger, June 11, 1933Steelville, Missouri As part of the Search for the Lost Giants show, Jim and fellow researcher JamesClary investigated the following account that had this sub-heading: “Strange discovery made by a boy looking for arrowheads, gives this MissouriTown an absorbing mystery to ponder.” Highlights of the lengthy report are given: “It all came about as a result of Billy Harman’s hunt for arrowheads a few weeksago. Poking about in Puckett’s Cave...young Harman reached for something whitein a hole in the ground and, to his vast amazement came up with a handful ofhuman bones. Soundly startled, the 16 year-old lad put them down and dashed forhome. Then, after gathering his courage and some reinforcements, he went backand proceeded to dig on the site of his discovery. From the ancient accumulationof ash and limestone debris he turned up the complete skeleton of an 8 footgiant. The grisly find was brought to Dr. R. C. Parker here and stretched out toits enormous length in a hallway of his office where it has since remained themost startling exhibit Steelville has ever had on public view... An appeal toDr. Aleš Hrdlička, anthropologist of the National Museum in Washington andcelebrated authority on primitive races is expected to help. Dr. Parker haswritten to him, offering to forward the skull or the whole skeleton, ifnecessary , for scientific study... Meanwhile, speculation is proceeding at alively rate. The consensus of local opinion is that these prodigious bones arethe remains of an Indian—maybe and Osage... A corner in the north wall, justwithin the entrance formed the giant’s tomb. The body apparently had been placedin a kneeling position in a shallow grave... Some 13 years ago, Gorard Fowke,field explorer of the Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, spentseveral months investigating these cave-dweller remains... One of his mostastonishing discoveries was evidence that these aborigines were cannibals, foralong with the bones of animals, which they had used for food, he found alsohuman bones, which had been cracked for the extraction of the marrow theycontained. These people, he believed lived at least 1000 years ago.” Jim and James Clary found Puckett’s cave and the general location where the8-foot skeleton was removed along the north wall. They met with severalrelatives of Billy Harmon who all professed to the legitimacy of the find andalso found where R. C. Parker’s office once was, including running into an oldtimer who was a patient of Dr. Parker in his youth.While reading through the microfilm at the Steelville library three reports ofthe find where uncovered including the photo that shows Les Eaton, a 6 ft manlaid out next to the 8 ft skeleton in Dr. Parkers office.The Steelville Ledger also reported that the skeleton was indeed packed up andshipped to the Smithsonian.steelville-1933-edited-microfilm.jpg [../Images/image00472.jpeg] Giants are no More, Declares HrdlickaBerkeley Daily Gazette, March 12, 1934Giants%20NO%20More!%20Berkeley%20Daily%20Gazette%20-%20Mar%2012%2c%201934%20pg%208%20copy.jpg[../Images/image00473.jpeg] In this news report we find the bold pronouncement from the Smithsonian’s headof anthropology Aleš Hrdlička that “Giants Are No More.” Hrdlička was named thefirst Director of Anthropology for the Smithsonian Institution in 1910. Althoughthere were already many giant accounts in the Smithsonian’s own EthnologyReports (and other scientific journals of the time), we are told it wasbasically all a series of mistakes. In the article below he states: “The finder makes a hurried comparison of the length of the fossil thigh bonewith his own, and from this calculates the size of this hypothetical ancientgiant. The person unfamiliar with human anatomy does not know that the upperjoint of the femur is several inches higher than would appear from superficialexamination of the living body.” This explanation does not address the massive amount of reports that are wellout of normal range: 26, 28 and 30 inch femurs, 28, 30, 32 and 36 inchcircumference skulls are routinely reported. It has to be something else andcertainly not an inability to understand how the femur fits into the upperjoint, or how to run a tape measure around a skull.Hrdlička had a couple of other controversial ideas; such as the following,printed in the Science News letter: “the greatest danger before the American people today is the blending of theNegro tenth of the population into the superior blood of the white race.”11 Hrdlička was appointed to the Committee on the Negro, along with Earnest Hootonand fellow pre-Nazi eugenist Charles Davenport. In 1927 their committee endorseda comparison of African babies with young apes, in 1937 Hrdlička also publishedfindings in his American Journal of Physical Anthropology to, “...prove that the negro race is phylogenetically a closer approach to primitiveman than the white race.” Through cranial measurement, Hrdlička concluded that Native Americans along withAfrican Americans were inferior to the white race. As geologist Kirk Bryan toldhis students during the reign of Hrdlička: “if you ever find evidence of human life in a context which is ancient, bury itcarefully but do not forget about it.” 12 One of the reasons Hrdlička might have covered up or marginalized giant skeletalfinds of Native Americans, is because it flew in the face of the field ofEugenics, which correlated cranial size with intelligence. Massive skulls werecertainly not welcome additions to the debate.Hrdlička also zealously believed there was no one inhabiting the US before 2000BC and opposed anyone who questioned this, finally being forced to accept theFolsom finds from the New Mexico site. The Folsom site was excavated in 1926 andshowed 23 bison had been killed using distinctive points called Folsom pointsbetween 8,000 and 9,000 BC. He called Louis Leaky a heretic to his face. He alsomay have taken the same approach to giant skeletal finds and inconvenientartifacts found in Native American burial mounds. He clashed with Warren K.Morehead who reported unearthing giant skeletons in West Virginia, Illinois,Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Morehead’s later writings showed he was becomingincreasingly concerned about the plight of Native Americans. Hrdlička was notalone with his eugenist views at the Smithsonian, surrounding himself with manylike-minded colleagues.Obviously, anthropologists should not be tainted personally by this unfortunatedynamic, but hopefully they can re-evaluate evidence that may have beenmarginalized or excluded from their field. Georgia’s Sand-Dunes Yield Startling Proofof a Prehistoric Race of GiantsThe Portsmouth Times, July 28, 1936Sea Island, Georgia Even though Hrdlička pronounced “Giants No More” two years earlier, they justkept coming back to haunt him. In this account we are told that archaeologistswere “mystified at finding the skeletons of men who were seven feet tall”. Inone photo Dr. Preston Holder points out the “unusual characteristics” of theskeletal finds. The article leads off byinforming the reader of the following: “Perhaps the discovery of dinosaur bones on the North American continent createdno more sensation in scientific circles than the recent revelations ofprehistoric man lately developed off the coast of Georgia.” The Smithsonian Institution sponsored the work and the lead archaeologist wasDr. Preston Holder. Dr. M. F. Seltzer of the United States National Museum wasdispatched to the scene and none other than Aleš Hrdlička examined some of thefirst skulls unearthed by Dr. Holder. The archaeologists used words like“sturdy” and “brawny” in describing the massiveness of the skeletal structure.This particular dig was called The Sea Island Mound Dig at Sea Island, Georgia.It was a WPA (The Works Progress Administration) dig, sponsored by theSmithsonian and took place from May to June 1936 and February to May 1937. TheWPA project numbers were 165-34-3338 and 165-34-8031. Jim read through severalbooks including The Georgia and South Carolina Coastal Expeditions of ClarenceMoore (1998), A New Deal for Southeastern Archaeology by Edwin Lyon (1996), andfinally started to understand all this after reading Shovel Ready Archaeologyand Roosevelt’s New Deal for America by Bernard K. Means (2013). Jim could notfind any mention of unusually large skeletons apart from in the originalwell-detailed article. The following is from Shovel Ready Archaeology andRoosevelt’s New Deal for America : “The history of New Deal archaeology on the Georgia coast has remained obscure,because the foremost archaeologist of the coast, Preston Holder, was notpermitted to publish the major results of his excavations. His superiors at theSmithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., at the Oculmegee National Monumentin Macon, Georgia and at the Works Progress Administration (WPA) offices inSavannah Georgia, did not allow him to publish his highly detailed progressreports and strongly discouraged and effectively prevented him from developing aColumbia University Dissertation on the entire Georgia coast.” 13 Although Dr. Holder, as well as Dr. Seltzer, and Dr. Hrdlička examined andcommented on the evidence, we could find no mention of the giant stature of theskeletons after the initial report. This is in spite of photographs being takenat the site. We did find the following information regarding this episodehowever. Kevin Kiernan, Professor Emeritus of English at the University ofKentucky in his paper, and Preston Holder on the Georgia Coast (1936-1938),informs us: “Very little information is in print about Preston Holder’s extensive, seminal,Works Progress Administration (WPA) era excavations of prehistoric and earlycontact Indian sites on the Georgia Coast, from Savannah to St. Simons Island,between April 1936 and February 1938. For reasons that remain obscure, his WPAsupervisors in Washington (Smithsonian Institution) and Georgia did not permitHolder to publish his work-in-progress, discouraged the use of his results forhis Columbia doctorate, and effectively hid his formal unpublished reports andrelevant papers from scrutiny. In some cases, the supervisors expunged thereports and papers. Under his name, only one meager, two-page note, which wasnever intended for print publication, briefly describes five of the sites thathe excavated in 1936 and 1937 on St. Simons Island.” 14 These are the words of a cautious and respected professor and look at the wordshe chose: “reasons that remain obscure,” “did not permit,” “discouraged,”“effectively hid,” “expunged” and “never intended.” It should be noted thatProfessor Kiernan had many accolades and laureates.15 Smithsonian Gets Huge Indian SkullRochester Journal, October 5, 1936Aleutian Islands, Alaska This is one of several giant finds that occurred in the Aleutian Islands ofAlaska. They are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones,forming part of the Aleutian Arc in the Northern Pacific Ocean, occupying anarea of 6,821 sq miles and extending about 1,200 miles westward from the AlaskaPeninsula toward the Kamchatka Peninsula.Hrdlička personally unearthed this oversized skull two years after pronouncing“Giants are No More.” Let us look at a quote from Ross Hamilton. who discussesHrdlička in his A Tradition of Giants:2625.png [../Images/image00474.jpeg]“It is hardly beyond the scope of an overly ambitious man and a cooperative(perhaps intimidated) staff to have cleaned house of a surplus of challengingartifacts in view of the political problems attending such evidence. Like theecclesiastical editorship of the Constantine era, when a group of eliteresearchers believe themselves to be a sort of priestcraft charged withpreserving the truth, much that would question their wisdom is inexplicablyunobtainable. We do not know what treasures have laid in the private vaults ofthe Vatican, and a similar inscrutability is inherent with the Smithsonian. Aninstitution selecting its executive staff by private appointment, we are left toassume the anthropology division of the National Museum is one of the last goodold boys clubs still influencing the national psyche in a questionable sense. Wewonder why there is no one there to engage a whistle-blowing operation.”Hrdlicka-Skull-Card.jpg [../Images/image00475.jpeg] Image: Official Smithsonian catalogue card of skull that Dr. Hrdlička discoveredin 1936 Smithsonian Amazed at Discovery of6 ½ -foot Mummies in CavesThe Washington Post, July 22, 1937Sonora, Mexico This is a teaser of a later chapter and is a very interesting story examiningthe explorations of Paxson Hayes in Sonora, Mexico, and the involvement of theSmithsonian: “Paxson C. Hayes and Gerald C. Barnes....have found traces of an extinct race ofMexican giants... Smithsonian officials agreed Hayes and Barnes had somethingthere, but weren’t sure what it was.” The taller than average mummies are part of a controversial story we investigatefully in the Giants of Sonora, Mexico chapter. The largest skull ever recorded isDiscovered by ArchaeologistThe Washington Post, June 24, 1937Potomac Creek, Stafford County, Virginia A gigantic skull was found by archaeologist and presiding judge W. J. Graham ofthe United States Court of Custom and Patents Appeals. He found the enormousspecimen in Stafford County, Virginia, the site of many other giant skeletonfinds. All his finds were sent to the Smithsonian. Judge Graham was astoundedafter he saw it mounted and said, “it looked almost as big as a watermelon.”This would be a correct assumption as it had a cranial capacity of 2100cc. Theone on the left is an average human skull and the one in the middle, is “aboveaverage.”Virginia-big-skull.jpg [../Images/image00476.jpeg]He also estimated that its owner must have had a hat size over eight. It wasalso recorded in the Smithsonian accession records as can be seen below:16Graham-Skull-Card.jpg [../Images/image00477.jpeg]Aleutian Grave Holds Bones of GiantToledo Blade April 27th, 1944, pg.8Aleutian Islands, Alaska The report describes the discovery of a giant “at least seven feet tall. Thebodies were arranged in a geometric pattern like “spokes of a wheel.” Thesefinds may have a possible connection to this following story recorded by DavidHatcher Childress about an episode in the Aleutians. This is an often-told taleabout possible skullduggery: “Ivan T. Sanderson, a well-known zoologist and frequent guest on Johnny Carson’s‘Tonight Show’ in the 1960s (usually with an exotic animal—a pangolin or alemur), once related a curious story about a letter he received regarding anengineer who was stationed on the Aleutian island of Shemya during World War II.While building an airstrip, his crew bulldozed a group of hills and discoveredunder several sedimentary layers what appeared to be human remains. The Alaskanmound was in fact a graveyard of gigantic human remains, consisting of craniaand long leg bones. The crania measured from 22 to 24 inches from base to crown.Since an adult skull normally measures about eight inches from back to front,such a large cranium would imply an immense size for a normally proportionedhuman. Furthermore, every skull was said to have been neatly trepanned (aprocess of cutting a hole in the upper portion of the skull). In fact, the habitof flattening the skull of an infant and forcing it to grow in an elongatedshape was a practice used by ancient Peruvians, the Mayas, and the FlatheadIndians of Montana. Sanderson tried to gather further proof, eventuallyreceiving a letter from another member of the unit who confirmed the report. Theletters both indicated that the Smithsonian Institution had collected theremains, yet nothing else was heard. Sanderson seemed convinced that theSmithsonian Institution had received the bizarre relics, but wondered why theywould not release the data. He asks, “...is it that these people cannot facerewriting all the textbooks?” Smithsonian Reports The following accounts are all official Smithsonian documents and reports ofexcavations from their series of annual reports. Image: The Fifth (1887) andTwelfth (1894) Smithsonian Annual Reports. Both feature numerous giant accounts.smithsonian-books-jims.bmp [../Images/image00478.jpeg] Annual Report of the Board of Regents of theSmithsonian Institution for the year 1873 (pg.418)Anna, Union County, Illinois This account from a burial mound in Illinois is truly remarkable. It wasrecorded by T. M. Perrin when excavating various mounds and earthworks in thearea (see Anatomic Anomalies chapter for further details): “The skulls are very large but fall to pieces on being exposed to the air. Oneskull was found that would have measured 36 inches in circumference.” Annual Report of the Board of Regents of theSmithsonian Institution for the year 1875 (pg.392)Amelia Island, Florida In this early Smithsonian report, there is a description of a giant skeletonbeing unearthed with an enormous skull, double rows of teeth and a giant axe.(See earlier reference in DRT Chapter.) Dr. Augustus Mitchell states: “Anticipating a perfect specimen in this skull, I was doomed to disappointment;for, after taking it out of the earth and setting it up, so that I could viewthe fleshless face of this gigantic savage, in the space of about two hours itcrumbled to pieces, except small portions. According to the bones of thisskeleton, its height must have been quite seven feet.” Annual Report of the Board of Regents of theSmithsonian Institution for the year 1877 (Pg.260)Kishwaukee Mounds, Illinois In this official report it describes “stone hatchets, axes, and skinning stones”being found at the Kishwaukee Mounds in Illinois. However, a ten-pound axe isalso discussed, followed by this: “...but the largest one in this section is in Dr. Everett’s collection. Itweighs one ounce over 15 pounds; is of dark colour; the shape is artistic; theexternal boundary lines are all graceful curves. Only a giant could have wieldedit.”And:“One of them was in the grave of a giant, for a large man could pass the jawbonearound his face and the thigh bone was four inches longer than that of a man sixfeet two inches high.” (pg.274) Further on we find: “It was found lying in a grave by the side of a hugeskeleton, much taller than the current race of men”.(pg.276) Fifth Annual Report of The Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution1883-1884 (Pub. 1887) Thanks to Greg Little and Andrew Collins, authors of Path of Souls (2014), forresearching these following accounts that mention “large” or “extremely largeskeletons” in the Smithsonian’s Fifth Annual Report: Wisconsin. A large mound in Sheboygan County yielded a “large” skeleton (pg.19). West Virginia. At the Smith farm in the Kanawha Valley, a “large skeleton” wasrecovered (pg.52). At a lower level in the same mound, another skeleton, 7 ft 6in, was found (pg.52). Another mound (#7) in the same area yielded a 7 ftskeleton (pg.56). Two “very large skeletons” were found in the Poor House orInstitute Mound (pg.57). North Carolina. The Nelson Mound yielded a 7-foot skeleton (pg.62). The JonesMound, not too far from the Nelson, also yielded a “very large” skeleton(pg.67). Georgia. Etowah Mound: A 7-foot skeleton was found(pg.98). Cyrus Thomas concluded the report with an article called Burial Mounds of theNorthern Sections of the United States, that showed a clear shift from hisinitial stance that a legendary lost race were responsible for the mounds: “...there is nothing found in the mode of constructing these mounds, nor in thevestiges of art they contained, to indicate that their builders had reached ahigher culture status that that attained by some of the Indian tribes foundoccupying the country at the time of the first arrival by Europeans.” (pg.108) This was the beginning of the end of the lost race discussion that had beengoing on for decades. Whether they related this to the stream of massiveskeletons that were being uncovered is not clear, as further taller-than-averageexamples were continuously being unearthed and recorded, most notably in theTwelfth Annual Report of 1894, that covered excavations ranging from 1882 to1891. Twelfth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology ofthe Smithsonian Institution, 1894 (pg.113)Dunleith Mounds, East Dubuque, Illinois The Twelfth Annual Report has become a mecca for giantologists, for reasons thatwill soon become clear. John Wesley Powell summarized the intention of thereport when he wrote in the introduction “The most important question to besettled is, ‘were the mounds built by the Indians?’”(pg.21). This one describesthe opening of burial mounds in Dunleith, Illinois, that was also reported onpage 35 of the Fifth Annual Report: “No. 5, the largest of the group carefully examined. Two feet below the surface,near the apex, was a skeleton, doubtless an intrusive Indian burial. Near theoriginal surface of the ground, several feet north of the center, were the muchdecayed skeletons of some 6 or 8 persons, of every size, from infant to theadult. Near the original surface, 10 or 12 feet from the center, on the lowerside, lying at full length upon its back, was one of the largest skeletonsdiscovered by the Bureau agents, the length as proved by actual measurementbeing between 7 and 8 feet. It was clearly traceable but crumbled to piecesimmediately after removal from the hard earth it was encased.” Twelfth Annual Report (pg.117)Welch Mounds, Pike County, Missouri “The earth of the main portion of this mound was very fine yellowish sand whichshoveled like ashes and was everywhere, to the depth of from 2 to 4 feet, asfull of human skeletons as could well be stowed away in it, even to two andthree tiers. Among these were a number of bones not together as skeletons, butmingled in confusion and probably from scaffolds or other localities. Exceptingone, which was rather more than seven feet long, these skeletons appeared to beof medium size and many of them much decayed.” The report also stated “Anotherwas of extraordinary size”Collins and Little spotted further mentions of “large skeletons”: Mississippi. In Union County at the Ingomar Mounds, a “large skeleton” was found(pg.273). Georgia. At Etowah, the 7-foot skeleton described in the earlier Bureau reportwas again cited (pg.302). Twelfth Annual Report, 1894 (pg.335)Nelson Mound, North Carolina “No. 16 was an unenclosed “squatter” of unusually large size, not less thanseven feet high when living.” Two skeletons of “large stature” were found in the nearby Nelson Triangle(pg.336). Twelfth Annual Report, 1894 (pg.362)Long Island, Roane County, Tennessee “The length from the base of the skull to the bones of the toes was found to be7 feet 3 inches. It is probable, therefore, that this individual when living wasfully 7 ½ feet high. At the head lay some small pieces of mica and a greensubstance, probably the oxide of copper, though no ornament or article of copperwas discovered. This was the only burial in the mound.”Twelfth Annual Report, 1894 (pg.419)Kanawha Valley, West Virginia From a mound in the Spring Hill Enclosure, West Virginia it is reported: “...among the decayed fragments of bark wrappings, lay a skeleton fully 7 feetlong, extended at full length on the back, west.” Twelfth Annual Report, 1894 (pg.426)The Great Smith Mound, West VirginiaOn page 426 it describes the opening of a burial mound in Kanawha County, WestVirginia by Professor P. W. Norris of the Smithsonian. This find was alsoreported in The New York Times and several other places: “At the depth of 14 feet a rather large human skeleton was found, which was in apartially upright position with the back against a hard clay wall. All the boneswere badly decayed, except those of the left wrist, which had been preserved bytwo heavy copper bracelets...Nineteen feet from the top the bottom of thisdebris was reached, where, in the remains of a bark coffin, a skeleton,measuring 7 ½ feet in length and 19 inches across the shoulders was discovered.Each wrist was encircled by six heavy copper bracelets.”Twelfth%2c%201894%20pg%20426.bmp [../Images/image00479.jpeg] Professor Norris’ handwritten notes about the excavations at Smith Mound areincluded. The highlights of his original notes make clear matter-of-factstatements about giant skeletons. The authors acquired these notes thanks toresearcher Josh McGraw’s diligent efforts. We believe they are important becausethese were Norris’ first impressions of the dig. Here are a selection of themthat stood out: pg.47: “Human skeleton - gigantic 1, large 1.”pg.55: “...only nearly decayed fragments of a large human skeleton.”pg.56: “Gigantic human skeleton (?).”pg.57: “...decayed skeleton (less the cranium which certainly had never beenplaced there) of a very large human being”pg.59: “The cranium (which is of the Peruvian type) together with the lower jaware sent to the Bureau...was found a very large human skeleton too (?) decayedfor excavation.”pg.63: “...anything of interest save the (?) above mentioned which had beenmissed near the head of the giant.”pg.64: “...the bones of the giant.”pg.81: “2 very large human skeletons in a sitting posture.”McGraws%20notes-edited.bmp [../Images/image00480.jpeg] Below are some further accounts from the Twelfth Annual Report collected byLittle and Collins: West Virginia. “Two very large skeletons” were found in Mound 31 (Institute, orPoor House Mound) in the same grouping as described above (pg.432). “Many largeskeletons” were found in rock mounds nearby (pg.436). In the nearby McCullochMound was another “very large skeleton” (pg.437). Another “very large skeleton”was excavated from Barboursville, Virginia (pg.440). Ohio. Stone graves near Ripley, Ohio, yielded two “extremely large skulls” and“long femur bones” but no complete skeletons (pg.453). Coshocton County, Ohio. A stone box grave with a 7 ft long skeleton was found(pg.458) Pennsylvania. The remains of one “large size adult’ were found in McKees RocksMound (pg.495). The report recorded over 40,000 artifacts and countless skeletal remains. Over2,000 mounds were excavated during the timeframe of this report (1882 - 1891).Powell concluded “the author believes that the theory which attributes theseworks to the Indians....to be the correct one.”17Although there are clearly numerous accounts of taller-than-average skeletons,neither Powell or Thomas (who wrote the concluding remarks in the 1894 report)mention them once. They are simply ignored. Why would they do this, especiallyat a time when hundreds of giant skeletons were being reported in Americannewspapers, in town and country histories, and by their own Smithsonianemployees?They also both dismissed any and every theory of overseas ancient culturesvisiting America, and made a point to put an end to the lost race theory. Italmost certainly appears they linked the giant skeletons with the enigmatic lostrace that Cyrus Thomas had firmly believed in previously. Whether he simply cameto his senses based on his years of research and analysis, or whether theparticularly demanding Powell influenced him in some way, is not clear. Powellwas known as a very insistent and strict employer.Some of these skeletons the Smithsonian discovered were remarkably tall (up to 8feet), yet they have all gone missing or have been taken away by NAGPRA. Nomatter what Powell or Thomas thought about these reports, it is very tellingthat they did not mention any of the taller-than-average skeletons in theirfinal words.These reports leave a very intriguing legacy for our generation to ponder. Thewritten word constitutes a powerful record of what came before us, and for thedirectors of one of the worlds leading institutions to ignore or deliberatelysuppress their own writings and research—as well as the hundreds of newsreports—leaves us to conclude that their were forces gathering at the nationalmuseum that signalled an end to the true legacy of ancient America.Sioux-Full-Blood-Accession-Card.jpg [../Images/image00481.jpeg] Image: Example of a Smithsonian accession card of “Sioux, full blood” withdimensions as “Giant.” "},{"pageContent":"9. Curious Artifacts Unusual artifacts were often reported along with giant skeletons all over NorthAmerica. Extra large tools and weapons, tablets with peculiar writing, metalartifacts, mysterious ancient coins and medallions, and even an ancient gun. Allthese out-of-place-artifacts are described in the following accounts. Strange Inscriptions The Grave Creek TabletGrave Creek Mound, Moundsville, West Virginia, 1838 The Grave Creek Mound is discussed in detail in the Giants at Ancient Siteschapter. It was built by the Adena culture between 300-150 BC1 and when the62-foot mound was opened in 1838, a strange tablet with curious writing was saidto have been unearthed with skeletal remains in a stone-arched vault. Variousaccounts report that giant skeletons were found.2 J. P. MacLean, best known for his 1893 book The Mound Builders, said this on thematter:2871.png [../Images/image00482.jpeg] “It was in this vault that the inscribed stone was found on the 16th of thefollowing June. From a letter written to Mr. P. P. Cherry, March 7th, 1878, byMr. Tomlison, it would appear that the stone was found at the end of a seconddrift which was excavated from the side of mound to the upper vault. Afterstriking the second vault the men from the first vault drilled upward until thesecond fell to the bottom.” 3 MacLean included a letter dated June 19th 1879, from Colonel James E. Wharton,who was present when the stone was found: “On going to the end of the drift we found some debris, and a man or two atwork, and another...wheeling out the dirt that seemed to have fallen...We wentout and lazily engaged in hauling over the dirt for curiosities, some few ofwhich we found.” 4 The letter continues explaining that they carefully sifted through the dirtlooking for artifacts, and a man who was working there handed them the tabletthat was still covered in dirt. This obviously raises alarms as it was not clearif it was found that day. However, it was said to look worn and ancient and itwas covered in mud, although the authenticity has been speculated upon eversince. Wharton had no doubt it was genuine: “The letters were not all Phoenician, showing that the one who cut them had beenlong mingling with others, and his language had been corrupted. Whereas a fraudwould naturally have copied all the letters from the published alphabet; theornament on it is well proportioned showing that the maker was accustomed toseeing what he copied. There was no motive for the fraud, no one anywhere in theregion who could have made it if he would, and few frauds of the kind have beenheard of.” 5Multiple suggestions of the inscription’s origins have been put forward sinceits discovery,6 but the initial interpretation of it being a corruptedPhoenician alphabet is intriguing. The Phoenicians were also known as theCanaanites, who originated in the area of modern day Syria, Lebanon and Israel.This ancient holy land was known for its historical giants, that we will take alook at in the final chapter.Harvard epigrapher Barry Fell also suggested it was Punic (Phoenician), usedalong the Iberian Peninsula in the 1st millennium BC. It reads from right toleft and translates as: 1. The mound raised-on-high for Tasach2. This tile3. (His) queen caused-to-be-made 7 Barry Fell explained: “The alphabet of the tablet was deciphered by Spanish scholars, and published byEnglish epigrapher D. Diringer in 1968. The basic language is Semitic, and allwords occur in standard literary Semitic dictionaries.” 8 The original is now lost but there are some molds of it in the Smithsonian andone in the museum at the site in Moundsville. A stone with similar inscriptions called the ‘Wilson-Braxton Tablet’ wasdiscovered in 1931 in a stream bed in central West Virginia. It was originallythought to be of Viking origin, but Fell, using the same techniques he used onthe Grave Creek Stone, with lettering found in standard Semitic dictionaries,translated it to read: 1. The memorial of Teth2. This tile3. (His) brother caused-to-be-made 9wilson-braxton-tablet-1931.bmp [../Images/image00483.jpeg]If these curious tablets are genuine, they leave some tantalising clues as tothe origins of the Mound Builders. The Brush Creek TabletMuskingum County, Ohio, Brush Creek Township, March 3, 1880Thankfully this image is still in existence, for the original has gone missing.The following is a letter from the men who excavated the mound where the tabletand numerous skeletons were reportedly found. The content is carefully andthoughtfully documented and is the sworn testimony of the five men involved inthe find. Ross Hamilton believes that the skeletons buried in the Brush CreekMound were the truly ancient “Tall Ones” and that the out-of-placesugar-loaf-shaped mound quite possibly was one of the oldest in the countrybefore it was destroyed. Ross also believes that the couples were the breedingelite and were ceremonially put to death by their own people, so they did notfall into the hands of an invading enemy - the Lenape.Brush-Creek-Tablet.jpg [../Images/image00484.jpeg] To Dr. F. T. Everhart Historian “Dear sir, on December 1, 1879 we assembled with a large number of people forthe purpose of excavating into and examining the contents of an ancient mound,located on the farm of Mr. J. M. Baughman, in Brush Creek Township. The mound issituated on the summit of a hill, rising 152 feet above the bed of the streamcalled Brush Creek. It is about 64 feet in width by about 90 feet in length,having an altitude of 11 feet 3 inches; is nearly flat on top. On the mound werefound the stumps of 16 trees ranging in size from 8 inches to 2 and a half feetin diameter. We began the excavations by digging a trench four feet wide fromthe east side....At this juncture work was abandoned on account of the latenessof the hour, until Monday December 8th when it was resumed by opening the moundfrom the Northwest. When at the depth of seven and a half feet in the northtrench, we came upon two enormous skeletons, male and female, lying one abovethe other, faces together, and heads toward the west. The male by actualmeasurement, proved to be nine feet six inches, the female eight feet nineinches in length. At about the same depth in the west trench we found two moreskeletons, lying two feet apart, faces upward and faces to the east. These, itis believed were full as large as those already measured but the condition inwhich they were found rendered exact measurement impossible.On December 22nd we began digging at the southwest portion of the mound, and hadnot proceeded more than three feet when we discovered an altar made of sandrock. The altar was six feet in width and twelve feet in length, and was filledwith clay, and of about the same shape that the mound originally was.Immediately behind or west of the altar, were found three skeletons, lying facesupwards heads toward the south, measuring, respectively: eight feet ten, ninefeet two and nine feet four inches in length. In another grave a female skeletoneight feet long and a male skeleton nine feet four inches long- the female thelowermost, and the face downward, and the male on top face upward, behind thesite of the altar.After proceeding about four feet, we found, within three feet of the top of themound, and five feet above the natural surface, a coffin or burial case, made ofa peculiar kind of yellow clay, the like of which we have not found in thetownship, consequently, we believe it was brought from a distance. Within thecasket were confined the remains of a female eight feet in length...We havefound 11 human skeletons in all... The above report contains nothing but factsbriefly told and knowing that the public has been humbugged and imposed upon byarchaeologists, we wish to fortify our own statements by giving the followingtestimonial. We the undersigned citizens of Brush Creek Township, having beenpresent and taken part in the above excavation, do certify that the statementsherewith set forth our true and correct, and in no particular has the writerdeviated from the facts in the case. Signed Thomas D. Showers, John Worstall,Marshall Cooper, J.M. Baughman , S.S. Baughman, John E. McCoy.” This account is detailed with meticulous measurements of everything, includingthe skeletons. Ross Hamilton commented on this: “At the bottom of the three-page account, the signature of six citizens wasaffixed in an affidavit verifying the truth, correctness, and non-deviation fromthe facts. It is quite possible that these people reported on something a bitrarer than ever expected. The mounded structure was possibly Archaic Allegheny.”10 Giant in Ancient Mound: Curious Relics of Prehistoric Times is Found in the TombThe Washington Post, June 23, 1908Huntington, West Virginia This caught our attention because it is in the vicinity of Grave Creek Mound inMoundsville and a similar inscribed tablet is mentioned. It also included copperbracelets found with a “massive” skeleton. Unfortunately the mound is now gone,and only the written word of what was reported still exists: “The municipal authorities of Central City, four miles west of here, three weeksago ordered the removal of a prehistoric mound from Thirteenth street. Todaytwelve feet above the base of the mound a gigantic human skeleton wasdiscovered. It is almost seven feet in length, and of massive proportions. Itwas surrounded by a mass of rude trinkets. Eight huge copper bracelets werediscovered. Thus, when burnished, proved to be of purest beaten copper and aperfect preservation. Rude stone vessels, hatchets, and arrowheads were foundwith the skeleton. A curiously inscribed totem was found at the head of theskeleton. The Smithsonian Institution will be notified of the discovery.” Discovery of Ancient Tomb of Aztec Man -Remarkable Find of Aboriginal Giant‘Artisans and Artifacts of Vanished Races’by Theophilus L. Dickerson, 1915, pg.151Alcinda, Indiana “Some workman while digging in a piece of hilly woodland discovered a curiouslyshaped stone that extended about four feet below the surface and bearing strangehieroglyphic characters. Curiosity prompted the workmen to remove this stonecover from the vault, which was found to be circular in shape. The stone coverwas six inches in thickness. In the stone grave was the remains of a skeletonapproximating the stature of a giant, and in primitive times no doubt heoccupied a commanding position, judging from the care that had been given inbuilding a stone sepulcher and the metal and stone ornaments found about thisprehistoric human skeleton. The copper ornaments on this aboriginal giant almostcover the skeleton. The characters on the stone cover resemble the phonetic orqueer hieroglyphic symbols on the stones of Aztec ruins in Mexico, CentralAmerica and Yucatan.” Virtually every report we have seen with strange hieroglyphic writing has alsocome with a report of a giant skeleton being found. We might surmize that thegiants were affiliated with a literate mentality. It is a curious thing indeed. Ancient Metallurgy The Great Lakes area was once a busy copper mining area that goes back to atleast 5000 BC.11 It has been estimated that millions of pounds of copper ore wasmined in the region, although most of it seems to be no longer be in NorthAmerica. In this section we look at reports of metals being found with oversizedskeletons, not only in the Great Lakes region, but across the country and evenin Canada. Inscribed Copper BreastplateThe Stark County Democrat, Ohio, May 14, 1874Labrador, Canada This account from Canada relays a tale of a stone cairn that yielded a brassshield and breastplate. The article reads, “Dr. McHenry, of Quebec, who spent last summer in Labrador, writes to theArchaeological Weekly that he found many important evidences of the presence ofthe Northmen in that peninsula, on the banks of the river Moisie and in theregions frequented by the Nasquapee Indians. One cairn in particular, the stonesof which were so heavy as to defy the assaults of Indians or bears, he forcedopen with gunpowder, and found in it a gigantic human skull, breastplate andbrass-bound shield. The breastplate, though much rusted, bore signs of aninscription or legend, failing to decipher which, he sent it to Copenhagen tosee if it could be made out by the American archaeologists there.”Timucua_warriors_with_weapons_and_tattoo_regalia.jpg [../Images/image00485.jpeg] Gigantic Skeleton of a ManThe New York Sun, August 27, 1891Salt Lake City, Utah This account yields another out-of-place-artifact from Utah: “The gigantic skeleton of a man, measuring 8 feet 6 inches in height, was foundnear the Jordan River, just outside Salt Lake City last week. The find was madeby a workman who was digging an irrigation ditch. The skull was uncovered at adepth of eight feet from the surface of the ground, and the skeleton wasstanding upright. The workman had to dig down nine feet in order to exhume it...A copper chain, to which was attached three medallions covered with curioushieroglyphics, was around the neck of the skeleton, and near it were found astone hammer, some pieces of pottery, an arrowhead and some copper medals.Archaeologists believe that the original owner of the skeleton belonged to therace of the mound builders.” The Catholic Church in the Niagara PeninsulabyWilliam R. Harris 1626 -1895, pp.19-20Niagara, New York State We are informed that Dr. Reynolds unearthed 20 skeletons “one third larger thanthe Iroquois or Huron”, 15 feet down at the head of the Gallops Rapids on theRiver St. Lawrence: “Remains of earthenware, pieces of copper, and instruments of rude workmanshipwere ploughed up within the area...Some of the skeletons were of giganticproportion. The lower jaw of one is sufficiently large to surround thecorresponding bone of an adult of our generation.” We find the mention of a mound in Orleans County, New York that yielded: “...skeletons of giant size, pieces of pottery and earthenware, covered withpatterns in relief, wrought with great skill.” We also are informed that in 1809, three and a half miles from Aurora, New York,a copper plate that was sixteen inches long and twelve inches wide was ploughedup: “Upon it were engraved characters extending its whole length, which have not yetbeen deciphered.” It even describes where they were mining for the copper: “In 1847, prospectors of the Minnesota Mining Company discovered an abandonedmine, in which were found ladders, masses of broken rock, tools and implements,proving that the mine had been opened and worked by a race of men who knew thevalue of copper for decorative, ornamental and other purposes.” Ceremonial Axes of CopperSeip Mound and Hopewell Group, Ross County, Ohio, 1902 A large copper axe was unearthed at Seip Mound, Ross County, Ohio, while an evenlarger example was found by Warren K. Moorehead at the Hopewell Group site. Theyare generally believed to be ceremonial, rather than practical. The Seip Moundaxe weighed 27 pounds (12.25 kg) and the larger one was 38 pounds (17.25 kg).Other examples were also discovered: “Many of these rare objects were found by Moorehead in the central mound of theHopewell Group, by the writer in another mound of the same group, by Mills inthe mound City Group, and by McKern in the Wisconsin Hopewell Mounds. Some ofthe longest of these measure as much as 18 inches, with a width of six inches ormore.” 12seip-mound-axe-heads.jpg [../Images/image00486.jpeg] Mound Giants in Indiana Said to Antedate IndianThe News, October 23, 1925, pg.6South Bend, Indiana This account is about the unearthing of eight skeletons in a burial mound: “The eight skeletons lay in circular formation, arranged like the spokes of awheel, with skulls together. Copper breastplates, bands and other bits of armoradorned the skeleton of one man, who apparently had been of giant stature.Embedded in this skull was a beautiful chipped flint arrowhead.”indiana-The%20News%2c%20October%2023%2c%201925%20page%206.jpg[../Images/image00487.jpeg] Grove Vosburg, the 70-year-old farmer on whose land the burial mound resided,had always wondered about its contents and secretly dug into it. Many intricateartifacts were found: “Three pounds of ore, believed to be either silver or white gold, lie with thebones. There were corroded copper bands, which antiquarians here believe wereused to bind war clubs; two pipe bowls, one of smooth black stone and the othercarved with the replica of a fantastic monster, were found.” Once again the skulls were said to have been of a strange type with a “littleforehead and the eye cavities are high in the head”.Spokes of a wheel, strange skulls, copper armor and giant skeletons; our guessis that Mr. Vosburg was not spinning a tall tale.These next account shows that the ancient giants also had a fondness for silver. Very Old InhabitantsThe Weekly Kansas Chief, October 29, 1874 pg.1Battle Creek, Michigan In this special telegram to the Chicago Times we have a strange account about alost silver breastplate with unusual inscriptions, although this may well havebeen from early Spanish settlers, as silver was not mined or produced inAmerica: “...twenty-two skeletons were found, sitting upright, face to face in a circle.A number of arrowheads, stone pipes and hatchets were found with the skeletons;also a silver breast plate covered with curious inscriptions. This plate wassold to a young man for $10, who has since moved away, and our archaeologistsare now endeavoring to get trace of it...The most remarkable part of thediscovery was the size of the skeletons. They were giants and averaged fromseven to eight feet in height. The lower jaw of any of them could be fitted withthe greatest ease over a man’s face. The teeth were perfectly preserved and verylarge...Old settlers say that when they came into the country the Indians,although they had a burial place nearby, had no knowledge of these old moundsand said that they were built before the recollection of their forefathers.” Oversized Axes The following reports of gigantic axes are often considered to be ceremonialobjects, but the reality is that many show signs of wear, and are oftentimesreported with enormous skeletons, suggesting thay may have indeed been wieldedand used by these ancient giants. A Giant Mummy :The Body that of a Man Eight Feet TallL. A. Times, Nov. 7, 1896, pg. 1Elkwell Creek, Kentucky This rare giant mummy from Kentucky is reported along with a giant axe foundwith the burial: ”While digging a cellar near Elkwell Creek, John Winter excavated a giant mummyand discovered several interesting relics of great value. The find has createdexcitement here and crowds are flocking to the scene. The mummy is that of a manof great stature, being over eight feet tall. It was wrapped in a winding sheetof skins and carefully sealed in a canoe shaped coffin. In a few minutes afterbeing exposed to the air, the mummy commenced to crumble away, but by carefulhandling Winter has succeeded in keeping intact his remarkable discovery. At thehead of this prehistoric giant was a tremendous stone ax, only such as couldhave been wielded by a man of wonderful strength. It is a formidable lookinginstrument and it is supposed that it was used as the giant’s weapon of war. Inthe coffin were a few pieces of what appeared to be cooking utensils and a hugehollowed stone that probably contained food for the dead. It held also a large,heavy spear flint point and a shield made of skins. After removing the mummy andcoffin, Winter continued the search and a few inches deeper discovered ahandsomely carved pipe, an axe-head of curious shape and several broken piecesof crockery. Many of Winter’s neighbors are digging up the ground around thespot where the body of the dead man was found, in search of additionalcuriosities.” Giant’s AxeWest Virginia Historical Magazine Quarterly, March 17, 1902Charleston, West Virginia This account describes the unearthing of a 7 ft 8 inch skeleton from the GreatSmith Mound in West Virginia by Professor P. W. Norris of the SmithsonianInstitution (see also on page 246). A 1902 letter in the West VirginiaHistorical Magazine Quarterly not only speaks of the find, but also theunearthing several years later of a giant axe that Mr. Roller connects to thegiant discovered years earlier. This letter describes the giant skeleton find,as well as the huge axe.Jim recently received an email from a woman called Sarah from West Virginia, whoemphasised that the people in this letter really existed and were respectedmembers of the community:“Just a side note, both men in the letter you provided me were and still arevery prominent and respected figures in Charleston.”giants-axw-w.virginia-1902.jpg [../Images/image00488.jpeg] Largest Axe in the WorldThe Archaeological Bulletin March/April, 1916 pg. 104Collection of J. G. Braeklein. Des Moines River, Clarke County, Mo. An incredible hand-axe weighing in at a staggering 33 lb and 10 ounces (15.5 kg)was discovered with numerous other artifacts. The axe certainly looks like ithas been wielded and worn down over time, so whoever did this was clearly notsomeone of standard height and size.The axe was discovered by a farmer boy near the mouth of the Des Moines River,Clarke County, Mo., with numerous other artifacts (see overleaf).33lb-axe-head.jpg [../Images/image00489.jpeg] Weapons and Tools Ceremonial Blades of Obsidian and QuartzSeip Mound and Hopewell Group, Ross County, Ohio, 1902 These huge blades were discovered in the Seip Mound and in the Hopewell Groupmounds in Ross County, Ohio. The obsidian blade could also be a giant arrow head(discovered in the Hopewell Group) by Moorehead in 1891. It’s length is 17inches. The smaller 13 inch quartz spearhead was found at Seip Mound. Both weresaid to be “ceremonial or sacrificial offerings.”13seip-mound-obsidian-quartz.jpg [../Images/image00490.jpeg] Our Own Archeology: A Valuable Relic of a Former Age Found in Nebraska, and Whatit TellsBoston Evening Transcript, June 12, 1906 pg. 2(Originally from The Omaha World-Herald)Florence, Nebraska The article mostly discusses the finding of a stone spearhead considered themost symmetrical and sophisticated ever found in Nebraska. Professor Charles F.Crowley of Creighton Medical College determined it was made of flint not foundin that part of the country. The spearhead is described as follows: “The implement, which is seven and one-quarter inches long...and three incheswide...is considered to be the most symmetrical and the best made ever found inthis state...One side of the stone is colored a lustrous cobalt blue, while thereverse is white. Held to the light it is of a beautiful translucent roseorange.” The article continues: “An Omaha Archaeologist who has examined the implement declares it to be anarrowhead, and infers that it was probably used by one of the race of giants ofwhich the legends of the Omaha tribe of Indians speak. One of the tribal secretsocieties which has existed far back in the history of the nation tells of apeople who preceded them in this section of the world, the males of which wereten or twelve feet high. Some ancient mounds opened in this vicinity have shownskeletons between eight to ten feet long.” Ancient Gun FoundNewport Miner, March 17, 1910, pg.2Lincoln County, Idaho A rather interesting account is given that describes an ancient gun being found.Alternatively it could have been acquired from an early Spanish or Europeansettler and the skeleton was not that old, or it is simply a story to sellnewspapers. Who knows? Here it is anyway: “...hidden in the deep recesses of a deep cave 25 miles north of Shoshone,Lincoln County in Southern Idaho, is the skeleton of a giant ten feettall...discovered by a hunting party from this city. As corroborative proof themembers are now exhibiting the rusty and time-worn barrel of what appears to bean ancient gun weighing between 25 and 30 pounds, resembling a flint lock rifle.This they say was picked up beside the skeleton. These bones will be taken outof the cave at the earliest possible date and carefully packed and forwarded tothe Smithsonian Institute.”Just like Native American tribes across the country, the Shoshone have an oralhistory that speaks of giants. The Bruneau River in Idaho was named after aFrench fur-trader in the mid-17th Century. Near its headwaters is the legendaryland of the giants who terrorized the Shoshone forefathers, frightening themfrom their ancestral hunting grounds. Present-day natives still refer to centralIdaho’s Sawtooth Mountains as the Coapiccan Kahni or Giants House. Unique Chert HoesHistory of Franklin County, IndianaJacob Reifel, August 1915, pg.548 This account is interesting because these hoes were found with a very tallskeleton: “Unique Chert Hoes found in Moraine, Twelve feet below the surface, surroundingSkeleton of Prehistoric Giant, Height seven feet six inches.

Dickerson,by Theophilus L. Dickerson, 1915, pg.153Kennard, Indiana This account stands out because it is a rare case of carved ivory, most likelyfrom a prehistoric mastodon tusk. On page 153 of this fascinating book a veryintriguing account from Indiana is found:gravel-mound-indiana-srtisans-book-1.jpg [../Images/image00492.jpeg] When farmers and road builders were digging into the mound for glacialscreenings they found the following: “After opening this deposit to a depth of 12 feet from the top of the mound theyunearthed a human skeleton whose framework measured nearly eight feet in height.His skull would fit over the head of a large man: his jaws being massive andteeth in a perfect state of preservation. On the breast of this big chief was asaucer-shaped vessel of ivory, about six inches in diameter, containing 84 ivorybeads, that must have been made from the tusks of a mastodon.” We finish this chapter with some beautiful stone pipes found in various mounds,illustrated by Squier and Davis. Many of these were found in the mouths of theburied giant skeletons and were clearly an important part of their lifestyle.squier-davis-pipes.bmp [../Images/image00493.jpeg]squier-davis-pipes.bmp [../Images/image00494.jpeg]squier-davis-pipes.bmp [../Images/image00495.jpeg]squier-davis-pipes.bmp [../Images/image00496.jpeg] "},{"pageContent":"10. Mystics & Secret Societies One very interesting twist that occurred during the compiling of historicreports of giant skeletons, was finding that many esoteric sources spoke of thereality of giants and their connection to the lost continent of Atlantis. As wecompiled accounts we started to find that in the literature of the Freemasons,Rosicrucians and Theosophists were giant skeleton accounts listed, some thatwere given as proof of the existence of Atlantis, said to be the original homeof the esoteric mystery teachings that have been passed down through the agesand kept on record by these secret orders.Further research led to discovering that two of the most gifted clairvoyants inhuman history both spoke of the reality of giants and their connection to thislegendary lost landmass. This is a very strange twist in an already intriguingmystery. The reality that a submerged continent did exist in the Atlantic—or oneof the other many theorized locations—is beyond the premise of this book, sotake a look at these accounts for yourself, and enjoy a rare glimpse into asecret world, a mystical realm where giants were said to have existed. Skulls of Giant CavemenThe New Age Magazine, Volume 18, pg. 207, 1913 This account from an Ozark cave in Arkansas is found in The New Age Magazine,given by the highly regarded reporter Victor Schoffelmeyer. The New Age Magazinewas a Rosicrucian publication. Just like indigenous oral history, secrettraditions of the Freemasons and Rosicrucians have been passed down through thegenerations in a thoughtful and meticulous way. Why would these fraternal orderswhose rituals and symbolism are extremely precise, have their doctrines pollutedwith erroneous information? The reality is that both orders cite giant skeletonreports in their literature and use them as proof of a connection they had witha global maritime civilization that existed over 10,000 years ago—a lostcivilization that is thought to be the mother culture where all the esotericknowledge and symbolism they practice came frombook-giants-jim-bill-draft.jpg [../Images/image00497.jpeg].In Search for the Lost Giants, Jim and his brother Bill investigated thisaccount. The site of the cave mentioned had been flooded with the damming andcreation of Beaver Lake. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed Beaver Damduring the years 1960-1966. Bill and professional scuba diver Mike Young divedinto the lake an­d found a huge shelter cave believed to be the site of theskeletal finds. While a 70 ft stone wall was found at the entrance of the cave,showing likely human habitation, but no more clues were forthcoming (see image).Ozark-dive-wall.bmp [../Images/image00498.jpeg] No more documentation describing the skeletal material or what happened to itcould be found either. Further text from the original article reads as follows: “While the historical features of the Ozarks held our attention, by far the mostfascinating discovery was one made by an aged recluse and naturalist who for tenyears had lived in a shelter cave near where we camped. “Dad” Riggins spent muchof his time digging in the ashes which form the floor of many of these caves. Ata depth of more than three feet he found the remains of several giant humanskeletons, including an almost perfect skull which differed in many particularsfrom a modern specimen. When partly joined the largest skeleton was almost tenfeet tall. “Dad” Riggins showed us hieroglyphics covering the Palisades thoughtto be thousands of years old.” Victor Humbert Schoffelmayer (1878-1962) was a newspaper writer and agriculturalauthority educated at New Engelberg College, a Benedictine boarding school innorthwest Missouri, and at Josephinium Technical College in Ohio. LaterSchoffelmayer worked for Menger as a writer on the Southern Messenger. Beginningin 1905 Schoffelmayer was a reporter on a number of newspapers in Missouri,Kansas, Iowa, and Minnesota. He was the art and music critic on the MinneapolisJournal before he became editor in 1913 of the Southwest Trail. Working out ofChicago, he edited the publication at a time when there were few agriculturalbulletins available. He and his wife, Carrie, traveled over 50,000 miles a yearin a special railroad car, promoting farm machinery and distributingagricultural literature.In December 1917 Schoffelmayer began working for George Bannerman Dealy as fieldeditor of the Semi-Weekly Farm News, a subsidiary of the Dallas Morning News;soon thereafter he became their agricultural editor. During the 1920s and 1930she authored four important books. One of these was Texas at the Crossroads(1935).Schoffelmayer served as president of the Texas Chemurgic Council and as a memberof the board of trustees for the Texas A&M Foundation and board of governors ofthe National Farm Chemurgic Council. He was a fellow of the American GeographicSociety, a life member of the Philosophical Society of Texas, and a member ofthe Texas Academy of Science and Sigma Delta Chi, an honorary journalismfraternity. Mr. Schoffelmayer was quite the accomplished individual. In 1939 hewas elected ‘Man of the Year’—a man who also wrote about humans who were tenfeet in height. Rosicrucian Science ConfirmedMercury; A Rosicrucian Messenger of Constructive Philosophy, 1932, pg.205Elrama, Pennsylvania This next account is from the publication - Rosicrucian Science Confirmed - thatdiscusses a skeleton “nearly eight feet tall” unearthed near Elrama,Pennsylvania. The account mentions that the Smithsonian Institution was reportedto have received the remains. Bear in mind, this is the same discovery alreadyfeatured in The Smithsonian Files chapter (p.231).rosicrucian-.jpg [../Images/image00499.jpeg] The same account was reported in The New York Times and other sources. A 7 ft 5in skeleton was the largest uncovered and the skeletons were reported by GeorgeS. Fisher Pennsylvania State Archaeologist to have massive teeth and jawbones.Several months later it was reported that University of Cambridge trainedarchaeologist Donald A. Cadzow accompanied the moving of the remains includingthe giant skeleton to Harrisburg where the Smithsonian took possession of them. Rays from the Stone CrossRosicrucian Fellowship, Volume 7-8 pg. 110, 1917 The following account was listed in the Rosicrucian publication, Rays from therose cross - a magazine of mystical light. The same reference also appeared inthe mystic Madame Blavatsky’s book Isis Unveiled. Blavatsky is the founder ofthe Theosophist movement and once again giants and Atlantis are prominent themesin their belief system.Hpb%5b1%5d.jpg [../Images/image00500.jpeg] Judge E. P. West who reported the startling find mentioned in the account wasalso noted in Smithsonian literature for his excavation reports from Missouri,but oddly this remarkable account did not make it into their official records. “Judge E. P. West discovered a skeleton about 2 weeks ago and made a report toother members of the society. They accompanied him to the mound and took out theremains of 2 skeletons. The bones are very large—so large, in fact when comparedwith an ordinary skeleton on modern date, they appear to have formed part of agiant. The head bones, are monstrous in size. The lower jaw of one skeleton isin a state of preservation, and is double the size of the jaw of a civilizedperson. The thigh-bone when compared with that of an ordinary modern skeleton,looks like that of a horse.” Bone Cave, Tennessee The two following accounts are from the Bone Cave in Tennessee. Jim and Billwere able to investigate this personally during the filming of Search for theLost Giants. They went hundreds of feet into the cave and verified the followingaccount. They spotted torch marks that must have been from when it wasoriginally investigated, and found the dates 1872 and 1899 carved deep in thecave along with some of the names of the explorers. They eventually made it intoa passage filled with water and found a cavernous room at the end but couldcontinue no further because of the high level of danger presented by rock falls,hypothermia and toxic air. The infamous ‘dead house’ was not quite reached. Thisflooded tunnel, however, was possibly connected to the Old Stone Fort, builtroughly 2,000 years ago. Image: Side view of the “Bone Cave showing the entranceon the left, the first “vaulted space” and the proposed location of the “deadhouse” on the top right.ep4-bonecave-graphic.bmp [../Images/image00501.jpeg]Old%20stone%20fort-Tennessee-giant%20skeleltons-solar%20alignment.png[../Images/image00502.jpeg] Mackey’s National Freemason, Oct. 1872 to Sept. 1873, pg. 219 “A few days since some boys discovered an almost entire human skeleton ofmammoth size. The bones of the forearm were nearly 20 inches long, while thebone of the lower part of the leg was longer than an ordinary man’s lower limbs,foot and all. The jaw bone of this giant would slip over the face of an ordinaryman.” The passage used by the Freemasons was originally reported in this newspaperaccount from earlier that year (in March 1872). It describes the investigationthat subsequently took place that Jim and Bill used to navigate their waythrough the caves on their recent expedition. (Note: the repeated text has beenremoved but the rest of it is so fascinating we share it with you in full): The Hartford Weekly Times, March 30, 1872, page 2. “Near this city is a cave commonly known as “Bone Cave,” from which have beenbrought, at various times, by boys and other persons who have tried to exploreits hidden recesses, human bones of unusual size. The popular legends of thepeople are to the effect that it is somewhat connected with the people or racewhich created the “Old Stone Fort,” which stands a short distance to the west ofthe town... Stimulated by these discoveries and a laudable desire to learn thesecrets of this mysterious cavern, on last Thursday six gentlemen, including theeditors of this paper, made this necessary preparations and started out toexplore the “bone cave”.After an exhilarating walk of two miles through a clear bracing air, we reachedthe entrance of the cave, where divesting ourselves of our overcoats andlighting our torches, we entered one of the many passages, but after a shortscramble we found further advance stopped by large pieces of rock that hadfallen and blocked up the passage... Soon other members of the party came downand explorations commenced. We found ourselves in a vaulted chamber abouttwenty-five feet wide by sixty long. with passages leading in every direction.Following one, we rambled on for forty or fifty feet and then there appeared oneof the most beautiful lakes we have ever seen. The water was clear and sweet andthe ceiling over the water, studded with stalactites, reflected back the lightfrom our torches like gems. We had no means of ascertaining the size of thelake, for the banks were perpendicular and it seemed like a pearl set in a bedof rocks. Another passage which was explored by B. F. Fleming was found toextend in a direct line toward the “Old Stone Fort.”This passage followed for a distance of nearly two hundred feet, when furtherprogress was stopped by the passage being filled up with debris. This passagelooks as if it had been cut from the solid rock by the hand of man and givesrise to the hypothesis that at some time, far back in the dark ages, this cavewas used by a race of men—giants if you like—that built this stone fort and themounds and that this underground passage led from the fort to the cave, a miledistant. After a good look at this part of the cave, we returned to daylight,having been underground three hours and traversing over a mile inside the cave.After partaking of a lunch sent us by a very hospitable lady whose name we havemislaid—but not her kindness—we had a short search in the tunnel known as the“Dead House.”Here we found many bones but all in a state of decomposition anddecay. This tunnel or chamber is coated with a soft, loose soil to a depth of afoot or more, into which one can plunge a stick with perfect ease, while all therest of the cave is solid rock.” Image: Left: Jim and Bill at the entrance to “Bone Cave”.

A biographer gave him the nickname“The Sleeping Prophet.” A nonprofit organization, the Association for Researchand Enlightenment was founded in Virginia Beach to facilitate the study ofCayce’s work. A hospital and a university were also established.Cayce_1910.bmp [../Images/image00504.jpeg] Among his 14,000 readings and 25 million words transmitted in a trance state,the clairvoyant Edgar Cayce gave 68 readings on the ancient American moundculture. These are discussed in Greg Little’s excellent book Mound Builders:Edgar Cayce’s Forgotten Record of Ancient America. The Cayce information oftenmatches up with the research we have been carrying out for years. There areseveral mentions of giants in Cayce’s readings. The following is a reading abouta past life of a woman in Florida who was said to have been alive in the era ofthe Mound Builders. The Cayce language is a little strange but does makes sense: “We find the entity was in the land of its present nativity, in what is nowknown as the southernmost portion - or in Florida; during those periods whenthere were those settlings from the Yucatan, from the lands of the Inca, fromthe Norse land, when there were the beginners of the Mound Builders and thosethat gathered upon what is now the east portion of Alabama and Florida - thoughit was quite different then in its structure, outwardly. The entity’s sojournsthen were with those of a race of unusual height, unusual proportions to whatmight be termed in the present.” 1 Edgar Cayce proclaimed in a trance state, among other things, that the Nileflowed backwards in the distant past, a fact verified by recent satelliteimagery and that the Essenes had women in their ranks (announced before gravesof women were discovered at Qumran). Cayce also gave several readings whichmentioned giants. The following is from the Cayce Reading No. 364-11: “Pleasegive a few details regarding the physiognomy, habits, customs and costumes ofthe people of Atlantis during the period just before the first destruction.” Hereplied: “These took on many sizes as to stature, from that as may be called the midgetto the Giants - for there were Giants in the earth in those days, men as tall as(what would be termed today) ten or twelve feet in stature, and wellproportioned throughout.”2 It is telling that Cayce says that they are “well proportioned throughout.” Thisphrase has been noted countless times in newspaper reports and town historiesacross America describing giant skeleton finds. Rudolf Steiner Mystic Rudolph Steiner also made mention of giants existing in Atlantis. “Just at the time when Atlantis began to sink there was a great contrast betweenmen who were good as to their qualities of soul, and were a race of little men,and the giant forms who were wicked and in whom everything turned to flesh.”Rudolf_Steiner_um_1891.jpg [../Images/image00505.jpeg] It is noteworthy that both Steiner and Cayce, just like H.P. Blavatsky, spoke ofthe existence of “little people” in Atlantis. In digging through historicaldocuments searching for giant skeleton accounts we ran into countless reports ofthe skeletons of little people being exhumed from burial mound sites. Manyaccounts mention giant skeletons and little people reported to have been buriedtogether as well. Native Americans, like indigenous peoples all around theglobe, not only have oral traditions describing a race of giants in the past,but of a race of little people that is as intriguing as the countless giantreports! "},{"pageContent":"11. Curse of the Giant Hunters It is widely believed by cultures worldwide that when an ancient burial place isdisturbed, destructive energies can often be unleashed. While this assertion mayseem fanciful to some, we give you several strange accounts from the twilightzone files to suggest that there may some truth to this reality. Nan Madol, Micronesia We start with Nan Madol and its mysterious megalithic ruins located on the tinyMicronesian Island of Pohnpei in the Pacific Ocean.Nan_madol-wikimedia.bmp [../Images/image00506.jpeg]Millions of tons of basalt blocks were transported here to build the site.According to Pohnpeian legend, Nan Madol was constructed by twin giant sorcerersOlisihpa and Olosohpa from the mythical Western Katau, or Kanamwayso. They weresaid to have built the site using levitation and hailed from an ancient advancedcivilization that once existed in the Pacific, often called Lemuria or Mu. Thereare several historical accounts of giant skeletons being found in the area tosupport these legends. The Bulletin of the AmericanGeographical SocietyVolume 1, 1859, pg. 133 “A narrow entrance has, however, been opened at the top, through which wedescended, and found ourselves in a dark cell 8 feet deep, and 11 by 10 feet inlength and breadth. The only light that reached us entered through the cracksbetween the long prisms laid across overhead. The foreigners told us that coralstones once formed a pavement on the floor of the vault, but within 10 or 15years they have been torn up by visitors searching for relics. They say that in1838, Capt. Chas. Coffin, of the ship Ohio, Nantucket, and Capt. E. B. Sherman,of the Marcus, Fairhaven, visited the vaults together, and took from it severalhuman bones of gigantic size.” In episode 4 of Search for the Lost Giants, we explore the “giants curse” Jim’slandlord, Al Pieropan, got in touch with us because he taught on Pohnpeifor several years and heard many strange stories from the islanders. The Nativeson the island viewed the burial place of the ancient giants with superstitiousdread and would not visit the site. Al was even told by native friends not toeat any of the fruit he had taken from the site because it was cursed. The following story has been also widely reported regarding mysterious NanMadol.In the early twentieth century, when the island was under German rule, GovernorVictor Berg entered the sealed tomb of Nan Madol and opened the coffin of theisland’s prehistoric rulers. He reported finding skeletons of giants between twoand three meters tall (7 to 9 feet tall). The next morning, on April 30, 1907,after a stormy night, Governor Berg died. The German physician serving on theisland could not determine the cause of death. The natives were certain it was acurse that proves supernatural powers guarded the city of the dead.Victor Berg did indeed die mysteriously at the age of 46. Rufino Mauricio, theonly archaeologist on Pohnpei has dedicated his life to preserving the ruins:“We don’t know how they brought the columns here and we don’t know how theylifted them up to build the walls, most Pohnpeians believe magic was used to flythem.”1It goes on to tell that locals avoid the ruins believing it to be a place ofsupernatural dread. It has earned the awe of many archaeologists because thebasalt walls were once up to 40 feet high and about 17 feet thick, made up ofseveral million tons of basalt stone columns.2David Hatcher Childress also reports that in the 1930s Japanese archaeologistsunearthed bones of seven-foot men and found platinum coffins that were broughtback to Japan and later destroyed in the Hiroshima nuclear blast!3 Chehalis is Excited: Reported Discovery of an Immense Cave in Lewis CountySpokane Daily Chronicle, March 7, 1901Tacoma, Washington In 1901 a miner called H. F. Forrest reported finding a network of strange caveson the south side of Mount Rainer in Washington after removing a rock that hebelieved “had been hewn by human hands.”4 Forrest reported finding wallsdecorated with hieroglyphs and two stone tombs containing the remains of a 7 ft10 inch man and a 7 ft woman. He claimed they were ornamented with engraved goldjewelry.1901.03.07%20-%20Chehalis%20Is%20Excited%5b1%5d.bmp [../Images/image00507.jpeg] Forrest returned to Chehalis to share his story and attempted to interest othersin joining him to further explore the caves. Forrest however, disappeared andwas never heard from again. His belongings were later found in a hotel room thathe was staying in. 80 Stocktonians Left Behind inSearch for ‘Lost Continent’Stockton Record, June 18, 1934Cascade Mountains, California In 1934 mining engineer J. C. Brown who had worked for the Lord Coudray BritishMining Company, reported an amazing find while working in the northernCalifornia section of the Cascade mountain chain. Brown described finding roomscut out of the mountain of solid rock. He told of stone rooms with copper andgold plates on the walls with many having ‘hieroglyphs’ on them. Brown alsoclaimed to have found one stone room that contained skeletons of immense sizefrom 6 ½ to over 10 feet tall.Brown went to Stockton, California and told his incredible story and convinced alocal newspaper editor and museum curator that he was credible. An expeditionwas organized to explore the caves. As noted in the Stockton Record, 80 peoplewere organized for the expedition. Before the trip started however, Brown wentmissing, never to be heard from again. The residents were baffled with hisdisappearance and held an all-night vigil for him. It was noted that not onlydid Brown seem truthful and responsible but he had profited in no way from hisclaims.legendjcbrown10%5b1%5d.jpg [../Images/image00508.jpeg] Traces of Giants Found in DesertThe Meriden Record, August 5, 1947, pg.2Death Valley, California Fast forward to 1947 and we learn of a reported discovery by retiredphysician Dr. F. Bruce Russell. Russell had claimed to have found 32 caves inthe 180 square mile area of California’s Death Valley and southern Nevada with acolleague, Dr. Daniel S. Bovee, who he had worked with on archaeologicalexcavations in New Mexico several years earlier.In early August of 1947, Howard E. Hill of Los Angeles, spoke before the city’sTransportation Club and told a sensational story that described the originaldiscovery of the first cave by Russell in 1931, when he fell in a mine shaft.His incredible story begins with the discovery of ancient mummies.“...several well preserved mummies were taken Sunday from the caverns in an arearoughly 180 miles square extending through much of Southern Nevada from DeathValley, California, across the Colorado River into Arizona.” Claims were made that bizarre artifacts of all kinds of an advanced and lostcivilization had been discovered in these caves. Strange hieroglyphs werereportedly chiseled on polished granite, and odd symbols were noted.Dr.F.Bruce.Russell-photo.bmp [../Images/image00509.jpeg] “With Dr. Daniel S. Bovee of Los Angeles—who with his father helped open up NewMexico’s cliff dwellings—Dr. Russell has found mummified remains together withimplements of the civilization. Hill said in another cavern was found the ritualhall of the ancient people, together with devices and markings similar to thosenow used by the Masonic Order...He said the explorers believe that what theyfound was the burial place of the tribe’s hierarchy.”He also reported several caverns that contained the mummified remains of 8 and 9ft tall people.After the Second World War, Russell and several amateur archaeologistsincorporated Amazing Explorations Inc. with Howard E. Hill as their spokesman.The goal was to explore the site to prove his story once and for all. However,not long after this, Russell’s car was found abandoned in Death Valley with aburst radiator and he was never heard from again.5 Without Russell to guidethem, later explorers were never able to find the entrance to the cave.However, 15 years earlier a near identical report was published by Bourke Lee inhis book Death Valley Men (1932).6 In the chapter Old Gold, it describes aconversation he had several years earlier with a small group of Death Valleyresidents concerning some incredible caves they had discovered. The storyclosely matched Russell’s discovery in 1931, so it could have been describingthe very same discovery.The explorers who were called “Jack and Bill” told author Bourke Lee that thearea was once underwater and claimed to have seen the remains of ancient docks.They could allegedly see the Furnace Creek Ranch far below them. They toldBourke Lee that they had brought some of the treasure out of the caverns andtried to set up a deal with certain people, including scientists associated withthe Smithsonian Institution, in order to gain help to explore and publicize thecity as one of the wonders of the world.These efforts ended in disappointment because apparently a ‘friend’ of theirsstole the treasure (which was also the evidence) and they were scoffed at andrejected by the scientists when they went to show them the ‘mine’ entrance andcould not find it. Lee never heard from them again.Philip Rife also tells us in his book The Goliath Conspiracy that some possiblecorroboration of the men’s findings comes from a Native American legend aboutDeath Valley: “When the world was young and the valley which is now dry, parched desert was alush hidden harbor of blue water which stretched half way up those mountains tothe Gulf of California, it is said that the Havmusvus came here in huge rowingships. They found great caverns in the Panamaints and in them they built one oftheir cities. Living in their hidden city, the Havmusvus ruled the sea withtheir fast moving ships, trading with far away peoples and bringing strangegoods to the great quays said still to exist in the caverns. Then, as untoldcenturies rolled past, the climate began to change. The water in the lake wentdown until there was no longer a way to the sea. But as time went by the watercontinued to shrink, until the day came when only a dry crust was all thatremained of the great blue lake.” 7Now to turn the freak show factor up to 11, we bring into the story of massmurderer Charles Manson. Manson was arrested at the Barker Ranch near theDevil’s Hole in the Wingate Pass area in 1969, the same location where reportsof the lost cities came from. The Devil’s Hole is a geothermal aquifer-fed poolwithin a limestone cavern. Manson believed the Devil’s Hole site was a gatewayto an underground ancient city that he would take his followers to in order toride out the coming race war. He supposedly sat by the hole meditating for threedays trying to figure out its mysteries.800px-Devils_Hole_4.bmp [../Images/image00510.jpeg] And quite mysterious it is, two divers died there in 1967—their bodies neverrecovered. The hole is filled with caves that apparently connect to othersources of water in the valley, and it may be possible to travel from one to theother, though it would be a foolish journey. So foolish, in fact, that the holeis now fenced off completely.All these accounts speak of artifacts of a vanished race and giant humanremains. Is there really evidence of a lost civilization to be found hidden instrange man-made caves in the western part of this country? Whether thesestories are true or false, it is all intriguing and worthy of furtherinvestigation. Now it is time to step out of the twilight zone and explore theLost City of Giants of Sonora, Mexico. "},{"pageContent":"12. Giants of Sonora, Mexico The saga of the Lost city of Giants in Sonora, Mexico is one of the mostintriguing that we have encountered to date. The story starts out with theinvestigations of Dr. Byron Cummings, the ‘Dean of Southwest Archaeology’. Dr.Cummings was the highly respected head of the Archaeology Department at theUniversity of Arizona. Image: Dr. Byron Cummings was Professor of Archaeology atthe University of Arizona (1915 - 1937) and Director of the Arizona StateMuseum. Photo courtesy of Tad Nichols.Bryon%20Cummings.jpg [../Images/image00511.jpeg] In 1930 Dr. Cummings was contacted by J. L. Coker, a miner who was working inthe isolated Sonora section in Mexico. Coker reported unearthing skeletonsaveraging 8 ft tall with one of the bodies measuring 8 ft 3 inches in height.Coker also described one of the skulls he found as measuring more than a footlong and ten inches wide. These finds match the oral history of the YaquiIndians who claim that a race of giants inhabited the area long ago.sonora_map_lg.bmp [../Images/image00512.jpeg]Old map of the Sonora region that stretches from Mexico into the US. Dr. Cummings explained his findings in the Border Cities Star, Dec, 4, 1930article. The headline read Superstitious Natives Destroy Relics of PrehistoricSupermen:The%20Border%20Cities%20Star%20-%20Dec%204%2c%201930%20pg%201.JPG[../Images/image00513.jpeg]“There have been past discoveries of single skeletons measuring more than theaverage height of present humans, but there never has been several foundtogether so that the existence of a tribe or race of giants could be proven.” Also reported is Dr. Cummings asking the Science Service in Washington to aidthe university in sponsoring the proposed expedition to Sonora, which he endedup leading. This was partly done to verify Coker’s claims.From the Telegraph Herald and Times Journal, Dec. 14, 1930 pg.1, is found anaccount of Dr. Cummings following up the discoveries of Coker several weekslater:The%20Telegraph-Herald%20and%20Times-Journal%20-%20Dec%2014%2c%201930%20pg%201-headline.jpg[../Images/image00514.jpeg] “Sayopa, Sonora, Mexico. Five large skeletons, the first evidences that a raceof supermen once roamed this vast wasteland, were unearthed today by aninternational expedition of scientists. Working rapidly for two nights and aday, the little band of American and Mexican archaeologists unearthed thepetrified remains of a youth 6 feet 8 inches tall, the skeletons of four otherchildren of lesser stature and several jars filled with human ashes. Theimportance of these discoveries was the fact that they definitely establishedthe scene of operations as a great burial ground, according to Dr. ByronCummings, dean of the University of Arizona archaeology department and leader ofthe expedition.” It is reported that Dr. Cummings and Professor Manuel San Domingo, a MexicanGovernment scientist of Sonora, faced the fierce and superstitious Yaqui Indiansat the burial place of the giants in Sonora. Despite the pleas of thescientists, the Yaquis smashed to pieces the giants’ bones with their riflebutts: “However, before the expedition could get properly to work, down swooped theYaquis armed with rifles and knives. They fiercely bade the archaeologists quitor take the consequences. The Mexican professor tried in vain to placate theIndians. His remonstrances were abruptly shattered by a tough Yaqui brave whoupraised a heavy rifle butt and battered the giant remains to pieces.” This story certainly does not end there and gets stranger in the years to come.The American Southwest had always been a hotspot of giant skeleton reports, manytimes the accounts tell of strange caves and artifacts associated with a lostancient race that possessed a high degree of technology. From the PrescottEvening Courier Dec. 11, 1930 pg.5, is a letter to the editor by a WilliamCrocker. Crocker says the following about the expeditions to Sonora, Mexico: “Nearly every issue of the papers during the last week has had something to sayabout an expedition going into Mexico to search for the bones of a race ofgiants. Why go to Mexico? Several years ago, Bill Singleton, a boss on thehighway, told me while working on the road through Chino Valley some human boneswere dug up which, when compared with those of the average man today, indicatedthey belonged to a race of men who measured between nine and ten feet tall. JessKiple at Pruchman’s will verify this statement. Another interesting find in thissection was one made several years ago between Dewey and Humboldt a new piece ofroad cut into an old burial ground. Del Daves, now dead, doing some diggingthere, found two skeletons lying side by side, each about 4 feet long and eachhaving enormous heads. Beth Gray, a mining man of this section who saw theskulls, said they were so big that it would take a number nine hat to fit them.” So, what is going on here? Dwarves with huge heads, alongside giant skeletonsbeing unearthed in Mexico by a team led by the prominent archaeologist Dr. ByronCummings of the University of Arizona. Reports of giants (and little people) arein fact circulating all over the country, often times by respected scientists.The story then continues with the following account reported in theTelegraph-Herald and Times-Journal four years after the initial report of giantsmade by Dr. Byron Cummings. In the Dec 9, 1934 article,Dr. Cummings announces finding the bodies of men and women in Yaqui country whowere are all over seven feet tall in a perfect state of preservation. Dr.Cummings stated that the find was made by ethnologist Paxson C. Hayes of SantaBarbara, California: “Traces of a lost race of giants, who wore oriental turbans and mummified theirdead in a fashion similar to that of the ancient Egyptians have been found inthe Yaqui Indian country in Sonora, Mexico. Other traces of the oriental originof the ancient giants was reported by Hayes who declared he had found severaltables buried near the mummies. These tables were of a size similar to thoseunearthed recently in the heart of the Gobi desert.”Also reported in the San Jose Evening News, May 22, 1933, pg.38 is:“Hayes spent four years excavating 34 mummies from one of the caves. Hayesbrought back evidence of a civilization which may compel archaeologists torevise theories of the origin of the American Indian.”San%20Jose%20Evening%20News%20-%20May%2022%2c%201933%20pg%2038.jpg[../Images/image00515.jpeg] Hayes’ went on describe anatomic anomalies such as elongated heads and reddishhair: “They have slant eyes and sloped foreheads...the hair, which is black, has apeculiar auburn tinge when examined closely.” Paxson Hayes’ interest in the study of snakes is what initially brought him tothe region, then Yaqui Indians told him of the location of the lost city and ofa mysterious giant race. Paxson Hayes lived with the fierce Yaqui Indians ofSonora for seven years and became close to them and was accepted by them, whichturned out to be the key to gaining access to the region.Jim and his brother Bill had an opportunity to meet with Carlos Hayes, the sonof Paxson, at his place south of Tucson, Arizona, to discuss his father’sfindings. Whilst filming Search for the Lost Giants Carlos informed them thatthe Yaquis are fiercely independent people who could never be controlled by theMexican or US governments. His father earned the trust of the Yaquis and theyallowed him to explore the vast caves of Sonora where he found the lost city ofgiants. Carlos theorized that the reason that many of these giant skeleton findswere not scientifically established is because native peoples did not trust theintentions of the interlopers who sought to desecrate sacred and ancient places.Although Hayes was accepted by the Yaqui and allowed to explore the area, Dr.Byron Cummings was not. Therefore, the Yaquis smashed the giant skeletal remainsto pieces after an ancient burial mound had been opened by mining engineers.Then we have from the Milwaukee Journal, Mar 8, 1935, pg.8, the continuing storyof Hayes and his explorations into Sonora. A Mr. Marshall, the author of thearticle from The Detroit News reports the following about this episode:1935-sonora-lost-city-of-giants.jpg [../Images/image00516.jpeg] “While I was in Nogales, Ariz., six weeks ago, Hayes, the discoverer of the lostcity, came out of the hills long enough to re-outfit, and to present competent,factual proof of the nature of his discoveries, before returning to the site ofthe lost city, which is 11 days’ muleback journey southward from Hermosilla,capital of Sonora. Hayes had pictures of the mummified bodies of members of therace of giants. Thirty-four mummies have been uncovered, and the smallestmeasured seven feet one inch in height. He had pictures of the ruins of thebuildings and samples of the burial shrouds, all in a fair state ofpreservation. Confirmation of the prescience of the ruins of an ancientcivilization in Sonora came two years ago. Since then Hayes’ party has madeseven expeditions into Yaqui country.”9614-skull-mummy-hayes-front.bmp [../Images/image00517.jpeg] Image: Paxson Hayes with head of giant mummy. The head is enclosed in a hugegourd. Official Press Photo no. 9614/ACME, 27th December 1935. Nine months later we have the photo above and following description from the SanJose News, December 31, 1935 pg.12: “Paxson Hayes, explorer, studies the head of a giant mummy discovered by him ina deep cave hitherto unexplored regions of Sonora, Mexico. The mummified remainswere of a race 7 ½ feet tall and preserved in excellent condition. Corn foundwith the mummies has been given to scientists.” Then a year later is found from the Spokane Daily Chronicle, January 9, 1936,pg.11: “These crumbling ruins of a long-perished city, where mummified human formsrevealed that seven-foot giants and three foot pygmies apparently livedtogether, were found by Paxson C. Hayes ethnologist, who has spent the lastseven years exploring the upland wastes of northern Mexico. The architecture isof a type never before discovered, resembling that of cliff dwellings but withdistinct Mongolian features. The strange civilization is believed to antedatethat of the Mayans. Hayes plans an expedition for a thorough search of the hugecaves in Sonora, 400 miles from Hermosillo City.” The story continues and we are informed from the Berkeley Daily Gazette, Jun 10,1937, pg.1: “The many reports of a race of “supermen” who once inhabited parts of theMexican State of Sonora received new support today with the arrival of Paxson C.Hayes and C. G. Barnes both of Santa Barbara en route from Sonora to Washington.Bringing out of Sonora a Mexican boa constrictor and stories of mummified andskeletal remains of men and women from six feet and seven inches to eight feettall, they announced they had discovered the district of “the lost city ofSonora”. They planned to continue to Washington, for a conference with theMexican Ambassador, Francisco Najera, to seek cooperation of Mexican scientistsin exploration of the discoveries. Hayes was embroiled in a controversy with Dr.Roy Chapman Andrews of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, in 1933, overthe existence of the so-called “super-men” or race of giants. Reports of theexistence of remains of a race of giants have been recurrent throughout theSouthwest since before 1930. Skeletons actually were found by a party headed byDr. Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona, which indicated the existenceof such a race, it was said. The Cummings expedition was driven out of Sonora bythreats of an uprising of Yaqui Indians.” Regardless of the evidence presented, the Smithsonian did not seem to be overlyinterested in these finds for some odd reason. Dr. Cummings in fact, was verycritical of eastern scientific institutions such as the Smithsonian. Not onlydid Dr. Cummings report finding giant skeletal remains but he was embroiled in acontroversy when he discovered human remains with prehistoric animals whichindicated a much greater antiquity for humans on this continent. Carlos Hayesinformed us that his father lost his funding earlier on in his explorations butcontinued the rest of his life to bring this evidence to light.

Hayes and fellow explorer Gerald C. Barnes continues asthey arrive in Washington D.C. Reported in The Washington Post, July 22, 1937 is“Smithsonian Amazed at Discovery of 6 ½-Foot Mummies in Caves.” We are informedof the following from the article: “With several dozen snakes (all alive), and the burial robe of a prehistoricgiant (quite dead), packed in their trailer, they stopped in Washingtonyesterday to promote interest in their unique fields of activity.Herpetologically speaking, their purpose in coming here from California was topresent President Roosevelt with 15 Smoki snakes., 10 California and Mexicanrattlers and an 8-foot baby Mexican boa constrictor, which was shedding. MarvinC. McIntyre received them at the White House, expressed gratitude and suggestedthe reptile house at the zoo as perhaps the best place for the snakes. Dr.Ernest P. Walker, assistant director of the Zoo, officially welcomed the snakesto their new home. That over, the visitors then dropped in at the SmithsonianInstitution with the prehistoric burial robe and a four-legged stool, both ofwhich they unearthed in a burial cave in northern Sonora, Mexico. TheCalifornians explained that the cave, one of 18 they had discovered, containswell preserved mummies of a race which averaged over 6 ½ feet in height(previously reported up to 8 feet tall). The caves are scattered over an area of450 square miles. Hayes who has just returned from his fifth expedition to thecaves heard about their existence from the Yaqui Indians of Mexico.” The article also shows a photo of Hayes, Barnes, and W. H. Blackburn, HeadKeeper of the Washington Zoo, as they assist a Mexican boa constrictor. Jimfound the following information in the Annual Report of the Board of Regents ofthe Smithsonian Institution 1937 (pg 74), citing additions to their collections.“Smoki People, through Paxson C. Hayes and G. C. Barnes, Prescott, Ariz., 5Western bullsnakes, 2 red rattlesnakes, 2 Mexican rattlesnakes.”In 1933, Hayes was already in a dispute with Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews, aSmithsonian scientist, over reported giant skeletal finds. A logical guess isthat they did not follow up on these finds either.This final article from The Deseret News, Nov 9, 1950 pg.2, is the last mentionwe could find of this story after literally 20 years of descriptive articlesfilled with twists and turns. The%20Deseret%20News%20-%20Nov%209%2c%201950%20pg%202.jpg[../Images/image00519.jpeg] This report is essentially a summation of the facts of the case, but alsomentioned that some of the giant mummies had blond hair, although this is notmentioned in the earlier reports. Here are some highlights: “When the bones of the mummies were laid out properly the various bodiesmeasured from seven feet six inches in most cases up to the largest skeletonwhich was a full eight feet.”sonora-paxon=robe.jpg [../Images/image00520.jpeg] “The greatest mystery of Hayes’ finds...were the saffron colored burial robesfound on the giants. There may be a great historic tale behind the powder-bluedesigns of latch hooks and pyramids that embellish the robes. Hayes thinks thatthe tiny series of white dots that recur throughout the robes are symbols of theancient Indian time cycle...” It is also mentioned that Hayes took the burial robes to the chiefs of the SeriIndians on Tiburon Island off the West coast of Mexico and they were as puzzledas him.9613-explorer-finds-tombs-front.bmp [../Images/image00521.jpeg] Image above: One of the giant mummies in the entrance of the cave. This mummy is7 ½ feet tall. The cloth and rope is a variety never before seen. Official PressPhoto no. 9613/ACME, 27 Dec 1936. Our guess is that none of the players in this lengthy story had any support fortheir stories or evidence, and probably ended -up frustrated—resigned thatclosed mindedness may have undone the truth. In an effort to explain thereluctance that some professionals have to entertain theories outside ofaccepted paradigms, we quote from Thomas Kuhn’s Structure of ScientificRevolutions: “Mop-up operations are what engage most scientists throughout their careers.This paradigm-based research is an attempt to force nature into the pre-formedand relatively inflexible box that the paradigm supplies. No effort is made tocall forth new sorts of phenomena, no effort to discover anomalies. Whenanomalies pop up they are usually discarded or ignored. Anomalies are usuallynot even noticed and no effort is made to invent a new theory—and there is notolerance for those who try.” The mysteries of Sonora do not end here though. In 2012 the following wasreported: “Excavation of an ancient burial site in South Sonora, Mexico, has revealed aseries of skeletons with intentionally deformed skulls. Of the 25 sets of humanremains found close to the Mexican village of Onavas, 13 had deformed craniums.”1 sonora-elongated-skull.jpg [../Images/image00522.jpeg] Carlos Hayes, the son of Paxson, told us that he would take us into Sonora tosearch for the lost city of giants when the time is right.ep5-carlos-hayes.bmp [../Images/image00523.jpeg]Carlos (pictured above) is friends with the Yaqui Indians of the area, but atthe time of filming there was a dangerous travel warning posted for the region,so that exploration is on hold....for now.hayes-pic-with-corn.bmp [../Images/image00524.jpeg] Image above: Paxson Hayes is pictured with some of the corn he found in caves inSonora.

Simpson reportedfinding a giant petrified human bone buried 52 feet deep in the earth. Simpson’swife, “who is a woman of education and friends of Herbert Spencer and ThomasCarlyle in her youth, took up the work of learning the significance of thefind.” Dr. W. R. Cassels of Fairbanks pronounced the bone to be undoubtedly fromthe leg of a prehistoric giant and others who have seen it agree with him. Thisand any others to be discovered were turned over to the Smithsonian Institutionin the hope that they would conduct a further investigation (see news report andphoto overleaf). .alaska-petrified%20human%20bone.jpg [../Images/image00528.jpeg] CANADACanada-old-map-1677.bmp [../Images/image00529.jpeg] Indian Burying Ground is FoundThe Border Cities Star, Sept. 5, 1934, pg.19Simcoe, Ontario, Canada W. Edgar Cantelon, curator of the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Antiquitiesannounced the discovery that included skeletons measuring eight feet in heightand large deposits of arrowheads, spears, drills, gorgets, wampum and pottery: “Evidence showed thousands of persons lived in the district, he said, some ofwhom were extraordinarily tall. Skeletons measuring about eight feet in heighthave been unearthed.” William Cantelon was an artist as well as curator of the Norfolk museum, whichstill exists. By all accounts Mr. Cantelon was widely respected and beloved. Skeletons of Giants - Lost City DiscoveredWest Coast Times, Issue 1924, November 29, 1871Cayuga, Canada The report discusses a find made earlier that year on August 21st, and we haveincluded the full story as it gives a fascinating insight into the lives ofthese Canadian titans: “On Wednesday last, Rev. Nathaniel Wardel, Messrs Orin Wardell, of Toronto andDaniel Fredenburg, were digging on the farm of the later gentleman, which is onthe banks of the Grand River, in the township of Cayuga. When they got to fiveor six feet below the surface a strange sight met them. Piled in layers, oneupon top of the other, some two hundred skeletons of human beings nearlyperfect—around the neck of each one being a string of beads. There were alsodeposited in this pit a number of axes and skinners made of stone. In the jawsof several of the skeletons were large stone pipes, one of which Mr. O. Wardelltook with him to Toronto a day or two after this Golgotha was unearthed.These skeletons are those of men of gigantic stature, some of them measuringnine feet, very few of them being less than seven feet. Some of the thigh boneswere found to be at least half a foot longer than those at present known and oneof the skulls being examined completely covered the head of an ordinary person.These skeletons are supposed to belong to a race of people anterior to theIndians. The pit and its ghastly occupants are now open to the view of any whomay wish to make a visit there.There is not the slightest doubt that the remains of a lost city are on thisfarm. At various times within the past years the remains of mud-homes with theirchimneys had been found; and there are dozens of pits of a similar kind to thatjust unearthed, though much smaller, in the place which has been discoveredbefore, though the fact has not been made public hitherto. The remains of ablacksmith shop, containing two tons of charcoal and various implements, wereturned up a few months ago. The farm, which consists of 150 acres, has beencultivated for nearly a century and was covered with a thick growth of pine, sothat it must have been ages since the remains were deposited there. The skullsof the skeletons are of enormous size and are of all manner of shapes. The teethof most of them are still in an almost perfect state of preservation, thoughthey soon fall out when exposed to air. Some large shells, supposed to have beenused for holding water, which were also found in the pit, were almost petrified.A good deal of excitement exists in the neighborhood and many visitors call atthe farm daily. The skulls and bones of the giants are fast disappearing, beingtaken away by curiosity hunters. It is the intention of Mr. Fredenburgh to coverthe pit very soon. From the appearance of the skulls it would seem that theirpossessors died a violent death, as many of them were broken and dented. Thebeads are all of stone and of all sizes and shapes. The pipes are not unlike inshape the cutty pipes and several of them are engraved with dog’s heads. Theyhave not lost their virtue of smoking. Some people profess to believe that thelocality Fredenburgh Farm was formerly an Indian burial-place but the enormousstature of the skeletons and the fact that pine trees of centuries growthcovered the spot, go far to disprove the idea.” HAWAIIhawaii-1779.bmp [../Images/image00530.jpeg] Three Skeletons of Olden Giants are DiscoveredThe Honolulu Star Bulletin, December 22, 1913, pg.2Waimea, Hawaii The Hawaiian Islands revealed this astonishing account:hawaii.jpg [../Images/image00531.jpeg] “Three gigantic skeletons, unearthed a few days ago at Waimea, Hawaii havearoused intense interest among those who have heard of the unusual happening.The immense size of the skeletons confirm stories in Hawaiian legends of thegreat stature and tremendous strength of the men of old...John H. Wise, who hasbeen at work in the Waimea homestead district on the homesteading project inwhich he and several other local people are interested, vouches for thecorrectness of the information, having personally inspected the skeletons andmade rough but practical measurements of some of the bones. ‘There is noquestion that the men living were well over seven feet high,’ said Wise today.‘The leg bones for instance, were far longer than that of any man of Hawaiitoday, so far as we know.’I am something over five-feet-ten in height and the leg-bone, from foot to kneecame halfway between my knee and thigh. The bones were of immense size. Theskulls were also of great size...Perhaps unfortunately for scientific research,the Hawaiians who were employed on the road-gang refused to allow the skeletonsto be taken away and they were reburied.However, Wise says they can probably be secured in case they should be desiredfor the Bishop Museum. He thinks the ethnologists would find much interest in astudy of what were evidently physical giants...The bodyguard of the Maui kingaccording to the tradition, was composed of warriors over seven feet and thetradition declares that every one of those giants perished in battle and thepoint where the bodyguard was destroyed, before the king and his followers fled,is said to be about where the skeletons have now been found.” This account lined-up precisely with the oral tradition of indigenous Hawaiians,right down to the location of the burial spot. Prehistoric Men 7 feet TallThe New Castle News, Friday, January 7, 1944, pg 6.Big Island, Hawaii “Beneath layers of lava and coral on the Island of Hawaii have been foundskeletons of prehistoric men seven feet tall.” However, that is all that was reported so no further details are forthcoming. The Button Box: A Daughter’s LovingMemoir of Mrs. George S. Patton,2005, pg.167, Mauna Loa, Hawaii, circa 1910 “The Parker ranch was on the mighty slope of Mauna Loa, the volcanic mountainopposite the Carter’s house. One of the painolas told Ma that when he was alittle child, one of his great-grandfathers had died and the family took himinto the hollow cone for burial. There, by the light of torches, the little boysaw his ancestors, mummified by the airless dark, wrapped in their feather capesand lying in their great canoes. The paniola told Ma, that the bodies were ofvery tall men—giants. Ma was dying to see this but the cowboy told her that noone knew any more where the entrance to the cinder cone was. The people wereafraid that strangers would enter the sacred place and vandalize it. They hadhidden the tunnel.A young Mr and Mrs George S. Patton on their wedding day, 1910.patton-wedding-01.bmp [../Images/image00532.jpeg] Mr. Carter was very interested when Ma told him this story. He said he had knownabout it for forty years but had never known any of his Hawaiians to tell astranger. However, he did know of a burial cave that she could see that shecould see that might interest her and he arranged to have us taken there by apart-Hawaiian friend of his named Mr. White. Mr. White was very interested inthe history of his people and was delighted to find someone else who shared hispassions, so he took us to the Grave of the Common Dead near Hoonaunau. Thiscave was a broken lava tube, halfway up a crumbling lava flow, similar to acliff. We had to get there by climbing a rope ladder. At the front of the cave,in the light, were recent burials—many in coffins and a few wrapped in tapacloth like their ancestors. Some of the coffins were open and we were fascinatedby the skeletons.I could have stayed there all day, but Mr. White wanted us to come inside. Hehad a lantern with him and we saw an extraordinary sight. The lava tube waslarger as you got away from the sunlit entrance and on the floor were seeminglynumberless skeletons laid out nearly side by side. The ones toward the frontwere about normal size, but toward the back of the cave they got bigger andtaller. Mr. White took out a tape measure and, walking carefully around thebones, measured one fairly complete skeleton to show that it was more than sevenfeet tall. He said the ancient Hawaiians had been a race of giants.” The “Ma” referred to by daughter Ruth Ellen Patton Totten was the wife of WorldWar II hero, General George S. Patton. The description given in the book matchesin many respects skeletal finds from other parts of Hawaii such as the deadbeing buried in canoes and lava tubes. The Secrets and Mysteries of Hawaiiby Chiles Pila, 1995, pp. 162-163 “At the north end of the Big Island, near the sleepy town of Hawi, is a large750-pound rock in the middle of the road. It is about the size and weight of aGeneral Motors V-8 diesel engine block. It was carried there by King Kamehamehaall the way up from the floor of Waipio Valley. He used only his brute strength.King Kamehameha the Great was over seven feet tall and considered a god amongmen. King Kamehameha (1758 – May 8, 1819), conquered the Hawaiian Islands andformally established the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. Like many Native Americanrulers he was a giant in stature and possessed herculean strength.” The following is from Hawaiian Folklore Tales by C. Alexander Stames, 1975, pg.79: “Although King Kamehameha was reputed to be 7 feet 10 inches in height, 8 foot 3inch skeletons have been unearthed on various parts of Hawaii.” From The Californian, Volume 4, 1881, page 259 is found the following, “John Li, was a native Hawaiian. Lot Pakee, the oldest, the mightiest and thegrandest of the ancient line of chiefs, was Chamberlain. He was nearly sevenfeet high, of magnificent proportionate frame, had the strength of a Herculesand often in his early manhood had he performed prodigies of valor andsurprising feats of athletic nature.” It appears that a royal class of giants may have been a mainstay of ancientsocieties, sometimes almost up until the present. The Mystery of theCalifornia Channel IslandsChannel-islands-ca.bmp [../Images/image00533.jpeg] The Channel Islands off the coast of California have turned up hundreds ofcontroversial discoveries. Not only were giant skeletons reported, but also aprehistoric stone circle (see Early Explorers chapter) along with ancient carbondating and evidence of red and blond cultures with “ruddy” skin. Numerousoversized skeletons, artifacts, and evidence of occupation going back as far as40,000 years ago have been recorded on the islands.4 The story is intriguing andcontroversial, and it stars amateur archaeologist Ralph Glidden and his bizarremuseum on Catalina Island, but before the main act, a German naturalist got thestory going in 1913. Story of a Skull, Buried Six Centuries,Tells of the Perfect AmericanPittsburg Press, July 20, 1913Catalina Island, California Dr. A. W. Furstenan reported unearthing an 8 ft tall skeleton with artifactssuch as mortar and pestles and arrow heads on Catalina. He was told of a legendwhile in Mexico of a giant and noble race that lived on the Island, who existedlong before the white man and had sincevanished. Here he is pictured with one of the skullsCatalina-1913-early-account.jpg [../Images/image00534.jpeg] Indians are Rising out of LegendOgden Standard Examiner, Sunday, November 10, 1929, pg.32Santa Catalina Island, California Amateur archaeologist Ralph Glidden unearthed and collected a total of 3,781skeletons on the Channel Islands between 1919 and 1930. Working for the HeyeFoundation of New York he claimed to have unearthed a 9 ft 2 in skeleton andseveral measuring over 7 feet: “A skeleton of a young girl, evidently of high rank, within a large funeral urn,was surrounded by those of sixty four children, and in various parts of theisland more than three thousand other skeletons were found, practically all themales averaging around seven feet in height, one being seven feet eight inchesfrom the top of his head to the ankle, and another being 9 feet 2 inches tall.”catalina-glidden.jpg [../Images/image00535.jpeg]The Indian was the largest found on the islandThe L.A. Times, August 21, 1938, pg.3 The article is about the reported unearthing of another over 7 ft skeleton onCatalina Island by Ralph Glidden and Judge Earnest Windle: “Glidden made the discovery, notified the judge, who joined him and wrote of it.‘The Indian was the largest found on the island’ Windle says, ‘Had he been alivetoday he would have worn a hat size 10 ½. He was seven feet two and one-halfinches tall and must have weighed in the neighborhood of 300 pounds. His jawbonewas so huge that the inside of it will fit easily, and leave room to sparearound the outside of a normal person.’” Giant’s Body Found at AvalonThe Indian Valley Record, May 13, 1937, pg. 2 This is a continuation of giant skeletal remains found in the previous report: “Workmen excavating for a pipeline on Avalon’s main street uncovered theskeleton of a giant measuring seven foot and three inches.”Indian%20Valley%20Record%20-%20May%2013%2c%201937%20pg%202.jpg[../Images/image00536.jpeg]Catalina Islander Magazine 1924 - 1937 Three articles from the Catalina Islander magazine from 1924, 1930, 1931 and1937 shed further light on Glidden’s discoveries. Even the famous author andmystic Arthur Conan Doyle—who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories—is quotedspeaking of Catalina Island and the seven feet tall skeletons.This is from the Catalina Islander January 16th 1924: “I have mentioned that an Indian graveyard was found upon the island. I had anopportunity of studying the photographs of the skeletons. One of them was a manseven feet in height, so they were clearly a very different race from those oldsavages whose stocky figures and gorilla-like skulls were being uncovered atthat very moment at Santa Barbara...” In the Catalina Islander April 2, 1930 page 6 is found: “Although the writer of this article visited many of the Catalina Indian townsites and burial places of the interior while Professor Glidden had done hisexcavation work during the past 17 years, a recent visit to the museum was veryinteresting... One of the skulls measured 26 ½ inches, and the body with itindicated that the man was fully seven feet in height.”Catalina%20Indian%20Giant%207%20feet%202%20and%20a%20quarter%20inches%20tall..jpg[../Images/image00537.jpeg] The Catalina Islander November 18th, 1931 page 10: “Before the advent of the white man, a tribe of Indians, recorded by Spanishexplorers as ‘white Indians’ inhabited the island. Their complexions were ruddyand their skins almost as white as their own, according to the chroniclers. Thatthey were a giant race is proved through recent excavations that have been madein ancient burial grounds which have brought to light skeletons of those earlypeople, that measure from seven to nine feet in height.”The report continues and speculates on their origins: “Anthropologists believe that the Catalina Indians may have originated fromcertain Peruvian mountain tribes known to have been of fair complexion. Finds ofsome of the artifacts lend strength also to the theory that they may have beenrelated to the Aztecs or the Mayas.” Also from February 11, 1937, page 4: “Recent excavations made on Santa Catalina Island by Ralph Glidden, curator ofthe Catalina Museum of the Channel Islands substantiated the historic referencesto a race of Indians of gigantic stature that once inhabited this islandparadise. A great funeral urn fashioned out of stone, its rim decorated withfour equi-distant circles of wampum is zealously guarded in a glass case in theGlidden Museum... Glidden found a man, probably a guard, that measured sevenfeet nine inches in height.” The stone urn mentioned here weighs 134 pounds and was buried with the giantskeleton. It was described as “fashioned as skillfully as though by modern toolsinstead of primitive implements.” The urn is still housed at the Catalina IslandMuseum.In 1962, Philip K. Wrigley purchased Glidden’s entire collection and donated itto the Museum. Due to NAGPRA, many of the Museum’s American Indian remains arehoused at the University of California and studied by archaeologists at theFowler Museum.Jim made contact with the assistant curator of the Catalina Island museum JohnBorrangina, who in March 2012 rediscovered Glidden’s lost records, photos andfield notes as reported in The L.A. Times after being stored away in themuseum’s attic for nearly 90 years.5 All the photos have since been cataloguedand numbered and have been analysed by various researchers including L.A.Marzulli who believe some of the examples may be as tall as 8 ft 6 inches,fitting in with previous discoveries on the island.6As part of Search for the Lost Giants, Jim and Bill Vieira visited Catalina toinvestigate the contents of the box, and indeed there were photos of hundreds ofskeletons and skulls, excavations, artifacts, and burials. After carefullylooking through everything at the museum and scanning the island from abird’s-eye view (thanks to a helicopter), they returned home with a bad taste intheir mouths. Clearly Glidden had little respect for the sacred burials of thisincredibly ancient culture and treated the bones and skulls as props in hisbizarre and morbid museum.However, during their investigation of Glidden’s records, the Vieira brothersdid find an account of a 28-inch femur unearthed by Glidden on San NicolasIsland reported by the judge of Avalon, Earnest Windle. This would make thegentleman over 8 feet tall and the next account may point to the veracity ofthis discovery.ep5-catalina-pics.bmp [../Images/image00538.jpeg] San Nicolas Island, CaliforniaThe Evening Tribune, July 7, 1897, pg.3 “After nearly three weeks sojourn on the barren island of San Nicolas a party ofrelic hunters reached Long Beach, Cal. loaded with skeletons, skulls and ancientimplements and ornaments of Indian tribes... There were 11 in the party whichleft Long Beach in the gasoline schooner San Clemente for San Nicolas Island,which lies 65 miles off the coast of Santa Barbara... The party found 87 skullsburied in the sand of the island but were only able to secure three entire...Positive evidence was found that the island was inhabited by two or moredifferent races in the dim past, one of which was of great size, a peculiarcharacteristic being gigantic jawbones. Some of the specimens of the latterbrought by the party are almost large enough to slip over the head of anordinary man... Mr. Longfellow, one of the party, speaking of the trip said, “Iam sure that two different races fought and died on the island, as most of thebodies were of moderate size while some were almost giants. The latter werealways in isolated graves. We found many stone implements and weapons of stonebut all are very crude and show almost no ornamentation.” Santa Rosa IslandThe Native Races of the Pacific States of North America,Hubert Howe Bancroft, pp. 694-695, 1875 - 1882 This account is also featured in The Scientific American1 (also see DRTchapter). A Mr. Taylor heard from a resident of San Buenaventura that: “...in a recent stay on Santa Rosa Island, in 1861, he often met with entireskeletons of Indians in the caves. The signs of their rancherias were veryfrequent, and the remains of metates, mortars, earthen pots, and other utensilsvery common. Extensive caves were met with which seemed to serve as burialplaces of the Indians, as entire skeletons and numerous skulls were plentifullyscattered about in their recesses. Further skulls are also reported as havingbeen found on the islands, furnished with double teeth.” Seven ft tall skeletons were reported (see image below), and some startlingcarbon dating emerged putting these inhabitants back to around 7,000 years old.Santa-Rosa-Cali.gif [../Images/image00539.jpeg] In 1941, Phil Orr of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History began work onthe island. In over thirteen years of work he excavated 180 sites, and in 1959at a place called Arlington Springs, he discovered something that shocked theworld.Orr found a human femur, and believed the remains were those of a 10,000-yearold man and dubbed him the “Arlington Springs Man.” However they were laterbelieved to be female and she was renamed “Arlington Springs Woman.” Afterthirty years of matriarchal glory, she became “Arlington Springs Man’ again! Newtests showed that he dated back to 13,000 years ago, 1,400 years older thanpreviously thought.The March 2011 edition of Science, had this headline that confirmed the deepantiquity of these early inhabitants: “Evidence for a diversified sea-based economy among North American inhabitantsdating from 12,200 to 11,400 years ago is emerging from three sites onCalifornia’s Channel Islands.” 2 Jon Erlandson, professor of anthropology and director of the Museum of Naturaland Cultural History at the University of Oregon said: “The points we are finding are extraordinary, the workmanship amazing. They areultra thin, serrated and have incredible barbs on them. It’s a verysophisticated chipped-stone technology.” 3 This type of technology may indeed be related to some other sites of an evenearlier age that we will explore in the next chapter. We will also investigateif this archaic human activity is related to the giant discoveries on the sameislands. This lays down an intriguing possibility as to the origins of the NorthAmerican giants.ep5-catalina-jim-bill.bmp [../Images/image00540.jpeg] Image: Jim and Bill Vieira going through Ralph Glidden’s records at the CatalinaIsland Museum.4602.png [../Images/image00541.jpeg] "},{"pageContent":"14. Origins of the Tall Ones The debate over the origins of the North American giants has been going on fornearly 200 years. Native American mythology, the latest scientific research,genetic data, and ethnological research is shedding light on these mysteries,and the enigmatic Denisovans, Nephilim, and visitors from other ancient culturesmay have been involved. Extremely old skeletal remains and anomalies such as250,000-year-old Hueyatlaco finds in Mexico, as well as the mummified red-hairedremains in Nevada, do pose a series of tantalising problems that any buddinggiantologist might ponder. North America has ample evidence of outside migrationwell before first contact over 500 years ago, but there is still a huge questionmark over the origins of those mighty giants we have discussed in this book.Natives-heights-W%c3%bcnsch%2c%20Christian%20Ernst%2c%201744-1828.bmp[../Images/image00542.jpeg]In this final chapter, we will look at numerous theories as to where thesegiants came from, how they got so big, and why they are no longer with us. If webreak down the hundreds of theories of who is proclaimed to have visited NorthAmerica before the white man arrived, we are left with just a few examples thatmay be related to the Tall Ones. However, as Ross Hamilton, Vine Deloria Jr.,and archaeologists such as Jeffrey Goodman point out, the origins of the TallOnes might well have been within the confines of America itself, and there isevidence that they had protocols in place to maintain their elite status overmultiple generations. “The very tall native people recorded early in American history were said to beof a time-honored tradition of selective mating or marriage both fragile and ina stage of imminent collapse. The introduction of smallpox hastened things. LikeEuropean royalty, there apparently existed prescribed marital protocols amongcertain families. In the Eastern Woodland cultures of North America, there wasan effort to preserve genetic lines sustaining, among other things, certainphysical characteristics giving rise to a class of nobility over time. Long inpolitical power, family members received chieftainships and the dutiesaffiliated with seats of influence.” 1 The unique traits of the Tall Ones were recognised by early societies and mayhave been seen as an important, possibly divine or royal bloodline they weredetermined to nurture and maintain. Even if this were the case, where they camefrom is another matter. Perhaps a good starting point would be to take a look atthe early migrations of Native Americans to start to piece together the greater“giant” puzzle. Myths and Migrations Creation myths and oral histories describing the migrations of certain tribesmay be a factor in determining the origins of these mighty giants. For example,the Sioux, Iroquois and Cherokee all have creation myths, and all have storiesof giants. Chief Attakullakulla’s speech to the Cherokee Nation in 1750 said: “We traveled here from the rising sun, before the time of the stone age man.” 2 The origin of the Iroquois has been lost in the depths of time, but during the1700s their descendants related stories to Catholic priests that they came fromthe east after being destroyed by a great flood.3 The possible relation to thelegendary Atlantis will be expanded on later in this chapter. “Native American traditions clearly narrate of very tall and impressivelyconstructed men and women whose lives and deeds became the stuff of legends tothe old tribal families. They were a royal class who were descended from aremotely ancient clan of spiritually realized stock such as the Cherokee Nunnéhior the Choctaw Nahúlo.” 4 Choctaw tradition states that the Lenape (the archaeological Adena) originatedsomewhere in the far west of the continent and migrated en masse towards therising sun. Vine Deloria Jr. called it the “great exodus” (see Legends of theTall Ones chapter). The Algonquin-speaking Lenape were also said to have comefrom the western part of America and migrated eastwards.Modern scholars tell us that all of North America was considered to be calledTurtle Island,5 although in hindsight the Lenape may have been seeking TurtleIsland, the land of their ancestors. This passage is from the oral history ofthe Iroquois: “Sky Woman fell down to the earth when it was covered with water. Variousanimals tried to swim to the bottom of the ocean to bring back dirt to createland. Muskrat succeeded in gathering dirt, which was placed on the back of aturtle, which grew into the land known today as North America.” 6 The Hopi believe they originated in America and are among its oldestinhabitants. There is an interesting passage in their elaborate myths that mayalso describe a so-called land bridge: “Masaw told them that the northern area would be the back door to the new world,this new continent, and that in the future many people would come into this newland via this back door. But they would do so without Masaw’s permission.”7 Native Americans, however, as a general rule, oppose the land bridge theory asit does not reflect their ancient traditions passed down by their ancestors overmany generations. Vine Deloria summarises the situation: “Some tribes speak of transoceanic migrations in boats, the Hopis and Colvillesfor example, and others speak of the experience of a creation, such as theYakimas and other Pacific Northwest tribes. Some tribes even talk aboutmigrations from other planets.” 8 The Bering Land Bridge The migration from Asia over the Bering land bridge is the fixed scientificperspective regarding the origins of Native Americans. This, however, is nowunder intense scrutiny on many fronts. It was first proposed in 1590 by José deAcosta and has been widely accepted since the 1930s.Peopling_of_America_through_Beringia.bmp [../Images/image00543.jpeg] Dr. Aleš Hrdlička of the Smithsonian was involved in championing the theory ofthe Bering land bridge as he was convinced all humans came from a common sourcethat was not in America. Hrdlička was also fond of the theory of evolution, andas we know, was not interested in anything dating back beyond 2,000 BC until in1927 his contemporaries pointed out that the Folsom Points were dated to around8,000 - 9,000 B.C. (See The Smithsonian Files chapter). Soon after the landbridge theory was in full swing, a new theory emerged when ‘Clovis’ points werediscovered in New Mexico. Over the next few years virtually all states had foundClovis evidence, so a neat and tidy theory that Siberian nomads entered Americaaround 9,500 BC via the land bridge became the norm, and continued without muchresistance from academia until the mid-twentieth centuryThe Clovis Barrier (an invisible wall against new ideas, protecting theprevailing theory) held strong for decades, but when in 1958 a discovery wasmade in Lewisville, Texas, with what appeared to be Clovis fluted pointsdiscovered in a layer that was at least 38,000 years old, the barrier crumbled.Then in 1997 Tom Dillehay discovered Monte Verde in Chile, with radiocarbondates going back to at least 1,000 years before Clovis. This pretty muchtriggered the full collapse of the so-called Clovis Barrier. But more was tocome. Two Migrations Via the Land Bridge There is now a theory that there were two migrations via the Bering land bridge.One at the very earliest time of around 20,000 years ago9 and the “Amerind”(American Indian) migration was said to have come over at 9,500 BC. The humanswho arrived at that time are said to be the direct ancestors of the NorthAmerican Indian. However, it is very unclear who originally crossed the landbridge 20,000 years ago, but they may well have been the descendents of themysterious Denisovans who were known to have existed in northern Siberia—whichis especially interesting as their DNA has been found in some Native Americanpopulations. We will explore the connection to this culture soon, but whoeverthey were, it has been postulated that they may have had features resemblingmodern humans.10As part of his research Dr. Dennis Stanford investigated the proposed area ofSiberia that the original Native Americans were said to have come from, and alsothe area of the land bridge. He found no Clovis evidence whatsoever. Stanford isan archaeologist and Director of the Paleoindian/Paleoecology Program at theNational Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution. Along withProf. Bruce Bradley, he is known for advocating the Solutrean hypothesis, whichcontends that stone tool technology of the Solutrean culture in prehistoricEurope may have influenced the development of the Clovis tool-making culture inthe Americas. Therefore, they postulated that the Solutreans traveled across theAtlantic, hugging the ice-sheet until they reached America around 15,000 yearsago.Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the country, early travellers were settlingin on the California Channel Islands. West Coast Seafaring Origins We have already seen that the Channel Islands may have had very early humanoccupation, which also suggests they were seafarers and proficient hunters, whowe also know were fairly tall, with some reports suggesting a height of 9 feet 2inches (see Further Afield chapter). Red and blond haired traits are alsosometimes evident, not only on the coast, but inland such as in Nevada and thesouthwest states and even into Sonora in Mexico. The dating of the mummies andartifacts as far back as 9,000 BC do suggest that this area of North America wasinhabited by taller than average, with (some) red and blond haired tribes, witha robust Cro-Magnon skull type that has been compared to modern humans. Theextremely ancient dates that are arising have consequently caused muchcontroversy.The proposed 12,200 year old discoveries on Santa Rosa Island are at least 1,000years older than the famous Clovis Culture.11 Their intricate stone tools showthat they were a completely separate culture to the Folsom and Clovis.Radiocarbon dates suggest that prehistoric man also inhabited San Miguel, one ofthe Northern Channel Islands as long ago as 10,700 years. About 18,000 years agothese northern islands were connected to each other as one large island thatscientists call Santarosae, with possible occupation as long ago as 40,000years.12Were these islands the origin point of the tribes that carried the ‘giant’traits, and migrated east to flourish for the proceeding millennia? However,from where did these islanders originate?Australasia and Melanesian influences are now thought to have occurred in SouthAmerica going back 23,000 years, and even as far back as 50,000 years. In 1999Walter Neves studied skulls found in Brazil and concluded they were ofAustralian Aboriginal or Melanesian origin. In July of 2015 brand new researchbacked this up.13 The 2015 paper hinted at multiple migrations, but confirmedthat Native American DNA had some connections to these original sources.Before we explore the deep antiquity of many of these potential ancestors of thegiants, some discoveries further south along the west coast to Baja Californiamay provide some clues. Baja California and Mexican Origins The western edge of America and the Southwest states could have been influencednot only by incoming migrants from Australisia and Melanesia, and thelarge-statured Seri and Sonora tribes (that we discussed in the Early Explorersand Sonora chapters), but also by the taller-than-average Guaycura Indians ofBaja California, who had distinct similarities to their giant Patagoniancousins: “The Guaycura Indians were native to our area and as legend has it that, the menwere used for procreation and the tribe was run by their Amazon Queen, QueenCalafia. Some schools of thought have it that after her, California was named.She was quite famous as evidenced by the use of her name ‘Calafia’ throughoutBaja and Mainland Mexico. Also the Guaycura Indians were tall, over 6’ tall andlooked like no other Indian in any part of Baja or Mainland Mexico. There is norecord of any Indian anywhere in the western hemisphere that has any likelinessto them. Due to the fact of their resemblances to the seafaring voyagers of thePacific Islanders, and the similar latitude to the Hawaiian Islands, there ismore than a possibility that they were direct descendants of Polynesianseafarers attempting to find the Hawaiian Islands that had blown off course andlanded at southern Baja California and settling there. You will notice as youobserve the local people of the area you will see an amount of tall slender darkhaired Indians, these are descendants of the original Guaycuras. By 1767,virtually all the Guaycura Indians in the area had died either of Europeandiseases or in skirmishes with the Spanish.”14 An area slightly further south is known today as San Jose del Cabo. It wasoriginally inhabited by the Pericúes. Although the oldest Pericú remains aredated at 3,000 years old, archaeological evidence extends as far back as 11,000years ago.15 “Their skull morphology and recent genetic studies led by Dr. Silvia Gonzalezstrengthen the theory that the Pericúes did not originate in Northern Asia,where some experts believed Native Americans first came from. Instead, thePericues are closer to the ancient populations of southern Asia, Australia, andthe South Pacific Rim. The Peñon Woman discovered near Mexico City and dated at12,700 - 15,000 years BP, among the oldest human remains recovered in theAmericas so far, has similar cranial morphology to the Pericues. The same skullconfiguration is also found at Lagoa Santa in Brazil and in Patagonia.” 15 Are the Patagonians, who we know were giant in stature, of the same origins asthe giants of the west coast of North America? Did they come from the same stockeither by sea or the land bridge? With more scientific research being carriedout, the more it looks like those with these traits were inhabiting the southerntip of South America, all the way up to North America. “The distinctive hyperdolichocephalic (long-headed) skulls found in Cape Regionburials have suggested to some scholars that the ancestors of the Pericú wereeither trans-Pacific immigrants or remnants of some of the New World’s earliestcolonizers.” 16 Much like the mighty Patagonians, the Pericúes of Baja California were tallerand stronger than the average Mexican and were noted for their strength andphysique.pericues-reviolt-Martirio_de_Lorenzo_Carranco.bmp [../Images/image00544.jpeg] Image: Martyrdom of Lorenzo Carranco, at the beginning of the Pericú Revolt inSantiago de los Coras de Añiñí, 1st October 1734. Notice the size of thePericuan Indians.A DNA study that took place in 2004 concluded that the two oldest knownAmericans; Peñon woman (in Mexico) and Kennewick Man (in Washington) might havebelonged to the Pericú tribe (or were at least distantly related) as their skulltypes are remarkably similar—long andnarrow (dolicocephalic)—very different from classical Native Americantraits.These surprising discoveries certainly suggest that sea-faring was a veryancient skill, and these same skills have also been found on the CaliforniaChannel Islands. The fact that all these cultures may have been exceptionallytall (based on the skeletal remains found on these Islands, and ancientlegends), can no longer be ignored. The Pericúes were thus described: “The missionary descriptions indicated that the men were naked and the womenwore grass skirts, and they were very tall and slim.” 17 They also used copious amounts of tobacco in their ceremonies, and their burialcustoms were deeply reminiscent of what we have seen in the burial customs ofthe mortuary mound-building giants all over North America: “Gonzalez indicated that they had a complex burial system involvingmortuary-like burial areas located both along the coast and in caves. She saidthey also used wooden spear throwers, and likely painted bones with red ochre,as early decorated shells and pearls have been found in Baja.” 18 The report emphasised that there was “very strong evidence that the firstmigration came from Australia via Japan and Polynesia and down the Pacific coastof America.” This is now backed-up by modern science, and they could well havebeen distantly related to the mysterious Denisovans. Denisovan Genes in America The Denisovans are still a virtually invisible culture that could well be theancient ancestors of the Patagonians and the Pericú. We featured the Denisovansin Search for the Lost Giants with researcher Terje Dahl. Author Andrew Collinswas the first to publish a detailed analysis of the mysterious Denisovans andtheir possible traits relating to the giants of North America.19Spread_and_evolution_of_Denisovans.bmp [../Images/image00545.jpeg]In 2008 Russian archaeologists found a fragment of a large finger bone of ayoung female in a remote cave in the Altai Mountains of northern Siberia. “Thesingle finger bone is unusually broad and robust, well outside the variationseen in modern people.”20 The cave and its contents were originally dated toaround 41,000 years old, but new results (published in September 2015) stretchthe dates back to between 50,000 and 170,000 years ago.21 The original 41,000year old discoveries included the finger bone, and two teeth, and a veryinteresting finely finished obsidian bracelet, like the world had never seenbefore. But crucially, the DNA analysis of the finger bone created a worldwidesensation and the discovery of a completely unknown extinct human species knownas the Denisovans.The two teeth that were discovered (from separate individuals) have gotgiantologists talking. The molars are much larger than normal, with one having achewing surface twice that of a modern human.Denisovan-teeth-compare.psd [../Images/image00546.jpeg]ep5-denisovan-tooth2.bmp [../Images/image00547.jpeg] Images above: Modern molar on left with width of 10.67 mm. The Denisovan toothon the right with width of 14.7mm. Photo of human molar compared to Denisovantooth replica in Shara Bailey’s office. When the tooth was initially discovered, Max Planck Institutepaleoanthropologist Bence Viola mistook it for that of a cave bear’s tooth. Onlywhen its DNA was tested was it confirmed otherwise. “It shows you how weirdthese guys are,” he said. “...their teeth are just very strange.”22 Giants in South Africa Andrew Collins also investigated a 400,000-year-old femur from a cave called theSima de los Huesos (‘Pit of Bones’) in northern Spain. It belongs to an extinctspecies of hominin known as Homo heidelbergensis, who occupied Africa and muchof the Eurasian continent between 800,000 and 200,000 years ago (‘hominin’ isdefined as the group consisting of modern humans, extinct human species and allour immediate ancestors). “...anthropologists have always considered that the closest ancestor to Homoheidelbergensis was the Neanderthal. Yet an examination of the mitochondrial DNAfrom the Homo heidelbergensis femur found in Spain revealed it to be much closerto that of the Denisovans.” 23 This is intriguing because although they were on average no taller than 5 ft 10in (170 cm), another branch of their population were much larger. Professor LeeR. Burger of the University of Witwatersrand has examined numerous fossil bonesbelonging to Homo heidelbergensis populations that inhabited South Africabetween 500,000 and 300,000 years ago and has discovered that these were oftenover seven feet (2.13 meters) in height. Burger states: “Everywhere we find them we find them enormous. These are what we call archaicHomo sapiens. Some people refer to them as Homo heidelbergensis. Theseindividuals are extraordinary, they are giants.” 24 This was further investigated by author Michael Tellinger who visited theUniversity and met with Prof. Francis Thackery to take a closer look at thebone. It was discovered in the 1960s along with several other bones, at theOtavi Mountains in Namibia. There were more bones from the skeleton but thesewere never collected. Thackary emphasises that it is from an “anatomicallymodern human” or Homo sapiens, and who lived “within the last 100,000 years”(not 200,000 years as Burger suggested). He explained that “In my experiencehaving traveled through museums around the world, I have never seen a humanfemur this big.” He conluded that it was “twice the size” of a standard humanfemur.25So here we have it! At last an academic—Professor Francis Thackery of theUniversity of Witwatersrand—actually stating on camera that this femur is from ahuman being that was twice the size of a modern human. This would mean a heightof between ten and twelve feet (which is way beyond the seven-foot heightdescribed by Professor Burger.The discovery of a potentially twelve-foot tall Homo heidelbergensis specimen iscompelling, because the Denisovans were their distant decendants. This basicallymeans that Denisovans could well have been the same height as Homoheidelbergensis, especially when we consider the “robust” finger bone and the“large teeth” that have a chewing surface twice that of a normal human. So couldthis mean they were also 10 - 12 feet tall? Maybe not, but the evidence of thesebizarre bones in Africa at least proves that giants actually existed on earth.The discovery of a huge jawbone in the Penghu Islands off the coast Taiwan hasalso confirmed the existence of giants in Denisovan territory. Taiwanesefishermen may have uncovered from the sea floor, an unknown type of human thatlived anywhere between 200,000 years ago and 10,000 years ago. “Width of thebone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm (0.8 inches) for Penghu, buton average 14 mm (0.55 inches) for fossil modern humans.”26 This is about athird larger than a modern human, so the owner of the mighty jaw could have beenup to nine feet tall.Considering Denisovans existed fairly close to here, we must consider this maybe a significant discovery in relation to giant genes entering North America inthe distant past, and may indicate they were indeed capable of seafaring. Moreresearch is currently being carried out, but until confirmed by science we canspeculate that this is quite possibly the jaw of a Denisovan. Double Rows of Teeth (Part 2) Neanderthals occupied many of the same regions as the Denisovans, from SoutheastAsia to as far east as the Altai Mountains of southern-central Siberia. Therehave been numerous reports of their skulls being found with taurodontism, astrange dental anomaly similar to some of those described in the Double Rows ofTeeth chapter: “Like hyperdontia, to which it is related, taurodontism is considered a geneticabnormality that results in the enlargement of teeth out of proportion to theroots of the jaw. The cause of taurodontism is not properly understood, and isexplained, variously, as a genetic mutation, a pituitary malfunction or even anevolutionary throwback.” 27 Most interestingly the Wikipedia page directly states that people suffering withthis condition could have also had “multiple teeth.”Almost every member of the human population outside of Africa has one to fourpercent Neanderthal DNA28 and the Denisovans are their close cousins. “The current Melanesians, represented by the Pacific islanders of Papua NewGuinea, and Aboriginal Australians, all show between four and six percentDenisovan DNA.29 Other human populations, such as the Burmans, Malays, HanChinese, and Polynesians, also have Denisovan DNA, but in far smallerquantities.” 30 This is intriguing as this is the geographic region where the Denisovans andNeanderthals mated with Homo Sapiens, along with an unknown humanoid that AndrewCollins calls Species-X (not to be confused with haplogroup X, that we discussin the next section). No doubt the gene pool became more complicated at thistime in this area. Migration and mating were the favourite pastimes of theancients so it could be that their genetic markers made their way over toAmerica. Genetic throwbacks such as increased height, large teeth, supernumeraryteeth, and powerful skeletal frames due to hybridization—all could have been aregular occurrence.Collins speculates that the genuine accounts we cover in this book most likelyrefer to human or hominin hybrids who carry strong Denisovan-human orDenisovan-Neanderthal-human genetic markers. He also believes it is possiblethat the giants of North America contain DNA belonging to Species X, who are nowbelieved to have bred with all three other sub-species—Denisovans, Neanderthalsand archaic humans.31 This in turn may have caused various mutations.Interestingly, the “archaic humans” or “Cro-Magnon” (those skeletons discoveredin Europe), were surprisingly tall, had massive jaws, high cheekbones andthicker skulls—traits of many of the North American giants—but where did theytruly originate?Double rows of teeth seem to be an indicator of something unusual hidden withinthe genes of the giants. As Shara Bailey, NYU dental anthropologist pointed out,the size of the head and jaw may be the genetic trigger for extra teeth to grow,as there is the space to do so. The temptation to simply ignore all the reportsof DRTs and their possible connections to the ancient Denisovans and otherancient cultures around the world has to be challenged. Red-Haired Giants It has become known that the Neanderthals—who were breeding with the Denisovansin Siberia—routinely had red or auburn hair. Almost every member of the humanpopulation has 1% - 4% Neanderthal DNA. However, the Neanderthals were in no waygiants. A mutation that may have resulted in red hair and light skin amongNeanderthals has been discovered, according to the Smithsonian Museum of NaturalHistory. Two Neanderthals—one from Italy and one from Spain—had a mutation in agene controlling hair and skin color. “The mutation changes an amino acid, making the resulting protein lessefficient. Modern humans have other MCR1 variants that are also less active,resulting in red hair and pale skin. The less active Neanderthal mutationprobably also resulted in red hair and pale skin, as in modern humans.” 32 It is also known that South Pacific islanders are powerfully built and oftentaller than the world average. In addition, red-haired traits still exist inplaces such as Easter Island, Tonga and Vanuatu. The western edge of Peru andChile has prolific evidence of red and auburn-haired tribes with extremelyelongated skulls from remote antiquity. In fact some of the oldest mummies onearth were found in Chile, with the earliest example dating to a staggering9,020 years old,33 contemporary with Spirit Cave Man in Nevada (9,400 yearsold).Further ‘red-heads’ have been found preserved in another way on the southeasttip of America. The Florida bog mummies were originally discovered in 1982 atTitusville, a few miles from Cape Canaveral. These submerged mummies also hadred and auburn hair and were found in an incredible state of preservation. Theywere carbon dated to 8,280 years.34 Although these inhabitants did not reachover 5 ft 8 in, at another site called Warm Springs in the city of North Port,some skeletons reached the height of 6 ft 2 in. The most compelling aspect ofthese discoveries is that intact brain matter was DNA tested and the Titusvillemummy-genome contained haplogroup X, which is a distinct DNA marker originatingfrom Europe and the Middle East. European DNA in America Haplogroup X is particularly intriguing because not only is it present in 3% ofNative Americans, in Europe and the Middle East 2% - 4% of people carry thisgene, primarily in parts of Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy and Israel.35Certain tribes in southern Siberia also carry the “X” type36 (that has causedsome confusion to academics regarding early migrations). It seems thisparticular gene may play an important role in understanding the origins of thegiants in North America, especially migrations that came from the east.Archaeologists Robert L. Kelly and Dabid Hurst Thomas summed it up: “Some geneticists and archaeologists suggest that haplogroup X points to anancient migration from Europe, in addition toones from Asia.” 371870%e2%80%99s%20photo%20of%20the%20tall%20Iroquois%20%20chief%20John%20Wampum.bmp[../Images/image00548.jpeg] Image: 1870’s photo of the tall Iroquois chief John Wampum. Haplogroup X is said to have entered America from the east as long as 34,000years ago. At around 14,000 - 12,000 years ago they arrived in much greaternumbers. This could well have been the Solutreans, mentioned earlier in thischapter, who have been put forward as some of the first explorers to enterAmerica from Europe.Haplogroup X was found in the Florida bog mummies (8,280 years old), but it isalso found in tribes that once inhabited the northern tier of North America. Asmall amount is found among the Na-Dene-speaking Navaho, the Sioux and Yakima onthe northwest Pacific coast, and Algonquian speaking tribes in the North East.38It occurs to a larger degree in the Oneota, Nuu-Chah-Nulth and Ojibwa of theGreat Lakes.39 Most of these tribes are affiliated with the Iroquois, althoughthe origins and the language of the Iroquois Nation tribes are disputed byscholars. Some myths state they came from the northeast after a great flooddestroyed their civilization in prehistory,40 whilst a faction of the Iroquoissay they came from within a ‘sacred mountain’ (personal communication betweenChief Jake Swamp and Ross Hamilton). As we have seen from the historical record,most of these Iroquois tribes had giants among them. Migration from the Great Lakes There are some tantalising possibilities that these tribes around the GreatLakes region may have had members of exceptional height—and even had double rowsof teeth—going as far back as 6,000 years. Tribes in the Middle Great Lakes/St.Lawrence culture area, from Southern Ontario, Southern Québec, and SouthwesternNew Brunswick between 4000 and 1000 BC, were taller than their neighbors. Menwere around six feet (180.7 centimeters), while the women reached around fiveand a half feet (170 cm).41 This was much taller that the local inhabitants ofthe area.A strange twist in this story that Andrew Collins commented on was that over aperiod of one millennium, they actually increased in height. Now, they only grewon average one-inch during a one thousand year period, but this is still veryinteresting because it shows a trait of extreme growth that may show earlyevidence of genetic abnormalities, in addition to selective breeding, a customthat potentially continued into the mound building cultures of North America. “The traditional belief that there were men of giant stature among the ancientIroquois is apparently true. Archaeologically however the evidence no longer isavailable for study, and even if the Iroquois had knowledge of such remains,they likely would not relate their location.” 42 Some of the taller-than-average people from the tribes around the Great Lakeswere known to have had, “...hyperdontia, or extra teeth... a genetic trait... biological...” 43 In the Double Rows of Teeth chapter, we discuss this trait found in skulls allover North America, and now we can see where it may have originated, but whetherthese were related to the Denisovans is unclear. However, these could well havebeen the Archaic Allegheny people who were known to be of giant stature and weresaid to come from this area. Keeping the Gene Pool Tall With all this human hybridization taking place in the distant past, genetictraits could have been formed by various mutations, generating extra sets ofteeth, double-teeth, or extra single teeth, extreme height, and other anomaliesassociated with the American giants. The Archaic Allegheny people (whom RossHamilton calls the Allehana), could have been the early ancestors of the MoundBuilders who carried these genetic markers with them and selectively bred toenhance and continue these traits. Such genetic throwbacks might be seen as adisadvantage in today’s world, but in the ancient lands of North America thesecharacteristics could easily have been revered by the giant elite. Perhaps itwas for this reason they maintained the purity of their bloodlines byinterbreeding only with others in the elite royal class—or those with theseunique features. This would have improved the chances of the genes to becomestronger and more consistent over time. “...having a firm genetic base in the stature of seven feet, even taller menpossessing a healthy physicality may have lived throughout Illinois, Indiana,Pennsylvania, etc.” 44 Haplogroup X is not fully understood, as few tribes have been DNA tested inNorth America. The proximity of where haplogroup X is found, combined with theflood and migration myths already discussed in this chapter, does open the doorfor another controversial theory. The Giants of Atlantis Did giant people once populate the mythical lost continent of Atlantis, who thendispersed to multiple locations, including North America, after a cataclysm? Asmentioned in the Mystics and Secrets Societies chapter, the Rosicrucian’s,Freemasons, Theosophists, Rudolph Steiner, and Edgar Cayce all spoke of theexistence of Atlantis as an historical fact. Surprisingly, they all assertedthat giant humans were also part of the population of the lost island continent.No ‘lost continent’ has been discovered as yet, but many of Cayce’s readingstelling of giants entering North America do sometimes correlate with what wehave uncovered in this chapter. “The geographical origin of haplogroup X is unknown, although it is found inareas around the Atlantic Ocean, where Edgar Cayce reports Atlanteans settled.When researchers from Trinity College tested individuals in Ireland forhaplogroup X they discovered that the relatively isolated Irish on the far westcoast of that country, closest to where Atlantis was, have the highestconcentration of this type.” 45 As we mentioned previously haplogroup X was said to have entered America around34,000 years ago and again at around 12,000 - 14,000 years ago. Edgar Caycedescribes large numbers of Atlanteans leaving their stricken land at roughlyboth these times: “Scientists say haplogroup X may be of European origin. They are unwilling todesignate Atlantis as a site of origin since it does not exist. It is verypossible that when humans with haplogroup X genes departed from the centralpoint of Atlantis, some went to the American continent in the west and otherstraveled to Europe. This would explain the striking similarities between thetools and customs of the Solutrean people of southwestern Europe and the Clovispeople on the North America continent.” 46The astonishing thing about all this is that haplorgoup X is found in—and onlyin—the areas that Cayce claims that Atlantean refugees landed. It sounds likescience fiction, but there is no harder science that genetics. It is worthnoting that the Iroqouis tribes have been found to have up to 25% haplogroup X.Author Greg Little tells us what Cayce had to say about the Iroquois: “Cayce indicated that the largest migration from Atlantis occurred just before10,000 BC. The majority of these Atlantean survivors went to the Northeasterncoastal areas of America and Canada becoming the Iroquois. It should be recalledthat Cayce also stated that not all of the Iroquois were Atlantean. TheAtlanteans migrating to the Americas merged with the people already present inAmerica by that time. The Atlanteans became leaders of the tribes.” 47Athanasius Kircher’s map of Atlantis in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. FromMundus Subterraneus 1669, published in Amsterdam. The map is oriented with southat the top.Athanasius_Kircher%27s_Atlantis.bmp [../Images/image00549.jpeg] Another compelling piece of information comes from the Cayce readings regardingthe Atlantean connection to the Mound Builders. Reading 3004-15, states thefollowing: “There the entity was the priestess. And there may be seen some of thoseactivities that are a part of the awareness to some in that land of Ohio, wherethere were those plans for such, in the mounds that were called the replica orrepresentative of the Yucatan experiences, as well as the Atlantean and in Gobiland. All of these are as one consciousness in the entity’s activity.” It is stated that many of the Mound Builder structures were representations ofwhat once existed in Atlantis, used for ritual and ceremonial purposes. Thesoutheastern section of the Portsmouth, Ohio earthwork (now destroyed), is astartling match of Plato’s description of the central city of Atlantis.Portsmouth_Works_Group_C_Squier_and_Davis_01.jpg [../Images/image00550.jpeg]Portsmouth Works group C. Squier and Davis.Cayce gave a total of 68 readings that had a connection to the Mound Builders.Here are two of his readings, showing the importance of the Ohio River Valley asthe heart of the great mound building empire. From reading 3528-22: “The entity was among those of the second generation of Atlanteans who strugglednorthward from Yucatan, settling in what is now a portion of Kentucky, Indiana,Ohio; being among those of the earlier period known as Mound Builders.” Reading 3393-29: “Before this the entity was in the land east from the present nativity, or inthe settlings in the land when there were the Mound builders in Ohio, Indiana,and the various groups that traveled through that land.” Edgar Cayce’s information about humanity’s past—which at the time was consideredpreposterous—is now being verified by science. Take, for instance, the ancienttemple site of Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, which has been dated to an astonishing9,600 BC. This date, coupled with the sophisticated construction, was consideredunthinkable up until the time of its discovery in 1994.This is also the area of the biblical ‘Watchers’ who were said to have overseenhumanity and seeded a legendary race of giants called the ‘Nephilim’. Ashaplogroup X has also been found in this area, this may prove fruitful for thosethat believe the so-called Nephilim made their way from the Bible lands to thecoasts of North America. Nephilim and Biblical Giants in America Genesis 6:4: “There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare childrento them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.” This passage from the Bible is talking about the offspring of “sons of God” whoare called the ‘Nephilim’—offspring of the legendary ‘Watchers’ and humanfemales. If you Google ‘giant skeletons’, more often than not the word Nephilimcomes up, with webpages stating the giants of North America are in fact the verysame giants featured in the Bible. Various authors such as Steve Quayle, FritzZimmerman, and L.A. Marzulli are convinced that the North American giantsoriginated from the Middle East, or the ‘Bible Lands,’ and they were pushed outby the warring Israelites spearheaded by Moses. These giants then fled andsettled in America.We are perhaps being too simplistic here, as all these authors and othergiantologists who promote the idea of the Nephilim have actually carried outsome very interesting research, but first, we must determine who exactlyNephilim were.The word Nephilim originally appeared in the Torah, or Hebrew Bible—our OldTestament—and roughly translates as ‘Those who fell, those who came down, thosewho left one place to go to another.’ It does not mean ‘Fallen Angels.’ The nameis also used in reference to giants who inhabited Canaan at the time of theIsraelite conquest according to Numbers 13:33.48 Nephilim is also a general termused to describe multiple giant races and individuals in the Bible. For example,the Amalekites, Amorites, Anakim, Ashdothites, Aviums, Avites, Canaanites,Caphtorim, Ekronites, Emins, Eshkalonites, Gazathites, Geshurites, Gibeonites,Giblites, Girgashites, Gittites, Hittites, Hivites, Horim, Horites, Jebusites,Kadmonites, Kenizzites, Maachathites, Manassites, Nephilim, Perizzites,Philistines, Rephaim, Sidonians, Zamzummim, Zebusites and Zuzim.There are also 22 individual giants mentioned by name: Adonizedec —King ofJerusalem; Agag—King of the Amalakites; Ahiman; Amalek; Arba; Beelesath; Gog andMagog; Gogmagog; Goliath; Hoham—King of Hebron; Horam—King of Gezer; Jabin—Kingof Hazor; Jobab—King of Madon; Lahmi; Nimrod; Og of Bashan; Ogias—Og’s father;Perizzites; Sheshai; Sihon—King of the Amorites; Sippai and Talmai.49Some notable giants include King Og of Bashan who was the last of the Rephaim (aHebrew name for giants), and an Amorite King. He had a iron bedstead (orsarcophagus) measuring nine cubits in length and four cubits in width, which is13.5 ft by 6 ft according to the standard cubit of a man, that would make himsomewhere between 9 to 13 feet in height. Goliath and his three brothers ofGath, are known as sons of the Nephilim. After killing Goliath, David and hisbrothers hunted down Goliath’s brothers and became the first literal gianthunters in history!Og%27s_Bed_(crop).jpg [../Images/image00551.jpeg]Image: An old illustration of Og’s gigantic bed. The non-canonical (Apocrypha) books of Baruch 3:22–28 and Sirach 16:6–9 indicatethat giants (Greek; gigantes, gigantōn, respectively) previously lived in theland of Canaan before Moses conquered them.50This is referring to when Moses was heading-up to the “Promised Land” during theExodus. They moved north along the west coast of Israel and up into Lebanon.They met with giants and eventually defeated them, but where did the giants findexile?Ancient Babylon (and the area north of there) was the home of the Amorites, atleast one of whom could be described thus:“whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was as strong as theoaks.”51 The idea that the Amorites were giants is supported by the report ofthe spies whom Moses sent through the land of Canaan. The Amorites were one ofthe groups they saw, and they claimed that “all the people whom we saw in it aremen of great stature.”52 It is telling that in their response, Joshua and Calebdid not challenge the size of the land’s inhabitants.53 In Numbers 13:33 itstated: “And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants[Nephilim] and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in theirsight.” The giants obviously were not wiped out by Moses and his army, as around 600 AD,further reports of over-eight-foot warriors emerged in the Greek historiesciting King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in his campaign against Jerusalem: “...killing a warrior who lacked only one palm’s breath of five royal cubits.”54(This equates to 8 feet 4 inches).Zimmerman’s book The Nephilim Chronicles: Fallen Angels in the Ohio Valley(2012), gives a lengthy argument that those driven out of the Bible Lands werethe Amorites. This tall, megalith-building culture would have traveled along theIberian Peninsula, up through Europe, and eventually become known as the BeakerPeople. After arriving in the British Isles, Zimmerman tells us they builthundreds of mounds and may even have built Stonehenge. They were skilled metaltraders, and were on the hunt for tin in England. Somewhere along the line, theysailed to North America and into the Great Lakes area to mine copper. Somestayed, and this was the genesis of the North American race of giants.Other authors skip the convoluted part about the Amorites and Beaker people andsay they simply came straight over to North America (Marzulli, Quayle etc).Whatever the case, there are several accounts of giant skeletal remains andartifacts in the area of the “Nephilim” in the Middle East that we have in ourrecords.Skull-types get heavily investigated by Zimmerman who proposes that the classicAdena skull type: large jaw, high cheekbones, thick skull wall, and largefeatures, are the same as the Amorites/Beaker People and later the Phoenicians.It’s an interesting theory, as there are some similarities in burial customs,mound styles and skull features, but when put under scrutiny certain aspectsfall short. However, the authors do recommend the book, as it has hundreds ofgiant accounts from all over the world and has been thoroughly researched.L.A. Marzulli books include On the Trail of the Nephilim (2013)and not only dothe American giants get put forward as Nephilim, but the elongated skullsdiscovered in Peru do too­—even though they are not giant in any way. He islooking for evidence in all parts of the Americas and suggests most megalithicstructures and earthworks were constructed by these biblical giants (or Peruvianconeheads) emphasising that they were not Native American in any way.Steve Quayle was the first modern author to propose that giants from all partsof the world are the offspring of the biblical giants. His enormous book is athorough chronicle of historic and modern giants, and emphasises, like Marzulli,that they were responsible for worldwide megalithic construction. They were notparticularly pleasant, and ruled various cultures often in a violent manner.55Finally, a curious artifact was witnessed in 1877 that does suggest a directconnection to the Bible Lands (that any Nephilim advocate should use as part oftheir evidence). After his surrender, Chief Joseph, a renowned Nez Perce leaderhanded over a small pendent to General Miles and after a few years it wasinspected and turned out to be an ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet. It wastranslated by Robert Biggs, professor of Assyriology at the Oriental Instituteof the University of Chicago who found that it was a sales receipt for a lambdating back to 2042 BC. “The chief said that the tablet had been passed down in his family for manygenerations, and that they had inherited it from their white ancestors. ChiefJoseph said that white men had come among his ancestors long ago.” 56Chief_Joseph-1877.bmp [../Images/image00552.jpeg]Chief Joseph in 1877 and cuneiform tablet. The Watchers and the Nunnehim The Nephilim and the Watchers from the Bible have their counterparts among theAlgonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan speaking peoples, and possibly the Muskogeon.The Native Cherokee Nunnehim (Nunnehi), and the Lakota Watchers are containedwithin the traditions of the great conclave of Native American culture. Thisstretched from the Dakotas across the Great Lakes to the eastern tribes and downto the Great South and the “Five Civilized Tribes.” They all apparently havetheir own versions of the Watchers and the Nephilim.The Nunnehim are believed to be the survivors of a great country in the ocean tothe east. Their origins are said to be in the Atlantic basin going back manythousands of years. When the basin began to flood under the water of meltingglaciers, these blessed people moved into the Americas as well as Europe and theMediterranean, bringing with them the sacred spiritual technologies of theAntediluvian world. Many of them were said to have been giants in stature. Likethe post-Atlantean legend of the Tuatha Dé Danann from ancient Ireland, theywithdrew back into the hills and the subconscious mind, leaving their lands toIndigenous folk. The Watchers are the wisdom keepers among the Nunnehim. Lakotatradition to this day suggests that they have their lodges of habitationstrategically placed in order to look out for, and to protect the Native Tribes.This tradition of the Nunnehi and the Watchers predates any known outsideinfluence including the Nephilim of the Bible.According to the traditions of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek andSeminoles, the Nunnehi are revered as, “...traditionalists, historians, artists and, musicians...they are able tophysically alter their size and appearance.” 57 American Genesis One theory that usually gets overlooked in regard to the origins of the giantsis the idea that they originated in America. Many Native creation myths alludeto this. One example is in the writings of Tuscarora David Cusick in his bookSix Nations (1825). He states that when the Great Spirit made the people, someof them became giants. “It seems that the tall people at least shared the status of being the firstinhabitants of Indian memory, and that the smaller-in-stature folk lived amongor in proximity to them from remotely ancient times.” 58 Some of these creation myths may now have scientific discoveries to back them upas human remains and artifacts in the Americas are much older than originallythought. “The Sandia Cave discoveries, along with the finds made at Hueyatlaco, Calico,and Toca da Esperanca, strongly suggest a human presence over 200,000 years agoin the Americas. This challenges not only the orthodox time estimate for theentry of Homo sapiens into North America (12,000 years ago) but also the wholepicture of human evolution, which has Homo sapiens arising from Homo erectus inAfrica about 100,000 years ago.”59 Hueyatlaco in Mexico is famous because some incredibly old evidence of humanoccupation was recorded in the 1960s. Sophisticated stone tools and artifactswere dated to a quarter of a million years old by a team from the United StatesGeological Survey.60 Inside Sandia Cave in New Mexico stone implements similarto Folsom points were discovered in 1975. However these were also dated to250,000 years old. In Calico, Southern California, stone tools dating to 200,000years ago were discovered in 1964. In Toca da Esperanca in Brazil, furtherdiscoveries were found to be of a similar age.61Extremely ancient artifacts have been discovered all over the Americas, andhuman remains that go back even further have shaken the foundations of academia,and have raised serious questions regarding the origins of modern human beings.The most striking problem is that of modern-looking human skulls.On December 1, 1899, Ernest Volk from the Peabody Museum of American Archaeologyand Ethnology at Harvard University, discovered a fossilised human femur and twoskull fragments in New Jersey. As these looked like they were from modernhumans, they were analysed by our good friend Aleš Hrdlička from the Smithsonianwho said “The antiquity of this specimen must rest on the geological evidencealone.” The layer it was discovered in was later dated by the New JerseyGeological Survey (1987) to be 107,000 years old - 7,000 years before modernhumans were said to have arisen in Africa.62 Further examples include ananatomically modern human skull that was discovered in Buenos Aires in 1896.This was inspected by Hrdlička who admitted it was found in “the upper-mostportion of the Pre-ensenadean stratum.” This would date it 1 million to 1.5million years old.63 Hrdlička also inspected an atlas bone (from the top of thespine) that was also found in Argentina lodged in a layer 3 - 5 million yearsold. He concluded that it could not be ancient because it was from a modernhuman, disregarding the geological layer it was found in. He felt it was onlyworthy of being “dropped of necessity into obscurity” (much like hisnon-scientific analysis of the giants of North America!)In 2002, scientists from Liverpool’s John Moores University and Oxford’sResearch Laboratory of Archaeology dated a skull discovered in Mexico to about13,000 years old. It was that of a 26 year old woman found in the suburbs ofMexico city that baffled the discoverers: “...it is long and narrow and typically Caucasian in appearance, like the headsof white, western Europeans today.” 64 As we have seen already, Peñon woman has been compared to the historic Pericúpeople of Baja California, who also shared similar physical traits to thePatagonians.65 Is the human family tree, most notably in North America, morecomplicated than once thought? “...it is probably no accident that some of our northeastern Indians haverepeatedly been described as European in appearance.” 66 Jeffrey Goodman Ph.D wrote the book American Genesis67 and speculated that Homosapiens sapiens actually speciated in the Americas and spread around the worldfrom there. He indicated that our species is much older than is generallysupposed, and outlines many of the accounts above. He even suggests migrationscould easily have gone the other way across the Bering land bridge and to otherparts of the world.cro-magnon-height-chart.bmp [../Images/image00553.jpeg]Cro-Magnon man in Europe suddenly appeared in the human timeline (around 45,000years ago), with developed stone tools that are remarkably similar to manydiscovered in the Americas, despite the fact that the ones in the Americas werefrom a much earlier date.Another intriguing aspect of his theory is the problem of Cro-Magnon-type skullsbeing discovered in America that date back to long before the emergence ofCro-Magnon man in Europe. These characteristics have also been noted in latergiant skeletal remains in North America. The use of the Cro-Magnon title isslowly being replaced by Archaic Homo Sapiens or something similar. This passagefrom Wikipedia summarises their impressive traits, although it fails to mentionthat they often exceeded seven feet in height: “They are thought to have stood on average 176.2 cm (5 feet 9 ⅓ inches) tall,though large males may have stood as tall as 195 cm (6 feet 5 inches) andtaller. They differ from modern-day humans in having a more robust physique anda slightly larger cranial capacity. The Cro-Magnons had long, fairly low skulls,with wide faces, prominent noses, and moderate to no prognathism. A distinctivetrait was the rectangular eye orbits.”68 After thirty years of general academic denial of Goodmans work, GermanDziebel—on his Anthropogenesis blog—has brought this theory back to life. Alongwith numerous other academics, he also hypothesises that humans originated inAmerica, and not in Africa, and has evidence to back it up: “While we don’t have a single ancient DNA sample to ascertain whether modernAfrican populations are directly related to ancient “anatomically modern humans”(e.g., Omo, Herto, etc.) and hominids in Africa, we do have ancient DNA data (Xchromosome, autosomes, blood groups) that document matches between Neanderthaland Denisovan genetic variation, on the one hand, and modern humans in the NewWorld.” 69 Skulls that look remarkably similar to modern human skulls do completely twistthe origins of Cro-Magnon man, as it was always thought he originated from theother side of the Atlantic Ocean. “After speciation in the New World had occurred, early Homo sapiens sapienscolonized first Eurasia and then Africa replacing and admixing with localhominids.” 70 But who were these people? In America: The New World or Old? (1990) WernerMuller suggests Cro-Magnon man left America and headed to Europe, a theory thatneatly fits into their mysterious appearance in the human timeline. He arguesthe Salish, the Sioux, the Algonquian, and a mysterious white-skinned, beardedpeople that once inhabited the northern tier of North America may have beenCro-Magnon. The white race were not too friendly towards the other groups somany of them migrated south to avoid the white antagonists, although Mullerhints that a climatic catastrophe may have caused this too. He states that thewhite-skinned people moved eastwards across the North Atlantic into what is nowScandinavia and western Europe.71 He dates this migration to around 44,000 yearsago—very close to the proposed time of the sudden emergence of Cro-Magnon man inEurope.Goodman argues that stone tools discovered in Spain and other parts of Europewere a style that was already fully developed in America dating back to 48,000years ago. Del Mar Man (San Diego) was carbon dated to around this time, and askull from Sunnyvale, California was dated to 70,000 years ago. Both looksurprisingly Cro-Magnon.72 “In the 1940s and 1950s, leading physical anthropologists such as Ernest Hootenof Harvard University, Carelton Coon of the University of Pennsylvania, and J.B. Birdsell of the University of California at Los Angeles broke withtraditional views, suggesting that the first Paleo-Indians were not Mongolianbut Caucasian.” 73 The term Caucasian does not just refer to white people. It includes populationsof Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Western Asia, Central Asia, andSouth Asia. The term was used in biological anthropology for many people fromthese regions, without regard necessarily to skin tone. 74 Megafauna and the Giants The megafauna on North America included mammoths, mastodons, sabre toothedtigers, sloths, beavers, short-faced bears, lions, horses, bison, giant condorsand other incredible beasts that thrived in America from from as far back as 2.5million years ago to around 11,000 years ago. At Big Bone Lick in Kentuckynumerous bones of mastodons “with tusks twelve feet long,” along with Clovispoints dated to around 10,000 years old were discovered.75An account of these finds from 1762 mentioned a tantalising legend of giants: “No such creatures as these had ever been seen alive by the Indians, but legendsaid that they had once been hunted through the forests by men of giganticstature and that when the last of these men had died, God had destroyed theirmighty prey in order to protect the present race of Indians.” 76 Although in this book we have described great battles between the Indians andthe giants, there may have also been a peaceful coexistence in archaic timeswhere the Tall Ones were not only seen as gods, but were also extremely helpfulto their shorter counterparts: “It is said the thunderbirds once came to earth in the form of giants. Thesegiants did wonderful things, such as digging the ditches where the rivers run.At last they died of old age, and their spirits went again to the clouds andthey resume their form as thunderbirds.” 77 The above legend may give some credence to many of the traditional stories andmyths describing the first humans descending from the Great Spirit into humanform.megafauna-of-north-america-EDIT.bmp [../Images/image00554.jpeg] Image above: Various Megafauna with human on bottom right. This next account was a favourite of Vine Deloria’s, who felt it was animportant part of extending the history of mankind into the deep past. Itrecounts a giant human trying to kill a giant beaver in the Pacific Northwest.It reads: “...there was a large man who chiseled for a large beaver. He worked in vain buthe could not kill it...He cut the mother open, took out the young ones, and putthem in the water...They say both the man and the beaver were giants.” 78 Vine Deloria Jr. collected numerous accounts of megafauna in relation to gianthumans that often ended with a “Higher Spirit” destroying the beasts, or atleast driving them away.79 “Giant men, quite often with white skin, are involved in about 20 percent of thebig-animal stories that I have located.”80 Deloria goes on to emphasize that the giant men died out just before, or at thesame time as the megafauna81 and that mammoths were herded like cattle by thegiants. This account comes from Mississippi: “There had likewise been a tribe of cannibals, who feasted on the bodies oftheir enemies. They...were giants, and utilized the mammoths as their burdenbearers. They kept them closely herded, and as they devoured everything andbroke down the forests, this was the origin of the prairies...this cannibal raceand the mammoth perished about the same time, by a great epidemic.” 82 Deloria emphasises that it was not due to malnutrition or disease, but becauseof changes in the atmosphere: “Watching this process of downsizing, Indians may have felt they were beingsaved by the Great Spirit....or they may have attributed the demise...to anepidemic.” 83 These discoveries listed above certainly paint a different picture of what wasgoing on in America during the late Pleistocene (and possibly post-Pleistocene). Many of these oral histories hint that the giants were from theearliest of times and that many of them died out in the time of the megafaunaextinction.Later in this chapter we will look carefully at the Younger Dryas impact of12,900 years ago, as it was this cataclysm that is thought to have wiped out themegafauna. This may have also caused the ice sheets to melt, leading to extremeflooding, darkened skies and other devastating phenomena that lasted for overone thousand years.84 Lost Energy Science of the Mound Builders Numerous scientific discoveries in the last decade suggest the Native Americangiants were highly advanced in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, agriculture,and it has been recorded up to relatively recent times that they were adepts ofhigh magic and shamanic practice as evidenced in the knowledge of their Manitouprinciples. Stories suggest they could even control the weather and influencefertility and the growth of crops.85 It has been long debated these are merelyfolk tales and not based in reality. However, there are numerous storiescollected by Vine Deloria that describe medicine men who could make corn growbefore one’s very eyes. These include stories from the Navajo, Zuni and Pueblopeoples. An interesting example is titled The Pawnee Corn Growers that waswitnessed by a certain Major North and other white people in historic times: “...a few kernels of the corn were buried in the loose earth...the soil was seento move, and a tiny green blade came slowly into view. This continued toincrease in height and size, until in the course of twenty minutes or half anhour from the time of planting, the stalk of corn was a foot or fifteen inchesin height....at this point Major North was obliged to leave the lodge, to takeout a white woman who was fainting...” 86 From The Andersen Intelligencer, July 16, 1903, it was reported that corn wasfound in a Kentucky mound sealed in a jar. It was said to be buried 60 feetbelow the ground alongside a giant skeleton measuring 8 ft 6 in. It was plantedand produced a good yield which was then distributed to other farmers by thefinder.grew-in-spite-of-age-The%20Daily%20Star%20-%20Jun%208%2c%201900.bmp[../Images/image00555.jpeg] This is one report that speaks of an enormous skeleton being buried with cornthat, when planted, was a very good yielder. Could this account be part of agreater story pointing to a lost ancient technique to imbue crops with thesespecial characteristics?Authors of Seed of Knowledge, Stone of Plenty (2005) John Burke and Kaj Halbergwere for a long time intrigued by accounts of fertility and natural magnetismassociated with the mounds of North America. During the 1990s they decided toinvestigate the secret energies hidden within ancient sacred sites usinghigh-tech modern equipment to see if the earthworks and megalithic sites couldsomehow affect the fertility of seeds and grains. Their dedication to unravelingthe truth paid off when they realised the mounds they tested charged-up seedsand grains to such a degree that the crops would have increases in yield, bemore fertile, be frost and disease resistant, but most importantly to ourresearch, be larger.87They found that this exact same ‘energy’ also affects consciousness and can putone into an altered state, often at these megalithic or earthwork sites (and atvision quest locations). Extensive tests were carried out and their conclusionsshould have shaken the scientific world, but were quietly ignored by themainstream and put on the shelf as ‘fringe science.’ However, it revealed theancients had a secret energy science fully developed and possibly used forthousands of years previously. The mounds and megaliths may have had a veryuseful purpose—they were not just ceremonial, but designed to guarantee anabundant harvest in an age when crop failure was very common.Further tests were also carried out by geobiologist Alanna Moore on her farm inAustralia. She laid out multiple mini-stone circles and got amazing results.88The natural magnetic telluric currents organised themselves and created a forcefield that increased the health and vitality of her crops, again with increasedsize.Could this work on a macrocosmic level where multiple sites spread out across anentire county would create what John Michell called ‘The Enchantment of theLandscape’—a force field of higher consciousness and positive energy, that gaveabundant health to all the crops, plants, animals and humans within it? Is ittoo much to consider that the ancient Mound Builders perhaps believed that whatwas increasing their crops in size, may have increased their own size? Electromagnetic Energies and Giantism In a scientific paper published by Tsutomu Nishimura, Kaneo Mohri, and MasanoriFukushima of the Translational Research Center, at Kyoto University, theypronounced that “...exposure to an extremely low frequency electromagnetic field(ELF-EMF) was associated with an increase in animal body weight.” They alsosuggested bones may increase in size over time: “It is also possible that EMFs exert an effect on skeleton size via alterationof the proliferation and activity of bone cells. In support of this hypothesis,pulsed EMF stimulation has been used clinically for more than twenty-five yearsfor the treatment of patients with delayed fracture healing and non-unions.Furthermore, a substantial number of in vitro studies have shown that EMFs havepositive effects on the proliferation and activity of bone cells.” 89 Their most recent tests put forward the theory that “the large body size of thedinosaurs was caused by ELF-EMFs generated by natural phenomena: geomagneticstorms, volcanic activity, earthquakes, or Schumann resonance.” With so manyNative American legends speaking of major cataclysms deep in prehistory, andevents such as the Younger Dryas Impact, this data may also prove useful inunderstanding how natural phenomena affects the size of human and animal life.Furthermore, the latitude of where the animals were living also had a directeffect on body size. The geomagnetic field of the earth is almost twice asstrong at higher latitudes (nearer the North Pole), as compared to those atlower latitudes (nearer the Equator). Their research focused on, “...the relationship between magnetic field (MF) exposure and animal body sizebecause Bergmann’s rule holds that organisms tend to be larger at higherlatitudes.” 90 Bergmann’s rule is an ecogeographic principle that generally states thatpopulations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, andspecies of smaller size are found in warmer regions. The areas of latitude wherethe Patagonian and Onas giants once existed—at the southern tip of SouthAmerica, and far north in the Canadian Lakes region, where there were humans whowere growing one inch every thousand years—are two examples of where theBergmann Rule may have been functioning. Being a giant may have been normal atextreme high and low latitudes. “Our hypothesis is that, these changes in geomagnetic fields might causeorganisms to grow in size.... These animals would gain a considerable amount ofbody size over generations, if their surrounding environmental MF and/or EMFbecome stronger.” They also demonstrated that DNA may also be affected: “...100 mT static magnetic fields have an effect on mitochondria; they foundthat energy activity and cell respiration in mitochondria that were exposed to aMF [magnetic field] increased by factors of 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, comparedwith the sham control group. It seems that mitochondria are activated by MF andthereafter provide more ATP [Adenosine triphosphate transports chemical energywithin cells for metabolism] to some organelles in the cells of an organism.Promotion of ATP synthesis by a MF would provide the energy to maintain a largerbody size. That is, organisms would be able to use magnetic energy as well asother forms of physical energy.” 91 Could this have somehow been known by the ancient shamans? Were moundsdeliberately designed and constructed to replicate or enhance these energies—andeven create an artificial ‘growth’ environment for the elite to live within?This positive effect on the body and bones may also have had an effect onconsciousness (as outlined by Burke and Halberg), so these fluctuations in theEarth’s natural magnetic field could have been seen as having a spiritualeffect, and places of natural magnetism could have become the locations wherethese mounds were built.The elite, however, may have lost some of this knowledge over time and althoughthe mounds still functioned as energy generators—even up to the present day—newfarming techniques, religious practices, and an already large population were onthe increase. “Cultivating the ennobling principle of what is termed Orenda, Native Americanmedicine traditions assert that the men of old were far more robust andtireless. As late as just 5 or 6,000 years ago, a world tradition of very talland strong people was alive and well, yet all gone now. Stories relating of suchpeople permeate the Americas, a situation where they seem to have survivedlonger. Gradually losing the remarkably potent power associated with the Orendaprinciple, these people mainly came to a tragic end while the smaller-in-staturepeople, to whom they were directly related, were growing in number. The oldorder was gradually supplanted, succumbing to absorption or extermination. Goingback before five and six thousand years however, and by the sparse or inferredevidence, the world was populated differently. Clans of very tall, physicallyrobust, and otherwise gifted people had the rule.” 92 There may have been numerous external factors that stimulate growth in humans.However, the one factor that is often overlooked is the effect of carbon dioxideon life on Earth. Today we see the increase of CO2 as a sign of impending doom,but in prehistoric America, scientists have speculated this may have been themissing component in understanding the increased size of megafauna, and quitepossibly the mega-humans that we have been discussing.In A Comprehensive Theory on Aging, Giantism and Longevity (1979), Donald Pattenraises several essential questions about why the megafauna (and the coexistinggiant humans) decreased in size so rapidly. He noted that gigantism occuredacross a great many species and the decrease happened quickly “because of aradical change in environmental conditions.”93Patten also linked giantism with longevity, suggesting these phenomena occuredtogether. He points to the incredible ages of some of the patriarchs in theBible and how difficult it is for us to believe they could have lived so long,as we are confined to a much shorter lifespan. Vine Deloria Jr. was told manytimes by Indian elders that their ancestors lived in excess of 200 years.94Patten concluded that in pre-flood times there was more carbon dioxide in theatmosphere and this would have stimulated growth increases in a majority ofliving things. Modern tests have confirmed that elevated carbon dioxide levelsincrease plant growth. An excess of it in the atmosphere has been known totrigger the hypothalamus gland and hormones that affect growth in humans.95 Itwould also stimulate cerebral circulation and oxygenation. We never stop tothink what life would have been like in deep prehistory, with something assimple as an extra ½ percent of carbon dioxide making us live longer, be biggerand stronger, and have quite possibly enhancing other powers within us. The Younger Dryas Impact At the time known in Native tradition as the ‘Dark Tent’, all megafauna becameextinct or decreased rapidly in size over a few generations. In one way, thesurviving Indians saw this as a gift from Great Spirit and it inspired them tokeep it in their stories and pass it down through multiple generations to affordus today a version of what really happened in ancient America. The variousdescriptions of countrywide flooding, extreme cooling, wildfires and earthquakesare not mere fantasies. They were real stories describing the onslaught of theYounger Dryas impact that saw multiple comets hit the northern ice sheet andparts of North America that caused massive devastation across the entirety ofthe country, with the effect reaching the whole planet, as described in hundredsof worldwide myths, including Noah’s flood.The general Younger Dryas impact hypothesis states that about 12,900 years ago,air bursts or impacts from a comet set areas of the North American continent onfire, melted the ice sheets, and disrupted climate. It is also said to havecaused a Quarternary extinction event in North America that resulted in theextinction of most of the megafauna, and the rapid demise of the Clovis culturewho were present in America at the time. The Younger Dryas ice age lasted forabout 1,200 years before the weather got back to normal and temperaturesincreased. These events are also seen as part of the Holocene extinctionphenomenon.The Antediluvian world (before the flood) may have also been a golden age whereall life was enhanced by this slight increase in CO2. Large, healthy humans wholived to a great age, robust animal life with plants, vegetable and fruits, thatgrew abundantly in a temperate climate were the norm.96 After 1,200 years ofcold weather, dark skies and food shortages that all followed the flood, theimprovement in the climate triggered an ancient worldwide civilizing effort.Within 200 years of the end of the Younger Dryas, a stable way of life emerged,focussing on megalithic and mound construction, agriculture, and a reverence forthe Earth and fertility. The golden age had returned, but this time, they knewit may not last.As humans and animals decreased in size after the great cataclysm, the fewremaining giants may have become revered as gods or sages. This may havetriggered the elite to protect signs of royalty and to selectively breed. Sincethe Younger Dryas had caused so much death and destruction, these giants wholived longer, and who were more physically powerful, became the natural rulers,shamans and leaders of isolated surviving tribes. Over time, their genetictraits became stronger due to selective breeding, and stories of the Tall Onesbefore the great cataclysm became the stuff of legend.Whoever these exceptionally tall people were, they very likely invented a secretenergy science to increase fertility in crops, but to also maintain and enhancetheir royal traits, as well as develop other techniques for health and longevitythat were essential for survival after the cataclysm.The warriors and chieftains were always the tallest tribal members, and theprolonged wars and skirmishes may have been part of the reason the Tall Onesdied off and the gene pool became weak in more recent times. This may haveslowly decreased the height of the general populace, but did not affecteveryone, and with the later migrations from other parts of the world, the giantgenes lived on.One of the last giant warriors in historical times was Kots-a-to-ah or SmokedShield, who is shown in this painting by George Catlin on the Red River of Texasc.1830: “Another of the extraordinary men of this tribe, nearly seven feet in stature,and distinguished, not only as one of the greatest warriors, but swiftest onfoot, in the (Kiowa) nation. This man, it is said, runs down a buffalo on foot,and slays it with his knife or his lance, as he runs by his side!” 97 Image: “Kots-a-to-ah” or Smoked Shield stood at nearly 7 ft. By George Catlin,c.1830.Smoked-Shield-7ft.bmp [../Images/image00556.jpeg] Using anthropometric data originally collected by Franz Boas in the mid-1800s,it was found that the Plains nomads were tallest people in the world during themid-nineteenth century,98 suggesting it took some tribes much longer to losethese traits. There are very few instances of acromegaly, or pituitary inducedgigantism throughout the known history of America. They were simply gigantic,healthy humans: “Indians, generally, are about the size of white people. The Osages, and someother tribes, who are of remarkable height, and fine figure, are exceptions tothis remark. In these respects they exceed any equally large body of white [sic]known among us. In the shape of their limbs, and their erect form, Indians haveevidently the advantage over the whites. Some, whom I have seen, would beperfect models for the sculptor. Instances of deformity are rare.” 99 The fact that the giants existed from as far back as 9,000 years ago—withlegends placing them deep into pre-flood times—puts the whole story into atimeline that is starting to be pieced together. Although these very earlyinhabitants were probably not building mounds, there is one example dated to astaggering 22,000 years ago in California’s Imperial Valley, where “Yuha Man”was excavated.100 It was 9 feet by 12 feet wide and, if dated correctly, may bea clue to the true origins of the later Mound Builders.Who the giants were and where they came from, as well as how they got so big isstill not fully agreed upon, but the evidence for extremely early humans in theAmericas poses an intriguing possibility that the giants may well haveoriginated in this land mass and survived (in some tribes) up until the early1900s.As we have hypothesized in this chapter, the effects of the Bergmann Rule, alongwith heightened CO2 levels may have been partly responsible for the genesis ofthe North American giants. Moreover, there is genetic evidence that theDenisovan genes made their way over to North America as early as 20,000 BC.Around 15,000 years ago the Solutreans arrived from Western Europe. Theinfluence of the California Channel Islanders probably came inland at varioustimes between 11,000 and 1,000 BC. The cave dwellers of Humbolt Lake in Nevadawere terrorising the local Indians from as early as 8,000 BC, the same time thesimilarly red-haired bog mummies were alive and kicking in Florida. From thesouth around 6,000 BC, the Pericúes migrated north into the Southwestern statesof America. Canadian giants—who couldn’t stop growing—moved slowly south fromthe Great Lakes into the Ohio Valley around 5,000 BC, may have been the originalAllegheni. Further waves of settlers from Northern Europe may well have arrivedfrom the east, and the biblical Nephilim would have arrived around 1300 - 1500BC.It seems North America was inundated with immigrants, who all just happened tobe of the tall persuasion, some no doubt had unusual teeth, as well asincredibly powerful jaws, and bone structure—bringing their own unique geneticmarkers into North America. For some reason, giants from all over the world weremagnestised to ancient America. In 1150 AD, Geoffrey of Monmouth tantalisinglywrote what might be a very early mention of Turtle Island, the ancientindigenous name of North America: “Beyond the realms of Gaul, beneath the sunset Lieth an island, girt about byocean, Guarded by ocean—erst the haunt of giants.” 101 We have included evidence that America may have been the origin point of theTall Ones, based on archaeological data and tribal folklore and it may be thatthese other exotic interlopers were simply latecomers to an already establishedculture of giants, some of whom may have simply been returning to their homelandafter earlier migrations out of America.This final chapter took us on a journey through some interesting (and quitebizarre) theories, so we hope we have given some ideas for further research, asthe mystery of the ancient giants of America is still in its infancy, and withincreasing carbon dioxide emissions, human hybridization, and a newunderstanding of earth energies in our current society, perhaps gigantism mightbe coming back, whether we like it or not. The time of the Tall Ones may be uponus once more.gil-zamora.bmp [../Images/image00557.jpeg] Image: Reconstruction of a (non-Adena) generalized 8 ft giant by forensic artistGil Zamora.

Wealso urge Native Americans to get involved, as we feel this is an importantstudy in understanding our true origins, from legends, elders and oral historiesof the past.We also encourage readers to check these accounts out for yourself and look formore examples that are yet to be discovered, because they can trigger ancestralmemories of a reality that these giants were once inhabiting areas that becamethe cities and landscapes we currently live in.1-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00558.jpeg]2-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00559.jpeg]3-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00560.jpeg]4-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00561.jpeg]5-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00562.jpeg]6-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00563.jpeg]7-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00564.jpeg]8-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00565.jpeg]9-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00566.jpeg]10-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00567.jpeg]11-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00568.jpeg]12-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00569.jpeg]13-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00570.jpeg]14-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00571.jpeg]15-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00572.jpeg]16-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00573.jpeg]17-gaz.tiff [../Images/image00574.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Notes & References Foreword by Ross Hamilton1.
