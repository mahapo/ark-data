It is echoed and re-echoed by critic and reader upon its publication. It certainly ap pears to be a fair question whenever, the subjects seem so much out of the route of ordinary in formation, as the present volume. The scattered records of the Past, within the historical period, would apparently yield scarcely enough material to make a short magazine article of any interest, to say nothing of swelling in size, to the dignity of a book. It is now conceded, however, by our wisest scientists, that every configuration and corres ponding circumstance points to the possibility of the existence of an island continent in the neigh borhood, if not directly over the great West In dian Archipelago, just as the whole configuration of the North American Continent tells the story of the inland sea that broke through its barriers at the Thousand Islands in the St. Lawrence river, and hurling itself over Niagara Falls, left"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 OUR STORY the habitable valley of the Mississippi, as a legacy to man for future settlement. The sacred writings of all nations concur in the same declaration and statement of disaster to some portion of the earth, most generally including all. In a late issue of Mind, appears an article headed: &quot;A Monument to Atlantis,&quot; which says : &quot;A notable discovery of more than ordinary interest for historians, especially those who have a leaning toward antiquities, has lately been made by the well-known archaeologist, Augustus Le Plongeon. This discovery should particularly at tract the attention of Americans, since it enables them to lay claim to one of the most important monuments of ancient times. The edifice in ques tion is the Pyramid of Xochicalo, standing 5,396 feet above the level of the sea, and situated to the south-southwest of Cuernavaca, 60 miles from the City of Mexico. For more than a century the pyramid has been occasionally visited by distin guished travelers, including the learned Hum-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 5 boldt; but none succeeded in discovering the pur pose for which the monument had been erected, nor in deciphering the mysterious inscriptions on its sides. As far back as 1886, Dr. Le Plongeon pub lished his alphabetic key to the Maya hieroglyphs, comparing this with the ancient Egyptian hieratic alphabet. He has now found that the signs on the Pyramid of Xochicalo are both Maya and Egyptian ; and a careful study of these decorative inscriptions has made it plain to him that the pyramid was a monumental structure erected to commemorate the submergence and destruction of the great Land of Mu (Plato s Atlantis), to gether with its population of 64,000,000 of hu man beings, about 11,500 years ago. Dr. Le Plongeon, in his remarkable work, &quot;Queen Moo and the Egyptian Sphinx,&quot; gives four Maya accounts of the same cataclysm.

These records, on stone, on sun-dried bricks, on papyrus, all tell the same story. The little we know of the Aztecs is also confirmatory of the same fact. Whence came the people of South America, with their advanced civilization and traditions of the Past? What mighty people built the great cities and temples of the now forest- covered cities of Yucatain and Central America, with their carved glyphs, and correspondencies to the hieroglyphs of the Valley of the Nile and the East Indian entablatures; and moreover, on al most precisely similar styles of architecture to those of Egypt and India.

The idea is the same the de parted ghost was to be saved the trouble of mak ing a new body, perhaps at short notice, at the great day of the resurrection. The trinity in unity of God, now universally received, was an Egyptian idea, and the same is wrought into the stone tablets which La Plon- geon and his amiable wife have unearthed in the forests of the Maias and Quiches. If the nation, of which these are but the feeble remnants, had not disappeared by some cataclysmal climax we must certainly have had some later, historical data. As the mind of the present generation is more largely than ever, de sirous of Truth, the idea of Astral presentation and perception may not be without its weight, especially as the books of Wisdom of the Past declare, that automatic books of record are kept of all deeds and manifestation, upon the earth.

Those who are coming back into the present civilization, if they were of the advanced and cultured classes of Atlantis and the most ancient Egypt, would find more advantages of acquirement, through our leisure and experience, than when hurled into life amid the horrors and darkness of the Stone Age.

I do not doubt, that to many readers, will come fleeting glimpses of these scenes, as if they had been part of them. It is a conceded fact, there have never been, since the fall of Atlantis, so many re-incarnated Atlantians upon the earth at the same time, as now. This accounts for the almost universal demand out of the Astral records for the forgotten knowledge of the occult, which they there recorded. This also explains the readi ness of the public mind to receive knowledge of the doctrines of Mental Healing, Spiritualism, Theosophy, and occultism in all its branches. Ignatius Donnelly finds a supporter of his .Atlantis theory in Sir Daniel Wilson, president of the University of Toronto, who declares after a great deal of search, that the lost Atlantis was"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"io OUR STORY not a myth, but that it was really a part of the continent of America. He accounts for its dis appearance from view in a different way, but that is merely incidental. Donnelly s theory was that the land was sub merged by some great volcanic upheaval, and that from those who escaped to the continents of Europe and Asia came the tradition of the deluge. Sir Daniel rejects this explanation as being dis proved by the fact that there are no traces of such volcanic action either on the continent or in the ocean bed. He believes that the ancient Egyp tians, the most progressive and adventurous people of ancient times, discovered the continent, but that in the decline both of their learning and power, it became lost to view and existed at the time our knowledge of Egypt begins merely as a shadowy tradition. It is his opinion that traces of the Egyptians of those days are to be sought in the ruined cities of Central America, whose origin has never been"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. n determined nor even been made the basis of any reasonable theory. Such a discovery would furnish a substantial basis for the legend of tHe lost Atlantis and the theory invests those won derful ruins with a new interest for the an tiquarians. The St. Louis Republic said: &quot;Atlantis was a continent supposed to have existed at a very early period in the Atlantic Ocean, over against the Pillars of Hercules,&quot; but which was subse quently sunk in a cataclysm of which history gives no record. Plato is the first who gives an account of it, and he is said to have obtained his information from some Egyptian priests with whom he had come in contact. Plato s account says: &quot;Atlantis was a continent larger than Asia and Africa put together, and that at its west ern extremity were islands which afforded easy passage to a large continent lying still beyond this last mentioned continent being now supposed to be South America.&quot; Nine thousand years be-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 OUR STORY . fore the time of Plato, according to the tradition, Atlantis was a powerful, thickly settled-county which extended its way over Africa and the major portion of what is now Europe, &quot;even to as far as the Tyrrhenian Sea.&quot; Further progress of the invasion of the Atl an tides was checked by the combined efforts of the Athenians and other Greeks. Shortly after the invaders were driven from the continents of Europe and Africa a great earthquake shook Atlantis from center to cir cumference. First, the outlying islands sank; then great areas of the mainland. Waves ran mountain high across hundreds of square miles of what had the day before been fertile fields. Great temples were racked and riven, and the affrighted populace climbed upon the ruins to escape the encroaching waters. On the second day, after a night of terrors which no pen could possibly describe, the earthquake shocks were of greatly increased violence, ending only after the entire continent had been engulfed. There is no"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 13 page in history or tradition that records a more frightful catastrophe, and nothing would be of more absorbing interest than a work entirely de voted to giving an account of what is known con cerning it. To the objector who urges that the explorers of the world have never discovered any traces of the great city and continent, whose story I have endeavored to give in the following pages; per mit me to give a few straws floating on our sea of current literature, \\vhich show that the his tory of past ages may yet be read in the Central part of our continent: &quot;The recent report that a citizen of the United States has discovered among the mountains of the Mexican State of Sinaloa a long-forgotten city tallies with a curious local tradition of the region. Adjoining the State of Sinaloa on the south is the State of Jallisco, and of this State, Guadala jara is the capital. Living in the mountains of Jallisco, part of the great Sierra Madre or"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 OUR STORY &quot;Mother Range&quot; that extends through Sinaloa and thence northward, are the unconquered Yaquis, a brown-haired people with light eyes and almost fair complexions. Guadalajara is the only civilized town that these Yaquis visit, and it has long been believed there that the Yaquis fastnesses of the Sierra Madre range conceal not only rich mines of silver, but as well the lost city of the Aztec race. No one has hitherto pierced the mountain wilderness, because the naked Yaquis have an effective system of passive resist ance that has hitherto successfully closed the sole line of approach. The only human beings other than the Yaquis themselves admitted to the moun tains of Jallisco are a few renegade Apaches, mur derous wretches, vastly more dangerous to would- be explorers than the peaceful but persistent Yaquis.&quot; There is no question in the minds of those who have given attention to the subject, that the Aztecs are the lineal descendants of the mighty"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 15 nation who sought to know beyond the law governing the created. Of the unknown city above mentioned, we add another description from a different source: &quot;During the frequent visits I have made to Mexico,&quot; said a mining engineer of Philadelphia to an Inquirer reporter, &quot;I have come in con tact with many of the Indians resident there and have heard some very singular stories. One which all the Indians unite in telling, is that far in the interior exists an enormous city, never yet visited by white men. It is described as peopled by a race similar to the ancient Aztecs, who are sun worshipers and offer human sacrifices to their deity. &quot;The race is said to be in a high state of civilization, and the Indians say that the city is full of huge structures which are miracles of quaint but beautiful architecture, and are situated on broad paved streets, far surpassing those of the City of Mexico."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 OUR STORY &quot;One Indian, I recollect, assured me that he had seen the city and its inhabitants with his own eyes, but had been afraid of being captured and had fled. Of course, I did not believe him, but, all the same, it is not a little strange that the accounts of the Mexican Indians, relative to the mysterious and magnificent, interior city agree perfectly.&quot; These are but of many of the allusions and tra ditions pointing to the fact, that somewhere in the Southwest, there is a people who undoubtedly hold a complete historical record of the chain of events from Atlantis in its prime, down to the present day. While there is perhaps but a single city inhabited and secluded from the outside world of to-day as keepers of the Ancient Wis dom, we yet find ruins of such magnitude as to impress us more strongly with the idea that the people who builded the original structures, could not have w r holly disappeared from this Conti nent. The following from San Diego, Cal., we"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 17 offer in proof, calling attention to the fact that the dragon is a favorite design in the East Indian sculptures : &quot;The ruins of a prehistoric city have just been discovered by a party of prospectors from Yurna when on the Colorado desert in search of the Pegleg mine. The wind had laid bare the walls and the remains of the stone buildings a distance of 420 feet in length by 260 feet in width. Gigantic pillars, quaintly carved to represent dragons heads and rattlesnakes, still stood in the sands of the desert, supporting on their tops huge slabs of granite weighing many tons. The frieze ornamentation resembled Egyptian sculp tures and exhibited a greater degree of skill than is possessed by the Indian artisans of the present day. Fragments of pottery were found underneath the debris, and together with the crumbled piece of frieze were brought by one of the party, to this city. One of his associates came to San Diego and the others returned to Yuma, nearly"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"i8 OUR STORY two weeks ago. But the story of their discovery was carefully guarded, in the hope that in some way they might profit by it. &quot;The discoverers, in company with four others, afterwards went to the desert to explore the ruins. They were driven back by a sand storm, reaching this city to-day, but will make a careful exam ination of the ruins in the season when the con ditions are favorable for extensive explorations. From the relics exhibited it is evident that an important archeaeological discovery has been made.&quot; In connection with the above, there is a pecu liarity to be noticed in the occurrence of the sand storm. It has always been so. A storm or some sudden natural event has warded off all ef forts to reach these wonderful remains of the prehistoric, or even the existing cities. When men shall be ready to seek them, desiring knowl edge and not treasure, there is no doubt the keys for the unlocking of the mysteries of the Past,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 19 will be given into worthy hands and what we have herein written will receive ample corrobor- ation. We add still another account of wonder ful discovery in proof of the immense popula tion of the old Atlantian kingdom in its prime. This time, it is from the City of Mexico, the center of the modern Atlantian or Aztec civiliza tion: &quot;What appears to be the verification of an old Aztec fable of a buried race of cave-dwellers and a hidden city in southwestern Mexico is a matter in which the local scientists are interested at present. L. P. Leroyal, a French engineer, who has lived long in this republic, has just arrived form the wilds of the Southwest and reported that he has discovered in the State of Guerrero a huge natural cave, which he believes to be the greatest in Mexico, if not in the world. He says it is much larger than the famous cavern of Caca- huamilpa, situated some distance south of Guer- navaca, which has hitherto been supposed to be"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 OUR STORY the largest natural cave in existence in Mexico. Mr. Leroyal, after penetrating a considerable dis tance into the cave, determined to make a thor ough investigation of it, and accordingly a few days ago furnished himself with food sufficient for a day, provided himself with lanterns, etc., and set out upon his task all alone. As he went along he made a thorough plan of the cave, but did not anticipate that his task would be so arduous as it proved. At the first, the bottom of the cave was a gradual slope downward, then changed upward and afterward alternated for the most part between descents and ascents. Here and there, how r ever, a level bottom of great width was met. The height of the cave varied, as might naturally be expected; in some places it was several hundred feet high. For some distance from the entrance no trace of human beings was found. Occasionally magnificent stalactites and stalagmites, the finest Mr. Leroyal had ever seen, were met with."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 21 &quot;After proceeding for some hours he came upon what had evidently been an ancient cemetery, as there were at least 400 petrified bodies, together with ancient idols, etc. There was also a foun tain of beautiful clear spring water which was found to be excellent. Some of the tools, as well as two or three skulls, Mr. Leroyal brought away with him, and they are now in this city. The appearance of this charnel house thus lighted up for the first time for hundreds of years was grew- some in the extreme and well calculated to shake the nerves of the explorer. Mr. Leroyal con tinued his explorations while hour after hour passed. It was not until after he had traveled a distance of at least twenty-one and one-half leagues that he thought it time to call a halt and proceed on his return journey. So far as he could see the distance still to be traversed might be very considerable, with the chances for the cave opening out, as the floor seemed to be well trodden by human feet. Fie retraced his steps as speedily"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 OUR STORY as possible, and after being underground for up ward of twenty-four hours, found himself once more at the entrance of the cave. Mr. Leroyal promised to make further explorations before long. It is expected that a party fully equipped for the exploration of this wonderful cavern of the dead, will soon be fitted out under the guid ance of the discoverer, and the outcome of the investigations will be awaited with interest. The natives of the locality, as, in fact, the Indian population in general, in Mexico, believe that at some place near the southwestern coast of Mexico there exists a great white city with countless treasure which has never been seen by white men, and the approach to which is so intricate and cleverly concealed that a stranger has never en tered its solitary precincts.&quot; With all the increasing mass of information on the subject, it seems there should be some effort at collection under guidance, of what is known about Atlantis the Mighty. To make a beginning"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 23 and thus call attention in this direction is my answer to the question: &quot;Why this book is written.&quot; ATLANTIAN MEMORIES. Out of the dim Past, old memories come to me; From where the light in all its glory seemed to be, As the people worshiped near the Sun s resplendent rays And lotus-crowned hailed with joy the festal days. Golden lyres, sending forth rich, harmonious strains Sounding the key-note, which o er the world still reigned. High above all, the Vestal s song enchanting soars, Mingling with the ripples on the wave-washed shores. From the Temple floats the bell s melodious chimes, So deep and mellow in that old Atlantian time."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 OUR STORY Throughout the Ages, linger these old memories still And hover round me with no effort of my will. Still in my heart is throbbing with the rythm of the waves, Those slumbering waves which, alas, became our graves. Again, I hear the glad hozannas to the Sun arise. Isis in the sanctuary, is veiled from human eyes, Which read no warning in the skies celestial hue ; Nor heard it murmured in the Ocean calm and blue ; Neither listened to the whispering wind so free, Telling of the doom, fair Atlantis was to see. I am thankful that the gates of memory ope, That great Angels weave the scattered threads of hope And clothe us freshly with its robes of snowy white ; While on our altar shines again the mystic light, The radiant star, which once o er Egypt shone. Glimmers once again, with a message all its own. Humble tho the Temple, the melody is there, The bell s sweet chiming breaks upon the silent air, Amid the incense rising from our sacred Shrine, Old Atlantian glories round our spirits twine."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. THERE is yet a little more of the flotsam and jetsam upon the stormy waves of human unfoldment which is supple mental to our opening chapter, and must be de tailed now or put entirely to one side. From two distinct sources, we give an account of an old Mexican city that has never been entered by the foot of a white man and which was known to be in existence long before the Spanish Conquest : &quot;Mr. Juan Alvarez, who has just returned from an exploring expedition in the southwestern part of the republic, reports that he has found a city which has never been entered by a white man, and which has evidently been in existence for hundreds of years, going back before the time of the conquest of the country by the Spaniards. It is an old Aztec city, and the approaches to it"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 OUR STORY are so guarded by nature that it is an impossibility to reach it if the inhabitants do not want a trav eler to get in. The city lies in the almost inaccessible moun tains in the extreme southwestern part of the country and is so far away from civilization that few white men have ever been in the neighbor hood. It was by the purest accident that Alvarez became aware that a city was anywhere in the vicinity, and after he found it, all of his endeavors tc reach it were unavailing on account of the persistent opposition of the natives. He had been traveling over the mountains in search of an outlet to the Pacific Ocean when he came to the top of an elevated plateau and crossed to the further edge. He had a magnificent view, and while looking over the country, saw what he took to be houses in a far distant valley. A close inspection with a glass convinced him that what he saw was really a collection of houses, and he at once set about reaching the place to see who"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 27 lived in that part of the country. After days of hard work climbing over cliffs and mountains, he reached a point from which he obtained a good view of the city and saw that it was regularly laid out in streets and was peo pled with a race w r ho knew something about civilization. The houses were of stone and were surrounded by yards, in which were growing flowers and shrubs. On all sides were evidences of taste shown by the inhabitants, and it was evi dent that he had found a city which was not known to the outside w r orld. &quot;A careful examination of the country showed him that the city was located within a natural amphitheater and was accessible from one side only. He saw that the only means of access was through a long and narrow defile which led into the mountains from the Pacific coast side, and he started to reach the place, where he could find this entrance. He made an outline drawing of the city as it appeared to him from the distant"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 OUR STORY mountain top, and this is all he has to show that there is a city within the heart of the mountains, for he was never allowed to reach the spot. &quot;From this drawing it is plain that the city has not less than four thousand inhibitants. The houses are all of stone and are supplied with doors and windows. In the center was a large building, which was undoubtedly the temple of worship, for on its walls could be seen sculptured designs representing the Deity. It was in the shape of the ancient teocalli, which are to be found in many parts of this country, and the people could be seen passing in and out of it during all hours of the day. &quot;After ten days arduous work Alvarez found himself at the foot of the mountains on the western slope, and set about searching for the canyon leading to the city. He had so well marked the lay of the land that he had no diffi culty in finding the entrance, but he was met by a band of Indians who refused to let him proceed."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 29 They offered him no violence, but insisted that he should return. He told them that he had come over the mountains and did not know how to find his way back. &quot;After a consultation, he was told he would have to remain awhile as a prisoner, and two runners were sent into the mountains, who re turned in a day with orders from some one in authority, and Alvarez was blindfolded and placed on the back of a mule. He traveled in this condition for three days, only having the bandage removed from his eyes at night. On the fourth day, he was told to remove his bandage, and when he did so, he found himself on the borders of the Pacific Ocean. The Indians had gone, leaving him with nothing to guide him back to the place where he had seen the city.&quot; This city is described in full in &quot;Future Rulers of America,&quot; and has been visited by persons in the body, who have been permitted so to do. We conclude our extracts with the description"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 OUR STORY of another mighty city, the work of the powerful nation whose capital, located on the great island of Atlantis, exercised its power both East and West, of which we are trying to tell: &quot;The American archaeologists who went to the recently discovered city in the Sierra Madre Mountains have returned, and tell of another hidden city five Spanish leagues north of the first city. The leader of the party, C. W. Pantion, of Philadelphia, says that these cities were evi dently twin capitals of a wealthy district long before the Aztecs appeared. The two cities are connected by underground passages hewn out of solid rock, and it was while exploring one of these passages that the second was discovered. It lies in a deep basin of the mountains, with no exit except the underground tunnel. At least none has been found. To that which we have thus drawn from all accessible sources in the visible, I now desire to add supplementary testimony from the Astral"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 31 Records, which I believe to be reliable and worthy of credence. Does not this collated evidence of the similarity in nature and civilization west of the great city, which could not possibly have had commerce with the mother-country for centuries, prove conclu sively, even to the realistic and scientific mind, a common origin for religious teachings, customs, languages, both oral and written?

In the days of the last Egyptian splendor, when it was the school to which the Greeks and Romans resorted for instruction, was the last time noted in history of such a re-appearance in sufficient numbers to admit of a national control.

As soon as the Anglo-Saxon speaking races were sufficiently developed out of savagery, the Atlantians, commenced re-appearing, startling the whole world ever and anon, with their great strides toward wisdom and knowledge, as they slowly paved the way by conquest and discovery, for the settlement and re-occupation of that which belonged to them; and for the utilization of all their old resources, under new conditions of added strength and experience.

When Atlantis was in its prime, there were other units in the world s category of nations which were not so far advanced. If Atlantis had held on in the even tenor of her way, all other nations of the world would have received the light, and been uplifted to something near its own stand point, but when this chance of development was cut off, they groped in comparative darkness. When this class of people incarnated again in force of numbers, such scenes as the conquest of Rome by the Goths and Vandals ; the overrunning of Europe by the Huns, and the eruption of the Tartars, times without number, occurred. As they disappeared from the mortal vision, we can but recognize their sameness of purpose, and the most pertinent fact that undone duty made all this trouble for the Atlantians of the Far Past, their comrades and associates.

Not only has this nation made itself felt everywhere, but it is the founder of the American nation and unites its force with that, to push the common civilization and thought cur rents into every part of the globe.

He offered me the position of super cargo in one of his vessels about to sail for San Francisco, &quot;around the Horn.&quot; I gladly ac cepted the chance, for it gave me both motive and occupation for the trip.

The consequence of the meeting and the pain of the parting may be in expressible in spoken language ; but how shall we know? Who will tell, or warn us, of the swift ly oncoming future, with its burden of weal or woe? As our vessel was devoted to freight, we, as I knew, carried but a single passenger, who by es pecial favor of the owner had been permitted to occupy the one spare cabjn. The rest of the space was occupied by the officers of the ship, in cluding myself. I had been introduced to this man, when he had first come on board, but be ing much preconcerned about the business I had in hand at that moment, I had simply responded"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 45 with the usual meaningless phrase of: &quot;Happy to make your acquaintance.&quot; But I remembered afterwards an impression of dignity of bear ing; of sweetness of real courtesy on his part; and that peculiar, indescribable thrill as we shook hands, which once or twice in a lifetime, it may be our good fortune to experience, as the lines of our lives cross with those who are es sential to our highest and best unfolding. Standing thus, leaning meditatively over the tafrrail, I came back to myself by hearing my name pronounced distinctly, in a low, musical voice, with just the slightest foreign accent. Looking around, I acknowledged the address, as he went on to say: &quot;I see you are leaving part of yourself behind you.&quot; &quot;Oh, not a large part,&quot; I replied, &quot;but I was thinking about the certainty of parting and the uncertainty of meeting.&quot; &quot;Don t you think that we part forever from"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 OUR STORY our friends, only when we have accomplished or finished all that we can do for each other. So long as our work remains undone we shall certainly meet again?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;that may be so, but it is the human uncertainty that saddens.&quot; Looking full at this man, to whom, with his every word, I was most indescribably attracted, I saw a picture, from that time indelibly stamped upon my memory. Tall, and almost perfectly proportioned. Eyes black, while in their ordi narily kind expression, one might easily imag ine their possibilities, when honest indignation or righteous anger stirred their depths. Hair and beard white, and worn a little longer than cus tom prescribed. His bearing was majestic in strength; serene in harmony; attractive beyond compare in its unselfish desire for the good of others. With all this, there was an impres sion, in all he said, he could tell very much more if he only would, about any subject concerning"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 45 which he might be conversing. It was such a face as children love and scoun drels hate, containing within itself the pitying tenderness of a mother s love and a father s sus taining watchfulness. In our interview, I passed from the outermost border of casual ac quaintance to the confident championship of sworn friendship. At this, too, I marveled, for I am slow to receive or offer friendship, but come slowly to the perception of what might be, in those who honor me with their good will. Although we stood some little time longer gazing upon the ocean, as the night and waters met in closer and still closer embrace, we lapsed into silence, with that strange feeling of being company for each other, although no word was said, and finally we descended to our respective cabins for the night.

He was a very eloquent and instructive talker and readily and gladly answered my ques tions. Especially was this true of things in the past, which the present generation has moved on and forgotten, and a peculiarity of his descriptions was that they were given as if personal experi ences of his own.

This land was indeed a continent, and the sea was the real ocean in comparison to which &quot;The Sea&quot; of the Greeks w r as but a bay with a narrow mouth. &quot;In the Atlantic island a powerful federation of Kings was formed, who subdued the larger island itself and many of the smaller islands and also parts of the further continent.

Here dwelt for many gen erations the renowned race of Atlan, from whom the whole island and sea were named Atlantic or Atlantis.

Moreover, there were vast numbers of elephants, spices, gums and odorous plants of every description ; flowers, fruit trees and vege tables of all kinds, and many other luxurious products which this wonderful Continent, ow ing to its beneficent climate, brought forth. These were sacred, beautiful, curious and infi nite in number.

In fashioning their interior streams they left docks cut out of the solid rock where their triremes could land their cargoes. &quot;The stone used in their building was of three colors, white, black and red, so that many of the buildings presented a gay appearance. Their walls were covered witii brass (which they used like plaster), tin and orichalcum, which had a glittering appearance. &quot;Northeast of the center of the Continent, stood the great Temple.

The whole city teemed with a dense population. The main canal and largest harbor were crowded with merchant shipping re turned from, or making ready to sail for, all parts of the world. The din and tumult of their commerce continued all day long, and the night through as well.

They surrounded this plain with an enormous canal or dike, 101 feet deep, 606 feet broad and 1,250 miles in length. By it the water from the mountains was con ducted around the whole plain, and while a part flowed out to the sea, the rest was husbanded for irrigation.

But, as I could see, the oper ations upon which he was engaged were very complex and far reaching and concerned some of the mightiest secrets of planetary creation.

While he had been thus busy it had occurred to me I had an odd volume in my locker I had picked up in a second-hand stall in Boston, in tending to examine it at my leisure. Now, hav ing my interest aroused I brought it out and found among much that was quite discursive, the following pertinent paragraphs: &quot;The fourth Continent, which it has been agreed to call Atlantis, was formed by the coal escence of many islands and peninsulas that were upheaved in the ordinary course of evolution and became ultimately the true home of the great race known as the Atlantians, a race developed"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 59 from a nucleus of Northern Lemurians, cen tered, generally speaking, towards a point of land in what is now the mid-Atlantic Ocean. &quot;In connection with the Continent of Atlan tis we should bear in mind that the account which has come down to us through the old Greek writers contains a confusion of statements, some of them referring to the great Continent as a whole, and others to the last, small island of Posidonis. Plato, for instance, condensed the whole history of the Continent of Atlantis, cov ering several millions of years into an event, he located upon the island of Poseidonis (about as large as Ireland) ; whereas, the priests spoke always of Atlantis as a continent as large as Europe and Africa put together. Homer speaks of the Atlantes and their island. The Atlantes and the Atlantides of mythology are based upon the Atlantes and Atlantides of history. The story of Atlas gives clearly to us the clue. Atlas is the personification in a single symbol of the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60 OUR STORY combined continents of Lemuria and Atlantis.

And as both Lemuria, destroyed by submarine fires, and Atlantis submerger by the waves, per ished in the ocean depths, Atlas is said to have been compelled to leave the surface of the earth and join his father lapetus in the depths of Tar tarus. &quot;Atlas then personifies a continent in the West, said to support heaven and earth at once; that is, the feet of the giants tread the earth while his shoulders support the sky, an allusion to the gigantic peaks of the ancient continents, Mount Atlas and the Teneriffe Peak.

I men tion this as explanatory of some events which happened a little later. The winds had been brisk and favorable, but as we approached the Spanish Main they grew fitful, and when we had traversed a part of that West Indian Archipelago, they fell away into a dead calm. Our ship drifted a little to the South, but made no particular headway. On the third day, the moon fulled at noon and we were lying in about 30 degrees North lati tude and 42 degrees West longitude, when my friend asked me if I would like to go with him"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 63 to visit a peculiar looking island, about a couple of miles to the westward. Upon my rather eager assent, the captain granted us the use of his yawl, and though he proffered us the help of some of the crew, our friend declined, saying he had been much accustomed to the water. We pushed off, I taking a pair of oars and he steering. I had hardly taken a couple of strokes with the oars, when I felt that the rapid im pulsion of the boat was not due to my strength. I glanced at my companion. His face was set with a peculiar expression, of which I had be fore had experience in other directions. A very short time sufficed to bring us to this island, which on closer inspection seemed to be the summit of some huge obelisk or pillar, a little raised above the waves. The sides, although not high, were sheer and precipitous. In the still waters they extended below the surface, as far as vision could penetrate. How much farther, I had no means of ascertaining. We rowed slowly"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"64 OUR STORY around it. It was about 150 feet in circumfer ence. On the side farthest from the vessel the face of the rock was broken jaggedly by the weather. The projections gave opportunity for fastening the yawl, and for climbing to the sum mit. If there had been any swell of the ocean even this would have been impossible, but with a sea of glass all about us it was not a very dif ficult task. Having securely knotted the boat s painter to a stout protuberance, we scrambled as best we might to the top. To my utter surprise, instead of the flat, solid mass, roughened by the weather, which I expected to find, it was cup-shaped in the center, evidently filling with water during storms, and drying out under the hot sun. It was now dry at the bottom. Looking closely at the sides I saw that instead of being a mass of natural rock, it was a structure built of masonry by cunning hands, so perfectly and solidly as to defy, thus far, the fierce action of the most erosive forces of na-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 65 ture. The floor was laid in regular flagging. Almost stunned by the discovery, I turned to my companion, but my exclamation of surprise was checked by his actions. Standing erect, in the very center, with his face to the North, guiding himself by a small compass and a little square of parchment, upon which characters were inscribed, he turned 15 degrees to. the East and stepped forward one pace. Then turning 15 degrees more he stepped forward another pace. He repeated this operation until he faced due East. There standing erct, his form seemed to dilate, and his face grew fixed and set in its whole outline. All at once I perceived a large disc of stone had revolved at his feet, exposing a flight of stone steps leading into a room below. Coming back to himself he motioned me to fol low him, and slowly we descended the stairs into an ante-room below, opening into a larger room. As we stepped upon this floor a light which came from nowhere in particular, lighted up the whole"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66 OUR STORY interior. Limitless age had laid his desecrating hand upon everything. But as this had been her metically sealed by the waves, the dust that would otherwise have accumulated in the upper air was not present. In the center of the room were five stone seats, on each was a little pile of dust. My companion, still silent, stepped to the East, and facing the seats, made one of the signs of Power. As he did so I thought I heard a suppressed sob of joy, but it was not distinct enough to be unmistakable. Then going to the exact opposite side of the wall, which was par titioned into a series of curious entablatures, he touched some mechanism, which, preserved through the ages, obeyed the will of this won derful man. A door slid back, through which we passed into a chamber below. Here we found seven seats. On each rested those curious little piles of dust.

Turn ing to the Eastern face of the wall, from a niche therein he drew out a little stone box. Holding this carefully, he retraced his steps towards the upper air, closely followed by myself. With the greatest care he closed behind him every av enue, thus sealing once more for future unfold ing, whatever there might be of knowledge or mystery here concealed. When the disc at the top had rolled into its place, a roll of pigment was placed in his hand by unseen helpers. With this he traced upon the tightly joined edges a character which burst into a silvery flame as it appeared upon the stone, and left a blood-red mark behind it. Then proceeding to the side where the boat lay waiting for us, we managed without any difficulty to seat ourselves in it and push off, he steering, as before.

On my part the silence was involuntary. I seemed to stand in a vortex of recurring memory, coming down over whelmingly upon me. I was too busy within myself in attempting to readjust the past, the present and the promises of the future, to leave any time for the frivolity of speech. I could not resist the feeling that these rock-ribbed cham bers were, in some peculiar way, a part of my self. I knew I had been perfectly familiar with the purposes of their erection, their use, and of some final issue, appalling and benumbing in its effect. More than that. The five seats of the upper chamber and the seven seats of the lower, to my inner vision, were filled with an occu pant, shadowy, but so distinct I could recognize the features, as one recalls the lineaments of a long absent friend.

When my friend made the sign I mentioned, a burden of untold weight was lifted from my shoulders, as if an expiation were finished, a terrible mistake rectified whose consequence all my life, up to that hour, had cramped and restrained all my unfolding and its energies. All this and much more that words will utterly fail to portray, held me silent as my friend did, what he evident ly came to do, taking me as an involuntary ac complice. Sitting in the stern of the boat, facing me, with the stone casket resting on his knees, he looked at me with a grave smile, and said : &quot;My brother: I see my confidence in thee was not founded in simple assumption, but in knowl edge.

The action of the sympa thetic exaltation on myself was beyond the power of words to describe. It was as if one had sud denly come to a perception of almost infinite power, and without a particle of arrogance in the possession. I could only reply: &quot;I feel that we must have been brothers, but you do me great honor in naming me thus.&quot; &quot;Before we reach the ship I must tell you,&quot; continued my comrade, &quot;that it has been per mitted you for purpose, to revisit the tower of the Great Temple of Atlantis, in which were gathered for concentration during the last awful cataclysm which sent the continent beneath the waters all the living members of the most po-"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 71 tent Brotherhood that has ever existed. &quot;You entered the chambers of the three, the five and the seven.

We do not know whether the masonry of the upper stories will be able to resist the erosion of fierce tropical storms or not, as little by little it reaches the surface. &quot;It was thought best by the Brotherhood to rescue this;&quot; here he touched the little casket, &quot;before it might be overwhelmed and forever hid den by the insatiable maw of the waters.

They could not be set free entirely from its responsibility until such time as either the bounds were destroyed, as in the upper chamber, or one clothed with authority entering their resting place should give them their signal of release, which I did. Below the seven, the failure of conditions above absolved the members of the remaining chambers, and they were set free in a very short time after the cataclysm. &quot;You are well known to me as to the rest of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 73 the Ancient Brotherhood, and have been chosen again as in the long ago past, to be the spokes man of our beloved Order, in its newest appeal to mankind, and we are sure that mistakes of the intellect in the past will not be repeated in the present.

The most important object of our voyage, the possession of these records, which no person liv ing or dead could obtain without your actual presence in the flesh is accomplished. The voy age was planned and undertaken for this pur pose, and will result as planned. Our vessel has been lying over the entrance to the great port, at the mouth draining the Atlantian Con tinent, from which, before the overthrow, a mag nificent panorama of the fairest land the sun ever shone on, was visible. &quot;We could not accomplish our object until near the full moon, so the calm has lasted until this time.

It seemed quite a matter of course that the sole object of my making this voyage was the accomplishment of what I now, with mortal ears, for the first time heard. Nay, more, I felt a certain enthusiasm, a quiet joy in being thus permitted to do the task, whatever it might be that was set for me, as an integral factor of the whole, to complete. I know that this is not at all the thing likely to happen, according to deduction from what we know of human nature.

As we reached the deck my friend showed his casket, as a curious souvenir of the stone pile we had visited. After looking at it casually they assented to the fact: &quot;It was a nice bit of rock, looks a trifle water-worn though.&quot; And so, knowledge of incalculable value passed beyond their reach, forever; or at the least, until the re finer s furnace of the ages shall have prepared them more fully for the perception of that which may at any time be offered them."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V. AS the sun sank on the Western horizon a northeastern wind began to strain out our &quot;idly flapping sails,&quot; and the good ship once more moved merrily over the waters. The full moon of the tropics climbed out of the great wastes of waters, and my friend and I sat on the quarter-deck, chatting of various matters. Suddenly, as if some one had spoken to him in reminder of some event, he said ; &quot;Yes, certainly; at once.&quot; A moment after, the stone casket which I had seen in his cabin just before sunset, was put into his hands, coming about as fast as a man would walk, out of the companion way. At that time no one else was near us on the deck, therefore no remarks were made. In my peculiar state of mind this, too, seemed"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 77 perfectly natural, as well as what followed. Taking the casket in his hands he pointed out to me several characters and symbols en graved deeply in the stone. Calling my atten tion to a form of the winged globe, he said: &quot;That is the signet seal of him who was our most learned, Ancient Brother. It holds the contents of the casket in trust for him wEo hath the password.

If thou art he whom I have expected to meet, it is well. If not,, then it is still only patience for further waiting.&quot; He held out his left hand, palm up. I placed my own left hand upon it, palm to palm. As I did so, a little shock passed over my whole body like an electric thrill, only a little more intense. His eye shining with a piercing brilliancy, caught mine. Then I felt another hand lying on the back of mine, and a form shadowed out of the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"7$ OUR STORY thin air by my side, and simultaneously I could see the full, regal proportions of a most majestic figure standing beside us. Prominently out of the shadow, as when one feels the sun s rays, I could distinctly feel the brightness of another pair of eyes similar to those of my friend in the body. At the same moment of time there came ring ing through the air to my ears a low, musical chant. Instantly I appeared to be up-borne where beneath me a vast city lay spread out, in all its beauty and glory for many leagues. We three still remained together in the same relative position. I had lost all consciousness of any dif ference of condition in the three present, who seemed equal in every respect. At this instant, a single syllable from my friend s lips, indescrib able in its intonation, arrested my attention. Without volition of my lower consciousness, in exactly the same cadence I uttered a syllable, and then, like the soft, clear ringing of a silver bell,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 79 thrilled from the lips of our bodyless brother, the third syllable of a word whose awful powers all mystics concede. As the last note rang out into space the casket came once more fully into my consciousness. I saw it open slowly, until the cover turned fully back, and revealed a large roll of the finest papy rus, clearly written in plain but minute char acters of what we have supposed was a transi tion period of Egyptian civilization. My friend reverently raised the scroll from its resting place. As he did so a fragrance inimitable and of bewildering effect upon the senses poured from it. Holding this precious record of the past in his hands he said: &quot;For over 29,000 years, my brother, this papy rus has not seen the light.

The MSS. was a full and complete record of all that concerned that wonderful country, whose daring leaders, like many another seeking to manifest unusual power, have come in con tact witfi impassible limitations and pulled down their country and involved all in irretrievable disaster, because they lacked omnipotence to carry out their designs.

It begins with an invocation by the Scribe, as follows: &quot;I, Tlana, Scribe of the Mighty Three, to whom it has been given strictly in charge so to do, herein write the history of my beloved coun try. This is to be for the instruction and en lightenment of my people, when they, in the far off ages to come shall need more than bread, help to recurring memory. I demand for this under taking, the necessary assistance and guidance from the Brotherhood of both the Invisible and the Visible, so soon to become of the Invisible; from the gods of Wisdom and Power, and from the Supreme Ruler of All, that I may say that which is best and most instructive concerning the actions and conditions of our nation from its beginning to now. (About 29,000 B. C.) &quot;Our Continent follows the general outline of all the others now in manifestation upon the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 83 Earth. It is about 1,000 miles broad at its wid est point, and 3,000 miles long at its longest di mension. The surface is mostly level, consist ing of vast fertile plains. But to the West, North and East the country becomes mountain ous. From these mountains, as a water shed, a river with its branches drains nearly the whole length of the Continent. Its waters, diverted through an artificial canal and locks, forms the great port of the City of Atlantis, which extends from this canal, northeast of the central portion of the continent, quite up to the foothills of the elevated portion of the country. Among these mountains has been built the Great Temple ded icated to OM., who is the ONE, the All. &quot;Our records fail to give us any information of the beginning of man s occupancy here, and it is only through the power of perception of our wise men that we gain any idea of that begin ning. It is sufficient to say, when the Fifth Race men needed a home for their unfolding,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 OUR STORY they found it here. Their unfolding has been along the lines of the strongest development. We may therefore simply describe the conditions now existing as the outcome of the thought-forces of the most powerful nation of the known world. &quot;The fertility of our soil is unparalleled any where upon the earth. Our difference of ele vation above the sea level gives variety to our climate, and whatever grows otherwhithers on the globe, will grow here also, in the greatest luxuriance and perfection. We have no need to import anything grown out of the ground from other nations. &quot;Our supplies of minerals from the bosom of the earth are incomparable in their amount and abundance. We have all metals found any where upon the surface of the earth. We also have one, of which none has ever been discov ered in any other country. It possesses the duc tility and color of copper and the strength of iron. We have named it Orichalcum."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 85 &quot;The fauna holds every species of animal, which from here has been carried to all parts of the earth, there to find a new habitat and become of use to the children of men either for labor or pleasure.

In short, whatever mankind possesses in any degree anywhere, we also possess in vast abundance, far beyond our needs. Never has any State, Nation or Potentate ever before concen trated so much of wealth ; that is, surplus of sup plies of all kinds, as we hold to-day. &quot;No word but immense, will truly describe our public works. No nation has even dreamed of a Temple like ours, much less built one.

Do not consider that I am seeking to belittle"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86 OUR STORY others or to extol ourselves, but I am stating as fully and as candidly as I can, that which is really the fact, as I now write. &quot;The mountains have springs of hot and cold water which act as natural reservoirs. From them the water is conveyed by stone pipes to the public baths and to the private residences of such citizens as choose to avail themselves of the priv ilege under certain conditions. &quot;In the center of the city are the royal pal aces, and these are protected by three immense canals, which are built entirely around them, with two intervening zones of land. These ca nals are connected with the Great Sea by an other canal 300 feet wide and 100 feet deep and six miles long to connect with the port. &quot;The Great Temple is in the northeast part of the city. Its lofty tower bearing upon its top, the finest observatory ever yet built, occupies the northeast quarter of the Temple grounds. This and the Temple itself is protected from attack"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 87 on the North, East and West by the mountains, which serve both as a defense and a foundation to hold up the massive structures built upon them. &quot;From the mountains the city of cities extends in a circular form southward. Beyond the im mense area occupied by the city proper is still another, comprising upwards of 75,000 square miles, which has been cultivated from time im memorial, and is in fact one vast garden. This is liberally irrigated from the river and from a canal 600 feet in width and 100 feet deep, ex tending through the country i,2OO miles. Not only are these waters used for irrigation, but through a system of locks at the port, galleys are raised and lowered into the grand canal, where they both receive and distribute cargoes of all kinds of products in the interests of commerce. &quot;It is hardly necessary to mention that the population of this plain and the mountains is many millions. Never will there be so many"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88 OUR STORY people gathered in the same place at the same time, so say our prophets and Magi. &quot;Nor must I forget to say that the volume of our population is increased by the fact that owing to the dominance of the life-giving power of the spirit, which has not been weakened yet to any great extent there are three or four gen erations of men upon the earth at the same time, all strong and vigorous. As the necessary sup plies for the maintenance of the body at its best, are in the greatest profusion, nature in no sense retards the increase of population, but would support to the utmost limit the most prolific in crease possible. &quot;During the day the myriad sounds of voice and action that arise over the docks and the quar ters of the city devoted to labor is like the roar of a tornado on the sea, hurling itself against the embattled rocks. &quot;The Atlantian galleys have reached every port and nation under the whole broad heaven."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 89 They have laid the entire surface of earth under tribute to our commerce.

The only article of which we fail in making the supply equal to the de mand is a bright yellow metal, which offers a powerful resistance to the action of the elements.

Thus, in a way, it has become a measure of value, not only with us, but with all the nations of the earth. It is predicted by our Magi that this peculiar con dition, through the foul greed of man, will grow into a calamity for the whole race. The desire upon which its gathering by us is founded will become irrepressible and destructive in the more physical nations in the years to come. As, how ever, our nation has done no intentional wrong and have tried to deal justly, they can hardly be considered responsible for any such evil. It is also true that if evil does come upon the race we shall be forced to meet it in the long ages yet to come, as we are again called to face in new bodies the lives allotted to us. Thus far, strained intensity for acquisition has not acquired force enough to injure us in our development on any line."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 91 &quot;We are not a nation of flesheasters, for the warmth of our climate does not compel the con centration of food sought in the use of flesh.

In the way of review of what I have written, permit me to take my future readers to the highest summit of the great peak Alyhlo, and from thence point out the paradise of mountain and valley, hill and plain, interspersed with broad plateaux.

Beyond these can be seen the canal leading to the land-locked sea and the great port with its fleets of arriving and departing galleys from every quarter of the globe. These galleys move neither by sail nor oar, nor any impulsion of elemental force.

BEFORE going forward with the descrip tions of the MSS. let us do a little comparing with the present situation, as we now know it. The location of the Ancient Continent must have covered in part the Carribean Archipelago. If the land were so raised as to make the highest peak six miles high, there must have resulted two im mense inland seas where now is the Gulf of Mexico. Across these and the old continent would blow in constant succession the trade winds, bringing moisture and fertility upon their broad wings, for the teeming population. In configuration, there must have been a striking resemblance to our upper lake country. The range of mountains to the West and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94 OUR STORY North must have constituted the backbone of the Continent, whose peaks and table lands now form a chain of islands. On the line of drainage from the inland sea the Amazon must now be located. The fertility must have been the re sult not so much of a torrid temperature, as of the absence of cold winds, which gave a peculiar, equable, life-developing_climate, both for vege tables and animals. Everything possible grew, because there were no drawbacks to its growth. It was always seedtime; it was always harvest. Bud, blossom and fruit in all their different stages of maturity could be seen growing at once on the same tree. What is partially true to-day of the orange and lemon was then true of all fruit-bearing trees. So fertile was the original condition of the soil, and so great the wisdom of those who directed, that the matter of planting seed and gathering harvest became a matter of sequence and not of season. With this explana tion let us return to our manuscript:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 95 &quot;The change of condition from life to death is one accepted and welcomed by our people ; not in any sense feared, because during their long continued existence the monotony of physical life is fully satisfied and the only inducement for ac cepting prolongation is the increasing of the spir it s force and potency, with which we are well acquainted and fully educated as to its limitless possibilities. &quot;Our place as carriers for the world, has for many years been acknowledged. On all seas and in every port are the galleys that supply the world s marts, flying the Atlantian flag a winged globe in blue on a yellow ground. It therefore happens in our ample harbor, the myriad swarms of shipping, although loaded with the products of the whole earth are ours. &quot;The sailors of other nations dare not move out into the vast wastes of waters, separating the different countries one from another. &quot;Great warehouses lie along the water s edge,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 OUR STORY which is bordered from the sea, for many miles into the interior, by immense, solidly-built walls. These are raised high enough to be above any high-water mark of either flood from the interior or tide from the ocean. But floods were rather the result of changes in the amount of drainage, for the melting of snow on the mountains or in crease of amount from suddenly precipitated vapor, was a thing of but slight importance. &quot;The capital is connected with all parts of the kingdom by iron tramways, upon which enormous loads are moved by a motive force, whose secret only our Magi know. But the obedient force moves back and forth, drawing and pushing, as it is bidden by its controller, the heavily ladden wagons, to which it is harnessed. &quot;The whole city is built of a pure white marble, taken from quarrries in the Northern Hills, whose supplies are used not only for build ing at home, but also for export. So fine is the grain and so elegant the polish that the blocks"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 97 are used over and over in rebuilding in the cities of the Mediterranean. This stone cannot en dure the extremes of temperature of the North ern climate, but is amply strong for all that may be demanded under an Atlantian sky. &quot;From what I have already said, perhaps it will be plain, the city is laid out like a disc, with a segment wanting, where it is fitted against the foothills of the Northern mountain ranges. &quot;Broad avenues in semi-circle begin at the mountains and end in the mountains. These are crossed at regular intervals by other avenues, forming the radii of the circle, the center of which is the King s palace. There is no owner ship of land, save in the King s name as the rep resentative of the nation. It is held by our Magi, that no man can own anything in which his own labor, or some representative thereof, does not constitute a component part. All articles of handiwork therefore can be claimed by the con tributors thereto, but man has not, and can never"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98 OUR STORY attain, ownership in the four great elements of manifestation fire, air, water, earth. If he ever shall attempt it, disaster and degradation will at tend the attempt. If a man builds a house or plants a tree, or cultives a crop, then the house or tree or harvest belong to him, and he should be protected in his right to enjoy fully, all that can come from his labor. &quot;All lands are parceled out by lot, and the improvements only, have a price. He who would like his neighbor s location must, with his neigh bor s consent, buy the improvements, but the land has no more value than the air about it. &quot;The houses are built for convenience and comfort. Every family owns its own home, and when a young man takes to himself a wife, he has a portion of land assigned him, under conditions which make equable all inequalities of place, quality or surroundings. No crowding is al lowed, not even in the thickest part of the city. The buildings are of permanent material, fash-"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 99 ioned to let in the air and light. The underlying principle is a central open court, with the living rooms all about it. This plan is modified in many ways to suit the individualities and needs of the owners. &quot;The court is entered by a broad gate, swing ing easily on its ample fittings. In the center a pool with an overflowing fountain to prevent stagnation, cools the air and helps modify the vi brations. The water was supplied by an acque- duct from the mountains. This was so old that no Atlantian of the present people can give its age. But there are records in the archives of the Temple concerning the planning of the huge undertaking and the manner of its accomplish ment. About this pool the building stands, gen erally two stories, so supported on pillars, as to form no obstruction to free movement of the air. &quot;When the young couple decide to locate it is the custom to receive from the chief astrologer of the Temple a horoscope definitely naming the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"ioo OUR STORY number of the new family to come. For each one a room was built in the home. This special allotment prevents crowding, and is productive to the utmost, of progress and growth on all lines. &quot;Animals herd, man individualizes in his tend ency. At either end of the scale, acceptation of, or rebellion against the herding, indicates where he stands at any given time, as regards either his spiritual or his physical nature. If he is inclined to be brutish it matters not if fifty hands eating with his, dip into the same bowl of porridge. If he is spiritually unfolded he would prefer to ap propriate and use, in his own way, that which comes belonging to and prepared especially for himself. This is not, as it might at the outset appear, selfishness, but is the outcropping of the work which the Ego takes upon itself during the earth lives, the soul-building out of the in carnations. &quot;The rooms on the first story are larger and"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 101 mostly used for the offices of living, in which the family relations are concerned and perfected. Most of their leisure time is spent about the fountain in the court, where there are always agreeable shadows, with the blue sky above. The courts are paved in colored patterns with a kind of glass, and carpeted with rugs and mats woven from vegetable textiles and fancifully dyed. These goods are made principally for export. Be sides these furnishings, there are side by side, products of man s thought from every part of the earth, the richest and the best. None are blood stained as the spoils of war, for our traffic, in dustrious and honorable has made us beyond per- adventure the richest nation that ever existed upon the earth. &quot;From the first, we have traded everywhere. No galley of ours has ever been seized by the god of the seas and left lying upon the ocean bottom whether bearing our goods forth or bringing back to us the merchandize of other"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 OUR STORY lands.

Their houses and gardens are as much the king dom of that community as can possibly be con ceived. This is the rule of the spiritual and not of the physical. &quot;But I must not forget to speak of the streets and roads of the city proper and the outlying country. These are laid out on a certain gen eral plan, which once established has never been changed. Although they have been many years in construction and extension, every foot has been added under the direction of a master mind in conformity to a uniform plan adopted thou sands of years ago. So far as they are extended they are finished and lasting. The substance used for the road beds is our secret, of the whole"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 103 world. Our ways are dustless and noiseless. The peculiar composition readily yields traction to bodies moving over them. Never has there been so perfect a system of easy transportation upon the earth. &quot;The public buildings are always large, roomy and of varied styles, surmounted with domes, pinnacles and minnarets and ornamented with statutes of artistic design and workmanship. The material of which these are built is white marble. Atlantis can well claim not only the honor of being so created, but of remaining a white city. There is no darkening effluvium in the air nor the climate to obscure the white walls set in the great billows of surrounding green. Our Magi say, that in days to come, a nation on the Medi terranean Sea called the Greeks, will personify in their works of art, our beloved city as a beau tiful woman rising from the sea. &quot;The more important of these buildings are profusely decorated with gold, and it is for this"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 OUR STORY purpose that metal is so eagerly bought by the Atlantian traders, a poetical name the tears of the sun, has been adopted by our people, and by this it is most widely called here.

A description of one will be a description of the general plan of all. They are elliptical in form, with a foun tain in the center. The Atlantians are extrava gantly fond of the presence of water. At one of the foci are a number of seats, arranged like an amphitheater, built of stone and rising one above another. At the other of the foci stands a Tribune, upon which the speaker stands when public addresses are made.

Here the young Atlantians are educated in the things that belong to the nation, the family and to themselves. Our fathers had a saying we seek to make a rule of living: Eight years to infancy and play, eight years to boyhood and training in physical things, eight years to young manhood and learning of the world outside of Atlantis, and one thousand years to learning of the in visible and real.

The little variation, hardly perceptible at first, is increased by every increment, no matter how small, of each of the succeeding lives. This difference is increased also by the force of intel lectual power which comes to a nation and of necessity to the individuals of the nation, who will seek to occupy the best bodies and positions, as the returning egos claim place in the lives."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 107 &quot;Because of the absolute equality of the sexes the bodies of the women are just as strong and vigorous as those of the men.

HAVING thus far advanced in the descrip tion of the most wonderful city ever known to man, permit me to quote from the words of one who saw what he so fluently and graphically describes for you : &quot;To the Northeast of this island Continent is located the Great Temple, built both for use and symbolism. On a plateau of many acres in ex tent, where the gradually rising ground began to break into the foothills, the whole surface had been leveled and paved with some soft material, of which the Atlantians alone knew the secret. This hardened under the action of the sun and atmosphere, until it was like adamant. To the East, a belt of country reaching to the seacoast, but not on a level with it, had also been"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. n9 smoothed and paved, so that there was no ob struction to the eye, until it rested on the far-off horizon. &quot;Upon this broad expanse of level space, close enough to the mountains to be buttressed by their mighty arms, stood the great, white-walled Tem ple, facing the South, and the ample areas for assemblage. The closed courts and offices, and the cloisters of the Temple faced the mountains of the North, and thus secured for the Temple Dwellers the privacy needed for the Masters and student Brotherhoods of the Temple, who were seeking to know out of the Silence. &quot;The Temple proper consists of two stories, the first one consisting of pillars springing from the rocky foundations of the mountain and sup porting arches, which in turn, held up immense slabs of stone, the floors of the second story. On the first floor there is little or no inclosure, but within the walls of the second story it is all ar ranged for privacy and quiet thought. He who"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"120 OUR STORY looks over the battlements of the upper story, looks down about ninety feet, into the beautifully paved court below. On the East and West of the Temple itself, are gardens, groves of trees, fountains, running streams of water, domesticated animals, and flowers of every hue and fragrance. These are sacred to the Temple, but open to the people under the surveillance of the caretakers, except certain reserved spots close to the Temple, which are for the special use of the students and teachers. In the northeast section of the Tem ple building was the great tower and observa tory, fifty feet in diameter, rising 210 feet, a landmark and light extending hundreds of miles and ever a joy-inspirer for the sea-tossed marin ers of the State. &quot;Looking from the plaza in front, toward the interior of the Temple, its vast recesses, its for ests of white pillars and its high-lifted over-arch ing roof fills the spectator with awe. Nor was this feeling lessened by the cleanliness, the con-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIC 121 tinuous shifting of huge masses of sunlight and shadow, ever into new and indescribable gro- tesquerie. During the services the awful sol emnity evoked was of a character that modified the whole Atlantian thought and national pur pose. &quot;The great tower was commenced fifteen feet below the surface. The original trap rock was supplemented by a square block of concrete rock, and upon this was carried up the superstructure to a total height of 225 feet, the square of fif teen. Upon the floor of the Temple resting on a raised dais was the secret chamber of the Holy .of Holies. Across and through this, at High Festivals, blazed and flashed the Veil of Isis.

In the outermost court, or court of the people, were always gath ered those who had thoughts of their own, and who were undecided as to what direction they should take in pursuit of the light slowly dawn ing upon them. &quot;The inner court of the people contained those who have so far perceived, that they are willing to obligate themselves to carry out cer tain purposes, of whose full intent they can know but little, except that the farther end is lost in the light of life, and the halo of obligation. In this court they who seek must be fitted by train ing and preparation for that which lies before them, so it is natural that they who linger there, striving to advance, must do whatever they can through their own power of assimilation, by themselves. &quot;At the first, if the lesson is concentration, it is their individual concentration. If the lesson"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"124 OUR STORY is passivity, it is their own individual passivity. It is exactly as when one is learning to sing, as a beginning, the voice is trained to use its own pe culiar function alone. After this solitary prac tice, when some aptitude has been attained and a facility of use, then they are ready for the massing of singles for a united effort. It must follow then, that the outer court of the Broth erhood cannot but lap over into the inner court of the Temple. &quot;That which is done singly and alone, is ab solutely necessary for the next step in advance, which is to be made in unison with another or others, in the same way as musical students are trained by twos and fours for united efforts of action and harmony. &quot;The question considered in all this is, how shall growth and attainment be best accom plished? What is the basic principle? &quot;In music we say the sounds are set to a cer tain key, and however prolonged the action of the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 125 vibrations, the key and time will be the same, and all the vibrations are aligned. It is exactly thus, when the students come to act together on the occult planes, the vibrations which they produce will not, of course, be alike, but they must chord ; the parts of one vibration fitting and filling in with the vibrations of another, so there shall be no jangle. &quot;To get the best results it is always best that they who are in the outer court of the Brother hood should be watchful and careful lest the vi brations sent forth from themselves should be hastened or intensified or even drag through the thoughtlessness of their own carelessness. &quot;When once unity of action is attempted in this matter, it is absolutely necessary to success, that the key on which they start should remain the same. &quot;It is easy to see how intense passions, such as anger, or any of the disturbing conditions would interfere with the vibrations. It would be"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"126 OUR STORY like a chord out of tune in a stringed instru ment, where, though the strings do not give out the same sounds, still they must be in alignment. This alignment is the source of all music. &quot;It is not needful that the most intense feel ings of one s nature should be given rein, and al lowed to make disturbance, both for himself and those whom he is contracting. It is also, on a small scale, like the sharping and flatting at the wrong points, whereby the vibrations are changed, the harmony broken and discord be comes perceptible. &quot;It is also absolutely necessary that all condi tions in the outer which can cause a disturbance should be held in abeyance, when one desires to concentrate, in order that during a united effort for concentration the harmony and strength shall not be marred. This is true of all work on any occult line. &quot;It is not to be supposed when two or more of the Brothers are concentrating, exactly the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 127 same process is gone through within the mind of each. That would be impossible. The end sought for can be attained by each working in his own way, with the same thought. It does not follow because A does not perform his task exactly as B^does, that B should set up a dis turbance in the vibration as reflected from A, thus in a measure destroying the co-operation and effect to be produced. &quot;The law of the Temple then, is first, alone; second, in company with those who are seeking by united force to accomplish, as the Masters of Destiny, at all times, have been able to accom plish. Unity of action is most important, there fore we must guard against anything that can dis turb this unity. If vibrations, in their normal conditions lay along side by side, and one is hast ened, then the harmony is destroyed and the ac tion of the impulse is to increase the vibrations in the length of their wave force. We must, when meeting for united effort, insist that each"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128 OUR STORY for themselves, shall become their own guardi ans. Knowing that disagreeable things will oc cur, we must be ever prepared, at once, to put them aside. Having done this once, we shall be stronger to continue. Thus the music from our soul s action will not only affect ourselves, but those about us. &quot;Upon this statement of principles has been built the great law of the Temple: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. All the teaching and training, all the ceremonies and symbolism of the Temple are founded upon this law as the corner-stone of the religion of our people. Having given this brief summary of the truths, our priesthood have in charge, let us pass on to a description of some of the ceremonies of the Temple service, and, as an illustration, we will take the Great Feast of the New Year, as more fully including the whole, than any other. &quot;The feast of the New Year, on the 2ist of March, consummated and commemorated the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 129 Sun s re-birth, when, out of equal days and nights a new Spring and Summer began for the northern hemisphere, and the promise of seed time and harvest was renewed. &quot;At this celebration it is expected that every family in the kingdom should be present, either personally or represented by some member of the family. All the going and coming of the year is planned with this in view. It is considered a privilege for all the outlying population to be made welcome in the capital at this time. The feast lasts seven days. &quot;Let me attempt to describe at length, for no pen can truly portray all the wonders of that marvelous assemblage, one of the last feasts which took place, ten years before the destruction of the city. The government and people were at that time in their most perfect unity. &quot;About three days before the set date of the feast there could be noticed a little stir of prep aration all over the country. It was a quiet"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130 OUR STORY movement toward participation. If one had been lifted above, so he could have looked upon the continent as upon a map, there would have been perceived during these three days, long lines of travelers, some on foot, and others by every method of conveyance, moving upon the city in converging lines. As the time grew shorter the extent of these lines grew shorter and the ways close to the city and in the city itself were filled to overflowing. There were but few people in the outlying country who had not some friend or relative in the city proper. When the houses were filled, tents were spread in the gardens, and in all the parks and places of assembly. Thus there was a new appearance given to the light by its reflection from the tents, which were some of linen and some of cotton, but all bleached very white by a process known only to the Atlantians and never imparted to any other nationality.

On the first day of the feast, as the dawn brightened in the East, out of the early twilight, there could be heard throughout the whole city a low, muffled sound like the pour ing of a swift torrent through a smooth bed, and as soon as it was light enough to see all the outer courts and the great plateau of the Temple could be perceived, crowded with those who had ar rived to take part in the inauguration ceremo nies. Their faces were turned toward the East, between whose far horizon and the eyes of the numberless watchers no obstruction intervened. &quot;When the moment approaches for the appear ance of the Ruler of the Day, a low, sweet har mony, sounding in rythmic change, welled out"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132 OUR STORY upon the air in slow, restful time and far-reach ing tones, from the great Temple choir, who were gathered in one of the porches of the Temple, so raised as to be seen by all the vast multitude.

The minutes move quickly on, the invo cation is finished, a blast of trumpets accompany ing the final note; the orb of day, with tropical suddenness springs from his bed beneath the sea. As his first beams fall upon the countless multi tude, they drop upon their knees.

Again, in the evening there is a convocation at the Tem ple.

This em braced the whole people in its ramifications. It is not necessary to describe these in all their minutiae. But during these six days there was continually something taking place in the city, always having its moving force at the Temple. The moving of a procession through the streets, a convening of the Temple guides or guards, lec tures and talks from those who were so well qualified to give forth from full fountains to the inner souls, eager to be fed.

As the sound vibrates in swelling cadence, rising and falling amongst the echoing mountains, the ef fect was perfectly indescribable, for the Atlan- tians were especially celebrated for being sweet singers. When the singing was finished the chief instructor of the people stood upon a Tribune high raised, and there discoursed of the things which concerned them most intimately in the physical life; of whatever they stood most in need; of how the Sun was to them life and health, and plenty and peace, the sign and repre sentative of all good.

There are no sacrifices, no shedding of the blood of animal or human vic tims.

In the northeastern part of the Continent was a group of rocky mountains. These rocks reached far down beneath the ordinary level of the soil. They seem to have been buttressed up, apparently from the very center of the earth it self, but that it was not so, appeared by the future events. But in any event they were strong enough to hold tons upon tons of piled up rock in whatever shape it might appear. So, first the rocks were cut down to a level, and a huge plaza was thus cleared from east to west, in such a fashion that both the rising and the setting sun could be seen from any part there of.

This plaza was ample enough to hold in its con fines every single member of the Atlantian nation at one time. It was many acres in extent. It is wonderful how many people can stand on one acre, if they are only harmonious. This great plaza was necessary for the Con vocations, and the yearly ceremonies when all the people went up to the Temple to receive guid ance and instruction for the coming year. This Convocation was always at the time of the Ver nal Equinox when renewed impetus comes both to the vegetable and the animal. Thus the mountains partly cut down, left space also for the facade which was tunneled into for the interior of the building from the front, and to this excavation additional structures were added from time to time, to meet the necessities of the Temple Colony.

The rooms and colonnades all yielded to the unification of the whole, which was the education of the Tem ple Staff, and through them of the whole people. At the northeast corner, as I have already mentioned, on the foundations of solid rock, reaching far down into the earth, was builded story after story a tower, upon this tower s top was located the tallest observatory that has ever been known in the world. There, they who were wise, and who were considered best, after having passed triumphantly through the intrica cies, the education and unfolding of the lower de grees, kept constant ward and watch. Out of this tower, at its lower part, proceeded forth over the great area, the wall of the Temple in closing the Great Hall of Convocation, and the Temple proper, and from the Holy of Holies at the bottom of the tower, Light, Strength and Force, at times of Convocation, streamed forth"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"156 OUR STORY as the result of the united power of the Three, Five, Seven, Fifteen and Forty-five. But let us turn to a fuller description of the tower. &quot;The tower was 22^ feet in diameter at the highest point of the coping. It was built of hewn stone in the shape of the trunk of a tree, large at its base, growing a little smaller in di ameter, half way up, and then widening again. &quot;This model from nature, was considered the strongest form. The stones, as I have said, were nicely cut and laid in a peculiar cement, found in the southern part of the Continent, which once hardened was as firm as the rock itself. So the tower bore itself aloft, as if it were one solid stone. Over the top, at the distance of ten feet from the floor at the coping was a spherical dome. It was of glass, and more than that, it was made of a single piece, as transparent as water itself. Through this all the motions of the heavenly bod ies could be seen and minuted from convenient"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 157 points of observation, in the chamber below. The floor of the hall was of mosaic, wrought in figures, and when it shall reappear, he who is wise may read in this a history of the founding of the temple, its date, its object and the pur poses to which it was dedicated. At one edge there was set in the wall a circu lar disc that was movable at the time of the en trance or departure, for him who knew the secret spring. This was known only to the Three, one of whom was constantly on duty, in attendance on the &quot;holy of holies,&quot; of this Temple. There was another &quot;holy of holies&quot; in the great Hall of Convocation, but that was the symbol of the highest person of the &quot;Superior Wisdom.&quot; One was the Superior Wisdom and the other the In ferior Wisdom. Over this floor so tasselated was spread to protect it from injury, a carpet of heavy linen, woven so closely that it was almost im pervious to impressions from without upon it. The usual wear and tear of things earthly, did"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"OUR STORY not affect it in the least. This was stretched tightly upon the whole floor. Upon the upper surface of this was drawn a circle of the whole circumference of the chamber. Within this per iphery were drawn three other circles, which joined each other at their circumferences, and whose centers were each equally distant from the center of the great circle. Through these were drawn the intersecting equilateral triangles and the six-pointed star. In the center of these in scribed circles was placed a seat, one for each of the Three. In the center of the great circle was a tripod holding a censor, in which burned the Eternal Fire. In their invocations, when they were reaching out to conquer new territory in the invisible, it was absolutely necessary that the potency of the Three should be embodied in the outer circle. Co-ordinate with this effort, the potency of each must guard his own par ticular circle, while from the center it was es sential should be wafted into space, the potency"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 159 which could call and conquer. These were all used upon especial occasions. These vigils were nightly and daily and the record of their observa tions were carefully kept. These three were wise men, for they had risen step by step from the knowledge of earthly things and their en vironments to a point where they could perceive all that could or would happen, not only to At lantis, but to all the remainder of this planet. They had also attained the point where other furnishings were not necessary for their assist ance, for in the perception of the Divine Birth right, they declared themselves one with the All Potency, and so acted, so demanded and so per ceived. This perception finally engendered pride of station, which conjoined to their knowledge, was the cause of their overthrow."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV. IN considering the remaining secret Chambers let us remember that all knowledge comes from the home of the Great Gods the si lence where everything is, that is. Between the station of the Three and the Five, was a heavy floor of masonry, each stone of which fitted into all the others, even as one piece of solid rock is fitted into its surrounding rock. Had it all been one piece it could not have been more lasting nor more compact. The arch of the lower chamber was like the arch of the upper chamber. From the highest con cavity of the lower ceiling to the floor of the upper chamber was three and eight-tenths feet of solid masonry. The arch of the lower chamber rested upon or sprang from five pillars in the walls of the circular chamber. Between each of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 161 these a single piece of marble was set, polished to the highest possible point. One was white, one was black, one was white, one was black and one was white. Between the two white ones was a band of burnished gold, the art of pre paring which, after being lost for ages, was re covered again in Etruria, whose wondrous mas terpieces are the marvel and glory of the present time. It glittered and shone, as only that metal can respond to the artizan s hand. These mar ble mirrors were turned towards the earth, at a slight angle, and in them could be seen, as in the pages of an open book, all things that were happening, had happened or were about to hap pen. That is to say, by the art of the Wise Ones, these had become reflectors of the Astral Books. Whoever knew the cipher could read, but to know the cipher they must be able to perceive, and no person could be eligible to membership in the Five, who under training did not mani fest this power of perception. When the love of"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"1 62 OUR STORY learning and the desire for understanding had given him the first rudiments of the cipher, he was transferred hither. Then, as if in a vision, he was allowed to give proof whether he could see and read. If he failed he was returned whence he came for further training, if it ap peared the gift was his. If not, then only that which had happened to him was his as if he had dreamed it. It is not necessary for me to say that the Five were rapid and accurate readers of whatever their wills sought to know. That which was good was perceived in the white mirrors. That which was evil or obstructive was seen in the black mirrors. So long as Atlantis was in its greatest power and glory, so long was the num ber maintained as I have described it. But dur ing the last twenty-five years of the existence of the Temple in the city, the odd mirror in the white had clouded over in a singular fashion, growing darker and darker, until the final de-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 163 struction, and to-day, under the waters there are three black and two white mirrors; but when the hour of redemption shall have struck, the stain will be wiped away from the white. Once more there will be three white and two black mir rors. In the records of the past, written on the floor of the upper chamber, there was this proph ecy: &quot;When the three are all black, swift de struction cometh to the Temple and the peo- pie.&quot; This had been well known by those whose am bition should have led to higher and better things, and although they wondered at the con tinuous change for the worse, so clouded had their minds become by their selfish ambitions that no notice was taken of the dreadful warning. Although the chamber was solid and there were neither windows nor doors, there were means of ventilation by which fresh air was con veyed into and out of this apparent tomb. The means of entrance were the same as those of the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"1 64 OUR STORY upper chamber. Although no aperture communi cated with the sunlight, yet apparently the light from the great dome overhead, passed through the solid masonry, as though it were glass. What ever could be seen by the light in the upper chamber, with its magnificent dome of crystal, could just as easily be seen in the chamber of the Five. On the floor of this chamber also was an extremely fine, mosaic record of the nation, and of the occult happenings to the same. Over this was a carpet of the same material as that above, and a circle twenty-two and eight-tenths feet in diameter. Within this was drawn a pentagon, thirteen and eight-tenths feet on a side. From the center of each side of the pentagon to the point of contact with the circle, a semi-circle was drawn. In the center of the circle was a smaller circle touching all the semi-circles, four and eight-tenths feet in diameter. Where these semi circles intersected each other were four figures resembling elipses. At the point corresponding"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 165 to the focus the point farthest from the center, was the station of him who officiated. You will see when you draw these lines how intimately was the sustaining power of each bounded by the great circle of the environment. All were lim ited, supported and sustained. In the inner, the smaller circle representing with the center, the power of the One was reached and held by the semi-circle of each, and each was supported in turn by that of his brother, next to him, on the left, and by his own power, until the whole cir cle was completed. Here the triangle has become the pentagon and the symbol of the intimate relations of those who are brothers was carried out fully and com pletely. All the civilization the world boasts to day is the result of the vibrations set in motion within this noted tower of the Atlantians. Between the divisions of the Three and the Five were three feet of solid masonry. The roof was arched as the heavens seem to be arched,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"1 66 OUR STORY and this arch was lined with an alloy of silver, gold and copper, an alloy which the citizens of the world to-day would give much to be able to imitate. It was polished to the highest degree of finish, but strange to say, it did not reflect a single thing taking place in the chamber. It was supported in its place by seven pilasters : One of orichalcum, one of gold, one of silver, one of lead, one of tin, one of copper and one of platinum. This was used instead of quicksilver, because the quicksilver could not be retained in place nor form, and the platinum was its opposite. On the plate of platinum at its base, was engraved the proportions of the alloy used in this great con cavity. There were always sounds emanating from it. Sometimes they were sweet and harmonious, sometimes sonorous and turbulent; for it did not reflect anything within the chamber. It was a reflector of the nation s sounds, and of all those"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 167 with whom they had dealings. It was in touch with all the planets, and it was a curious fact that in reflecting the sounds it also reflected the colors of the sounds, because the same vibrations that make sound produce color also. So you see that in one chamber attention was called to the working of the One in the Heavens, and in the next chamber could be perceived the operations of man s thought on the Astral plane, and in the chamber of the Seven, we are now about to de scribe, the study was of the manifesting of thought in its first potency. Thus in each grade, ap proaching nearer and nearer to those to whom they ministered, and who should have been their first care always, and above everything else their supreme concern. This chamber also, like the others, was per meated by the light which knows and recognizes no obstruction. The light was of equal volume, quality and quantity as that which lighted the up permost chamber, and it had the same peculiarity"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168 OUR STORY of penetrating and giving distinct view. It per vaded the whole chamber, without having any visible source. Upon this floor also was written in mosaic, as in the other chambers, a continuance of the history and progress of the nation and the city. Over this, too, was spread, as in the other chambers, the carpet. Upon this carpet was a circle of twenty-one feet in diameter. Within this circle was described a heptagon, to the center were drawn radii, thus making each side of the heptagon the base of a triangle of which the two radii were the other two sides. Within each of these triangles was inscribed a circle, touching each of the sides. The center of these circles was the station of one of the Seven. In operat ing they might look to the center or the circum ference, or to each alternately. But whatever was done was always with the utmost harmony and unity of potency. There is still one more chamber of potent ef-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 169 fort, that is the Chamber of the fifteen. The Chamber of the forty-five was more that of a school of training than a laboratory of occult force. The thickness of the separating masonry was seven feet. In the center it presented a square rising above the roof of the Temple. Within it was a square room with the sides facing each of the points of the compass. Circular windows, one each, pierced the walls of the four sides. The one on the east was red, the one on the west was blue, the south was yellow, and the north, white. The floor was laid in tiles, and the tiles were of a material which generations of wear could not destroy. And upon these was a lesson which contained absolutely, from beginning to end, all the knowledge that man would ever need or could expect to attain upon the earth. The wisest might read it partially. To those lacking under standing, if they could decipher, it was still a .mystery and foolishness.

It is because he believes there are many, and that the shadows and changing illusions are of the es sence and quality of the real, that he diffuses his power and baffles his own inquiries. In this Chamber, in a semi-elipse were fifteen seats, seven on each side of the keystone of the arch. The roof was also square. In one of the foci was a crystal globe, from which light always emanated. In the hours of rest it was necessary. In the hours of day, light from the outer per meated the room. The crystal globe hung mid way from floor to ceiling without visible sup port, swaying gently with the movements of the thought currents about it. In the other focus of this semi-elipse three brazen serpents, sup ported on their tails and rearing upwards, held aloft in their mouths a censer in which burned"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 171 the perpetual fire.

Beneath the floor of the chamber of the Forty- five was hewn out the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; of the Great Hall of Convocation, so that the mysteries intended and desired to be communicated, could be made manifest to the people at the stated times and seasons. This was the ultimate out come of all this interlinking of organization. The chamber of the Forty-five was twenty-five by twenty-five feet, and the walls were twelve feet thick.

There was always close to the seat of the Elder Brother, another seat, and this, empty always to personal sense; to those who could see on the psychic plane was filled by an Elder Brother from the Invisible, as a mentor and guide, as an influencer of the Elder Brother of the visible, to receive whatever might be given either from his own knowledge, or by his com ing in touch more readily with the invisible ; thus"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"OF ATLANTIS. 175 receiving out of the realms of the Invisible that which was needed for instruction on any and all of the mortal-touched planes. A narrow staircase was arranged in the thick wall, which led to the chamber of the Forty-five, and a sliding door, opening to the lightest touch of those who knew, admitted into the chamber. This chamber was ceiled and floored sides, top and bottom, with wood they obtained from the country, to be known in the later days as South America, but then a large island. It was of a peculiar hardness, dark red in color, and suscep tible of the most brilliant and lasting polish. It was so well fitted together that it seemed like one piece. They who were the builders con trolled the elemental force, which was able to do persistently and in the finest manner, whatever it was set to do. So when the door was closed, it appeared as if they were in a shell from which there was no possible escape. There was no dan ger from any outer accident, except possibly an"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"176 OUR STORY earthquake. But for many hundred years no earthquake had occurred.

What these points of light were composed of, hundreds of men in the days to come, will give several years of their lives to know, and never be able to find out.

While there was nothing of it that appealed to the sense of sight, there was still such force that it served as an obstruction, al though invisible.

At the same time he demonstrated upon this invisible screen, exactly as he described, both as to what had already oc curred, or might take place. Did he desire to unfold a line of sequence, then as he talked of the sequence in a particular way, the whole com pany would see that all the sequences were alike; that everything moved forward on the line of the One Creative Thought, in perfect harmony for accomplishment of all events in manifestation.

Whichever method was used, the vibrations made themselves plainly visible to the sense to which they were addressed. Their vividness depended upon the intensity with which the thought was projected.

It was in the internal fires of unregisterable heat, that during the latter days of Atlantis, the im mense stores of gold and jewels, which the Tem ple Treasury held, were manufactured under PRIMAL CONDITIONS. In this also was illustrated the great law of Transmutation. As the Great Tower flung itself toward the mid-heavens, pointing everlastingly upwards, it indicated the constant search man is making to the extent of his ability, for truth, light and po tency. The part of the Tower that sank lower and lower into the bowels of the Earth, pypied the material and physical uses of that which was capable of transmutation. It also held within itself the lesson of the &quot;Descent into Matter&quot; man s environments. So far as man himself was concerned, it held also the doctrine of the Three Brains.

These means for personal adornment, were also used by all the people, even those in the humble walks of life, if Atlantis could be said to have had any such, the relations of poverty and riches long since had ceased to press on the at tention of the nation.

None of the uninitiated knew for a certainty of that which was going on within the mountain. Only to the Three was this knowledge fully con fided by the Builders. To them, long ago all material things which are deemed of any value by mortals, or of any use or importance what ever, had ceased to be of consequence, only so far as they might adorn or make beautiful, either the Temple or the City. Underneath the Sanctuary, entered by a door opening into the solid rock, at the rear, was a flight of stairs leading down into a chamber hewn out of the rock. Out of this another staircase led into a similar chamber, and still another, and another, and yet another staircase and chamber.

In the First Cellar, Spirits of the Air labored and toiled, doing the will of the Masters. In the Second Cellar, the Spirits of the Earth moved to and fro, intent on carrying out that to which they were set. In the Third Cellar, Elementals whose forms but thinly clothed the fierce, blazing fires within, solved the varying problems of metallurgy.

The tunnel from the Cellar of the Earth Spir its opened into an inaccissible part of the moun tain, on a little plateau, which was constantly guarded by an impenetrable veil of fog. The tunnel of the Fire Spirits led under the Continent, diagonally down to the volcanic fires of the Earth.

The next step was concentration. Notice the steps, submission, meditation, concentration. When the thought was well massed and the vi brations were uniform and persistent, then they were taught to project the concentered thought which had been the essence of their meditations.

The per fection was carried still farther in the Five, where they practiced the attracting of the vibra tions of unseen force, of any kind whatever into alignment with their own projection, thus con trolling the powers of the great names. It was as if workmen taking a ball of soft metal from the crucible or furnace, should whirl it rapidly in the air, until it had assumed a cer tain form, and then launch it forth to fulfill their will.
