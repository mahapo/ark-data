There remains only fragments: traces of physicalevidence and occasional pieces of oral history. How can we piece together thesecrets of our vanished heritage? An integrated approach, one that draws uponmany sources and clues, is our best hope. Myth and science can converge to offerus the widest possible lens to study this enduring mystery. And it is preciselysuch a bold scope encompassed by this fascinating new book.D.S. Allan and J.B Delair have assembled a mountain of evidence pointingdirectly to a worldwide catastrophe around 9500 B.C. They draw upon a vast rangeof sciences and disciplines to weave their story. And it is a compelling accountthat begins beyond our solar system, about 13,000 years ago, with the explosionof the Vela Supernova.A large fragment of this star, christened \"Phaeton\" by the classical Greeks,blasted across interstellar space and sped through the void. Then around 9500B.C., it careened into our solar system like a drunken driver. Phaeton, composedof pure stellar-matter must have been very dense and atomic, (almost certainlysub-lunar in size) and different from a comet or asteroid, to wreak the kind ofhavoc that ensued. Neptune wandered across its path and Phaeton, pulledsunwards, wrenched one of Neptune's moons from its orbit, sending it spinningthrough space like a celestial hubcap. This moon became the eccentric outerplanet we know as Pluto.Phaeton continued on its chaotic journey. Hurling past Uranus, its gravitationalpull dislocated the moons of Uranus. As the deadly foreign invader drew nearSaturn, one of the ringed planet's moons, Chiron, was alsoforced out of orbit. Chiron bounced into a new path circling the Sun to becomethe solar system's smallest planet. Jupiter and Mercury avoided the chaosbecause their orbits had carried them to the other side of the Sun and thus farfrom Phaeton's destructive course. It was at this point on its reckless journeythat Phaeton electromagnetically demolished a planet that existed betweenJupiter and Mars.The idea of a fifth planet at this location has been around since 1766 when J.D. Titius von Wittenberg noticed that the solar system seemed to comprise analmost perfect mathematical web, minus one of its strands. Titius von Wittenbergexplained this anomaly by postulating that there was a \"vacant orbit\" betweenMars and Jupiter where mathematical probabilities indicated that there should bea planet. In 1772, Johann Bode popularized this discovery and the notion came tobe known as the \"Titius-Bode Law of Planetary Distances\". Astronomers now had amathematical tool with which to hunt for distant planets within our solar systembecause the new \"law\" predicted where to look. Telescopes from around the worldfocused on the \"vacant orbit\" between Jupiter and Mars and were rewarded in 1801with the discovery of the asteroid belt. Was the asteroid belt the remnants of alost planet? And if so, what was that planet like? Allan and Delair use theancient Akkadian (Akkad was the northern half of Babylonia, Sumer the southern)name \"Tiamat\" for the missing planet of which the asteroid belt is a remnant.Three more planets still stood in Phaeton's reckless path: Mars, Earth, andVenus.As the stellar marauder, dragging the remnants of the shattered Tiamat and itsmoon, Kingu, with it, catapulted past Mars; the red planet's rotation was slowedby their combined gravitational pull. Mars' two rapidlyspinning moons may well be fragments of Tiamat it acquired then. After leavingits mark on Mars, Phaeton was now on a collision course with Earth chargingthrough the emptiness between Earth and the Moon. Phaeton's pull stretched theMoon's orbit and the Earth's tilt was altered, condemning Earth to a worldwidecatastrophe.The swarm of planetary debris accompanying Phaeton were veritable time bombs.Circling the Earth, they exploded one by one upon entering Earth's Roche Zone,showering our planet with a celestial blizzard of rocks, stones, and dust.Atmospheric blast effects, ignition, and pollution were prodigious. The Earth'scrust shifted and plunged it into upheaval. This was the day that \"Earth nearlydied.\"Phaeton continued its unstoppable flight. Venus \"flipped\" over, sending it intoa rotation opposite that of the other planets. Finally, Phaeton disappeared intothe inferno of the Sun.In 1976, through the writings of the Greek philosopher Plato, I becameinterested in the historical period between 9500 to 9600 B.C. In Plato'sdialogue, a learned Egyptian priest tells Plato's ancestor, Solon, the legend ofAtlantis. He relates that Atlantis had been destroyed in earthquakes and floodsof extraordinary violence. This great catastrophe occurred 9000 years before histime. We know that Solon's visit to Egypt took place sometime between 594 and559 B.C. This places the destruction of Atlantis some time between 9559 B.C. and9594 B.C. Allan and Delair reviewed hundreds of radiocarbon dates from aroundthe world in an attempt to date the Phaeton catastrophe. They found that a greatconcentration of dates averaged 9577 B.C., exactly amidst the time frame allowedby Plato's \"story\" of Atlantis!This is the key period of our solar system's trauma. Before then, the authorsargue, the planets revolved undisturbed around the Sun during what we might calla time of celestial harmony, a golden age that was suddenly disturbed by anintruder from beyond our solar system. The massive destruction visited on theEarth was an extremely rare event which could recur but such a catastrophe isunlikely to happen soon. Allan and Delair are not doomsdaysayers, nor am I.Catastrophes happen. But catastrophes triggered by celestial violence occurindependently of human activity. Nor do they have anything to do with such anarbitrary date as the year 2000. This is not to deny the very real need ourplanet has for a shield against asteroids and/or comets. Where we can act weshould, but for the times we live in, it is perhaps more productive for us tospend our energy trying to heal the wounds that humans have inflicted upon ourplanet than to worry about another out-of-control Phaeton.Allan and Delair do a brilliant job in revealing that researchers have barelytouched the tip of the iceberg of events that shook the Earth around 9577 B.C.The questions go on and on. Finally, with Cataclysm! Compelling Evidence of aCosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C., answers are beginning to come, one by one. Aseach lost fragment falls into place we can once again listen with respect to the\"stories\" of the ancient ones who always knew that we live in a universe whichcan erupt in violence. This book is an essential handbook to our ancient past: abrave multi-disciplinary approach that should be applauded. With Cataclysm!,science, at last, catches up with mythology.May 1997Ladysmith, B.C.Canada.Introduction«^3>fc***S*?~»This book is about the greatest single disaster known to have befallen Earth.The event was actually part of a still larger catastrophe which, commencing ininterstellar space, eventually embraced most of the solar system. In terms ofgeological time it occurred extremely recently, although science has beendecidedly reluctant to admit the fact, and modern humanity has largely forgottenit.Among other things, the calamity profoundly affected all forms of terrestriallife, early Man included, who considered it to be a never-to-be-forgottenexperience. Accordingly, almost every nation of antiquity perpetuated the memoryof it in tradition, ceremony, religio-social attitudes, art and epic literature,and all regarded it as a major historical datum. Today, if it is remembered atall, it is known as the Great Flood or the Noachian Deluge.The relatively familiar story of Noah, his Ark and the Deluge is, however, veryincomplete, and when equivalent traditions from other sources are examined wefind the Deluge itself to have been but one aspect of an awesome event asmulti-faceted as a fine-cut diamond. These other sources refer to frightfulnatural convulsions simultaneously on land and sea and in the air, and to thegreater part of life on Earth being violently extinguished by a wide variety ofhorrific processes, accompanied by extraordinary concomitant phenomena in theheavens. The overall picture is one of disaster of the very first magnitude.For these reasons, the present essay encompasses what may at first glance seemmany unrelated fields of enquiry, but which, as the panorama unfolds, are foundto be intimately connected. In a sense, therefore, this book is really manybooks in one - although to satis-factorily explore all the salient features and evidence of what is an immensecanvas inevitably incurs a degree of incompleteness. Such an interdisciplinarystudy inevitably necessitates a rational and comprehensive correlation of thematerial discussed, and with that objective in view each major theme is fullydocumented throughout. Cited references include several which are unfortunatelyrare or difficult to procure. Irrespective of their rarity or otherwise, allreferences have been consulted by the authors.In this book we set out to demonstrate that the history of human culture is farricher and more complex than standard history is usually prepared to admit, andthat the true record of human experience is infinitely more dramatic than thatconventionally documented. As will be shown, a very great deal of this amplerpast was the outcome of a single traumatic event.Science has accumulated a body of factual observations which, in view of therelative stability of Earth's contemporary physical environment, so puzzledscholars that they felt obliged to postulate a series of devastating glacialages to account for them - though the genesis of this assumed Tee Age' is inturn no less puzzling. Yet, other scientific findings have accumulated which donot fit easily with this glacial scenario. Such data often remains accessibleonly to specialist audiences. More significantly, when considered together, theyseriously strain orthodox explanations beyond reasonable credulity.On the whole, it is sensible to support or retain a theory only if it 'works',provided that, in drawing diverse fragments of knowledge into defensiblepatterns, it enables useful predictions to be made about the shape of furtherdiscoveries. Conventional glacial the-ory, however, fails to meet this criterion. In the face of mounting evidencemilitating against this likelihood, it repeatedly disintegrates under theconstraints imposed upon it by that evidence. On the other hand, research intoan entirely different domain - ancient traditions, folklore and classicalwritings - is providing us with an increasingly persuasive body of evidence froma wide variety of cultures. These bear remarkable similarities, despite the factthat the names given to the characters in the dramas bear superficially littlerelation to one another.Some anthropologists have understood this to be a consequence of fundamentalhuman characteristics which have shaped human cultures and have caused theinvention of similar myths by apparently diverse cultures. Others, such as C GJung, have given an essentially psychological explanation to this, in terms of ashared unconscious psychological disposition, which gives rise to such stories.Though we would not necessarily want to challenge such assumptions generally, wenevertheless suggest that certain of these stories originated from a real liveexperience of early humanity, and have evolved in an attempt to comprehend andpass on to posterity the experience gained.Alongside Glacial Theory, this book traces the successive rival theories andinterpretations which characterised the formative years of modern geologicalscience, showing that, at one extreme were 'Catastrophists' who sought toreconcile traditional recollections of a global catastrophe with the knowngeological data. 'Catastrophists' for long emphasised the fact that numerousDeluge traditions mention one or more celestial agents as having assailed Earthand caused that calamity, and that prolific evidence is available which can bereasonably interpreted as having originated from genuine experience of such anevent. At the other extreme, 'Uniformi-tarians' have argued that disasters ofsuch magnitude are completely contrary to the normal workings of Nature onEarth. They know of no self-inducing mechanism capable of generating aterrestrial catastrophe on such a scale - and since they discern no physicalproof of a conflict between this planet andsome other celestial body, categorically dismiss all such claims as spurious.They insist that the factual data used to support most 'Catastrophist' claims isexplicable - at least in principle - in terms of the widespread but slow actionof ice rather than of fast or violently moving water.It is thus paradoxical that worldwide memory of an appalling flood disaster hassurvived traditionally as a major event in the early history of mankind, whilstscience, having assembled a veritable library of facts dealing with the verysame period, interprets the same evidence as due to quite another cause.Charles Lyell's nineteenth century formulation of an alternative theory to'Catastro-phism', bringing in the fewest possible assumptions in order toexplain the natural phenomena, was admirable. However, wholesale adoption of his'Principle of Uniformitarianism', rather than continual investigation ofalternative interpretations actually serves us only if it can adequately explainevery relevant phenomenon. Since the inception of Lyell's hypothesis and thepresent, much contrary evidence has accumulated, which, were Lyell alive today,even he would find difficult satisfactorily to account for by uniformitarianconcepts.If we widen our perspective beyond the specialist discipline of geology, we areleft with the problem of the extraordinary testimony of innumerable livinganimal and plant species, as well as the great corpus of curiously consistentworld tradition. Even were we left with no option but to anthropologise orpsychologise the traditional material, no such solution can apply to thezoological and botanical evidence. Some other all-embracing unifying explanationis clearly required.We attempt this by examining the range of huge phenomena for which Catastrophismdoes have explanatory value, and for which Uniformitarian solutions fail. At thesame time we shall try to order this great body of data into what, we submit, isits proper perspective.This perspective will not, however, be found in conventional Establishmentgeological histories, for although the overwhelmingxii Cataclysm!number of sources cited are Establishment sources, standard college texts on thesubjects discussed are, like those in nearly all scientific disciplines (and formany reasons), notoriously slow to modernise. Indeed, many orthodox textbookslag more than a decade behind the current frontiers of the subjects with whichthey profess to deal. Several of the conclusions paraded in this book willtherefore be found to be diametrically opposed to many normally featured inorthodox texts. These deviations have not, however, been reached lightly, butare solidly grounded on the testimony of abundant and varied field evidenceoften either ignored, dismissed, or forced by many conventionalists to fitvarious notions that, although well-entrenched and frequently treated as fact,are actually hypothetical or even demonstrably untenable, or so recentlydiscovered that they still await incorporation into standard histories.Some readers may recoil at the abundance of references and might even regardthem as irksome or intrusive. In a work of this genre precise documentation isessential, and in point of fact the references used actually constitute a rathersmall but representative fraction of the total available on the themes reviewed.There may also be disapproval of the use of a comparatively high percentage of'old' sources. Such objections will speedily dissipate when it is realised thatmany of the most singular events and discoveries referred to - particular localterrestrial cataclysms, certain Arctic and Siberian explorations, specific caveexcavations and finds - occurred long ago and were essentially unrepeatable. Insuch cases these are the only references that can be cited. But whether 'old' orrecent, it is significant that the character of the drama thus documentedremains persistently consistent. Furthermore, the physical events and effectsdescribed in many traditional accounts are precisely those advocated bymodern theoreticians considering essentially similar themes.Every effort has been made to keep technical terms to a minimum, but where usageof these has proved unavoidable, concise explanations are contained either inthe text or in the glossary.In dating specific evidence we have used the convention of expressing dates inyears BP (before the present). Current processes for estimating the age offossil remains, rock strata and so on all have certain limitations, so that thetime-scales used by geologists, palaeontologists, anthropologists and othersinevitably contain a degree of uncertainty. Our chronological estimates derivefrom averaging out from a wide range of documented radiocarbon dates and otheraccredited methods. We are therefore as confident as it is presently possible tobe in their general reliability. Appendix B summarises the relevant datingprocedure and cites a selection of the abundant data now available.Readers must perforce judge for themselves whether the facts genuinely supportthe conclusions here offered. What cannot be denied however is that real facts,howsoever interpreted, are inescapable, actual and immutable, and the testimonythey represent cannot be altered.If the conclusions arrived at in this book prove to be valid, then recent Earthhistory as we know it urgently needs extensive revision. In effect they providea new key to that segment of world history occupying approximately the last15,000 years. The genesis of much of present world topography merits fundamentalreassessment, prehistoric archaeology an equal adjustment, and the scientificconcepts of uniformitarianism and cat-astrophism, with their bearing on organicevolution, very substantial modification. Perhaps with this new key, we nowstand at a threshold of new and exciting historical perspectives.Part OneA LOST BEGINNING160180160120100100picture0 [images/picture0.jpg]Map 1 A. The Arctic regions today. A major key for unlocking the Phaetonquestion.The Age of the Earth^'^s^/H^^^r*Today, educated society is fully aware that, compared to the average humanlife-span of three score years and ten, the age of the Earth, which moderngeology has divided into successive eras and periods each millions of years induration, is absolutely immense. Yet this concept was not always so, and was notin fact seriously developed until the first half of the nineteenth century.Before then, researchers had tried to establish the age of the Earth by studyingancient calendars 1 , and various assertions about 'time' in classical, NearEastern and Norse literature 2 , or by working out and totalling the recordedgenerations of Biblical figures between the traditional 'first man', Adam, andthe birth of Christ 3 . Regarding this last mentioned method, the existence ofdifferent translations of scriptural sources only served to compound thedifficulties. Some authorities, for example Isaac Vossius of Leiden, contendedthat the most authentic biblical genealogies are to be found in the originalGreek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, rather than in theMasoretic Hebrew texts 4 . Others disagreed. Thus, the age of the worldcalculated from Patriarchal genealogy as recorded in the Septuagint produced adate of 2,342 years, whereas that based on the Masoretic texts gave a date of1,656 years 5 .That no really precise date for the age of the Earth was forthcoming fromvarying sources like these quickly became transparently obvious.Early scholars everywhere recognised that, so far as it was known to them, agreat break had occurred in Earth's history, or at least in the human portion ofit. The break had been caused by a vast flood, which for Christian and Jewishhistorians was the Deluge of Genesis, and for classical writers the GreatFlood of Deucalion. To all these authors this inundation became a highlyimportant marker event\".Not only Christian and Jewish savants, but others of the pagan pre-classical andoriental worlds, agreed that the Deluge had terminated an earlier Golden Age,itself conceived of in many quarters as one of a succession of former world agesindividually characterised symbolically by metals (bronze, iron, etc), elements(fire, water, etc), or by astronomical motifs (solar, lunar, etc). Moreover,ancient traditions collected much later from lands such as the Americas andAustralia, certainly unknown to most early European, Near Eastern and Orientalwriters, also preserved closely similar beliefs in which 'suns' were sometimessubstituted for 'ages' as vague measures of spans of time long past.Tantalisingly, the actual durations of such 'ages' or 'suns' were seldom if everstipulated.Other early thinkers, especially those of pre-Hellenic and early classicalGreece, devised the concept of cyclical world history, which, because itpostulated a succession of different ages, again involved the idea of greatspans of time. These, though of vague durations, were usually stated in termsindicating an antiquity far greater than the 1,656 and 2,342 year dates obtainedby biblical studies. This doctrine was followed by, and probably led to thedevelopment of, that of the cyclical Great Year, championed by Empedocles andthe Pythagorean philosophers of ancient Greece. The doctrine itself wasapparently based upon earlier Chaldean teachings which advocated that theUniverse, though eternal, undergoes cyclical destruction from either fire orwater at lengthy but irregular intervals. The Deluge was held by them to be themost recent of thesedestructions. Popularised by Berosus, a Babylonian scribe of the 3rd century BC,the doctrine of the Great Year became very influential and was subscribed to bymany famous cosmologists and philosophers of the day, including Chrysippus, Zenoand Plato. It survived in modified form down to at least the beginning of the19th century.An especially noteworthy aspect of the above topic is that all accounts of theDeluge shared the notion that, in addition to it having been a very destructiveevent, it was somehow connected with celestial changes. In some narratives,these are ascribed to heavenly displeasure or divine wrath at a reportedlyiniquitous mankind. This factor, and the ancient concepts of bygone World Agesand a lost Golden Era, will be considered again more fully later.Thus, irrespective of their literary or traditional sources, their advocatedreligious significance, or their alleged social connotations, all these accountswere as one in agreeing that a tremendous watery cataclysm had indeed occurredlong ago and drowned the greater part of Creation. As one of the most widelyremembered and enduring of all human traditions, the Deluge became a criticaldatum in virtually every early chronology, it being customary then forhistorians to term everything preceding it as antediluvian (before the Flood)and everything following it as post-diluvian. It was not until 525 AD that thenow standard method of dating events BC and AD was introduced.Even in the days of the earliest known writers, dates were proposed for theDeluge -another pointer to the great importance it then held for historians.These dates were, like so many later ones, usually calculated in relation todates worked out for the Creation itself. Of these we may briefly mention that,in the 2nd century, Theophilus of Antioch calculated that Creation had occurredin 5529 BC, and that Jerome, in AD 381, thought it had erupted in 5502 BC. Somedatings attempted extraordinary precision. One Jewish scholar in the 2nd centuryAD averred that Creation had taken place at 11.11pm on Sunday, October 6th, 3761BC 7 .Many of these early datings, as well as many later medieval ones, were commonlyset to accord with the six days of Creation described in Genesis, and togenerally conform to Julius Africanus's combination, in the 3rd century AD, ofthe 'six days of Creation' and the 'Millennium'. Relying upon the authority ofPsalms 90:4, and the virtually sacrosanct assurance of the Christian apostlePeter that for God one day is as a thousand years, Africanus reasoned that thesix 'cre-ational' days really meant six thousand Earth years. It was not long,therefore, before scholars like Augustine, Lactantius, Isadore of Seville andthe Venerable Bede began dividing up human history into Six Ages totalling sixthousand years, although not necessarily of one thousand years each. As remarkedby Prof Dennis Dean, who undertook a special study of this theme:Eventually, schemes involving seven 'days' (with present time the sixth) becamepopular. These related conceptions of the Earth's history endured well into theseventeenth century, where we find them influencing geological theories byDescartes, Kircher, Steno, Burnet, and Whiston. Few erroneous historicalassumptions have ever remained credible for so long 8 .A great up-welling of scholastic interest in the age of the Earth occurredduring Renaissance times, and in England alone over one hundred differentauthors, working along different lines of enquiry, proposed dates for theCreation. Even those utilising solely Hebrew sources managed to differalarmingly, their datings ranging from 3928 to 4103 BC.Inevitably, by Renaissance times there were those who doubted the validity ofbiblical chronology as a whole, and those who redoubled their efforts todiscover the real date of Creation. Among the latter was James Ussher whosemonumental study of the problem, first published in Latin 10 , appeared fouryears later in the English language version of 1658 - The Annals of the World,Deduced from the Origin of Time (London). Ussher convincingly argued forCreation having occurred in 4004BC, a date subsequently affixed to the Lloyd Bible of 1701, by which it quicklycame to be regarded as practically a part of scriptural authority itself 11 .Among the doubters were those who, even as early as the 1500s, argued that theBiblical 'days' were merely figurative. Others, like Isaac Peyrerius, postulatedthat, far from representing world history, biblical history represented onlyJewish history and that Adam was not the first man but the first Jew. LikeFriedrich Stoss in Germany, Charles Blount in Britain, and other Europeans,Pierre Bayle in Holland 12 voiced further criticisms about that time andproposed different chronological schemes of surprisingly lengthy duration, noton geological but on varied oriental cultural evidence. Some of these requiredCreation to have taken place far earlier than Ussher's 4004 BC. Indeed, by 1588,so much scholastic confusion and contradiction had been achieved that JohnHarvey found himself obliged to write with regard to all chronolog-ical compilations thitherto produced that they were:...ambiguous, uncertaine, fallible, erroneous, deceitful. 13Earlier, none other than the great Roger Bacon had concluded that the disputesbetween authoritative versions of the Bible respecting the age of the worldwould be resolved only by astronomical evidence 14 .Almost 300 years were to elapse before any serious attempts were made to developthat avenue of approach. Meanwhile, like practically everything else in the OldTestament before the Exodus, the Deluge was still not precisely datable, yetcontinued to be the only graspable world datum since, as mentioned previously,everything before it was indisputably antediluvian and everything after itobviously post-diluvian. For that reason it became an increasingly criticalhistorical marker event.Debris of a Broken World«^agfe->-t *? 'ry-aDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries efforts were made to exploreconnections between Mosaic chronology and the then fast developing sciences ofastronomy and primitive archaeology 15 , very much as forecast by Roger Bacon300 years earlier. Many of these studies embraced the previously-noted olderdoctrine of successive world ages and laid special emphasis upon the ending ofindividual ages by terrible floods and conflagrations. Inevitably the BiblicalDeluge received particular attention, although whereas nearly all earlyspeculations about it had concluded that it was the result of divine anger,these new investigations sought rational physical causes for itsoccurrence. Thus, in the opinion of the late seventeenth century Englishmathematician and physicist William Whiston, the Deluge had probably been causedby the close approach to Earth of a giant comet 16 .Whiston was Isaac Newton's laboratory assistant, and, like Newton, was a friendof the astronomer Edmund Halley, who may be said to have been the discoverer ofthe periodicity of comets (a subject returned to in Part Four of this book).Whiston was also well versed in ancient history, classical literature and theLatin, Greek and Hebrew languages. His invocation of a cosmic agent as the causeof the Deluge thus not only accommodated the aforementioned 'astronomical'elementsassociated with that event in many early histories and ancient traditions, butalso used what at that time were some of the very latest findings on astronomyphysics, and mathematics, including Newton's then recently announced Law ofGravity. Little wonder Whiston's theory was well-received in nearly allquarters, and significantly influenced historians over the next 130 years or so.No 'geological' chronology had been formulated in Whiston's day of course, andfossils, though well enough known' 7 , were still commonly interpreted as therelics of creatures (Earth's afore-cited iniquitous antediluvians) destroyed byNoah's Flood. Nor did any proper conception exist that, as an organism, man wassignificantly younger than the fossilised creatures found at innumerablelocalities, or of any vast pre-human period of Earth history.Nevertheless, we would be at fault here if we omitted to add that as early as1671 the naturalist John Ray may have had an inkling of reality when he opinedthat the world might well be \"a great deal older than is imagined\", and thathumans were late arrivals on the terrestrial stage when, in a letter written in1695 to the Oxford antiquarian Edward Lhwyd, he ventured:...whatever may be said for ye Antiquity of the Earth itself & bodies lodged init, yet ye race of mankind is new upon the Earth, & not older than the Scripturemakes it, may I think by many arguments be almost demonstratively proved 18 .Ray, however, was apparently not the first to reach such conclusions, for ThomasNashe, in 1592, had complained in a pamphlet about \"Mathematitions abroad thatwill prooue men before Adam\" 19 . Regrettably, Nashe did not name themathematicians concerned.About the time that Nashe was voicing his complaints another notable observationwas put on record. The French potter Bernard Palissy recorded that, whencollecting suitable clays preparatory to manufacturing his wares, he:...found many species of shell fish, petrified in the earth, which are notmodernkinds living in the ocean... a sort which is unknown to us, and are not found atall, except lapidified\" (fossilised). 20These were vestiges of some prior creation. The question to be answered was: didthese shellfish belong to a creation destroyed by the Deluge? The Delugecontinued to be a central point in the problem of the age of the Earth.We may also mention that, in 1655, shortly before John Ray's remarks, Isaac dela Peyere had pursued the same theme of humans before Adam 21 , in the processdistinguishing two Creations, that of things and that of humans. Observationslike Palissy's may have contributed to the formulation of such conclusions andundoubtedly underlay the arguments of the early eighteenth century French savantRene de Reaumur, who, in 1720, stated that the fossil record attested to aduration long preceding the Deluge 22 .Certainly by the mid-eighteenth century many writers, including Diderot 23 ,Buffon 24 , and Maillet 25 , were beginning to propose chronologies far longerthan that apparently permissible from orthodox analyses of world historysummarised in Genesis. Maillet, for example, argued for an indefinitely ancientEarth and a human existence of 400,000 years, while Diderot went even further instating that the world was \"hundreds of millions of years\" old 26 .Like James Howell, all these authors were aware that, long before, Apolloniusthe Egyptian had claimed that the world was 153,075 years old, and that theclassical Greek writer Diodorus Siculus had stated that pharaonic historyspanned more than 18,000 years 27 - plenty of time, even in his day, for twoCreations, and for humans to become sufficiently sinful to invoke divinedispleasure culminating in a universal Deluge.Now, while modern archaeologists have since shown 18,000 years to be grosslyinflated as a date for pharaonic history, they have also discovered that, likemany classical Greek thinkers 28 , and unbeknown to seventeenth and eighteenthcentury scholars, both the ancient Egyptians 2 \" and the Babylonians 30 took adeep interest in fossils and the prob-lem of 'time'. Apollonius's apparently wild claim of a world 153,075 years old,while actually much too short, was perhaps formed, or partly based, onlong-forgotten palaeontological investigations, and that a great deal ofseventeenth and eighteenth century discussion respecting the age of the Earthhad, in essence, already occurred more than 1,500 years earlier.Although Robert Hooke in 1688 had suggested that it might be possible to \"raisea chronology\" from fossils \"and to state the intervalls of the times whereinsuch, or such catastrophies and mutations have happened\" 31 , subsequent studiesshowed that fossils were capable of several almost equally plausibleinterpretations insofar as the age of the world was concerned, and that theutilisation of other less uncertain methods was preferable.Even as far back as the late seventeenth century these were being sought by menlike Edward Lhwyd of Oxford. He believed that the seemingly slow accumulation ofboulders in two north Welsh valleys was evidence that the age of the Earth mustbe far greater than then generally envisaged 32 . Lhwyd evidently omitted toconsider that accelerated rates of boulder-accumulation could occur throughsudden flooding, ice action, earthquakes or persistently torrential rainscausing landslides.Then, in 1715, Edmund Halley of cometary fame proposed the determination of theworld's true age by extrapolating from the sea's supposedly regular increase insalinity 33 . This method also proved to have only limited application. Later,Buffon's associate, J T Needham tried to calculate the age of the Earth fromsedimentation rates, but found the results so staggering that he could notaccept them 34 . In any case, sedimentation rates vary widely in differentlatitudes and under differing conditions.Later still, in 1779, the rate of advance by glaciers was advocated as anothermethod 35 , but that too was illusory. At the time it was unfortunately notappreciated that glaciers sometimes retreated, modern research showing that somedo on a cyclical basis in response to various environmental factors.During the mid-eighteenth century it was widely assumed that land-forms(mountains, valleys, deserts etc) and the rocks comprising them had been createdat different times. This led one writer, Johann Lehmann, to distinguish threekinds of mountains, created respectively before, during and after the ubiquitousDeluge 36 . But although the Deluge continued to dominate the thoughts of manynaturalists during this period, there were others, such as Baron de Holbach andMontesquieu, who argued for sequential destructive upheavals at largelyirregular intervals, each apparently devoid of design or purpose 37 . Theseideas reached a head in the writings of G H Toulmin, a medical doctor, whoconcluded:...convulsions and revolutions violent beyond our experience or conception, yetunequal to the destruction of the globe, or the whole of the human species, haveboth existed and will again exist... [terminating] ...an astonishing successionof ages. 38The Catastrophist school of geology, to which we will return shortly, was trulyborn through the writings of these authors.Contemporaneously with the activities and published opinions of the afore-namedscholars were the conclusions reached by Jean Guettard, now justly acclaimed asthe discoverer of the natural evolution of land-forms 39 . His discoveries wereto have far reaching effects on geology (the study of the composition, structureand origin of rocks) in general and, over a century later, in the development ofgeomorphology (the study of surface physical features and their relation tostructures and land-building and land-eroding processes), another importanttopic to which we will return later in this book.The eighteenth century, with its ever-mounting fascination with the age andstructure of the Earth, closed with two highly important geologicalturning-points, and with several singular discoveries. Of the former the firstwas the publication in 1785 of James Hutton's Theory of the Earth i0 , in whichthe immensity of geological time, altogether dwarfing Ussher's earlier 4004 BCdate, wasforcefully stressed, as also the Earth's essential stability. For Hutton, \"it isthe little causes, long continued, which are considered as bringing about thegreatest changes of the earth\". He emphasised the thousands of separate detailswhich, operating over a \"long succession of ages\", refute \"the hypothesis ofviolent causes\" that a truncated chronology would require. In these statements,Hutton launched what was later to become known as the Uniformitarian school ofgeological thought, a perspective central to the main theme of this book towhich we shall repeatedly refer.The second of these turning-points was the discovery in 1797 by a talented landsurveyor, William Smith, that Earth's crust is composed of a definite sequenceof fossil-bearing deposits in which individual strata (levels) are characterisedby distinctive suites of fossils (bygone faunas and floras) each peculiar to thestratum yielding it. Once again it was obvious that long periods and eras hadbeen necessary for the development of each of these successive organicassemblages - very much as Hutton and Diderot had independently postulated.Though well known in geological circles by 1800, Smith's discovery (which earnedhim the amusing nickname of 'Strata Smith') was not published until 1816 41 , bywhich time much further evidence supporting it had come to light elsewhere.The singular discoveries concerned the finding in 1772 of a deeply frozencarcass of a woolly rhinoceros near Vilui in northern Siberia, and, in 1787, ofa large portion of a hairy mammoth in the Yakutsk region of Siberia. Like someearlier poorly-documented similar finds in the Siberian Tungus, both thesespecimens retained flesh, hides and hair 42 .Such discoveries greatly influenced the deliberations of many late eighteenthand early nineteenth century naturalists, for it was clear that, since thesenorthern animals had been frozen instantly and had remained so until found,their demise must have been extremely sudden. Such suddenness betokened acatastrophically swift event, yet men like Hutton and Smith were discoveringindisputable evidence that such catastrophes were rare. Just as clear was thefact that, for the ice and frozen ground enclosing these carcasses to haveremained unmelted for the vast periods of time implied by 'Huttonian' theories,the destruction of these Siberian animals must, geologically speaking, have beenvery recent.The Siberian finds increased naturalists' interest in the numerous mammoth andwoolly rhinoceros bones which had long been known from, and were indeed stillbeing met with in, more southern European latitudes. These, it was quicklyrealised, generally occurred either in caves or rock fissures or in superficialsurface deposits like sands, gravels, clays or marls. Usually unconsolidated(loosely held together), these deposits were also largely unstratified(unlayered) and often of very irregular linear extent and thickness, exhibitingevery sign of having accumulated under agitated conditions which had apparentlyaffected huge areas of the globe more or less simultaneously. Due to theexceptional nature of these surface deposits special names were coined todistinguish them, eg, 'Boulder Clay', 'Hard Pan' and 'Till'. Researches showedthat the lowest of these deposits, the 'Till', usually lay directly upon solidbedrock, the upper surface of which, irrespective of the kind of rock involved,had frequently been smashed, fissured, striated (marked with linear ridges,furrows or scores), polished or pulverised into countless fragments. Thisphenomenon not only extended surprising lateral and vertical distances, but hadaffected a great variety of extremely hard rocks.To most naturalists at the time it was perfectly obvious that some tremendousevent had occurred which, among other effects, had fractured hard rocks overimmense distances, and had deposited the resultant debris equally extensively asgravels, sands, clays and muds. The bony remains of the hordes of animals whichhad been destroyed by the event now lay within these deposits, which, innorthern Siberia, had become permanently frozen. All these interrelated remainsthus represented the debris of a former but now-broken world.Clearly any agency capable of venting so much devastation must have been notonly awesomely powerful but must, from the evidence, have affected the entireworld. Late eighteenth and early nineteenth century scholars rapidly expandedtheir concepts of terrestrial chronology from thousands or tens of thousands ofyears to spans of time stretching to many millions of years, and to the notionthat for a large part of these immense periods quiet and equable conditions hadprevailed 43 . On the other hand they were being confronted with mountingevidence that something traumatic, something catastrophic, had affected thewhole Earth, geologically extremely recently.Men were not long in concluding that this event had been the Deluge of Genesisand widespread tradition, and that perhaps the scriptural record and theaccumulating geological record could, after all, be reconciled. Many booksappeared on this theme during the first thirty years of the nineteenth century.Three examples only need be cited here 44 . Were the ancient traditions rightafter all? Had a long-lost Golden Age been suddenly and disastrously terminatedby a frightful global Flood? The growing evidence suggested to many that thismay indeed have been the case, and efforts were redoubled to investigate thesepossibilities.The results were interesting and to some extent completely unexpected.Enigmas in Stonef^sd&ziJ&iznThe first quarter of the nineteenth century, when geological science grew apace,saw much attention given to rock striations and polished rock surfaces, and tothe vast number of boulders which, because they were usually foreign to thedistricts in which they reposed, were accordingly called 'erratics'.The rock striations were generally found to be aligned north-west to south-east,both north and south of the equator. At many places either side of the Atlanticthe striations occur only on the summits of high hills or only on the northernor north-western slopes of mountains. Locally, however, other striations crossthe predominating examples at all sorts of angles or even at right-angles totheir long axes. Such evidence suggests that whatever produced them proceededfrom a general northern or north-western direction and totally ignoredpre-existing topography.At many localities these rock striations furrow extraordinarily smooth rocksurfaces, insome instances exhibiting a glass-like polish. Such surfaces are of irregularextent, but occur with or near striated rocks so frequently that little doubtexists that the striating and polishing of these surfaces had a common origin,both in cause and time.Many of the 'erratic' boulders are of immense size and weight, the very largestbeing literally miles long 45 . In some districts they abound in almostunbelievable numbers, perch precariously in long lines along mountain crests, orlie singly upon the very summits of lofty eminences. At other places they chokevalleys and gorges or repose in splendid isolation on the surfaces of plains anddeserts. Sometimes the boulders are visible in their entirety - elsewhere theyare buried almost out of sight by surrounding surface deposits. 'Erratics' areoften reported as sharply angular and \"fresh-looking\" 46 , rounded and polished,or as sometimes scored by \"well-marked parallel striae\" 47 , andTable 1AGeological Eras, Periods and EpochsGeological Eras and PeriodsThe sequence of eras and periods which comprise Earth history, with theirestimated durations given in parentheses. Not to scale.The Tertiary and Quaternary PeriodsThe conventional subdivisions of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods with theirestimated durations shown in parentheses. Not to scale.in every case as having travelled considerable distances to their presentlocations -their points of origin often remaining obscure. Their angular and\"fresh-looking\" condition, however, suggests that their transportation was rapidand of short duration, a startling conclusion respecting the largest 'erratics'.Like the rock striations mentioned above, these boulders were evidentlydispersed by an agency operating oblivious to older geographical barriers andsometimes obliquely to the long axes of pre-existing ground features 48 .Repeating associations of polished rock surfaces, striations and erratics areknown from many widely-sundered localities, such as Montana 49 , Brazil 50 , andFinland 51 . Clearly these phenomena are different expressions of a singularevent which occurred on a hemispheric scale.The superficial sands and gravels which contain the bony remains of woollyrhinoceroses, mammoths and other large contemporary mammals, also lie unusuallyto adjacent local topographical features. They are often banked up againstnorthern or north-western mountain or valley slopes only. At other places theymantle only the summits of high mountains, sometimes to depths of severalthousand feet or metres. Elsewhere they bury the lower flanks of whole mountainranges or even fill up entire valleys. They also frequently contain largequantities of geologically recent plant remains, at some places so profuselythat, in company with coeval (same age) animal bones, they completely fill cavesand rock fissures. Yet, even in such apparently chaotic evidence a curiouslyconsistent theme emerges, for at many sites - thosearound Muggendorf in Germany for instance 52 - only the caves and fissuresfacing northwards or north-westwards have been so filled.Almost all early geologists attributed these clearly linked phenomena to theaction of powerful water currents flowing in a general north-to-south direction.The first scientific explanations purporting to account for these phenomenaincluded vast river floods, 'waves of translation' generated by hypotheticalgiant submarine earthquakes, and the equator-wards drift of huge numbers of siltand stone-laden icebergs of northern origin, which deposited their stony cargoesin warmer latitudes. These explanations invoked essentially catastrophic causes,and the irregular character of the relevant deposits, due to their supposedtransportation by water or ice from one place to another, were soon widelyreferred to as 'drift'. In turn, the advocates of such explanations were groupedwith those who, like Whiston, had long postulated recurrent violent episodes inEarth history, and were regarded as 'Catastrophists'.For many older naturalists the 'drift' deposits and the pulverised and fissuredbedrock upon which it frequently rested represented the stony remnants of aformer but now badly scarred world, destroyed by an agency which, in thegeological scale of things, had operated remarkably recently. Recognising themodernity of this material, present geologists assign most of it to thePleistocene period which, ending approximately 11,000 years ago, immediatelypreceded the Holocene (our own) period (see table 1A).World Ages - World Suns«TS^4»s,;v!j<£sr-»One of classical Greece's most celebrated philosophers, Plato, citing even olderEgyptian records, stated that in addition to world disasters resulting fromfire, there had been not one but many great floods which had terminated severalearlier successive ages\". The pre-Columbian Mexicans possessed generally similarbeliefs in which various past ages, which they referred to as 'suns', werebrought to violent ends by tremendous natural upheavals, floods, furious windsand rampant fire 54 . Numerous other Amerindian recollections, particularlythose from western North America, mention 'ages' as 'suns', the number of whichvaries from three to five in different accounts 55 , and traditionally attributetheir ends to a disastrous \"falling of the sky\". As the mythographer Alexanderremarked:The notion of cataclysmic destructions of the world by flood or fire, often witha concomitant falling of the sky is frequent in West Coast myth... 56Even the remote tribes of the Amazon basin possess these beliefs, many of whichembody the idea of terrible disasters involving fire and prolonged darkness and,above all, an immense world-drowning flood analogous to that mentioned inGenesis 57 .On the other side of the world, the Dusan tribe of western Borneo (Kalimantan)preserve a similar idea which they link to seven 'suns' thus:The sky, originally low, retreated when six of the original seven suns werekilled. 58We shall meet these seven suns again later. A belief in recurrent worlddisasters terminating successive earlier ages wasformerly extremely widespread, both in time and geographically. The Voguls ofSiberia, for instance, believed in recurrent conflagrations attended by fearfulthunder 5 \"; the Welsh Triads, compiled from more ancient sources during themiddle ages, refer to three great cataclysms, one involving a deluge, another afire and a third a drought 6 \"; in the 6th century BC both Anaximenes andAnaximander assumed periodic world destruction with subsequent re-creation, asdid Diogenes of Apollonia in the 5th century BC; Aristarchus, who flourished atSamos in the 3rd century BC, taught that the Earth undergoes destruction by fireand water every 2,484 years 61 . The Chinese entertained similar ideas 62 , asdid nations as far apart as Hawaii 63 , the shores of the Bengal Sea 64 , theearly Icelanders 65 , and the Jews 66 . The ancient sacred book of theBuddhists, the Visuddhi-Magga, mentions a still more ancient work calledDiscourse on the Seven Suns b? , indicating that the same notion had longexisted on the Indian subcontinent, while in Mexico, the old Mayan Annals ofCuauhtitlan, written about AD 1570 on the basis of still earlier sources,mentions seven 'sun' epochs known as the Chicon-Tonatiuh 68 .Many early memories of these world-shaking events specifically link them withthe abrupt destruction of a primeval earthly paradise widely known to classicalwriters as a Golden Age. The Roman writer Ovid stated that during the reign ofthe legendary king Kronos (Saturn of the Romans, and the alleged ancestor of theOlympian gods of both ancient Greece and Rome) springtime was perennial 6 \".Virtually every commentator of antiquity on this topic agreed that this lost agewas a golden one and the Earth a veritable paradise. It was, as Lenormant oncenoted, traceable...among all people of the Aryan or Japhetic race. 70Ver perpetuum, or perpetual spring, was its alleged climate 71 . Variousremarkable and often quite unbelievable characteristics were attributed to it,such as it being a place \"...where the human inhabitants are in the prime oflife, with no aging or senility\" 72 .The early Egyptians preserved similar memories, for:In Egyptian mythology, the reign of Ra was like the primeval reign of Kronos;the myth of it was a reminiscence of the sinless Golden Age. 73Classical writers like Strabo and Pherecydes discussed the location of the seatof Kronos' empire, and concluded that it was a northern one:Pherecydes described Kronos as dwelling in that part of heaven 'nearest theearth', ie, the North; Strabo places him in the 'home of Boreas'. These allagree in essence with Sanchoniathon, as preserved in the Greek version by Philoof Byblos, who said that the seat of Kronos' power was 'in the middle of thelands... in a place near springs and rivers'. 74Most mythographers agree that Boreas, in whose home Kronos dwelt, equates withthe Norse Bor, known to the ancient Greeks as the demiurge Ophion, who, undervarious guises, lies at the very root of most of the world's mythologies. Thus,in the Norse epics, it is the sons of Bor who build Asgard, the abode of thegods and their kin, from which they reputedly wrought many wondrous deeds bothon Earth and in the heavens 75 . Odin, the principal Norse deity, lived there,as did his Finnish counterpart Ukko, who resided at Tatela or the Place of Tahti76 . Very interestingly, Taht in the Estonian language means 'Pole Star' - so,again, we are directed to a northern location for this ancient paradise.Early Greek authors like Apollodorus and Theopompus expressly called thistraditionallost land Meropia and its inhabitants the Meropes. The latter were sometimesanciently identified with the Hyperboreans, a near-mythical people alleged tohave dwelt either in the extreme west or in the far north. Dominating all was alofty mountain named Meru. Meru also features in ancient Indian epic literature,not so much as a particular peak but as a generally elevated region 77 . It wasevidently the centre from which a long-forgotten empire was ruled, for we findthat Deva-Nahusha, one of the Vedic deities of old India and whose greatness wasextolled in glowing terms, for a time had:...sovereign control of the affairs of Mem... he led his armies through all...the world; by means of matchless wisdom and miraculous heroism he made hisempire universal 78 .Ancient Chinese traditions likewise speak of a highly elevated region whereindwelt gods and other wonderful personages. The principal Chinese deity,Lao-T'ien-Yeh, known as the 'Heavenly Master of the First Origin', and creditedwith creating the first humans, reputedly lived with his consort, Queen Wang -who reappears in the ancient Chinese romance of the Emperor of Mu - in theK'un-Lun mountains 79 . Variant Chinese traditions refer to the supreme deity asShafig-Te, whose palace was located in a \"celestial space about the North Pole\"80 . Likewise the western Mongolians placed the abode of their gods on a 'GoldenMountain', the apex of which they considered identical with the celestial Pole81 . Presumably for these reasons the Japanese, who held essentially similarbeliefs, addressed their principal god as the 'Lord of the Centre of Heaven' 82.Probably the best known of all recollections of this idyllic land (shared byMoslem, Jew, and Christian alike) is the 'Garden of Eden'. Unmistakable variantsof it occur in early Persian, Arabian and Sanskrit (Indian) literature; it ismentioned as Atlan by the Aztecs and as Xibalba by the Quiche Maya of Yucatan.The Polynesians remember it as the 'lost home of Kane', and Plato apparentlyleft us a comparatively detailed account of it in his description of thelegendary sunkenisland of Atlantis 83 , although suspicion exists that much of his version issomewhat idealised.Several widely-scattered traditions describe the catastrophic termination ofthis wonderful primordial age. The inception of terrible unaccustomed cold was aspecial feature of that event. Thus Iranian tradition asserts:The first of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created wasAiryana Vaejo (Iran the Ancient)... There are ten winter months there (now), twosummer months, and these are cold for the waters, cold for the earth and coldfor the trees 84 .cradle of mankind have been ably reviewed by Pietremont 85 who, among otherthings, mentioned Lactantius's assertion that prolonged darkness accompanied adreadful winter at the time 86 , and that the Delaware Indians remember closelysimilar details in their account of the event 87 . This icy calamity was almostcertainly identical with the appalling Fimbul winter of Norse mythology, ofwhich more anon.Also remembered among the cataclysmic agencies which destroyed this primeval agewas a gigantic destructive flood, in which:...trees, flowers, fruits, birds, vanished in an instant, amid terrific clamour.88Other traditions about a disastrous refrigeration of the former abode of thegods and theThe significance of these memories will become all too clear as this bookunfolds.A Displaced Axis?t^i^fe-i^jiisr-iVery interestingly, life-forms like those just listed arebiologically-compatible organisms inasmuch as, despite its traditional northernor polar location, the paradisical Eden, Asgard, Meru or Airyana Vaejo enjoyed aperennial spring-like climate. As shown later, these details are supported by agreat deal of factual evidence.It is also clear that the loss of this ancestral paradise involved arearrangement of the seasons. Indeed, describing the \"World Before the Present\",the Navajo Indians of North America insist that:...The seasons were much shorter than they are now. A year then was but a monthof our time. 89The statement contained in Zad Sparan's paraphrase of chapters 1 - 5 of thePersianBundahish texts agrees with the above in describing how, when Airyana Vaejo waslost, the whole sky and sea became deranged -and lends support to FrederickKlee's contention that certain ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs refer to adisplacement of the heavens at the time of the Deluge\" 11 . We have just notedthat a tremendous flood was allegedly one of the features of the end of theidyllic primeval age said to have preceded our own. The above, and other similarrecollections of a celestial derangement accompanying the Deluge indicate thatbefore the onset of that calamity the celestial bodies moved differentlyrelative to viewers on Earth. The illustrious Greek astronomer Anaxagoras taughtthat during the Golden Age the stars revolved in a tholiform manner (when starsrevolve in the sky in a horizontal plane), a belief shared by another Greekastronomer, Anaximenes,who, however, preferred to say that the stars revolved in a horizontal plane.Diogenes Laertius, who recorded these opinions, added:At first the Pole Star, which is continually visible, always appeared in thezenith, but afterwards it acquired a certain declination. 1 \".Ancient Japanese cosmogony (theory of the origin of the universe) refers tovirtually the same condition, thus:...the father of our present sun and moon is represented as beginning hisactivities in the newly-created world by repeatedly performing in a horizontalplane... Chinese traditions also refer to this. 92Additional confirmation of this earlier celestial arrangement (and of some lateralteration to it) was given by the respected Victorian astronomer RichardProctor, who concluded that, from the position of the aquatic constellations(given watery associations) in the most ancient astronomical systems, celestialrotation at the time of their invention must have been \"...in a horizontalposition\" 93 .* The date when these constellations were first devised is stillunknown, but all authorities agree that it must have been a remotely ancientone. Certainly by 5100 BC alpha (a) Ursae Majoris or Dublie in the constellationof the Great Bear (Ursa Major) had already long been viewed as a polar star, forit appears engraved upon the walls of the temple of Hathor at Denderah in Egypt,and formed the original orientation-point of that structure 94 . At that datethe stars of the constellation of the Dragon (Draco) were circum-polar. It wasnot until 2000 BC that the stars of Ursa Major - now the principal constellationin the northern sky - became circumpo-lar too 95 .In this connection it is significant that for latitudes below 51°N today, thestars of Ursa Major 'set' and 'rise', and that at the latitude of the oldEgyptian capital Memphis only Dubhe always remains above the horizon by some 5°.Nonetheless, within historical times* See Note!.Ursa Major was wholly invisible to residents of the Nile Valley south of Memphis9 \" yet the ancient Egyptians knew that the polar axis lay in that constellationduring historical times 97 . That they should have been aware of this is not,however, so very surprising when we recall that one of their leading historians,Manetho, asserted that his race possessed records of events dating back as faras 11,542 BC, or, as previously noted, Apollonius thought that by his day153,075 years of history had passed by.These formerly different positions of the above-mentioned constellationsactually relate to the well-known astronomical phenomenon of the precession ofthe celestial North Pole which is, of course, matched by an equivalent effect atthe celestial South Pole. Concerning these, Sir James Jeans once remarked:...our ancestors of 5,000 years ago saw the heavens turning round a point in theconstellation of the Dragon. For the same reasons, our posterity of 5,000 yearshence will see the heavens turning round a point in the constellation ofCepheus. 98Recent research, however, suggests that something more profound than just acelestial precession has occurred. The precession itself is merely an effect ofa more fundamental change.Studies have shown that at 10,178 BC, or over 12,000 years ago, the celestialpole was inclined at an angle of 30° from its present position 99 . This in turnstrongly suggests that the terrestrial axis was then oriented differently fromtoday. If true, that imparts an entirely new significance to the afore-citedstatements of Anaxagoras, Anaximenes, Diogenes Laertius and Proctor, and theassertions of the previously mentioned traditions. It also suggests that at thetime of the Deluge which allegedly terminated the Golden Age there must havebeen a change to the tilt of the Earth's axis.Any axial changes of the type just suggested would, of course, have beenattended by various other major natural adjustments on quite literally a globalbasis. There are nowCassiopeiapicture1 [images/picture1.jpg]Ursa MajorFig 1.1. Precession of the Polar Axis. After Sir James Jeans.plenty of these on record from different parts of the world, clustered aroundthe date of 10,178 BC, calculated as that when Earth's celestial pole lay at anangle of 30° from its present position.According to standard Ice Age chronology (see table 1A), the final icy episodeof any magnitude was the so-called Younger Dryas which brought the Pleistoceneepoch to a close. This occurred between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago when thewaters of the North Atlantic warmed by as much as 7°C within a mere 50 years 100, and ended a period of cold dry conditions on Greenland, slightly later at10,700 years, in as little as 20 years -an estimate lately reduced to an\"astonishingly quick 3-5 years\" 101 - concomitantly with a rapid retreat ofsea-ice in northern waters and a 50% increase in precipitation and snowfall 102.Recently obtained ice-cores from Greenland reveal even quicker changes. Snowfallthere, for example, \"doubled rapidly... possibly in one to three years\" at theclose of Younger Dryas times in response \"...to somekind of threshold or trigger in the North Atlantic climatic system\" 103 . Theeffects of these climate changes, described by some recent investigators asbrief and dramatic, were felt all round the North Atlantic basin 104 , inAlaska, where they took place between 11,000 and 10,000 years ago 105 , and, asin Europe 106 , involved marked vegetational changes 107 .Essentially comparable changes also occurred then about the same time much moredistantly. Space limitations here preclude the recitation of many details,although we may highlight those from Tibet and China, where climate changesseriously affected Tibetan lake levels and led to long-term aridity across muchof the Tibetan plateau, a process commencing \"suddenly\" about 10,000 years ago108 , and where Chinese climatic conditions and plant life were enormouslyaffected by a northerly displacement of a greatly enhanced monsoonal systemwhich did not occupy its present, more southerly, sphere of operations untilabout 6,000 years ago 109 .All such data are indicative of seriously, and suddenly, disturbed atmosphericand oceanic circulatory systems of the kind that could be expected to naturallyattend an alteration to the angle of Earth's axis -assuming that such a changeis possible or actually occurred in the geologically recentpast. As later pages show, such a change almost certainly did occur, and, notunexpectedly, involved many other factors in addition to those just mentioned.Before we can consider these, however, it will be necessary to review somefurther aspects of the general scenario which has unfolded so far.6 The Paradoxs-^x$>t&ii£&sr»It was precisely the kind of traditional backdrop which we have outlined onpreceding pages that, confronting the emerging discipline of geology some 170years ago, clearly indicated to the pioneer geologists that, together with'drift', 'erratic' boulders and fresh-looking land-surface phenomena, a majorphysical disturbance had afflicted Earth within geologically very recent times.This perspective remained popular until about 1830, when Charles Lyell, then ayoung lawyer, published an alternative interpretation, his celebrated'principles of uniformi-ty' no .Like Hutton before him, Lyell argued that no past geological processes radicallydiffered from those operating today. Deposits have accumulated slowly overperiods individually lasting many thousands, even millions, of years. Wind, rainand frost had inexorably denuded landscapes just as surely as oceans hadsculpted shorelines. The temporal and geographical extent of any former naturalupheavals such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions must of necessity beenbrief; they were not global events. The world-embracing cataclysms of the'Catastrophists' were ruled out; 'gradualism' was said to have been theoverriding norm. If it had occurred at all, the Deluge was considered to havebeen a relatively modest event confined to a limited geographical region. Theterm 'Pleistocene' wascoined specifically to embrace the various 'diluvial' (flood-borne) formations -the sands, gravels, muds, silts, etc - of the 'Catastrophists', and as adistinctive name for the period when these had been deposited.Lyell's views, having the special merit of giving a terrestrial rather than acosmic cause for the present panorama of a debris-strewn world, were quicklyheld to signify 'unifor-mitarianism' (as opposed to the until then popular'catastrophism') and soon came to be accorded a respect only slightly lower thanthat usually reserved for Holy Writ.Thus, supporters of Lyell's ideas became known as 'Uniformitarians', and'uniformi-tarianism' became a pillar of conventional geological dogma. How theacceptance of 'uniformitarianism' soon afterwards led to the formulation of theGlacial Theory and the idea of an Ice Age will be presented shortly.In one geological camp we thus have 'Catastrophists' who have long sought to usescientific data to prove the former reality of terrible world disasters -particularly the Deluge of global recollection. They have emphasised thatnumerous Deluge traditions mention one or more celestial agents as havingassailed Earth and having caused that watery calamity, and that prolificevidence capable of being reasonably interpreted as having originated in justsuch circumstances is available for study. In effect their argumentis essentially identical to that presently urged by the proponents of therecently advanced theory of an asteroidal or cometary termination of theMesozoic Era during late Cretaceous times.In the opposite camp, 'Uniformitarians' have argued that, despite the evidenceof the frozen Siberian carcasses (apparent examples of a catastrophic eventwhich we consider again in greater detail later), recurrent disasters of suchmagnitude are completely at variance with the normal workings of Nature onEarth. They discern no terrestrial mechanism capable of generating of its ownvolition a cataclysm as allegedly gigantic as the Deluge, despite the fact thatleading Catastrophists like Whiston 111 , Donnelly 112 , Beaumont 113 , Patten114 and others specifically invoked external (cosmic) causes for that calamity.Since 'uniformitarians' perceive or admit of no physical proof of a conflictbetween this planet and some other celestial agent, they regard as spurious allclaims advocating such an idea. Furthermore, they contend that the factual dataregularly used to support 'catastrophist' arguments relates mostly to thewidespread action of ice, not water.It is, therefore, paradoxical that a worldwide traditional memory of anappalling watery disaster during the infancy of mankind, involving one or morecosmic visitors, has persisted from earliest historical times. Further, thatscience, having assembled a veritable library of facts dealing with the verysame period, interprets the same evidence as due to quite another cause. The'catastrophist' and 'uniformitarian' schools of thought are thus apparentlydiametrically opposed.As we now shall see, this is not necessarily the case at all.Perspectives - a Question of Scalef-^Sd&iOS^r*In actuality 'uniformitarianism' is 'cata-strophism', but on an insignificantand hugely broadened-out scale. There is no hard dividing line separating thetwo extremes represented by these terms. The word 'scale', however, is the keyto this whole scenario: it permits the development of accurate perspectives.Such perspectives, however, are scarcely attainable if the apparentlydiametrically opposed concepts of 'uniformitarianism' and 'catastrophism' arerigorously compartmentalised and continue to be regarded as incompatible.Dictionaries define the word 'scale' as the ratio between given sizes orintensities of events and things (both animate and inanimate), and denotesrelative magnitude. Compared to an ant, for example, a humanbeing is a very large entity, and the ant is enormous compared to a microbe. Thesame human being is quite small alongside the largest tree or whale, and isalmost insignificant compared to a mountain or an ocean. Even the mightiestmountain is no more than a pimple on Earth's crust, and any one of the oceansbut a puddle on the planet's uneven surface. Yet even the largest mountain isdwarfed by the smallest ocean.Although colossal by human standards, Earth itself is a rather modestly-sizedplanet and, as with all the other planets forming the solar system, is a verysmall object relative to the Sun around which it orbits. Viewed astronomically,however, the Sun and the solar system is almost invisibly tiny compared to theimmensity of the galaxy (toearthbound observers best known as the Milky Way) of which it is a member. Theunimaginably vast distances separating the Sun from its orbiting planets, theplanets from each other, and the solar system generally from the nearest stars,immediately put into clear spatial perspectives the great event discussed inthis book.Nature itself operates essentially as a series of disasters. These, relative tothe organisms and environmental conditions involved at any given moment of time,are no less catastrophic than the frightful disaster described on followingpages. For example, natural marine and river erosion constantly destroy throughundercutting, stream banks and coastal cliffs. For organisms inhabiting suchplaces, such physical alterations are frequently lethal and at best decimatory.Again, unseasonably wet weather can rot seeds, fruits and flowers before theycan germinate or pollinate successfully. Similarly, prolonged drought canshrivel vegetation or generate fires every bit as calamitous as high winds canremove blossom before it can 'set', or cause chronic 'wind-burn' to plants atvital youthful stages of their development - in the process stultifying harvestsand crops. Moreover, particular combinations of climatic factors can and oftendo encourage abnormal increases in insect and rodent populations preparatory toinsect and vermin plagues.Viewed locally, and irrespective of whether they occur suddenly, violently orintensely, or operate slowly over many weeks or months (such as the 'Dutch ElmDisease' episode of the 1970s), all these and many other analogous events arecatastrophic. They are apparently the underlying cause for the 'survival of thefittest' as defined by Darwin and other evolutionists.When such episodes are small-scale, or fail to affect human beingssignificantly, they either pass unnoticed or are generally regarded by irritatedfarmers, meteorologists and naturalists as normal quirks of Nature. Yet, despiterepresenting miniature catastrophes, they continue to be regarded as naturalexpressions of 'uniformitarianism'.If such events manifest as landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakesortsunamis'^ and happen suddenly, violently or with great intensity, or when theyoccasion appreciable loss of property or 'valued' life (ie people, ownedlivestock, etc), they are noticed and bracketed as cataclysms, and the regionsthey worst affect as 'disaster areas'. It seems to be commonly accepted thatsuch events naturally but sporadically punctuate the uniformitarian norm (asdefined by Lyellian dogma), which thus extends to include even such dreadfulevents as the Krakatau explosion of 1883 116 .Yet none of these 'catastrophes' is individually large or intense enough toterminate a whole geological era or period, or to usher in a new one along thelines postulated by many past 'catastrophist' authors.Compartmentalisation of traumas like those outlined above, though perhapsconvenient for insurance purposes, is demonstrably unstable scientifically.'Natural disasters' like those just enumerated are relatively no more and noless 'natural' or 'disastrous' than the aforementioned and comparativelyinnocuous cliff falls, plagues and crop failures. The only difference separatingall these events is the intensity and extent of their occurrence. Thisdifference is purely one of scale.Thus, as long as portions of the Earth's crust do not collapse or get up-heavedinto mountain ranges, and oceans are not displaced or drained, man seems contentto treat all lesser disasters as normal expressions of 'uniformitarianism' -which, of course, they are. Nevertheless, he is quick to categorise anythinglarger or more severe, such as terrestrial convulsions induced by, say,celestial agencies (which at present we can merely envisage theoretically), aspure 'cata-strophism', and places it outside 'uniformitarianism' as we usuallyconceive it.Astronomers and astrophysicists, familiar with the near-endless succession ofparoxysmal events occurring naturally throughout the universe during the birth,evolution and demise of galaxies, stars and sundry other cosmic bodies, concedethat such events are part of the astronomical norm. As such, despite theirinherent catastrophic character, they represent 'astronomicaluniformitarianism'.Again, the question of scale is once more the overriding factor here.When, as established by modern astronomical research, cosmic events likesuper-novae explosions occur comparatively close to the solar system, we arestill dealing with 'astronomical uniformitarianism'. Though fortunatelyinfrequent in our sector of the galaxy, it is inevitable that such events willoccur sooner or later in the vicinity of the solar system and, in the largerscheme of things, must actually be expected to do so. Thus, because Earth is acelestial body, it would, in the event of an encounter with some intrusivecelestial object, react according to natural planetary 'laws' which, as we havejust indicated, must themselves be a part of 'uniformitarianism' in its widest(cosmic) sense.It is only when an event of that kind occurs, however, that these more violentaspects of 'uniformitarianism' can manifest themselves on Earth, for they do notand cannot arise of their own volition without external (cosmic) stimuli. Thus,if appropriate circumstances were to occur, the operation of such 'laws' on awatery planet like Earth could, among other things, be expected to cause oceanicdisplacement on a scale which might well approach the traditional proportions ofthe Deluge. Such disturbances would be lethal for all preexisting topography andbiota, and would rapidly result in the development of conditions where thedoctrine of 'survival of the fittest' - so typical of Lyellian'uniformitarianism' - would be supplanted by that of 'survival of the luckiest'.That, most interestingly, is exactly what so many Deluge traditions around theworld expressly state.Cosmically induced upheavals like these not only differ from conventionaluniformi-tarian disturbances by their enormously greater magnitude, violence andintensity, but from the fact that, in one form or another, they perforceencompass practically the entire globe 117 . However one wants to regard thecollective testimony of the world's Flood traditions, there is no escaping itsalmost monotonously recurrent assertion that the Deluge was a worldwide event -precisely what a catastrophe generated by cosmic agencies could be expected toinduce. In that connection it is hardly necessary to stress that thejuxtaposition in numerous traditions of huge terrestrial convulsions and certaincelestial bodies at the very time of the Deluge can scarcely be a coincidence orthe happy product of traditional imagination.The reality is, of course, 'uniformitarianism' and 'catastrophism' are merelyopposite extremes of an essentially ongoing chain of essentially calamitousnatural episodes spanning the observable universe and ranging, as far as wehumans are concerned, from the almost-insignificant to the virtuallyworld-shattering. Once this problem of scale is overcome psychologically,comprehension of what follows in this book should grow progressively clearer.To what extent, then, are the perspectives of the 'catastrophists' and the'uniformitari-ans' actually correct? Are the former woefully wrong and thelatter right, or is the reverse true? Could the arguments and contentions ofboth schools of thought be simultaneously partially valid and partiallyerroneous? Is there, in fact, any possibility at all of effectively reconcilingsuch basically different points of view? Believing that there is, we devote theremainder of this book to resolving this seemingly intractable problem.The Birth of the Glacial TheoryS-^SO&iiJf&zZ-iOne of the most puzzling facts of Nature confronting late eighteenth and earlynineteenth century scholars was the occurrence of the aforementioned frozenanimal carcasses of Siberia. Not surprisingly, several earlier authorities,including Pallas 118 , Cuvier 119 , Erman 120 and D'Archiac 121 , who subscribedto the (catastrophist) Diluvial Theory, concluded that a colossal mass of movingwater had overwhelmed those creatures.It was, and still is, widely contended that the preserved hairy coats of thesefrozen animals served as natural protection against severe cold, and that theirowners were former denizens of Arctic latitudes now hosting their remains. Thisview is still often reflected in artists' reconstructions of these bygonemammals. As modern researches have shown, however, such conclusions haveproved to be no more than assumptions (see appendix A) and, as we shall see inPart Five, most of the animals now found as frozen carcasses were corpses beforethey were refrigerated.Nevertheless, it was the coupling of these assumptions with Lyell's then new andsuperficially attractive theory of 'uniformity' that led early nineteenthcentury geologists to reconsider the origin of polished and striated rocks, thesingular distribution of 'erratic' boulders and the conditions under which theimmense 'drift' deposits had accumulated. All these had clearly been produced byan agency or process evidently operating contemporaneously with thedeep-freezing of animals in northern Siberia. If, it was reasoned, these latterwere animals specially equipped to withstand great cold - as must also have beenthe same species knownpicture2 [images/picture2.jpg]J*&g**z. ^.-r 06 ^Left: Fig 1.2a. The Hairy Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). After Erwin CChristman.Right: Fig 1.2b. The Woolly Rhinoceros (Coelodonta ticfwrhinus). After Erwin CChristman.picture3 [images/picture3.jpg]21picture4 [images/picture4.jpg]22further south only from unfrozen bones -then had not all this vast corpus ofassociated phenomena - in particular the striated and polished rocks - resultedfrom intense and widespread glaciation? Such glaciation, though now largelymelted everywhere except in Arctic Siberia, had a priori affected allterritories yielding remains of animals assumed to have been adaptedbiologically to icy conditions.Put another way, did not the occurrence in 'drift' deposits of unfrozen remainsof animals identical to those represented by the Siberian carcasses prove thatice had formerly covered all the regions where such remains are now found? Wouldnot the one-time presence of ice across all these regions reconcile the apparentanomalies of the fossil record?It was decided, therefore, that in the not-so-distant geological past - a factoremphasised by the remarkable freshness and scarcely-fossilised condition of thebones of the 'drift' animals - huge areas of the northern hemisphere must eitherhave been swathed in ice or had experienced temperatures considerably lower thanthey do today.In 1821, the Swiss engineer Ignaz Venetz drew attention to evidence he took tobe former Alpine glaciation on a huge scale 122 . Shortly afterwards theNorwegian geologist Jens Esmarch similarly advocated far greater landwardextensions of the Norwegian glaciers and, by 1832, Prof A Bernhardi had proposedthat the North Polar ice had once extended to the southernmost edge of theGerman plain now dotted with 'erratics'. Just two years later, Johann vonCharpentier noted the existence of deep grooves and scratches on many Alpinerock surfaces and boulders and, like a colleague, Karl Schimper, concluded thatthey were the work of ice and that a veritable Ice Age characterised by numerouslarge glaciers descending hills and mountains everywhere in central Europe hadonce been a reality. By virtue of their natural slow movements, glaciers, ofcourse, admirably epitomised Lyell's then recently-published theory ofuniformity and gradualism.Thus, with their constant and remorseless movement, active glaciers (as distinctfromthose in retreat) were thought to be capable of providing the continuous powernecessary to move huge boulders, striate and polish rock surfaces, and deepen orwiden older valleys. The stony material excavated by the ice would be carriedslowly down to the terminal ends of the glaciers in the normal way and theredeposited as moraines (piles of deposited debris) analogous to those stillformed by many present glaciers. Earlier investigators professedly saw morainicdebris in the many heaps and banks of stones and gravel traceable all overwestern and central Europe, and the notion soon arose that all these had oncebeen deposited by now vanished glaciers.By 1836, when the Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz of Motiers joined Charpentierin his Alpine studies, many ears receptive to the idea of former extensiveglaciation already existed in Europe, and a report submitted by Agassiz to theAnnual Congress of Swiss Scientists in the July of that year was accordinglywell received. Agassiz's report proposed that a profound fall in temperature hadoccurred previous to the upheaval of the Alps and that tremendous masses of icehad smothered land surfaces as far distant as 'erratics' and striated rocks arenow distributed. Agassiz expanded his ideas in a larger work published in 1840123 and it established him as the inventor of the Ice Age, even though, as notedabove, Charpentier and Schimper had independently proposed just such an 'age'several years earlier.After disposing of all previous alternative hypotheses, Agassiz argued thatrepeated falls of temperature had occurred before the Alpine upheaval and thatan immense ice-sheet or mer de glace had covered the greater part of northernand western Europe, much of the western end of the Mediterranean as far south asthe Atlas Mountains of North Africa, and that a similar glacial mantle hadblanketed north-western Asia and much of North America. Only the highest summitsprotruded above Agassiz's alleged glacial 'sea', principally because theirjagged and angular profiles were obviously never rounded or smoothed by ice.Agassiz then envisaged an Alpine rise, an increase intemperature and a melting away of the ice-sheet.He failed to explain why there had been a lowering of temperature in the firstplace, merely alluding vaguely to some sort of cli-matological change. That, iftrue, was, like the ice, no more than an effect of some other cause - a circularargument if ever there was one! It apparently never occurred to Agassiz, nor hismany supporters, that such a change must have been occasioned by something evenmore radical than the immense ice accumulations he postulated. Nevertheless,once formed, the ice itself must also have engendered a lowering of temperatureacross the regions it allegedly covered.Despite these shortcomings, Agassiz's hypothesis won rapid acceptance ingeological circles - one suspects because, to at least some degree, it followedso closely upon the heels of Lyell's by then fashionable and beguilingly logicaltheory of uniformity. Indeed, it was soon widely held that huge slow-movingglaciers and ice-sheets were sufficient to account for all observable 'drift'phenomena. That extensive, enormously thick, ice-sheets formerly lay across vasttracts of the northern hemisphere during Pleistocene times began to be acceptedas having actually occurred. Theory was beginning to be converted into fact.As scholars pondered the implications of Agassiz's theory it became apparentthat as the ice-sheets could not have moved of their own accord, and allegedlyburied all but the very highest peaks of known mountain systems in the regionsthey supposedly blanketed, still higher ground had to exist somewhere within theice's sphere of advocated operations to supply the impetus to propel themequatorwards. To overcome that problem it was speculated that crustaldislocations resulting in the up-rise of a range of very high mountains hadtaken place in the far north, at or near the present North Pole. The steepgradients occasioned by the range's great altitude allegedly provided theconditions necessary to push accumulating ice downwards and outwards to thedistant margins of the ice-sheets. Later, it was argued, these mountainssubsided and theice, no longer replenished and deprived of motion, melted away.The scenario just outlined was, of course, not only conjectural but completelyfalse. Science has never found any trace of the imaginary northern mountainrange. In retrospect it is astonishing that this unscientific explanation evercame to be formulated, yet in a short time both it and the concept of immensethick ice-sheets descending from a hypothetical northern mountain system, tocover all of northern and eastern North America and western and northernEurasia, was enthusiastically embraced and came to be regarded as virtuallyestablished fact. After all, it was argued, did not the slow but irresistiblepower of enormously thick moving ice ideally explain the observed distributionof the 'erratics', striae and the 'drift' deposits? Such views, albeit somewhatmodified, still persist today.And then an interesting development occurred.Over a decade later, the Scottish geologist Andrew Ramsay completed studieswhich suggested that the Pleistocene epoch had hosted two glacial ages. Soonafterwards, Oswald Heer, investigating the Pleistocene flora of Switzerland,discovered 'interglacial' deposits containing remains of warm-temperate plantsand animals. Independent confirmation of two or more apparently warmerinterglacial episodes was also afforded about that time by German evidence.Then, in 1875, Otto Torrell thought he could conclusively show that the numerousnorth German 'erratics' had been dispersed to their present locations by giantglaciers moving southwards from a central ice-sheet believed to have occupiedthe Scandinavian plateau.To confuse matters, several later geologists significantly increased the numberof supposed ice ages and interglacials (or interstadi-als as they are now oftencalled). Prof Penck, for instance, argued for three or four, Prof Geikie forfive or six, and Dr Croll for seven. Various later writers have suggested evenhigher numbers. In contrast, at least two leading American authorities, Wrightand Upham, maintained that there was really only one ice age of considerableduration which, periodically expanding and contract-ing, gave the impression of alternating glacial and interglacial episodes. Oceanlevels are also said to have fluctuated appropriately during this alleged cycleof events.Inevitably, the length of the Pleistocene epoch hosting these events increasedevery time writers multiplied the number of separate glacial and interglacialepisodes. Thus, initially of modest duration, it steadily lengthened to one ortwo or more million years. En route to arriving at that situation, all kinds ofestimates of the durations of the supposed glacial and interglacial cycles wereproposed, discussed and, as often as not, discarded. Precise agreement wasalmost never reached. More recently, the great lengths previously advocated forthe formation and for the waning of these episodes have begun to be queried, andin some cases drastically reduced on the basis of new evidence.* Although thisaspect of the Ice Age will be examined more fully later, we may neverthelessrecall noting earlier that the growth and decay of some of these glacial andinterglacial phases proceeded with remarkablerapidity 124 - quite unlike the process imagined by Agassiz, Penck, Geikie andmost earlier glacialists, and quite at variance with the gradualism enshrined inLyell's famous theory of uniformity.Thus, through an uneasy mixture of field discoveries, inferences andpresumptions, was born the concept of an Ice Age occupying an ever-lengtheningPleistocene period. By now, of course, it will be evident that the whole edificeof the Ice Age of orthodoxy rests upon very shaky ground. That is not to assertthat the Ice Age did not exist, but does indicate that it occurred in a form andby a means not properly accommodated by conventional dogma. Moreover, a seriouserror down the years has been the general acceptance by most older (and manypresent) glaciologists that the Ice Age, whatever its origin, character andduration, developed and ran its course in a world topographically similar tothat of today. As we shall now see, that too was a fallacy, and that theimplications of that conclusion are huge and very far reaching.Upheaval*Ts^fe-}*j£«r\"»There is absolutely no doubt that the stupendous natural forces connected withmountain-building (orogeny) are closely related to large-scale deformation ofthe Earth's crust, and that many of the world's highest ranges originated in andeven attained their present elevations during crustal disturbances thatsignalled the end of Pleistocene times. That is not to imply that the Alps orHimalayas, for instance, attained their present form at a single catastrophicstroke, for reliable evidence indicates that the original up-thrust of these andother ranges first began millions of years earlier, in some cases as far* See Note 2.back as the Mesozoic Era (see table 1A). Varying amounts of increasing elevationoccurred sporadically down to the close of the Pleistocene. We do urge, however,that a high percentage of today's major ranges rose to their present heightsonly at the end of, or after, Pleistocene times. By general consensus ofopinion, that event occurred about 11,000 years before the present (see PartFive). Before then, as demonstrated by numerous geological facts andobservations, mountains were mostly of very modest elevation. Evidencesupporting that contention is both widespread and convincing.The geological modernity of folded mountains in many parts of Asia wasrecognised early this century by Dr Bailey Willis when he wrote how they\"challenge credulity by their extreme youth\" 125 . His conclusions wereconfirmed by studies of mountain ranges in China, where huge uplifts of theEarth's crust were found to have occurred since the glacial period 126 . Similaryouthful-ness characterises the ranges bordering the western Gobi desert,including all those from the Russian Altai mountains to the Tien Shan range 127. Indeed, it has been said of this region that:The present Gobi basin is relatively young, and was formed coincidentally withthe uplift of the Transbaikal ranges. 128Certainly within human memory a large inland sea, referred to in ancient Chineserecords as the 'Great Han Hai', occupied the Gobi basin. This apparentlyextended from the Great Khingan Shan in the east to the Tien Shan and Pamirranges in the west, a distance of some 2,000 miles (3,200km), and from north tosouth a distance of some 700 miles (1,120km). Its volume was accordinglyimmense. At the time of the sea's existence, the entire basin apparently layfrom two to three thousand feet (600 to 900m) lower than it does today, andthere is every indication that it was uplifted simultaneously not only with thePamirs and great ranges of western China but also with the Tibetan plateauimmediately to the south. The draining away of the water constituting thisinland sea must have been a truly devastating event.The same upheaval affected the mountainous region of northern China too, wherehuge lava outpourings occurred on the Great Khingan Shan 129 . Not improbablythese events were concurrent with the similarly large basaltic flows on theneighbouring Sikhote-Alin range, and with the spectacular collapse of the seafloor by many thousands of metres, along the eastern shoreline of the presentKamchatka peninsula, all the way south to the islands of Japan 130 . The BayanKara Shan range in western China was upheaved some 6,500ft (2,000m), whileMinya Konka, one of the world's highest peaks, was uplifted 3,250ft (1,000m),more or less coincidentally with the elevations of the ranges in Yunnan Provinceby at least 6,500ft (2,000m) 131 . Southwards, the Tibetan Plateau was elevatedby a still greater amount -9,750ft (3,000m). Opinions differ whether this tookplace in early 132 or late 133 Pleistocene times - but as this uplift is knownto have been coincident with the elevation of the Himalayas to their presentheight, which, according to Flint 134 and others, occurred at or just after theend of Pleistocene times, we are probably justified in ascribing a like date tothe Tibetan disturbances too.Flint linked this Himalayan uprise with the formation of other major Earthfeatures thus:Late Pleistocene uplift occurred in the Himalayan region and in the Alps, andlarge scale rifting took place in eastern Africa 133 .Among other ranges affected then were \"the Cordilleran systems in both North andSouth America, the Caucasus, and many others\" 136 . Wadia confirmed this withregard to Himalayan orogeny when he wrote:Evidence of the extreme youth of Himalayan orogeny has multiplied of recentyears. The tilting and elevation of the Pleistocene lake and river deposits ofthe Kashmir valley (Karewa series) containing fossil plants and vertebrates, toa height of 5,000-6,000ft; the dissection of river terraces containingpost-Tertiary mammalia to a depth of over 3,000ft and the over-thrusting of theolder Himalayan rocks upon Pleistocene gravel and alluvia of the plains havebeen noted by the Geological Survey of India and other observers 137 .Astonishing as it may seem, this over-thrusting of older upon newer formationswas attended by the dragging-up by more than 5,000ft (1,500m) of marine bedscontaining palaeolithic remains in Kashmir, and occurred during the age ofhumanity 138 . The Indian geologist M S Krishnan traced evi-dence for an extraordinarily massive uplift of the Pir Panjal mountains, also inKashmir, which attained an even greater elevation. He noted:The last stage of the uplift, which must have been of the order of 6,000ft, isbelieved to have occurred since the advent of early man. This upheaval has notonly elevated the Pir Panjal and folded and tilted the Karewas, but has alsoaffected the rocks of the Potwar and the Salt139range.Not only were the Himalayas and their satellite ranges affected by this giganticcrustal uplift, but so also were the Pamirs, the Hindu Kush, Karakoram andKailas ranges, the Kun-lun mountains and the Altai and Tien Shan ranges, all ofwhich rose to their present altitudes geologically very recently 140 . Afterdetailed studies of the Nanga-Parbat massif in the western Himalayas, Dr PFinster-walder concluded that its uprise was immediately post-glacial u> . Suchcrustal movements understandably affected local natural drainage, rivers thereexhibiting repeated proofs of rejuvenation due to uplifted watersheds. Thecourse of the Narbada River, which has been changed by \"late earth movements\",is a fine instance of this, while the precipitous waterfalls at Jabalpur owetheir present spectacular image to the same cause 142 .Comparably vast changes in the elevations of hills and mountains and of areorganised water pattern took place about the same time in Burma 143 andundoubtedly extended to northern Thailand, Laos and parts of Vietnam as farsouth as Malaya. Upraised beaches along the latter's coast show:...a recession of the sea and a lowering of sea level of at least 50ft... Thereis evidence that the sea level has fallen more than 300ft, in the area includingMt Ophir and Kedah Peak, since, or during, Pleistocene times. 144 (Our italics).Might not the elevation of these beaches have resulted as much from an uprise ofthe land as from a drop in sea level? Such an explana-tion would accord with Umbgrove's statement that:Should one, nevertheless, cling to the theory of submerged continents, the onlyalternative would be to assume that while vast blocks were being submerged inone area, parts of the ocean floor of almost identical size were being elevatedin others 145 .In other words, when portions of the Earth's crust sink in one place, otherportions tend to rise elsewhere in compensation.Space limitations preclude more than the most cursory references to the similarand apparently coeval evidence known from the Philippines 146 , various parts ofIndonesia 147 , the Pacific generally and Australia 148 , so suffice here toassert that much of the topography of all these regions came into being a mere11,000 years or so ago.Before that date it was markedly different.Much the same can be said of the present Alpine scenery in Europe. Not so longago, geologically speaking, they were little more than a chain of low hills 14'', but, judging from the under-cited remarks of Dr Reginald Daly of Harvard,the processes by which they acquired their present character involved a trulyappalling paroxysm of Nature.During the building of the Alps gigantic slabs of rock, thousands of feet thick,hundreds of miles long and tens of miles wide, were thrust up and then over,relatively to the rocks beneath. The direction of the relative over-thrustingmovement was from Africa towards the main mass of Europe to the north. Thevisible rocks of the northern Alps of Switzerland have thus been shovednorthwards distances in the order of 100 miles. In a sense the Alps used to beon the present site of northern Italy. 150In effect, the present Alps represent a crustal shortening of \"about 100km\" 151, which some authorities have suggested was as much as 600km 152 . This wascaused by avariety of interrelated processes including massive over-thrusting of older uponyounger strata analogous to that previously noted in the Himalayas.Over-thrusting on a grand scale is common for instance in the Jura mountains 153, while that in the Glarus mountains of east Switzerland is traceable for manymiles and is a showpiece of Alpine geology 154 . The Silbern and Glarnisch peaksare arresting examples of stratal inversion, and the Roggenstock, the Monch andthe mighty Jungfrau not less so 155 .Although various explanations of the precise modus operandi of these processeshave been proposed from time to time, their cause and development are stillimperfectly understood. Erich Haarmann advocated that the great rock masses wereforced to slide over one another by their own tremendous weight, but the roleplayed in this process by plutonic melts (layers of molten rocks formed deepwithin the Earth), such as would permit this, has yet to be clarified.Nonetheless Haarmann's hypothesis is perhaps still the most attractive of thoseavailable. Certainly the juggernaut-like progress of billions of tonnes of rockover surface strata, crushing and obliterating everything in its path is almostunimaginable.Prof Oswald Heer associated this convulsion with the \"glacial epoch\" 156 duringlate Pleistocene times. Today, the summits of three of the highest Alpine peaks,Mt Blanc, Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn, respectively stand 15,781ft (4,856m),15,217ft (4,682m) and 14,691ft (4,520m) above sea level. If we assume thedescription of the proto-Alps as \"low hills\" to signify no more than say 2,000ft(600m), the uprise involved must have been as much as 12,000-13,000ft(3,700-4,000m). A stratal uplift of this magnitude is positively staggering,while the heat generated by the physical over-thrusting and inversion of suchgigantic rocky masses must have been appalling.It is unnecessary here to review all the great mountain systems of the world. Wemay pass on to consider just a few outstanding examples from Africa and theAmericas, merely pausing en route to note that the elevation of the Norwegianmountains, withtheir fiords - of which more shortly - is thought to have been late glacial oreven post-glacial 157 .Almost certainly the orogeny just discussed was coeval with crustal dislocationsalong the north-west African coast and in the adjacent Atlas mountains. Thelatter, in particular the Anti-Atlas, formerly extended into the presentAtlantic Ocean at least as far as the Canary Islands. The subsidence of thisearlier westerly prolongation of Africa, marked by gross local distortions ofstrata, occurred in late Pleistocene or earliest Holocene times 158 .Significantly, coincidental with this subsidence, the Hoggar (Ahaggar) and Airregions of the Sahara far to the south-east were evidently in the process ofbeing abruptly upheaved 159 .Unquestionably, these elevatory and depressive crustal movements, the emptyingin some localities of lakes and inland seas and the creation and enlarging ofrivers elsewhere were intimately connected with huge tectonic disturbances ofthe kind that produced the Great Rift Valley of east Africa, a feature commonlyassigned to late glacial (Pleistocene) times 150 .These geophysical changes find almost exactly similar parallels in the Americas.Referring to the western Cordilleras of North America, Daly remarked:...the whole Rocky Mountain front, for hundreds of miles, has been pushed up andthen out, many miles over the plains. 161Writing specifically of Chief Mountain in Montana, he noted how it was:...thrust bodily upon much younger strata of the Great Plains, and then drivenover them eastwards, for a distance of at least eight miles. Indeed, the thrustmay have been several times eight miles. 162Such crustal dislocations embraced enormous areas and titanic tonnage. Forexample: \"All of the Glacier National Park in Montana and all the Rocky Mountainarea up to the Yellowhead Pass in Alberta\" was moved laterally for many miles163 . These mountains,picture5 [images/picture5.jpg]Fig 1.4. Youthful mountain profiles in the high Andes, southern Chile. CourtesyofPJ Michael, Univ of British Columbia, Canada.therefore, afford strident echoes of the situation already recorded in the Alpsand Himalayas and it is certainly no surprise to find Forrest adding:There is a good body of evidence, that the elevation of the western part ofNorth America (like that of Norway) was postglacial or late glacial. 164 (Ouritalics).Considering the Coast Ranges of southern California, another authority observed:\"There, within the short limits of the Pleistocene Epoch, strata a mile thickwere deposited\" 165 . These were later intensely eroded and deformed, being\"...finally... uplifted a quarter of a mile above the sea -the last episode isdemonstrated by a flight of marine terraces which marches like a Cyclopeanstairway up the seaward slope of some parts of the range\". 166This rate of deposition (not to mention the degree of crustal uplift - itself oflate or postglacial age) hugely transcended the norm demanded by Lyell'sgradualism, as also didthe geologically very recent and cataclysmic stratal contortion and upheaval, byat least 6,500ft (2,000m), of the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada inOregon and eastern California 167 .South of the Equator, the mighty Andes everywhere exhibit signs of extremeyouth-fulness. The longest continuous range on Earth, the Andes are actuallyvery ancient mountains which only acquired their present striking relief at theend of Pleistocene times 168 . This has been described as geologically veryrapid and attended by intense vul-canism 169 , several of the volcanoesattaining enormous heights. The Andean uplift was immense, with mountain passesin Peru and Bolivia often lying as much as 13,000ft (4,000m) above sea level.Everywhere the rugged and jagged profiles of the Andean peaks bespeak ofviolent, catastrophic formation.Confronting us at almost every turn are abundant, indisputable and tellinglyconsistent evidences of a geologically recent, worldwide orogeny characterisedby crustalpicture6 [images/picture6.jpg]Fig 1.5. Geologically youthful fault-grooves in the Peruvian Andes, near Cuzco.Formerly attributed to glacial action,this feature provides evidence of the magnitude of crustal disturbances.Courtesy ofDr Siegfried Muessig, Los Angeles, California.dislocations, upthrusts and faulting on a gargantuan scale. Recognition of thetruly global dimensions of this mountain-building has been long voiced bygeophysi-cists. Reviewing mountains generally, Dr Walter Bucher of ColumbiaUniversity has observed:Taken in their entirety, the orogenic belts are the result of worldwide stressesthat have acted on the crust as a whole. Certainly the pattern of these belts isnot what one would expect from wholly independent, purely local changes in thecrust\". 170A possibly even greater authority, Vening-Meinesz, asserted that: \"If we examinethe pattern of great geosynclines [large geological troughs] over the Earth'ssurface, we cannot doubt that their cause must have a worldwide character\" 171 .Commenting upon the same phenomena, Dr J H F Umbgrove admitted \"I feel there isoverwhelming evidence that the movements are the expression of a worldwide,active and deep-seated cause...\" 172 .A very large number of similar opinions could be cited, together with a largearray of varying hypotheses explaining the causes of orogeny. It is, unnecessaryto indulge in this here, although we would again emphasise the general agreementthat some worldwide cause was responsible for the phenomena just discussed.Suffice it to observe that something acting on a planetary scale and withstaggering power was basically responsible for these titanic crustaldisturbances in times geologically very recent, described by one writer as: \"Aremarkable and stupendous period - a period so startling that it might justly beaccepted with hesitation, were not the conception unavoidable before a series offacts as extraordinary as itself\" 173 .10 Collapse*Ts^fci.}i*>isr\"»We have already noted that crustal subsidences, sometimes amounting to veritablecollapses, occurred in some regions simultaneously with the late Pleistoceneelevation of mountains elsewhere. They were evidently part and parcel of thesame terrible world calamity, and a few words about them will be appropriatehere.Both the Canaries and the Azores experienced widespread volcanic activity duringlate Pleistocene times, the sea floor round the Azores in particular beingcovered by lava. Unlike the Canary and Madeira islands, the Azores are situatedon the eastern slope of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Since the great ocean basinseither side of it are only thinly coated with sediments and in places are actu-ally barren of them 174 , it is generally regarded as very youthful 175 . TheMid-Atlantic Ridge is also directly associated with a great world-encirclingfracture complex which we will discuss shortly. Tachylite, a lava whichnaturally disintegrates in sea water within 15,000 years of eruption, lies onthe sea-bed around the Azores and apparently dates from outpourings less than13,000 years ago. How much younger than that date is unknown. Notwithstandingthis, may we not wonder if all these islands were once a part of an Atlanticplateau extending westwards of the Anti-Atlas mountains - previously noted ashaving formerly extended to the Canary Islands - which submerged as recently asthe late Pleistocene? That such possibilitiesshould be seriously considered finds support in the discovery of geologicallyvery young beach sand in two deep-sea cores procured in this area from depths of10,500ft (3,250m) and 18,440ft (5,700m), indicating that the region was abovesea level at no very remote period. The noted oceanographer Maurice Ewingconcluded from this evidence that:Either the land must have sunk two or three miles, or the sea must once havebeen two or three miles lower than now. Either conclusion is startling 176 ....If the sea was once two miles lower, where would all the extra water havegone? 177Only the greatest conceivable disturbance could have produced crustal faults andcollapses as great as these.By the well-developed method of echo-sounding, an expedition in which Dr Ewingtook a prominent part measured the thickness of the sedimentary ooze on theslopes of the foothills of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These showed:...thousands of feet of sediment on the foothills of the Ridge. Surprisingly,however, in the great flat plains on either side of the Ridge, this sedimentappears to lie less than 100ft thick... Always it has been thought that thesediment must be extremely thick, since it had been accumulating for countlessages... But on the level basins that flank the Mid-Atlantic Ridge our signalscame back too close together to measure the time between them... They show thesediment in the basins is less than 100ft thick. 178Granitic and sedimentary rocks which must originally have been \"part of acontinent\" were dredged up near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from a depth of 3,600ft(1100m). They exhibited deep scratches and striations similar to those stones in'drift' formations commonly attributed to glacial action. However, in the samearea there were found \"...some loosely consolidated mud stones, so soft and weakthat they would not have held together in the iron grasp of a glacier. How theygotthere is another riddle to be solved by further research\" 179 . As discoveredearlier, it seems highly questionable that there ever was a glacial age of thetype clearly envisaged by Ewing and other geologists.Together with many other geological and topographic formations on the bed of theAtlantic these mud stones were formed not underwater but in the open air, andmust, despite their present fragile state, date from a time when that portion ofthe ocean floor was above sea level. A precisely similar conclusion has beenreached by another writer respecting the Mid-Atlantic Ridge itself. He wrote:...the inequalities, the mountains and valleys of its surface, could never havebeen produced in accordance with any laws for the deposition of sediment, nor bysubmarine elevation; but, on the contrary, must have been carved by agenciesacting above the water level. 180Although writing in the 1920s, the celebrated French geologist Pierre Termierspoke of a now-vanished North Atlantic landmass in terms as valid now as then.He stated:The conclusion is inevitable: the land which existed about 900km to the north ofthe Azores and, perhaps, embracing these isles, was plunged into the deep, intimes so comparatively recent that geologists call it 'the present', andactually it is as if it all happened for us but yesterday 181It may not be unreasonable, especially in view of confirmatory biologicalevidence to be detailed later, to regard the volcanic upheavals traced on thebed of the Atlantic around the Azores as having occurred synchronously with thebreakup and subsidence of Appalachia, the name given by geologists to acontinental landmass in the North Atlantic also known as North Atlantis™ 2 . Nowreposing some two miles (3.2km) below the level of the adjacent continentalshelves 183 , Appalachia connected Europe and North America via Greenland andIceland (see map IB). The fact that the degree of its submergence accordsclosely with that of the ocean basins flankingthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge as determined by Ewing, is particularly noteworthy.Although it is now impossible to estimate the true extent of Appalachia, itmust, as Brewster observed, have been:...a large continent, for the sand and gravel and mud which the rivers washedout to sea and the waves ground up on the shore have built up most of half adozen big, states [in North America], while in some places the deposits are amile thick. 184Like many others, Prof Scharff of Dublin argued that this landmass founderedduring late Tertiary times, excepting the Azores and the Madeiras which were:...still connected in early Pleistocene (Ice Age) times with the continents ofEurope and Africa, at a time when man had already made his appearance in westernEurope, and was able to reach the islands by land 185In Geikie's opinion, however, certain biological evidence - discussed more fullylater - shows that continuous land united Greenland and north-west Europe aslate as post-glacial times, a view shared by Prof Judd 18 ' 1 ; and Forrest wasamong those who concluded that this landmass \"...sank beneath the sea at the endof the Ice Age\" 187 .It is also relevant that a truly colossal amount of sea-bed scour, or erosion,has been traced between Greenland and North America and ascribed to a timeloosely termed as 'glacial' 188 . Presumably these crustal disturbances -collapses, for they were nothing less - occurred more or less simultaneouslywith the subsidence of the entire North Atlantic floor between Greenland andNorway by some 9,000ft (2750m), a convulsion which Forrest believed took place\"since the Ice Age\" 18 \". In our submission these tremendous changes occurredsynchronously with the break-up and drowning of the greater part ofFennoscandia, a now-submerged northern landmass formerlyMap IB.

Scale 1:130,000,000.connecting Spitzbergen with northern Eurasia (map IB).Leaving the Atlantic for the Indian Ocean we find in the latter interestingevidence for the geologically recent submergence of another extensive landmassor series of large islands which Wallace called the great Southern Continent 190. This submergence was apparently yet another facet of the global catastropheunder discussion and, as in so many other areas, here also it was accompanied bystupendous volcanic activity. Records of this were gathered by the Swedishsurvey ship Albatross in 1947, when, for several hundred miles south-east of SriLanka, it sailed over a vast and continuous plateau of hardened lava. Thisfilled almost all the earlier valleys on the sea-bed and gave the ocean floorthere a singularly level surface. One recent authority regarded this lava asbeing very probably the undersea counterpart of the Deccan trap of India 191 ,where basaltic lava several thousand feet thick continuously covers an area ofnot less than 250,000 square miles (647,500 km 2 ). According to H F Blanford,the eruption of this material may have been synchronous with the sinking ofWallace's Southern Continent, of which he believed the Seychelles, Mauritius,the Adas Bank, the Laccadives, Maldives and Chagos island groups, and the Sayade Malha (Mulha) are the last surviving remnants 142 . To Blanford's list canalso be added Sri Lanka, for it is believed to have been severed from the Indianstate of Madras \"in sub-recent times\" 193 .In passing, we should note that considerable botanical and zoological evidenceexists supporting the geologically-recent reality of extensive land in thesouthern Indian Ocean, and over much of present-day Oceania. Concerning thelatter, Prof Scharff has written:...Dr von Ihering goes so far as to positively state that in his opinion thePolynesian Islands are not volcanic eruptions of the sea floor, which beingwithout life were successively peopled from Australia and the neighbouringislands, but the remains of a great Pacific continent, which was inearly times connected with other continental masses. 194That the subsidence of this pan-Pacific land-mass occurred within the memory ofhumanity appears to be borne out by ancient Maori recollections of Hazvaiki,their ancestral 'fatherland' which, though properly outside the immediateconcern of geophysics, certainly represents curious but peculiarly tellingauxiliary records of this disaster. S P Smith summarised these memories asfollows:In some of these epithets of the ancient fatherland, it is clear to me that acontinent rather than an island is referred to, and this is the descriptiongiven to me of Hawaiki-nui, by Tare Watere Te Kahu, a very learned member of theNgai-Tahu tribe... 'Hawaiki-nui was a mainland (Tua Whemta) with vast plains onthe side towards the sea and a high range of snowy mountains on the inland side;through this country ran the river Tohinga' 195 .Numerous geological and palaeontological facts also apparently point to theformer and rather recent existence of this old Pacific continent, while theseverity of the cataclysm which overwhelmed it may be gauged by the staggeringlylarge crustal dislocations of 'late Pleistocene' date in central Westland, NewZealand. There, the vertical crustal uplift east of the great fault in theSouthern Alps (South Island) is estimated to have been as much as 58,500ft(18,000m) with a horizontal displacement of similar magnitude 19 \". Positivelystupefying, this crustal change represents a catastrophic action so huge that,even by itself, it would have caused worldwide repercussions. That it was merelya part of still greater crustal disturbances having ramifications far beyond NewZealand underscores the giant scale of these events in Oceania during timesusually stated as terminal Pleistocene. These changes extended even to thenorthernmost Pacific, where a continental-sized landmass, occupying the whole ofthe Bering Straits and the ocean-floor immediately south of it, foundered at theend ofPleistocene times. The scale of the subsidence of its western sector,particularly along the eastern coastline of the Kamchatka peninsula, wasspectacular. Science knows this sunken land as Beringia (see map IB).We may not err far in assuming that such tremendous crustal disorders occurredmore or less simultaneously with the subsidence of Appalachia, Fennoscandia andthe great sunken continent in the south Indian Ocean, and with the uprise of themany major mountain ranges previously mentioned. We shall now see that this wasalmost certainly so.11 ShatterThe formation of certain salient topographical features, such as fiords, areusually attributed in the majority of textbooks to the action of moving ice.Detailed field studies of the well-developed fiord systems of Greenland 197 ,the Hebrides 1 \" 8 and Scandinavia liw have tended to favour quite anotherexplanation, namely that they had a tectonic origin, are really gigantic cracksin the Earth's crust, occupied and partially modified by glaciers only at alater date. It has been discovered that glaciers do not hollow fiords, but,through the transportation of stony debris from higher to lower levels, tendinstead to choke fiord mouths and diminish or even nullify thereby the allegedexcavating power of glacier ice 200 . Numerous students of fiords are agreed onthis matter. Certainly ice cannot have easily produced those fiords which areopen at both ends 201 , or extend across sea-floors!Acceptance of a tectonic origin for fiords also eliminates the necessity ofattributing immensely long periods of time for their formation, such as would berequired had ice excavated them. This is an important point.Fiords also appear to be inseparably linked to a more fundamental crustalfracture complex encircling the globe, to which submarine canyons, deep-seatrenches and the celebrated Great Rift Valley of Africa all belong (seemap 1C). All seem to be connected with a huge crack which traverses the Earth'scrust for over 40,000 miles (64,000km) on a long meandering course 202 . Nearlyall the fractures associated with this giant crack show geologically youthfulimages. Many deep-sea trenches, for example, contain little in the way ofin-filling sediments, and the walls of many fractures are sharp and angular.General agreement exists that this fracturing occurred on a planetary scale andeverywhere at about the same time 203 . Some authorities have also argued that,for the observable effects to have been produced, the Earth's axis must formerlyhave been inclined in a more vertical plane than at present 204 . This also isan important point relative to the classical references to axial orientation inthe legendary Golden Age and Proctor's observation on the polar inclinationobtaining when the aquatic constellations were invented (see I: 5. A DisplacedAxis?).Dictionaries define excoriation as the stripping or removal of skin by abrasion.Here, we apply this process to the surface of the Earth's skin, its crust orlithosphere, in that it has caused the sudden fissuring and violent break-up ofmany surface rocks predating those classified as Pleistocene. This fissuringoccurred alike on land and under the sea, its extent being worldwide and clearlylinked topicture7 [images/picture7.jpg]£5c £(0 W1-23 a36acute crustal dislocation. Numerous submarine valleys are actually great crustalfractures now partially filled by sediments, and are intimately associated withthe collapse of areas now forming ocean basins and the faulting and submergenceof the continental shelves. It is particularly interesting to note some renownedauthorities suggesting that such profound changes might have been due toexternal influence exerted by some stellar body - a cosmic visitor 205 .Other fractures and rock fissures are demonstrably connected with the massivelate Pleistocene orogeny previously reviewed. The Gangetic Trough, for instance,evidently originated with the elevation of the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateauto their present height. The fact that the Gangetic Trough is 1,200 miles(1,900km) long, averages 250 miles (400km) in width, and is over 6,500ft(2,000m) deep, indicates the colossal power of the forces producing both it andthe associated orogeny. It is a Pleistocene feature, yet, although the mightyRiver Ganges now flows along it, the trough itself is largely choked byPleistocene debris of enormous thickness 20h . Gravity surveys have indicatedthat these in-filling deposits are about 6,500ft (2,000m) thick 2 \" 7 , and\"...cannot be earlier than sub-Recent\" in age 208 .Many further similar examples could be given from around the world, but suchrepetition would add little and would result in unnecessarily irksome reading.Suffice it here to observe that the foregoing evidence clearly shows that theend of the Pleistocene epoch, approximately 11,000 years ago, was characterisedby gigantic and violent crustal convulsions which, viewed globally, were nothingshort of cataclysmic. They did not punctuate a comparatively inert world inwhich the sub-polar latitudes lay under tremendously thick slow-movingice-sheets. The sheer volume and extent of the strata affected by thesedisorders and the great heights and depths to which strata were redistributedindicates that, if the ice-sheets of orthodoxy really existed, then the ice musthave covered regions which were either in the process of being enormouslyupheaved, displaced, vertically faulted and fissured, orsubsided to remarkable depths. None of these unstable crustal conditions couldhave been conducive to the formation or maintenance of ice-sheets like thoseconventionally envisaged.Special note should be taken of the repeated datings of these crustalderangements by acknowledged authorities: 'late Pleistocene', 'terminalPleistocene', 'end of the Ice Age', 'post-glacial', and so on. Although Agassizand other early advocates of the Ice Age argued that the ice developed beforethe rise of the Alps and other high ranges, modern glacialists all agree thathigh mountainous land is necessary to provide (and replenish) the snow fromwhich glacier ice is derived, to supposedly produce the various geologicalphenomena allegedly characteristic of glacial conditions. If, however, most ofthe world's present major ranges attained their existing elevations a mere11,000 years or so ago, where was the high land attracting heavy snowfalls andproviding the ice and the motive power for the alleged ice-sheets specificallystated to have preceded the modern uplands?Did ice in another guise cause the supposed glacial phenomena, distribute the'drift' and disperse the 'erratics'? Rather than ice-sheets, abnormal numbers of'drift'-laden icebergs were at one time conjectured as having floatedequatorwards from polar regions, depositing 'erratics' and 'drift' and polishingand striating rock surfaces as they did so. That hypothesis was eventuallydiscarded, as no reasonable mechanism could be determined which would generateexcessive numbers of icebergs for a limited (glacial) period, cease doing so fora following (interglacial) period, and then reactivate the cycle again - notonce but several times. Modern icebergs, moreover, carry little stony debris andvery few rocks that are describable as 'erratics'. It is certainly unscientificto suppose without good evidence that icebergs behaved differently in the pastor were burdened with stony cargoes vastly different from those they carrytoday.A closer look at conventional Ice Age concepts, at the capacity of large massesofice and at the geological phenomena commonly attributed to large scale iceaction, suggests that the Ice Age, if it ever really existed, must have done soafter the majorityof the above-mentioned crustal disturbances had taken place. Certainly theshattering of the Earth's crust had already occurred by that time.12 An Icy Chimera*~^m/i>j *s ^r*Inevitably the cause of the series of presumed ice advances and retreatsepitomising the supposed glacial and interglacial episodes has long puzzledEarth scientists and astronomers, who, down the years, have made many attemptsto explain them, rationally. Rather conveniently, these explanations have falleninto eight more or less distinct categories, thus:• Geophysical Tlieories: 1. continental drift (the slow drifting of crustalcontinents toward or away from each other); 2. polar wandering (slow changes inthe Earth's axis of rotation); 3. crustal sliding.• Land-Water Changes: 1. oceanic changes (relocated oceans, rearranged oceaniccirculation or changed directions of ocean currents); 2. landmass altitudechanges (larger land areas brought above the permanent snow line, feeding thegrowth of ice-sheets).• Glaciological Tlieories: periodic melting of basal ice layers of naturalice-caps, causing massive surging of ice leading to formation of huge peripheralice-shelves which, in turn, displace sea water sufficiently to produce suddenrises in world sea levels.• Atmospheric Changes: 1. variations in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere(reduction of amount of C0 2 ) and reduced rate of absorption by the atmosphereof long-wave radiation, causing atmospheric cooling; 2. variations in suspendedvolumes of volcanic and other dustin the atmosphere; 3. variations in ozone content.• Meteorological Changes: regarded as a secondary mechanism for promotingglacia-tion once the latter has commenced.• Axial and Orbital Changes: 1. alterations in axial tilt of the Earth; 2. the'Drayson Effect' (periodical axial changes leading to loss of terrestrialequilibrium); 3. changes in the length of the Earth's orbit around the sun.• Solar Emission Alterations: changes in the intensity or composition of solaremissions received by the Earth.• Astronomical Tlieories: 1. excessively cold regions in space traversed by thesolar system (and thus the Earth) during late Pleistocene times; 2. collisionsor near-misses with astronomical bodies disrupting the pre-glacial terrestrialenvironment (planets, moons, comets, asteroids and meteor showers have all beenproposed as candidates).Both 'uniformitarian' and 'catastrophist' explanations feature in this list. Allare essentially speculative, and none adequately explains the basic mechanism bywhich Pleistocene ocean levels (traceable from physical evidence) apparentlyoscillated by as much as 975ft (300m). Considering the shaky alliance betweenassumptions, conjecture and a misconceived topographical background longembodied in orthodox Ice Age discussion, it is little wonder that all theseexplana-tions have failed to account for all aspects of the so-called Ice Age enigma, Intheir present form they are incapable of doing so.Space limitations regrettably preclude detailed analyses of these ofteningenious hypotheses, so we shall pass on to briefly consider: (a) the mostcommonly offered description of the Ice Age itself, and (b) some of the manyreasons why, so the evidence tells us, the notion of the Ice Age can never havebeen more than a grand illusion.The classic definition of the Ice Age centres on the concept of extensive,continuous, and often enormously thick ice-sheets smothering virtually all polarlatitudes down to approximately 50° N and S latitude, with the greatest icyaccumulations apparently occurring in the northern hemisphere. This conceptreached its greatest development in the writings of various late nineteenthcentury glacialists, of whom Geikie 2iw , Dawkins 210 , Croll 211 and Penck 212were especially prominent. Although later research has signally emended thoseviews, from time to time the outmoded hypothesis they represented still findsits way into textbooks about Earth history, and persists in being the popularconcept of the Ice Age generally.More up-to-date views of the Ice Age world, in discarding the near-hemisphericice-sheets of the earlier theorists, have replaced those with a series of muchsmaller fluctuating ice-sheets radiating out from separate northern ice domes,with ice-free regions, some little more than corridors, existing between them.The retention of the term 'glacial', initially devised to accurately reflect thenature of the icy model postulated by nineteenth century glacialists, and itsapplication to modern Ice Age concepts, although technically correct,unfortunately still tends to perpetuate a false (the discarded) panorama forinterested modern lay-readers as yet familiar only with the older nineteenthcentury Ice Age doctrines. Certainly very few of the multitude of facts anddetails nullifying the earlier views which we are about to review havepercolated down to them.Thus, not only has much of this painstakingly amassed evidence largely failed tofilterdown to society generally, but so also have the modified (more modern)perspectives of the Ice Age now promoted in scientific circles. Accordingly,much of what follows, though factually correct, may at first seem not merelynovel but startling and perhaps even disturbing, as cherished conventionsfracture and totter.Today, the world's coldest known land region is north-eastern Siberia. There, ifanywhere, we might expect huge ice-sheets to have developed if the Ice Agetheory possessed validity. Yet comparatively very few areas of Siberia exhibitsigns of significant glaciation, either past or present. Clearly great cold doesnot of itself necessarily promote the development of ice-sheets. Antarctica andGreenland, however, both of which are less cold than Siberia, possess suchsheets. Later we shall examine why this is so.Interestingly, as in neighbouring Alaska to the East, thin rock pinnacles stillstand unglaciated at several Siberian localities which thick ice, had it onceexisted, would unquestionably have ground down and demolished. The sameobservation applies to the broken stumps and roots of large trees which, likethe mammoth carcasses found in the same general region (of which more anon) 2n ,have remained frozen solid ever since the day they perished, are still in thepositions in which they originally grew. Some are even replete with theiroriginal leaves, flowers and fruits 214 , albeit in permanently frozen andblackened condition. These, too, should have been scoured away had ice-sheetsever mantled and passed over Siberia. But these remains have not been destroyedany more than have the many thousands of others found as jumbled masses onseveral of the Arctic islands north of the Siberian mainland 215 or encounteredin similar confusion in the frozen ground of neighbouring Alaska 216 .Again, in stark contrast to orthodox Ice Age theory, even many northern areasoutside Siberia said to have lain under the thickest parts of the allegedice-sheets afford scant evidence of glaciation or ice-sculpturing of any sort,and in numerous cases are actually devoid of it. The Sverdrup Islands 217 ,northernmost Greenland 218 and many of the islands of the Canadian Arctic 21 \",not to mention practically the whole of Alaska, are cases in point. Spitzbergenis another 220 .As the following selection of information amply demonstrates, northern latitudeshave yielded several unexpected discoveries totally at variance with the tenetof vast sprawling North Polar ice-sheets. Their collective message is a singularone.Firstly, numerous marine shells, often of currently-existing species, lie athigh elevations on several islands in Arctic Canada 221 . They should have beenpulverised had ice-sheets ever crept across those territories, for in noinstance do they appear to have been deposited where they are now found sincealleged Ice Age times.Secondly, among the most telling details in this category are the numerousenclaves of unglaciated territory within regions which, glacialists long argued,supposedly lay under thick, continuous ice-sheets, not once but on severalsuccessive occasions. In addition to the molluscan testimony just noted, weshould carefully mark that no evidence is known from southern Scotland ofglaciation antedating the so-called latest observable ice advance, whichglacialists call the Weichselian advance. Indeed, it has lately been urged thatnot only was southern Scottish topography much the same before the Ice Age as itis now 222 , but also that south-western Scotland suffered less glacial erosionthan surrounding regions because of its generally lower altitude 223 -despiteglacialists depicting that area as a major centre of glaciation on Ice Age mapsof Britain (see map ID)."},{"pageContent":"Farther north, deeply weathered, undisturbed, soils in Aberdeenshire wereseemingly never glaciated, while further north still, on the North Sea bed nearthe Shetland islands, supposed glacial deposits dated as Weichselian areunexpectedly thin or absent altogether 22 *. Again, in the Frigg Field area(59°N, 2°E) midway between the Shetlands and Norway, sea-floor cores are devoidof identifiable glacial deposits. This discovery has suggested that:...some part of the northern North Sea was ice-free in the late Weichselianglacialadvance, but this is difficult to reconcile with the suggestion that Shetlandwas glaciated in the Weichselian by ice which came from the east - probably fromScandinavia. 225Similar problems surround the presence of demonstrably British 'erratic'boulders of porphyry, limestone and sandstone on and just south of the DoggerBank area of the North Sea, because the Weichselian ice sheet alleged to havetransported them there is commonly envisaged as having advanced from thedirection of Norway to the northeast 226 . These 'erratics' can only havetravelled from the north-west against the supposed direction of the Weichselianice-flow.Significantly, comparable evidence occurs in the Outer Hebrides on the otherside of the British Isles. There, rock striae indicate that whatever scored themproceeded from the north-west. Hebridean glaciation is usually held to haveadvanced from the north-east, the very opposite direction 227 .Data from the Faeroe islands, even farther north, cast further doubts on thevery existence of former extensive ice-sheets in the North Sea region. Depositsattributed to ice action have been interpreted there as due to local ice,\"...rather than to an ice-sheet advancing from the north or having contact withthe Norwegian mer de glace\" 226 .On mainland Britain, several 'drift'-less areas in northern England - south ofYork, for example 224 - reinforce the general picture now emerging, as does theapparent failure of any ice to have crossed the North Sea to terrain north ofthe Humber 230 .During so-called Weichselian times the Norwegian mountains were supposedly thecentre of a regular mer de glace which, at its maximum, stretchedsouth-westwards to embrace not only the Faeroes, Shetlands and Orkneys, mainlandScotland and Wales, all but southernmost England and the entire North Sea area,but also the whole of Eire. As previously noted, many parts of this extensiveregion were apparently never glaciated at all - a detail parallelled by theabsence of detectable glaciation on the Lofoten islandspicture8 [images/picture8.jpg]Pre-Weichaelian ice southern limitWeichaelian (Devonian) »^ ice southern limitCentre of ice outflowSupposed direction of ice flow marked&Belgium100 miles 150 kmMap ID.

Compiled from several sources.(68°N, 15°E) 231 and the unglaciated character of innumerable jagged rocks offNorway's western coast 232 . Moreover, the lower deposits occupying the adjacentNorwegian deep-sea trench are also apparently non-glacial 233 .Why is glacial evidence absent from parts of mainland Britain and the bed of theNorth Sea if an ice-sheet allegedly mantled that entire region? Was it because,as intimated earlier, glacial action actually never occurred there?Notable reinterpretations of alleged glacial deposits in England and Irelandhave also recently been proposed. At Ipswich in Suffolk, well known glacialsequences formerly considered as representative of three glacial phases are nowregarded as typifying only one 234 . Again, despite a supposedlywell-established stratigraphy (identification of the relative position of layersof deposits), there is now little evidence that in Northern Ireland 'drift'deposits are much older than 10,000 years BP 235 , a date commonly stated to bethat when the Ice Age finally ended.Comparable evidence is also known from mainland Europe, the North Atlantic, theArctic Ocean and North America - but as we have already noted several examplesfrom some of these regions we need mention here only a small selection ofadditional instances.In Europe, the Alpine record of glaciation -the earliest studies of which,remember, initiated the concept of an Ice Age - shows it to be not only veryyouthful 236 , but also surprisingly sparse. Indeed, except for deposits ofWeichselian date, the overall record there is \"very spotty\" 237 .It is a very well known fact that much of the world's rainfall occurs whenwindblown, moisture-laden air rises over upland areas, and that when thisconcerns mountains or high hills the moisture often descends not as rain but assnow. Especially relevant to this is the conclusion reached by the celebratedglacialist Albrecht Penck, that Alpine snowfall during Ice Age times was notappreciably heavier than that of today 238 . If that were indeed so, it would beillogical to postulate that immense ice-sheets developed then in and around theAlps if they do not do sonow. But other important factors are involved and should be considered here.The Alps attained their present height suddenly and violently in times so recentthat their upthrust actually post-dated the era normally assigned to the Ice Ageitself. Thus the Alps, as we know them, hardly existed when the Ice Age issupposed to have occurred. They were merely a \"chain of low hills\". This meansthat, if the Alps were formerly much lower, they were unlikely to have attractedthe heavier snowfalls required to underpin the formation of the huge ice-sheetsof conventional Ice Age dogma.If the Alps, Rockies, Himalayas and other major mountain ranges rose to theirpresent elevations only at the close of the Pleistocene epoch - during or justafter the final stages (the Younger Dryas episode) of the supposed Ice Age, wecan scarcely continue to associate the development of massive ice-sheets withmountain systems generally too low to have acted as effective causal agents ofsuch glaciation. Significantly, no ice-sheets of any magnitude are presentlydeveloping in or around the world's greatest mountain ranges, themselves all nowmuch higher than in Pleistocene times. As we shall see later, the greatice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have formed as a result of the operationof other factors.Thus, if many of today's highest mountains were much lower when the alleged IceAge was reputedly at its zenith, how did so much ice, if it actually existed,manage to accumulate? Indeed, we can take a step further and ask whether theice-sheets so beloved of glacialists ever existed at alV.In addition to the above-mentioned objections, many more exist which echo thesame query. A look at some of these is educational.Claims that glacial deposits exist on the floor of the Barents Sea, north ofNorway, have lately been dismissed as incorrect. No glacial mantle ever existedthere, and none ever connected Scandinavia, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land orSpitzbergen 239 . The aforementioned detail that Spitzbergen was apparentlynever glaciated is thus found to be entirely compatible with the absence ofglacial deposits on the surrounding sea-floor.picture9 [images/picture9.jpg]Map IE. Map of alleged maximum extent of Pleistocene glaciation in the NorthernHemisphere. After W C Putnam.Yet innumerable maps of the Ice Age have long persisted in depicting the regionembracing all these lands, as also that of the Alps, as buried under enormousice-sheets (see map IE).Earlier, we drew attention to the remarkable speed with which the final stage ofthe Ice Age - the Younger Dryas episode of late Weichselian times - came to anend, and how its closing stages were linked to abrupt increases in snowfall andradical oceanic, climatic and botanical changes across much of the northernhemisphere.Initially it might be considered reasonable to expect the end of an Ice Age toherald warmer conditions, but widespread investigations have shown that thereverse actually happened: temperatures generally fell as the effects attendingthe termination of the Younger Dryas episode (or Allerod as it is sometimesreferred to) were experienced globally 24 \".Sea-surface temperatures, for example, dropped in the North Atlantic 241 , inthe western North Pacific 242 , in the South China Sea 243 and even in thetropical Sulu Seabetween the Philippines and northern Borneo (Kalimantan) 244 , where marinecores indicate a \"pronounced cooling of surface waters during Younger Dryastimes\" in tandem with an increased summer monsoonal regime in central China 245.Late Pleistocene sediments in deep-sea cores obtained from the bed of thecentral North Atlantic contain the remains of plank-tonic foraminifera - minutemarine organisms - which collectively exhibit faunal patterns so complex thatthey cannot have resulted from temperature oscillations like those commonlyassociated with glacial cycles 246 . Similar puzzles have been afforded bymarine cores from the Caribbean basin. These show a former mixing of top andbottom ocean-water layers ten times faster than the speed at which thesuccession of glacial and interglacial episodes is supposed to have taken place.It was, therefore, concluded that:...because of the unique character of deep-sea sedimentation, a change in theaverage would require major alterations to thephysiography of the earth and/or in the biological balance of the high seas. 247As shown by other aforementioned data, that is precisely what the general recordof Younger Dryas times repeatedly urges. Effects of changes like these werewidespread. They were, for example, felt around Hudson Bay 248 , across AtlanticCanada 24 \" and in the northeastern USA 250 , and occurred even as far south asSouth America and Antarctica 251 .The demonstrably global extent of these environmental changes, which inevitablyaffected plants and land animals in many latitudes, isparallelled by a similar worldwide concordance of their general dates ofoccurrence.In southern Chile, for example, where these changes impoverished older beetlepopulations 252 , their effects took place about 10,000 years BP 2 \",approximately at the time when North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures dropped254 . Tibet became suddenly wetter 255 , and the vegetation in north-western USAunderwent marked changes 256 . Very clearly something important occurred duringor just before the 10,000 years BP datum indicated, something large enough toaffect practically the whole of Earth's environmental conditions and hugenumbers of the planet's natural inhabitants.13 Inescapable Evidencer^Sij&i-iJ&izr*To those accustomed to the now well-established notion of a Pleistocene Ice Agelike that advocated by Agassiz and championed so forcefully by Geikie and othersin the last century, or who are aware of the modifications made to it thiscentury, the substance and abundance of the foregoing interrelated details maywell astonish. After all, has not the idea of an Ice Age been carefullyinvestigated from every angle by armies of experts in multitudes of concerneddisciplines for over 150 years? Although the actual cause of the Ice Age isstill uncertain the reality of such an age is surely beyond dispute? Surely somany specialists cannot all have consistently misread the record for so long?The underlying problem, of course, has been the continued acceptance of theconstraints inherent in Lyell's 'uniformitarian-ism', with its insistence uponterrestrial agencies being the sole generators of observable topographical andatmospheric changes,irrespective of the individual scale, speed or intensity of these. A majoroutcome of this entrenched perspective has been the steady accumulation ofunaccommodatable data diametrically opposed to, or at least highly bruising of,Lyellian concepts and the notion of an Ice Age.Dispassionate consideration of this 'anomalous' data leads unerringly to therealisation that: 'uniformitarianism', while certainly not a fallaciousdoctrine, is yet no more than a particular aspect of a wider whole - which wediscussed earlier in Part One: 7 Perspectives -a question of scale; also, thatsomething other than ice, operating in a worldwide capacity, was responsible forthe deposition of 'drift' and the creation of other supposedly Ice Agephenomena.Probably no clearer account of the supposed deposition of 'drift' material bylarge slow moving ice-sheets like those of conventional Ice Age theory can becited than that given a few years ago by L Dudley Stamp,who, recognising two major effects of gla tion, wrote:cia-One of the two major effects of glaciation is... the sweeping bare of largetracts of the country, and the time which has elapsed since has generally beeninadequate for the formation of a complete soil mantle. There are large tractsof bare rock: soils which have been formed are characterised by immatureprofiles, whilst the interference with the pre-glacial drainage has resulted inwater-logging over huge tracts and the consequent development of extensivebogs...The other major result of glaciation is the deposition on lower ground or onmarginal areas of the material swept from the highlands. The mantle of glacialdeposits which results is conveniently referred to under the comprehensive term'drift'. Drift deposits are of the most varied character, and although two typesmay be very closely related in geological origin they may be so different inlithological characters [rock composition] as to give rise to land forms, soilsand vegetation of the most contrasted types. 257Like those of all conventional glacialists, Stamp's summary, though factuallyaccurate respecting the variability and distribution of 'drift' depositsgenerally, is a typically unifor-mitarian explanation of the relevant phenomena.In it the Ice Age is assumed to have been an indisputable fact, whereas it neverwas nor has been more than an ingenious theory. Slow ice movements areadvocated; ice is so completely accepted as having been the 'drift'-producingagent that it is spoken of as having certainly produced both it and theobviously attendant geological effects; the scale and extent of the supposedice-sheets are inferred from the scale and extent of the 'drift' depositsallegedly produced by them -a circular argument. Nor does Stamp's expositionsatisfactorily account for the presence in some areas of 'drift' on hill summitsonly. As we shall now see, these assumptions, while superficially attractive,are seriously at odds with a whole range of recorded facts.Part One: A Lost Beginning 45Particularly interesting and certainly perplexing is the well-established factthat many allegedly glaciated hills and mountains in the northern hemisphere arescored and striated from top to bottom on their northern sides only. In NorthAmerica this remarkable condition is quite common 2 * 1 . It would thus seemthat ice-sheets glaciated the northern and north-western faces of theseeminences as they slowly crawled up them but failed to glaciate the southernslopes as they presumably accelerated down them - an effect completely oppositeto that allegedly generated by downward-moving masses of ice - for example, thatof glaciers. In any case, as shown below, ice cannot ascend hills.Of further relevance is the fact that deposits of gravel and other 'drift'materials sometimes occur only on the northern and north-western flanks ofhills, in some instances showing every indication of having been actuallyplastered up against the hillsides with great force 259 . Many cases of thisoccur on both sides of the Atlantic. In Labrador, for example, 'erratic'boulders have been rammed into hillsides apparently with much violence 260 .Rather interestingly, eastern Labrador, together with Newfoundland, wasapparently never glaciated 261 .A strange selectivity arises here.Also noteworthy is the occurrence of so-called 'drift' materials at localitiesfar beyond the limits of the most extensively conceived ice-sheets. Thus, if iceaction genuinely distributed all the 'drift' deposits within the supposed limitsof the greatest ice-sheets then it somehow also contrived to do so in many areasice is supposed never to have reached.Large 'erratic' boulders in the Sahara Desert; on the Mongolian plains, and insubtropical Uruguay constitute a parallel anomaly. And when it is discoveredthat it is possible to produce rock striae like those usually attributed to iceaction (see figs 1.6-1.9) by such dissimilar agents as drift-sand 262 ,fast-moving nuees ardentes (swiftly flowing, high temperature, gaseous cloudserupted from volcanoes, see fig 1.8), snow, mudslides 263 and high pressuregrit-charged steam 264 , we are obliged to seriously questionpicture10 [images/picture10.jpg]Fig 1.6. A rock at Appley Bridge near Wigan, England, showing surface striationscommonly ascribed to ice-action. Reproduced by permission of the Director,British Geological Survey: NERC copyright reserved.the alleged glacial origin of striae generally, particularly when, as innumerous instances, they, too, occur far outside the furthest traceable limitsof supposed bygone ice-sheets.Still other 'peculiarities' are exhibited by geological phenomena associatedwith Ice Age doctrine. Scrutinised more closely these also reveal yet moredoubts about the former reality of an Ice Age like that favoured by orthodoxy.Eroded and fragmentary shells occur within the 'drift' deposits on Moel Tryfaen,a mountain in North Wales rising 1,300ft (400m) above sea level. Perplexinglythe species represented include not only northern but also temperate andsouthern forms adapted to very varied habitats. Some required deep and othersshallow water, some sandy and others muddy water, and some were peculiar toshingly and others to a bare rocky environment 265 .In contrast to the above we now perceive an unnatural generality in theevidence.In stating that ice could never have brought together so varied a molluscanassemblage as this, it is hardly necessary toadd that water could have - in which case the enveloping 'drift' deposits musthave been similarly water-borne. Such a conclusion was reached by the greatEnglish geologist Roderick Murchison with regard to the 'drift' deposits ofRussia 266 , and by many of the earlier American geologists respecting the samebeds in the USA. One of these geologists, Prof Andrews, as cited by Howorth,remarked that many:...gravel hills are sharp and conical and interspersed with deep circularvalleys without outlets, from which the region has obtained the popular name ofthe Potash Kettles... It would seem to be an unavoidable inference that ourdrift of this region not only came from the north, but it came in a vast sweepof water deep enough to cover gravel hills 800ft high, and with velocity enoughto throw coarse material into lofty and steep summits. 267Again, it may be asked how is it possible to ascribe to ice in any form thesimultaneouspicture11 [images/picture11.jpg]Fig 1.7.

But it didn't.Nor, we may point out, did ice-sheets allegedly capable of producing resultslike those just enumerated ever invade the regions inhabited by the southernshell species. Nevertheless, the same species occurin 'drift' deposits at many places located in temperate zones supposedly laiddown by ice-sheets said to have proceeded from the north. Here we have anotherexample of 'inferred' ice action and direction of operation at variance withfield evidence.Puzzling though the evidence is, ice assuredly never simultaneously transportedto the same locality so many climatically-undifferentiated shell species - andMoel Tryfaen is but one of several very similar instances elsewhere. It followstherefore that ice did not accumulate the enveloping 'drift' deposits either, orthose like it elsewhere. Nor, as further corollary, can it have dispersed the'erratic' boulders or striated rock surfaces intimately associated with the'drift' beds.And, it may also be asked, why do the 'erratics' and the 'drift' (as in Eire forexample 268 ) sometimes abound on the higher peaks only to be absent fromadjacent lower ground? Such effects are scarcely those of normal'uniformitarian' actions.Indeed, the longer such problems are pondered the less likely it seems that icecould,picture16 [images/picture16.jpg]Fig 1.12. The giant erratic Madison Boulder at Conway, New Hampshire, estimatedto weigh not less than 10,000 tonnes. The human figures show the boulder's greatsize. Photo: R A Daly, \"The Changing World of the Ice Age\", 1934, bypermission of Yale Univ Press.under any conceivable circumstances, have caused such effects, and indicationsmount up that the supposed Ice Age of Pleistocene times was really no more thanan icy chimera. If so, then the validity of the Pleistocene period itself, as adistinct geological division, is also called into question.But before the Ice Age is pre-emptorally jettisoned here as the causal agentbehind all the above-mentioned phenomena, let us be certain that all normalactions of ice have been duly considered and abandoned as untenable for soundreasons. Nothing less satisfies.As presently understood, the physics of ice suggests that, on attaining asufficient thickness, the supposed ice-sheets of the Ice Age must have movedunder the influence of gravity, and that, due to the enormous weight of the ice,the movement would have been downwards - from higher to lower levels. Due to thecomposition of ice, this movement or flow would have to be viscous (semi-fluidor sticky). This means that only the basal layers of the ice-sheet would havemoved on downhill gradients, and that only its upper layers would have movedover flat country. Sir Henry Howorth emphasised this when he wrote:A more important and far-reaching difficulty... is the proved incapacity ofglacier ice, as of any other viscous body, to travel over enormous stretches oflevel country, and up and down long hills, as it must have done if the glacialtheory is to become the final and effective explanation of a large part of thedrift phenomena. 269Glacialists, however, have usually argued that glaciers do not behave in thesame way as ice-sheets (such as those on Greenland and in Antarctica), a pointalso dealt with by Howorth as follows:It is... useless to quote glaciers to the ice men. They repudiate glaciers astests altogether [a long way from Agassiz's and Charpenrier's original ideas:authors], just as they repudiate laboratory experiments upon ice. Withpicture17 [images/picture17.jpg]picture18 [images/picture18.jpg]Fig 1.14. Erratic boulder near Nairn, Scottish Highlands.them all inductive methods and arguments fail, since they always reply that theice they appeal to is something entirely different to the ice of glaciers. It isice-sheets they rely upon, portentous ice-sheets such as no longer existanywhere. A Saturnian postulate, in fact, is their platform, and not a mundaneone. Yet it ought to be a condition even of such a transcendental postulate asthis that the ice in an ice-sheet should act in accordance with, and notcontrary to, the nature and the physical qualities of ice. If it does not, theappeal ceases to be a scientific appeal, and it is, in fact, very largely anunscientific appeal which is continually being made by this noisy, clamorousschool of writers, who never verify their premises and make assumptions asreadily as they abandon them.An ice-sheet is only a great mass of ice after all; a mass of ice which, insteadof lying on a mountain slope or being embayed in a valley or on a plane surface,is supposed to have smothered and covered a stretch of uneven country andswathed itin a continuous mantle, Such a mass of ice cannot acquire properties notpossessed by other ice. If it moves it must move according to the mechanics ofice and, as we have seen, ice moves in no other fashion than by the influence ofgravity 270At this juncture we interject the observation that to advocate causes in thepast which differed from those of present experience, so far as ice isconcerned, is actually contrary to the uniformitarian principles glacialistsclaim to uphold. Considering ice as a solid, Howorth went on to note:If a solid be so heavy and so big that it requires more than a certain force tomove it, it will crush rather than move, that is to say, the whole thrust willbe dissipated by the object being reduced to pulp, or even liquid, which willflow away rather than move en masse. 271Many earlier glacialists spoke of these ice-sheets being hundreds, perhapsthousands offeet thick. Howorth, complaining at such extravagances, exposed theirshortcomings thus:...it is not possible to pile up a mass of ice to an indefinite height, or toforce a mass of ice of greater length than about seven miles along a levelsurface by any pressure, however obtained, without its crushing, and without,therefore, the thrusting force being dissipated. 272A glance at map IE showing alleged glacia-tion in the Northern Hemisphere showsthat the extent of these ice-sheets greatly exceeds \"about seven miles\", thatthe topography of considerable areas (especially in North America) wasessentially flat or level, and that in other regions allegedly mantled byice-sheets it was singularly rugged. Thus, according to ice physics, theseice-sheets should not have been capable of moving over either level or ruggedterrain. The properties of ice preclude this.The excavating and demolition powers of thick moving ice, relative to theglacialist's assumption that ice-sheets broke up the surface strata theysupposedly over-rode, were also discussed by Howorth, who observed:Ice is much softer and more easily crushed than the great majority of rocks, andwould itself be crushed and reduced to slush by its own pressure long before therock upon which it stands could itself be broken... We must always remember thekinds of materials upon which the supposed crushing was effected. These are notlumps of soft rock showing crushed outlines, but clean broken and shatteredmasses with their surfaces still raw and unhealed, consisting of the hardestcrystalline rocks such as granites, seynites, porphyries, etc, as well aslimestones, sandstones and chalk, and we are asked to believe that the sameice-sheets which thus shattered such intractable materials in situ after passingon a few yards travelled over beds of laminated and stratified sand and loamwith such a gentle touch as not to disturb the laminations...The word impossible is not a favourite of mine, but I am bound to say that, ifit is... applied to any physical operation, I know of none where it seems soapplicable as to the process appealed to by the ultra-glacialists for themanufacture of drift by an ice-sheet smashing its own bed. 273Very interestingly, ice is protective as well as destructive. The incalculablepower of thick ice moving continuously down a gradient is, of course, wellknown, and such ice may well have planed off rock surfaces, scored and striatedothers, and removed previous loose boulders and unconsolidated surface depositsobstructing its downward course. But to achieve this the ice must be moving. Onreaching level terrain the ice-flow would speedily cease. It has long beenestablished that glaciers on descending-to-level ground quickly lose theirforward momentum. Stationary, ice fails to significantly injure even fragileshells or loose accumulations of soft sand or grits. It simply stagnates and,very often, slowly melts away. Thus ice on level terrain, being, as we have justnoted, unable to move in any direction of its own volition, would tend toactually protect rather than abrade any land surface it mantled. Indeed, thegreat ice-sheet presently covering the land surface of Antarctica appears toplay an almost totally protective role 274 . The ice there also exhibits anotable absence of stony debris in the glaciers and icebergs so typical of thatsouthern continent, despite the fact that its sub-ice topography is in placesknown to be ruggedly mountainous. Consequently there is a singular scarcity ofsurface moraines in Antarctica - a certain pointer to the near-minimal surfacescour presently occurring there. Yet, during so-called Ice Age times, greatice-sheets like that of Antarctica are stated to have caused spectacular landsurface damage on virtually a hemispheric scale!While on the subject of 'scour' and 'debris' relative to ice action, two furtherpoints of marked significance merit close attention here.If, relative to different types of terrain, the aforementioned orthodoxcontentions re-specting ice action during the Ice Age really do represent the norm of glacialbehaviour, then why did ice fail to remove the unconsolidated 'drift' depositsfrom many of the higher peaks - which the ice allegedly smothered or overrode -and yet sweep bare much of the nearby lower ground where large accumulations of'drift' should logically occur? The field evidence on this matter seems to bediametrically opposed to the acknowledged normal processes of ice action ongradients and level surfaces as described above. Indeed, in terms of modernglacier action, the 'drift' actually exhibits characteristics fatally atvariance with that action, even if applied to the most conservative Ice Agescenario.It is undoubtedly noteworthy that neither mountain glaciers generally, nor theAntarctic or Greenland ice-sheets, are now accumulating extensive 'drift'-likedeposits. Moreover, present glacier moraines contain angular rocks unlike theusually rounded stones and boulders in the 'drift' itself. These latter arethemselves usually rounder than that other vexatious Ice Age phenomenon, the'erratics' - the significance of this point will become clearer later in thisbook. It can be truly held, therefore, that modern glacial (glacier) depositspossess virtually no typical 'drift'-like features and should be more accuratelydescribed as 'heterogeneous (unstratified) muck'.Again, although moraines are today found at the foot of many glaciers, it doesnot necessarily signify that every moraine associated with 'drift' deposits wasactually produced by glacial action. A receding sea-tide will leave what isessentially a moraine upon a beach, and at least one good record is known of amorainic structure formed by unusually severe cloudbursts - moraines whichcovered several acres and contained trees, soil, stones and boulders weighing upto an estimated 100 tonnes each 275 .As repeatedly recorded, 'drift' is often encountered in the most unexpectedplaces. The collective effect of such distribution is the very opposite of thatwhich could be anticipated from thick ice-sheets allegedly disintegrating therock surfaces they are said tohave over-ridden. Such theoretical ice movements could be expected to sweep bareall hillsides and summits, accumulating the resultant debris ('drift') invalleys and on lower ground. That the 'drift' was often not deposited anddistributed in that fashion only serves to support the aforementioned fact thatice (even as huge sheets) does not and cannot naturally ascend gradients (letalone the steep inclines and summits of lofty hills and mountains). Nor, asHoworth and others have stressed, should we expect ice -under whatever guise -to have behaved differently in the past.If, therefore, past and present ice movements were essentially identical, theice-sheets of glacial theory could have flowed down gradients only, or forstrictly limited distances across generally flat countryside. From this itfollows that the succession of glacial advances and retreats envisaged byglacialists as typifying Pleistocene times, and supposed to have ebbed andflowed across hundreds, even thousands of miles of diverse terrain, were more orless physical impossibilities, In short, they cannot have actually existed. Thusthe distinctive names awarded this alternating cycle of glacial advances andretreats (see table IB) also become largely meaningless.Numerous lines of enquiry converge upon the startling fact that the Ice Age oforthodoxy is no more than the shaky theory it always has been and its allegedformer reality, as conceived by its advocates, just a wonderful myth. There wasindeed an 'ice age', but, as shown later in this book, it occurred at a laterdate and was of comparatively brief duration.If, as demonstrated, the great ice-sheets so beloved of glacialists neverexisted, because the uplands so necessary for their development and maintenancewere either too low or non-existent during alleged Ice Age times, and becauseice, even very thick ice, cannot behave in the manner required by glacialtheory, it follows that other geological phenomena commonly ascribed to massiveice-action were caused by some other agency or combination of circumstances.Among such phenomena may be mentioned moraines,striated rocks, rock flutings, giant surface grooves, cirques (bowl-shapedhollows at the top of valleys), hanging valleys (tributary valleys hanging highabove valleys they feed into), roch.es moutonnees (polished rock surfaces),kettle-holes (small bowl-like depressions), drumlins (oval hillocks), eskers(longgravel ridges), kames (sand-gravel ridges), 'erratic' boulders and various othertypes of surface denudation. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider thesefeatures here, although we shall return to them later when we identify theagencies which unquestionably caused them.14Turmoil UnleashedST^fc-J-itSi^\"*The idea of huge circumpolar ice-sheets relentlessly creeping for thousands ofyears across extensive swathes of land rendered desolate and frigid, and inwhich nothing very sudden occurred (save, perhaps, the collapse of large piecesof ice), has long been an essentially uniformitarian concept. The occurrence ofso much ice has often been regarded more as a biological than as a geophysicalcatastrophe, but one which, operating so slowly in most regions, has come to bethought of as gradual. Neither the biological nor the geological record,however, support this view, for both reflect catastrophe and destruction on aglobal scale.It is widely agreed that, towards the close of Pleistocene times, profoundclimatic deterioration occurred worldwide. Numerous life-forms previouslydominant or very prolific either became extinct or greatly depleted numerically.This change affected the animal and vegetable kingdoms equally, marking in facta Great Divide in the terrestrial biological record. From a uniformitarianstandpoint, this was a truly extraordinary occurrence representing a realcatastrophe.So widespread is the evidence for these changes, and so apparentlyindiscriminate the annihilation of diverse animal groups, that the closingstages of the Pleistocene period might justifiably be styled an age of wholesaleslaughter. In the words of Prof L CEiseley, the phenomenon drives \"...the biologist to despair as he surveys theextinction of so many species and genera in the closing Pleistocene\" 276 .Considering these exterminations further, he added:We are not dealing with a single, isolated relict species but with aconsiderable variety of Pleistocene forms, all of which must be accorded, in thelight of cultural evidence, an approximately similar time of extinction 277In Europe immense herds of diverse animals utterly vanished off the face of theEarth for no obvious biological reason. They were seemingly virile, numericallystrong faunal groups, well adapted to their natural environment, yet,geologically speaking, they disappeared with frightening abruptness. The samebiological decimation was enacted simultaneously in Australasia, Asia andAfrica. Of the latter G E Pilgrim noted:...at approximately the same time we witness a similar extinction of the mammalfaunas of Africa and Asia, though in their case this may not have been caused byglacial conditions. 278What conditions could these have been? Conditions acting as effectively outsidethe alleged limits of the hypothetical polar ice-sheets as within them, and on a hemispheric scale.In the New World, for example, practically the whole Pleistocene mammalian faunawas wiped out or reduced to a pitiful vestige of its former greatness. Among themammals so affected were:...all the camels, all the horses, all the ground sloths, two genera ofmusk-oxen, peccaries, certain antelopes, a giant bison with a horn spread of sixfeet, a giant beaver-like animal, a stag-moose and several kinds of cats, someof which were of lion-size. 27 \"Additions to this list include several types of elephants, including the mammothand the mastodon (though a few individuals are known to have survivedPleistocene times in North America), all the northern rhinoceroses, giantarmadillos, several kinds of bear, numerous members of the canine family,tapirs, a variety of rodents, and various large flightless birds.Coincident with this dreadful slaughter upon the land was the deposition farinland of myriads of contemporary marine shells, and the stranding at greatelevations of marine mammals such as whales, porpoises, walruses and seals.Elsewhere, vast forests were flattened and buried under equally vastaccumulations of sand or mud or piled up in broken and twisted heaps. At somelocalities plant remains were packed so densely and in such abundance as to formlignite (soft brown coal akin to peat) beds of great extent 280 , while atothers animal and plant remains were mixed together in inexpressible confusionas heterogeneous masses. In Alaska, for example, thick frozen deposits ofvolcanic ash, silts, sands, boulders, lenticles and ribbons of unmelted ice, andcountless relics of late Pleistocene animals and plants lie jumbled together inno discernible order, This amazing deposit, usually referred to as 'muck', hasbeen described by Dr Rainey as containing:...enormous numbers of frozen bones of extinct animals, such as the mammoth,picture19 [images/picture19.jpg]Fig 1.15. A typical exposure of Alaskan 'muck', composed of chaoticallydispersed fragments of trees, plants and animals in frozen silt and lenses ofice. Courtesy of Prof Frank C Hibben, Dept of Anthropology, Univ of New Mexico.mastodon, super bison and horse, as well as brush, stumps, moss and freshwatermolluscs. 281Hibben described these deposits in very similar language:In many places, Alaskan muck is packed with animal bones and debris in trainloadlots. Bones of mammoths, mastodons, several kinds of bison, horses, wolves,bears, and lions tell a story of a faunal population... within this frozen masslie the twisted parts of animals and trees intermingled with lenses of ice andlayers of peat and mosses. It looks as though in the midst of some cataclysmiccatastrophe of ten thousand years ago the whole Alaskan world of living animalsand plants was suddenly frozen in mid-motion in a grim charade. 282In another publication, the same author commented:Although the formation of the deposits of muck is not clear, there is ampleevidence that at least portions of this material were deposited undercatastrophic conditions. Mammal remains are for the most part dismembered anddisarticulated, even though some fragments yet retain, in their frozen state,portions of ligaments, skin, hair and flesh. Twisted and torn trees are piled insplintered masses... at least four considerable layers of volcanic ash may betraced in these deposits, although they are extremely warped and distorted. 283Hibben also suggested that this volcanic ash contributed to the wholesale deathand destruction we have been reviewing. He wrote:One of the most interesting theories of the Pleistocene end is that whichexplains this ancient tragedy by worldwide, earth-shaking volcanic eruptions ofcatastrophic violence. This bizarre idea, queerly enough, has considerablesupport, especially in the Alaskan and Siberian regions. Interspersed in themuck depths, and sometimes through the very piles of bones and tusksthemselves, are layers of volcanic ash. There is no doubt that coincidental withthe end of the Pleistocene animals, at least in Alaska, there were volcaniceruptions of tremendous proportions... Toxic clouds of gas from volcanicupheavals could well cause death on a gigantic scale... 284We shall later have a few words to say about late Pleistocene vulcanicityworldwide, so we merely mention here that at least 76 major volcanoes, bothcurrently active and recently extinct, exist today in the Aleutian islandsimmediately south-west of Alaska alone. Many of these appear to have been activearound late Pleistocene times.Hibben's observations also introduce the element of great heat into the argumentsurrounding the problematical origin of the so-called Ice Age. Discussing theproblem from the viewpoint of physics, the celebrated Victorian physicist JohnTyndall, as long ago as 1883, stressed that \"...the enormous extension ofglaciers in bygone ages demonstrates just as rigidly, the operation of heat aswell as the action of cold\" 285 .Although Tyndall has since been proved wrong on some counts, his remarksrespecting great heat required for the formation of widespread ice-sheets arestill correct and have been upheld by nearly all later geo-physicists. Amongthese was Dr Donald Menzel of Harvard who, after examining the problem from anastronomical viewpoint, opined:If solar variability caused the ice ages, I should prefer to believe thatincreased warmth brought them on, whereas a diminution of heat caused them tostop. 286So, even if they really existed, the huge ice-sheets of Pleistocene times neededgreat heat for their formation, an element conceivably provided by manyvolcanoes erupting simultaneously. Such an event, if it actually occurred, mustalso have generated tremendous atmospheric pollution and hurricane force winds287 . That it did occur seems to be indisputably established from the massivelate Pleistocene vulcanism traceable not onlyin Alaska but, as shown later, in many other regions both north and south of theequator. Such extensive vulcanism must obviously have been due to some stillmore fundamental cause.The frightful hurricanes just alluded to were doubtless primary factors in thedemise of so much insect and bird life during late Pleistocene times - for whatagency other than extremely violent winds could have brought together in oneplace such dissimilar avian species as the following? They included: Grebes,herons, bitterns, storks, wood ibises, spoonbills, swans, various geese(including the snow goose), ducks, American vultures, kites, many kinds ofhawks, falcons, eagles, caracaras, the Teratornis, quails, cranes, partridges,turkeys, rails, gallinules, parrots, coots, plovers, turnstones, woodcock,snipes, surf-scooters, stilts, sandpipers, barn owls, seven other owl species,flycatchers, woodpeckers, swallows, jays, crows, magpies, titmice, chickadees,ravens, mockingbirds, waxwings, thrashers, meadowlarks, shrikes, two species ofblackbird, redwings, orioles, finches, sparrows and buntings 288 . Remains ofall these birds were discovered in the late Pleistocene tar-seeps at McKittrickin California, and the asphalt pits at Rancho La Brea in the same state.This extraordinary assemblage is not an isolated freak occurrence. In latePleistocene deposits at San Pedro, also in California, the following mixed birdassemblage was found with the remains of camel, bison, a ground-sloth, variousrodents and the mammals known as Felis, Megalonyx and Aenocyon: loon, ancientmurrolet, black-footed albatross, black-vented shearwater, fulmar, Brandt'scormorant, green-winged teal, mallard duck, cinnamon teal, white-fronted goose,surf-scooter, Californian quail, turkey vulture and western meadowlark 289 . Allbut the first, second and fourth species are still in existence, although likethe equivalents from Rancho La Brea and McKittrick they are now spread over manydifferent latitudes and occupy very different habitats. It is more than probablethat most if not all these birds never originally dwelt together in the placeswhere we now find their bones. They were brought together from variousdirections involuntarily by irresistiblewinds and buried in a common grave by, it would appear, catastrophic agencies.Again, how does one correlate the extremely varied remains in the lignitedeposits at Geiseltal in Germany with the theory of uniformity? Although nowregarded as partially of Tertiary and partially of Pleistocene age 290 , thetropical plants, insects and animals embedded in them do not square with theequivalents typical of the steppe conditions often stated to have beencharacteristic of that latitude during late Pleistocene times. The amazingpreservation of the soft parts of many of these organisms suggests a very recentorigin of the entire assemblage. The insect fauna, for example, is a modern one.It occurs \"...in present Africa, in East Asia and in America in various regions,preserved in almost original purity\" 291 .Complete insects, however, are rarities. The vast majority have been torn apart- and suddenly at that, because the process of fos-silisation of all survivingparts with silica invading the tissues must have been virtually instantaneous('Fast blitzschnell' - German), and was undoubtedly responsible for preservingthe membranes and original colours of these insects so marvelously 292 .For the vertebrated animals (animals with a spinal column) these lignites are averitable graveyard. The bones of giant constrictor snakes, East Africansalamanders, crocodiles, South American condor, an Indo-Australian bird,marsupial mammals, apes, as well as, paradoxically, mammals from northern steppehabitats, lie buried together in no particular order 293 .The plant remains are also perplexing. Fungi and algae still attached to leavesimpressed into the lignites are today found only on plants in Brazil, theCameroons and Java-*'. Chlorophyll is also preserved in many of the leaveswhich, numbering literally billions, form huge beds within these lignites. Theleaves belong to plants from all parts of the world, not just from one or twoclimatic zones only. The leaves are also mostly shredded so that only their finefibres or nervous systems remain intact. The fibres often retain their originalgreen (chlorophyllic) colour, and indicate that the leaves must have beenrapidly excluded from contact with air and light, and buried almost immediatelythey were stripped from the parent plants 2 \" 5 . Many of the plant speciesconcerned still flourish in the tropics today.Only some tremendous hurricane acting in concert with vast surging masses ofwater could have transported and accumulated these remains at Geiseltal - ahurricane and a deluge operating on a scale and with a ferocity far beyond thatof which modern humanity has any experience.These remarkable faunal and floral assemblages at McKittrick, Rancho La Brea andGeiseltal form singular parallels with the aforementioned shell assemblagesfound in the 'drift' at Moel Tryfaen in North Wales.Further examples, not detailed here, are also known from other parts of theworld. The process responsible for these effects clearly operated not only atmany widely-sundered localities and at more or less the same point in Earthhistory, but affected plants, invertebrates, insects and land, sea and airanimals equally. In other words, it acted globally and indiscriminately. Alliedwith the phenomena found in Alaska, a repeating pattern of wholesaledestruction, often involving organisms which could never have lived in thevicinity of huge ice-sheets, emerges worldwide. It was a time when appallingcarnage and tremendous natural disturbances occurred hand in hand. Put bluntly,it was a time of unbridled turmoil.15Evidence from the Arctic«-^i%fcj,;>i43isr-»Not as spectacular, perhaps, as the animal fossils discovered in Alaska andSiberian Russia, the equivalent botanical evidence from the Arctic isnevertheless of similar importance. Above all, it represents essentiallysedentary life which mostly lived and died where its remains now occur. Adaptedto well-defined climatic zones and altitudinal habitats, plants faithfullyreflect the meteorological conditions which must have formerly prevailed wheretheir fossils now repose. Taken as a whole, the flora constitutes a naturalliving background against which normally more mobile life-forms - for example,insects, molluscs and vertebrated animals - live and die. Plant cover in oneform or another is virtually a prerequisite haven for such mobile organisms and,amongst other things, functions locally as a partial humidity control. Itsimportance for other life-forms cannot be overemphasised.The former existence of a warm, equable region traditionally sited somewhere inthe north - often specifically at or near the North Pole itself - would, we mayreasonably infer, have been clothed with abundant vegetation by the very natureof such a climatic regime. Much irrefutable evidence indicates that it was so.Palaeobotanists are well aware that a milder climate formerly prevailedthroughout much of the present Arctic.Numerous discoveries of warmth-loving plant remains assigned a Miocene orPliocene date have been made at many northern localities, including Spitzbergen,the east and west coasts of Greenland, the islands comprising Kong Karl Land,Ellesmere Island, Banks Island and Alaska. Virtually identical remains occur onthe Kamchatka peninsula of eastern Siberia, now lying well south of the ArcticCircle. Further consideration of these remains leads to some interestingconclusions.Today, the winter temperature at 81 °N, which is well inside the Arctic Circle,can and does drop from, -40°C to a still lower figure at the Pole itself,although even this does not reach that of the 'Cold Pole' in Siberia where, inthe Oymya kon-Verkhoyansk basins, temperatures as low as -70°C have beenrecorded 2 *. Conversely, the summer temperatures in latitude 81 °N reach a cool3°C 2Ci7 .Such severe temperature fluctuations obviously restrict the type and range ofvegetation capable of surviving these extremes. Thus, if conventional conceptsof lengthy Pleistocene glaciations and interglacial episodes are correct, thesenorthern plant assemblages can have changed but little for hundreds of thousandsof years. Plant records immediately preceding Pleistocene times, however, revealthat a markedly different flora flourished then in present Arctic latitudes,showing these to have been far warmer than they are today, and that many of thegenera and species hardly differed from those which now thrive much furthersouth. The findings of Prof F E Weiss, quoted by H E Forrest, stressed this:It has been shown by Heer, Unger, Ettinghausen and others that many plants ofthe Miocene period are so closely related to those of today that they cannot bedistinguished as separate species (eg Taxodium disticum), and in most cases theliving species are very closely related to those of the Miocene period [which isgenerally believed to have ended at least ten million years ago! - authors]MiocenePopulus balsaminoides Platanus aceroides Sequoia sternbergii Sequoia langsdorfiiRecentPopulus balsamifera Platanus occidentalis Sequoia gigantea Sequoia sempervirensThis indicates that there has been very little change since that period and wemust consider the distribution of plants today in the light of that whichexisted in the Tertiary period. The remains from that period also show that thespecies occurring at that time had a much wider distribution, in the NorthernHemisphere at all events, than isthe case nowadays. We may take it that the circumpolar flora of that time wasmost nearly related to the existing flora of northeast America, including as itdid such genera as Liquidambar, Vitis, Magnolia and Liriodendron.™It is more than curious that the existing flora of Greenland shows thatflowering plants, which are said to have survived there from pre-glacial times,indicate that this so-called glacial epoch must have been much less severe thancommonly believed 29 '', especially as Greenland is conventionally stated tohave been repeatedly buried under enormously thick ice-sheets in Ice Age times,which obliterated everything in their path.Early scientific expeditions to Spitzbergen discovered and collected 136specimens of Miocene plants representing species of fir, spruce, marsh cypress,hazel, elm, sequoia, liquidambar, gingkos, tulip trees, magnolia and freshwaterplants 300 . A similar picture came to light near Disko island off westernGreenland where pine cones, acorns and other plants were discovered last century301 . Further finds elsewhere in Arctic America concerned temperate-zone treessuch as walnut, beech, oak, poplar, lime - some with fruit still on the branches- maple, magnolia, cypress, plane trees and conifers 302 . Some remainsrepresented tropical ferns and the breadfruit 303 . Rather unexpectedly, many ofthese remains occurred in a sparry iron ore 304 , a fact which will later assumemuch significance. Elaborating upon this evidence Sir Charles Lyell remarked:Professor Heer has examined the various collections of fossil plants that havebeen obtained in Northern Greenland (latitude 70°N), Iceland, Spitzbergen andother parts of the Arctic regions, and has determined that they are of Mioceneage, and indicate a temperate climate. The Arctic Miocene flora now comprises194 species, and that of Greenland 137 species, of which 46, or exactly onethird, are identical with plants found in the Miocene beds of Central Europe.Considerably more than half the number are trees, which is more remark-able since at the present day trees do not exist in any part of Greenland even10° further south. More than 30 species of Coniferae have been found, includingseveral sequoias (allied to the gigantic Wellingtonia of California)... alsobeeches, oaks, planes, maples, walnuts, limes and even a Magnolia... andromeda,hazel, blackthorn, holly, dogwood and hawthorn. A species of zamia (zamites)grew in the swamps, with potamogeton, sparganium and menyanthes, while ivy andvines twined round the forest trees, and broad-leaved ferns grew beneath theirshade. Even in Spitzbergen, as far north as latitude 78°, no less than 95species of fossil plants have been obtained, including hazel, poplar, alder,beech, plane-tree and lime. Such a vigorous growth of trees within 12° of thePole, where now a dwarf willow and a few herbaceous plants form the onlyvegetation and where the ground is covered with almost perpetual snow and ice,is truly remarkable. The identity of so many of the fossils with Miocene speciesof central Europe not only proves that the climate of Greenland was much warmerthan it is now, but also renders it probable that a much more uniform climateprevailed over the entire Northern Hemisphere 305 .While adding further botanical species to these impressive lists, modernresearch has merely confirmed the Miocene character and luxuriance of theseancient northern forests. It was, however, this same evidence which, lastcentury, prompted the view that the terrestrial axis must have changed sinceMiocene times 10 ''. The great Swedish geographer, Nordenskiold, concluded thatsummer temperatures then at latitude 78°N must have attained at least 14-15°C tohave permitted the survival of these plants 307 . He was, however, greatlypuzzled at being unable to find any transitional plants in northern latitudeswhich bridged the Miocene/Pliocene/postglacial gap 308 . Everywhere there seemedto be a sudden change from an older Miocene/ Pliocene flora to a modern(post-glacial) one, in which plant types linking the two regimes wereconspicuously absent. Nordenskioldeventually decided that, without leaving one transitional plant to be foundtoday, the glacial scour of the Ice Age must have ground up or carried away allevidence of such vegetation in northern latitudes 309 . Nordenskiold subscribed,of course, to the then-fashionable theory of immensely thick ice-sheets mantlinggreat regions of the northern hemisphere.Iceland was also formerly milder than it is today. The presence there in claysdescribed as 'very late Pleistocene' of large trees such as oak, maple, sequoia,spruce and others is irrefutable proof of this. Collectively, they point to aformer mean annual temperature of 11°C. It has been suggested that these treesflourished during an \"interglacial warm period\" 310 , yet their mode ofinterment within the clays bespeaks of sudden agitated conditions, the veryreverse of those supposedly typifying the so-called interglacial episodes.Interestingly, PEP Norton concluded, after studying the remains of shells andpieces of wood in deposits assigned a late Pleistocene or early Holocene age atTjornes in northern Iceland, that they had been accumulated under violentlyagitated circumstances 311 . Dated as being 11,000-12,500 years old, thesefossils indicate that this part of Iceland remained unglaciated 312 at a timeelswhere alleged to have featured prodigious ice-sheets which, by then said tohave been slowly melting, still dominated many northern landscapes.The aforementioned absence of glaciation of sizable areas of Arctic Canada mayhave been still greater than generally conceded; for although Cornwallis andDevon islands at 75°32'N are commonly believed to have been glaciated and aredepicted as being so on maps reconstructing Ice Age times, Grinnell Land stillfurther north at the polar end of Ellesmere Island, Banks Island and PrincePatrick Island all yield evidence militating against the notion that they wereever glaciated at all.On the contrary, immense quantities of ancient permanently frozen wood, pinecones and acorns lie at an elevation of some 150ft (46m) above present sea levelnear the centre of Banks Island. One of the trees discoveredthere had apparently grown on the spot and retained many of its leaves, albeitblackened and withered 111 . Significantly, no oaks now flourish within severalhundred miles of this island, so where have the acorns come from? Eleven othertrees found on Banks Island were later identified as conifers of North Americantype, and two species of flowering plants were also recognised among this debris114 .Supposed driftwood, much of it semi-fossil, was also encountered last centuryalong the shores of Banks Island, at some places as much as 580ft (177m) abovesea level 315 . Sir Robert McClure, who made many of these discoveries, foundtraces of former immense forests at several other localities on the island,about which Robert Damon of Weymouth wrote as follows:Sir Robert McClure mentions, in his narrative of the discovery of the north-westpassage, the existence of a fossil forest on Banks Land, latitude 74°25', where,for a depth of 40ft, the cliff was composed of one mass of fossil trees... 120miles further north... [existed]... a similar kind of fossil forest. 116McClure met with comparable remains of ancient trees still further North, atlatitude 76°12N, on Prince Patrick Island, where trunks as much as 4ft (1.3m) incircumference occurred. Some were so ancient that the wood had lost itscombustibility and refused to burn 317 .Although Geikie thought these trees were probably referable to the Mioceneperiod 318 , the fact that they were superficially in a condition which, inother circumstances, would be regarded as combustible, suggests that they, too,were not properly fossilised and not, therefore, referable to such a remotelydistant period as the Miocene. Nevertheless, these trees may indeed haverepresented typical Miocene species which, as we have repeatedly noticed,seemingly survived almost unchanged across many presently Arctic regions fromthe Miocene period down to late Pleistocene times - despite the interventionbetween those temporal extremes of the whole of the Pliocene and Pleistoceneepochs (seetable 1A). Such possibilities are enormously enhanced when we again note, asNordenskiold and other palaeobotanists also have, that in Arctic lands thechange from an older Miocene/Pliocene flora to a modern (post-glacial) one,without transitional botanical species, was not only abrupt but occurredgeologically very recently indeed.If, as previously argued, the glacial and interglacial successions typifyingconventional Ice Age times never actually existed, and if, as has also beensuggested, some kind of post-Miocene axial shift has occurred, thenNordenskiold's problem respecting the hiatus in the Arctic botanical recordevaporates, for no transitional plants ever existed either, and the traceablechanges were fundamentally environmental ones. Plants, being sensitiveenvironmental 'thermometers', merely reflected those changes. Abrupt changesinevitably precluded the development of transitional plant species.What this really means is that, while a rich and diverse botanical assemblagenow preserved in sub-fossil form at various Arctic sites represents an ancientMiocene/Pliocene flora, the discovered specimens of it do not date from suchdistant times but are remnants of the last representatives of that flora whichperished during the widespread environmental changes experienced across thesenorthern latitudes at the close of Pleistocene times. Very significantly, as weshall shortly discover, a geologically late survival of ancient biota isduplicated in the record of the sub-fossilised animals entombed in thePleistocene rock fissures and bone caves further south, where Miocene andPliocene species sometimes lie cheek-by-jowl with Pleistocene and even modern(existing) species.Further aspects of these profound northern changes and of the orthodoxreconstructions of Ice Age times also exist which briefly merit consideration.Among the more important of these are the conditions existing on either side ofthe northern end of the Nares Strait, the narrow channel which, straddlinglatitude 82°N, separates north-western Greenland from Grinnell Land on EllesmereIsland. There, conditions believedly typical of glacial and interglacialepisodes of Ice Age times exist side by side 319 , for despite its far northernlocation Grinnell Land features little permanent ice and hosts a considerablevariety of plants which grow upon non-glacial soils, whereas Greenland, acrossthe Strait, is perpetually smothered in snow and ice.Here is an instance where glacial and so-called interglacial conditions do not,as in most Ice Age models, have to be successive. Given the appropriateconditions, they can be coeval. That such contrasting conditions can actuallyexist in such close geographical proximity on opposite sides of the Nares Straitis due largely to the warm waters of the western branch of the Gulf Streamflowing northwards up Davis Strait as far as Grinnell Land and influencingconditions there conducive to plant growth. Such conditions, however, areapparently exceptional, for, as shown earlier, the existence in alleged Ice Agetimes of extensive and lengthy glacial and interglacial episodes duringconditions of near-hemispheric extent is no longer really tenable. The evidencesupposedly representative of them requires alternative interpretation.Here, a further point concerning soils also arises.If Grinnell Land, as presumed by orthodox Ice Age dogma (but contrary to fieldevidence), was formerly glaciated by thick scouring ice-sheets, why did the icenot remove that region's original (old) soil - as has apparently occurred acrossmuch of northern mainland Canada (although not on many of that country's Arcticislands, where the aforementioned tree and plant remains testify so eloquentlyto its retention)? Enormous ice sheets of the type so commonly a part ofstandard Ice Age scenarios should have scoured away all such soil and all thebotanical remains just discussed.It has long been known that glacial soils are generally sterile and, for lengthyperiods following their deposition, do not encourage plant growth. Highlightingthis point many years ago, the American naturalist McGee, as cited by Howorth,observed:...crude soils, such as fresh glacial clays from some yards beneath the surface,arenot adapted to the support of luxuriant vegetation. 320Drawing upon the conclusions of several earlier authorities, McGee added:...of the valleys laid bare at the glacial period, those whose glaciersretreated first present a richer and more varied vegetation than those whichremained a long time covered with ice... The western slope of the RockyMountains exhibits abundant traces of glaciation evidently quite recent,geologically speaking, though it may well be doubted whether the glaciers haveexisted within many centuries, yet scarcely any vegetation has sprung up on thelight glacial soil. 321 )Here, therefore, is a further detail suggesting that Grinnell Land, and probablymuch of Ellesmere Island as a whole, was never extensively glaciated, if at all.But the absence of appreciable soils across huge northern stretches (theCanadian-, Hudson Bay- or Laurentian-Shield 322 ) of mainland Canada, as alsoparts of western Siberia 323 and Finland 324 , if not removed by ice thatseemingly never was, must have resulted from the operation of other agencies.Wind and water are the only two alternative agents which could conceivably haveproduced the observable effects. Their operation, however, would have had tohave been on a stupendous scale.Together with the frozen soils of 'unglaciat-ed' Alaska and eastern Siberia,with their abundant refrigerated relics of flowering and fruit-bearing trees andplants belonging to species now unable to grow in such high latitudes, thebotanical testimony of the Canadian Arctic islands indicates the richness of theflora that formerly flourished in Arctic latitudes under climatic conditionsclearly very different from those now extant there. Nor do we need remindingthat the cessation of those conditions was apparently sudden, complete, andoccurred at the very close of so-called Ice Age (Younger Dryas) times withastonishing rapidity (see 1:5 A Displaced Axis?); or that an equablepre-cata-strophic Golden Age traditionally existingduring the 'childhood of humanity' in northern latitudes, where life existed inserenity. The traditional end of this paradisical world is consistentlydescribed as sudden and violent - a not unexpected fate of an era terminated byagencies which, on the basis of the aforementioned astronomical data, perhapsinvolved a change to the tilt of Earth's rota-tional axis. As we shall see later, a surprisingly large number of scholars havediscussed this possibility. One scarcely needs to add that any such axial changewould inevitably have generated major climatic changes and would have engenderedbiological destructions of exactly the magnitude the aforementioned evidenceindicates.16An Interim Summary«~vi?**'jiA*sr\"»Having now reached a point where the validity and significance of severaldiverse but related aspects of recent Earth history have been outlined in somedetail, it may, before continuing further, be useful here to recapitulate themain themes discussed and the conclusions reached, especially as thesecollectively form the terrestrial background against which the awesome sagatraced throughout the remainder of this book originally unfolded.We have seen that humanity's age-old preoccupation with world history hassteadily evolved from simple beliefs featuring a succession of ill-defined WorldAges (or World Suns) - each allegedly terminating cata-strophically - and thatthe most widely remembered and recent of these events was the Great Flood orDeluge of traditional and scriptural histories.The interrelated questions of the 'date of Creation' and the 'age of the Earth'figured prominently in the deliberations of many classical and post-classicalhistorians who, until the late 1820s, regarded the Deluge as not only real butas an important datum in practically all their historical schemes. They freelyused the terms 'antediluvian' and 'post-diluvian' to denote pre-Flood andpost-Flood events, peoples and things.Irrespective of the particular strata from which they were obtained, fossils,which had apparently fascinated people since prehistoric times, were widelyregarded as the physical remnants of antediluvian creatures drowned in theDeluge, although some thinkers realised quite early on that certain fossilsrepresented organisms which had left no living descendants, and that someapparently belonged to eras so distant from ours that these were alreadyimmensely ancient even before the Deluge. Estimates of the real age of the worldwere regularly recalculated and slowly extended from a few thousand years tohundreds of thousands, and ultimately to millions of years - sufficient time, inthe opinion of some adventurous scholars, in which pre-Adamites (people beforeAdam, the traditional 'first' man) could have lived or evolved.Astronomical discoveries during the late 1600s and early 1700s revealed theperiodicity of many comets and the existence of gravity, for the first time.William Whiston, who was cognizant of these discoveries and a friend of many whohad made them, was seemingly the earliest to have proposed the idea that acomet, passing close to Earth, had gravitationally displaced the oceans andcaused them to overflow their natural basins as a vast worldwide Flood. Thistheory wasset out in a book which, published in 1696 and another in 1717 327 , showed howthe Deluge could have occurred through the 'geo-physics' involved, and how itcould have been a cosmically rather than a terrestrially-induced event.Through providing a hitherto-missing workable mechanism - a defensible cause, asagainst that traditionally invoking unverifiable 'divine wrath' - confirming onthe basis of cold scientific facts the apparent veracity of the scriptural andtraditional accounts of a tremendous prehistoric Flood, Whiston's booksaccordingly became very influential and, in the process, initiated the'scientific' foundation of the 'Catastrophist' school of thought.During the 130 years or so following Whiston's books, the hypothesis of acomet-induced Deluge was enthusiastically cultivated by scientists and churchmenalike. The theory seemed to satisfactorily embrace both their sets of beliefs.Ultimately, however, their application of the theory to a whole range of naturalphenomena became ever more forced and unlikely, and a point was eventuallyreached where 'catastrophism', as represented by Whiston's hypothesis, hadclearly overstepped its mark and reached absurd proportions. Academiciansreacted by seeking alternative, less sensational explanations.Re-studies of many natural phenomena eventually resulted in the appearanceduring the early 1830s of Charles Lyell's now famous 'Theory of Uniformity', inwhich the extravagances of the catastrophists were discarded in favour of slow,gradual changes extending over immense periods of time. The age of the Earththus grew longer still, and Lyell's new approach (actually built in part onearlier but at that time insufficiently noticed similar ideas advanced by JamesHutton and William Smith) was swiftly acclaimed - one suspects as much as arelief from previous rampant 'catastrophism' as from any general recognition of'uniformity's' inherent merits.From Lyell's work sprang the 'uniformitar-ian' school of thought, which has eversince been in opposition to that of the catastrophists and has assumedascendancy over it. It should be noted, however, that 'cata-strophism' has never entirely died out, and has recently received support fromsome eminent sources 325 .But even before, and after, Lyell's day, naturalists acknowledged that certaingeological phenomena existed which bespoke of sudden and violent changes - thevery opposite of the calm uniformitarian norm. The phenomena included polishedand striated rocks, 'erratic' boulders, extensive unstratified 'drift' deposits,abruptly frozen mammoth and rhinoceros carcasses in Siberia, and an astonishingprofusion of unreasonably jumbled bony remains of countless incompatible animalsin caves and rock fissures on every continent. Although fuller consideration ofthese remarkable burials occurs in Part Two, neither they nor the otheranomalies just listed could be readily accounted for by uniformitarian tenets,especially as in almost every case they were primarily surface phenomena andtherefore geologically youthful. Lengthy ages of serene conditions could neverhave produced them.Nevertheless, less than ten years after the publication of Lyell's theory,another was proposed which, amongst other things, was thought to satisfactorilyexplain most of this anomalous material on non-catastrophic grounds. This wasthe Ice Age or glacial theory of the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz. LikeLyell's, it was destined to become exceedingly influential in geological andbiological circles.Giant glaciers and huge ice-sheets smothering all but the highest peaks innorthern lands were the main features in Agassiz's hypothesis. Ice, not Delugewaters, had purportedly striated and polished hard rocks, distributed the'erratics' and had deposited the unconsolidated 'drift'. Thus, wherever suchphenomena existed, that was where prodigious quantities of ice formerly existedand produced these effects. Above all, ice is slow-acting.Though still exceptional, the frozen Siberian animal carcasses were, as theybelonged to species also entombed unfrozen in geologically youthful 'drift'deposits elsewhere, quickly regarded as being similarly youthful. The relevantindividuals, it was reasoned, must have belonged to animalswhich had lived and died in glacial conditions. Geologists invented a specialepoch, the 'Pleistocene', to accommodate all such material.The champions of ice as a causal agent for so many 'Pleistocene phenomena'could, it seemed, adequately account even for apparent anomalies like these.Accordingly, the Deluge ceased to be regarded as the cause of the 'drift' andassociated geological phenomena, and was no longer recognised as an importantbenchmark in' history. If it had ever occurred it probably had been a localevent of scant significance outside the region it affected.Encouraged by the apparent merits of Agassiz's theory, geologists everywhererenewed their studies of geological evidence previously ascribed to diluvialaction. The outcome was a number of important, and sometimes diametricallyopposed, developments.Several separate alleged ice advances (sta-dials), alternating with ice retreats(interstadi-als) were professedly recognised. Elaborate schemes, in which theadvances were generally envisaged as having been from polar latitudesequatorwards, were devised to explain these. To accommodate these stadials andinterstadials, which, a priori, were imagined as lengthy episodes due to theusual slow actions of ice, the 'Pleistocene' period lengthened again. Somemodern estimates of its duration make this span as much as three million years326 .Particular attention was paid to what had actually caused the Ice age. Manyexplanations were proposed and discarded. None met all the necessary criteria -a situation still the case today.Extended field studies also began to reveal serious defects in Agassiz'shypothesis. 'Erratic' boulders and 'drift' deposits were discovered in regionsthat even the most massive ice-sheets could never have reached. These, however,were also essentially identical to the 'erratics' and 'drift' of more northernareas where large accumulations of ice could most certainly once have existed.Conversely, 'drift' was found to be singularly absent from many northernlocalities where, if Ice Age theory was correct, it should occur.Wind, water, mud-slides and various volcanic actions, as well as other agencies,began to be recognised as equally capable of scoring and striating rocks undergiven conditions. The predominant orientation of rock stria-tions wassurprisingly consistent throughout much of the northern hemisphere, and wassometimes associated with 'drift' deposits confined to northern or north-westernmountain slopes, or to areas devoid of 'drift' altogether. In many areas striaeaffected older topographical features in ways that frequently negated all knownice behaviour.Extraordinary accumulations of incompatible organisms - shells, birds, mammals,plants and so on - were encountered in 'drift' deposits hundreds, eventhousands, of miles too far north of their present habitats. Southwards-movingice could hardly have transported such remains to the localities yielding them.Elsewhere, extensive debris of ancient forests were met with in northern landsnow far too cold to support any such vegetation, yet the immense ice-sheets ofconventional Ice Age dogma had somehow avoided them and failed to scour awaytheir trunks and branches as it had allegedly scoured away rocks elsewhere whenaccumulating the 'drift' deposits.The orthodox concept of immense sprawling polar ice-sheets which, after longages, slowly melted away, is, like the modified versions of it developed since,so full of fatal shortcomings and so at variance with inescapable fieldevidence, that the standard notion of the Ice Age must now be regarded asfundamentally flawed and almost certainly a chimera. Indeed, any application ofit hemi-spherically, as was formerly common practice, is undoubtedly fallacious.Nevertheless, something - if not ice - had to have occurred which created anddistributed so widely the so-called 'glacial' phenomena - and geologicallylately at that, as the phenomena themselves are demonstrably youthful too.Geologists have established that a similar modernity characterised theshattering, collapse and upheaval of many sizable portions of the Earth's crust,as well as the concomitant elevation of most of our planet's highest mountainranges. Many highly competentauthorities have been united in describing these huge disturbances ingraphically catastrophic terms, dating them as having occurred 'at the end ofthe Ice Age', 'at the close of the Pleistocene epoch' or 'in sub-Recent times' -quite the reverse of what could be reasonably expected of uninterrupteduniformitarian conditions.It is clear that before the onset of these disturbances world topographydiffered appreciably from that of today The Alps were simply 'a chain of lowhills'; the proto-Rockies, if they truly existed, were actually locatedconsiderably farther west; the Gobi desert was allegedly a great inland sea. Afull list of these changes is impressively long and everywhere reflects theeffects of a worldwide catastrophe.In whatever guise even a small pre-cata-strophic Ice Age might have existed, it,like the full-blown chimerical one disposed of above, certainly never sprawledacross topographies familiar to modern people.Palaeontologists and biologists have likewise reached generally similarconclusions respecting the demise of countless plants and animals on allcontinents 'at the close of the Pleistocene epoch'. Extinctions then weresudden, violent, frighteningly wholesale, indiscriminate and very extensive.Science has also determined, as will be elaborated on more fully anon, that manyof the animals concerned were not adapted to the widespread glacial conditionssupposedly typical of many regions immediately preceding these extinctions, butwere more suited to milder and gentler regimes. The refrigerated evidence ofwarm/temperate vegetation from Arctic lands independently and strikinglysupports that scenario, and suggests that some alteration of the axial tilt ofthe Earth may have attended the aforementioned crustal disturbances. They alsointimate that the earliest histories which refer to remotely ancient timesepitomised by a Golden Age may, after all, allude to some long-forgottenreality.Evidence thus converges from numerous directions to support the conclusion that,on the testimony of radio-carbon and other dating techniques, immense physicaland climat-ic changes occurred on Earth some 11,000 years or so ago - when an Ice Age thatprobably never was came to an end, and an apparently typical uniformitarianregime was abruptly terminated.The collective and unavoidable message of these and other innumerable details isthat, at some stage, colossal masses of water played a very important (althoughnot the only) role in effecting these changes. This again suggests that the manysurviving accounts of a worldwide Deluge long ago may yet be found to rest upona substratum of now dimly-remembered fact.Be that as it may, however, geophysics (as presently understood) reveals thatEarth is seemingly incapable of generating of its own volition physicalconvulsions of the type and magnitude registered naturally in recent Earthhistory. Some other cause must have arisen - a cause powerful enough to affectthe entire globe more or less simultaneously - to satisfactorily meet allrelevant criteria. Only some closely-approaching cosmic object of considerablesize could activate the titanic forces which, though part and parcel of a wider,more profound, universal uniformitar-ianism, only become naturally unleashedduring such confrontations, and would be necessary to produce such gargantuantopographical and biological changes so rapidly and extensively on Earth.The relationships between apparently incompatible uniformitarian andcatastrophic regimes of the kinds just mentioned have been shown to be extremesof what, in reality, is a single astronomical or cosmic 'norm', manifestingitself on Earth only at the times of cosmic confrontations. A question ofrelative scale is directly involved - nothing more and nothing less. In such acontext, the 'cata-strophism' and 'uniformitarianism' of previous historians isnot merely unreal, but a serious stumbling-block to a fuller and more lastingunderstanding of recent Earth historyFinally, that many ancient Deluge accounts also describe the Flood as one of theresults of a tremendous celestial conflict certainly cannot be withoutsignificance, and indicate that singular prospects now confront us at almostevery turn.Table 1CSynopsis of major global geophysical changesduring 'late Pleistocene' timesTable 1C (Continued)Synopsis of major global geophysical changesduring 'late Pleistocene' timesREFERENCES1.

Moreover, the presentdistribution of various identical or closely-allied living species, sometimesinhabiting widely-sundered land regions no longer physically connected, isseemingly contrary to their natural dissemination. These regions, therefore,must formerly have been either geographically more continuous or environmentallymore favourable to the uninterrupted spread of the biota concerned - andgeologically recently, at that. Both living and numerous lately-defunct speciesthus represent opposite sides of the same biological coin. Of these, the livingforms are the scattered descendants of biota which survived the terribledisturbances of some 11,500 years ago, whereas the extinct forms represent theannihilated victims of those convulsions.As noted previously, almost all traditional recollections of a lost primevalnorthernhomeland provide it with a marvelously equable climate and a wonderful diversityof plant and animal life, and agree that it ultimately perished in a suddendisaster of great magnitude. Also, as mentioned before, much palaeobotanicalevidence exists in northern latitudes supporting these contentions.The loss of these northern tracts naturally resulted in new topographicalconditions and a highly modified oceanic and meteorological circulationworldwide. The evidence of the fossils, therefore, is not merely an adjunct ofthis disaster, but eloquent testimony to both pre-catastrophic environmentalconditions and the awesome forces responsible for their termination.These same fossils, moreover, throw much light on the present and sometimesunexpectedly disjointed distribution of innumerable life-forms in allhemispheres. Indeed, failure to recognise a sudden terminating calamity ofgeologically recent date renders comprehension of how many existing organismsattained their present distribution extremely difficult, if not actuallyimpossible.Scrutiny of our biological coin, therefore, yields much information germane toour main theme. We begin with some of the evidence concerning still extant plantspecies from Europe and the general Atlantic region.A lost Euro-American floracv^**-;-i±*=r\"»In central Europe, lignite beds containing the remains of so-called Pleistocenemammals have been found in the north-eastern Carpathians 1 , while at Sprottauin Silesia cones of Pinus sylvestris lie alongside the bones of mammoths 2 .Remains of the same or allied conifers have also been encountered at many placesin central and southern Germany. At Leffe, for instance, Pinus occurs withlarch, hazelnut, horse-chestnut, water-nut, and an extinct tree (Juglanstephrodes) resembling the American black walnut. Remnants of conifers have alsobeen discovered at Imberg in Bavaria; alongside birch and willow in Savoy; andat Erzgebirge in Upper Saxony. In the same region, fragments of the so-calledague-trefoil have been found at Steinbach; birch and Vaccinea uliginosutn atKolbermoor in Bavaria; and those trees in company with willow, hazelnut, whiteoak, Vibernum, and a large assemblage of other plants, at Lauenburg 3 .Abundant remains of similarly aged plants including birch, willow and Polygonumhave also been found at the Swiss localities of Schmerzenbach, Bonstetten,Schonenberg, and Hedingen; while near Lake Zurich, extensive lignite bedsrepresenting luxuriant vegetation, and containing the bones of mammoth,hippopotamus, rhinoceros, bear and other contemporary animals 4 , underlie andare overlain by 'drift' deposits.Some of these lignites - known as Schieferkohle or brown coal - are so youthfulthat wood debris in them is sometimes found unmineralised, as in Styria 5 , oruncrushed, as in Bavaria 6 .Numerous central European plants in so-called Ice Age times were thus clearlywarm-temperate species hardly differing from those still thriving there today;and they were accompanied by mainly herbivorous animalsseemingly adapted to feeding on them, even though the mammoth has long beenconsidered an 'arctic' type. The apparent enigma of believedly warm and coldclimate organisms sharing common graves is repeated on virtually everycontinent.Professor Scharff once made some very pertinent remarks about Pleistocene plantsoccurring in the present Alpine region, thus:The severity of the climate during the Glacial period is often assumed from theoccurrence in Pleistocene strata of such plants as Dryas octopetala, somespecies of willow, dwarf birch, and others, which are now found in highlatitudes and in the Alps, but are, as a rule, absent from the plain of NorthernEurope. Professor J Geikie... believes... that an Arctic flora took possessionof England as soon as the climate enabled it to live in the country. Arcticplants, according to this explanation... were the first immigrants to reconquerthe dreary, plantless wastes and make it habitable for mammals.Fortunately these views do not at all agree with those of many of our leadingEuropean botanists... Professor Warming is of the opinion that the main mass ofthe present flora of Greenland survived the glaciation period in that country;whilst Professor Drude has shown that all plant life could not possibly havebeen destroyed in northern countries. He maintains that the greater part of theArctic floral elements which unite Greenland and Scandinavia must have survivedthe glacial period in these countries in sheltered localities. 7Momentarily laying aside the fact that Scharff and the undermentionedauthorities tried toexplain this botanical evidence within the framework of orthodox Ice Ageconcepts, we should note that Col W H Fielden reached the following significantconclusion regarding various Arctic plants:To my mind, it seems indisputable that several plants now confined to the polararea must have originated there, and have outlived the period of greatest icedevelopment in that region.\"Similar views about the 'pre-glacial' origin of much polar vegetation and ofwhat is commonly known as the Alpine flora were also held by the botanist JohnBall, who enquired:Is it credible that in the short interval since the close of the glacial period,hundreds of very distinct species and several genera have been developed on theAlps, and, what is no less hard to conceive, that several of these non-Arcticspecies and genera should still more recently have been distributed at wideintervals throughout a discontinuous mountain chain some 1,500 miles in length,from the Pyrenees to the Eastern Carpathians? 9Scharff, agreeing with these opinions, boldly stated:The glacial or Alpine flora is very old, and must have originated long beforethe IceAge. 10That these plants survived the supposed severity of glacial conditions haspuzzled many observers, especially orthodox glacial-ists. Many thereforeconcluded that these plants flourished outside the limits of the allegedglaciations and only later colonised Alpine areas.A notable advocate of this solution was Professor A Engler, one of the foremostnineteenth century authorities on the geographical distribution of plants. Henoted that several typically Siberian plants which today also occupy the Alps,the Caucasus and the Carpathians are entirely absent from the Scandinavianmountains, where, if anywherein northern Europe, we should expect to find them\". Alpine-like plants, however,occur in Lappland, a /ore-lying tract immediately north-east of the Scandinavianhighlands. Interestingly, Lappland hosts virtually three-quarters of all knowncircumpolar plants, and these collectively indicate that one or more land routesformerly existed between northwestern Europe and Greenland 12 . The main routewas almost certainly the aforementioned landmass of Fennoscandia.Significantly, another leading Victorian botanist, Professor F Krasan, believedthat many plants now inhabiting the high Alps flourished at sea level duringPliocene times. He stressed that:Especially the evergreen species exhibit the impression of an originally mildclimate -of a climate without winter frosts - for otherwise the plants wouldhave developed into species with deciduous leaves. 13Note that modern geology envisages the Alps as: \"...only a chain of low hillsduring most of the Pliocene\" 14 , and that, together with the Scandinavianmountains and most of the world's other major ranges, they rose to their presentelevation only during late 'Pleistocene' times.Thus, generally lower landmasses (including now-submerged tracts which thenunited regions now separated by water), together with the absence of the vastnorthern ice-sheets of conventional Ice Age theory (see Part One), not onlyencouraged more genial climates nearly everywhere, but provided almost exactlythe conditions postulated by Krasan and others, best suited for evergreenplants. These factors, in turn, again suggest geologically recent crustalchanges and a coeval shift of the terrestrial axis.To those who would ask why Alpine vegetation, if originating at low altitudesduring a climatically equable era, is now largely confined to cold Arcticlatitudes or high mountainous regions, we refer them to the eminently reasonableexplanation advanced by Scharff as long ago as 1899'\\In western Europe we find many examples of trees and plants formerly thriving atlocalities now apparently inimicable to them. In its wild state the box tree wasonce widespread in north-western France and central Europe, whereas today it isfound only around Lyons. Similarly, the grey willow, found in 'drift' depositsfrom Algeria to the depths of Germany and the British Isles, previously had amuch greater range, but is now rare in the south, occurring only near water invery damp valleys. It is, however, correspondingly abundant in the north.Considering such facts, the noted botanist Count Saporta concluded:...there has been a double retreat in opposite directions, showing that then thedifferences between the north and south of Europe were less accentuated. 1 \"It is unnecessary here to cite all the studies made of these west Europeanfloral migrations and retreats. It suffices for present purposes to referinterested readers to the works of Lubbock 17 , Geikie 18 , de Mortillet 19 , FE Zeuner 20 , R G West 21 , and Nilsson 22 , who, between them, span thedevelopment of knowledge in this particular field of enquiry and providenumerous instructive examples.Many discoveries in west European 'drift' deposits have concerned the remains oflarge maple and coniferous trees. The latter, especially, have been repeatedlyencountered in Britain. At Wawne in Holderness, for example, drainage works lastcentury exposed a buried forest, composed mainly of \"gigantic pines\" 23 ; whileothers, lying horizontally 9ft (2.8m) below ground level, in company with thebones of horse, hippopotamus, mammoth, red deer and bovids, were found nearLeeds in Yorkshire in 1852 24 . Innumerable roots of enormous size and theprostrate trunks of giant fir, oak, alder and hazel trees - complete in someinstances with leaves, berries and nuts - mixed with mammoth bones, werediscovered under thick layers of peaty-earth at low-tide level on the shorebetween Sutton and Cleethorpes last century 25 . The Rev Edward Trollope, whoreported these finds, contended that a great flood had overwhelmed theseorganisms 26 . An essen-tially similar discovery occurred at Northampton in 1859 27 .The geographical preferences of the following plants, common to western Europeand large areas of North America, also signify the former existence of at leastone land route to account for their present distribution. These plants includeCalluna, Leerzia, the sedge Carex extensa, Lobelia dortmanna, Eriocaulonseptangulare, and the water-weeds Alisma, Lemna, Potamogeton and Myriophi/llum.Of these, the first four enjoy wide distribution across western Europe.Eriocaulon, however, is restricted to colonies near the coast of Donegal andsouth-west Ireland, reappearing only on the Scottish islands of Coll and Skye.Again, the freshwater genus Naias flexilis, while present in most North Americanstreams and ponds, occurs in Europe only in south-west Ireland, Galway, the Isleof Skye, Perthshire and Esthwaite Water in Cumbria.To all these may be added the American strand-plant Spartina stricta, which, inEurope, thrives now only in south-western regions, and Scheucheria palustriswhich, although well established in Canadian bogs from Labrador to BritishColumbia, has only the most tenuous toehold in westernmost Europe 28 .Commenting upon this evidence, Forrest said:In particular, it is difficult to believe that water-weeds such as Potamogeton,Lemna, Alisma and Myriophyllum could have reached their present habitats by anArctic route. If, however, they were denizens of the lakes and marshes of anAtlantean continent in Miocene and Pliocene times, their distribution isaccounted for quite natural-ly. 29Incidentally, Forrest's Atlantean continent corresponded with Appalachia,mentioned in Part One.These and numerous similar discoveries all over Europe reveal a now largelyvanished flora which was formerly far more varied than its few survivingmembers, and which, in geologically very recent times, extended much furthernorth than it could do so today.The Saga in the Atlantic«TS%4*-;^4*ar»Turning to the former extent of analogous flora in and around the presentAtlantic, we find that they, too, occupied now vanished tracts which disappearedsimultaneously with their European counterparts. Reviewing the Atlantic floragenerally, Scharff concluded that the Azores and Madeira islands were directlyunited to mainland Europe until at least 'glacial' times 30 , by which, ofcourse, he meant down to the time of the great catastrophe under consideration.One of the plants closely studied by Scharff was the orchid Spiranthes, whichflourishes today only in North America and Ireland 31 . Spiranthes is apparentlya relict member of what has been called the North Atlantic Arctic flora, thepresent disjointed distribution of which suggests original dissemination viaislands or land-routes now far below Atlantic waters 32 .Those who doubt such explanations, and favour a comparatively great age for theAtlantic basin, are reminded that many authorities - including Prof Neumayer,and Dr von Thering 33 , Prof E Hull 34 , Dr Lloyd Praeger 35 and others - havepostulated geologically recent transatlantic connections in order to adequatelyaccount for present biological distributions, and that modern oceanographic andgeological researches testify among other things to both a temporally recentprolongation of the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco to the Canary Islands, andto an apparent western extension of Africa as far as the Azores. The fact thatAdiantum reniforme, a type of fern known to have flourished in Portugal duringPliocene times, now thrives only on the Azores and Canary islands 36 , thusbecomes explicable.Plants common only to the Atlantic islesand western Europe actually run into hundreds:There are in the Azores 480 known species of flowering plants and ferns, ofwhich no less than 440 are also found in Europe, Madeira, or the Canary Islands;while 40 are peculiar to the Azores, but are more or less closely allied toEuropean species. 37The western extremity of the transatlantic land-route passing through Madeiraand the Canaries seems to have lain in what today is the Caribbean region, whilethe route itself may have formed the northern edge of Termier's previously notedAfrico-Brazilian continent as:A connection between the flora of Madeira and that of the West Indies andtropical America has been inferred by the presence in the former of six fernsfound nowhere in Europe or North Africa, but existing on the islands of the eastcoast of America or on the Isthmus of Panama. A further relationship to thatcontinent is to be traced by the presence in Madeira of the beautiful erinaceoustree Clethra arborea, belonging to a genus which is otherwise wholly American;and of a Persea, a tree laurel, also an American genus. 38A few degrees below the equator off northeastern Brazil, the island of Fernandode Noronha bears a flora and fauna closely allied to that of the Caribbean 39 .Interestingly, the seaweeds around the island are \"related chiefly to those ofthe Mexican Gulf\" 4 \".Further south, at latitude 20°20'S, about 600 miles (960km) east of Brazil, ontheTable 2APresent distribution of some geographically isolated plants indicative of lostcontinental landmasses in Oceania and the southern hemisphereAfter Guppy, Scharff, Moseley era/Atlantic Africa IslesIndian OceanAsiaAustralasiaPacific IslandsAmericasGenus and species Type of plantifc co = = w o o| C/K/5H< _ co c CD u3 3 COo crco c/mjLUlo^pCD O CD CD Q, dj5rr52*iro£ TO T3 3 COSm2-CD 3Q. y)CO T3-„ Q - Cco |i - cw § 5 S o 3 £ m « o <Pzz<0E?3_ CO o co - j_: > « m t £ c t c 3 S S > CD CD .g ™ ^\" CO o CD CO co CO —||oi^ ^ § < c<■C .- .co« o ty>5zPringlea antiscorbuticsJuncusNerteaGeraniumSanicuiaLobelia ancepsLobelia sppSchiedeaAlsinidendronPolygonum glabrumPisonia umbelliferaHaplopetalonCouthoviaEucalyptusLuzula campestrisCoprosomaVacciniumAlyxia olivaetormisAlyxia stellataAlyxia scandensAlyxia bracteolosaAlyxia spUnciniaPeperomiaPimiaNototnchiumRichellaGeissois (7-8 species)OncocarpusBegoniaEugenia rarifloraEugenia monticolaEugenia spStenogyneWikstroemia mdicaFragaha chilensisIsodendronNothocestrumThaucombaulaGouldiaStraussiaDeyeuxiaDammara (Agathis)PodocarpusDacrydiumDianella enstolaDianella intermediaDianella spSmytheaGraefleaBroussaisiaPterotropiaBobeaKerguelen cabbageGround plantAlpine plantAlpine plantAlpine plantTree lobeliaSmall shrubsShrubShrubAquatic/semi-aquaticSeaside shrubShrubTreeTreeAlpine plantUpland plantGround plantSmall treeSmall treeSmall treeSmall treeSmall treeAlpine plantLow herbTreeSmall treeTreeSaxifragaTreeOrchidTreeTreeTreeTrailing plantTree-shrubChilean strawberryShrubSmall treeShrubTree-shrubTree-shrubUpland grassConiferConiferConiferHerbHerbHerbStraggling shrubTreeSaxifraga treeTreeSmall tree□□□ JBJ □□■ JJJ □JJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ ■JJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ □■□ JBJ ■ JJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJIII□□□■JJ JJJJJJ ■JJJJJ ■JJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJJJ JJUJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ □JJJJJ□JJJJUJJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ□□□□□□ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJJMJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJJ JJJJJJ □□□□□□ □□□□JJ □□□□□□ □□□□□□ □□□□□□ □□□□□□ □JJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ □□■JJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ■JJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ■JJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ■ JJJJ■ JIJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJII JJJJJ JJJJJ IJIJJ JJJJJJJJJJ JNJJ JJBJJ JJBJJ JJBJJ JJBJJJJJJJ JJBJJ JJBJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ■ JIJJ JJJJJ ■JJJJ BJJJJ JJJJJ■ JIJJ JJJJJ □□□■□ ■JJJJ JJJJJ JJBJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJBJJBJJJJ JBJJJ BJJJJ JJJJJ BJJJJ JJJBJ JJJJB JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJB JJJJJ BJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ ■■■JJ JJJJJ JJJJJ ■JJJJ JJJJJ JJJJJ □□□■□JJJJJ JJJJJ □□□□□ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJpicture21 [images/picture21.jpg]JJJJBJJ□□□□□□□□□□□□BJ JJJJJJBBBJJJBJ JJJBJJBJBJJJJJ JBJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJJJBJJJJBJJ □■□□■□ □JBJ JJJJJJBBBBBJJJ JJJJJJBBBBBBJJ JJJJJJBJBBJJJJpicture22 [images/picture22.jpg]JJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JBBJJJJJJJJJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJBJ JJJJBBBBBBJJJJJJJJJJJBJJJBBJ BJJJJJJBBJJJBJJJJJJJJJJJJJBJJJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJJJBJ □ □ JBBJJJI JBBJJJBJJJJJJJ JBBJJJBJJJJJJJJJJJJJBBBJBJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJBJJJJJJJ JJJJJJJJJJJJBJJJJJJJJJJJJJBJ JJJJJJJJJJJJBJ"},{"pageContent":"jaaBJJ □□□ □□□ □□□ BJJ □□□ BJJ BJJ □□□ □□□ □□□ □□□ □□□ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJJJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ JJJ BBB JJJ JJJ JJJ BJJ JJB BJJ BJJ JJB JJB■JJ JJJ BJJ BJJ JJJ JJJ BBJ JOJjjajjj jjj jjjPart Two: Prfmature Extinctionremote, virtually treeless, island of South Trinidad, abound the perished butun-fossilised remains of a species of the tree Eugenia, indicating that theisland was formerly well-wooded 41 . The present, much wider geographicaldistribution of Eugenia, shown in table 2A, is revelation-ary.Still further south, the flora of the island-group of Tristan da Cunha,Nightingale, and Inaccessible is essentially Fuegian (South American) with anadmixture of Cape (SouthAfrican) genera 42 . Moseley concluded from these details that:The close similarity of the flora of the three islands of the group points to aformer connection between them. 43Such facts point unmistakably to the rather recent existence in what is now theSouth Atlantic of one or more land routes or archipelagos over which plants hadspread both west and east.A Sunken Southern Continent?*^s^fe-jjjsjisr~»Wild plants enjoying even greater discontinuous distribution are known fromareas of the southern hemisphere now mostly occupied by southern Africa,Australasia, the southern regions of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean andSouth America. Collectively, these plants suggest the former occurrence of anow-sunken continental land-mass which embraced all these regions, and seeminglyconnected in the east with another sizable landmass in what is now the PacificOcean, and in the east, apparently, with the southern portion of theaforementioned Africo-Brazilian continent in the west.The previous existence of this great southern continent has long been recognisedby geologists and naturalists, who have given it a variety of names -Gondwanaland, Indo-Oceana and Lemuria being the best known. The now submergedPacific landmass has been variously called Oceana and Pacifica, and is ofinterest in that, as far as the botanical evidence is concerned, it wasapparently joined, either directly or via islands, to western North America.Table 2A summarises the present distribution of many of these plants, whichincludesuch well-loved forms as Begonias and Geraniums. It should be noted that, of theplants listed in table 2A, the seeds of the Kerguelen cabbage, which form theprincipal food of the local teal, are too soft and perishable to pass unharmedthrough that bird, and are very unlikely to be transported to more distantregions on the bird's feet or feathers 44 . Other plants on Kerguelen Islandalso occur in southern New Zealand, about 2,350 miles (3,760km) to the east inthe South Pacific, and on South Georgia Island, some 2,700 miles (4,320km) tothe west in the South Atlantic 45 , the overall impression being that all theKerguelen plants are actually relict species. Also of relevance is the fact thatsilicified trunks of large trees occur in late 'Pleistocene' lavas on KerguelenIsland, indicating that a well developed flora thrived there until geologicallyrecently 46 .It must be significant that the great botanist, Joseph Hooker, concluded thatthe majority of the islands of the Indian Ocean were the upland peaks of anow-submerged southern continent, thus parallelling the conclusions reached bythe naturalists who studied the floras of the Atlantic Islands and the Iberianpeninsula.Of particular interest is the fact that the shrub Pisonia umbellifera cannot bedispersed by water currents, yet it exists discontinuous-ly from Australia toTonga, while a closely related species, P aculeata, also thrives in the Americasand the Old World 47 . Again, Peperomia flourishes in such widely dispersedcountries as Australia, various Pacific islands, the West Indies and Bermuda -but while some have suggested that birds may have carried the seeds to the twolatter localities from Oceania 48 , and despite the surprisingly great powers offlight of some birds, the immense distances involved renders such an explanationdecidedly suspect. Moreover, as shown later, innumerable identical ornearly-allied species of insects, crustaceans and molluscs, which birds do notdisperse, still inhabit the same broad belt of geographically discontinuoushabitats.Hooker's conclusions respecting a former southern continent foreshadowed thosereached by Guppy years later for the Fijian area of the Pacific. Discussing thepresent distribution of the conifers Dammara, Podocarpus and Dacrydium, Guppythought that they denoted the:...original continuity of the Fijian land area, not only with the neighbouringislands of the New Hebrides and of New Caledonia, where these genera alikeoccur, but also with New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, where they attain agreat development. 49 *Interestingly, Dacrydium and Podocarpus are also known from South America 50 ,so it may be germane to mention that tree trunks, roots and branches litter theseabed between Panama and the Galapagos Islands 51 , and that others occur inlate 'Pleistocene' volcanic tuffs on Fiji 52 . Evidently, extensive forestsformerly clothed huge land areas in what today are the Indian and Pacificoceans, that these existed until late 'Pleistocene' times, and that widelyscattered colonies of Dammara, Podocarpus, Dacrydium, Eugenia and other plantson the islands now characterising these oceans represent the last vestiges of aonce far more glorious flora.Finally, the Eucalyptus tree of the Indian archipelago and Australia is, likethe trees (plane, poplar, sequoia, etc) mentioned in Part One, apparently asurvivor from Miocene/Pliocene times. In Australia, it occurs abundantly withthe cones of the southern conifer Banksia in argillaceous deposits in southernVictoria 51 . These beds have been variously dated as late Pliocene or earlyPleistocene. It will be recalled that the fern Adiantum reniforme, which stillthrives on the Azores and Canaries, lived in Portugal during Pliocene times, andthat much of the present circumpolar flora is similarly ancient.No less than seventy-seven species of living plants, some with notable Pliocene,even Miocene, characteristics, are unique to Tasmania, New Zealand and CentralAmerica 54 , so it must be of interest that sub-fossilised fruits discovered inAustralian gold-bearing drift-gravels of Pleistocene age also belong to Mioceneplants 55 . At some places in Victoria, these Australian gravels overlie theprostrate trunks and branches of large trees, some stumps still in situ, withtheir roots embedded in the original ancient soil 56 .It appears that various geologically 'old' plants still flourish virtuallyunchanged at many localities, exhibiting few or no signs of having developedinto new forms during the intervening period (millions of years, according toconventional geological chronology). Could it be that the ancient flora theyrepresent persisted right down to so-called late 'Pleistocene' times when,together with contemporary animal life of every kind, it was catastrophicallydecimated and its surviving elements obliged to inhabit (on a discontinuousbasis) the new topography occasioned by the cause of those changes? If, as iswidely agreed, the Pleistocene period ended about 11,000 years ago, it followsthat essentially Pliocene floras clothed great areas of the world until thatdate. Innumerable botanical remains encountered in 'drift' and other'Pleistocene' deposits the world over seem to suggest precisely this.The Buried Forests of North Americas-^sM-ii^^nVegetable remains entombed in alleged 'Pleistocene' deposits are known from manylocalities in Europe 57 , Africa 58 , Asia 59 , Australasia and South America 60- where so-called late Tertiary (Miocene/Pliocene) and early Pleistocene plantfossils now reposing at 13,000ft (4,000m) at Corocoro, and at 14,000ft (4,308m)at Potosi, in Bolivia, include a fern and tropical trees closely allied to thosenow living in the Amazon lowlands 61 . Such remains, however, are probably mostabundant in North America, where several spectacular finds have occurred. Wecommence with a look at some of the evidence from southern Canada.Sir William Dawson and Prof D P Penhallow 62 were among the earliest students ofCanada's so-called 'Pleistocene' floras -but while their work has inevitablybeen augmented by more recent discoveries and reports, much of what theyrecorded is highly relevant to the main theme of this book. For example, atScarborough Heights and elsewhere near Ontario, clays yielded remains of cedarand pine trees, portions of rushes, leaves, a variety of seeds, specimens ofCham, Bryuni, Fontinalis and two species of Hypnum 63 . Then, near the RiverDon, Toronto, leaves and wood fragments were discovered in dark hued clays 70ft(22m) below ground level, where, also, a Maple leaf occurred in overlyingreddish ferruginous sand, itself overlain by boulder-clay 64 . Boulder-clay alsooverlies a bed at Rolling River, Manitoba, containing shell and fish debrismixed with a great variety of plant remains 65 .At Cape Breton a hardened peaty bed, subjacent to 'till' or boulder-clay,contains twigs, branches of coniferous trees, and a great variety of fibrous andepidermal tissues, apparently of swamp vegetation indicative of a genialclimate. When ignited, these remainsburnt with a flame in the manner of lignite 66 . As noted below, lignitisedplants are actually quite widespread in 'drift' deposits over much ofeast-central Canada.Lignite occurs in or below superficial deposits in the valleys of the Albany,Kenogami, Missinaibi and Abitibi rivers between Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes.On the bed of the Kenogami it appears in association with 'till' andboulder-clay, and contains pieces of canoe birch and coniferous wood. That alongthe south branch of Coal-brook is 3ft (lm) or more in thickness, is overlain byup to 70ft (22.5m) of pebbly 'till' and gravels, and, retaining a \"distinctwoody character\", contains the flattened trunks of trees some 2ft (0.6m) indiameter.Two miles above Woodpecker Island in the same valley horizontal beds of lignite,composed chiefly of sticks and half-decayed rushes, occur in the midst of 'till'deposits 125ft (38m) thick. Three miles (5km) below Woodpecker Island lignite,as much as 6ft (1.8m) thick, extends for hundreds of yards, and consists oflaminae of moss and sticks in prodigious quantities 67 . Indeed, so numerous arelignite seams throughout this general region that lignitous matter is believedto underlie all the clays, sands, gravels and other superficial deposits,blanketing the territory south-west of James Bay for a distance of no less than200 miles (320km) 68 .The peaty and woody accumulations in the Bow and Belly river valleys of Albertaare comparable examples from western Canada, where pressure has sometimeshardened them to the consistency of lignite 69 . Further north, just below thetop soil at certain places in the valley of the Mackenzie River, shales formingthe river banks are covered with the largely undecayed leaves of very ancientdeciduous forest trees such asmaple, oak and poplar, none of which can now thrive at that latitude 70 .Various early travellers observed burning seams of lignite at several places inthe Mackenzie valley above the Bear River 71 .Faced with such evidence, it is difficult to disagree in general with thefollowing conclusion which, although formulated by Dawson and Penhallow over acentury ago, is still essentially correct:...When these plants flourished in Canada, there must have been open water and aland flora in the Arctic basin - conditions, of course, altogether incompatiblewith the existence of a polar ice-cap, although not inconsistent with theirexistence in the more elevated districts or those cooled by the cold Arcticcurrents. 72Indeed, modern observations made in Arctic Canada, militating against formerextensive ice-sheets there, strongly support Dawson and Penhallow's argument,while the evidence of the 'genial' character of many of therecorded plants merely emphasises what has already been inferred about thevanished Arctic forests. The half-decayed condition of much of the knownmaterial clearly indicates that its destruction, accumulation, and burial was ageologically recent event. As a whole, this Canadian evidence comparesfavourably with the European lignite discoveries and with the apparently coevaltestimony of the lignites at Geiseltal in Germany.As noted previously, many ancient valleys and gorges in the American Midwest lieburied under immense accumulations of 'drift' and associated materialsoriginating in more northerly latitudes, where \"Logs and fragments of wood areoften got at great depths in the buried gorges\" 73 .At Bloomington, Illinois, pieces of wood, some of it yew, were found 123ft (38m)below the surface during the sinking of a shaft 74 ; a huge log was discovered40ft (12m) below ground-level, resting directly upon 'till' or hard-pan, duringthe digging of a well at Columbia, Ohio 75 ; while elsewhere in Ohio, and alsoin Michigan, similar finds havepicture23 [images/picture23.jpg]Fig 2.1. Buried log in soil section, Shelby County, Ohio. Courtesy o/Dr R PGoldthwait,occurred. Overall, the finds have been very numerous:Buried tree-trunks are often exhumed from the glacial drift at a depth of from20-60ft from the surface. Dr Locke has published an account of a mass of burieddriftwood at Salem, Ohio, 43ft below the surface, embedded in ancient mud. Themuseum of the University of Michigan contains several fragments ofwell-preserved tree-trunks exhumed from wells in the vicinity of Ann Arbor. Suchoccurrences are by no means uncommon. The encroachments of the waves upon theshores of the Great Lakes reveal whole forests of the buried trunks of the whitecedar 76 .Buried timber resembling that of the osage-orange has been found at a depth of42ft (13m) at Coventry, Summit City, near Lake Erie, Ohio, and mineralised blackand brittle wood apparently of a cedar tree at a depth of 30ft (9m) in a similarexcavation at Ross City, also in Ohio. A 20ft (6.2m) long trunk of a whitecedar, complete with roots and portions of the upper boughs, came to light in'muck' beds 18ft (5.5m) below ground-level in Cleveland, Ohio, a district wherea layer containing abundant partly-decayed pine, spruce and cranberry leaves hasbeen repeatedly penetrated - the result being that untreated water from manywells formerly sunk there was unfit to drink. Together with twigs, leaves anddead shells, the partially rotted but unmineralised remnants of another largecedar tree were found 12ft (3.6m) below the surface at Dover, Cuyahoga County,Ohio, and 3 miles (4.8km) north of New Burlington a \"dense layer of logs\" wasencountered 30ft (9m) below the surface.Of 59 wells sunk by the early 1860's in Hamilton County, Ohio, six hadpenetrated 'muck' beds, leaves, timber or carbonaceous silt. These accumulationswere occasionally of enormous thickness. Leaves, sticks and vegetable mouldexposed in a well shaft at or near Carey's Academy, Cleveland district,comprised a layer no less than 9'2\" (2.8m) thick. In another wellnearby, a great bed of leaves and logs, this time under blue clay, was passed ata depth of 40ft (12m). This blue clay occurred in at least 35 wells sunk inHamilton County by 1864, and invariably contained logs, twigs, and leaves.An upright tree stump, complete with roots, was discovered in this same blueclay at a depth of 30ft (9m) below ground-level 8 miles (13km) east of Oxford inButler County, Ohio, while at Athens, also in Ohio, several large logs werefound 10ft (3m) lower down. Great beds of timber occur at several places inMercer County, Ohio, between 40 and 50ft (12m and 15m) from the surface, andhalf-decayed logs were quite commonly found while sinking wells on the uplandfarms in nearby Sciota County. Closely similar finds were made at varying depthsin Madison, Franklin, and Stark counties, showing that: \"...muck beds and treesare universal beneath the soil throughout Ohio\" 77 .The extent of these buried forests clearly outstretches even that of the sizablestate of Ohio. For instance, well-preserved willow remains came to light in redclay 50ft (15m) below the present surface of Lake Michigan, in a well sunk atGreen Bay, Wisconsin 78 , while further north abundant decayed vegetation hasbeen found under similar circumstances on Oak Island at the western extremity ofLake Superior 79 .Several years ago, at the site of Two Creeks, Wisconsin, abundant remains oflarge forest trees were discovered buried under deposits attributed to theMankato glacier, allegedly a feature of the supposed Wisconsinian ice advanceabout 25,000 years ago. Accordingly, these trees were initially believed to datefrom that time, but later laboratory Carbon-14 tests on spruce wood andassociated peat from the site reduced their antiquity to, significantly, only11,000 years BP 80 .Elsewhere in Wisconsin, decayed and unmineralised white cedar wood has beenfound 18ft (5.5m) down in a well shaft in Walworth County, while at Appletontownship unrotted red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) occurred at the same depth. Asecond, more decayed, specimen occurred nearby at adepth of 30ft (9m). In adjacent Minnesota, white cedar wood was discovered atthe base of sandy clay 10ft (3m) below ground-level near the Mesabi Range on thebanks of the Embarras River, and two large logs of resinous timber at a depth of60ft (18m) in a well sunk at Iowa City, in Iowa. At Burlington, also in Iowa,extensive beds of sticks and leaves have been encountered 12ft (3.6m) below thesurface - similar occurrences being recorded at various other localities westand south of that town 81 . Still more numerous finds of subterranean timberhave been made all across Illinois, especially in the counties of Jersey,Marion, St Clair, Woodford, Grundy, McLean, Morgan, Tazewell, Menard andMcHenry, and sometimes at depths of up to 110ft (34m) below ground-level 82 .Yet other finds could be listed from neighbouring Mississippi and Indiana,although the many examples just cited adequately convey the immense, andprobably more or less continuous, extent of this buried vegetation. Togetherwith the stupendous volumes of plant debris forming the previously-mentionedCanadian lignite deposits north of the Great Lakes, these discoveries west andsouth of the Great Lakes in effect constitute one gigantic raft of subterraneanbotanical rubbish - the remnants of once vast forests of mixed conifers anddeciduous timber, overwhelmed and deeply buried by whatever deposited the evenmore gargantuan volumes of 'drift' all over mid-western America and southernCanada. Before their destruction, however, these forests extended much furthernorth than is possible today.Interestingly, modern botanical research has shown that, even during allegedglacial times, the commonest tree genera in, for example, Illinois were \"presentthere during the entire Wisconsinian (Pleistocene)\" 81 , that deciduous forestssouth of the Sangamon River in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, were dense andflourished in a \"climate more humid than the present one\" 84 , and that northernplants have been identified in these buried floras of the American Midwest 85 .One authority, Griiger, has even concluded:One must assume for this region for the entire Wisconsinian, a temperateclimate, which may have permitted the survival of many plant types relativelyclose to the ice edge. 86Other botanists, concerned more with floral distribution than with geologicalhypotheses, have arrived at rather similar conclusions. Braun, for example, haspostulated ideas very similar to those advocated by Griiger on the basis ofpresent plant geography 87 , a line also adopted by litis still more recently 88. Yet others could be quoted.If, as previously advocated, the ice-sheets of glacial theory never existed inso-called 'Pleistocene' times, then the difficulties confronting botanistsstudying evidence like the above largely evaporate. Moreover, the fragile natureof much of this botanical debris -leaves, rushes, twigs, nuts, cones, berries,moss etc. - strongly militates against ice having overwhelmed and buried suchmaterial, even though the deposits enveloping it are conventionally regarded as'glacial'. The fact that equally large buried forests and delicate plants occurin Alaska and all over northern Siberia, but not in deposits usually thought tohave been laid down by ice-sheets, is highly relevant, and suggests that allthese flora, whether in America or elsewhere, perished from the same generalcause and at the same time.Collectively, the foregoing testimony of numerous living and lately-extinctplants shows not only that many flora were once far more extensive than atpresent, but also that they were so until surprisingly recently -they inhabitedlatitudes in which they can no longer flourish, and clothed a worldtopographically very unlike our own. This testimony also indicates a formerprevalence of climatic conditions considerably more genial than today. Thebotanical evidence as a whole, therefore, harmonises extremely well with theunrelated disciplines of Pleistocene geology and early tradition (see Part One).As we shall now see, the record of zoology is practically a duplicate of thatjust examined.Dislocated Faunas: the Atlantic Basin«-Vi%4*-J*J*£T\"»Like the botanists, many zoologists study-j ing the geographical dispersal ofland and freshwater animals have concluded that various land-routes orclose-knit archipelagos must have formerly occurred in many regions now belowsea level, to satisfactorily account for existing faunal distributions. Prof HSimroth, for example, investigating the slugs of the Iberian peninsula, NorthAfrica and the Canary Islands, deduced that a direct land connection between thethree areas must have existed until comparatively very recently 89 .Well known malacologists (studying molluscs) have reached similar conclusions.Thus, on the Azores, out of 69 species of land-shells (which have a naturalaversion to sea-water) 37 are common to Europe or the other Atlantic Isles.Most, if not all of them, are thought to have probably originated at thoselocalities in 'pre-glacial' days, during or even before 'Pleistocene' times 90 .They are, therefore, relict species of a fauna now drastically reducednumerically and territorially. Both Dr W Kobelt and Dr von Ihering have shownthat European, West Indian and Central American land-shells certainly impliedthe former existence of some transatlantic land-route, severed only towards theclose of the 'Pleistocene' period 91 .That such land connections really did exist seems irrevocably established by thefollowing data:The present fauna of the four archipelagos - the Azores, the Madeiras, theCanaries and Cape Verde - is not an island but a continental fauna: inparticular, the mollusc fauna is indigenous to the Mediterranean and distinctfrom the equatorial-African. At the same time, there is a resemblance in thefauna of the Canariesand Mauritania, both showing the same kind of molluscs. The earth-worms,Oligochetes, in the Canaries, are akin to the same creature in Southern Europe.It is to be concluded from these observations that in an epoch close to ours -say, at the end of the glacial period - the islands of the four archipelagoswere joined to the African continent. 92Again, Prof.Scharff noted that operculate (lidded) land-shells of the WestIndies comprise:...so large a proportion of the Antillean land-snail fauna, that a majority ofthe genera are found on two or more of the islands and the mainland, whilenearly every species is absolutely restricted to a single island, appears to meto be very strong testimony in favour of a former general land connection. 93Evidence from Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles indicates that the disappearanceof this land connection was accompanied by the near-extinction in late'Pleistocene' times of a very diverse earlier ('glacial') land-snail fauna 94 -a factor accounting for the remarkable distributional pattern of the presentsnails as noted by Scharff and, as seen below, why many of them, though nowinsular forms, are so closely related to one another. It would, moreover, not beunreasonable to conclude that the loss or subsidence of this former landconnection occurred coevally with that of the transatlantic land route calledfor above by Kobelt and von Ihering, on the basis of other molluscan evidence.Ewing, it will be recalled, indicated the awesome vertical scale, and Termierthe huge linear extent of such subsidence when, at theclose of the 'Pleistocene' epoch, large portions of the Atlantic floor - whichmust a priori have included the land routes of the naturalists - sank some 2-3miles (see Part One).Elsewhere, as between Greenland and Norway, the greater part of the NorthAtlantic subsided as much as 9,000ft. That freshwater shells inhabiting a bog atKillough in Co Down, N Ireland, are stunted forms allied not merely to somestill living in Arctic Europe, Greenland and America, but to others, almostidentical, dredged as dead shells from the Atlantic floor near Rockall off theNorwegian and Scottish coasts, the Shetland islands, Iceland and Jan Mayenisland, at depths of up to 9,000 fathoms, and generally from all areas betweenDavis Strait and Gibraltar 1 * 5 , confirms not only the enormity of thiscrustal subsidence, but supports those claims which date the collapse as havingoccurred \"since the Ice Age\"\" 6 .Elaborating upon the American and African relationships of the Atlantic islesfauna, Merezhkovsky added:...the geographical distribution of the molluscs Oleacinidae, existing only inCentral America, in the Antilles, the Canaries, the Azores, on the island ofMadeira and in the Mediterranean basin, presupposes the existence... of acontinent embracing all these regions. Fifteen varieties of molluscs live onlyin the Antilles and on the Senegal coast of Africa, and it is impossible toexplain their presence by the transportation of the embryos; while the coralfauna of the islands of St Thomas includes six varieties, of which one, apartfrom this island, breeds on the submarine rocks of Florida; while four are onthe Bermuda isles, which again can scarcely be explained by the transportationof the embryos, as their watery life is too short to allow for their beingtransported by oceans currents. 97All the land-shells of the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica aregenerally related to each other and to those of Florida and Yucatan (Mexico),whereas those from the Windward Isles are closely allied only to South Americanforms 98 . This suggests theoccurrence of a natural barrier separating the two areas represented by thesedistinct land-shell groups even before 'Pleistocene' times -a detail seeminglyconfirmed by the fact that:The fishes, shells, sea-urchins and other organisms of the West Indian basinsbelong to modern types, which to a large extent seem to have migrated from theAtlantic Ocean. Their recent appearance suggests great changes in the physicalhistory of the West Indian seas...\" (our italics)and by the recent discovery of fossils of the same species of foraminifera(uni-celled marine creatures) in sea-bed cores obtained from both sides of thePanamanian isthmus 100 . Today, these creatures are specifically distinct eitherside of the isthmus.Like many other naturalists, Spencer concluded that the submergence of theAntillean landmass and elevation of the Panamanian isthmus were geologicallyrecent events, and that much marine zoological data from the Caribbean generallyloudly echoes the implications of the land-shells of the Atlantic isles,north-western Africa and the Iberian penin-sula' 01 .Among annelids, the occurrence of similar earthworms in the Canaries andsouthern Europe represents further powerful evidence for an uninterrupted landconnection between those regions at no very remote date, for, like the slugs andmost land-shells, earthworms soon perish if consigned to sea-water. The samefate befalls similarly immersed frogs, toads and newts, yet the presence ofseveral identical or related species of these amphibians in water-sunderedSardinia, Corsica and the British Isles suggests that these islands, too, wererecently united to the European mainland 102 .The French writer, L Germain, has highlighted the fact that certain insects -such as the familiar Canary Butterfly Setomorplia dis-cipunctella - also occurin West Africa and tropical America 101 . Enlarging upon this subject, Spencenoted that:Sixty per cent of the butterflies and moths found in the Canaries are ofMediterraneanorigin, and twenty per cent of these are to be found in America... The(crustacean) Platyarthus is represented by three species in Western Europe andNorth Africa, one in the Canaries, and one in Venezuela. 104 .And Wallace said of the insects of the Azores:The butterflies, moths and Hymenoptera are few in number... Beetles are morenumerous... The total number of species is 212, of which 175 are European... 23of these are not found in any of the other Atlantic islands... Besides these are36 species not found in Europe, of which 19 are natives of Madeira or theCanaries, 3 are American, and 14 are altogether peculiar to the Azores. Theselatter are mostly allied to species found in Europe, or in the other Atlanticislands, while one is allied to an American species... Many of these smallinsects have, no doubt, survived the glacial epoch, and may, in that case,represent very ancient forms which have become extinct in their native country105 .Analogous details are traceable between the European and North American ants andbeetles. Among the Lepidoptera, for example, 243 species are common to thesecontinents, while:A great number of North American ants are identical with European ones...Northern Europe possesses one peculiar genus of Ant - Anergetes. This is closelyallied to Epoccus, another genus confined to North America... 487 species ofColeoptem are common to North America, Northern Asia and Europe. 106 .The restriction of the water-mite Hydrachna geographica - a creature withlimited powers of flight - to Europe and eastern North America 107 is stillanother example, which also parallels the distribution of the freshwater spongeHetermeyenia ryderi, thriving today only along the North American Atlantic coast(between Florida, Newfoundland, and Sable Island) and western Scotland andIreland 108 .Such distribution is inexplicable unless continuous land with freshwater lakesand ponds once existed between Europe and North America.The distribution of the pearl mussel (Margaritarm margaritifer) suggests it isanother relict species, since:The European freshwater pearl mussel is found in the United States, where otherallied species exist. In Eastern Europe and Western Asia the genus is unknown.It is widely spread in Western Europe from Northern Scandinavia to Spain -without, however, entering a single river communicating directly with theMediterranean or crossing the coastline of that ancient Central European oceanwhich extended along the northern border of the European Alps eastward to Asiain Miocene times. Its very discontinuous range, coupled with its peculiarEuropean distribution, and its absence from Western Asia, seem to imply that thefreshwater pearl mussel found its way across the Atlantic with the sponges justreferred to, at a very remote time. 1 \"\"The freshwater molluscs of Iceland and the present distribution of woodlice tella similar story:Twenty-one different kinds of land and freshwater mollusca are known fromIceland, including such well-known species as Arianta arbustorum. This is notlikely to have been accidentally introduced, and its presence in Icelandstrongly supports the idea of a former land-connection between that island andEurope. Such common European woodlice as Porcellio scaber and Oniscus asellusare liable to be unintentionally carried by man. Yet the fact that these twospecies are widely spread and apparently indigenous to both Europe and America,and are found not only in Iceland, but also in the Faeroes, is significant.Among the Iceland freshwater molluscs there is one which has probably beenderived from a former land-connection with Greenland, viz Succinea groenlandica.Itis common to both countries, yet quite unknown in Europe proper. 110As remarked earlier, abundant molluscan and other evidence obtained from thefloor of the North Atlantic indicates the geologically very late existence of aland connection between North America and western and north-western Europe, viaGreenland and Iceland. Succinea groenlandica is an excellent example of thatformer reality.This sunken North Atlantic territory which, in its time, formed much of thenow-submerged lands of Appalachia and Fennoscandia (see map IB) was also thedomain, as shown below, of many 'old' (Pliocene) molluscan biota - zoologicalparallels of the similarly 'ancient' plant species noted previously among thescarcely-fossilised botanical evidence recorded from now-inhospitable Arcticlatitudes. The freshwater character of most of these molluscs and, as noted withregard to much of the lost Euro-American flora, many of the aquatic plants,indicates that these sunken lands were well watered and enjoyed pleasantclimatic conditions - conditions vastly different from those now typical of thesame latitudes today, yet able to support comparatively delicate creatures likewater-mites and freshwater sponges.Near Billefjorden on Spitzbergen five north-dipping ancient shorelines containnumerous shells of the cold-water Pliocene mollusc Astarte borealis m , amollusc which also occurs profusely in the 'drift' deposits on Moel Tryfaen andat Gloppa near Oswestry, Wales 112 , while a contemporary thick-shelled mollusc,Cyrtodaria siliqua, although knownfrom so-called 'glacial' clays in Co Durham and Caithness, no longer thrives inBritain 113 , yet still does so in Nova Scotia and several eastern states ofNorth America.Here, then, are instances of formerly widespread Pliocene molluscs now extinctat many of their previous European habitats but still surviving in limited areasof the New World. The significance of the survival to present times of varioustypical Pliocene and Miocene plants has already been noted. This, we now see, isduplicated in the zoological record.The aforementioned Mediterranean element reappears among the 'higher' animals ofthe Atlantic islands. The lizards, for example, include a North African form anda South American (Chilean) form, but virtually all the burrowing (Amphisbaenid)lizards exhibit Mediterranean or African affinities, with a few also apparentlyhaving New World relationships 114 . The lizard Thysano-dactylus bilineatus isalso of interest as being common to Brazil and the island of Fernando de Noronha115 , these two localities also sharing the cricket genus Gryllus 116 .The present distribution of the Sirenian genus Manatus and of the Monk SealMonachus, is also peculiar. Neither of these marine mammals frequent the opensea, yet today several known species inhabit opposite shores of the Atlantic -the West Indies, western Mediterranean and the seaboards of West Africa andeastern South America. This suggests the almost inescapable conclusion that theancestors of these mammals spread along some ancient coastline uniting the Oldand New Worlds until comparatively recent times 117 .Dislocated Faunas: Eurasia, Oceania and the Southern Hemisphere«^s3*i-j**Sir-»Remaining with the Mediterranean element, but this time in the Mediterraneanitself, we find that the land-shell Buliminus pupa occurs only in Algeria,Sicily, southern Italy, Greece and Asia Minor, and that a related species,Bfasciolatus, is confined to Greece, Syria and the islands of Crete, Cyprus andRhodes. These and practically all other species of Buliminus are geographicallyvery restricted and do not survive prolonged immersion in salt-water.Conchological researches have shown that Morocco and southern Spain were alsophysically united in the recent past and that land-shells typical of those onSicily also thrive in the Tetuan Mountains just south of the Strait ofGibraltar' 18 . Further east, a whole assemblage of plants and animals was foundby the French savant Blanchard to be common to Tunisia and Sicily 114 .Among the near-endless ranks of beetles, no less than 12 species of Hopatroidesflourish in Greece and Asia Minor, and one H tlwraci-cus in Andalusia, Spain.Similarly, the related form Amphicoma is represented by 15 species in westernAsia and the Balkans, and by three others peculiar to north-west Africa andsouthern Spain 120 .Lepidopterists will know that Asia Minor hosts two of the three European speciesof the butterfly Thais, and that T cerisyi inhabits some of the Greek islands aswell as the Greek mainland and Turkey. In Europe, Greece and southern Italy arethe only habitats of the magnificent butterfly Danais chrysippus which, however,is well known from Syria, Persia and the whole of southern Asia. Interestinglythree species also occur in North America.Although at least 32 species of Bacillus, a genus to which the stick-insectsbelong, arescattered across southern Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Sandwich Islands,four additional species known from southern Europe also range into northernAfrica 121 . This distributional pattern closely resembles that of Rhax andGaleodus, two spider-like genera occupying southern Europe, North Africa andwestern Asia 122 .Crustaceans also furnish analogous details, the freshwater crab Thelphusafluviatilis being a case in point. Although other species of it occur as farsouth as Madagascar and the Cape of Good Hope and as far east as Australia, Tfluviatilis thrives in southern Spain, North Africa, Sicily, southern Italy,Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, and Persia 123 .Another freshwater crustacean, the crayfish Hemicaridina desmaresti, inhabitsSpain, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Asia Minor, while the subterranean shrimpTi/phlocaris \"is represented by three isolated species around theMediterranean\". Certain other shrimp genera typical of tropical land-lockedsaltwater pools enjoy even more exotic geographical distribution. Antecaridinalauensis, for example, is known only from the Dahlak archipelago in the southernRed Sea, the island of Europa and the Fiji islands. Similarly Ligur uvae occursonly on Aldabra Island north-west of Madagascar, Halmahera Island in Indonesiaand Fiji; while one Hippolytid genus has been recorded only from Cape RasMuhammad in southernmost Sinai, Funafuti in Micronesia and Hawaii 124 .Volumes could be filled with additional 'Mediterranean' examples of similarlydispersed insects, molluscs and crustaceans, but we must pass on to considervarious higher animals exhibiting similarly discontinuous distribution.The toad Discoglossus pictus, for instance, lives in Spain, north-west Africa,Malta, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica 125 . The ubiquitous tree-frog Hyla arborearanges from Japan, through China, Persia, Asia Minor, southern Europe, France,Spain to North Africa and is present on Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and on most ofthe larger Greek islands as well as on the Madeira and Canary islands and theSalvages. Regarding its Mediterranean distribution, Scharff remarked:The occurrence of the tree-frog on so many of the Mediterranean islands is ofparticular interest, especially as... the more minute features of the variousforms can be traced from island to island, adding one more proof - if proof wereneeded - of their former continuity 126 .Amphibians, of course, are as adversely affected by salt-water as land andfreshwater shells, so these varieties of Hyla arborea must have reached theirpresent habitats before the disruption of the landmass of which the presentMediterranean and Atlantic islands are remnants.An impressive number of reptiles enjoy a generally comparable distribution. Theworm-like lizard Blanus cinenis, for instance, lives in Spain, North Africa andon some of the Greek islands. Another lizard, belonging to the family Scincidae,thrives today on several Greek isles, as well as on Sicily, Sardinia, Spain andthe Canary Islands, while the European chameleon Chamaeleon vulgaris occurs insouthern Spain, North Africa and Sicily. Among the snakes, Periops hippocrepisis found only in Spain, Sardinia and Greece; the burrowing Typhlops lumbricalison mainland Greece and some of its islands and in Asia Minor as far as theCaucasus Mountains; and Eryx jaculus on the Greek islands of Naxos and Tinos, inTurkey and across south-western Russia 127 .Eight species of amphibians and reptiles occur east and west of the Italianpeninsula, and south of it in North Africa, but are absent from Italy itself.Forsyth-Major demonstrated the close affinities of the North African, Sardinianand Corsican forms. Out of a totalof 21 species, 12 inhabit Italy, at least 16 North Africa and 17 Spain. Fromsuch evidence he argued that Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and north-west Africaconstitute a zoogeo-graphical province from which Italy, except for a few westcoast localities, is excluded, and that:The close relationship shown in the fauna of Corsica and Sardinia to Africa,permits the supposition that the connection with these islands had persisted toa much more recent date than with Europe (our italics). 128The botanical record from the same general region is strikingly similar 129 .With their great powers of flight and their seasonal migrations, particularspecies of birds are less easy to identify positively as truly indigenous togiven geographical regions and are discussed but briefly here. Just two examplesonly need be considered. Of these, the fire-crested wren Regulus igni-capilluswhich very occasionally visits southern Britain, is common in Asia Minor andresident throughout the year in southern Europe. More importantly, it occurs inSardinia, Malta and along the shores of northern Africa. Very interestingly, tworelated species, R teneriffae and R maderensis, inhabit the Canary and Madeiraislands respectively.Our second example, the common Goldfinch, Carduelis elegans, though breedingthroughout Europe, except in the extreme north, is unusually abundant insouthern Europe and north-west Africa and has a range extending eastwards toPersia and westwards to Madeira and the Canaries 130 .Among the mammals, it may be mentioned that scattered communities of a smallrace of red deer are to be found in Corsica, Sardinia and north-west Africa 131. Fossil remains of the same deer have also been discovered in 'Pleistocene'cave-breccias - of which more shortly - on Malta 132 and Crete 133 .Natural dwarfing, apparently in response to insular conditions can, however, beachieved by some animals remarkably swift-ly. Recent research 114 has demonstrated that the red deer of Jersey, Channelislands, for example, attained their present small size in just approximately6,000 years. Several other analogous instances of rapid dwarfing among otheranimals have been recorded from other parts of the world 135 .The wild sheep of Asia Minor, Cyprus, Sardinia, Corsica and Tunisia, and theEuropean Porcupine which occurs in Asia Minor, Greece and the island of Pvhodes,southern Italy, Sicily, North Africa and Spain are analogous examples. Likewise,the small shrew-like Crocidum etrusca is found in southern France, Italy, Sicilyand North Africa (and the Cretan cave-breccias); while the Black-mouthed Weasel,Mustela boccamela, inhabits Persia, Asia Minor, Greece, southern Italy, Sicily,and Sardinia. A closely related species, M africanus, flourishes in Malta andAlgeria 136 .Additional instances abound of discontinu-ously distributed living biota in andaround the Mediterranean basin, although those already cited adequately indicatethe formerly very different arrangement of land and sea there.What then was the general extent and shape of the ancient landmass which coveredthe present Mediterranean prior to its disruption and submergence?During the Pliocene period - and probably in so-called early 'Pleistocene 'times too -continuous land united the present Balkan peninsula to Tunisia viasouthernmost Italy and Sicily 137 . Sicily itself was joined to Sardinia andCorsica and all three islands formed part of an apparently unbroken land tractstretching westward to embrace all north-west Africa, the Iberian peninsula and,perhaps, southwestern France. The Strait of Gibraltar did not exist at thattime. Professor Suess christened all this land the Aegean continent 138 , andForsyth-Major referred to it as Tyrrhenia 139 .Uninterrupted land, dotted over with freshwater lakes, also united Crete andsouthern and eastern Greece with Asia Minor and all the land as far east,perhaps, as Afghanistan. Forests covered the Anatolian district of Turkey for atleast a part ofthis period 14 \", and one or more large lakes occupied the Seistan basin ofAfghanistan down to about 9,000 years BP 141 . Others also existed then in thenorthern portion of the Balkan peninsula. Numerous 'Pleistocene' animal remainsfound throughout this huge region belong to or are closely allied to forms stillinhabiting South Africa. This detail implies that a land route occurred thenbetween southwest Asia and South Africa.The southern limits of Tyrrhenia are more conjectural although an extensive bodyof water, remembered traditionally as Lake Tritonis, allegedly divided theeastern and northwestern regions of Africa by occupying much of present westernand central-southern Sahara; but whether any direct communication existedbetween it and the shallow sea due east of Tunisia, called the Pelasgian Sea 142, is unclear. Certainly there is every indication that innumerable animal andplant species freely migrated across this ancient landmass for untold ages.Extant biological evidence admits no other sensible explanation.Like several other prehistorians and naturalists, Suess believed that Tyrrheniafoundered geologically recently - probably during early Holocene (iepost-glacial) times - and that ancient people witnessed it 143 . A goodly numberof geologists, however, have urged that it must have been an earlier (Pliocene)event largely because many of the associated fossils represent supposedlytypical Pliocene organisms. Although plausible, we have also noted that manyexisting plants and animals are essentially Pliocene survivors and that many'Pleistocene' forms were too. The actual 'age' of many Tyrrhenian species,however, may be considerably younger than commonly realised. The determinationof the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary in the Mediterranean region (the site ofthis former vanished continent) is still uncertain and has lately been muchdiscussed 144 .Shifting attention once more to the aforementioned sunken landmasses of Oceaniaand the southern hemisphere we find that:The presence of the wingless fly in both Kerguelen and Heard seems to show thatthe islands were formerly connected, which is also confirmed by the occurrenceof freshwater fishes identical with species occurring in New Zealand, Tasmaniaand the Falklands and South America. 145Clearly insufficient time has elapsed for these creatures to have evolved intoseparate species since the break-up of the great land-mass of which theirpresent habitats were apparently once a part. It will be recalled that Ball madevery similar observations about the geographically isolated Alpine flora in thenorthern hemisphere.The small land-shell shaped like a pointed round tower, Clausilia, apparentlyfirst arose in earliest Tertiary times, yet still persists today in Ireland (twospecies), southern England (four species), Spain (one species), and insouth-west Europe (where hundreds of different kinds thrive). ProfessorBoettger, who spent a lifetime studying this mollusc, recorded some 700 speciesof the genus and sub-divided it into several sub-genera. Many of theseapparently had no fossil ancestors. Furthermore, almost 100 species of thesubgenus Phaedusa still live in India, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), the Malayanpeninsula, China and Japan 146 . Today, some occupy China (Garmieria), EastAfrica (Macroptychia), Madeira {Boettgeria) and South America (Nenia), and arespread the length and breadth of Termier's Africo-Brazilian continent, mainlandAsia and various offshore islands.The land-shells of the Pacific islands paint a similar picture. Their closerelationships indicate that in comparatively very recent times the islands theynow inhabit were united as a large landmass occupying much of central Oceania147 , and which, via the Galapagos Islands, connected with northwestern SouthAmerica. The earthworms of these two last named regions are identical 148 .Innumerable other analogues abound in Oceania.Niah cave in Sarawak, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), contains the fossilremains of a large mammalian fauna whichfor the most part closely resembles that of tropical forest habitats inpresent-day southeast Asia. The fauna includes the Malay tapir (Tapir indicus)which, occurring only as a fossil in Kalimantan, Java and China, still lives inSumatra, the Malay peninsula and Thailand. Also present is the giant pangolin(Manis palaeojavanica), known previously only from the supposed 'middlePleistocene' deposits on Java, and a species of the 'ancient straight-tuskedelephant' Palaeoloxodon namadicus, which had earlier been recorded only fromsimilarly dated deposits in eastern Kalimantan 149 . Other fossils representhighland mammals like the lesser gymnure (Hylomys suillus) and the ferret-badger(Helictis orientalis), now living only at altitudes exceeding 2,000ft (615m).Here, then, in Niah cave, is a 'late Pleistocene' fauna composed of forms stillflourishing in the same general region or in neighbouring countries; or knownelsewhere solely from allegedly 'older' deposits; or which in some cases areextinct everywhere. Animals like Tapirus, Helictis and Hylomys, therefore, areessentially relict genera.The same label attaches to the Tasmanian 'wolf (Thylacinus) and the Tasmanian'devil' (Sarcophihis), two particularly savage marsupial carnivores that stillsurvive on Tasmania but which, as fossils from Australia show, enjoyed a muchwider distribution during the Pleistocene. Similarly, the sooty-opossum(Phalangista) and the brush-kangaroo (Halmaturus) are now found alive only onTasmania, whereas they were formerly contemporaries of Thylacinus andSarcophilus on mainland Australia 150 . Neither the primitive duckbilledplatypus (Ornithorhynchus) nor the spiny anteater or Echidna (Tachyglossus) likesalt-water, yet both are presently denizens of Tasmania and Australia 151 , andthe latter, with the related genus Zaglossus, of New Guinea also 152 .That dry land - which would have permitted unhindered colonisation by theseanimals - united New Guinea and northern Australia in the very recent past isnow well-established. The evidence for it includes geologically young upraisedcoral terraces on theHuon peninsula of New Guinea 153 , submerged channels on the bed of the ArafuraSea cut by bygone rivers associated with now-vanished Lake Carpentaria furtherwest on the floor of Torres Strait 154 and various hydrological changesembracing the entire Gulf of Carpentaria 155 .It can be no coincidence that, more or less synchronously with these changes,others, which among other things affected vegetation in upland New Guinea 15 ''and the Javan and Sumatran highlands 157 , occurred across the Moluccan Searegion between Celebes, the Philippines and New Guinea itself. There,approximately 11,000-10,000 years ago, there was a sudden increase in generalhumidity which, among a variety of botanical changes, promoted an abruptexpansion of hitherto seemingly rare mangrove forests 158 . Such changes castmuch light on the still discernible extent of the dislocation suffered then bythe once-continuous faunas and floras of formerly larger Indonesian andAustralian land-masses.The experience was apparently that previously noted with regard to the break-upof the inferred dry land inhabited by the surviving molluscs of the modern WestIndies.Numerous large flightless birds in the southern hemisphere are other noteworthyrelict forms. The emu (Dromaeus) and the cassowary (Casuarius) which now live inAustralia, New Guinea and variousIndonesian islands are unknown as fossils before so-called Pleistocene times 15'', as also is the case with the flightless kiwi (Apteryx) of New Zealand.Conversely, enormous now extinct populations of moas and other flightless birds,including the dangerous Harpagornis, abounded then in New Zealand; while onMadagascar the huge Aepyornis or 'Elephant-bird' was similarly common. Thecelebrated ostrich of Africa not only formerly ranged into Eurasia but waspresent in Pliocene faunas 160 and, with the flightless birds of the Pacificisland of Guam, is one of the few flightless birds now living north of theequator. Interestingly, the flightless rhea of the pampas is also known fromSouth American Pliocene 161 and Pleistocene deposits.Irrespective of the animal classes to which they belong, all the foregoingorganisms represent surviving fragments of immensely more varied faunas whichexisted until late Pleistocene times. They are the last vestiges of faunas whichhave been geographically dislocated. The distribution of these creatures isdiscontinuous in both hemispheres and highly suggestive of the former existenceof large continental land-masses across much of what are now the southernAtlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and central Oceania. The geologicallyrecent disappearance of these tracts, moreover, is seemingly confirmed by thesignificant absence of specific differentiation among any of the survivors.8A Vanished Prehistoric Ocean«-^%tj.jij<>ar-»Northwards of ancient Tyrrhenia and south-east of Fennoscandia, during timeswhich geologists have called Pliocene and Pleistocene, was an immense sea orocean of great zoogeographical significance. Formed aeons before in Miocenetimes or earlier, its waters covered areas which today are the Rhone and Rhinevalleys, northernGermany, most of central and Arctic Europe as far as the Urals, and huge tractsof Russia at least as far east as Lake Baikal and as far south as the Black andCaspian seas. This great body of water is known as the Miocene Ocean. Thedraining of this ocean was. a calamitous event which apparently attendedextensive land elevations and the demise of the Siberian mammoths and theircontemporaries. As long ago as 1866 Raphael Pumpelly discussed this vanished seaand the Russian steppe deposits as follows:The sea in which the great steppe deposit was precipitated was studded withislands now represented by the ridges and peaks which rise above the plains. Thesurface of the plains rises everywhere toward the former islands, partly becausethe deposit in its formation adapted itself partially to the original surfacesof the valleys it fills, and partly from its thickness being increased by thetributary detritus of the islands...The age of this extensive deposit is a question of much interest. If it iscontemporaneous with the steppes and terraces of the valley system of the Orkhonand Angara, it seems probable that the sea which left this deposit over nearlyall of what is now the plateau, was also contemporaneous, within certain limits,with that great body of water which, extending from the polar ocean to theCaspian, occupied all Western Siberia.The fact... that seals, identical in species, inhabit the fresh waters of thelakes Baikal and Oron... and the Caspian Sea, seems to refer to that period. TheOron lake is a tributary of the Vitim, and through this of the Lena, in which noseals occur. This circumstance points very clearly to a former watercommunication between these far separated localities, and to the time at whichthe seals of the Oron became isolated from those of the Baikal and the Caspianfalls -perhaps in the same period with the emergence of the great plains ofnorthern and western Siberia, the deposits of which are characterised byabundant remains of the mammoth as well as of Bos urus and Rhinocerostichorhinus.The closing event in the history of the great sea that in comparatively recenttimes covered so large a part of Asia, extended from the pole to the Caspian andBlack Seas, and from the Ural mountains to near the Great Wall of China, was thedisappearance of its waters from the long trough that reaches from the shores ofthe Arctic sea, through the Barabinsky steppe to the Aralo-Caspian depression.It appears to me that the ancient physical geography of this vast region, andthe effects of its elevation, present one of the most interesting and importantfields of exploration. Whether we consider the meteorological changes that musthave been brought about by the upheaval of so large an area, or the influence ofthis great water communication and its currents on the distribution of existinggenera, the geological phenomena that have affected this broad belt of the greatcontinent have, beyond doubt, had an important influence on the recent historyof our planet. 162 (Our italics).A similarly recent draining of this great sea has been advocated by, amongothers, Sjogren 161 , while the Arctic affinities of some of the denizens of itsremaining portions - for example the Caspian and Aral Seas - also apparentlyconfirm this opinion 164 . The fauna still occupying the Caspian Sea includescrustaceans belonging to an otherwise exclusively marine order, the Cumacea. Tenspecies peculiar to this body of water have been enumerated, and of others thatthrive there the minute pelagic copepod Limnocalanus grimaldi (which also occursin the Baltic Sea and Arctic Ocean), and the marine isopod related to the commonwood-louse, Idotea entomon (which has a similar northern distribution), deservespecial mention. Two species of the shrimp-like schiz-pod crustacean Mysis - Mmicrophthalma and M caspia - which are closely allied to the Arctic species Moculata, also inhabit the Caspian 165 .Scharff has noted that several kinds of Caspian fish appear to be descended fromtypical marine forms, and that the presence there of seals of the species Phocacaspica: \"...indicate that at no very distant date - at any rate sincePliocene times - a closer connection with the Arctic Ocean existed than atpresent\"\"' 6 .Broadly speaking, therefore, the present Caspian fauna is a relict marine one,very much like those of lakes Onega and Ladoga in European Russia, and likeothers in Finland and Sweden.Recent Russian studies have not only confirmed but amplified these details andthe climatic conditions under which they developed 167 .That the Caspian Sea once extended to the Aral and Black seas, and that allthree are vestiges of that ancient Miocene Ocean which bathed the northern shoreof the old Tyrrhenian continent has long been established. Certainly thesediments deposited by this huge body of water are traceable for immensedistances. They reach at least as far north as the River Kama in Central Russia,where Karpinski 168 and others have studiedthem, and they have been explored in the Yenisei valley where they containsub-fossil murine shells\" 19 .Closely similar shells have been recorded from the same sediments approximately1,500 miles (1,920km) to the west 170 , a matter of considerablepalaeogeographic importance, as many earlier authorities favoured a waterchannel between the Miocene Ocean and the polar sea east of the Urals. Thesediscoveries, however, indicated that, during the period in question, a great bayor gulf existed west of the Urals and penetrated at least as far north as theWhite Sea. From such details, Dawkins correctly deduced that before 'glacial'times: \"...the sea had already rolled through the low country of Russia, fromthe Caspian to the White Sea and the Baltic, and formed a barrier to westernmigration to the Arctic mammals of Asia\" 171 . Map 2A shows the probabledisposition of land and sea in Eurasia at that time.Mediterranean Graveyardss-v***-?***«r»A ttending as it did the break-up of much of ./~\\jyrrhenia and the elevation totheir present heights of all the major European and Asiatic ranges, the drainingof the old Miocene Ocean was sudden, violent and catastrophic. The displacementof its waters, in fact, constituted a disaster of the first magnitude. In fewregions are the effects of this displacement more riveting than at variousplaces around the present Mediterranean basin. Especially remarkable are thecaves and fissures.After exploring the Sicilian cave of Maccagnone, Dr Hugh Falconer reported:...the cavern had been filled right to the roof, the uppermost layer consistingof a concrete of shells, bone-splinters, withburnt clay flint-chips, bits of charcoal and hyaena coprolites, which wascemented to the roof by stalagmatic infiltration... of contemporaneous origin...A great physical alterahon... occurred to the conditions previously existing,emptying out the whole of the loose, incoherent contents, and leaving only...portions agglutinated to the roof. The wreck of these ejecta being visible inthe patches of ceneri impastati, containing fossil bones, below the mouth of thecavern. 172Elsewhere in Sicily, in the hills around Palermo, veritable hecatombs ofhippopotamus bones have been found. As much as:Twenty tons of these bones were shipped from around the... cave of San Ciro,nearPalermo, within the first six months of exploiting them, and they were so freshthat they were sent to Marseilles to furnish animal charcoal for use in sugarfactories... The bones were those of animals of all ages down to the foetus, nordo they show traces of weathering or exposure. 173The freshness of these bones and the presence of very young individuals showsthat some sudden and geologically recent cataclysm was responsible for theiraccumulation. In Prestwich's opinion the causative agent was an immense floodwhich, at its nadir, submerged the British Isles, the whole of Central Europeand the Mediterranean islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Malta.Reconstructing the event, Prestwich wrote:The animals in the plains of Palermo naturally retreated, as the watersadvanced, deeper into the amphitheatre of hills until they found themselvesembayed... the animals must have thronged together in vast multitudes, crushinginto more accessible caves and swarming over the ground at their entrance, untilovertaken by the waters and destroyed... Rocky debris and large blocks from thesides of the hills were hurled down by the current of water, crushing andsmashing the bones. 174Prestwich also added that it was: \"...impossible to account for the... phenomena...by any agency of which our time has offered us experience... The agency,whatever it was, must have acted with sufficient violence to smash the bones\"175 .Among the animals found at Maccagnone were hyaena, lion, a large bear and theancient straight-tusked elephant (Palaeo-loxodon antiquus). These flourishedalongside the aforementioned hippopotami, one of which (Hippopotamus pentlandi)was a dwarf form also known from coeval deposits on Malta, Crete, mainlandGreece, Cyprus and in the cave of Santa Teresa near Spezzia in northern Italy176 .Abundant remains of full-sized hippopotami have also been discovered in otherSiciliancaves and rock-fissures 177 , habitats hippopotami now seldom frequent. Theiroccurrence in caves and fissures, frequently too small to accommodate even oneindividual, is mystifying until it is realised that these animals did not livewhere their bones now repose but were transported en masse to these sites frommore distant localities.Also of much interest was the discovery in a cavern at Luparello, near Palermo,of the bones of a dwarf species of Palaeoloxodon, P mnaidriensis 178 , a formbetter known from specimens found on Malta 179 .The old torrent bed of Benghisa on Malta abounds in breccia-filled fissures.Excavated last century these produced irrefrangible evidence that the brecciasand the innumerable bones they contained had been deposited under exceptionallyviolent conditions.Among the large blocks of fresstone, either impacted or strewn in aheterogeneous manner, were lying seemingly entire skeletons of elephants, someof the skulls and jaws furnishing good evidence of the rough usage they hadsustained by being broken and crushed flat by blocks which, with the force ofimpact, had cracked the others on which they impinged. These conditions werebeautifully illustrated in the cases of thigh and pelvis bones, which had beensmashed to pieces by blocks falling on them... Entire skeletons of the dormice(of a gigantic extinct genus) were found between blocks as if their bodies hadsunk into the hollows as they floated past, whilst fragments of large birds'bones and traces of a huge fresh-water turtle, and several vertebrae and skullsof lizards, as large as a chamaelon, were found in conjunction with...land-shells... the appearance presented by this remarkable collection of organicremains seems... to indicate that water at one time flowed down the gap, and wassubject to occasional extraordinary deluges which bore down the large blocks andwhatever exuviae came within reach 180 .Dolomieu, an early observer, concluded that a great wave had passed over Malta,overwhelmed its animal denizens and washed off all its superficial soil (whichaccounted for the island's bare aspect) 181 . Admiral Spratt later reachedsimilar conclusions 182 . Like the Sicilian bones, the tortoise and turtleremains found in these fissures appear to have been conveyed thence from someother unidentified locality by a large body of water which: \"...at one timeoverflowed the greater portion of the eastern half of the island\" 183 .Dr Leith Adams concluded that this deluge proceeded from a northern direction184 , that it had cast whole carcasses into the fissure at Mnaidra, and that,due to the exceptional freshness of their bones, many animals had been entombedin the flesh, albeit in dismembered condition 185 . This applied particularly tothe remains of pygmy elephants which, as with the Sicilian hippopotami,represented individuals of every age from infant to adult 186 :In a little crevice in the eastern wall of the Mnaidra Gap in Malta not threefeet either way, among enormous quantities of fossil land-shells, lay the twodetached lower jaw bones of possibly the smallest of the two pygmy elephants,and under them portions of the spinal column with ribs in situ... The finding offragments of pubic bones, and of vertebrae in their natural order of succession,and in a linear direction, shows clearly that there must have been several ofthe elephants introduced in the flesh. 187 [Our italics].As previously seen, similar dismemberment characterised many of the coevalfaunas now occupying the Alaskan 'muck' beds and we shall encounter them againsporadically over huge areas of Eurasia, North and South America andAustralasia. These animals were not dismembered by natural predators, but bysomething acting just before or during their burial on quite literally ahemispheric scale.Significantly, pygmy elephants, which appear to have been so prominent in theland fauna of the Tyrrhenian landmass, today only exist in the Congo basin.Similarly, the only living pygmy hippopotamus, Hippopotamus liberiensis, is nowconfined to West Africa.The aforementioned gigantic dormice of Malta tell a parallel story. Adamsobserved that:...their wholesale destruction at all ages of their existence, from the new-bornto the aged (was clearly synchronous with) the wholesale destruction of thepachyderms... The rationale of finding such vast quantities of dormice andbird's bones, either... in fragmentary states or... entire, along with uninjuredbones of elephants, or below or between blocks of stone in the old torrent-bedof Benghisa, together with their presence in almost every similar ossiferousdeposit in the islands, seems to me conclusive that they cannot be accepted asrepresenting the usual casuals from natural decay, but when taken in conjunctionwith what has been previously stated, they afford very strong circumstantialevidence that the extinction of the land fauna of the period was brought aboutby changes in the physical geography of the area... 188 .Excavations conducted a few years later by A A Caruana in the Maltese fissure ofIs-Shantiin revealed similar indiscriminate exterminations. Many 'Pleistocene'elephant bones and molars, including one of a pygmy species, were found mixed upwith numerous bird bones and sharks' teeth. Caruana offered the standardexplanation that the shark teeth had been derived from an earlier (Miocene)deposit scoured away by massive water action 189 - marine deposits abounding atsome localities with teeth like those from Is-Shantun.Miocene sharks were the largest which ever lived, and included the monstrousCarcharodon, one species of which, possessing distinctive triangular teeth up to8\" long, may have had a 6—7ft wide jaw gape, and probably attained a length of80ft 190 . Significantly, several smaller species of Carcharodon persisted downto late 'Pleistocene' times, and one, in effect still a 'Miocene' form,continues to do so off the eastern coast of Asia 191 . Very interestinglytherefore, non-fossilised teeth, 5\" long and larger than in any known livingshark, andessentially identical to those of the Miocene species, have been dredged up fromthe sea-floor off Australia. They represent a shark which, according to Dr DavidStead, must have been \"80-90ft long\" 192 .Now, while Caruana's suggested origin of the Is-Shantiin shark teeth isconceivably correct, there is - because 'Miocene' sharks have survived down toour era - no longer any valid reason to regard the Is-Shantiin cave specimens asnecessarily older than the 'Pleistocene' deposits which yielded them -depositsaccumulated at a time when, as shown above, species of Carcharodon certainlyexisted. Might it not be, therefore, that the absence of other Miocene fossilsat Is-Shantiin signifies that these sharks had, as living Miocene 'survivors',been swept out of the concomitantly emptying Miocene Ocean located north ofTyrrhenia and buried alongside contemporary land animals destroyed with them? Inthat connection it must surely be relevant that remains of great fish lie on andin the permanently-frozen Siberian deposits enclosing the debris of countlessFig 2.2. Carcharodon shark-jaws. Original in the Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.picture24 [images/picture24.jpg]'Pleistocene' land animals, including the aforementioned refrigerated mammothand rhinoceros carcasses, and that various rock fissures in the Jura mountainsand along the north coastline of the present Mediterranean are filled withfossils of Pliocene and 'Pleistocene' marine organisms 193 .We have already noted that Tyrrhenia, apparently submerged at the end of'Pleistocene' times - or even in earliest Holocene times' 94 : the equivalent ofForrest's \"since the Ice Age\" dating for the disappearance of ancient Atlanticlandmasses - was well populated by a great variety of 'Pleistocene' and Plioceneanimals. The repeated parallelling of so many disparate details on anear-hemispheric basis within the same segment of time is surely not fortuitous.Fissures in the side of a barren, truncated mountain, having a base a mile incircumference, situated near the village of Cerigo, on the Adriatic island ofthat name, contain a veritable graveyard of bones. Known locally as the'mountain of bones', this eminence is covered from its base to its summit, bothwithin and without, by the remains of a wide range of 'Pleistocene' animals 195. Exactly as for the aforementioned Sicilian and Maltese evidence only aqueousaction on a gigantic scale can account for such colossal bone accumulations.Crete is another Mediterranean island in places honeycombed with limestone cavesand fissures, yielding the bony remains of a large and interesting 'Pleistocene'fauna. This included rodents and pygmy elephants, from a cave near Cape Maleka,bones, horns, and teeth of antelopes and deer from a cavern on the promontory ofKutni ,9b , numerous rodent bones from a cave at Sphinari, and fragments ofpygmy hippopotami in a hillside cave near Melato. Remains of similar animals,together with those of ruminants and a species of elephant occurred in anotherin the Bay of Kharoumis 197 . Widespread water action has been advocated for theextinction and burial of all these animals 198 .A very similar story unfolds in the western Mediterranean. Late 'Pleistocene'bone-breccia in caves and fissures on Corsica, Sardiniaand the Balearic islands contain the fossil remains of a wide variety of animalsthat, in many instances, are actually typical late Tertiary (Miocene andPliocene) forms. Indeed, when these fossils were first studied it was supposedthat the breccias were likewise of Tertiary date 1 \"\", but subsequent studies ofsome of the rodents and molluscs disclosed their undoubted 'Pleistocene' age 2 \"0 . Once again, therefore, we find - on these islands - an ancient (Tertiary)fauna persisting down to the close of 'Pleistocene' times.The event which submerged Tyrrhenia and choked caves and fissures on theaforenamed Mediterranean islands with animal remains also visited North Africaand the Iberian peninsula, similarly overwhelming the contemporary('Pleistocene') fauna and flora there. Thus, remains of Palaeoloxodon have beenfound in Algeria 201 , and at Tangier 202 , and those of the enormous 'southernmammoth' (Archidiskodon meridionalis) at Man-soura 210 . Bones and teeth ofhippopotami have been unearthed near Constantine and elsewhere in Algeria 204 ,others of the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta tichorhinus) at Chetma near Biskra205 , and those of its constant companion the hairy mammoth (Mammuthusprimigenius) near Oran 206 . Among other Algerian fossil proboscidean remains,are some apparently of the living African elephant, Loxodonta africanus 207 , anunexpected occurrence also parallelled in South African 'Pleistocene' deposits208 .This Algerian 'Pleistocene' fauna also included various gazelles 20 \", severalcervids like those known from the Corsican fissures 210 , a series of bovids -including Bos (Bubalus) antiquus from Djelfa and Setif 211 -and a number ofhorses 212 . Of the latter, one, although occurring in 'Pleistocene' deposits,strongly resembles the defunct Pliocene horse Equus stenonis 2n , and anotherpossesses teeth reminiscent of those of the earlier Miocene horse Hipparion 214. Interestingly, Hipparion has been found elsewhere in undoubted late'Pleistocene' deposits 215 . Once again, therefore, the evidence suggests thesurvival in north-west Africa during late 'Pleistocene' times of very ancientanimal forms whichhad died out elsewhere, but which were there living alongside a rich variety ofanimals of more modern character.North of Morocco, the 1,370ft (422m) Rock of Gibraltar is extensively fissuredand displays old beach lines now some 600ft (185m) above present sea level. AsPrestwich once observed, the Rock was:...in Quaternary times, an island not more than 800ft, or less, high, which roseby successive stages to its present height. It is more than probable, however,that at some time before it settled at that level, the whole of the area wasupheaved to such an extent that a land passage was formed to the African coast.216Bones or portions thereof fill these fissures and represent:...panther, lynx, caffir-cat, hyaena, wolf, bear, rhinoceros, horse, wild boar,red deer, fallow deer, ibex, ox, hare, rabbit... The bones are most likelybroken into thousands of fragments - none are worn or rolled, nor any of themgnawed, though many carnivores then lived on the rock... A great and commondanger, such as a great flood, alone could have driven together the animals ofthe plains and of the crags and caves. 217Captain Frederick Brome, one of the principal collector of these remains (whichalso included many species of birds) reached similar conclusions:The scattered, broken state of everything found, together with the fact that theobjects were almost invariably discovered near and under the sides of the cavernand passages, appears to me to indicate that these appearances would only havebeen caused by some convulsion accompanied by flood 218 .Nor were the bones rolled or water-worn, and very few showed signs of havingbeen gnawed. They looked, in fact, singularly fresh despite their splinteredcondition with-J*>\"«' i 2*«4picture25 [images/picture25.jpg]picture26 [images/picture26.jpg]'.Jfe »■£ \"oT3 n3 S J* 60 4j1} <fl <s>oi 2 -^\" \"9 3'J i o!; cwS ° T3■» £ tCo?'2 &3£ - *<° r \"S* S 3Si . 2 ■5E Si.2 &•U x> <oC tu nU Xj re5 > u8 2 IBa. f> ■a coX> ^ £:G 3 3r- O 3D, 01 >IB C Sh C Qjo c _>,o x \"Hbtilib aj2 <&5noin the breccia 21 \". Significantly, land and marine shells occurred at alldepths down to 290ft (89m) below the surface in one of the fissures (Genistano:l), which also yielded pieces of coral 220 . Tons of bones were retrievedfrom these fissures, but were afterwards largely dispersed and lost to science221 .Although a few of the originally excavated pieces of bone breccia from Gibraltarhave survived, a handful of examples may yet be examined in the Natural HistoryMuseum in London and the geological collections atSalisbury, England, and confirm the reported freshness of the remains embeddedin them. Later excavations of other Gibraltar caves by, amongst others, DAEGarrod, A Craven Greenwood, R Wilson and J Waechter testify to the consistentlyunrolled and fresh appearance of the bones from all the caves explored, and thegeneral accuracy of the above-cited observations of Prof Prestwich and CaptainBrome - that is, diluvial not glacial action produced these accumulations.10 Subterrranean CharnelhousestTs^jfe-j-iijsr*Approximately 11,500 years ago the shat-jtVtered remains of countless'Pleistocene' (Ice Age) animals (sensu lato) and plants were deposited bothnorth and south of the equator, in limestone caves and rock-fissures like thosejust reviewed. Usually featuring several chambers, these caves, via narrowfissure-like tortuous passages, often penetrate solid rock for horizontal andvertical distances sometimes exceeding several hundred feet, are intersected byseparate fissure systems (fig 2.4), and are globally very numerous.Most of the remains retrieved from these apertures have been deposited in greatconfusion, with normally incompatible kinds of animals lying in unnaturallyclose juxtaposition. Often accompanying these organic masses are both roundedand angular stones of dissimilar composition and, less frequently, sizableboulders. All these objects are usually enveloped and united by consolidatedmuds, earths or hard breccias, although at Mont de la Moliere near Estavayer inSwitzerland, at Kropp in Carniola and elsewhere, they are directly associatedwith iron-ore deposits 222 . In another case a nearly-complete rhinocerosskeleton has been found lying in a vein of lead at Dreamy Hole, Derbyshire,England 223 .In effect, these sites amount to underground charnelhouses, and, as previouslynoted around the Mediterranean basin, their testimony is important.As present space limitations prevent reference to more than a tiny fraction ofthe total number of known sites, a small selection of typical Old and New Worldexamples must accordingly suffice.Bone-caves have been explored for well over 200 years, among the earliestBritish examples being a series of three at Oreston near Plymouth. The first ofthese, opened in 1812, contained numerous much broken but unabraded rhinocerosbones. The second, a smaller affair discovered in 1820, yielded mixedrhinoceros, bear and deer bones, while the third, excavated in 1822, wasconsiderably larger and contained, in addition to still more rhinoceros remains,huge numbers of bones representing a wide range of other coeval mammals 224 .Table 2B compares the Oreston animals with those found a few years later insimilar deposits in Ash Hole cave at Berry Head, in Brixham Cave and in Kent'sCavern, Torquay,Table 2BAnimals found in cave-deposits, Devon, England(after Buckland, Busk, Pengelly, Hodge, Boyd-Dawkins, and others)England. The lists provide a good basis for comparison with analogous cavediscoveries elsewhere.Like those from the aforementioned Sicilian and Maltese sites, these South Devonremains, and especially those from Kent's Cavern, had:...suffered considerably from pressure, after having first undergone violencefrom the force which impelled and congregated them in this narrow creek. Theywere found driven into the interstices of the opposite wall, or piled in thegreatest confusion against its side 225 .As in the Mediterranean region, these British sites revealed young and oldanimals of many normally incompatible species entombed together, no singleindividual being preserved entire and the majority in an exceedingly fragmentedcondition. Many bones have also been found jammed into the furthest recessesof these caves, which sometimes occur several hundred feet from the cave'sentrance.Other British bone-caves and fissures of note occur on the Isle of Portland inDorset 226 ; Durdham Down near Bristol; in the Mendip Hills, Somerset 227 ; atCresswell Crags 228 and Windy Knoll 224 , both in Derbyshire; at the south endof Kirkdale, Yorkshire 23 \"; on the Gower peninsula 211 , Caldy Island andaround Tenby in south Wales 232 ; and the Vale of Clwyd, north Wales, wheregreat accumulations of red clay invaded the cave at Cefn so forcefully that itploughed up its original floor 233 . The bones in this cave belonged to mixed'northern' and 'southern' animals -the 'northern' forms being represented by thebison, reindeer, and woolly rhinoceros and the 'southern' species by the ancientstraight-tusked elephant (Palcieoloxodon antiquus), the round-nosed rhinoceros{Dicerorhinus hemi-toechus), and Hippopotamus major™.It is unquestionably significant that one of the foremost investigators of theCefn cavesconcluded that, during the 'drift' epoch, they had been submerged 235 . A marineinvasion has been postulated to explain a similarly disturbed cave floor at CaeGwyn near Denbigh 2111 . Even in Eire analogous discoveries have occurred, therelevant phenomena again being attributed to water action 237 .Virtually indistinguishable from their British counterparts, numerousbone-caves, fissures and ossiferous breccias occur in continental Europe, beingespecially well developed in the limestone districts of France and Germany.Some, like the cave at Gailenreuth near Bayreuth (fig 2.4), have becomeinternationally famous. Indeed, first explored in the late eighteenth century,Gailenreuth cavern was the earliest to be studied scientifically 218 and itbecame the standard by which all later similar cave discoveries were compared.Buckland's splendidly graphic description of this cave and its contents 23 \"clearly indicates that water, operating violently and tempestuously, had carriedall the remains into the cavern and deposited them irregularly. Buckland'sreference to the congeries of 'agglutinated' bones is especially noteworthy, asduplicated effects have sometimes been encountered in bone-caves elsewhere.Other important German bone-caves occur at Kostritz 240 , Kuhloch 241 , and inthe Hartz Mountains (Biels' Hohle and Bauman's Hohle) 242 , where the results offormer powerful water action are again evident.Of the many known French bone-caves and fissures, the 1430 foot (440m) high'Montagne de Genay', located north-west of Semur in Burgundy, is a particulailystriking example, the deposition of its bone-breccia capping being, inPrestwich's opinion, \"an act of short duration\" 243 . Other noteworthy Frenchbone-fissures occur at Pedemar and Santenay. From the latter, various remains oflion, bear, wolf, fox, giant ox or bison, horse, lynx, Rhinoceros merckii and'Cervus' elaphus var canadensis have been recorded lying in the wildest disorder244 . In this assemblage of mixed 'northern' and 'southern' animals, the horseswere exceptionally large and the wolves unusually abundant 245 . The presence ofthe Canadian species of deer, known too from several other west European sites,is also interesting.Bone-caves and fissures in the French maritime departments of Aude and Gard 246have yielded analogous evidence, as have those located in the escarpmentsbordering the Rhone valley from Doubs in the north 247 to Montpellier in thesouth 248 . The animals found at these sites include species present in thecave-breccias of Gibraltar and the railway cuttings at Mentone, Baousse-Rousse,and near Antibes, dug in 1870 24 \".At Nice, fissure deposits contained remains of yet extant land-shell, lizard,snake and tortoise species, and the bones of hairy mammoths, woolly rhinocerosesand extinct bears 250 . Other caves and fissures on the famed Cote d'Azur haveyielded mixed terrestrial and marine organic debris. One such was Vallonet caveat Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, between Monaco and the Italian border, where bones oflions, rhinoceroses, hyaenas, macaco monkeys, elephants and, most significantly,whales came to light 251 . Whales and remains of marine creatures do not getinto caves and fissures unless washed into them by masses of water.Italy continues the story, for bone-fissures and caverns in the hills ofPiedmont, Liguria 252 and Tuscany, have disgorged a fauna: \"...notdistinguishable from that of Gibraltar\" 253 , while generally similaroccurrences of land-shells and animal bones abound in breccias at Verona,Vicenza, and other places in the southern foothills of the Italian dolomites 254.In neighbouring Croatia, bone-caves in the Julian Alps 255 , around Trieste 256, in the Pivka basin (Slovenia) 257 , and along the Dalmatian coast 258 , haveyielded a variety of 'late Pleistocene' mammals of considerable interest. Thus,in a cave near Cmi Kal, remains of the comparatively rare Dicerorhinuskirchergensis have been found 259 , while Vjetrenica cave has produced bones ofthe leopard 260 . Eastwards in Croatia, the mountain of Ischuber features abreccia containing numerous bones of bears 261 , contemporaries of other'Pleistocene' cave-bears and lions found in the cave earths of inland Bosnia andHerzegovina 262 .Cave-bear remains also abound in several ossiferous caverns at Peggau, nearGraz, in Austrian Styria 263 . The faunas from these andother Austrian bone-breccias 264 compare well with those from fissurespenetrating limestone strata to depths of 720ft (221.5m) or more below groundlevel in Carniola, where bones of cave-bears and other mammalian carnivores werefound to predominate 265 .The celebrated Dragon's Caves near Mixnitz, Austria 266 , various Bohemian(Czech) bone-caves 267 , and others in the Tatra Mountains near the Polishborder 26 *, have yielded many coeval animal bones, while in Poland itself, anotable assemblage of 'late Pleistocene' rodents has been found in a cave atNietoperzowa 269 .Completing our brief survey of this remarkably abundant European evidence, weshould mention that in the Zakarpat district of Belarus, close to the Slovakianborder, remains of a hairy mammoth, cave-bear, hyaena and other 'latePleistocene' animals have been discovered in the bone-caves of Charitch, andthat the cave-breccias in the Zhiguli Mountains near Kybyshev contain aprofusion of comparably-aged bird and mammal bones 270 . Yet other breccia- andbone-filled caverns occur in the western foothills of the Ural Mountainsresemble the examples just mentioned.In continental Asia, shells and bones of elk, bison, and other 'northern'animals occur profusely in breccias occupying caves and fissures near Beirut,Lebanon 271 , while remains of late 'Pleistocene' elephants, the woollyrhinoceros and Bubalus (the Indian water-buffalo), mixed with those of'southern' animals, have been found in the cave of Ksar'Akil, Syria 272 . Whatthese supposed 'northern' species were doing so far south has never beenproperly explained. The fact that allegedly 'northern' forms - bison, bear and avery large feline - have been found even further south in Israel 273 , merelyemphasises the error of the usual interpretation that these mammals were Arcticanimals.Immense quantities of 'Pleistocene' animal bones closely resembling those fromaforementioned European caverns and fissures have been excavated from numerousbone-caves in the Altai mountains of central Asia. They include such interestingforms as mastodon, giant camel, gazelle, saiga antelope, giantbeaver and ostrich 274 , and are reminiscent of others from parts of inlandChina and Korea, which are riddled with fissures and caverns closely packed withshell and animal remains analogous to those we have just discussed.Close to the village of Choukoutien, near Peking, a series of interrelatedbone-caves and fissures discovered earlier this century has yielded informationof great scientific importance. They contained some surprising anomalies,whereby typically 'late Pleistocene' animals occurred in the lower bedsalongside representatives of 'old' faunas, while the reverse situation wassometimes met with in the upper beds. Moreover, in almost all instances andirrespective of whether they belong to 'old' or 'newer' types of animals, thebones were unabraded and looked amazingly fresh.Among the animals found were a great variety of rodents, a porcupine, at leasttwo species of hyaena, the wolf, fox and Cyon, a very large sabre-toothed cat,tiger, leopard, and other felines, brown bear, cave-bear, two-horned rhinoceros,woolly rhinoceros, big-horned sheep, an animal allied to the musk-ox (Boopsissinensis), the pig, hare, deer, a horse, a camel, several kinds of bovids(including Bubalus), Cynailurus, a large elephant like Palaeoloxodon antiquus,the baboon, the ostrich, and a species of tortoise 275 .Viewed collectively, these animals reflect an extraordinary range of habitatsand climatic conditions, and resemble the mixed faunal assemblages noted allover Europe. Thus, there were animals typical of jungles or warm-moist climates,of tundras or cold-wet climates, of prairies and steppes or dry-temperateclimates, and of semi-desert or hot-dry climates.At least one cave at Choukoutien contained a puzzlingly high number of completeskeletons of normally incompatible animals - hyaena, horse, tiger, Cynailurus,red deer, Viverra, and so on 276 . These suggested that, like some of theirEuropean contemporaries, these particular individuals were interred in theflesh.One of the most unexpected discoveries at Choukoutien concerned the fracturedremains of seven human beings squeezed into a fissure or narrow cave.Representing European, Melanesian and Eskimo racialtypes these aroused immediate interest 277 . Initially, it was assumed thatthese individuals had been murdered aeons before, as their skulls were badlysmashed. This, however, begged the question of how or why such diverse racialtypes congregated simultaneously (demonstrated by the close juxtaposition oftheir skeletons) at a locality now far removed from their respective habitats,or came to lie in deposits enveloping similarly diverse animals.If, however, tumultuous water-action was the entombing agent, then thesefaunally and climatically incompatible animals and humans, and the suspectedcomplete carcasses, amount to oriental analogues of those ascribed to anidentical cause in Europe and the Mediterranean basin.Finds in a limestone cave near Reijo, Korea have included late 'Pleistocene'rhinoceros and horse remains of exceptional size 278 , like those previouslynoted in the Santenay cave breccia. Interestingly, similar very large horsebones have been discovered in North American 'drift' deposits too.Evidence clearly echoing all this has come to light in various Australian caves.Ice-sheets like those advocated by orthodox glaciologists were, of course,conspicuously absent from Australia, so this evidence is especially significant.It occurs, for example: ...in caverns... at Wellington; at Boree; near the headof the Colo river; at Yesseba, on the Macleay river; at the head of theCoodradigbee; not far from the head of the Bogan, and in other places. 279Commenting on the Wellington valley bones, Lang observed:Frequently these occur so fixed between large rocks that it is quite impossibleto get them out; and indeed, in general, none can be got in an entire state fromthe matrix, being in their embedded state full of fractures; ...the bones werein... abundance, and generally upright... the animals that owned these bonescould not have died a natural death, for most of them have evidently beensubjected to great vio-lence, and exhibit fractures in every direction. 280A contemporary authority stressed the singular mode of burial of these remainsthus:They are not found in any regular position, such as would be imagined had theirowners lived and died where their remains now lie. Heads, jaw-bones, teeth,ribs, and femurs are all jumbled and concreted together without reference toparts. The quantity of small animals it must have taken to form a deep depositof their bones, perhaps two feet deep, ten wide, and of indeterminate length,must have been something prodigious, for they are compressed into the smallestpossible space and must have decomposed from exposure... No entire skeleton hasbeen discovered, and very rarely were any two bones of the same animal foundtogether. On the other hand... from the nearly natural position of the smallerbones in the foot of a Dasyurus, it can scarcely be doubted that this part ofthe skeleton was embedded in the cement when the ligaments still bound the bonestogether. The united radius and ulna of a kangaroo are additional evidence ofthe same kind; and yet, if the bones had been so separated and dispersed andbroken into minute fragments, as they now appear in this breccia, while theywere still bound together by ligaments, it is difficult to imagine how thatcould take place under any natural process with which we are acquainted... thebest specimens of single bones have been found wedged between huge rocks, wherethe breccia is found like mortar between them, in situations eight or tenfathoms underground. 281 [Our italics].Here, then, in these Australian caves we find precisely the same scenario asexists in the Eurasian equivalents - namely, that countless assorted animals(including some apparently dismembered while still in the flesh) were entombedchaotically and violently and crowded unnaturally into small rock cavities andcrevices; the principal difference being that the Australian animals are notenvisagedas 'northern' or Arctic species, whereas their European counterparts commonlyare, and their burial attributed to ice-action.Also noteworthy are the great depths at which some Australian finds haveoccurred. These rival many recorded from Europe. Thus, in bone-caves atCoodradigbee, emu remains were discovered over 200ft (61.5m) below ground level282 . In Australia the burial of remains at such depths is surely consistentonly with tumultuous water-action on a huge scale. The 'agglutinated' conditionof numerous bones in rock-crevices and bone-caves around Chudleigh, Tasmania 283, suggests a similar causal agent, as in fact do the enormous accumulations ofextraordinarily fresh-looking moa remains in various New Zealand caves, atseveral of which (eg Earnsclough, Otago and Manuhirikia), moreover, specimenshave been found with sinews, muscles and dried flesh still attached 284 .Essentially identical evidence has been reported from South America. Numerouslimestone caverns scattered across the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo, MinasGeraes, Goyaz and Bahia have yielded rich harvests of organic remains comparableto those mentioned on preceding pages. Of these, the extensive series of cavesand deep fissures between the Rio das Velhas and the Rio Paraopeba in MinasGeraes state have yielded evidence of much importance. Staggering quantities ofbones filled these apertures, but usually in such broken condition and sopromiscuously that complete skeletons were extreme rarities. Near Caxoeira doCampo, for instance, is a cave some 120ft (36.9m) long, 6-9ft (1.8-2.7m) wideand 30-40ft (9-12m) high. From this the excavator Lund procured half a cubicfoot of red earth packed with minute bones. Of all the half under-jawsdetectable in it, 400 belonged to small opossums and the remainder to no lessthan 2,000 different kinds of mice, bats, porcupines and small birds. It shouldbe stressed that Lund counted only under-jaws; numberless other small bones inthe sample remained uncounted. Elsewhere, Lund excavated the whole of the clayfloor of a 24ft (7.3m) long cavern at the Fazenda do Escravimia. The clay filled6,552 firkins 285 . Lund again counted all the half under-jaws ina measured sample of this clay and, on the assumption that similar jaws werespread fairly uniformly throughout the remainder of it, concluded that theremains of not less than 6,881,500 individuals of opossums, mice, cavias andporcupines lay entombed within it. Even if this calculated total was exaggeratedby as much as six times reality, a prodigious total of approximately 1,000,000still results! In addition to these were immense numbers of uncounted bones ofsmall birds, lizards, frogs and other diminutive creatures.Among the more interesting larger animals found by Lund were the Megatherium,Mylodon, Toxodon, Macrauchenia, the giant armadillo Hopolophorus, an enormousrodent related to the modern Capybara, the extinct jaguar Smilodon neogaeus,Chlamydotherium, the defunct monkey Protopithecus, a mastodon and the flightlessemu and rhea. It should be noted that mastodon remains seldom occur in caverns,being more usually discovered in fissures or natural hollows or pits underlyingsuperficial deposits.Several caves explored by Lund around the margin of Lagoa do Sumidouro, nearSanta Lucia, contained human bones mingled with those of the extinct cavejaguar, a huge Capybara, and others belonging to horses and llamas 28 \". Onecave was especially noteworthy for yielding the bones of over fifty human beingsof both sexes and every age from infant to decrepit old man. Their skeletons layburied in hard clay and were discovered mixed together in such confusion - notonly with each other but with Megatherium bones and those of other late'Pleistocene' animals - as to preclude the idea that they had been buried byhuman agency. All the remains, both animal and human, possessed the samechemical composition, thereby indicating the contemporaneity of all theindividuals represented 287 . Interestingly, the skulls of these ancient humanswere dolichocephalic (or long-headed), a character which, according to ProfScott-Elliott 288 and many other anthropologists, was distinctive of the 'old'European Neanderthal race, formerly thought to have been ancestral to modernhumans {Homo Sapiens) and to have become extinct about 25,000 years ago.picture27 [images/picture27.jpg]Fig 2.4.

Some prominent 'late Pleistocene' animals of North AmericaIllustrations from \"The Fossil Book\" by Carroll Imiic Fenton and Mildred AdamsFenton, reprinted by permission of Doubleday & Co, Inc.Both these premises have proved to be fallacious. The lineage of Neanderthal Manis now known to have differed from that of Homo Sapiens - not being ancestral tomodern humans 289 , and that this race is now known to have survived in at leastthe Levant until Middle Palaeolithic times, or approximately 10,000 year ago 29\". The Neanderthals lived in organised communities, which would account for somany differently-aged individuals in the Lagoa Santa cave remains, although theyalso are suspected of being cannibalistic 291Although comparatively rare, human remains have also been found in certain NorthAmerican caves. Conkling or Bishop's Cap Cave in the Organ Mountains, NewMexico, for instance, contained scattered human bones chaotically deposited withthose of a ground-sloth (Nothrotherium), a coyote, a very large wolf (Aenocyon),numerous rodents, a horse, bison, an antelope, a camel (Tanupolama) and other'Pleistocene' animals 292 . Several of these animals have turned up again invarious other caves in the United States. In Gypsum Cave, near Las Vegas,Nevada, for example, unusually well-preserved fresh-looking remains ofNothro-therium, the camel, horse, and the mountain-sheep, have been discovered293 , while bone-breccias at Bootlegger Sink, Pennsylvania, have yielded a richharvest of late 'Pleistocene' animals in every way analogous to those fromequivalent European breccias 294 .But by far the most intriguing North American cave evidence was that found in aclosed cave near Cumberland, Maryland. Among the animals discovered were thetapir, crocodile, wolverine, lemming, mink, porcupine, hare, red-squirrel,long-tailed shrew, badger, elk, coyote and a puma-like feline. Though mostlybroken or fractured, all the remains were notably fresh-looking 295 . Dr J WGidley and Dr C L Gazin, who conduct-ed the first scientific investigation of these remains, observed:Many of the species are comparable to forms how living in the vicinity of thecave; but others are distinctly northern or Boreal in their affinities, and someare related to species peculiar to the southern, or Lower Austral, region. 296Initially these faunal differences were interpreted as meaning that the northernanimals were deposited during a cool glacial episode and the southern formsduring a warmer interglacial episode. This explanation subsequently crumbled,however, when continuing researches showed all the animals to have been coeval.Indeed, it was reluctantly admitted that: \"This strange assemblage of fossilremains occurs hopelessly intermingled... 297 .Confronted by all the foregoing evidence, its internal consistency and globaldistribution, it is difficult to withhold agreement from the following remarksby a former president of the Edinburgh Geological Society, which, though appliedat the time to European bone-caves, relate equally to the equivalent sites onother continents:...It is certain that these caves and fissures, so packed with carcasses, arenow almost universally dissociated and broken off from the old lines of drainagein which they discharged the function of river channels... the old surfaces ofcountry in which they occupied this position have been totally destroyed; andthis destruction can only have been due to great fractures and great bendings ofthe underlying rocks... in very recent times great changes in the moulding ofthe earth's surface over a great part of Europe occurred with sufficientrapidity to cause a great destruction of animal life... 298 . [Our italics].11 Illusory Faunass-'^iSit&iziZizr*Before leaving the remarkable evidence of the bone-caves, some further aspectsof the extraordinary story they tell require highlighting.The tremendous, if disorderly, concentrations in certain caves and fissures ofthe bones of just one animal type, or very few types, is replicated on nearlyall continents. Such distribution indicates that the cause of this phenomenoncannot, as is often postulated, have resulted, however indirectly, from even themost widespread ice action that it is possible to image - action which, as wehave seen, in any case almost certainly never occurred.During the formative decades of geological science, when certain cavesconfronted pioneer investigators with an unnatural abundance of remains ofparticular animal types, special names reflecting their speleological occurrencewere invented to distinguish them. Among these were Ursus- spelaeus (cave bear),Hyaena (Crocuta) spelaea (cave hyaena) and Panthera (Leo/Felis) spelaea (cavelion). Although the actual remains showed no special adaptation to regularcave-dwelling habits, it was assumed that the animals concerned had beencave-dwellers because they were found where they were.Significantly, most of the animals awarded 'speleological' names were carnivoresapparently related to living species which do sometimes favour caves as dens orlairs. It was not long before scholars were postulating certain caves as formerbear or hyaena dens.The first such explanation appears to have been proposed as early as 1795 byRosenmuller*' regarding the preponderance of bear remains met with in certainGerman caves 300 , but did not achieve general popular-ity until 1821 when Buckland championed it to account for the unusually largenumber of hyaena bones found at Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire 301 , and otherswrote about such lairs in verse 302 . Buckland's theory was also especiallynotable for involving climatic changes - for were not hyaenas, which no longerinhabit Britain, tropical animals? For a while, Buckland's notion of a 'hyaenaden' became 'front page news' 303 .Quick to appreciate that point - duplicated by much other botanical and faunalevidence from temperate, even Arctic, latitudes across vast tracts of thenorthern hemisphere -Buckland's contemporaries, as well as many later writers304 , concluded that much warmer conditions than now had formerly prevailed atKirkdale when hyaenas had frequented it and other now cool-temperate localitiesyielding such remains. Indeed, Buckland himself remarked that the presence oftropical hyaenas at Kirkdale indicated \"...a probable change of climate in thenorthern hemisphere\" 305 .It is hardly necessary to remind ourselves that all these conclusions andspeculations appeared a full seven years before the publication of Lyell's'uniformitarian' principles, and almost seventeen years before the announcementof Agassiz's glacial (ice age) hypothesis - both of which we discussed in PartOne.But the early palaeontologists operated a kind of 'double standard', for, whereabundant herbivore remains predominated in cave breccias, as for example atMaccacogne in Sicily or Lagoa Santa in Brazil, they coined no 'speleological'names for them because their living, or nearest living, counterparts werenatural denizens of grassland, woodland or aquatic environments, and acave-dwelling existence could not be envisaged forsuch animals in any numbers, particularly as their skeletal remains showedabsolutely no adaptations to the regular habitation of caves.When, also, it is remembered that the bones of innumerable carnivores andherbivores identical to those entombed in the cave and fissure deposits havebeen found in coeval ('Pleistocene') gravels, sands and other strata elsewhere,often scores, even hundreds of miles distant from caves, it is apparent thatthey enjoyed a non-cave-dwelling existence. In this context, 'speleological'species names are incongruous. Nor is it convincing that the prodigious numbersof herbivore remains encountered in some caves can all have been the remnants ofindividuals dragged inside them by cave-dwelling bears, hyaenas, wolves or lions-even if extended over a period of many years. The curiously complete skeletonsat Choukoutien, the sheer size of mastodon, mammoth and rhinoceros skeletonsfound in other caves, and the extraordinary number of hippopotamus individualsin the Sicilian caves around Palermo, are all details militating againstinterpretations requiring the herbivores to have been the remains of carcassesdragged into caves by carnivores.The latter's failure to even commence dismembering some of the still-completeherbivore cadavers, supposedly dragged with immense effort inside the caves fromwithout, or cornered and killed within it, is also inconsistent behaviour amongcarnivores habitually occupying caves, since they could hardly have failed todispose of the carcasses over the immediately ensuing period.The fact that certain caves contain virtually uncountable numbers of bones or,equally abnormally, are choked with the remains of a single animal type,deserves some explanation as to precisely what set of circumstances could haveproduced such effects.If steadily worsening conditions preceding the outbreak of whatever slaughteredthese animals signalled impending great danger even to the animals themselves,their actions will almost certainly have conformed to the behaviour patternspeculiar to different animal groups. Herbivores will have reacted with typicalmass herd reactions; carnivores,canines excepted, as individuals or as limited family groups; and canines,especially wolves and other wild dogs, probably as packs. All creatures,irrespective of the categories to which they naturally belonged, would haveinstinctively sought shelter, and in many cases caves clearly offered idealsanctuaries.Unless the herbivores were large or very numerous, the carnivores wouldinevitably oust herbivores from caves to usurp their refugia. Herbivores seekingsanctuary would naturally avoid caves already occupied by carnivores and seekalternative shelter. It is not difficult therefore to appreciate how some cavescame to be occupied solely by either carnivores or herbivores, and sometimes byjust one species of animal.But examples have been cited where both carnivores and herbivores co-mingled ina single cave, perhaps the only refuge available for miles - the panic-strickenrecipients of a common threat among whom natural hostilities were mutuallysuspended.The evidence everywhere strongly suggests that all these cave occupants weredrowned en masse by violent water action, and in many cases never lived wherethey were entombed. It is also patently obvious, and will become ever more so asthis saga unfolds, that those animals caught outside sanctuaries were alsooverwhelmed and then swept into and buried within caves and fissures alongsidethe original occupants, by the same massively destructive agent. This explainsthe mixture of faunal elements in many caves and fissures, the reason why youngand old were slaughtered indiscriminately, and why the bone-cave phenomenon isgenerally of such worldwide extent. The underlying cause operated as thoroughlyin supposedly glaciated areas as it did in those postulated to have laid outsidethem - and generally similarly in all hemispheres.Enormous numbers of these animals, though now found in Arctic Siberia, Alaskaand other lands now unable to support them, were moved vast distances from theiroriginal homelands by swiftly-moving water which transported them tumultuouslyin as immense moving masses of twisting, churning, water-borne organic debris,mud, siltand boulders. Only such a scenario explains the aforementioned evidence fromAlaska, and the astoundingly fissured and shattered bones in the caves ofAustralasia and elsewhere - invariably buried in the utmost confusion, rammedinto the furthest crevices of caves or buried astonishing depths downdeeply-tortuous rock fissures.Collectively, all the foregoing indicates that the pioneer students of theseextraordinary remains committed an unfortunate error in inventing cave faunasthat never actually existed, even though, as today, certain carnivores dosometimes inhabit caves for indefinite periods. Few, of course, will doubt thatoccasional lucky carnivore survivors of this traumatic episode (and a handful ofthese did exist) will, following the general cessation of this suggestedstupendous water action, have located carcass-filled caves and fissures, andsubsequently used them as ready-made larders. Carnivore tooth-marks on herbivorebones in cave breccias, as at Kirkdale andother caverns, strongly suggest that such occasions did indeed arise here andthere in post-diluvial times, with some sites accordingly becoming bear andhyaena dens for unknown periods of time. But overall assessment of the knownevidence indicates that such places were not common, even though, as seen later,other more terrible interpretations of the same evidence are possible.Removal of the Ice Age of orthodoxy, as previously advocated, together with therealisation that most of the animals found in the cave and fissure deposits werenever natural denizens of such sites, immediately eliminates the necessity toenvisage cave faunas of the kind postulated by conventional treatment of thesubject. The absence of such an Ice Age also invalidates those concepts whichcall for alternating glacial and interglacial interludes and the differinganimal assemblages associated with them. In short, such faunas, especially thecave faunas, are illusory.12Abnormal Burials«^s3fe**±£«r»The mammoths and mastodons mentioned throughout this book belonged to that groupof trunk-bearing mammals known as Proboscidea. Unlike the mammoths, mastodonswere not true elephants but a separate and generally more primitive proboscideanbranch which parallelled them. Very numerous during late Pliocene and'Pleistocene' times, the dominant form at the time of the great disaster we arealluding to was Mammut (formerly Mastodon).Originally common in Europe and southern Asia during late Pliocene and early'Pleistocene' times, Mammut seems to have largely withdrawn from those regionsby the close of the 'Pleistocene' period, when, how-ever, it abounded throughout the Americas. Mammut americanum, sometimes referredto as Mastodon giganteus, was the commonest North American species, whereas inSouth America M andium and M humboldti predominated. The main differencesbetween these species was in their dentition.Mature individuals of M americanum stood about 9V2ft (3m) tall at the shoulders,although occasionally higher stature was attained. The feet had five toes, thegreat weight of these animals being carried by a large springy pad on theunderside of the foot, a feature present even in juveniles. In life, the bodywas covered with rusty or dun coloured hair, and the tusks, which were large,tended to curve gentlypicture30 [images/picture30.jpg]Fig 2.6. Mammut Americanum: the life appearance of the American mastodon, basedon buried specimens found in theUnited States. Illustration from \"The Fossil Book\" by Carroll Lane Fenton andMildred Adams Fenton, copyright 1958.Reprinted with permission of Doubleday & Co, Inc.upwards. These details are well known because several more or less completecarcasses of these great creatures have been discovered in salt marshes andbogs.The youthful appearance of many American mastodon remains is most striking, andhas induced the observation that: \"Some mastodon skeletons show every evidencethat the animals lasted down to very late periods well within 'historic times',as that phrase is construed in Europe...\" 306 .There is now no doubt that many mastodons survived in the New World well intoHolocene times, when they were seen and hunted by palaeo-Indians. They survivedan event that indiscriminately destroyed enormous herds of them, whichdismembered and buried countless individuals of all ages and both sexes in greatalkaline mud-banks and similar deposits, and which at many localities preservedtheir battered carcasses nearly as effectively as ice and frost did the Alaskanand Siberian mammoths.While the northern animals were frozen solid in ground almost instantly reducedtopermafrost conditions, the mastodons were entombed in great avalanches of mudand salts that, upon consolidating, often preserved many of their soft parts andsometimes even their stomach contents. Interestingly, while the Siberian andAlaskan mammoth remains often lie near or at the bottom of the 'muck' formation,so these mastodon carcasses frequently occur at or near the base of the NorthAmerican bogs and marshes, which themselves often occupy hollows in the 'drift'3117 . The two sets of deposits thus appear to be essentially complimentary, andtheir origin probably a more or less simultaneous result of a common paroxysmalevent, as mastodon and mammoth remains have been found at some localities lyingalongside each other. Thus:In America the mastodon deposits are diluvial, and agree in position with thosecontaining Elephas primigenius (in Eurasia) 308 .Among the first recorded discoveries of mastodons with preserved soft parts werefive individuals found some 3 miles (4.8km) from the Ohio River by the ShawanyIndians in 1762. Dr Warren, a diligent recorder of many early finds, mentionsthat: \"...In digging a well near the entrance of the Wabash into the Ohio, therewere found some bones of a mastodon... in company with skin and hair\" 309 .Accompanying another skeleton found elsewhere were large pieces of skinresembling \"fresh-rtanned leather\" 110 . The freshness of these mastodon softparts is not unique, nor indeed peculiar to mastodons, but applies equally tothe vegetable remains often found with them. Thus, occurring with a mastodonskeleton discovered in Orange County, New York state, in 1845, was a:...mass of broken twigs, etc, lying beneath the pelvic bones... in quantityabout five or six bushels; towards the posterior portion, it presented threetraces of convolutions, passing in a straight column of four inches diameterthrough the pelvic orifice, and behind the ischium terminating in a homogeneousmass, evidently of a foecal character. 311A year earlier, several mastodon skeletons came to light in a natural basin atHackett's Town, New Jersey, affording evidence of stomach contents 312 , and afurther instance occurred somewhat later at Newburgh on the Hudson River, when amass of crushed twigs was observed between the ribs of a mastodon found there313 . Yet another discovery of the same ilk occurred near Jamestown, New Yorkstate, in August 1871. The find was examined in situ by, among others, Prof S GLove, whose report, cited in Hartnagel and Bishop's valuable survey of New Yorkmastodon discoveries 314 , is well worth reading.Microscopical examination of samples of these stomach contents revealed that theNewburgh mastodon apparently fed on hemlock-spruce 315 and that the Hackett'sTown mastodons had evidently eaten young shoots of the white cedar 316 . It mustbe relevant, therefore, that white cedar wood is prominent in the previouslynoted subterraneanforests of mid-western North America, which perished suddenly and were burieddeep under 'drift' deposits.The calamitously abrupt character of this event is underscored by the unexpectedpositions in which several virtually complete mastodon skeletons have beendiscovered. For example, nearly all the skeletons found in the deposits in thevalley of the Great Osage river were in a nearly vertical position 317 ; andJames Southall says that, since early colonial days, many others have been metwith standing erect just below the surface of swamps or bogs 318 . Again in theNewburgh mastodon: \"The anterior extremities were extended under and in front ofthe head... The posterior extremities were extended forward under the body\" 319.And of another discovered in Monmouth County, New Jersey, in 1823, we read that:...its vertebral column, with all its joints and ribs attached to them in theirnatural position, lay about eight or ten inches below the surface. The scapularested upon the heads of the humeri, and these in a vertical position upon thebones of the forearm, as in life. The fore-arm was still buried. It inclined alittle backwards, and the foot which was immediately below it was placed inadvance of the other, as it would be if the animal had been walking. The fourfeet rested on the sandy stratum underlying the black earth in which the animalwas embedded. 320 [Our italics].Likewise, Van Rensselaer, discussing a mastodon skeleton found in 1823 near LongBranch, New Jersey, reported that: \"Its position... was vertical, the feetresting on a stratum of sand and gravel, and the head to the west-south-west 321.Elsewhere, mastodons have been discovered in other strange positions. Warrensays the remains of the Hackett's Town specimens were:...found covered from four to six feet deep, except the largest, which lay nearthe south-east side of the basin, and were but slightly covered. A few feet tothe north ofthis lay the next in size on its back, and a little to the north and west ofthis the other two, both as if in a standing position; and the calf was found ina similar position near the north side of the basin... The question verynaturally occurs, 'How and when did so many of these large animals becomeembedded in this narrow space?' - questions more easily asked than answered. Myfirst conjecture, before seeing the place, was, that they had been mired inattempting to reach a spring or lick; but the small extent and shallowness ofthe basin, and the gradual descent and character of its bottom (which... isperfectly solid... closely paved with rolled stones...) all forbid such asupposition. 322 [Our italics].Even if these animals were mired - which, contrary to evidence, is still themost popular explanation - it is exceedingly difficult to conceive how, oncestuck fast in thick mud, even a powerful animal like a mastodon could manage toturn itself upside-down and become buried 'on its back'. Certainly it might fallto one side and remain there for evermore, but not upside-down. The solid natureof the underlying strata is also interesting and repeated at many sites. Thatthese animals may have sensed the catastrophe about to engulf them is possiblyindicated by the curiously repeated south-west to northeast alignment of many oftheir remains 323 . Were they turning to face or to avoid a threat so enormousand sudden that in many instances there was not even time for them to be knockedover by it? Certainly we agree with Warren's observation that:The cause of the disappearance of the mastodon seems to be mysterious. We are...disposed to believe that an animal of so large a size, of so great a strengthand such extensive distribution... must have required some great and generalcatastrophe to overwhelm and annihilate it. 324That water was a major element in that catastrophe has been traced at otherNorth American mastodon sites. Thus, around asalt-marsh at Saltville in Virginia containing the remains of mastodon,Mammuthus primigenius and numerous other coeval animals and freshwater clams,many large angular blocks of jasperoid lying on the lower slopes of the hillsrimming the marsh are \"distinctly water-worn\". Significantly, many of the clamsstill retain their iridescent nacreous shell layer as well as the perios-tracum325 , so geologically recent was their demise.As well as mastodons, other contemporary animals retaining portions of theirsoft parts have been found in these North American bogs and marshes. Articularcartilage and tendinous attachments occurred on bones of a giant feline(Megalonyx) described by Dr Leidy in 1859 326 , and soft parts adhered to theremains of a peccary found in a saltpetre deposit in Kentucky. But it is in thefrozen ground of Siberia and Alaska that the most famous discoveries of thiskind have been made.The millions of animals that perished during the terrible convulsions whichterminated the so-called 'Pleistocene' times were nowhere more dramaticallypreserved than in Siberia 375 . There, the picture is everywhere one ofappalling disorder, carnage and wholesale destruction, with countless animalsand plants frozen in positions of death ever since the day they perished. As aresult, their remains are amazingly fresh-looking and are frequentlyindistinguishable from those of animals and plants that have died mere weeksago. Here and there amid the chaotic masses of organic debris occur whole orpartial carcasses of a wide array of late 'Pleistocene' animals - the Arcticequivalents of the mastodon cadavers just mentioned, and just as informative.These Siberian examples, however, have been deposited in particularly noteworthyfashion.In the Lyakhov Islands, for instance, there exists an extensive lower layer ofgranular ice, 70ft (21m) thick, not formed from compacted snow, and directlyoverlying this is a layer of clayey freshwater material enclosing numberlesstusks and skins of mammoths together with the refrigerated corpses of musk-ox,horse, rhinoceros,American stag, antelope, reindeer, tiger and other mammoths 127 . One of themammoth carcasses found here was of special interest in that its remains hadbeen smashed before coming to rest, for pieces of it were distributed around themain body of the specimen and much of its hair had been removed and its skinbadly cut and excoriated 328 . Its mode of burial had obviously been exceedinglyviolent.This singular depositional sequence is evidently extraordinarily widespread, forit is encountered many hundreds of miles distant in the valley of the Berezovkariver. There, a mammoth carcass excavated in the middle Kolyma region in 1901,at a place by riverside cliffs, lay in a depression in fossil ice into which ithad apparently been partially thrust. Great quantities of blood had flowed fromthe acute wounds it had suffered at the time of death, and this had congealedand frozen solid along with the dismembered tail of a bovine animal which wasfound immediately below the mammoth's right forefoot 324 . Not very far distantin the same district, the perfectly preserved upper part of a horse's skull,complete with muscle fibres, was found buried between the trunks of larch treesprotruding from the river banks 330 , while further east, in the valley of theIndigirka River, similar mangled animal remains have come to light.Still further east, in the Yana valley, an allegedly complete carcass of a horseor pony was found during the late 1890's in frozen soil on the banks of a tundralake north of Verkhoyansk. The specimen, which was never collected, is said tohave possessed long greyish-white hair 331 .Very interestingly, Sir Roderick Murchison, reporting on the results of athen-recent expedition down the Yenisei River, recorded that:During the progress of this expedition the important discovery has been made ofentire skeletons of mammoths, whose skin and hair has been preserved in frozenmud... the heads of these extinct elephants were, for the most part turnedtowards the south, as if the animals had been retreatingsouthwards when caught either by inundation proceeding from the North Polarregion... for when we travel southwards, we find mammoth remains becoming muchscarcer, and instead of whole animals, we meet with their broken and disjointedbones only, as if they had been transported from the north. 332This closely parallels the previously-noted observations about the dispositionof the upright mastodon carcasses and skeletons.That water moving on a gigantic scale was indeed involved with these widespreadextinctions is suggested by the head of a woolly rhinoceros, Coelodontatichorhinus, discovered in 1771 near the Vilyui (Wiliui) River north of Yakutsk.Prof A F Brandt of Berlin wrote:On a careful examination of the head... it was... remarkable that theblood-vessels and even the fine capillaries were... filled with brown coagulatedblood which in many places still preserved its red colour 333 .Asphyxia, either by drowning or suffocation, invariably induces gorging of thecapillaries with blood. Brandt's analysis of the matrix adhering to thisparticular rhinoceros established drowning as the cause of death, and showedthat it was buried with fragments of freshwater Pleistocene plants 334 . It mustbe relevant that buried masses of ancient ice occur, encasing the carcasses ofmammoths and their contemporaries as at Berezovka, elsewhere along the Vilyuivalley.During the late 1700s, Pallas visited large areas of Siberia. In the IrtishRiver valley, he found sub-fossilised shells of living species no longerthriving at such latitudes. Many still preserved their horny pelicles and someretained traces of the molluscs themselves. Bones of mammoths and other extinctanimals occurred in the same formation, and nearby the heads of great fishes andpieces of cellular bone of unidentifiable origin 335 . Elsewhere he saw apetrified jaw-bone coated with mus-picture31 [images/picture31.jpg]Fig 2.7. Frozen Mammoth of the Berezovka. Photo by / Kirchner. By permission ofthe American Museum of Natural History.sels 33 \". He regarded these as having \"...come from a great inundation\" 1 ' 7 .If yet further evidence is needed, we can mention the discovery of a whaleskeleton far inland on the Chukchee peninsula in north-eastern Siberia, stillpartially covered by skin, with deep red, almost fresh flesh adhering to many ofits bones 338 . River floods had partly eroded the frozen sand enveloping thisindividual the preceding winter, and ,as exposure of the carcass to even onesummer's sun would have induced putrefaction long ago, there could be no doubtof the specimen's very great antiquity. It was found at the same level as thebones of mammoths and other 'Pleistocene' mammals.An almost identical picture emerges in neighbouring Alaska, where, in the 'muck'beds:The excellent state of preservation of many of the bones, the recent decay ofanimal matter shown by the existing odour, quantities of hair found in contactwith a mammoth's skull, the occurrence of the outer sheath of bison's horns, andthe finding of vertebrae of bovine animals lying in their proper order ofsequence, render it probable that entire carcasses were deposited, and thatcongelation followed close upon their entombment. 339 (Our italics).Furthermore:Most of the bodies of the animals had been torn and twisted by some violentcataclysm before being frozen in the enveloping muck... The archaeologists alsofound mammoth's meat which was still in an edible state. 340Richardson and Hibben, who made these observations, wrote before the more recentdiscovery of a partial carcass of a frozen baby mammoth in the Alaskan 'muck'beds 341 , a find fully justifying Richardson's speculations over a century ago.This discovery is not unique, however, for in the summer of 1977 therefrigerated carcass of another baby mammoth, believed to be geologically olderthan its American counterpart, was exhumed near Madagan in eastern Siberia 342 .Among other Alaskan evidence may be mentioned the frozen carcass of a youngmusk-ox 343 , and the partially complete frozen cadavers of bison, severalfelines, various deer and a wide range of other contemporaries of the mammothfound at localities scattered across the state's western terrain 344Similar burials occur even in Europe. A complete rhinoceros carcass preserved inan oil-saturated deposit has been found in Poland, and several mammoth skeletonsor partial carcasses have been found in European Russia standing upright inconsolidated silty mud. Of the latter, the best known examples were discoveredat Swijatosski near St Petersburg in 1775 345 , another near the same city about1826 m , and one at Troitzkoe near Moscow in 1846, associated with plantfragments, fish scales and bones and pieces of coal 347 . All were reminiscentof the finds of erect mastodons in North America.Unquestionably the Siberian and Alaskan animals and plants were the commonvictims of a catastrophe which afflicted both countries with equal force andproduced similar results - results remarkably similar to those already noted atmany Asiatic, European, North American and Australasian bone-caves and fissures,where entire or partially whole animals were also tumultuously entombed in theflesh. This aspect of the fossil evidence, whether encountered at allegedlyglaciated localities or not, is impressively consistent worldwide.On the basis of present mollusc distribution, the testimony of the now-vanishednorthern forests, the evidence of the lost Miocene Ocean and the centralSiberian pollen record, northern latitudes were much warmer than today 348 .Quite clearly, therefore, the mammoth and its companions did not live during anIce Age. They were the victims of an event which produced one, and which, inSiberia and Alaska, either transported their remains into arctic latitudes, orinvested those latitudes with glacial conditions.picture32 [images/picture32.jpg]Fig 2.8.

Courtesy of the Univ ofSouthampton.13 Incompatible Bedfellowsf^oM-aiJ^nIf upright skeletons and amazingly preserved frozen animals are prominent facetsof the 'Pleistocene' biological record, so too is the following remarkableevidence from California, South America and Africa.The previously-mentioned asphalt and tar-seeps in California, which contain sucha varied assortment of birds, are also the cemeteries for a rich assemblage oflate 'Pleistocene' faunal and floral life. The most spectacular discoveries haveoccurred at Rancho La Brea. There, the remains are packed tightly together intoan almost unbelievable conglomeration: \"...a bed of bones... in which the numberof sabre-tooth and wolf skulls together averaged twenty per cubic yard\" 349 .So abundant were the remains that between 1906, when systematic excavationsfirst began, and 1931, no fewer than 700 skulls had been retrieved of thesabre-toothed tiger (Smilodon) alone 350 . Accompanying these was a quitestaggering profusion of bones and teeth belonging to horses, camels, bison,mastodons, mammoths, rodents, coyotes, wolves, sloths and numerous other mammalsand birds 351 . Initially accorded a late Pliocene antiquity, later studiesshowed these remains to be coeval with late 'Pleistocene' plants collected fromthe Carpinteria asphalts. Very significantly, these plants proved to be typicalof a Recent flora now only thriving 200 miles (320km) further north 352 .The exceptional number of animals at Rancho La Brea is usually explained thus:some animal stuck fast in the tar, crying out, attracted mammalian and aviancarnivores anxious to secure an easy meal, but these in turn, also becomingensnared in the sticky trap, joined their hoped for meals, the grim cycle beingrepeated innumerable times.This interpretation, however, is badly at odds with the facts, for, as ProfMerriam has observed:As the greater number of the animals... have been entrapped in the tar, it is tobe presumed that in a large percentage of cases the major portion of theskeleton has been preserved. Contrary to expectations, connected skeletons arenot common. 353 (Our italics).Admittedly the bones are splendidly preserved as far as their often fragmentarystate allows 354 , but are, like their counterparts in the Alaskan 'muck' beds:\"...broken, mashed, contorted, and mixed in a most heterogeneous mass, such ascould never have resulted from the chance trapping and burial of a fewstragglers\" 355 .These animals were apparently buried violently in an already dismemberedcondition. Interestingly, a human skull, found among these animals, was assignedto 'Ice Age' times as the associated animal remains were of supposedly similarantiquity. The skull, however, is typical of normal crania in livingAmerindians, a point of particular significance when we come to consider ournext Californian discovery.Shortly after the mid-nineteenth century discovery of gold in California, asuccession of noteworthy finds occurred at several places where auriferousgravels, underlying lava-capped mountain ridges, were mined or tunnelled intofor the precious metal. Of these finds Dr G F Wright has left us the followinginteresting account:As early as 1863 Dr Snell of Sonora began a systematic collection of animal andhumanpicture34 [images/picture34.jpg]remains from the mines in his vicinity. In his collection were several objectsmarked as 'from under Table Mountain', among which was a human jaw...In 1857 Hon Paul Hubbs, of Vallejo... picked a portion of a human skull out ofthe dirt as it was brought from the Valentine Shaft, under Table Mountain, nearShaw's Flat...Ten years after, Mr Hubbs more fully detailed the circumstances of thediscovery, and Professor Whitney and Gorham Blake Esq, made special examinationof the locality and careful enquiries of the owners of the mine, and satisfiedthemselves that the bone really came from under the basaltic covering of TableMountain... All this is preliminary to the famous Calaveras skull...\" 6The Calaveras skull was found by a certain Mr Mattison during February 1866 nextto a petrified conifer 60-80ft (18-25m) long within gravel in a mine tunnelunderlying 40ft (12m) of basalt capping Table Mountain near Altaville. It wasoriginally mistaken for a petrified tree-stump as it was so encrusted with earthand stony matter\" 7 . However:...the appearance of the skull in every way corroborated his (Mattison's)statement. The original incrustation shows that it was not taken from a cave...Fragments of bones and gravel and shells, were so wedged into the cavities ofthe skull... that there could be no mistake as to the character of the situationin which it was found. Chemical analysis showed that organic matter was nearlyabsent, and... (that the skull) was in a fossilised condition 358 .Wright also observed:...the Calaveras skull, which, if genuine, far antedates anything human whichhas been discovered in Europe, is not of a particularly inferior order... 359 .Earlier scholars dated the skull as Pliocene because among other finds madeunder Table Mountain were the remnants of the typicalpicture35 [images/picture35.jpg]Fig 2.11. The Calaveras skull (after Whitney).Pliocene horse Hipparion iW , not recognised as having survived into latePleistocene times until much later 361 . Today, the Table Mountain gravels areusually regarded as Pleistocene, while in some quarters the Calaveras skull has,despite much evidence to the contrary, been interpreted as that of a modernrather than a fossil man 362 . Other human remains, reportedly found in anothermine tunnelled under Table Mountain 363 , were certainly fossil, beingassociated with late 'Pleistocene' plants and the bones of mastodons and itscontemporaries believedly deposited by \"tumultuous waters\" 364 .Great natural convulsions must also have been responsible for the disposition ofwhales and other marine creatures on the crests of mountains in various otherparts of California. Thus Hay quotes Dr Steven Bowers as stating:Bones of whales and other cetaceans are met with in various portions of thecounty [Ventura county], especially along the sides and crests of the SantaPaula mountains.On the summit of this range, at an altitude of 2,000ft, the remains of a largeseal, probably Eumetopias stelleri (E jubata), were obtained...\" \\Bowers assigned a Pliocene age to the deposits containing these remains, but Hayand others have shown that they date from later 'Pleistocene' times - in whichcase the deposition of cetaceans at such altitudes during times so geologicallyrecent can only have proceeded under conditions that, elsewhere, would be termedcatastrophic.Animal fossils from the San Pedro Valley, California, present apparentlyanomalous fau-nal mixtures of much interest. Included are Miocene sharks, sealsand porpoises, allegedly early Pleistocene sea-lions and land vertebrates,species of molluscs, sea-urchins, bryozoans and foraminifera which are stillflourishing but unknown as fossils before Pleistocene times, and numerous latePleistocene mammals and birds 366 . These are classic examples of 'old' and'new' organisms coexisting in incompatible habitats or being assembledtumultuously and consigned to a common grave.Last century, Prof P M Duncan, studying the Lake Titicaca basin of Andean Peru/Bolivia, noted the existence of siluroid, cypri-noid and other marine fishes inthe lake, and that corals attached to rocks underlying the extensive nitratedeposits along the presently waterless Peruvian coast west of the lake representexisting species 367 . Today these corals lie 2,500-3,000ft (769-923m) above sealevel. This region, however, which must once have lain much lower, is believedto have been well-wooded in the recent past and to have supported a rich andvaried fauna. Numerous skeletons of forest-dwelling ant-eaters strewn acrosswhat is now the desert of Tarapaca eloquently testify to this 368 .Some unexpected 'late' occurrences of geologically 'old' animals have beenreported from equatorial Africa. For example, in 1931, a portion of anarticulated skeleton of the Miocene elephant Deinotherium was found in'Pleistocene' deposits at Olduvai (Oldoway), Kenya, associated with shells ofspecies still thriving in those latitudes. The skeletonoccurred: \"...in conditions which preclude the possibility that it isderivative\" 36 ''.Other Deinotherium bones and teeth had previously been observed near Ngeti closeto the Ugandan border with the then Congo territories (Zaire) by the Belgiangeologist Delpierre, in beds which: \"...on other evidence, he was convinced areof Pleistocene date. He affirmed, too, that these most unexpected fossils werenot derived\" 370 .More recently, further Deinotherium remains were retrieved from supposedly'early Pleistocene' beds near Teleki volcano, Kenya, along with bones of aMachairodont lion, a large mustelid, Hyaena cf namaquensis, a hare, Tatera,Hystrix, a mastodon, a primitive elephant, several pigs, an extinct rhinoceros,a horse (Stylohipparion), a hippopotamus, a large giraffe, an okapi, variousbovines, two kinds of crocodile, three species of tortoise (one of great size)and numerous fishes 371 .Recent reports and photographic records from an enclosed valley in the NepaleseHimalayas of a herd of living elephants apparently allied on the one hand to theStegodon, a Pliocene and early 'Pleistocene' Asiatic ancestor of the modernelephants 372 , and on the other, to Stegomaston, a mastodont genus as yetcertainly known only from the early Pleistocene of the Americas 373 , suggest aneven more interesting instance of late survival of an animal extinct elsewhere,and that 'out-of-place' fossils like the Is-Shantiin cave Miocene shark teethand the Deinotherium remains just noted are indeed highly germane to the subjectof this book.Although little is presently known about them or their significance to generalproboscidean evolution 374 , these elephants almost certainly represent relictanimals isolated in their present remote domain through the huge topographicalchanges wrought in the Himalayan region about 11,000 years ago by the greatcatastrophe here being unveiled - as we have seen in Part One."},{"pageContent":"Naturalists offer different explanations for these finds of antiquated specieslying alongside those of geologically more modern aspect, frequentlyinterpreting them as much on supposed geophysical grounds as on their anomalousbiological character. Such assemblages,picture36 [images/picture36.jpg]Fig 2.12. Deinotherium, which reached a height of 10ft (3m) at the shoulders.

Original drawing by / B Delair.both plant and animal, recur in nearly all latitudes, and were apparentlyproduced more or less synchronously everywhere. Thus attributing the evidencefrom higher, colder latitudes to 'glacial' conditions is as questionable asascribing evidence from lower, warmer latitudes to non-'glacial' causes.Non-'glacial' causes are advocated solely because of the assumed existence ofextensive and chimerical northern ice-sheets. Neither non-existent northern'glacial' conditions nor southern non-'glacial' causes are valid scenarios, andsome alternative agency responsible for creating the recorded effects must bebrought to light.The evidence itself is perfectly unambiguous. Along with the removal of an 'IceAge' like that which has been hitherto commonly envisaged, the evidence stronglysuggests that there is something seriously amiss with the last phases ofstandard geological chronology. Whatever is amiss is intimately associated withthe appalling extinctions, abnormal burials and the apparently endless instancesworldwide of so-called 'contradictory' (or incompatible) field evidence. Adeeper, but brief review of these chronological factors unquestionablyreinforces this impression.A Revised Geological Chronology?*->i%t*-}^<£sr-»The diverse geological and biological evidence (fossil and extant) we haveexamined thus far converges on the fact that stupendous worldwide geophysicalchanges have occurred geologically very recently. It also highlights the factthat an impressive range of plant and animal forms (each identical or nearly so)now distributed discontinu-ously in different regions of the world representfloras and faunas so lately dislocated that insufficient time has elapsed fornew species to have developed within their ranks. These changes wereevidentially sudden and violent, the present topographical conditions in theworld being their principal visible legacy - and all living things thedescendants of the animals and plants which survived them.The testimony of the fossils, moreover, reveals that biological decimations werewholesale and without regard to the biological classes, numbers, sizes, ages,sexes, or health of the victims. Many organisms perished literally where theystood, being suddenly buried erect or even in walking positions - or werepermanently frozen with singular rapidity following their demise.Thus, not only these annihilations but also the deposition of many envelopingdeposits ('drift') were catastrophically sudden. These deposits, usuallyattributed to prolonged and massive ice-action, often overspread extensivetracts of land, ignoring preexisting topography - and they are sometimesimmensely thick. Their accumulation, therefore, occurred on a colossal scale,both in terms of volume and linear extent.Extraordinary speed, huge scale, great violence and indiscriminate action aretherefore equally prominent factors in both the geologi-cal and the biological records of the period under review.Typical 'drift' deposits occur far outside allegedly glaciated regions, or,conversely, are absent from many others believed to have been heavily glaciated.Abnormally buried organic remains in otherwise typical 'drift' deposits oftenoccur in latitudes inimicable to large-scale ice-action. These are inescapablefacts strongly militating against the popular explanation of the origin of thesegreat deposits.As noted previously, a special geological 'period', the Pleistocene, was erectedby geologists expressly to embrace these formations, on the basis of the realexistence of these former glaciations. Since, however, ice-action is by naturevery slow, the time allocated for these glaciations and the resultant 'drift'accumulations has been correspondingly long. Accordingly, it has been common toreserve a span of two or more million years for the duration of the Pleistocene'period'. Such concepts are seriously at variance with the field evidence, forif the glaciations of orthodoxy (the Tee Age') never really existed, and if thesingular 'drift' deposits accredited to them were accumulated at comparativelygreat speed, then the duration of the Pleistocene epoch must actually have beenunexpectedly brief.Repeated discoveries in 'drift' deposits of mixed floras and faunas,simultaneously involve climatically-incompatible 'northern' and 'southern'species, modern and ancient biota, or forms which no longer flourish at thelatitudes where their remains now occur. These loudly proclaim a sudden andviolent extinction. The disposition of land and sea must also have differedmarkedly before the onset of these changes, and equally different135meteorological conditions formerly existed, profoundly affecting thegeographical distribution and general abundance of faunas and floras.With the elimination of an Ice Age of conventional conception, and observingthat many supposedly typical 'Ice Age' animals (eg, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,etc) were not actually well adapted to glacial conditions, the faunas and florasfound in Pleistocene 'drift' deposits must in reality have flourished during thepreceding Pliocene period (see Appendix A).The generally equable conditions characteristic of Pliocene times were highlyfavourable to the development and proliferation of life-forms of all kinds, andin that respect did not materially differ from the equally genial Miocene periodwhich preceded it. A mixture of ancient (Miocene) and less ancient (Pliocene)organisms -including allegedly Arctic species - thrived side by side, therefore,throughout Pliocene times, persisting until its brief, sudden and cataclysmicclose about 11,500 years ago -when, concomitantly with the depositionof the 'drift', they were slaughtered wholesale.For these reasons, typical Miocene and Pliocene species occur with surprisingfrequency alongside those of supposedly younger 'Pleistocene' age, or figurealongside various specially adapted organisms now enjoying geographicallydiscontinuous distribution. The occurrence of Miocene and Pliocene plants andanimals, such as Deinotherium, Hipparion, Eumetopias, and Carcharodon, in late'Pleistocene' deposits, or the survival of various living animals and plantshaving comparably ancient origins, thus ceases to surprise. We know of no otherscheme which satisfactorily or comprehensively accounts for such otherwiseanomalous biological occurrences.Instead of being a distinct geological epoch of appreciable duration, thePleistocene (as epitomised by the 'drift' formations and attendant phenomena)appears therefore to have been little more than a rather brief 'stage'. The timeallegedly occupied by the glacial and interglacial episodes of conventionalPleistocene chronology was actually non-existent. Conversely, theTable 2CRevised chronology for the Tertiary and Quaternary periods in the light of thePhaeton disasterDates based on the latest available evidencePliocene period persisted to very much more recent times than has hitherto beencommonly supposed.The unique character of the 'drift' deposits, the 'erratics', 'rochesmoutonnees', and supposed glacial striations, however, is such thatthey merit a distinctive chronological 'compartment'. The term 'Pleistocene' istherefore retained as a 'stage' rather than an 'epoch' appellation, and is giventhat stature in the chronological revision summarised above in table 2C.REFERENCESl.Jack, R L. 1877. \"Glacial Drift in the North-Eastern Carpathians\", Q // GeolSoc Lond, vol 33, pp673-681; see p673.2.

The study of such material,however, is fraught with difficulties, especially as it is basicallyunsusceptible to scientific tests or duplication, and the problem of attachinguniversally acceptable meanings to it a vexatious one. That alternative avenuesof approach exist merely compounds the problem.Probably the easiest and most naive method is to treat every account as achildren's tale or an ingenious fabrication designed simply to instruct orentertain. Another method views all traditions as symbolical, in which case theidentification of the symbols will vary from solar deities, nature spirits andguardian entities to rather vague concepts of good and evil reflective offashions prevailing at different times. Yet another is to evaluate traditions asincredible profane or religious explanations of otherwise normal eventsinexplicable to early man. Still another approach categorises such material asfragmented memories of once-real people and events, and therefore as genuineechoes of primeval history. It would, of course, be wrong to presume that everytradition falls into just one of these categories. The strongest probability isthat all the various approaches just outlined are valid for different groups oftraditions.At this juncture a particularly relevant factor, pinpointed as long ago as 1894by Ignatius Donnelly, claims attention. Donnelly noted:...we find the legends of the primitive American Indians adhering quite closelyto the events of the past, while the myths thatsurvive at all among the civilised nations of Europe are found in garbled forms,and only among the peasantry of remote districts 1 .This distinction between traditions preserved by primitive and cultured peoplesis of considerable importance, particularly as many readers will appreciatethat:Legend has one great foe to its perpetuation - civilisation. Civilisation bringswith it a contempt for everything which it cannot understand; skepticism becomesthe synonym for intelligence; men no longer repeat - they doubt, they dissect,they sneer, they reject, they invent. If the myth survives this treatment, thepoets take it up and make it their stock-in-trade - they decorate it in amasquerade of frippery and finery, feathers and furbelows, like a clown dressedfor a fancy ball; and the poor barbarian legend survives at last, if it survivesat all, like the Conflagration in Ovid, or King Arthur in Tennyson - ahippopotamus smothered in flowers, jewels and laces... 2 .A further point concerns the superficial simplicity, even naivete, of manytraditions. For the initial compilers and purveyors of traditions to convey inclear and unambiguous terms often quite elaborate original concepts and sagas toessentially illiterate mass audiences, it was necessary for these traditions tobe presented in simplified or general form. The resultant statements weretherefore frequently abrupt or terse, and tended to emphasise the more easilycomprehended effects rather than technically complex causes - even assuming thatthose too were ever understood. Conversely, complicatedTable 3AGeographical distribution of traditions of the Deluge and Great CatastropheA selection of the 500 or more known examples, compiled from numerous sources.The survivors of the Flood in all the legends range from a single individual toa small group.

These, we shall find, mention numerous aspects and local details suchas could be hardly imagined or invented had they not actually been witnessed orexperienced. This feature of the traditions will become particularly prominentin Part Five of this book.It is uncertain how many separate catastrophe traditions exist, although thetotal certainly amounts to many hundreds. They are broadly divisible into thosewhich describe a terrible conflagration, and those which record an all-embracingflood, usually identified with Noah's Deluge. In almost every case, theconflagration is said to have preceded the flood, which then extinguished it.With the exception of Antarctica, catastrophe traditions are known from everycontinent, the Americas furnishing the largest number and Africa the fewest(table 3A). Their geographical distribution reveals theabsurdity of the efforts made in some quarters to show that the Delugetraditions were entirely derived from the scriptural story of Noah asdisseminated by Christian missionaries. As a general explanation it failsmiserably. Yet the notion of a vast flood was evidently so ingrained in humanmemory that it could not be forgotten 3 . It must, therefore, have been an eventeither of the most recent past or of exceptional proportions and severity.An important feature in many of these traditions is that the cause of thesecalamities was one or more cosmic bodies, which in simple terms engaged in a'war in heaven'. That such a seemingly preposterous idea is common in so manydifferent legends raises the question as to why numerous often-unrelated peoplesshould even share such a remembrance when no such celestial 'war' has beenobserved in historical times. The only conclusion that can be arrived at is thatthe disaster described in these traditions did actually occur, and made such anindelible impression upon the few survivors of the event that accounts of itwere carefully preserved down to our own times as the most enduring of memories.In reviewing the cataclysmic saga represented by these legends, we shall brieflyexamine each of the main themes individually, as exemplified below.ConflagrationS~-i*QL£.i-tJgS?->The effects produced by a great world conflagration accompanying huge tectonicupheavals are graphically described in many traditions and written accounts,such as that bequeathed to us by Ovid. Ovid tells how a celestial body, calledPhaeton, approaches Earth so that:The earth bursts into flame, the highest parts first, and splits into deepcracks, and its moisture is all dried up. The meadows are burned to white ashes;the trees are consumed, green leaves and all, and the ripe grain furnishes fuelfor its own destruction... great cities perish with theirwalls and vast conflagration reduces whole nations to ashes 4 .*In his work Theogony, the classical Greek writer Hesiod clearly described theeffects of this great conflagration which, preceding the Flood, was attributedto a celestial body called Typhon (another name for Phaeton). Another writer,Apollodorus, furnished further details stating that Typhon:...out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars... Suchand so great was Typhon when, hurling kindled rocks, he made for the very heavenwith hissing and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth... at MountHaemus he heaved whole mountains... a stream of blood gushed out of the mountain5 .The Typhon legend was especially connected with pre-dynastic Egypt, where Typhonwas also called Set h , another name for the biblical Satan. The Roman writer,Pliny, described Typhon:A terrible comet was seen by the people of Ethiopia and Egypt, to which Typhon,the king of that period, gave his name; it had a fiery appearance and wastwisted like a coil, and it was very grim to behold; it was not really a star somuch as what might be called a ball of fire 7 .+* See Note i. t See Note 5.Strabo records that the Egyptian shore of the Red Sea was once called Typhonia s. Interestingly, an old Arab tradition asserts that: \"...the Red Sea is simplywater that did not dry up after Noah's Deluge'\"*.Other effects produced by the great heat associated with this conflagration arecommon to many flood traditions. For example, from Persia, we have the statementthat: \"The sea boiled, and all the shores of the ocean boiled, and all of themiddle of it boiled\" 10 . The cause of this heating was ascribed to the 'star'Tistrya, \"the leader of the stars against the planets\" 11 - note that more thanone 'star' is indicated; and it was accompanied by an incredibly violenthurricane 12 . In another tradition, Tistrya: \"...let a stream of fire flowtoward the earth... (and) filled our world with its devouring heat\" 13 .Several North American traditions refer specifically to the phenomenon ofsuperheated water: \"Great clouds appeared... such a great heat came, thatfinally the water boiled. People jumped into the streams and lakes to coolthemselves, and died\" 14 . Further south, on the Pacific coast, other Amerindianlegends state that: \"It grew very hot... many animals jumped into the water tosave themselves, but the water began to boil\" 15 . Although initially somewhatfanciful, these assertions will later be found to be entirely consistent withthe chain of physical effects that such an appalling calamity must inevitablyhave engendered.Flood«Tss±***±*sr»According to several traditions, there ./A. were two floods - the Flood ofDeucalion and the Flood of Ogyges 16 -and many writers, both ancient and modern,confused by this, have tried to determine when these floods actually occurred.WasNoah's Deluge the Deucalion or the Ogygian Flood? Did the latter occur in the5th millennium BC, and was the Flood of Deucalion an earlier event? CommynsBeaumont (Appian Way) is emphatic on this point:...The story of Phaeton is undoubtedly the account of a very remarkablecelestial event, which left behind it certain terrestrial effects. Tatian,Clement and Eusebius all agreed that the Phaeton event was identical with theDeucalion flood. 17The Genesis account of Noah's Deluge is, perhaps, the most familiar of all knownFlood traditions, although when compared with other versions of the event it isobviously incomplete. It also gives no inkling as to its real cause, merelystating that it was divinely ordained. The Book of Revelation, however,associates the catastrophe with Satan as the cause of this 18 , adding that,after a 'war in heaven', Satan was \"cast out of heaven ontoEarth\", whereupon a great flood issued from his mouth and drowned the wholeworld.The great Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh, from which the Biblical account ofNoah's Flood is derived, or shared a common origin' g , contains details notincluded in the Genesis version. It refers to a great \"hail from heaven\" and atremendous whirlwind or cyclone which \"swept up to heaven\" accompanying a floodthat \"swiftly mounted up... to the mountains\" 20 . Sanskrit versions allude tothe same effects 21 .Other flood traditions, examined more fully later, describe the Deluge as averitable water-mountain, as a stupendous wall of water, or as an irresistiblefoaming watery avalanche. Few, if any, liken it to an ordinary, steadily rising,riverine flood. It was something special.Celestial Disorderf-^s^a-iizzznIn Ovid's account of this catastrophe, we learn that the Chariot of the Sun,driven by Phaeton, moved \"no longer in the same course as before\", that thehorses pulling it broke \"loose from their course\" and \"rushed aimlessly,knocking against the stars set deep in the sky and snatching the chariot throughuncharted ways\", and that the constellations of the Cold Bears tried to plungeinto the ocean 22 .This description of stellar movement is exactly what an observer on Earth wouldsee if the geographical poles were moving or, put another way, if an axial tiltwas in progress. That this is what Ovid implied, is borne out later in hisaccount when he wrote how Phaeton complained:...the heavens are carried round with a constant rotation, carrying with themthe lofty stars, and whirl them with rapid motion. Against this I have tocontend; and thatforce which overcomes all other things does not overcome me, and I am carried ina contrary direction to the rapid world. 23Ancient Chinese texts also apparently confirm an axial derangement:...the pillars supporting the sky crumbled and the chains from which the earthwas suspended shivered to pieces. Sun, moon and stars poured down into thenorthwest, where the sky became low; rivers, seas and oceans rushed down to thesoutheast, where the earth sank. A great conflagration burst out. Flood raged.Wild beasts and terrible birds made men their prey.. 24On the other side of the world, the Pawnee Indians of America preservedessentially similar memories of a remote time when the North Polar star and theSouth Polar star \"changed places\" or \"went to visit eachother\" 25 ; while, further north, the Greenland Eskimos informed earlymissionaries that ages ago the Earth \"turned over\" 26 .The consequence of a tilting of the terrestrial axis, as suggested in thesetraditions, would mean the displacement of the world's oceans. Severaltraditions actually refer to such dreadful effects:The ocean, too, is contracted, and that which lately was sea is a surface ofparched sand, and the mountains which the deep sea has covered start up andincrease the number of scattered Cyclades [islands]; the fishes sink to thebottom, and the crooked dolphins do not care to raise themselves on the surfacefor air as usual. The bodies of the sea-calves float lifeless on their backs onthe top of the water. 27And:Why do the seas delivered to him by lot decrease, and why do they recede stillfarther from the sky? ...look around on either side, see how each pole issmoking; and if the fire shall injure them, thy palace will fall in ruins. See!Atlas himself is struggling, and hardly can he bear the glowing heavens on hisshoulders. 28Another interesting account of world devastation is found in the ancient Norsetexts, the Elder Edda and the Prose Edda, in the saga known as Ragnarok. Thename itself is significant for, according to Anderson 21 *, it means 'thedarkness of the gods'. However, Donnelly suggested that it could also mean regn= rain, and rok = smoke or dust, hence 'rain of dust' - the rain of dust, ashes,sand and stones mentioned in numerous legends from other countries 30 .This Norse saga implies, like Ovid's account, that at least two bodies wereinvolved in the catastrophe, and passed close to Earth 'devouring' the sun andthe moon:Tlien happens that which will seem a greatmiracle; Tliat the wolf devours the sun, and thiswill seem a great loss.The other wolf devours the moon, And this, too, will cause great mischief. Thestars shall be hurled from heaven.The effect of this 'mischief was:Then it shall come to pass that the earthwill shake so violently That the trees will he torn up by the roots, TJiemountains will topple down, And all bonds and fetters ivill be brokenand snapped. The Fenris-wolf (the name given to one ofthe assailants) gets loose. The sea rushes over the earth, For theMidgdrd-serpent (the name of theother assailant) ivrithes in giant rage, And seeks to gain the land.and: \"As they ride over Bifrost it breaks to pieces...\" (Elder Edda).The location of Bifrost is uncertain, but later we will suggest its possibleformer geographical site.Another important point in Ovid's account concerns Phaeton's direction of flightwhen nearest Earth:*The moon, too, wonders that her brother's horses run lower than her own, and thescorched clouds send forth smoke. 31With the result that Phaeton's 'chariot' (apparently a cosmic companion)disintegrates:...But the omnipotent father, having called the gods to witness, and him, too,who had given the chariot to Phaeton, that unless he gives assistance all thingswill perish in direful ruin, mounts aloft to the highest eminence... from whichhe moves his thunders, and hurls the brandished lightnings.He thundered aloud, and darted the poised lightning from his right ear, againstthe charioteer, and at the same moment deprived him both of life and his seat,and by his ruthless fires restrained the flames. The horses are afrighted, and,making a bound in the opposite direction, they shake the yoke from their necks,and disengagethemselves from the torn harness. In one place lie the reins, in another theaxle-tree wrenched from the pole, in another part are the spokes of the brokenwheels, and the fragments of the chariot torn in pieces are scattered far andwide. But Phaeton, the flames consuming his yellow hair, is hurled headlong, andis borne on a track through the air, as sometimes a star is seen to fall fromthe serene sky, although it really has not fallen 32 .This disintegration is remembered in many traditions. The Ute Indians ofCalifornia state that it was the result of a conflict between two brilliantcelestial bodies named Ta-vi and Ta-wats. Ta-vi, like Phaeton, is alleged tohave roamed the heavens on an erratic course, but when it approached too closeto Ta-wats a fight ensued and:...the sun was shivered into a thousand fragments, which fell to earth causing ageneral conflagration. Then Ta-wats fled before the destruction he had wrought,and as he fled the burning earth consumed his feet, consumed his legs, consumedhis body, consumed his hands and arms - all were consumed but the head alone,which bowled across valleys and over mountains, fleeing destruction from theburning earth,until at last, swollen with heat, the eyes of the god burst and the tears gushedforth in a flood which spread over the earth and extinguished the fire. 33That portions of objects engaged in celestial conflict fell to Earth iscontained in many early traditions and writings. Herodotus states that the finalstruggle between Typhon and Zeus occurred over the coastal route from Egypt toPalestine 34 . Referring to Syrian memories of this drama, Strabo wrote thatTyphon: \"...when struck by the bolts of lightning fled in search of a descentunderground\" 35 . However, Apollonius Rhodius states that: \"...smitten by thebolt of Zeus, [Typhon] lies whelmed beneath the waters of the Serbonian lake\" 36.Another facet recorded in some traditions concerns the fearful noise thataccompanied this disintegration. A very early Arabian tradition mentions how thelegendary 'Irem of the Columns' was, in one fateful day, destroyed by athunderous noise and fiery blast from heaven 37 . Hindu texts contain anotherreference to these aerial explosions: \"...the 'boar-form' (Phaeton) suddenlyuttered a sound like the loudest thunder, and the echo reverberated and shookall the quarters of the Universe\" 38 .Terrestrial Chaose-^iiL±.fij&zZ-iThat Phaeton caused major changes to world topography is mentioned by manytraditions. The Samoan islanders, for instance, assert that:Islands] arose out of the womb of the last earth. 39Likewise a Tahitian tradition states:...The sea ...arose, and in a stupendous catastrophe of nature the land sankinto the sea... The new earth [the SamoanIn ancient times Taaroa, the principal god, according to their mythology, thecreator of the world, being angry withmen on account of their disobedience to his will, overturned the world into thesea, when the earth sank into the water, excepting a few aurus [projectingpoints] which remained above its surface, constituting the present clusters ofislands. 40The last two traditions suggest that these Pacific islands were once part of alarge now-vanished continent. A pre-Columbian Maya manuscript, known as theTroana Codex, apparently describes its destruction:...there occurred terrible earthquakes, which continued without interruptionuntil the 13th Chuen. The country of the hills of mud, the land of Mu, wassacrificed: being twice upheaved it suddenly disappeared during the night, thebasin being continually shaken by the volcanic forces. Being confined, thesecaused the land to sink, and to rise several times in various places. At lastthe surface gave way and ten countries were torn asunder and scattered. Unableto stand the force of the convulsion, they sank with their 64,000,000 ofinhabitants 8060 years before the writing of this book. 41Although little credence is usually given to this account, Hawaiian traditionsmaintain:The belief of the Hawaiians of ancient times was that there was one greatcontinent, stretching from Hawaii, including Samoa, Lalakoa (the Hawaiianversion of Rarotonga) and reaching as far as New Zealand, also taking in Fiji,and there were some lowlands in between these higher lands. All this was calledby one name Ka-houpo-o-Kane, the Solar-Plexus of Kane, and was also calledMoana-nui-kai-oo, the Great Engulfing Ocean. 42 *The Mixtecs of Mexico in their myths speak of a now-vanished land to the east ofthe present American coast:...In a single day all was lost, even the mountains sank into the water...subsequently there came a great deluge in which many of the sons and daughtersof the gods perished. 41This reference to the submergence of extensive land in the Atlantic Oceansuggests that it might have been the Atlantis of Plato's Timaeus and Critias. Ina lengthy narrative, Plato wrote:The ocean (Atlantic) there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouthwhich you Greeks call, as you say, 'the Pillars of Heracles', there lay anisland which was larger than Libya and Asia (Asia Minor) together; and it waspossible for the travellers of that time to cross from it to the other islands,and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them whichencompasses that veritable ocean... Yonder is a real ocean, and the landsurrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, acontinent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation ofkings, a great and marvellous power, which held sway over all the island, andover many other islands also and parts of the continent; and, moreover, of thelands here within the Straits (of Gibraltar) they ruled over Libya as far asEgypt and over Europe as far as Tuscany...At a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and onegrievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of... the island ofAtlantis was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean atthat spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by theshoal mud which the island created as it settled down. 44Referring to this last statement, Babcock remarked: \"It must be evident thatPlato would not have written thus unless he relied on the established generalrepute ofthat part of the ocean for difficulty of navigation 4 *.References to what may also have been a former continent in the Indian Oceanoccur in several south Asian traditions. One from Sri Lanka avers:...in a former age the citadel of Rawana, 25 palaces and 400,000 streets wereswallowed by the sea... The submerged land was between Tuticoreen and Manaar,and Manaar is all that is now left of what was once a large territory. Thislegend, notwithstanding the manifest exaggeration as to the extent of theinjury, may be founded on fact, as the Hindu and other nations have a similartradition, and suppose that 'Ceylon was then much larger than it is at present'.46Even the Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago (off southern Burma) refer to such acontinent:...formerly their country was of continental dimensions. But the daughter of anevil spirit threw many rocks into the sea. Thereupon the waters rose andswallowed up all the land. Everything alive perished, except what was able tosave itself on one island that remained above the waters. The forefathers of theSelungs then practised great magic and this caused the waters to fall. Thenother islands arose which the Selungs have inhabited ever since. 47The impression gained from reading such traditions is one of actual eye-witnessreports of the catastrophe. Thus the Kato Indians of California describe how:Every day it rained, every night it rained. All the people slept. The sky fell.The land was not. For a very great distance there was no land. The waters of theoceans came together. Animals of all kinds drowned. Where the water went therewere no trees... Human beings and animals alike had been washed away... It wasvery dark... 48Among the Hopi Indians of the American south-west are echoes of a similar memoryin which, rather interestingly, there is, as also implied in Genesis 67 ,mention of violent seismic activity. The account asserts that the 'big waterserpent deity' was angry and:...turned the world upside down, and water spouted up through the kivas [sunkensacred dwellings] and through the fireplaces of houses. The earth was rent ingreat chasms, and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud; andacross this the serpent deity told all the people to travel. As they journeyedacross, the feet of the bad slipped and they fell into the dark water, but thegood, after many days, reached dry land... 49Although mainly localised, many traditions clearly refer to great seismicactivity. For example, from Peru we learn:Legend says that in those days of the jaguar-faced gods called huaca, the Andeswere split apart and the callejon was formed, when the sky made war on theearth. 50And from Brazil:The lightnings flashed and the thunders roared terribly and all were afraid.Then the heaven burst and the fragments fell down and killed everything andeverybody. Heaven and Earth changed places. Nothing that had life was left uponthe earth.' 1Perhaps the most remarkable of all such records is that of the Zuni Indians,which graphically describes the aftermath of the catastrophe:As it was with the men and the creatures, so it was with the world. It was youngand unripe. Unstable its surface was, like that of a marsh; dank, even the highplaces like the floors of a cavern, so that seeds dropped on it sprang forth,and eventhe substance of offal became growing things.Earthquakes shook the world and rent it... Creatures turned fierce, becomingbeasts of prey, wherefore others turned timid, becoming their quarry;wretchedness and hunger abounded, black magic, war and contention entered whenfear did into the hearts of men and creatures. Yea, fear was everywhere amongthem, wherefore, everywhere the people, hugging in dread their preciouspossessions, became wanderers... living on the seeds of grasses, eaters of thedead and slain things..!Dread was the din and stir. The heights staggered and the mountains reeled, theplains boomed and crackled under the floods and fires, and the high hollowplaces [caves], hugged of men and the creatures, were black and awful, so thatthese grew crazed with panic and strove alike to escape or to hide more deeply.But erewhile they grew deafened and deadened, forgetful and asleep. A treelighted of lightning burns not long.Presently thick rain fell, quenching the fires; and waters washed the face ofthe world, cutting deep trains from the heights downward, and scattered abroadthe wrecks and corpses of stricken things and beings, or burying them deeply.Lo! they are seen in the mountains to this day; and, in the trails of thosefierce waters, cool rivers now run, and where monsters perished lime of theirbones [aluwe - calcareous nodules in malpais or volcanic tuff: F H Cushing] wefind, and use in food stuff. Gigantic they were, for their forms little or greatwere often shrivelled or contorted into stone. Seen are these also along thedepths of the world. Where they huddled together and were blasted thus, theirblood gushed forth and flowed deeply [due to sudden raising of temperatures toabnormal levels rupturing blood vessels?], here in rivers, there in floods; butit was charged and blistered and blackened by fires, into the black rocks of thelowermesas apkwina, lava or malpais: F H Cushing].There were vast plains of dust, ashes and cinders, reddened as in the mud of ahearth-place. There were great banks of clay and soil burned to hardness - asclay is when baked in the kiln-mound - blackened, bleached or stained yellow,grey, red or white, streaked and banded, bended or twisted. Worn and broken bythe heavings of the underworld and by the waters and breaths of the ages, theyare the mountain-terraces of the Earth-Mother, 'dividing country from country'.Yet many were the places behind and between these - dark canyons, deep valleys,sunken plains - unharmed by the fires, where they swerved or rolled higher - as,close to the track of a forest fire, green grow trees and grasses, and evenflowers continue to bloom. Therein... tarried the people. Dry and more stablewas the world now, less fearsome its lonely places; since changed to rock wereso many monsters of prey, some shrivelled to the size of insects; made preciousas amulets for the hunter and warrior, as told in other talks of our ancientspeech\". 52Prof J W Gregory recorded native folklore from all along the Great Rift Valleyin Africa, which refers to a remote period characterised by immense physicalchanges. He observed:...The Somali say that when their ancestors crossed from Arabia to Africa therewas a land connection between the two, across the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Thenatives of Ujiji, at the southern end of the line, have a folklore that goesback to the time when Lake Tanganyika was formed by the flooding of a fertileplain, rich in cattle and plantations... There is geological evidence to showthat great earth movements have happened along this Rift Valley, as it may betermed, at a recent date, which makes it distinctly probable that thesetraditions are recollections of geographical changes. 53 (Our italics).Darknessf-*r*s£*v<-!&zr»Many catastrophe traditions refer to the coming of unnaturally prolongeddarkness. The Central American Aztecs preserved such an account:The third sun is called Quia-Tonatiuh, sun of rain, because there fell a rain offire; all which existed burned; and there fell a rain of gravel. Now, this wasin the year Ce Tecpalt, One Flint, it was the day Nahui-Quiahuitl, Fourth Rain.Now in this day, in which men were lost and destroyed in a rain of fire, theywere transformed into goslings; the sun itself was on fire, and everything,together with the houses was consumed. 54....a tremendous hurricane that carried away trees, mounds, houses and thelargest edifices, notwithstanding which many men and women escaped, principallyin caves and places where the great hurricane could not reach them. All thistime they were in darkness, without seeing the light of the sun, nor the moon,that the wind had brought them. 55And:After the destruction of the fourth sun, the world plunged into darkness duringthe space of twenty-five years. Amid this profound obscurity, ten years beforethe appearance of the fifth sun, mankind was regenerated. 56In British Columbia, Canada, the Akawais remember in their traditions a periodof pro-longed darkness, and the intense cold it caused, at the time of an immenseworld-sculpting flood 57 .Commenting on this phenomenon de Bourbourg remarked:A vast night reigned over all the American land, of which tradition speaksunanimously: in a sense the sun no longer existed for this ruined world whichwas lighted up at intervals only by frightful conflagrations, revealing the fullhorror of their situation to the small number of human beings that had escapedfrom these calamities. 58 *Japanese and Hawaiian traditions recall a time of continuous darkness too 59 .An ancient Hawaiian rhyme runs:The earth is dancing...Let darkness cease...The heavens are enclosing...Finished is the world of Haivaii. wIn Samoan traditions low clouds appear to have enveloped the world and plungedit into darkness. It was during this period that the islands of Samoa, Tonga,Rotuma, Wallis and Fotuna were upheaved from the bed of the ocean 61 . Duringthese events, the Samoans insist that the \"heavens fell down\" and were so lowthat people could not stand upright without touching them - a belief also heldby Amerindian nations and the Dusan tribe of Borneo 62 .Hail and Fire«^a^fe-rf A? ^T^Several traditions associate great falls of hail, ice, fire, dust and othersubstances with the aforementioned calamities, and clearly accord them celestialorigins. Thus, in one account we read:And every island fled away and the mountains were not found. And there fell uponmen a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: andmen blasphemed God because of the plague of hail; for the plague thereof wasexceeding great. 63These were not icy hailstones, but probably the 'stones of barad' crashing outof the sky and mentioned in the Book of Joshua. But the coming of ice isreferred to in the Old Testament:From whose womb did the ice come forth, And who has given birth to the hoarfrostof heaven? The water became hard like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.64From Finland, the epic Kalevala describes falls of 'hailstones of iron' from thesky when the sun and moon had 'disappeared', and the world was sprinkled with'red milk' 65 . This 'red milk' or 'blood' appears in many other legends (eg,Mount Haemus) relating to this catastrophe and appears to have a scientificexplanation, which will be referred to later.* It would seem that the ancientsconsidered the destruction of Adamite man to have come from heaven in the formof fire, torrential rain, stones and ice.8Ice-bound«TS^)fe-j4i>i^»As previously mentioned, the formation of .ZJLwidespread ice was indicated inthe Old Testament. More interestingly the Norse sagas provide fuller details ofthe onset of such conditions follozving the departure or demise of the FenrisWolf and Midgard Serpent:First there is a winter called the Fimbul winter, the mighty, the great, theiron winter, when snow drives from all quarters, the frosts are so severe, thewinds so keen,that there is no joy in the sun. There are three such winters in succession,without any intervening summer... as soon as the streams that are called Elivogs[rivers from under ice] had come so far that the venomous yeast which flowedwith them hardened, as does dross that runs from the fire, then it turned intoice. And when this ice stopped and flowed no more, then gathered over it thedrizzling rain that arose from the venom and froze into rime, and one layer ofice was laid upon anotherclear into Ginungagap. All that part of Ginungagap that turns to the north wasfilled with thick and heavy ice and rime, and everywhere within were drizzlingrain and gusts. But the south part of Ginungagap was lightened up by the glowingsparks that flew out of Muspelheim. (Prose Edda).Part Three: The Enduring Memory 161Again, the location of Ginungagap is uncertain. It may, however, have stretchedfrom Norway to the north and west, or connected Greenland and Vinland (NorthAmerica) 66 .*Numerous other traditions could be cited which refer to a period of sudden grimcold afflicting early Man, although those mentioned must suffice.* See Note 10.The Traditions Assessed«^«**.j.*is«r»Undoubtedly the scientific acceptability of these ancient recollections asgenuine evidence for the reality of former events is decidedly limited, since bytheir very nature they are inherently unscientific. Nevertheless, these samememories, when assessed collectively, consistently appear to describe a mostamazing episode of Earth history upon which orthodoxy, represented by astronomy,geology and archaeology, has so far remained largely silent. It is, in fact,this internal consistency of these memories which - irrespective of the originalgeographical or cultural source of the material - is so impressive. Whateverelse may be thought of these traditions it is certain that they cannot just beswept aside as being of no consequence, for, within their limitations, theyconstitute an eloquent testimony to a truly momentous chapter of events.Consider, for example, the Deluge.It has often been argued that the many Deluge traditions actually derive from asingle original version, later disseminated worldwide. As shown more fully inPartFour, several accounts, referring to either Autumnal or Vernal elements,indicate the season of the Deluge's occurrence. Autumn in the northernhemisphere is Springtime in the southern. Only truly independent recollectionswould contain such superficially contradictory yet geographically correctdetails. Records of this kind also strongly emphasise the genuinely globalextent of this watery calamity.Table 3B summarises major issues traceable in the traditions globally. If thesetraditions constitute racial memories and eye-witness accounts of the sameenormous topographical changes as have been discussed in Part One, and theterrible biological extinctions and decimations reviewed in Part Two, theyrepresent highly important supplementary records of those calamitous events.Indeed, they form the third prong of a trident-like register comprisinggeology/palaeontology, botany/zoology and tradition/legend. That all three tellvirtually the same story is surely not fortuitous!Table 3BTraditions specifying particular catastrophic effects.Europe and AsiaTable 3B (Continued)Traditions specifying particular catastrophic effects.The AmericasTable 3B (Continued)Traditions specifying particular catastrophic effects.Australasia, Oceania and AfricaREFERENCES1.

Yetis the message of these cited dates actually true or mere deception? Indeed,what evidence if any genuinely exists which validates even a general date forthis calamity?Several avenues of approach exist which permit us to pinpoint with reasonableconfidence not only the probable century but, rather surprisingly, the time ofyear when this debacle occurred.Viewed scientifically, the most reliable line of enquiry involves our ability toCarbon-14 date with very fair accuracy the remains of countless animals andplants overwhelmed by the event. Conventionally, of course, these remains arecommonly assigned a 'late Pleistocene' antiquity and the many radiocarbon datesthey have yielded (see Appendix B) are usually regarded as marking the finalWeichselian/Wisconsinian phase of alleged 'Ice Age' times (see table 1A).What, however, are radiocarbon dates?In 1939, Serge Korff discovered the existence of radiocarbon. He noticed thatcosmic neutrons, on reaching Earth's upper atmosphere from outer space, producedsecondary neutrons on their initial collision with the naturally pre-existingnitrogen occurring at high altitude. Korff predicted that the neutrons, oncolliding with the abundant isotope Nitrogen-14, would react to release a protonand form radioactive Carbon-14 (C 14 ). Thiscarbon, he reasoned further, would then combine with oxygen to produce C' 4 0 2/which is ultimately absorbed by all living matter. Plants absorb it throughphotosynthesis, and animals (if they are herbivorous) by consuming plant-food or(if they are carnivorous) by devouring herbivores who habitually ingestCarbon-14-impregnated plant-food. New C 14 , furthermore, is continuously addedto the Earth's supply about as rapidly as the old dissipates.During the years immediately following World War II, Dr W F Libby developed andrefined Korff's method, one of the fundamental premises of which is theassumption that, when an organism dies, it ceases to assimilate C 14 , and theradiocarbon already present within it decays without further C 14 replacing it.The rate of decay, or number of disintegrations per minute when measured by aGeiger counter, decreases with the increasing age of the sample concerned, withonly one half of the original number occurring when the C 14 is 5,568 (±30)years old. This is the 'half-life' of Carbon-14. With so brief a half-life it isobvious that the process represents a radioactive clock, of enormous importanceand value to the prehistorian concerned with events no older than about 50,000years. As geological phenomena and organic remains relegated to late 'Ice Age'times mostly fall within a span of time appreciably younger than this critical50,000-year datum, C 14 is clearly an exceptionally useful tool for determiningwith fair precision the actual ages of the remains of individual plants andanimals collected from this segment of Earth history.While C 14 appears, theoretically, to be an ideal dating technique, it has notalways proved so in practice. It has certain drawbacks. Far from being a simplelaboratoryprocess, various factors exists which sometimes profoundly affect results,particularly those concerning material older than 5,000 years or so ago.Originally it was assumed that the rate of cosmic neutron arrival was constant.If that were so, then the rate of C 14 production and the rate of C 14 decaywould have reached a natural balance long ago. This has not occurred. It has, infact, been established that C 14 production has fluctuated appreciably duringthe last 6,000 years 1 , even though the rate of decay has probably remainedunchanged. Similar fluctuations may also have occurred at other times during thelast 50,000 years before the last six millennia.Hence, organic remains relegated to the aforementioned period quite oftenexhibit significant discrepancies between the C 14 levels they contain, withconsequent effect on the dates derived from these. Not unexpectedly, thevariation becomes progressively larger the older the material involved.Notwithstanding such factors, many previous writers used C 14 dates to determinethe time when the 'Pleistocene' epoch ended and the Holocene began. Broadlyspeaking, the resultant dates exhibit remarkable general unanimity.Those obtained for late Weichselian terrestrial plants and marine shells fromvarious localities in north-western Europe by Mangerud and Gullikson all fellwithin the period (13,000-11,000 years BP 2 ), while a strikingly similar date -13,500-11,000 years BP, based solely upon an interpretation of C 14 datedgeological features - was established for the demise of a 'late Pleistocene'mastodon discovered in peat-bog deposits near Michigan City, Indiana, USA 3 .(These 'Before Present' dates are measured, more precisely, from AD 1950, thedate chosen by a Cambridge conference in 1962). These agreed closely with theaverage C 14 date - 11,335 (±170 years) BP - of organic remains collected fromthe basin of the Yenisei River in Siberia, and thought to possibly date fromearliest Holocene times 4 .Although nineteen C' 4 dates, ranging from 12,168 (±1,500 years) BP to 10,090(±140 years) BP yielded by animal and plantremains scattered across the northern hemisphere gave a mean age of 10,918 yearsBP for the end of the Ice Age in which the original organisms supposedly lived,this date was felt to.be \"probably about 300 years too low\" 5 . Theappropriately adjusted date, 11,218 years BP, compared favourably with the'average' Siberian date noted above, and suggests that the latter was probablyvery 'late Pleistocene' rather than early Holocene.11,218 years BP also agrees well with the \"within a few centuries of 11,300 BP\"date advocated by Webb and Bryson for important climatic and botanical changestraced at the end of the supposed 'late glacial' episode in northern Mid-WestUSA 6 . Again, the final 'deglaciation' of Airport Lake on Unmak Island in theAleutians has been likewise dated as occurring between 12,000 and 11,000 yearsBP 7 , and of the southern flanks of the Brooks Range on mainland Alaska atapproximately 11,800 years BP 8 .Almost identical 'general' C 14 dates have been obtained for a variety ofsignificant physical and biological changes traceable all over the southernhemisphere. Thus, a sea level rise around Nelson Bay, Cape Province, SouthAfrica, coincided with the disappearance of dominant grassland on the adjacenthinterland sometime between 12,000 and 11,000 years ago\". Further eastward,during the same time interval, rain forests rapidly expanded acrossnorth-eastern Queensland, Australia, simultaneously with an increase in rainfall(100-175% more than experienced there today) which also affected West Irian (NewGuinea) to the north, and the east African countries of Uganda and Kenya 10 .Not surprisingly, such climate changes induced variations in growth patternsamong various organisms. Thus, very 'late Quaternary' marine bivalves fromArctic Canada exhibit marked variations in the oxygen and carbon isotopiccompositions of their shells\", signifying the occurrence then of profoundsea-temperature changes too 12 .Suffice it here to say that globally scattered datable material, universallyregarded as of terminal 'Pleistocene' or earliest Holocene age, and as diverseas the remains of vertebrates, molluscs, plants, geological features,climatic and oceanic changes, so-called 'deglaciation' processes, and isotopicgrowth patterns in bivalves, everywhere points to the same 'general' date of11,500 years BP. The additional evidence comprising the bulk of Appendix Bsubstantiates that conclusion very forcefully.Of special importance is the fact that the host of individual studies which havecontributed to this 'general' date have been conducted independently ondifferent material from widely-sundered localities over a period of severaldecades in different continents, both north and south of the equator. The resultare thus not only broadly-based but stress the remarkable consistency of thisclass of evidence.Yet, irrespective of the enormous scientific promise of radiocarbon datinggenerally, the very process embraces special problems. One of these is thecontamination of samples worldwide by the release of atomic particles into theatmosphere since nuclear bomb tests began in 1945. Allowances have therefore tobe made for the fact that \"since 1962 atomic bomb testing has completelydisturbed the natural C 14 activity\" 13 . Today, this element has always to beallowed for when new radiocarbon datings are calculated 14Other anomalies also sometimes occur. The following selection of these is worthconsidering, if only to demonstrate the many difficulties confronting scientistsspecialising in Quaternary chronologies. Some of the details are mostinstructive.Certain mammoth remains from gravel deposits in east Norway have furnished C 14dates ranging from 19,000 years BP to more than 46,000 years BP. The gravels,however, apparently date from so-called terminal 'Pleistocene' times, so theinterpretation of evidence like this must be that \"...all the remains have beenredeposited and lie in young deposits\" 15 . Again, foraminifera inorganically-rich 'late Pleistocene' mud cored at Santa Cruz, California, areseemingly much older than the mud itself. The conclusion must be that theseorganisms were entombed in it by an agent which eroded them out of some olderstratum and reburied them when it deposited the mud 16 .Analogous cases involve timber debris. Radiocarbon dated wood from channelinfill deposits on the floor of the North Sea, for example, appear to beconsiderably older than the host sediments 17 . In USA, coniferous wood from'drift' deposits at Appleton, Wisconsin, yielded a date of 12,000 ±300 years BPwhen processed in 1965, whereas earlier attempts to date the same piece of woodproduced entirely different dates -10,856 ±410 years, 11,471 ±500, 10,241 ±650and 11,830 ±100 years BP 18 .A comparable instance concerned wood collected from late Wisconsonian silt atReady Bullion Creek, Alaska. One piece of wood was dated at 11,000 ±350 yearsBP, while a tree-root found at the same horizon at the same site turned out tobe appreciably younger - 10,450 ±150 years BP 19 - younger in fact than thesupposed antiquity of the deposits enveloping it. Theoretically the dates ofremains occupying the same geological horizon at the same site should have beenmuch closer than those actually determined.Reviewing examples of anomalous botanical C 14 dates like those just noted, DrGeorge Carter once observed that terrestrial plants differ in their carbonintake according to their individual ecological situation. Forest plants, forinstance, differ from those in open countryside in their amount of isotopecarbon. He also wondered if different parts of a plant differ in the amount ofCarbon-14 that they naturally absorb 20 . The evidence of the various plantremains just listed suggests that this might very well be the case and that itcould also have been so in the distant past as well.Pollen sequences are often regarded as providing an unambiguous climatic recordover the last 15,000 years or so. There are, however, definite limitations tothe accuracy of its actual dating 21 . Between 1,500 and 20,000 years theaccuracy of its dating is usually held to be ±250 years 22 , although this maybe an optimistic assessment. For example, pollen found in an area of West AngleBay Ireland, indicated cool conditions, whereas pollen taken from the samedeposit in a nearby area indicated fully temperate conditions 23 .Other anomalous results involving dated pollen samples are known. One instance,abog sample procured from below remains of a Romano-British archaeological siteof known date gave a C 14 date one thousand years too old 24 . This result wasprobably generated by the presence of an unknown quantity of 'dead' Carbon-12 (C14 ) in the sample tested, which is liable to dilute the equilibrated mixture ofC 14 and C 14 25 . Variations in such mixtures within individual samples could,as at West Angle Bay, produce contradictory results. It is still a matter ofdebate whether the Irish deposit was formed under cool or fully temperateconditions, an uncertainty inevitably having a bearing upon the precisecharacter of the former environmental background of that region. Radiocarbondates can not only spring surprises but sometimes multiply uncertainties.Again, aquatic plants and land, freshwater and marine shells are prone toproviding misleading radiocarbon dates due to the fact that they mayincorporate, through the watery media in which they live, deficient (old) C 14as all or part of their original carbon content, thus giving dates which are tooold 26 . The distribution of radiocarbon in the oceans lies in the mixing zonesbetween the upper and deeper water layers, which exhibit great differences incarbon dioxide content. This category of material can even be contaminated inlaboratories from foreign carbon in the atmosphere and water supply 27 , sothat, due to these and possibly yet other variables, \"...with samples older than15,000 BP, errors in dating and correlations are so large that errors inapparent ages of some hundreds of years are of minor importance\" 28 . At leastone case is known where the error amounted to no less than 12,000 years!Worse still, shells taken from the same vertical section of an infinitely morerecent burial mound in south-eastern USA produced dates which \"came out in thereverse order of age -\\The shells of molluscs also sometimes yield wildly incompatible dates.Separately C 14 -dated fractions of the outer shell of a so-called 'latePleistocene' pelecypod from Furry Creek, British Columbia, for example, turnedout to be 11,080 ±160 years old, whereas fractions of the inner shell of thesame specimengave a C 14 date of 11,300 ±190 years BP 30 , a difference of approximately 300years - for the same specimen!Significant differences unquestionably exist between the isotopic composition ofplants and animals, and C 14 dating of their remains generally reflects this(see Appendix B), even when applied to contemporary biota.Thus, blood and fat from the celebrated frozen mammoth cadaver found atBeresovka in Siberia afforded a C 14 date of about 39,000 years BP 31 , whereaspollen and plant fragments taken from its stomach (logically, the remains of itslast meal) gave an unexpectedly young date somewhere between 7,000 and 6,000years ago 32 . It is probable that both these seriously-conflicting dates areerroneous, and that the mammoth and the remnants of its last meal are of thesame general antiquity as the frozen mammoth carcass from the Taimyr Peninsulain Arctic Russia, whose sinews have been C 14 dated at 11,450 ±250 years BP 33 .Unlike ancient plant debris, fossil and sub-fossil bones are composed primarilyof calcium mineral and C 14 , little of the latter if they represent oldindividuals and more of it if they belong to younger animals. By testingcollagen - the protein found in bones - it is possible to obtain C 14 dates.This, however, becomes difficult when the collagen decreases with age to lowconcentrations. Moreover, it has been established that the environment of aburial can materially affect the apparent 'age' of the specimen being examined34 . This, then, is yet another variable.It is obvious from the foregoing that, despite their apparent accuracy,radiocarbon dates are actually anything but precise (although still a greatadvance on nearly all previous methods of dating ancient material) and that eachexample should be evaluated relative to the various factors and constraints justhighlighted. For these reasons, therefore, the formulation of even a generaldate for the tremendous disaster under consideration is possible only by takinga large number of published dates from the relevant literature, and distillingthe mean average of these. This is attempted in Appendix B, which lists over200 samples from 574 separate C 14 dates lying between 13,000 and 10,000 yearsBRBotanical dates have been segregated from their zoological equivalents, and NewWorld from Old World examples. The resultant averages of each of these groupingsis given separately, and the final mean of these submitted as the likely generaldate - 11,577 BP -of this great event. However, allowing for, say, a cumulativeerror of around 50 years either way, it is perhaps safest to settle on 11,500BP.as the best 'approximate' date yet available to us. Future research willdoubtless refine this considerably.A quite different avenue of enquiry concerns Plato's date for the cataclysmicfoundering of the legendary island of Atlantis, said to have occurred 9,000years before his own day 35 . Adding these 9,000 years to the 400 separatingPlato's time from the time of Christ, and both of those to the 2,000 which haveelapsed since then, we obtain another 'general' date of 11,400 years. This isremarkably close to that derived from averaging the C 14 dates just discussed.Plato, of course, spoke in comparatively vague terms, and Atlantis, if it everexisted, almost certainly did not sink precisely 9,000 years before Plato wrote.Significantly, augmentation by only a few score years brings Plato's dateextraordinarily close to that suggested by C 14 dating methods for the onset ofsome terrible worldwide catastrophe. Can this be wholly coincidental?Focusing now on the likely time of the year when this disaster took place,palaeontologi-cal evidence seemingly provides the most reliable clues as to theactual month or months when it occurred. Plant remains in the stomachs of therefrigerated Siberian mammoth carcasses, and the amazingly well-preserve flowersand fruits discovered almost undisturbed on dead trees and bushes in Arcticlands (see Wood Hills of the North in Part Five) show that early summer was theseason when this event erupted.Just as telling are the vast numbers of very young animals which, with theirelders, were chaotically entombed within the 'drift' deposits in caves,rock-fissures and depressions in open country. We immediately recallthe numerous afore-cited reports specifically mentioning the indiscriminateslaughter of young and old alike, including foetuses. The presence at that timeof so many juvenile animals indicates that the annual spring births, so generalamong mammals and birds, had only lately been achieved.Other clues are contained in various traditional recollections of this event.Ovid, for example, refers to ripe grain being consumed by immense heat directedat Earth by a rampant celestial agent h« referred to as Phaeton. Other accountsmention fruit being shrivelled by a tremendous world-enveloping heat. Ripe grainand well-formed fruit, and the acorns and nuts recorded from many 'drift'deposits in high latitudes all indicate late summer or early autumn season. Latesummer or early autumn in, say, the northern hemisphere (where many singularlypreserved fruits and nuts have been discovered) would give late Spring as itsequivalent in the southern hemisphere (where many examples of juvenile animalshave been met with, although not exclusively so. The probability that Earth,prior to this terrible event, revolved daily in a tholiform or more uprightmanner would, of course, have lessened the difference between the seasonshemispherically, or resulted in 'breeding' and 'harvest' seasons overlappingmore extensively than at present. If so, that would account for the widespreadcontemporaneous burial of so many now seasonally separated strands of biologicalevidence in the same globally-distributed 'drift' and analogous deposits.*Yet another line of approach concerns the ancient Persian tradition that adevastating conflict between Earth and a rampaging celestial object calledTistrya (Ovid's Phaeton) occurred when the latter was in the zodiacalconstellation Cancer 3 ''. According to these records Tir was the name of thefourth month of the year, and as Cancer is the fourth constellation from Aries(when the ancient Persian year began, the celestial conflict took place in thefourth month. By modern reckoning this would make April the month when thisevent occurred, as in April the Sun is in the constellation of Cancer. However,inthe ancient Persian scheme, Tir and the zodiacal sign of Cancer actuallyextended from 21st June to 21st July 37 . A high summer date, adequatelyencompassing recent 'breeding' and 'harvest' seasons north and south of theequator, thus appears to have been the date when this disaster (not just theDeluge) first unfolded. It is, therefore, seemingly easierto fix the time of year than to identify the actual year when this calamityoccurred.We are, then, about to follow a trail at least 11,500 years old, which, thoughdead and cold in many places, is elsewhere still plainly discernible andprovides valuable insights into what really must have happened all thosecenturies ago.2An Unknown Assailantf-^szt&iiiajzz-iThe traditions briefly reviewed in Part Three, which describe a majorcatastrophe having struck and devastated this planet long ago, in the childhoodof humanity, expressly and consistently state that the calamity was due to aconfrontation between Earth and one or more errant celestial bodies of immensepower. In short, external agencies are unmistakably invoked.Several authorities who have closely studied the geophysical features which,temporally at least, appear to naturally fall within the time span of thatdreadful event, have independently concluded that these can only have resultedfrom influences exerted uniformly on the globe as a whole. Such conclusions alsonecessitate one or more external agencies. We have, in fact, already seen thatthis very suggestion has been raised with regard to the aforementioned worldfracture complex, and the extensive mountain-building activity whichcharacterised much of 'late Pleistocene' times. It was postulated in the early1910s by Prof Rudolf Hauthal and Prof Hans Meyer after studying 'ice age'phenomena in Andean Peru and Bolivia with regard to an even wider range ofgeological factors. They stated that:Taken in conjunction with the accumulating evidence that the Ice Period occurredsimultaneously over the whole globe, thefacts lead to the conclusion that the cause is to be sought outside the globe -that is, it was of a cosmic nature. No cause having a local effect on specialregions of the globe can account for all the phenomena. 38We previously advanced a similar genesis for the coeval biological extinctionsdetailed in Part Two. There, we saw that animals (often conventionally butmistakenly regarded as Ice Age forms) and plants of 'late Pleistocene' age were,regardless of size, age, sex or natural adaption, suddenly and violentlyslaughtered indiscriminately on all continents, Antarctica excepted. That factoralone confirms the global nature of the disaster involved and that the resultantextinctions occurred far beyond the boundaries set for Ice Age regimes byorthodox glacialism. The recorded despair of even dispassionate biologistscontemplating the sobering scale of these frightful extinctions has already beennoted, surely itself a matter of much significance.The very immensity and obvious violence of operation exhibited by all thesechanges unerringly indicates that forces of staggering power brought them aboutwith alarming speed globally.The numerous traditions descriptive of a vanished genial prehistoric world - theGolden Age of the classicists - terminated abruptly by world-embracingdisturbances, are remarkably accurate accounts of the very conditions requiredby the relevant fossil and geological evidence generally. This can hardly beanother coincidence. Something, or some particular set of circumstances, quiteliterally brought to a sudden and violent end a long-established,environmentally equable regime worldwide. Viewed collectively, the knownevidence admits of no other model. Lyellian ,'uniformitarian' cycles were notinvolved, but catastrophic processes were. Indeed, only very exceptionalcircumstances could have produced them.The question, then, is what actually caused such profound, widespread and swiftchanges if, apparently, the Earth is itself incapable of generating them on sucha grand scale unaided? Precisely what external influences could have beenbrought to bear on our planet and simultaneously engendered so many strikingresults?Traditionally, the principal celestial agent responsible for this disaster wasremembered internationally by a plethora of names. Several of these have alreadybeen mentioned, although Phaeton®, Typhon 40 and the Midgard Serpent? areprobably the best known. The agencies represented by these names were ancientlymythologised and were regarded as deities or terrible monsters to be revered,feared and placated. Almostalways they were recollected as having been fiery, wayward and the bringers ofpestilence and death. Surviving accounts of their visual appearances and theiractivities in the heavens - one interesting account which we shall consider morefully later details the main object's journey among the planets before reachingEarth's vicinity - present problems for modern scholars desirous of accuratelyidentifying it. Was it, for instance, a comet, an asteroid, a giant meteorite orwhat?That question occupies many pages soon to follow: but before grappling with itscomplexities we must first consider more closely what kind of agent or agencieswould be needed to wreak so much havoc on Earth and cause our planet to react asit did. And we also need to take a more detailed look at the structure andmotions of the Earth itself in order to appreciate how these would have torespond to acute external influences. These, in turn, should enable us to gaugethe general level of severity needed to effect the structural and biologicaldisruptions of the magnitude highlighted in parts one and two. Several recentdiscoveries have cast considerable light on these factors.At this juncture, however, we are faced with a highly destructive agency ofcosmic origin which, though traditionally remembered by a great variety ofnames, is as yet of undetermined identity. As an 'assailant' it is indeed'unknown'.Earth Structures-^iSjt^iaj^r*The average person takes the Earth on which they live, its natural motions andthe regular passing of successive days and nights more or less for granted.Blissful ignorance of the interplay of the complex processes which regulateEarth's seemingly orderlybehaviour, and of its precise location in space, is not uncommon, while amongothers such factors are but very dimly understood. Here, however, such luxuriescannot be afforded if we are to accurately trace the outline of the tremendousevent we willhenceforth refer to as the Phaeton Disaster. At the very least we need a basicoverview of Earth's general structure, motions and planetary status toaccomplish our goal. A simple summary of these, designed to put into perspectivethe many details which follow, is given below.The Earth is one of the minor members of the family of planets comprising thesolar system (see fig 4.1) - enjoying, insofar as planetary scales areconcerned, a modest status only. It is, however, a very well-developed 'water'planet (Venus is another), as against 'waterless' planets like Mercury and Mars,or gaseous planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.Orbiting the Sun at a mean distance of 93,000,000 miles (148,800,000km), onceevery 365 days (one Earth year) of 24 hours apiece, the Earth pursues an orbitwhich is not circular but an immense ellipse. The Earth is nearer the Sun atsome months of the year than others, approaching closest to the Sun in lateDecember each year, and its furthest distance in late June each year.Earth's configuration resembles that of a flattened globe, where the equatorialdiameter exceeds the polar by 26.70 miles (42.72km). The Earth has an axisaround which it rotates once in every 24 hours. This axis, however, is not'upright' (ie, at right-angles to the plane of the Earth's orbit) butinclined at an angle of 23.5° from the vertical - thereby explaining why thenumber of daylight hours in any given day varies in different parts of theEarth. Combined with the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, this axial tiltaccounts for the four seasons -spring, summer, autumn and winter - which, ofcourse, are reversed north and south of the equator. Thus, as the Earth movesalong its orbit inclined at an angle of 23.5°, and because the orbit iselliptical, summers in the northern hemisphere occur when the Earth is furthestfrom the Sun and those in the southern hemisphere when it is nearest the sun.It is important to grasp the above details because, as seen earlier, both thefossil evidence and various traditional accounts suggest a more verticallyaligned axis prior to Phaeton's visit. If true, a vertical axis would haveproduced days of equal length all the year round, and the seasons (assuming theywere distinguishable) would not have been so marked as at present.Particularly critical is the fact that if the Earth were a true sphere it wouldhave no stability of its axis of rotation, and:...the smallest beetle walking over it would be able to change the axis ofrotation relative to markings on the sphere by an arbitrarily large angle; theaxis of rotation inPlutopicture37 [images/picture37.jpg]Fig 4.1. Schematic diagram of the solar system. The orbits of the planets areshown on the same plane - most planets orbit approximately so, except for Chironand Pluto.

The attitude of the Earth to the Sun. Viewed as from above. Not toscale.space would change by a small angle only. What stability the Earth's axispossesses against movement relative to the solid Earth is derived from thegeoidal shape... This complete stability against a secular change is thereforedependent upon the stability of the shape... 42 .The geoidal shape, of course, is the equatorial bulge, which, stabilising theEarth as it rotates, prevents it turning over pole to pole. This equatorialbulge also allows the application of torques by the Sun and Moon, which causethe Earth to wobble like a top and pro-duce thereby a slow precession of the equinoxes 43 . We shall meet this lattereffect again shortly in connection with the density of the Earth. \"...At presentthe solid part of the Earth is very nearly the equilibrium shape appropriate tothe present speed of rotation\" 44 .If, however, some external body could exert a sufficient influence upon theEarth - for example to induce a fast torque, thereby altering its angle ofrotation by a significant amount, changing the axial tilt -then the newly formedequatorial bulge would force Earth's crust to adjust itself toNorthern SummerNorthern Winterpicture39 [images/picture39.jpg]Southern Winter About 21st June *picture40 [images/picture40.jpg]Southern Summer About 22nd DecFig 4.3. The tilt of the polar axis.that bulge. This raises the question of whether there is a permanent stiffnessor an absence of stiffness in the main geoidal shape. Certainly any severedeparture either way from its present shape would betray itself very simply by adisplacement of the oceans, for:...the oceans which take up the equilibrium shape instantly would then dominateeither at the poles or in equatorial regions. In fact, the distribution of landand water shows no significant tendency of such a type. On the other hand, theEarth's speed of rotation is believed to have changed significantly ingeological time. It has been changed either by giving up angular momentum to theMoon through the agency of tidal friction - and the Moon shows signs of a tidalbulge appropriate to a greater proximity to Earth - or the speed of rotation maybe determined by the resonance with atmospheric tides, in which case it musthave changed substantially with changes in the structure of the atmosphere. 45Here, then, we find that, although the Earth's present configuration is close tothe equilibrium shape appropriate to the planet's rotational speed any seriousdeparture from that shape would generate all kinds of catastrophic physicaleffects. Similar dire results would occur if the speed of rotation were greatlyslowed or accelerated by some means. It has been noticed that the present axisof rotation is decidedly unstable, and not apparently of any great geologicalage. Gold's observation that changes in the structure of the atmosphere may havealtered the speed of rotation is particularly interesting for, as we shallpresently see, such an atmospheric change did indeed occur as part of thePhaeton disaster. That the Moon also exhibits signs of having previously beencloser to Earth is another noteworthy point, for, if nothing else, it suggests adefinite though not fatal former disruption of the present Earth/Moon system.The significance of this possibility will shortly become all too apparent. Wemust nowresume, however, our survey of the Earth's structure.Earth's mass or weight is estimated to be about 6.6 x 10 21 tonnes (66 followedby 20 zeros), and its density to be a value of about 5.519 46 . Such figuresimmediately raise problems of crucial import, for typical rocks, such asgranite, underlying the dry land surface of the Earth, possess a density of only2.7. As Putnam once commented:Where is this additional heavy material to be found to give such a high averagevalue for the whole Earth? Does the density of the Earth increase at a constantrate from the surface to the centre? Or does the Earth have lighter material inits surface layers and then have extremely heavy material concentrated in somekind of central core? 47 .This last possibility is generally considered to be the most likely, althoughsome have urged that a uniformly increasing density from the surface down to thecentre rather than a concentration of denser materials near the centre is moreprobable. Certainly other lines of evidence suggest that the specific gravitynear the Earth's centre may be 15 and possibly as high as 18 4 *.Compared to any single object on its surface, then, the Earth is enormouslyheavy and gives most observers a reassuring impression of vast strength andpermanence. Viewed from a planetary standpoint, however, this is somewhatillusory, for the Earth's crust is comparatively very thin, varying in thicknessfrom a mere 5-30 miles (8-48km) 49 , with the thickest portions believedlyunderlying the mountain ranges. Proportional to the Earth as a whole, the crustis therefore scarcely any thicker than an onionskin is to an onion.The crust itself consists of three main layers. An uppermost one of loose orunconsolidated deposits, such as gravel or ooze, in many places comprises theactual crustal surface. Below this is a layer of moderately hard consolidatedrocks, such as limestone and sandstone, which are often stratified andfossiliferous; and lowest of all is a layerextending downwards to the lowermost portions of the crust, composed of veryhard crystalline rocks, such as granite and serpentine, of igneous (volcanic)origin, and devoid of fossils.Most of the depressions caused by the inequalities of the Earth's surface areoccupied by water, so that only a mere 29.22% of land actually appears above sealevel. This unequal division of land and sea leads to some very interestingstatistics concerning the distribution of water on Earth. Thus:These figures show that the oceans constitute close to 95% of the total amountof water on the Earth and existing snowfields and glaciers only about 1% 50 .Despite their relatively great overall volume and the tremendous pressure theyexert upon the crust, compared to the size of the Earth the oceans are littlemore than puddles occupying hollows on its surface, and immeasurably smallerthan the oceans of semi-fluid molten magma that underlie the crust. Indeed, theestimated total amount of magma within the Earth exceeds the oceans in volume1000:1 and in mass 5000:1 51 . The genesis of magmatic fluids, however, remainsunknown, nor is it known at what depth in the planet's interior they originate52 . It was once believed that the whole interior below the crust was molten,and that volcanoes, being points of crustal weakness, were surface outlets forthis fiery incandescent material which, on exposure to air, cooled as lava. Thisis now known to be untrue.The data available to us indicate that the depth of the source for mostvolcanoes is shallow. Furthermore, the magmatic source for a volcano is verylocalised,compared to the total area of the Earth...\"A shallow origin for the source of the magma appears to be exactly that requiredby those Earth models which postulate that the 'mantle' - the material, solid orotherwise, underlying the crust but above the Earth's core - is multi-layeredand visco-elastic 54 . In such models it is believed that these layers move atslightly different speeds from one another as the Earth rotates once every 24hours, the resultant friction between them being a source of heat and magma. Weshall discover the great significance of these possibilities when, shortly, weidentify the external influence which so cata-strophically brought 'Pleistocene'times to an end.Nevertheless, quite prodigious quantities of magma can be ejected even by amoderate volcanic eruption. Thus, in 1887 Mauna Loa in Hawaii produced roughly5,000,000 cubic yards (about 2,500,000 tonnes) of lava per hour 5 ''; andconsidering the lava erupted continuously for approximately 150 hours, some ideaof the immense volume of magma which reached Earth's surface on that occasion iseasily formed. Moreover, the lava was of a very heavy basaltic type, and wasapparently lifted a minimum height of 20,000ft (6,250m) to the surface from itssource within the Earth.Deep fissures in the lithosphere (Earth's crust and mantle) also sometimespermit magma to reach the Earth's surface. In several regions, as in the Deccanof western India, the Columbia Plateau of the north-western United States andthe Parana River region of South America, vast floods of basaltic lavas,predating Phaeton's visit, have welled up through fissures, and overspread hugeareas as accumulations often hundreds of feet thick. These magmatic outpouringssignificantly altered local topographies.Forces exerted on the magma include, along with the natural gravitational onesof the Sun and the Moon, the Earth's speed of rotation (a centrifugal force)which creates the equatorial bulge mentioned previously. These pressures exertgreat thrust, since the viscous or semi-fluid magma, unlike the ocean waters, istotally enclosed. Evidence suggests that the magma directly under the crustrotates at a similar speed to the crust, but that all the magma in specificvertical areas will, depending on densities, pressures and temperatures, possessan angular momentum - 0 at the poles to l,000mph (l,600kph) at the equator. Thespeed of rotation probably varies also at different depths within the Earth'sinterior. These magmatic movements may conveniently be referred to as the magmatide.Any sudden or marked realignment of the Earth's axis or in Earth's speed ofrotation would induce changes in the magma tide as it adjusted to the newequator or altered rotational speed. Such changes, however, might not be uniformthroughout, owing to a 'drag' factor deep in the magma itself, although overallthey would certainly impose terrible strains on the lithospheregenerally. That widespread magmatic adjustments occurred at the time ofPhaeton's visit must be obvious from the evidence presented earlier. The actualoperation and the effects generated on that occasion will be discussed shortly.Still deeper within the Earth is the core. This believedly consists of an innerand an outer core. Nobody, of course, has ever seen Earth's core, but thegeneral consensus of opinion is that it is a solid or near-solid mass with ahigh metallic content. There is, however, a sizable body of opinion whichprefers to regard it as a largely liquid core of immense density. The core'sactual diameter is also as yet undetermined, and may indeed be undeterminable ifit is not spherical, but it is thought to be many hundreds of miles, and perhapsto be very much greater. As a unit, the core is extremely important and isintimately connected with the Earth's magnetic field, to which we must now giveattention.Geomagnetism*-^—%Ls-;-ifeS«r-»The Earth possesses an electrically-charged magnetic field, referred to simplyas geomagnetism. Earth is not alone in possessing such a field, as essentiallysimilar ones exist on the Moon 56 and on Mercury 57 , to name just two otherbodies in the solar system. Not improbably such fields are commonplacethroughout the Cosmos generally.Laboratory experiments have shown that a rotating spherical magnet takes with ita magnetic induction field which, in turn, gives rise to an inducedelectromagnetic force (EMF) in a connecting circuit. Interestingly, the EMFformed by the Earth's field tends to slow down the planet's rotation, a factorof much significance.The Earth being a rotating, approximately spherical, electrically-conductingmagnetic body, is thus a kind of gigantic equivalent of the rotating magnet inthe laboratory mentioned above. The Earth's magnetic poles, which, when united,form a di-pole (two oppositely-charged separated poles), are slightly off-centre(ie, they do not coincide with the geographical poles). They are alignedapproximately along the axis of rotation but in the opposite direction to thatof the angular velocity vector (see fig 4.4). As early as 1803, it wasdemonstrated conclusively that the Earth is negatively charged 5 \", a findingamply confirmed by many further experiments. From these discoveries and theEarth's present electrical condition, the magnetic di-pole is known to besimilarly charged 59 .Being electrically-charged, the Earth will attract to it and acceleratepositively-charged particles in the solar wind flow\"'. This positive charge evenmanifests itself in the atmosphere and causes a downward electric field ofbetween 100 and 500 volts per metre at ground level on a clear day 61 .R E Juergens has noted that, as space is now known not to consist of anear-vacuum as previously thought, but is a plasma of dissociated ions andelectrons, electrically-charged bodies such as planets could, in certaincircumstances, perturb each other, and that, in order to shield themselves,possess a space-charge sheath capable of assembling a sufficient charge to matchthe electrical potential of the surrounding plasma. Juergens suggested that thischarge is actually the magnetosphere (fig 4.4), and that a body which has eitherorbited the Sun far out in the solar system or which has traversed interstellarspace may have thus acquired an exceedingly high electrical potential. Hefurther suggested that such a body, if or when passing on an intersecting orbitwith a planet in the solar system would probably not collide, due to thecushioning effect of the space-charge sheaths of the bodies involved. Howeverelectrical discharges could be expected to occur between them as the bodiesendeavoured to equalise their electrical potential. The discharges could assumeenormous proportions andproduce catastrophic effects on both bodies 62 .Earth's electromagnetic field, therefore, apparently performs a function ofgreat importance, inasmuch as, in the event of the near approach of somehighly-charged celestial body, it acts as a shield to minimise the cataclysmicresults that would otherwise occur. Any breach of the field would, of course, bedisastrous.All authorities agree that the Earth's elec-tromagnetism is generated in theEarth's core, and emanates from the movements of the molten fluid (assuming thatthis is what the core consists of). This motion is created by the effects of theEarth's precession on the solid crust and on the core itself. Indeed: \"Therelevance of precession to the geomagnetic field is that the rate is determinedby the magnitude of the equatorial bulge\" 61 ."},{"pageContent":"It is therefore widely believed that electric currents are a major component ofthe geomagnetic field, with the dynamo being driven by the combinedgravitational influence of the Sun and Moon - the cause of precession in thefirst place. Thus, any serious distortion (up or down) of this Solar/Lunargravitational pull would disrupt the precession to such an extent that Earth'smagnetic field would drop (weaken) due to a reduction in the electric currentbeing produced - even to the extent of causing the dynamo to go into reverse fora short period. This would amount to a magnetic reversal! As we shall now see,good evidence exists for such a reversal having occurred at the time of thePhaeton disaster.Solar windpicture41 [images/picture41.jpg]'J-..■-■■Fig 4.4. The space charge-sheath and magnetosphere of the Earth. After P Dualand C IV ParkinReversed PolarityWhile in liquid condition igneous rocks are non-magnetic, but when cooling toabout 580° Celsius, or Curie Point, acquire and retain a magnetic state, theorientation of which reflects the magnetic polarity of the Earth at the time thecooling takes place. This is often referred to as polaeoniagnetism. Themagnetised rocks may later become displaced, or the orientation of the Earth'smagnetic field altered. The widespread occurrence of solid rocks possessing areversed polarisation has long interested geo-physicists, who have spent manydecades investigating the causes and significance of this apparent anomaly.Certainly there is now universal agreement that the only plausible explanationfor the phenomenon is: \"...that the Earth's magnetic field was itself reversedat the period when the rocks were formed\" 64 . Researches have also shown that:\"The north and south geomagnetic poles reversed places several times'\"' 5 . Andthe process is envisaged to have been abrupt: \"...the field would suddenly breakup and reform with opposite polarity'\"*. Moreover, as the source of terrestrialmagnetism is believed to lie in electric currents on the surface of the Earth'score:...substantial changes in the speed of Earth's rotation become easier toexplain... Whatever the mechanism, there seems no doubt that the Earth's fieldis tied up in some way with the rotation of the planet. And this leads to aremarkable finding about the Earth's rotation itself... the Earth's axis ofrotation has also changed. In other words, the planet has rolled about, changingthe location of its geographical poles. 67 (Our italics).Reversed polarity in rocks, therefore, is apparently connected with catastrophicconditionslike those previously described in this book, and very definitely with some typeof axial shift. But the intensity of such polarity greatly exceeds the norm andstrongly suggests the involvement of non-terrestrial influences -although undernormal circumstances the intensity of magnetism acquired by cooling rocksdepends on the speed with which the original molten material cools and on thesize, composition and form of its constituent particles. Thus, although somevariability in the intensity of the magnetism acquired by igneous rocks undernormal conditions is predictable, rocks exhibiting reversed polarity possessmagnetic charges ten times and often up to one hundred times stronger than couldhave been produced by known terrestrial conditions. As Manley has observed:This is one of the most astonishing problems of palaeomagnetism, and is not yetfully explained, although the facts are well attested\" 68 .Despite the demonstrated occurrence of an unexpectedly large number of magneticreversals throughout Earth history, it cannot be mere coincidence that aparticularly well marked reversal took place around the general date (11,500years BP) advocated in this book for the Phaeton disaster. Reversedly magnetisedsediment near Gothenburg in southern Sweden, for example, has been dated asbeing between 12,600 and 8,600 years old 61 *. The mean average of these datesfalls surprisingly close to 11,500 years BP, and within the so-called Laschampgeomagnetic event (17,000 to 7,000 years ago) 70 , which latter also suggeststhat the inclination of the Earth's magnetic axis at that time may have been 30°from its present orientation. Such possibilities have prompted various authori-ties to enquire whether, at times of polarity reversals, the magnetic polefollows the polar axis, or vice versa, and Cox and Doell to remark that,although unlikely:It is, of course, possible that the coincidence of thepalaeomagnetically-deter-mined di-pole axis and the present rotational axis isfortuitous. 71The geological youthfulness of these polarity reversals not only findscorrelations with the comparable modernity of many of Earth's presenttopographical features, as specified in Part One, but is also strongly suggestedby the clusters of palaeomagnetic anomalies discovered in north and centralEurope, eastern Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and New Zealand, centred around thedate 12,500 BP 72 . These are widely regarded as representing a global magneticreversal about that date, which has come to be named the 'Gothenburg flip'.Significantly, a drop in the strength of the Earth's entire magnetic fieldappears to have occurred sometime between 13,750 and 12,350 years ago 73 . Thiswas attended by various other important changes, including earthquakes,vulcanism, water table fluctuations and large scale climatic variations. Ofthese, severe earthquakes in particular may even induce axial wobble, andpolarity reversals. Discussing such possibilities, Kennett and Watkins notedthat:Heirtzler has recently speculated on a relationship between earthquake activity(and by implication upper mantle activity) and geomagnetic polarity change. Hereasons that because there is evidence to show that earthquakes of magnitude 7.5or greater may cause wobble of the spin axis, it is therefore conceivable thatan Earth wobble may be of a magnitude sufficient to cause reversal of thegeomagnetic field 74 .Inevitably such axial wobbles and crustal strains generate both seismic andvolcanic activity. It is not surprising, therefore, that a relationship has beentraced between periods of severe vulcanism and geomagnetic changes, and thatthese have, in turn, greatlyinfluenced climatic regimes and caused widespread biological extinctions.Indeed, as Kennett and Watkins have observed:Of eight observed micro-faunal extinctions and appearances in the SouthernOcean, six either occurred during or very close to geomagnetic polarity changes.We suggest that the climatic changes which can result from volcanic maxima aremuch more plausibly the cause of such extinctions and appearances than increasedradiation at the water surface during any di-pole collapse accompanying apolarity change... 75 .It will be recalled from Part Two that the annihilation of the Siberian andAlaskan mammoths and their contemporaries, approximately 11,500 years ago, wasaccompanied by massive vulcanism and that similar coeval evidence has been notedfrom California, South America and several other localities. Innumerable otherregional changes of varying intensity and longevity occurred coincidentally indifferent parts of the world, and combine to produce an overall picture of epicturmoil. And since vulcanism and earthquakes frequently go hand-in-hand, of whatmagnitude were the earthquakes and eruptions which accompanied the latest upliftof the Rockies, Alps, Himalayas and many other prominent mountain ranges? Asseen in Part One, these attained their present elevations at the very close ofso-called 'Pleistocene' times. Consider R T Chamber-lin's description of therise of the Andes in South America:Hundreds, if not thousands, of cubic miles of the body of the Earth almostinstantaneously heaved upward produced a violent earthquake which spread...throughout the entire globe. Many world-shaking earthquakes must have beenby-products of the rise of the Sierras. 7 \" (Our italics).Another celebrated authority, Eduard Suess, wrote in much the same vein when hesaid:The earthquakes of the present day are certainly but faint reminiscences ofthosetelluric movements to which the structure of almost every mountain range bearswitness. Numerous examples of great mountain chains suggest by theirstructure... episodal disturbances of such indescribable and overpoweringviolence, that the imagination refuses to follow the understanding. 77 .Here, surely, were earthquakes and eruptions that far transcended those which,according to Heirtzler, would be needed to cause wobble of the spin axis - awobble which, in Kennett and Watkins' opinion, would conceivably have been largeenough to have reversed Earth's magnetic field.Thomas G Barnes has examined another aspect of reversed polarity. He noted thatall available data show an exponential decay in the Earth's magnetic field, witha half-life of only 1,400 years. This led him to conclude that:It is obvious that this magnetic decay phenomenon could not have been going onfor more than a few thousand years, as the magnetic field would have beenimplausibly large for the Earth. This is strong physical evidence that theremust have been a relatively recent origin of this electromagnet or some unknowncatastrophic (our italics) 're-energising' event. 78 .This re-energising event was presumably that which imparted magnetic charges toigneous rocks ten to one hundred times stronger than normal. In our submissionthis was the Phaeton visitation which, as we have seen, was catastrophic. Wemust mention, however, that some authorities have suggested that the process ofpolarity reversals actually occupies a very considerable period of time, thereversal itself perhaps as long as 1,000-3,000 years, the decay from 2,000-3,000years, and the recovery of the magnetic field a further 2,000-3,000 years.Such views reflect a 'uniformitarian' approach requiring the Earth's magneticfield to be self-reversing under specific conditions - and that it does thiswithout outside influence. It has, for example, been pointed out that the Sun'smagnetic field reverses itselfduring each 11-year solar cycle 7 \". No evidence exists, however, for any suchregular reversal of Earth's magnetic field. Nevertheless, as indicated above, itis entirely possible that abrupt reversals could conceivably occur undercatastrophic conditions. The extremely highly-charged igneous rocks mentionedearlier are apparently examples of such reversals. Certainly, one or morehighly-magnetised errant celestial bodies of great density, or large mass,making a close approach to the Earth, could produce exactly the above describedeffects.Like many of his imitators, the leading modern 'catastrophist', ImmanuelVelikov-sky, has urged that the near-approach to Earth of some such largecelestial body (in his opinion a comet which became the planet Venus) would havecaused the Earth to cease rotating 80 . Velikovsky's conclusions were largelybased upon the Old Testament story of Joshua which, with equivalent legends fromother sources, asserted that in early historical times the Earth actuallystopped rotating. Viewed scientifically, the braking to a halt of the Earth inspace is theoretically possible, but only if a sufficiently massive externalinfluence is involved. The internationally famous astronomer, Dr Carl Sagan oncedevoted considerable time analysing Velikovsky's arguments 81 . Althoughconcluding that Velikovsky's concepts were very probably erroneous, Sagan foundthat a cessation of Earth's rotation was certainly feasible given the rightcombination of circumstances. He especially discussed the thermal energyproduced by any slowing of the Earth's natural rotation, observing:...thermal considerations are in fact fatal to the Joshua story. With a typicalspecific heat capacity of cp~8xl0 6 erg gm\" 1 deg\" 1 , the stopping andrestarting of the Earth in one day would have imparted an average temperatureincrement of... 100°K, enough to raise the temperature above the normal boilingpoint of water. It would have been even worse near the surface and at lowlatitudes... 240°K. It is doubtful that the inhabitants would have failed tonotice sodramatic a climatic change. The deceleration might be tolerable, if gradualenough, but not the heat. 82 .Elsewhere, Sagan states that a gradual deceleration of the Earth's rotationcould take place over a period shorter than a full day* 3 , and that the minimumtime for an external influence to make itself felt upon the Earth as a whole isjust 85 minutes 84 . Sagan, who concluded that no cometary influence like thatenvisaged by Velikovsky could have slowedor halted the Earth's rotation, was, of course, considering comets as thedisruptive agents since this was Velikovsky's thesis. If, however, comets werenot the culprit bodies, but some other body or group of bodies acting inconcert, then Sagan's conclusion, while correct relative to Velikovsky'sarguments, may very well be inapplicable to the great world disaster highlightedthroughout this book. As we shall see shortly, Phaeton was almost certainly nota comet but some other type of celestial object.The Thermal Factor«T^%i ! *.a*»*sr»Geomagnetic changes involve vast quantities of thermal energy already possessedby the Earth. Much of this is caused by internal tidal friction - magmatic flowversus the semi-rigid outer crust, resulting from the planet's natural rotation.The outcome of this is to convert rotational and/or orbital energy to thermalenergy. Any alteration to Earth's present modus operandi would, if it involved arotational or orbital change arising from tidal friction, lead to a loss oforbital energy accompanied by either a loss of, or no change to, angularrotational momentum. Dr Harold Urey, investigating this matter relative to thehypothetical near-approach to the Earth of a large comet, concluded that theloss of thermal energy amounted to 10 31 ergs 85 . Others have suggested stillhigher figures and, again, have usually postulated the close approach of atleast one sizable celestial object as being necessary to cause such a loss.Influenced by the ideas of writers like Whiston, Donnelly, Beaumont andVelikovsky, this object has usually been thought of as a large comet, although,as shown later, its identity was almost certainly not cometary. At least oneleading authority on celestialmechanics, J Derral Mulholland, has examined the validity of Velikovsky's ideasand of possible collisions between Earth and other planet-sized celestialbodies. Although not specifying the size of his hypothetical planet, it may besafely presumed that Mulholland had in mind one the size of Venus or Mars, sincethese two planets featured so prominently in Velikovsky's writings. Accordingly,Mulholland wrote:If a planet-sized object were to pass close to the Earth, then giant tides wouldbe raised; there would be global earthquakes; the north pole would changedirection; the day, the month, the seasons, the year would all change. Faith isnot involved here; these are unavoidable consequences of the laws of motion aswe presently know them. We must accept that the dynamical aspects ofVelikovsky's visions of hell on Earth are largely acceptable. This is not toadmit that the events he described ever happened... today the celestialmechanics of Sir Isaac Newton and Simon Newcomb are no longer the ultimatemeasure. Today, celestial mechanics is a living, vital science thatadmits of non-gravitational effects, of electromagnetic interactions, offlexible astral bodies and of statistical descriptions of some types ofoccurrences involving large numbers of bodies. In spite of our new knowledge,some unrecognised influences may yet remain. 86 .Obviously, any near-approach to the Earth of a massive celestial objectpossessing high electromagnetic potential would, through slowing or haltingEarth's rotation and generating internal tidal friction, greatly increase thenatural level of Earth's thermal energy.In such circumstances, therefore, frightful earthquakes (as Mulholland admits)leading to axial wobble (as Kennett and Watkins postulate), an abruptgeomagnetic reversal and a change in the location of the geographical poles (asRuncorn, Kennett and Watkins, Mulholland and others have concluded), as well asdramatic climatic changes and a general rise in temperatures - especially nearthe surface and at low latitudes (as Sagan admits) - could be expected to occurconcurrently on a global scale.It can hardly be coincidence, therefore, that all these derangements appear tohave occurred more or less simultaneously on Earth - geologically very recently.Nor can it be coincidence that these same physical changes are rememberedgraphically in a host of legends, traditions and ancient texts the world over.Even Sagan's deduction that world temperatures would have risen above theboiling point of water finds confirmation in various traditional accounts, aparticularly telling point when it is realised that this was a transientphenomenon incapable of leaving in the geological record much in the way ofpermanent evidence for its actual occurrence. Summarising many original sources,293,2 \" 4 Bellamy has noted:The reports of a flood of 'hot' water are rather numerous. Various NorthAmerican tribes, such as the Makah, Quileute and Chimakum Indians, mention intheir myths the surprising temperature of the waters which, as they correctlyreport, were surging towards the north. 87Elsewhere, Bellamy provides further examples of these singular ancientrecollections: the Voguls of Finland believed that a great Deluge of boilingwater once roared over the world; the Salinas Indians of California describe aflood of hot water which anciently overwhelmed the entire globe; the Ipurinas ofnorthwestern Brazil tell how the Earth was once drowned by a tremendous flood ofhot water because the Sun tipped over; and Talmudic records report how theantediluvians perished in boiling water at the time of Noah's Flood 88 .It is difficult to see how numerous isolated peoples, sharing a common memory ofa vast global inundation long ago, could have independently invented the idea ofits waters being hot. Their accounts, scattered and variable though they are,must refer to the former real existence of such waters and to the realoccurrence of the physical conditions necessary for their production.The normal friction between Earth's semirigid outer crust and its viscousmagmatic interior, as well as the thermal energy naturally generated by it,would have been greatly intensified during any event like a Phaeton disaster.Viscosity of magma is profoundly affected by stress or removal of stress, whilethe magma's centrifugal speed as Earth rotates, and the drag that would beimposed upon Earth by any closely-approaching celestial gravitational influence,are other factors governing the behaviour of hot plastic-like magma undercataclysmic conditions 89 . Under stressful conditions, such as Phaeton's visitengendered, the magma tides must have reacted very much along the linespostulated by Donald Patten when he wrote:Based on spherical volumes, with the diameter of the Earth about 8,000 miles, itcan be seen that the oceans of magma are infinitely greater than the relativelythin and shallow pools of water lying on top of the Earth's crust.Hence the tidal upheaval from within the Earth must have been very much greaterthan the tidal upheaval on the Earth's surface, involving her relatively minuteoceans. Therefore upheaval or thrust internally and compression externally musthave beensimultaneous; only their proportions were different. With this volume of magmain tidal upheaval, the Earth's crust acted something like a bellows. And theEarth's relatively shallow oceans merely washed around as the Earth's crustheaved and sagged 90 .Continuing his theme with reference to the conclusions of geologists like DrGeorge Gamow\" and Dr Adrian Scheidegger 92 , Patten added:Any fluid, when constricted, will exhibit a greater thrust... The fluid ocean isuncon-fined; the fluid magma is completely confined. This affects the gatheringor concentration of thrust in certain belts or regions. Also the nature of wateris somewhat different than magma as a fluid. At high temperatures, magma becomesincreasingly fluid, and at lower temperatures, it becomes increasinglyviscous... At the high temperatures inside the Earth, magma has a nature whichis neither exactly like a fluid, nor exactly like a solid. It is described as'plasticlike'. It is something like asphalt, beeswax, honey or molasses. It willflow, but at retarded rates 93 .Clearly the hotter magma becomes the more easily and quickly it will flow andthe more responsive it would be to any approaching external gravitationalinfluence. Under such conditions, the thermal energy resulting from the enhancedfriction between it and the confining terrestrial crust would be truly enormous,leading in time to the magma becoming a very mobile mass within the Earth'sshell. It is thus not unduly difficult to see how, or why, in the Arctic, thedepth of the Eurasian Basin is anomalous, and:...represents a regional collapse of the Earth's surface due to material beingremoved from the lower mantle. 94Or why there was an apparently coeval collapse of a huge tract of the oldlandmass of Beringia (see map 1C) immediately east of the present Kamchatkapeninsula, or why there were partially compensatory massiveup-wellings of magmatic lava then elsewhere.It is especially noteworthy, therefore, to find references in the Phaeton cycleof legends to the rocks boiling and melting at the time of that disaster. Manyinstances, particularly from mountainous districts, of rocks recently folded,bent and warped while clearly still in a molten state were highlighted in PartOne. There, also, consideration was given to the almost unimaginable heatgenerated by colossal rock masses sliding juggernaut-like over one another whenthe Alps, Rockies and Himalayas, in attaining their present elevation, weremoved long distances laterally in various geographical directions. With so muchthermal energy unleashed by these and other related causes, it is little wonderthat so many nations possess recollections of a terrible world conflagration andof boiling flood waters at the time of the Phaeton disaster.The association of a worldwide conflagration and a global deluge, however, hasproved especially vexatious for classicists because this reported juxtapositionseemingly makes little or no sense. These scholars perceive no underlyingcalamity capable of producing both types of destruction on a planetary scalemore or less simultaneously. The otherwise excellent mythologist G Knaack, forexample, found himself supposing that the linking of the two agents was due toan invention of some later compiler, thus:Mention of the rivers that Zeus unleashed gave the later reviser the idea of thedeluge. 95Such interpretations ignore the fact that: numerous independent accountsrepeatedly insist that a terrible world conflagration was extinguished by animmense deluge which also destroyed that untouched by the fire; and that theassociation of the two motifs is embedded in traditions far older than theclassical Greek and Roman Phaeton accounts. Englehardt recognised this when heremarked:The very fact that several sources report on a link between Phaeton'sdestruction andpicture42 [images/picture42.jpg]the Deucalion flood, or more generally, between catastrophes of fire and water,in spite of the difficulty in rational explanation, favours the fact that it isnot a matter of later constructions but that here, via mythological hypotheses,a part of stubborn reality comes to light from under a veil. Therefore we shallhave to conclude from the sources that the fiery catastrophe that wasinterpreted as Phaeton's fall was really followed by a short-lived but extensiveinundation which ended the lives of so many men that one could talk of adestruction of mankind. 1 *Today, our possession of knowledge unknown to the earlier classicists andmythog-raphers permits a better understanding of how the Earth would react physicallyif subjected to a catastrophe like the Phaeton disaster and its attendantstresses.Is it not, therefore, exceedingly remarkable that many of the physical effectsmentioned in the catastrophe legends exactly reflect the physical conditionsdeducible from detailed analyses of the interplay of the relevant natural forcesactivated by a hypothetical near-collision between Earth and a sizable celestialobject; or that the field evidence for the former real occurrence of such anevent and its effects is both abundant and incontrovertible? The coincidencesare surely too numerous to be products of mere chance.Instability«^s*******sr»The reality of a geologically recent alteration to the inclination of Earth'saxis of rotation which, as indicated in parts one and two, can be repeatedlyinferred from abundant geophysical and biological evidence associated with theend of the so-called Ice Age, is a matter of prime importance to a properunderstanding of what happened to our planet about 11,500 years ago.As noted earlier, an axial change may have occurred coincidentally with the lastgreat polarity reversal known to us, the 'Gothenburg Flip', and that earthquakesof 7.5 or more on the Richter scale of severity -such as those recorded in PartOne as having attended the gigantic crustal disturbances, extensive mountainbuilding and intercontinental rifting characteristic of 'late Pleistocene' times- are sufficient under particular circumstances to generate axial instability g7. As concurrently-operating phen-omena, these 'late Pleistocene' dislocations could not have arisen of their ownvolition, but can only have been initiated by some external cause.Thus, the genesis of several singular axial and orbital fluctuations exhibitedby Earth even today can be traced back directly to the tremendous events of11,500 years or so ago. A brief survey of some of these provides a clearerpicture of how and why Earth presently functions as it does.Contrary to popular belief, neither Earth's elliptical orbit round the Sun\" 8nor its daily speed of axial rotation'\" is absolutely fixed. Both have varied,sometimes quite appreciably, over a period of time and may yet do so again.Many authorities have linked these orbital and rotational fluctuations to theonset\"\" as well as the melting 101 of the alleged 'Pleistocene' ice-sheets, withclimatic changes 102 , migrating monsoonal regimes 103 , and withincreases in solar radiation reaching the Earth's upper atmosphere 104 . Statedbluntly, the Earth's orbit (although not depicted as such in diagrams of thesolar system) 'wanders' somewhat erratically along its course, and the Earthitself spins irregularly and 'wobbles' as it moves round the Sun. Suchinstabilities are symptomatic of a flawed equilibrium. Their connections with somany aspects of present and recent world climates illustrates their crucial rolein initiating and maintaining those regimes.By human standards fluctuations in the earth's daily speed of rotation appear toreflect a longterm disorder exhibiting an approximate 10-year cycle of operation105 , and is seemingly the result of a combination of imperfectly balancedfeatures deep within the Earth itself 106 , including core-mantle coupling 107 -of which more shortly. In reality, however, the origin of these fluctuationsappears to be remarkably youthful.The rotational irregularities in particular are intimately linked with the'Chandler Wobble', caused by the fact that Earth's axis of rotation fails tocoincide with its axis of inertia. Of these, the former describes around thelatter a cone-like motion - a small rapid wobble 108 - known as nutation, whichit performs over a more or less set period. The period has been termed theChandler or Newcombe Period and the resulting unbalanced motion the 'ChandlerWobble'. The relationships between these motions have been investigated byseveral astronomers and geophysicists in recent years 104 , while others haveexplored not only additional excitations of the wobble by various climaticfactors, such as atmospheric changes 110 , but, subscribing to Earth modelsrequiring a multi-layered visco-elastic core, that viscosity of the deep mantle111 and core region 112 can also enhance wobble and its speed of action. Yetothers have studied the apparent connections between large earthquakes andexcitations of the Chandler Wobble 111 , complementary to Heirtzler'scalculations respecting the degree of seismic intensity needed to induce,theoretically at least, polarity reversals and a change in the location ofEarth's geographical poles or spin axis.Significantly, one of the most marked orbital changes yet traced, and certainlythe one so far most studied, occurred at the end of the 'Pleistocene' epochbetween 11,000 and 11,500 years ago. It was virtually coincident with theinauguration of the climatic and atmospheric changes just listed, and with theadvent of the environmentally-disturbed Younger Dryas episode referred toearlier. This, it will be recalled, was epitomised by singular and abruptalterations to oceanic circulation, wind intensities, northern snowfall levelsand to large segments of the plant and animal kingdoms. These all were changes,it was also suggested, conceivably generated by some sort of adjustment to thetilt of the Earth's spin axis.Orbital and rotational changes, of course, could be expected if the tilt ofEarth's spin were altered - although that could probably only occur as aresponse to some powerful influence outside Earth itself.Be that as it may, all these changes are unquestionably interrelated, whiletheir direct association with the end of the alleged Ice Age times and the onsetof the highly variable Younger Dryas episode indicates that many if not all theeffects developed more or less synchronously about 11,500 years ago, througharising from a common cause.In the general scale of geological events they occurred but yesterday.It is thus scarcely surprising that Earth is far from being the most perfectlyfunctioning planet that a surprisingly large number of people assume it to be.On the evidence of its fluctuating motions and behaviour patterns, it has notmerely recently sustained serious disruption to many of its natural physical andatmospheric features but is still slowly recovering from the traumatic eventwhich imparted them.In that connection it must also be significant that analogous planetaryinstabilities of apparently recent date, and which will be considered in greaterdetail shortly, are traceable elsewhere in the solar system. Before dealing withthat evidence, however, we should contemplate the far-reaching implications ofthe further aspects of pole-shift set out below.Pole Shifts^szj&itj&zr*Among the terrestrial effects listed by ./Yalmost every investigator of atheoretical near-collision has been a shift in the inclination of Earth's axis.Authorities of the calibre of Runcorn and Mulholland have admitted that axialshifts could be expected to occur on such occasions. This subject, however, wasdebated far earlier, although usually in connection with a specific event - agreat world catastrophe during the infancy of mankind. The ancient EgyptianIpuwer Papyrus, for example, describes terrible devastation created by an earlycataclysm which \"turned the Earth upside down\" 114 . The Ermitage Papyrus, nowpreserved in St Petersburg, refers to a similar ancient world convulsion 115 ;while a third Egyptian papyrus tells how the Earth was nearly destroyed by fireand water during a tremendous celestial upheaval long ago when the south becamenorth and the world turned over 116 . The celebrated Greek philosopher Platodescribed a similar axial dislocation, caused by a vast flood \"which foamed inand streamed out\" and made the Earth move irrationally:...forwards and backwards, and again to right and left, and upwards anddownwards, wandering every way in all six directions. 117Not only does Plato's remarkable statement remind us of Runcorn's conclusionthat Earth 'rolled about' on the occasion of a massive magnetic reversal, but itsuggests that the Earth wobbled wildly in many directions. It also reminds us ofthe Greenland Eskimo belief that Earth formerly turned over, and that theAndaman Islanders fear a repetition of a great natural disaster that occurred inthe days of their remote ancestors when the world capsized\" 8 . Also it issignificant that,on viewing a comet in the heavens, the peasantry of Menin in Flanders used toexclaim: \"The sky is going to fall; the Earth is turning over\" 119 .*We are also reminded here of the aforementioned ancient Chinese and other earlytraditions describing a time when the stars poured across the heavens and Earthsettled down to a lower position than it had previously occupied. All theseapparently refer to an axial change witnessed by early Man.Modern interest in such momentous events revived last century. The then-recentSpitzbergen discoveries, for example, suggested to some that those islands musthave once lain 20° nearer the equator than they do today 120 - and as the moderntheories of continental drift and plate tectonics had not then been formulated,it was considered that a change in the position of the poles (an axial tilt),causing profound climatic alterations, must have occurred. This explanation wasusually that offered to account for the obvious very rapid refrigeration of thehairy mammoth and woolly rhinoceros cadavers found in northern Siberia.Geologists were asked by mathematicians and astronomers what geologicalconditions would be necessary to cause such polar shifting. The most likelycause, the geologists opined, was a redisposition of the weight of the Earth'ssurface. This possibility was closely analysed by Sir George Airy, thenastronomer royal, who assumed a sudden elevation of a mountainous mass inlatitudes \"most favourable for production of a large effect\", that would preventthe axis of rotation from coinciding with the axis of the globe geoid. This, heargued, would cause the Earth to wobble and the poles to wander. The small-nessof the inferred effect was, however, discouraging and Airy concluded that:* See Note 12.191...the shift of the Earth's pole would be only two or three miles, and this,though it would greatly surprise astronomers... would produce no such changes ofclimate as those which it desired to explain. 121A reinvestigation of the problem by Sir George Darwin using the same formula washardly more encouraging: only a relatively small amount of polar shift waspossible, a mere two degrees in fact. But serious objections to the validity ofthis approach were voiced, even in the 1870s. One mathematician emphasised aparticularly important point -one still crucial to any modern assessment of theproblem. He advised:Mathematicians may seem to geologists almost churlish in their unwillingness toadmit a change in the Earth's axis. Geologists scarcely know how much isinvolved in what they ask. They do not seem to realise the vastness of theEarth's size, or the enormous quantity of her motion. When a mass of matter isin rotation about an axis, it cannot be made to rotate about a new one except byexternal force. Internal changes cannot alter the axis, only the distribution ofthe matter and motion about it. If the mass began to revolve about a new axis,every particle would begin to move in a different direction. 122 (Our italics)The geologists' specifications had proved too imprecise, and Airy, Darwin andothers had assumed a 'uniformitarian' solution apparently incapable of actuallyoccurring.A much better explanation of climatic changes attendant upon markedly reorientedgeographical poles, was advanced by the Austrian meteorologist Julius Harm, whowas quoted by W B Wright as follows:The simplest and most obvious explanation of great secular changes in climate,and of former prevalence of higher temperatures in northern circumpolar regions,would be found in the assumption that the Earth's axis of rotation has notalways had the same position, but that it may have changed its position as aresult of geologi-cal processes, such as extended rearrangement of land and water. 121As seen in Parts One and Two, a radically different disposition of land andwater evidently existed until Phaeton's visit. Large continental landmasses suchas Fennoscandia, Appalachia, Beringia, Tyrrhenia and others in the southernhemisphere existed in regions presently occupied by oceans now often miles deep.Their combined weight was stupendous and its redistribution through crustalcollapse catastrophic.We have also seen that many of these changes occurred around 11,500 years ago atthe onset of the Younger Dryas episode, when, among other effects, large-scalenorthern ice-sheets are said to have abruptly melted and snowfalls suddenlyintensified. Seemingly contradictory (and certainly at odds with our contentionthat the ice age of conventional geological doctrine never actually existed),these effects are actually explicable if the surface erosion (and deposition ofextensive 'drift' deposits) usually but mistakenly attributed to massiveglaciation were really legacies of the naturally violent action of immensevolumes of water displaced by enormous sudden rearrangements of Earth's crustdue to extensive subsidence of land-masses like those just mentioned.It can be no coincidence that several recent studies of precisely these factorshave linked, on the one hand, continental lithospheric thickness 124 , and, onthe other, widespread deglaciation of supposed northern ice-sheets 125 to theprobability of 'polar wandering' during alleged Tee Age' times. Replacing finiteice-sheets (and subsequent deglaciation) with finite regions of lithosphericthickness (and the subsequent collapse or subsidence of these), would appear toengender the same general effects if subjected to some external force disruptingthe inner workings of Earth as a planet. Not only has all this a further bearingon the chimerical nature of the celebrated 'Ice Age', but it is related toviscosity of the Earth's mantle and core and the likely behaviour under stressof both these aspects of Earth's structure. As we shall now see, the Earth'scrust could actually slide or slip to a catastrophic degree.Crustal Slippagerv>ay-s*a*sr»It may be erroneous to argue that a relocation of Earth's spin axis wouldnecessitate the pulling over of the entire globe into a new orientation. In1952, K A Pauly revived a theory previously developed by the astronomer A EEddington, purporting to explain the cause of the 'Ice Age' as due to thesliding of the lithosphere over the viscous magma underlying it through tidalfriction originating from the Moon 126 . This is tantamount to saying thatcrustal slippage had occurred.We have noted that the hotter magma becomes the more viscous and asphalt-like isits condition. Oceans of highly heated magma would provide an excellent fluidsurface over which comparatively solid crustal rocks could theoretically slide.Obviously a lesser force is needed to produce crustal slippage than to tilt thewhole globe in some new direction, for the crust is only a portion - and acomparatively small one at that - of the Earth's total mass, and the momentumrequired to achieve this is directly dependent upon that mass.To ensure that the axis of the Earth's core is that of the planet generally,while simultaneously permitting the crust to slide over the magma, the frictionbetween these two layers (the source of much thermal energy) must be obviated -and in order to alter the position of the crust relative to Earth's spin axis,the regions comprising the equatorial bulge must be stretched while polarterritories must be at least partially truncated or compressed. Significantly,both phenomena occurred at the close of 'Pleistocene' times.In the concept of a rotating multi-layered visco-elastic planet like thatreferred to earlier, the arguments that the irregular coupling of Earth'sdifferentially-revolving viscous core and mantle, even now producingvariations in the length of day, begins to look like an after effect ofgeologically recent crustal slippage. Normal mantle viscosity enhanced bypowerful external influence, combined with sudden 'deglaciation' 127 , thusseemingly caused not only extensive crustal slippage and fracturing, vulcanism,seismic activity and orogeny, but also a change in the actual inclination of theEarth's spin axis. Acting in concert, such phenomena would have been sufficientto produce all the geophysical changes enumerated up to this point.Nevertheless, although Eddington's theory unquestionably contains severalattractive features, such as accounting for warmer areas formerly existing atthe poles and vice versa in other latitudes, it has certain serious drawbacks.Thus, as early as the 1920s, another authority, Harold Jeffreys, highlighted aflaw in Eddington's theory. He wrote:Has the inclination of the Earth's axis to the plane of its orbit varied duringits history? The answer... is a definite 'Yes!' The theory of tidal friction...assumes the equator and the plane of the Earth's and Moon's orbits tocoincide... they do not. 128This difference between the plane of the Earth's and the Moon's orbits stronglysuggests, however, that it is the terrestrial axis that has altered. We have,moreover, previously noted that the Moon was apparently once closer to Earth, soit is conceivable that, even if displaced, the Moon may have still retained theoriginal plane of its orbit.Did these apparent changes result from the same cause? We may never know theanswer to this question although, while it is theoretically possible tointerpret these displace-merits as due to two entirely separate events, perhaps aeons apart, it surelyoverstretches credulity to argue that any influence powerful enough to havealtered the inclination of Earth's axis would have somehow contrived to excludesuch a near celestial neighbour as the Moon from its sphere of action.Jeffreys was another authority who concluded that only an external force couldinduce a change in the orientation of the terrestrial axis. He remarked:If we consider the axis of the Earth's angular momentum, this can change indirection only through couples acting on the Earth from outside. 12 \"Almost all authorities are as one, therefore, in concluding that only a powerfulexternal agent could have altered the inclination of Earth's axis. We haveoutlined the principal hypotheses advanced from time to time purporting toexplain how this could or might have happened dynamically. Broadly speaking,these advocate that either the entire globe was realigned axially, or that onlythe Earth's crust changed position by sliding over the underlying viscous magma.Since, however, Earth's axis has obviously changed, and geologically veryrecently at that, the first group of explanations concern the very heart of theproblem, and indicate that the entire Earth has indeed assumed a new axialinclination. This does not exclude crustal sliding as having occurredsimultaneously with axial displacement.The aforementioned crustal deformations, especially the crustal foreshorteningaround the present polar regions, as well as the extensive rifting andfracturing - as Hobbs 130 and others have concluded - occurred on a planetaryscale everywhere at about the same time. As others have contended, the Earth'saxis must have been inclined in a more vertical plane than today 131 . Thesecrustal deformations collectively constitute excellent evidence that crustalsliding occurred in at least some regions concurrently with an axialrealignment.In this respect the precession of the equinoxes and the Chandler Wobble - acircle that the polar axis describes about itself every432 to 436 days 132 - may represent not only further results of a recentperturbation of Earth by some massive external influence but also 'hunting' bythe Earth as a unit in its endeavours to regain complete stability.It seems, therefore, more than likely that both the above categories ofexplanation are essentially correct, that they are not mutually exclusive, andthat both planetary and crustal changes of the magnitude discussed took placesimultaneously.Finally, is it not interesting to find accredited authorities suggesting thatglobal fracture patterns, such as would occur at the time of crustal slippageand axial realignment, indicate that, immediately prior to the time offracturing, the inclination of the terrestrial axis was more vertical than atpresent?If so, it is surely important to consider the following points very carefully.The present plane of the equator to the orbital plane (the obliquity of theecliptic) is currently 23°27'8\", and has been calculated to vary between 21° and24° over a period of 40,000 years 133 . This governs the seasons as they nowoccur, and provides the one day/one night per year presently experienced at thepoles. If the obliquity were nil, however (ie, if the plane of the equator andthe orbital plane coincided), and the rotational axis were vertical, thefollowing effects would dominate:• Day and night would be of equal length everywhere on Earth.• Environmental conditions would differ profoundly from those of today, with awidening of the temperate zones and a marked narrowing of the cold and torridzones.• Milder polar conditions would prevail and the present ice caps would notexist, or would exist only very feebly, at the poles.• The differences in the seasons would diminish with fewer extremes of climateeverywhere, with some regions never experiencing a proper winter.These factors, and the aforementioned fact that virtually all the world's majormountain ranges were appreciably lower before the 'Pleistocene' Phaetonvisitation, enable us toreadily appreciate how such conditions can only have been conducive to vigorousplant growth on almost every land area; that deserts can only have been small ornon-existent; and that ocean currents must inevitably have been generallywarmer. The further possibility that, before this terrible event, Earth may haverotated more slowly - with a day lasting perhaps as much as 30 hours - alsomeans that there would have been longer growing-time for plants, both daily andseasonally; and that any disruptive external influence, of the magnitudenecessary to enforce a shift in the orientation of the geo-graphical poles, would have braked the Earth to a halt more rapidly than seemspossible with its present rotational speed. The corollary to this would be thatthe resultant crustal dislocations and worldwide increase in thermal energywould have occurred somewhat more quickly, and certainly at a catastrophic pace.All the details, therefore, begin to come together. Facts which at first sightappear anomalous, and ideas that initially seem fanciful or unlikely, nowinterlock like pieces of a giant jigsaw. Dare we ignore the significance of sucha pattern?10 The Solar Systeme^s*±*-ii*? i =r\"»Accepting for a moment the reality of a ±\\. near-collision between Earth and oneor more sizable astronomical objects approximately 11,500 years ago, it followsthat such an event could scarcely have been confined to just the Earth/Moonsystem, or failed at some stage to involve at least some of the other planetsand bodies comprising the Sun's family. Indeed, even a general survey of thatfamily discloses some very remarkable details which collectively suggest that,in the comparatively recent past, several of those bodies were subjected to andpartially deranged by some powerful influence of unknown origin and identity.As detailed description of the constituent members of the solar system wouldmake rather tedious reading here, the salient statistics are better comprehendedin comparative tabular form.The huge astronomical distances cited are utterly meaningless, of course, to allsave mathematicians, and fail to convey either the immensity of space occupiedby the solar sys-tem or the isolated position of this system in the immeasurably grander vastnessof the Cosmos. It is, however, important to grasp the enormity of this backdrop,for it was against this that the Phaeton disaster occurred; and since, as willshortly be shown, Phaeton traversed the solar system before reaching theenvirons of Earth and took an appreciable while to cross the distances involved,early humans possibly had sufficient time to perceive that a major catastrophewas approaching and make organised preparations to save themselves from theimpending destruction. It must, therefore, be extremely significant that ancientrecords have come down to us actually describing the awesome cosmic dramaproduced by Phaeton during its passage through the solar system. These will beconsidered shortly.If, therefore, we make a scale model of the solar system small enough to bereadily understood, it will have to be the size of Piccadilly Circus in London(some 150yds or metres across), and we must use a marble-picture43 [images/picture43.jpg]Left: Fig 4.6. The eccentricities of the orbits of the inner planets, drawn toscale.Right: Fig 4.7. The eccentricities of the orbits of the outer planets, drawn toscale. This diagram is eighteen times smaller in scale than fig 4.6. The orbitof Chiron is not shown, since, due to its recent discovery (1976), little is yetknown about its eccentricity.sized object to represent the Sun. This we will place in the centre of themodel. On the same scale, the planets will be small seeds, grains of sand, andspecks of dust, and the model will be only just large enough to accommodatePluto's orbit. On this scale virtually all the satellites become invisible. Yet,as Sir James Jeans once observed 134 , at this scale the nearest star,represented by another marble, will be somewhere near Birmingham or, if we go inthe opposite direction, somewhere near Calais - some 100 miles or 160km distant.We can see, therefore, that although the Phaeton disaster was a gigantic affairhere on Earth, in the context of the solar system it was a much more modestevent, while in that of the Universe generally it amounted to little more than aripple.Before reviewing the evidences of apparently recent celestial disruption in thesolar system, it will be important to note that, contrary to popular belief, theplanets do not orbit the Sun on a common plane or follow exactly concentricpaths. Indeed, table 4A shows that Neptune and Pluto, for instance, orbit onextremely different planes, and (figs4.6 and 4.7) the eccentricities of the planetary orbits generally.Also of relevance is the path taken annually by the Sun through the twelvezodiacal constellations as viewed from Earth. Traditionally these constellationsare those of Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius,Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. They form \"...a band about 8°wide on the celestial sphere, centred on the ecliptic\" 135 or plane of theEarth's orbit around the Sun, in which the Sun, Moon and planets appear fromEarth to move from west to east 136 (not to be confused with the daily apparentrotation of the heavens as a whole from east to west - the former being due tothe orbital motion of Earth and planets, and the latter being due to therotation of the Earth). Strictly speaking, \"...the ecliptic is a mathematicalfiction corresponding not to the actual plane of Earth's orbit, but to one withall minor irregularities smoothed out\" 137 .Although the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos is generally credited withhaving discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic 138 ,Table 4A.Planetary statistics Based on the latest available informationMetric values, where appropriate, given in parentheses.the Greeks did not, as is often stated 139 , devise the zodiac about 2,000 yearsago, although they probably were responsible for allotting each sign a width onthe celestial sphere of 30°. References to zodiacal constellations in theearlier records of the Babylonians, Egyptians, Chaldeans and ancient India 14 \"show that, as a device, the zodiac was much older than classical Greek culture,being of very great antiquity indeed.But irrespective of when the zodiac was first devised something noteworthyhappened to it subsequently.Because of the effects of precession and as a result of the InternationalAstronomical Union's (IAU) adoption of constellation boundaries which are notexactly 30° long, the Sun's passage through the constellations does notcorrespond to its passage through the signs of the zodiac. According to the IAUboundary definitions, the Sun travels 44° through Virgo, only 7° throughScorpius [both zodiacal signs], and 18° through Ophiuchus, a constellation forwhich there is no zodiacal sign. 141This suggests that a change has occurred in the inclination of Earth'sterrestrial axis - like that previously discussed - since the zodiac was firstinvented. In that connection it is also interesting that certain ancienttraditions aver that Libra was a sign added to the zodiac following the Deluge.*If true, that would imply an antediluvian origin for the zodiac. The traditionalassociation of the Deluge event with Phaeton's visit gains added interest whenwe recall that ancient Persian accounts specify that the visit occurred when theSun was in the zodiacal constellation of Cancer, a detail indicative of theexistence even then of some type of zodiacal device or gauge.Thus, from a quite unexpected quarter we encounter further apparent confirmationof the recency of a profound terrestrial disruption which, occurring afterpeople had reached a fair degree of civilised existence, among other thingsaltered an early device created, presumably, to measure time and predictseasonal cycles. That people attained such advanced knowledge so early isstrongly supported by their coeval possession of the astonishing mathematicalexpertise highlighted in later pages.♦ See Note 23.Any celestial intruder arriving from more remote cosmic regions would tend toencounter or pass close only to planets nearest its line of advance at thatspecific time. Those planets which happened to be orbitingthe far side of the Sun might, in such circumstances, remain comparativelyunaffected by the intruder. This, we shall find, appears to be precisely whatoccurred during the Phaeton event.11 The Mavericksr^aa&itt&zr*In addition to the planets and their satellites, there are other celestialbodies and substances in the solar system, which pursue erratic paths or areunpredictable in their actions. Accordingly, they may be conveniently dubbedcelestial mavericks. Some of their recorded characteristics suggest that theymay have had direct connections with the Phaeton disaster.AsteroidsThe genesis of asteroids is uncertain, and has long been a subject forspeculation 142 . The asteroid belt lies between the Jovian and Martian orbitsand, because some attain appreciable size, are sometimes referred to asplanetoids. Irregularly shaped, apparently rocky, bodies, asteroids range insize from Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Iris and Juno - the largest, with estimateddiameters up to 625 miles (1000km) - to others perhaps just metres across.Calculations suggest that up to 80,000 asteroids may actually exist 143 ,although most are too small to detect by present means.Approximately three thousand asteroids have now been discovered and awardednames or numbers; others have been briefly sighted only to be 'lost' again. Noasteroid is big enough to retain an atmosphere, although it has been postulatedthat a few of the largest may possess frozen ones represented by a coating ofice.One of the largest, the irregularly-shaped Vesta, which has an average diameterof 325miles (520km), is of particular interest here on several counts. Close-upphotographs of it taken by a recent NASA space probe shows that Vesta has anastronomically and geologically very youthful basaltic surface, and two evenyounger large craters believed to have resulted from a \"single great impact\" 144- although with what is as yet undetermined.Although the origin of many asteroids is still unknown, opinions have latelybeen offered that at least some asteroids may represent all that remains (ielower mantles and core) of \"catastrophically ruptured\" formerly larger bodies145 . The significance of that interpretation will become apparent later.Many similar asteroids appear to be free-moving pieces of some of the largerasteroids. Vesta, for instance, appears to have spawned a small family of lesserasteroids and another family of small basaltic meteorites, called eucrites^.Analyses of several eucrites which have fallen to Earth show that not only isthe basalt of which they are made apparently the same as that forming Vesta'ssurface, but that it is likewise exceedingly youthful 147 . It has beensuggested that these eucrites represent fragments of Vesta's surface blasted outradially into interplanetary space by whatever impacted with it and endowed itwith two craters.Numbers of other asteroids circle the Sun on highly eccentric orbits, severaloccasional-ly approaching closer than Mars - and at least eight cross Earth's orbit. Of thelatter, Eros, with a diameter of a mere 16 miles (25km) has been known toapproach to within 14,000,000 miles (22,400,000km) of Earth. Viewedastronomically this is rather close.Collectively, the behaviour patterns of these objects are highly suggestive ofsome geologically recent disruption of an older, more orderly asteroid regime,or that the asteroids en masse (eucrites included) are themselves remnants ofone or more cata-strophically disintegrated bygone worlds.CometsOver a thousand comets have been reported since modern records were first begun,and on average six or seven new ones are discovered every year. It has beensuggested that their number is in the order of 100,000, but even this hugefigure may fall short of the real total.Although various hypotheses have been formulated, comet origins are unknown 148.Some authorities suggest the existence of cometary material far beyond the solarsystem, which is periodically disrupted causing pieces to be drawn off; others,like Clube and Napier 149 , suggest they originated through the destruction ofone gigantic object some 10,000-20,000 years ago; and Opik has wondered aboutcomets and planets having a common origin 150 . Van Flandern has even discussedthe possibility of comets being remnants of a former asteroid planet 151 . But,whatever their source, they are apparently true members of the solar system,revolving round the Sun on elongated, elliptical orbits 152 .The period of these orbits varies considerably, with 40 or so comets circlingthe Sun with orbital periods of 100-1,000 years, while the majority takeconsiderably longer. Some, it has been estimated, take as long as 40,000 years153 .There are also short-period comets and those which return at erratic intervals.For instance, Encke's comet orbits the Sun every 3.3 years, but has been knownto arriveMoonpicture44 [images/picture44.jpg]Fig 4.8. Schematic diagram showing a typical path of a comet round the Sun. Notehow the comet's tail always pointsaway from the Sun.'early' on several occasions 154 ; while Biela's comet, orbiting every 6.6years, arrived late three times before finally disintegrating in 1852 155 .About 20 comets have been seen to divide since Biela's break-up. A photograph ofMorehouse's comet of 1902 shows what seems to be the comet's tail fragmenting(fig 4.9).Additionally there are occasional interstellar comets which do not orbit theSun. One such was Bronsen's comet of 1846, which arrived from remote cosmicregions, crossed the solar system, and travelled on into interstellar space,never to return 15 \".While the Sun acts as a focus for all cometary orbits, Jupiter appears to act asanother focus for short-period comets. Lexell's comet of 1770 and Brook's cometof 1889 both actually passed through the Jovian satellite system and almostgrazed the surface of Jupiter and split in two 157 . Yet, despite such closeencounters, no comet is known to have seriously affected the motions of the Sun,the planets, or their satellites. Indeed, it is the planets which affect thecomets, not the reverse, with the larger planets such as Jupiter and Saturncapable of altering the comet's orbit and speed 158 .This is due to the fact that comets have insufficient mass to perturb theplanetary bodies in the solar system gravitationally 159 . Even though the comaor 'head' surrounding the nucleus of a comet may attain a diameter of about20,000 miles (32,000km) or even 200,000 miles (320,000km) - thus exceeding theSun in volume but not in mass - it is actually very thin and seemingly composedlargely of dust, for all but the dimmest stars can be seen through it 160 .The actual mass of a comet lies in its nucleus, the latter varying in itsdiameter from less than a mile (1.6km) in small comets to as much as 10 or 20miles (16-32km) in large ones. The composition of the nucleus is still notclear, but it is thought by some to be aggregates of stones loosely heldtogether by gravity - the equivalent of a flying gravel-bank. It has also beenreferred to as a 'dirty snowball' on the assumption that it is composed of'interstel-lar dust' made up of compounds of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, methane,ammonia and water - the last three as ice particles 161 . Another opinionpostulates that frozen water is the main constituent 162 . It is also widelythought that ices compose 70-80% of all cometary nuclei 163 . It is thisinsubstantial mass of the comet's nucleus which makes it an unlikely candidateto be Phaeton, for while a collision would cause some planetary damage, almostcertainly such limited mass would fail to perturb Earth's motion, fracture itscrust, retard its rotation, engender a magnetic reversal or affect the polaraxis.MeteorsLiterally billions of these rocky objects seem to be loose in interplanetaryspace. Many theories have been formulated to account for their existence. Anearly idea regarded meteors as the remnants of orbiting trains left by bothexisting and defunct comets, mainly because of the occurrence on particulardates of meteor swarms. Some meteors, however, are so large - up to a mile(1.6km) or so in diameter - that it seems unlikely that they were ever parts ofcomets. More recently, different explanations have been advanced. One is thatmeteors normally orbit in the asteroid belt but that hypothetical collisionsbetween asteroids from time to time disrupt meteor orbits and move them into newones across the solar system. Meteor orbits, however, are unknown, and accordingto some may differ appreciably from those of asteroids. Another theorypostulates that meteors are fragments of parent meteoric planets which passthrough the solar system 164 , although nobody has so far knowingly sighted sucha planet. Trains of meteors have been observed, however, which possibly supportthis theory - an especially memorable one occurring on February 9th, 1913,travelling NW-SE at a speed of 6 mps (9.6 kps), some 30 miles (48km) above theground over a large area of North America 165 .A third theory postulates that meteors are slowly drawn in on spiral orbitstowards the Sun from various regions of the solar system, due to thePoynting-Robertson effect 166 . Thiseffect is relatively weak, however, and hardly strong enough to affect thelargest meteors, which are actually quite massive bodies. The origin of meteors,therefore, is currently uncertain, and a satisfactory explanation of theirexistence well overdue.The advent of satellite space photography has revealed numerous previouslyunsuspected land-forms suggestive of impact by very large meteors on variousoccasions throughout Earth history'\" 7 . These features, which have constitutedthe central theme of at least two full-length books 168 , clearly show that onimpacting these meteors perpetrated widespread damage, and that while some aregeologically ancient others are surprisingly recent.Although fallen meteors (meteorites) vary in composition, 96% of all knownspecimens contain Chondrites (silicate and other minerals) which are absent fromterrestrial rocks but are present in the atmosphere around the Sun; and theyalso contain iron 169 . Meteorites composed of iron or a high percentage ofnickel are known as Siderites to distinguish them from non-metalliferousmeteorites which are called Aerolithes. Some Siderites are of great size. 295One, which fell near Elbogen in Bohemia, in 1400 AD, weighed 2351bs (105kg) 170, while another, not observed to fall, has been discovered in Oregon and weighsno less than 14 metric tonnes 171 . Some meteorites are also unexpectedly young172 , and cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites generally suggest anastronomically recent disintegration of the original body 173 .In connection with metalliferous meteorites, it is interesting that Jews calliron nechoshet. This literally means 'droppings of the serpent' 174 . This is ameaningless term until we recall that, in Jewish traditions, the 'serpent' wasanother name for Satan, the old dragon, remembered elsewhere by a great varietyof other names including Typhon and Phaeton. The fact that ancient Midrashic andTalmudic accounts of the Phaeton visitation mention a celestial bombardment ofhot stones occurring then, that the early Egyptians called iron the 'bones ofTyphon' 17S , and that Finnish traditions refer to a prodigious fall of huge'ironhailstones' occurring when the world was once almost drowned by a great flood,all seem to be echoes of what, to modern man, would be falls of meteors. Thefalls of gravel featured in various Central American traditions seem to berecollections of the same general event. It must, furthermore, be relevant thatthe ancient Greek word for iron was sideros: this, when combined with theobviously related Latin word for star, sidus (genitive sideris, plural sidera)176 , as 'iron star', lends new meaning to the concept of a largepartially-metalliferous body which, when close to Earth, showered it with loosepieces in the form of meteor-like iron hailstones.The singular theme common to all these ancient traditions concerns the fact thatthese falls of metalliferous meteor-like bodies were inextricably part andparcel of a terrible cosmic visitation which almost destroyed Earth long ago.Significantly, the sizes and quantities of many modern meteorites and thosementioned in the traditions just cited, were such that they cannot be cometarydebris. On this point alone it follows that the celestial marauder we have beencalling Phaeton was not the comet that many earlier investigators of the Phaetoncycle of traditions have supposed.Ice and MethaneThe final class of celestial mavericks considered here concerns icy substances.We have already noted that various types of ice believedly exist in cometarynuclei. Several planetary satellites may also possess outer coatings of ice ormay consist totally of ice, and it is also thought that much ice exists on thefour largest planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - which someastronomers believe are composed mostly of hydrogen and ices of carbon, nitrogenand oxygen enveloped by an extremely cold deep atmosphere of ammonia and methane177 . All these substances, it will be remembered, are present in comets. Theconclusion that supercooled ice (at -200°F or more) is a relatively commonsubstance throughout the solar system 178 finds positive support from recentdiscoveries establishing that ice particles definitely occur in comets andpicture45 [images/picture45.jpg]Fig 4.9. Comet Morehouse. By permission ofYerkes Observatory, Wisconsin, USA.compose much of the rings of Saturn, and that sizable quantities of ice exist onat least three Jovian moons 179 .With these details before us, identification of the innumerable unheralded fallsof blocks of ice, peculiar icy hailstones and glutinous substances, which havedescended upon Earth from time to time as examples of further celestialmavericks may not be wholly irrelevant (see Appendix C). These disparate yetseemingly related objects may actually constitute vestiges of some infinitelygreater masses of similar material that fell upon Earth at the time of Phaeton'svisit. This is certainly suggested by the following details respecting theformation of hydrocarbons in space.As previously noted, methane is one of the most abundant molecules in the solarsystem. It is well-known that high temperatures are required to reduce methaneto aromatic hydrocarbons 180 . Interestingly, therefore, in ten Recent era(Holocene) sediments from Texas and Louisiana, both aromatic and aliphatichydrocarbons have been found, aged somewhere between 14,600 and 11,800 BP(±1,400 years) 181 . Their origin is uncertain, but, considering the datesobtained for them, it is not impossible that they were formed about or duringthe time of the Phaeton upheaval, a 'hot' event falling within the same timescale. Furthermore, hydrocarbons of high molecular weight - of which petroleumis one - comprise up to half the carbon content of carbonaceous chondriticmeteorites.The presence in varying quantities of such hydrocarbons in both comets andmeteors strongly suggests that, as noted above, while the latter are almostcertainly not derived from comets, the two classes of objects somehow share acommon origin. One of the substances apparently linking these objects andperhaps indicating their joint original source is methane.Petroleum is commonly thought of as having an organic (biogenic) origin, but itis now accepted that hydrocarbons, petroleum included, could be synthesised inspace by a free-radical mechanism from methyl radicals, in which:Methyl radicals themselves could be produced from solar photons on methane. 182Non-biogenic petroleum thus formed might, on reaching Earth, form lakes or pondswherever dense underlying strata prevented its natural absorption. Naturalevaporation of this volatile liquid would leave behind it a skin of crude oil orasphalt. Quite conceivably, the asphalt lakes of Trinidad and Venezuela and thetar seeps of California originated in this way - particularly as all areintimately associated with the remains of late-'Pleistocene' animals and plants,victims of a much wider calamity that appears to have erupted about 11,500 yearsago. That the mean average of the dates obtained for petroleum-bearing sedimentsin Texas and Louisiana falls remarkably close to this date is surely nocoincidence.Thus, whatever its real nature, if fiery ('hot') Phaeton was either itselfpartly composed of inflammable hydrocarbons developed from methane, or had,during its journey through the solar system, encountered a planetary bodyhaving, like Jupiter and Saturn 183 , a largely methane-dominated atmosphere, apart of which it had perhaps captured or acquired. Its late arrival in thevicinity of the Earth/Moon system as (so numerous traditions aver) a flamingobject of endlessly changing image, is at last explicable as that of an errantcelestial visitor wreathed in constantly shifting, igniting and exploding cloudsof methane. The aforementioned electromagnetic exchanges which would havenaturally occurred between Earth and Phaeton, and were part of the electricalphenomena accompanying the attendant geomagnetic reversal 184 , could also haveserved to ignite any hydrocarbon-laden atmosphere of the approachingastronomical visitor. In that connection readers will recall those traditionsgiven in Part Three describing vast inflammable clouds, tremendous aerialexplosions and terrible streams of fire directed upon Earth as leading elementsin humankind's collective memory of the Phaeton disaster.But if, as we shall shortly see, Phaeton apparently explosively destroyed amedium-sized planet beyond Mars, in all likelihood equipped with an atmosphere having asizable methane content, then any dispersed portions of that body, such as theiron hailstones of Finnish lore, and many hydrocarbon-permeated meteors andcomets, are respectively the stony and icy/gaseous remnants of the samenow-vanishedmethane-pervaded world. The general location of this lost planet is that nowloosely occupied by the asteroids, so Flandern's arguments about comets beingremnants of a bygone asteroid world, and Opik's suggestion that comets andplanets may have had a common genesis accordingly increase in interest.12 Signposts to a Cosmic Battlee-^3£i.f44&zr*It is unnecessary here to list all the many scholars who have investigated theproblems of axial shifts, changes in rotational speeds and polarity reversals,since thoroughly representative selections have been given on preceding pages.Significantly, most of these authorities agree that such changes could only beproduced by enormously powerful forces acting upon Earth externally. Given thatthese changes really occurred, then quite literally, a war between worlds musthave taken place. That, of course, is precisely what the traditions reviewed inPart Three assert.Our survey of the solar system recorded various anomalies, several of whichappear in table 4A and figs 4.6 and 4.7. Thus the Moon formerly circled theEarth more closely than it does now; Mercury's orbit is not circular; Venusrotates extremely slowly for its size, and in the opposite direction to all theother planets except Pluto; Earth has a non-circular orbit; Mars rotates tooslowly for its size, and has a decidedly eccentric orbit. It also has two smallirregularly-shaped satellites, Deimos and Phobos, hurtling round it atexceptionally high speed. Jupiter rotates extremely quickly for its size andmass, and, unlike all other planetary satellites, its two outermost known moonsorbit it from pole to pole, each in opposite directions. Its third largestsatellite, Callisto, exhibits unusually low density, suggesting to some thatit possibly consists almost entirely of ice - over 10 billion cubic miles of it(if true, this makes Callisto the largest known single piece of ice anywhere).Saturn also rotates unusually rapidly, follows a non-circular orbit, and isdistinguished by its wonderful ring system held by many to be the debris of oneor more fragmentised satellites. It, too, has several satellites consistingmostly of ice, as well as one, Phoebe, which orbits in a retrograde direction.Uranus, which follows a non-circular orbit, is another rapidly-rotating planet,and has its equator inclined at an extreme angle (NNW-SSE). The axis of Uranus'magnetic di-pole field is not only offset from the planet's centre, but,relative to the planet's axis of rotation, is located at the unexpectedly largeangle of 60°. It has been suggested that this possibly exemplifies a polarityreversal in operation and that this has conceivably arisen from \"a catastrophiccollision event subsequent to the formation of the planet, intimately related toits large and anomalous obliquity to the ecliptic\" 185 . Several of the Uraniansatellites, which also possess equatorial tilts of 90° 186 , show topographicfeatures suggestive of catastrophic alterations; Umbriel, for example, exhibitsa surprisingly \"young fresh surface\", and Titania a global network ofgeologically very young faults 187 .Although still quick, Neptune rotates more slowly and pursues an eccentricorbit. Both its moons orbit in a retrograde direction, of which the smaller,Nereid, following an enormously elongated orbit, takes no less than 359 days tocomplete just one circuit. Pluto rotates rather slowly, is a double planet withits satellite Charon, and has an orbit so highly eccentric that it intersectswith that of Neptune. We have seen, too, that the origin of the asteroid beltbetween Mars and Jupiter is debatable, and that many of its constituent membersorbit the Sun eccentrically. Meteors exhibit behaviour patterns which are evenmore eccentric; yet, although regarded by some as remnants of cometary tails ordead cometary nuclei, their origins are still unknown. Notwithstanding that,they clearly represent the debris of something. We have suggested, however,that, along with blocks of celestial ice which occasionally fall to Earth andthe likelihood that non-biogenic petroleum can be produced from methane bynatural chemical methods in space, meteors could be surviving fragments of oneor more large solid bodies which have disintegrated.The overall picture thus presented by the solar system shows that its principalmembers comprise a basically orderly assemblage of rotating and orbiting objectsthat have apparently experienced various derangements resulting in all kinds ofaberrant and anomalous motions which, although of comparatively minor importancefor the working of the solar system as a whole, have apparently been caused byone or more unknown influences in the past.The outstanding question here, of course, is whether all these anomalies haveaccumulated over aeons of time - as the result of many essentially isolateddisturbances, each of relatively local extent - or whether they represent theoutcome of a single larger disruptive event affecting the solar systemgenerally. The forces which generated the larger anomalies - for example, theacute hiring of Uranus, and the warping of Pluto's highly eccentric orbit - musthave been so powerful that it is difficult to see how this could have alsofailed to affect other bodies in the solar family.If the former interpretation of these anomalies is adopted, then it follows thatvarious disruptions of the solar system are, by astronomical standards,comparatively frequent, and the history of the solar system could justifiably besaid to be recurrently catastrophic. If, on the other hand, a single largedisturbance - responsible for all, or at least the majority of, the observedanomalies - is the preferred interpretation, then the history of the solarsystem can be best defined as normally quiet and orderly but punctuated recentlyby a single tremendous cataclysm. The following details indicate that the latterinterpretation, though startling, is almost certainly correct.According to observations made by Mariner-4, the Martian orbit has apparentlybeen seriously disturbed and the planet's structure severely strained at sometime in the past. Aligned stress fractures observed on the Martian crust haveled to the conclusion that:...such a lineament system is caused by stresses in the planet's crust producedby changes in the planet's rotational equilibrium figure... The changes inangular velocity caused by tidal interaction of Mars with Phobos and Deimos arecompletely negligible and that of the Sun is a few percent at most: thus othermechanisms must be sought 188 .These observations appear to go hand-in-hand with the fact that the Martianmagnetic field is presently no greater than 3 x lCr 4 and has apparently beenreduced by some means 189 . Moreover, calculations made of the mass and angularmomentum of Mars when compared with other members of the solar system, result inan ideal axial rotation of 8 hours. Actually the rotation is slightly over 24hours, so Mars has somehow slowed considerably, an anomaly which has promptedthe question:How could its rotation have been slowed in the absence of substantial tidaleffects? Loss of a massive Martian satellite - greater than the mass of Cereswould be needed - but where is it now?. 190F F Fish was equally puzzled when he concluded:Mars... either must have lost considerable angular momentum or never possessedthe initial angular momentum that would be inferred. 191We have previously mentioned that Earth's axial rotation may have been speededup from a possible former 30-hour day to its present 24-hour day, so it isentirely conceivable that the Martian day has somehow slowed down, and perhapsfrom the same underlying cause.Turning now to asteroids, we may note the fairly widespread view that they arethe degassed relict nuclei of comets captured by Jupiter over aeons of time -although this is admittedly debatable 192 . The rocky composition and greatrelative size of some of the asteroids suggests that a cometary origin for themis unlikely, so their genesis must lie elsewhere. Efforts have been made tocalculate the original mass of a single body to which all the asteroids mighthave once belonged, but this proved to be only 0.03 of that of the Moon 1 \" 3 ,so either a very small hypothetical world formerly orbited where the asteroidbelt now exists, or numerous fragments of it are now absent from the belt - inwhich case that world must have been correspondingly larger. It is surelysignificant that some asteroids appear to exist as families through the break-upof a larger body, whereby the relevant pieces now orbit close together. TheKoronis family of 18 separate pieces is one such group.Some of these groups orbit the Sun very eccentrically. The Apollo family, forexample, overlaps Earth's orbit at perihelion (the closest part of the orbit tothe Sun), and of its 40-odd members, over 15 are continuous crossers of Earth'sorbit. The 10 strong Amor group although only occasionally crossing Earth'sorbit always crosses the Martian orbit. Both these asteroid groups follow orbitsthat actually pass obliquely through the main asteroid belt. This suggests thatthey have been pulled out from the main asteroid swarm by some passinggravitational force, or ejected as a result of a collision with some largerbody. Alternatively, they may not be true asteroids at all.Flidalgo is the name of another eccentrically-orbiting body. Although usuallyclassed as a minor planet, this small rocky object has a Jupiter-crossing orbit,and may actually be a large asteroid 194 . Interestingly, when it was firstdiscovered by Baade, doubt arose as to whether it was a genuine minor planet ora comet because it exhibited diffuseness. Similar uncertainty attended thediscovery of Comet Arend-Rigaux, because, although its orbit resembled that of aminor planet, it appeared to be very diffuse 195 . Irrespective of their realidentities, both objects have clearly been deranged at some time in the past.Yet other eccentrically-orbiting objects of doubtful origin, but clearly pulledout of kilter from some now-altered earlier regime, and apparently in thenot-too-distant past at that, are the recently discovered Pholus and object 1992QB. Pholus lies beyond Saturn's orbit and 1992 QB lies beyond Neptune's 196 .The latter appears to be connected in some manner with the Kuiper Belt, whichlies at or near the edge of our solar system, which we shall consider againshortly.All these eccentrically orbiting objects have led some to speculate whetherasteroids and meteors, despite now following widely varying orbits, once shareda common origin. Both are almost invariably stony, meteors frequentlycharacterised by a high iron or iron-nickel content - a detail suggesting toSears that iron meteorites conceivably formed in the asteroid belt 197 . VanFlandern has examined the possibility that comets may have originated from thedisintegration of a solid planet-sized body formerly existing where the asteroidbelt now occurs 198 . Presumably the aggregations and groups of stony debristhat would form in free space after the fragmentation of such a solid bodywould, as they settled down into orbits, form their own weak but distinctivegravitational fields and attract dissociated ions and electrons from the plasmanow believed to pervade interplanetary and interstellar space. By such means, itwas suggested, comets could be born.The erstwhile existence of a planet orbiting where the asteroid belt now lieshas been discussed by many writers, including Ovenden, who examined theproposition inrelation to Bode's Law 1 '\", first formulated in 1772. Johann Bode observed theregularly increasing distances of the planets from the Sun, and noted that therewas a vacant orbit between Mars and Jupiter. It was, of course, the search forthe planet thought to follow this orbit that led to the discovery of the firstasteroid in 1801.A distinct possibility exists, therefore, that asteroids, meteors and cometsshare a common origin, and that meteors and the large blocks of free-orbitingcelestial ice are the remnants of something larger which broke up. If true, thenmany comets may be of comparatively very recent origin. Ages ranging from 10million years or more to 10,000 years or less have been proposed by differentauthorities for comets, but the fact is, nobody really knows how old comets are.Therefore, the possibility exists - as some have suggested - that comets couldbe replenished from some source beyond the solar system. Certainly at least ahigh percentage of, if not all, comets may have formed from the debris of somelarger body which disintegrated in the not-so-distant past.If such an event occurred, then the a-forementioned icy missiles presumablyrepresent frozen fluids and gases dispersed in all directions at the time ofthat disintegration, but which have since settled down into eccentric orbitsaround the Sun. Such ice masses would imply that the original parent object wassufficiently large to have supported some kind of atmosphere, more akin perhapsto that of Jupiter or Saturn than to that of Earth, and con-taining more methane than the terrestrial atmosphere. Methane, we have noted, isevidently more common in planetary atmospheres furthest from the Sun - thus anysizable planet formerly orbiting between Mars and Jupiter very possiblypossessed an atmosphere containing more methane than those of Earth or Mars, butless than those of Jupiter or the outer planets.We must also refer here to the anomalous minor planet Chiron, which was onlydiscovered in the late 1970's, orbiting between Saturn and Uranus. Chironappears to be either a very large satellite which has 'escaped' from one ofthose planets, or is an asteroid or a dead cometary nucleus 'captured' by one ofthem and diverted into its present orbit 200 . As yet little is known about it,although it is immediately obvious that its size and position violates Bode'sLaw. But reviewing Chiron in conjunction with the anomalous tilting ofneighbouring Uranus' rotational axis, the orbital eccentricity of both Neptuneand Pluto and the retrograde motion of Neptune's two moons, it is equallyobvious that something out of the ordinary has occurred in the far confines ofthe solar system and disturbed the outer planets and their satellites. Othershave noted this state of affairs as well 201 ' 296 .All the foregoing, therefore, are apparently signposts to what seems to havebeen a celestial calamity which affected the greater part of the solar system atsome time in the past, and which, as we shall later see, left free-moving debrisranging over wide areas of it.13The Candidates«^^fe.;-*i2i^-»We have seen that any external agent capable of slowing or halting Earth'srotation, or of tilting the terrestrial spin axis to some new angle, wouldnecessarily haveto be exceedingly powerful. If a lone agent or influence was involved, it wouldhave to possess large mass and high electromagnetic potential. If several agentsacted in concert,then their collective mass and electromagnetic fields would still need to besufficiently powerful to produce such radical Earth changes. Our search,therefore, will be for some agency capable of fulfilling these rather specialrequirements.The foregoing survey of maverick objects in the solar system clearly shows that,despite the relatively great size of the largest of them, none remotelypossesses the mass needed to materially affect Earth's rotation or engender anaxial shift. On the contrary, nearly all these objects themselves sufferperturbation, division or destruction if they venture too close to even thesmallest planets.Thus, unless there formerly existed maverick objects which were literallythousands of times more massive than the largest examples known today, no suchobject can have radically affected Earth. Although this observation also appliesto conventional comets, so little is yet known about the recently discoveredgiant interstellar comets 202 that inevitably the possibility persists that suchobjects possess sufficiently massive nuclei as to cause the tremendous physicaldisturbances detailed in this book. Conceivably these objects may not, in fact,be true comets at all, but merely resemble them superficially.We may, therefore, dismiss those earlier theories which postulated an asteroidor giant meteor, or a bolide 2 \" 7 , as the cause of the disaster. Similarly,those which ascribe the calamity to a comet may also be discarded, sinceconventional comets lack the mass required to effect the relevant physicalchanges, either terrestrially or elsewhere in the solar system. We may note,however, that Velikovsky, who advocated a comet as the causal agent, recognisedthe necessity of involving a planet-sized object (which he went on to identifyas the present planet Venus).Having eliminated meteors, asteroids and conventional comets from our list ofcandidates, we proceed to the next largest class of celestial objects - thesatellites. These exist in almost all sizes in the solar system, ranging fromsmall irregularly-shaped moons, like those orbiting Mars, to the huge satellites(Ganymede, Titan and Triton) larger than our Moon. The composition of thesatellites varies considerably. Rocky and comparatively heavy examples, like theMoon, are known while others, such as Callisto, are surprisingly lightweight andprobably consist mostly of ice. Obviously only the most massive satellites(those as large as our Moon) qualify for consideration here.Yet, although Bellamy has attempted to explain the great physical disturbancesof 11,500 years or so ago as the result of the disintegration of an earlierTertiary satellite of Earth, and the subsequent capture of our present Moon 203, the existence of the former was actually never more than hypothetical, and theMoon itself is insufficiently massive to have perpetrated the immense upheavalscharacterising those disturbances. Nor are any other satellitic bodies knownwhich could have produced those violent events. It thus follows that satellitescan be safely eliminated from our list of candidates too.Planets constitute the next group of candidates. We have seen that, althoughmost circle the Sun on what may be conveniently termed 'fixed orbits', certainsmall planets -notably Hidalgo and Pluto - pursue highly eccentric orbits, or,like Chiron, have apparently been displaced and forced into new orbits which nowconfound Bode's Law. The orbital stability of the planets is therefore far frombeing immutable, although only very powerful forces could cause orbital changesor propel even small (let alone large) planets into new ones. No evidence existsfor Hidalgo or any other minor planet having ever approached Earth close enoughto affect its rotation or axial tilt, or that Mars or Venus ever caused orcontributed to the widespread terrestrial changes previously mentioned 204 .Nevertheless, many ancient records repeatedly refer to the involvement of thosetwo planets in a celestial drama coincident with great physical upheavals onEarth. However, Mulholland has stated that:...The available observational data suggest strongly that no planet-sized objecthas passed near Earth in historic time, and probably not for a much longertime... 205 .Nonetheless, something capable of exerting a tremendous influence approachedEarth closely about 11,500 years ago and left many mementos of the encounter.The accomplishment of these effects necessitated the interaction of an influenceapproaching planetary dimensions - something close either to Earth's mass anddensity (see table 4A), or of smaller mass and greater density. It seemsunlikely that a larger object was concerned, for had that been the case then theEarth would probably have disintegrated according to Roche's Law, which we willexamine shortly.We have exhausted all possible candidates (likely and unlikely) within the solarsystem and are left to consider others which, perforce, would have possessedmore distant origins. Of these, the idea of a passing star (sun) is toounlikely, for it would have incinerated the entire planetary concourse -thus,like Patten 206 , we dismiss it. Yet, we should not overlook the fact thatspecialist studies of stars nearest the solar system indicate that relativelyclose stellar encounters are not only much more frequent than generallybelieved, but occur near enough astronomically to perturb even very longdistance comets 207 .Just conceivably, one of the aforementioned giant interstellar 'comets'traversed the solar system some 11,500 years ago, wreaking havoc among the Sun'sfamily, much as Clube and Napier have suggested 208 . There is, however, no firmscientific evidence for definitely identifying the astronomical visitor as suchan object, and one may just as reasonably suppose that a large and highlydangerous supernova fragment entered the solar system at high velocity aroundthat date. It is interesting that about 40 novae erupt annually in our galaxyalone, and a supernova roughly every 30 years 20 ''. Thus -assuming that theserates have remained more or less constant for, say, the last 15,000 years - noless than 600,000 novae and 500 supernovae have occurred in our galaxy duringthat period.Supernovae are actually quite common cosmic events, some 600 of them having beenobserved among the nearer galaxies since the1930s 21 \". Of the supernovae recorded in our galaxy,' a surprising number haveexploded unexpectedly near the solar system within the last 15,000 years 211 -at least five between 15,000 and 11,500 years BP Of these, the Vela supernova -an exploded star (G263.9-3.3) situated at the unusually close astronomicaldistance of d=500pc from the solar system -could be a likely candidate, asrecent calculations suggest that it erupted either some 14,300 years 212 orabout 11,000 years ago 213 . Both these dates fall within the 'right' intervalbefore the onset of the Phaeton disaster.It should, however, be remembered that if this particular scenario has any meritat all, then the velocity at which the Phaeton 'object' traversed theintervening regions of interstellar space would be the most critical factor.Certainly, on such a lengthy journey through an all-pervading plasma ofdissociated ions and electrons, any such high-speed object could be expected toacquire a high electromagnetic potential in addition to any electrical ormagnetic field it already possessed. Such an object would be extremelydangerous.Although it is impossible at this juncture to positively pinpoint Phaeton's realidentity, and we can merely state what it was not, it must surely transcendcoincidence that the gamma-ray spectrometer on the Third High EnergyAstronomical Observatory satellite (HEAO 3) has lately detected a highconcentration or cloud of Aluminium-26 ( 26 A1) in space, surrounding the solarsystem. 26 A1 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about one millionyears, and, according to theoretical studies, is readily produced in supernovaexplosions. Ultimately 2f Al decays to Magnesium-26, but as this cloud isapparently still very much Aluminium-26 and not Magnesium-26, its decay is notvery far advanced and suggests that the cloud may be as young as a mere 10,000years 214 .If the cloud truly represents supernova debris, then the original explosionmust, by astronomical standards, have occurred very close to the solar system.An original source no more distant than 45 light-years has, in fact, beenproposed for this cloud 215 .The location of this high concentration of Alurninium-26 on the outer edge ofthe solar system is of special interest in relation to the location of theKuiper Belt mentioned earlier. Recent observations made from universities inCalifornia and Hawaii have confirmed the reality of this Belt, the existence ofwhich was first proposed by the astronomer Gerard Kuiper in 1951 216 . The Belthas been shown to be composed of numerous (probably thousands) of tiny planetoidobjects - not unlike those comprising the Asteroid Belt considered earlier. Mostof the objects appear to be very small, but two at least are apparently as largeas 150 miles (240km) across, and still larger ones may well await futurediscovery. Actually locating and identifying such small objects across theenormous distance separating them from Earth is extremely difficult, so thediscovery of larger bodies in this Belt may not occur for years. Nevertheless,the apparent orbit of these objects brings them for a while inside that ofeccentrically orbiting Pluto, and some astronomers have already begun to wonderif the Kuiper Belt represents the disintegrated remains of a once much largerobject formerly orbiting the Sun far out on the edge of the solar system as weknow it.It has been noticed that Uranus seems to have changed its speed round the Sun inJune 1987, and at least one astronomer has theorised that this may have resultedfrom Uranus colliding with an unknown object which, to have achieved thateffect, would have had to have had a diameter of some 600 miles (960km) - smallby astronomical standards but considerably larger than any Kuiper Belt objectyet recorded. Pluto's lone satellite, Charon, is only 700 miles (1,120km) or soin diameter, and thus scarcely larger than the object supposed to have speededup Uranus' motion around the Sun. But Pluto's orbit is twice crossed by that ofthe Kuiper Belt objects, so Charon being a captured body from the Kuiper Belt isnot unreasonable. Likewise the aforementioned object 1992 QB, presently orbitingeccentrically between the orbits of Neptune and Pluto, is also quite possibly asmall world which has broken away from the main swarm of Kuiper Belt objects.Certainly the removal from theKuiper Belt swarm of several objects of 700 miles (1,120km) diameter or largerrenders the possibility that the size of the original object now represented bythe Kuiper Belt swarm, Charon, 1992 QB and the theoretical 600 mile (960km)object which affected Uranus' speed, was appreciable and large enough to beregarded as a true planet. This, we shall discover, is a significant possibilitywhen, shortly, we discuss Phaeton's recorded movements among the outer planets.On the basis of the above-mentioned details, we suggest that Phaeton was spawnedin an astronomically-near supernova explosion, and that Phaeton was a portion ofexploded astral matter. We further suggest that, being of that nature, Phaetonprecipitated a second astronomically far smaller explosion, on coming intoconfrontation with the combined gravitational and electromagnetic fields of thehuge outer planets of the solar system, and that this produced the Aluminium-26cloud now known to exist on the edge of the solar system. The above-cited detailthat the astronomically-close Vela supernova exploded some time between 14,300and 11,000 years ago indicates that, allowing for the time taken by Phaeton totraverse interstellar space between the point of its original disruption -45light years distant - and the outer confines of the solar system, the planetaryderangements under discussion probably took place approximately 11,500 yearsago!Assuming for the moment that Phaeton, after initially disrupting, subsequentlytravelled at high velocity on a course destined to bisect the solar system, itneed not have actually moved at more than one fiftieth of the speed of light tohave covered the distance represented by 45 light years in just a few hundredyears. If proceeding at only one hundredth the speed of light it would stillhave completed the distance in slightly less than one thousand years, and itwould have been within the time-frame calculated for the Vela supernova eventgenerally. Viewed from this aspect, the possibility of Phaeton having been anastral body, a remnant of a supernova, becomes entirely plausible.*The apparent youthfulness of the cloud of Aluminium-26 suggests theastronomically-close occurrence of a major cosmic event like a supernova within geologicallyrecent times. Phaeton certainly entered and caused havoc throughout the solarsystem during times which, though ancient in terms of human endeavour, weregeologically very recent.There are, therefore, good reasons for supposing that all these seeminglydisparate details are actually pieces of the same tremendous drama - one whichembraced the entire solar system and left as its legacy after effects that stillaffect the Earth.14Phaeton - an Exception to the Rule«T*3±*****sr»A further avenue of approach respecting . the real identity of Phaeton comesfrom the eye-witness descriptions of it preserved in the numerous traditions andlegends mentioned in Part Three. A supplementary survey of these follows below,during which we shall generally refer to Phaeton by that name irrespective ofthe plethora of other appellations by which it has been remembered.Firstly, in the surviving original fragmentary accounts by Hyginus, Euripidesand Ovid, Phaeton is specifically called by that name and always described as abright fiery body. The name actually signifies 'the shining one', an appropriatetitle for an entity anciently regarded as the son of the sun-god Helios.Referring to Phaeton as Typhon, the Roman writer Pliny tells us much the samething:...it had a fiery appearance and was twisted like a coil, and it was very grimto behold: it was not really a star so much as what might be called a ball offire... 217 .The seventeenth century savant, Adam Rockenbach, who claimed to have drawn uponthe most reliable of the earliest writers (including works now lost), added:It was fiery, of irregular circular form, with a wrapped head; it was in theshape of aglobe and was of terrible aspect... in the form of a disc... 218 .Significantly, Avienus likened it to a great sickle 21 \", perhaps a descriptionof a globular body illuminated on one side only.An ancient Jewish tradition states that the Deluge was caused by: \"...the LordGod changing the places of two stars in a constellation\" 220 , thus specificallyidentifying Phaeton as a fiery star-like body rather than a comet. The same ideawas embedded in Persian legend. The bright fiery Tistrya was styled: \"...theleader of the stars against the planets\" 221 .* This stars-versus-planetsconflict was obviously witnessed by early people and we shall have more to sayabout it shortly.The Salishan Indians of North America mention a pre-catastrophic period when theSun was no bigger than a star 222 , presumably an allusion to the small size ofthe Sunlike Phaeton when still far distant from the Earth.This closely parallels the ancient Hindu account of Brahma and his attendantsobserving the arrival in the heavens of \"an exceedingly small\" white boar-shapedbody which: \"...in the space of an hour, grew to the size of an elephant of thelargest size, and remained in the air\" 223 , prior to it plunging to Earth andcausing a worldwide flood. Chinese traditions similarly tell how, duringthe time of the legendary emperor Ya-hou: \"...a brilliant star issued from theconstellation of Yin\" 224 , prior to a tremendous global upheaval.Again, Ta-vi is described in tribal legends from southern California as astar-like or sunlike body rather than a cometary object. It allegedly roamed theskies at will and sometimes came close to Earth in its heavenly wanderings,scorching it, like Phaeton, in the process 225 . And correctly-interpretedobservations of unusually moving 'stars' permitted the Peruvian deluge-hero toseek a mountain refuge prior to the advent of a world-drowning flood 226 .The foregoing makes it perfectly clear that Phaeton was anciently regarded as agenerally round, brilliantly fiery body of appreciable size, and much morestar-like or sun-like than conventional comets: and it was held to have in someway caused the Deluge.Many traditions, however, refer to two or more cosmic visitors assailing Earthsimultaneously* The Norse sagas refer to two rampaging celestial 'monsters', theFenris-Wolf and the Midgard Serpent, that brought death and ruin to the ancientworld. Described as coursing through the heavens side by side, they acted inconcert, and reputedly sired the equally dreadful 'sons of Muspelheim' - Surt,Loke and Garm - a detail shown later to be of considerable significance. OldPersian texts mention an essentially similar pair of ravaging marauders, Ahrimanand its snake-like offspring Azhidhaka 227 , or, in other versions, Zohak andIblis 228 , which subjected Earth to all kinds of disasters. The reportedserpen-tiform or dragon-like aspects of these assailants is noteworthy.Even scriptural literature refers to a great war anciently fought in heavenbetween Lucifer (Satan) and his hosts and Michael and his angels. The formerwere ultimately vanquished by the latter and \"cast down onto Earth\" 229 . TheBook of Revelation specifically identifies Lucifer with: \"...the dragon, thatold serpent, which is the Devil and Satan\" 230 .Other biblical sources award different names to these antagonists, sometimessimul-* See Note 15.taneously furnishing additional details. Thus, in a prophetically phrasedpassage we read:In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punishLeviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent; and Heshall slay the dragon that is in the sea 211 .Elsewhere we find:Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? 232 .In Psalms we hear of Rahab (evidently another name for one of the assailants)again: \"Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces\" 233 , and: \"...thou didst break theheads of the dragons on the waters\" 234 .Traditionally, the destruction of these cosmic 'monsters' was almost alwaysassociated with water in one form or another. Thus, such phrases as 'in the sea'and 'on the waters' immediately remind us of Apollonius Rhodius's statementthat, after being felled by Zeus's thunderbolts, Typhon lay beneath theSerbonian Lake; and the tremendous flood that allegedly issued from Satan'smouth after he had fallen to Earth; and the flood that reputedly gushed out ofTa-wats 'eyes' on coming to pieces after careering madly over the burning Earth.Despite their internal differences, these accounts clearly refer to the sameoriginal event.The changing and varied visual appearances of these extraordinary visitors alsoprovides further insights into the apparent nature of these bodies. Most often,they are described as writhing dragons or coiling serpents, and are sometimessaid to have been multi-headed, to have displayed wide-gaping jaws, tusks,horns, sparkling crowns, or glowing manes and hair-like appendages, to have hadspeckled bodies and to have jetted great streams of fire from their imaginedmouths. Other accounts mention the emission of pestilential clouds, poisonousblasts and rains of 'red milk' or 'blood'; while yet others refer to theirproduction ofpicture46 [images/picture46.jpg]Fig 4.10a.

Scale diagram showing the disposition of the Ardmarnoch rock motifs.picture48 [images/picture48.jpg]Fig 4.10c. The Ardmarnoch rock motifs redrawn torepresent a similarly-arranged group of fiery celestialobjects. This representation, although agreeing well withworld tradition, is purely hypothetical.hissing, roaring, thunderous or explosive sounds. It is also clear that each ofthese cosmic assailants possessed considerable bulk and mass. And since at leastone of these objects (Phaeton) was reportedly only a little less brilliant thanthe Sun, the above descriptions, though diverse, collectively suggest thatincandescent, electromagneti-cally excited bodies of matter were undergoing allmanner of ever-changing images and trailing agitated trains of gases and debris.That such images and descriptions closely mirror those forecastable for a'stellar' visitor which, making a hypothetically close approach to Earth, waswrapped in igniting and exploding methane clouds productive of great jets offiery hydrocarbons and poisonous blasts, is yet another aspect of this topicwhich it would be irresponsible to ignore.Unquestionably the bodies involved were not abnormally large comets, meteors orasteroids familiar to modern astronomers. They were entirely different cosmicvisitors. In short, Phaeton and its alleged companions were exceptions to therule.To survivors of this catastrophe, the sight of these objects plunging as a groupacross the heavens - a scene no doubt repeatedly obscured by the chronicallyderanged terrestrial atmosphere - was a never-to-be-forgotten experience, and appears to have subsequently led people to commemoratethem in stone carvings. A possible example of such a carving adorns a large flatrock at Ardmarnoch in western Scotland 235 - at least one scholar 236 likenedthe sinuous lines streaming out from apparently glowing nuclei of comets (figs4.10ab). Accepting for the moment that this carving does represent this ancientcelestial drama and that it is reasonably accurate, it is possible toreconstruct (fig 4.10c) how these objects may have looked all those millenniaago. Certainly, if interpreted in this manner, the carving transmits preciselythe kind of picture or spectacle so often described in tradition and epicliterature. Again we ask if this, too, can be mere coincidence?It is noteworthy that astronomical subjects were seemingly recorded quite oftenin other European megalithic structures, themselves apparently coeval with theabove Scottish example 237 , that at least some had lunar and apparentlycalendrical significance 238 , and that, when assessed collectively, suchmonuments betray a surprising degree of understanding of astronomical phenomenagenerally among Neolithic peoples who raised the megaliths 239 . In that respectit would therefore have been remarkable had they not attempted to portrayPhaeton's visit in their rock carvings.15 The Mesopotamian Connection«Ts*fe-*«J*sr»Iike many other early nations, the ancient _/ Mesopotamians possessed a fullaccount of this celestial war preserved on tablets found in the library of the7th century BC monarch Assurbanipal in the ruined city of Nineveh 298 . Thesetablets name the principal antagonists as Tiamat, a 'dragon-monster' 299 , andMarduk, aneffulgent hero 300 considered to be the most radiant deity after Apsu, thesupreme Sun-god 301 .A baked clay cylinder-seal made by the Akkadian civilisation of Mesopotamia, andpreserved as specimen VA/243 at the Vorderasiatische Abteilung of the StateMuseum in eastern Berlin 302 , depicts the solarsystem as known to the Sumerians in the third millennium BC 303 . It showseleven globes encircling a large rayed star representing the Sun (fig 4.11a).The globes are generally thought to be planets, and their disposition is seenmore clearly in fig 4.11b. Other cylinder-seals showing deities (Sun-gods?)orbited by eleven planets are also known. The relevant portions of some of themare given here as figs 4.11c and 4.11d.Discounting tiny Chiron, modern astronomy recognises only nine planets in thesolar system - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune andPluto. If we elevate the Moon to planetary status, as the Sumerians appear tohave done, then we have a total of ten planets orbiting the Sun today. On thisbasis one planet is currently still missing from the earlier Sumerian total.Why, therefore, do the modern and Sumerian totals differ? Is this differencereal or imaginary? Did the original seal-makers err in showing eleven planets?Could there really have been another planet known to the Sumerians, as yetunknown to us or lost since their day? If so, when and how was this planet lost?Could its disappearance, if real, be connected in any way with the Phaetonevent? Such questions demand answers.It is especially noteworthy that the most accomplished astronomers of antiquitywere the Sumerians and Chaldeans' 04 (early Babylonians) of the third and fourthcenturies BC, from which it hardly seems likely that they would repeatedlydepict one planet too many on their cylinder-seals. Once, just possibly;repeatedly no. The level of astronomical knowledge in the ancient Near East 305more than confirms the apparent accuracy of these cylinder-seals and that noerror was committed.That the ancients recognised the existence of at least six planets - Mercury,Venus, Luna (Moon), Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - in addition to the Sun, is wellknown, and some also knew that the Earth was a planet too. These bodies, ofcourse, were known by different names among different nations, several of whichwe shall have occasion to mention.It was not until 1781 that modern astronomy discovered Uranus, 1846 Neptune and1930 Pluto. Many early astronomers, however, apparently knew that these planetsexisted and even had names for them.While Nicolaus Copernicus is justly called the 'Father of Modern Astronomy', inreality he only rediscovered (in 1543) the central position of the Sun in thesolar system, for the same celestial arrangement was apparently known toAristarchus of Samos in the third century BC, and to others before him 306 . Twohundred years earlier, for instance, the Greeks had listed the planets in theircorrect order from the Sun, thereby acknowledging that the Sun, not Earth, wasthe centre of the solar system. In discussing the exactness and accuracy ofMesopotamian astronomy generally, Diodorus Siculus, who lived in the firstcentury BC, noted:...the Chaldeans named the planets. In the centre of their system was the Sun,the greatest light, of which the planets were 'offspring', reflecting the Sun'sposition and shine... Each of the planets according to them has its ownparticular course, and its velocities and periods of time are subject to changeand variation... the Moon's light is reflected and her eclipses are due to theshadow of the Earth 240 .The orbital and velocity variations mentioned by Diodorus are stronglysuggestive of the fact that Chaldean astronomers knew of the equivalentterrestrial variations highlighted earlier in IV:7 on Stability. Possession ofsuch advanced knowledge at so early a date would not have been unlikely among arace also cognisant of the precession of the equinoxes and the Great Year 307 .These same Chaldeans are also accredited by Geminus of Rhodes as having been thefirst to determine the exact motions of the Moon 241 .Flipparchus, during the second century BC, knew of and understood the precessionof the equinoxes 308 . These are inexplicable unless 'spherical astronomy' issubscribed to, and only after the arrival in a given zodiacal sign(constellation) of Spring in relation to the Sun's position (as seen fromEarth). The slow shift of the equinox point from one zodiacal constellation toanother requires 2,160 years to complete, a period far too long to permit anyone astronomer to make the relevant observations himself 09 .

After E.D. Van Buren\" .and actually acknowledged that his mentors were \"Babylonian astronomers ofErech, Borsippa and Babylon\" 242 .The zodiacal signs themselves date from extreme antiquity 312 , for Prof AlfredJeremias found evidence that a Sumerian clay tablet in the Berlin Museum (VAT7847) begins a list of named zodiacal constellations with the name Leo (theLion), which projects us back to 11,000 BC or thereabouts - the time when theequinox point was in the constellation Leo 243 . This suggests that the zodiachad been devised even before the Phaeton disaster.Professor Herman Hilprecht investigated the subject still further. Afteranalysing thousands of baked clay tablets bearing mathematical tabulations heconcluded that:...all the multiplication and division tables from the temple libraries ofNippur and Sippar, and from the library of Assurbanipal are based upon 12960000244 .Analysing the significance of this number, Hilprecht decided that it couldrelate only to the precession of the equinoxes and that the Sumerians knew ofthe Great Year of 25,920 years 313 . This is sometimes called the PlatonianYear, for apparently Plato, too, was aware of the phenomenon 314 .Assyrian, Chaldean and Sumerian astronomers accurately monitored the movementsand positions of many celestial bodies relative to Earth and to one another, andkept precise ephemerides - tables that predicted and listed the future positionsof the celestial bodies 315 . These tables were examined by Prof George Sarton245 . He found that they were computed by two methods 316 which, as ProfNeugebauer subsequently discovered, were based not on observations by theastronomers who produced them but compiled \"...from some fixed mathematicalschemes... which were given and were not to be interfered with\" 246 .These mathematical schemes were very old, for even the Assyrian astronomers didnot fully comprehend them and were able to use them only with the aid of\"procedure texts\" 317 which provided \"the rules for computing ephemerides stepby step\" according to some \"strict mathematical theory\" 318 . This proved tobe so advanced or obscure that, as Neugebauer admitted, its \"...empirical andtheoretical foundation\" 319 largely escapes modern scholars as well.A clay tablet from Ur, dating from the third millennium BC, lists and describesa series of celestial bodies so carefully and accurately, that modernastronomers have had little hesitation in recognising the text as aclassification of the constellations, which, in addition to the twelve zodiacalgroupings, include the northern constellations of Draco, Ursa Major, Lyra,Cygnus, Cepheus and Triangulum, and the southern ones of Canis Major, Orion,Centaurus, Corvus and Hydra 320 . This is interesting because, so far as isknown, the Sumerian astronomers were the first to divide the heavens into threeregions or 'ways' 321 . Of these, the northern 'way' was named after Enlil, thesouthern after Ea and the central one (which contained the zodiacalconstellations) after Ann. Rather soberingly we have to record here that it wasnot until 1925 that modern astronomers, after much discussion, decided to dividethe heavens, as seen from Earth, into three regions 322 . The modern and theancient tripartite divisions are remarkably similar.The names Ea, Anu and Enlil are especially interesting here for they providefurther indications of the advanced levels attained by the early Mesopotamianastronomers and suggest that they knew a great deal about what actually happenedat the time of Phaeton's visitation. Ea and Anu were the Sumerian names for theplanets respectively known today as Neptune and Uranus. The existence of theseplanets was known to these astronomers and is presumably the reason why bothappear on the aforementioned cylinder-seals.Enlil is a particularly interesting name, for Sykes 247 has noted that: Lilmeant 'demon' in several ancient Middle East dialects, whereby Enlil may havesignified something like 'Demon Lord'; and that the Assyrians often referred toEnlil as Bel, who, in turn, was almost certainly identical with theheavenly-hero Marduk (alias Phaeton).In Sumerian mythology Enlil was regarded as Ami's eldest son and the prince ofthe Sumerian pantheon, being second only in rank to the supreme Sun-god Apsu.Later, Enlil appears to have transgressed divine laws, whereupon he was banishedto the 'underworld'. Can it be coincidence that Lucifer (Satan), who wasoriginally second only to God, was eventually thrown out of heaven and cast downinto a 'bottomless pit', or that Phaeton, who was nearly as radiant as Helios(the Sun), was ultimately destroyed and his remains thrown down from the skiesand buried under the Earth? The same theme recurs in Norse mythology about theprimeval giant, Ymir, who, formed of fire and water, once waged war against thewhole world and was only overcome by the gods Odin, Vili and Ve who flung hisbody into Gimingagap, a vast chasm which Ymir in his rage had caused to open inthe Earth's crust 248 . The belief that a universal Deluge arose after Athrajen,hero of the North African Kabyles, had slain a marauding giant named ¥ err aimand hurled his carcass into a lake called Thamgurth 249 , strongly suggests thathe and Ymir were identical with the Deluge-inducing Lucifer or Phaeton.Ginungagap is reminiscent of the great world crack or fissure discussed in PartOne, an appropriate 'tomb' for anything consigned to it, and aptly described inlater times as the 'underworld' or 'bottomless pit'.Enlil, therefore, seems to be yet another title of Phaeton, while the 'way' ofEnlil in the Sumerian tripartite division of the heavens appears to refer to theregions whence Enlil originated or which it traversed after entering the solarsystem. In that connection it is worthnoting that the Phaeton legend refers to the Milky Way as the track taken by thefiery chariot of Helios, the stars being its scattered ashes; that the BrazilianBorros believe the Milky Way to be an ash trail left by a great conflagration(fiery object - Phaeton); that an early Indian name for the Milky Way was 'Pathof the Serpent' 250 ; and that the Book of Job asserts that Leviathan - adragon-like attendant of the Phaeton-like Rahab - \"maketh a path to shine afterhim\" 251 .Interestingly, in considering cosmic causes for certain mass extinctions ofterrestrial life in the past, Stothers concluded that: \"...the most importantperturbing objects must not only have a high mass density but must also beconcentrated strongly towards the galactic plane\" 252 . The Milky Way marks thegalactic plane, as viewed from Earth! Did Phaeton, therefore, emanate from thedirection of the galactic plane?Astronomical knowledge in the ancient Near East was thus clearly far moreadvanced than is commonly supposed, but although much of it was apparentlyderived from yet earlier but unknown sources, considerable confidence can beplaced in the veracity of even those records which depict additional worlds orplanets in the solar system. Does some amazing truth lie behind these apparentdiscrepancies, a truth which involved large scale planetary disturbances likethose suggested by our previous survey of the present solar system?16 War in Heavens-^fe-ji^fcisraNo names are given on the Mesopotamian cylinder-seals for the celestial bodiesdepicted on them, but the central rayed object is almost certainly the Sun andthe remaining bodies are planets. The absence of distinguish-ing names, however, inevitably makes planetary identifications debatable, eventhough it would be reasonable to assume that the larger images represent thelarger planets and the smaller images the smaller planets. We shallalso shortly see that, on cylinder-seal VA/243, they have been placed around therayed Sun in more or less correct orbital sequence (not distance). There is,however, one extra body, which, because it is not rayed, is presumably alsoplanetary.Various ancient Near Eastern cosmologies have come down to us, although often inrather fragmentary condition. Studies of them clearly show that all were basedon some original prototype which evidently incorporated not only surprisinglyadvanced concepts but, in simplified form, the idea of the evolution of worldsin much the same general way as astrophysicists do today. Of these cosmologies,the version favoured by the early. Mesopotamians is probably the best known andthe most completely studied. It is a veritable epic, and, in its latter stages,describes the Marduk/Tiamat confrontation. It is thus directly concerned withthe main theme of this book.Three variants of this cosmological saga exist, in which the names of theprincipal characters often vary or are occasionally interchangeable. Oldest ofthe three is the version inscribed on clay tablets dating from about 650 BC,found in Assurbanipal's palace library at Nineveh. The next was writtert byBerosus about 280 BC, and the third, bequeathed us by Damascius, dates from thesixth Christian century. As Berosus' and Damascius' accounts are unhelpful here,we quickly turn to the oldest version.The first studies made of the Nineveh tablets showed that they dealt with anAkkadian creation epic in many ways closely parallelling that given in Genesis.Accordingly, the first translation of it into English highlighted thissimilarity 253 , later studies merely reinforcing this point 2 ^. Most scholarshave come to regard the epic as a philosophical work emphasising the eternalstruggle between good (light) and evil (darkness), or as an allegorical story ofNature's alternating summer and winter; yet, in view of current astronomicalknowledge, it is comparatively easy to 'read between the lines', and reconstructfrom the epic's text the outlines of what can only have been a monumental war inheaven. Indeed, in this connection, one cannot help but agree with Farnell who,in 1919, correctly observed:What is quite normal in nature and society rarely excites the myth-makingimagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the abnormal, some startlingcatastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code. 2 \"The Marduk/Tiamat confrontation combined all those deviations from the norm.The epic, of which Prof Leonard King's translation is used here, and in whichimmense periods of time are truncated and telescoped, begins with a picture ofthe primeval universe. It then continues with an account of what may be regardedas the evolution of the planets (called 'gods' in the epic) and some of thesatellites comprising the solar system. Together with the Sun, these bodies areawarded distinctive names in the Akkadian text, which, because we willrepeatedly refer to them in the following paragraphs, are listed below withtheir modern counterparts.Table 4B. Suggested identification of objects on Babylonian cylinder-sealThe above list suggests the probable identities (Akkadian and modern) of thecelestial objects featured on the aforementioned cylinder-seal in the EastBerlin State Museum. The seal apparently shows the planets in more or less theircorrect order, in an anti-clockwise direction (that in which they naturallyorbit the Sun) commencing with Mercury. The large relative size of the bodyidentified as Tiamat is interesting. It suggests that Tiamat physicallyresembled Jupiter and Saturn more than any of the inner planets. With thatpossibility in mind, it follows that Tiamat probably possessed a deep atmospherenot very dissimilar from?

Suggested identification of objects on Babylonian cylinder-seal.Tiamat, the lost planet, is shown shaded.Some translations give Gaga as Kakka 23 .those of the two giant planets just named, and in which methane, ammonia andvarious ices were comparatively prominent. We shall later find these to beparticularly significant points. Ovenden has even suggested that its minimumconfiguration (distance from the Sun) relative to Earth (1.00) and Jupiter(5.20), was 2.79 258 , and Van Flandern that its mass may have been 90 timesthat of Earth 259 . Opik has also speculated about this missing planet 260 .At this juncture we must note that the Akkadian epic makes no mention of Earthor the Moon, although Babylonian astronomers knew the planetary nature of thesebodies, and apparently included them on the cylinder-seal diagram, calling themKi and Sin respectively. Throughout most of this epic, Earth is thus conceivedof, somewhat curiously, as a kind of unaffected off-stage vantage point fromwhich the celestial dramas were merely observed and recorded.No mention is made in the epic of how long peace reigned in the solar systembefore it was shattered by the arrival of a new 'god', Marduk, although we knowfrom other evidence that Marduk (alias Phaeton) rampaged near Earth only some11,500 years ago, when all the planets were still present in the solar system,orbiting the Sun on regular paths. But, as we shall now see, Marduk's arrivaldisrupted this order, and this remarkable epic, from this point onwards, tracesthe resultant havoc among the planets step by step.The epic states:In the Chamber of Fates, the place ofDestinies, A god was engendered, most able andivisest of gods; In the heart of the Deep was Mardukcreated 324 .The 'heart of the deep' apparently signifies cosmic space beyond the confines ofthe solar system. Marduk originated there and was, therefore, alien to the solarsystem. As it neared the system, Marduk began to be attracted by the outermostsizable planet, Ea (Neptune), who could, therefore, be said to have 'begot him'.Marduk's origins are never made very clear, although several early sourcesprovide a variety of scrappy and unhelpful hints that he was born in Aruru,Dauce or E/ 261 . Be that as it may, Marduk was a spectacular sight.Alluring was his figure, sparkling the liftof his eyes; Lordly was his gait, commanding as ofolden times... Greatly exalted was he above the gods,exceeding throughout... His members were enormous, he wasexceeding tall... Wlien he moved his lips fire blazed forth.That Marduk was evidently visible from Earth during its initial 'adventures'among the furthest members of the Sun's family again indicates that it was not acomet. Even the brightest comets recorded in astronomical archives are notvisible to the unaided eye when traversing the outer limits of the solarsystem. Yet Marduk is described unambiguously as a huge and radiant visitor frommore distant (interstellar) regions, from time to time spewing great jets offire. We may again emphasise that no comet observed in the outer confines of thesolar system has yet been observed to eject great streams of fire like thosejust mentioned, since by their very nature comets are not actually fiery. Mardukwas thus definitely some other kind of celestial visitor.Of particular interest in the epic is a passage which relates how, after Mardukhad entered the solar system, the planets \"...heaped upon him their awesomeflashes\" making him shine with dazzling brilliance 325 as he became \"clothedwith the halo of ten gods\". In other words, Marduk grew markedly brighter, sobright that the ancients considered him second only to the Sun in heavenlybrilliance, and, as amongst the Greeks, dubbed him the 'son' of the Sun {Sol orHelios). Clearly something happened to Marduk when far out at the edge of thesolar system, something that has never been associated with even the largestknown comets.It would not be unreasonable to account for Marduk's increased effulgence andtherefore apparent size by postulating that the planetary 'flashes' 'heaped uponhim' were immense thermoelectric (and probably electromagnetic) dischargesdirected at him by the outer planets whose own electromagnetic fields were bythen beginning to react to Marduk's arrival. Yet such effects may have been apart only of what perhaps really happened, and masked what may have been a stillmore startling scenario.So far the evidence is inconclusive that the Kuiper Belt objects genuinelyrepresent the assorted remnants of some sizable bygone planetary body.Nevertheless, these remnants do occur astronomically close to a geologicallyvery young Aluminium-26 cloud said to be typical of those associated withsupernova explosions. Instead of attributing Marduk's increased brilliancysolely to colossal exchanges of energy between Marduk and the outer planets,however, it should be borne in mind that virtually the same effect could havearisen if Marduk had catastrophically ruptured the remote plane now possiblyrepresented by the Kuiper Belt objects. Theresultant explosion would have been enormous and, even from distant Earth,spectacular but soundless. To terrestrial observers, who would scarcely havebeen able to have actually seen the planet involved, it would have seemed asthough Marduk had simply grown in size and brilliance, to become in that respectan apparent rival to the Sun - something no comet has ever been credited withachieving.The explosion itself, assuming that one really took place, must have resultedfrom either a physical collision between Marduk and the disrupted planet, orfrom a concomitant destruction of part of Marduk's 'stellar' substance. This, orsome closely similar scenario, must have been the source of the Aluminium-26cloud.There is, of course, no question of any supernova event occurring on the outeredge of the solar system. Had one erupted - at any point in geological history -it would have totally incinerated the solar system, the Sun probably being thelone survivor of such an event. Instead, something infinitely smaller (thoughstill huge by Earthly standards) occurred beyond Pluto to create theAluminium-26 cloud, something which had to have partly involved 'stellar'matter.The inherent violence of such an explosion naturally flung dismantled pieces ofthe destroyed planet in all directions, and it is possible to interpret theeccentrically orbiting object 1992 QB, possibly the unknown large body whichbelievedly altered Uranus' speed in 1897 and, perhaps, Pholus and Pluto'ssatellite Charon as some of the larger relics of the now-lost planet. Such aconcept would also account for Pluto's own highly eccentric orbit.After entering the solar system, Marduk first encountered Ea (Neptune), thegravitational field of which was sufficient to determine Marduk's future course,\"making it good for its purpose\". Neptune's gravitational pull was also powerfulenough to cause Marduk to grow a second 'head', an indication of Marduk'smolten, plastic, condition.As Marduk reaches Anu (Uranus), however, great pieces of him are torn off andform into four attendants which commence to circle around Marduk \"swirling as awhirlwind\". Again, no cometary body has been observed toproduce revolving satellitic objects; only an object possessing appreciable masscould have established and maintained such a situation. As previously noted,conventional comets lack mass of any consequence, (see also Note 5)Also of interest is Marduk's direction of flight. Its passing of first Neptuneand then Uranus strongly suggests that Marduk's flight-path was contrary to thatof the planets, a factor which, in the case of a large and apparentlyhighly-charged visitor like Marduk, must have been very disruptive for smallerbodies encountered en route. Could this, for example, be the reason why thesmall planet Pluto and Neptune's two satellites (Triton and Nereid) orbit sostrangely? It will be recalled from Part Three that Ovid stated that Phaetonflew among the planets the 'wrong way'.Marduk then passes Anshar (Saturn), so perhaps it is no coincidence that thisplanet, together with Anu (Uranus) and Ea (Neptune), rotates at a surprisinglyfast speed, that Saturn's satellite Phoebe has a retrograde orbit, and thatUranus (Anu), which was responsible for distorting Marduk and detaching four'satellites' from it, now rotates on an axis uniquely tilted NNW-SSE.Marduk apparently became trapped by the gravitational fields of the three largeouter planets for some appreciable time. This also began to affect the orbit ofTiamat and its satellite Kingu, with the former adopting an erratic orbitalpath, and the latter being pulled free of Tiamat's gravitational attraction andacquiring a \"Tablet of Destiny\".At this point, Kishar, Anshar, Anu, and Ea asked themselves by what right Tiamathad to elevate Kingu to the status of a god - one who orbited freely (the Tabletof Destiny). Anshar (Saturn) asked first Ea (Neptune) and then Anu (Uranus) toslay Kingu, but neither could do so, whereupon Anshar conceived the idea thatthis could be achieved by the approaching Marduk, an idea eagerly agreed to bythe other gods. Thus we find Marduk, approaching close to Saturn (\"kissed thelips of Anshar\"), agreeing to undertake this task. Anshar then instructed hisemissary, Gaga (Chiron), to:Be on thy way Gaga,Take the stand before the gods,seemingly a clear reference to Marduk pulling Chiron free of the gravitationalfield of Saturn and causing it henceforth to move in free orbit. The presence ofsuch a small planet orbiting among the giant outer planets is one of theanomalies of the solar system, and could well be accounted for by the scenariounfolding before us.Marduk plunged on and began to approach glistening 326 and brilliant 127 Tiamat:He produced streatns, disturbed Tiamat; The gods were not at rest, carried as ina stream.Tiamat is described as having \"paced about distraught\" as Marduk also affectedthe inner planets and \"diluted their vitals... pinched their eyes\". Such phrasesconvey a scene in which the powerfully-charged Marduk, a molten fiery object,emitted vast electromagnetic charges that, as well as causing Tiamat to orbiterratically, affected the equivalent fields of Tiamat and the inner planets. Inthis connection, could it be significant that for some while before the onset ofthe Phaeton disaster, increased heat and a terrible drought was allegedlyexperienced on Earth?Encouraged by Marduk's willingness to destroy Kingu, the gods then exhort Mardukto go a step further and \"cut off the life of Tiamat\" as well. In the epic,Marduk agrees to do this on one condition, with the words:If I, as your AvengerAm to vanquish Tiamat, save your lives -Convene an Assembly to proclaim myDestiny supreme.This passage seemingly relates to the stage when Marduk, having apparentlyalready approached near enough to Tiamat to derange its orbit and detach itssatellite ('first-born') Kingu, found itself still struggling in the grip of thecombined gravitational fields of the outer planets which, in the guise of gods,were anxious to be rid of him. Eventually they ejected Marduk from their sphereof gravitational influence straight towards Tiamat with 'destiny supreme'.The epic then tells how, deranged by Marduk, Tiamat began to break-up; from hermidst, there emerged eleven \"monsters\", styled elsewhere as \"eleven mightyhelpers\", which \"separated themselves\" from her body and \"growling, raging...marched at the side of Tiamat\". Tiamat is said to have \"crowned them withhalos\". According to Babylonian texts, these \"helpers\" were armed withthunderbolts and included Lakhmu the shining snake, the Great Lion, the Viper,the Ravening Dog, the Scorpion Man, the Storm Winds, the Goat Fish, the Fish Manand Kingu 262 — Tiamat's \"first-born\" (satellite) -who commanded them. Amongthese names we quickly recognise the Midgard Serpent and the Fenris-Wolf of theNorse Eddas.The epic then describes how Marduk filled himself with \"blazing flame\" -increased in radiance - \"constructed a bow... attached thereto an arrow\", \"setlightning\" in front of him, and made \"a net to enfold Tiamat therein\". Thesephrases can only signify that Marduk developed a coma ('bow'), emitted flashes('lightning') and gave off electrical discharges all round ('net') as it coursedacross the heavens. It must have been an awesome and terrifying spectacle. Thefour whirling satellites ('winds') detached from him by Anu (Uranus) fly byMarduk's side, and to these he adds three more (pieces which break-off from him)called Evil Wind, Whirlwind and Matchless Wind. All head straight for Tiamat and\"her host\".The Lord went forth, followed his course; Towards the raging Tiamat he set hisface... The Lord approached to scan the innersideof Tiamat -The scheme ofKingtt, her consort, to perceive. As he looks on, hiscourse becomes upset, His direction is distracted, his doings areconfused. When the gods, his helpers, Who were marching at his side, Saw thevaliant Kingu, blurred becametheir vision.Marduk and his satellites were clearly deranged in flight as they neared Tiamatand Kingu, while the blurring of the satellites' 'vision' may refer to theblinding flashes of the electrical discharges that almost certainly must haveoccurred between all three bodiesthen. We have already noted how the electrical fields of closely approachinglarge bodies would try to equalise through repeated discharges of this kind.Celestial battle, however, was now joined.Tiamat and Marduk, the ivisest of the gods, Advanced against one another; Theypressed on to single combat, Tliey approached for battle.Marduk \"raised the flooding storm, his mighty weapon\" (an electromagnetic stormof unimaginable violence?). \"Tiamat emitted a roar\" and, as her \"fury\" grew,\"the roots of her legs shook back and forth\" (Tiamat's magnetic poles repeatedlyreversed with -surprisingly for earthly viewers - thunderous acoustics as theplanet's structure endured appalling strain). Marduk then:...spread out his net to enfold her;The Evil Wind, the rearmost, he unleashedat her face. As she opened her mouth, Tiamat, todevour him -He drove the Evil Wind so that she closednot her lips. The fierce storm Winds then charged herbelly; Her body became distended; her mouth hadopened wide. He shot there through an arrow, it tore herbelly; It cut through her insides, tore into herwomb.Having thus subdued her, her life-breath he extinguished.In this remarkable passage, we literally read of the terrible destruction of aplanet. At this point we must assume from the foregoing passage and from itsalleged position in the solar system that Tiamat was a fairly large planetpossessing a lithosphere like that of Earth. After unleashing his 'floodingstorm', Marduk then enveloped Tiamat in constant electrical discharges ('net')which so disrupted the planet's electrical mechanism that Tiamat's rotation wasretarded or braked to a halt. This resulted in the planet's outer shellor crust splitting open (\"opened her mouth\"). While this crack was still open(\"closed not her lips\"), Marduk poured further electromagnetic charges(\"fierce... winds\") into it (\"charged her belly\"), so that \"her body becamedistended\" (internal magmatic material continued to rotate, causing theremaining portions of Tiamat's crust to bulge and /or sag locally). This, inturn, caused the crack to gape ever more widely (\"her mouth had opened wide\"),and it faced directly at Marduk as Tiamat \"opened her mouth... to devour him\"."},{"pageContent":"Some bolt (\"arrow\") of electricity or similar matter was then shot by Mardukinto this crustal aperture which \"tore her belly... cut through her insides\"(magmatic interior) and \"tore into her womb\" (penetrated to the planet's core).This was tantamount to a gigantic electrical 'short-out' between the twointernal dynamos of the respective antagonists, and must have resulted in one oftwo things: either Tiamat's entire natural electromagnetic field wasneutralised, this being drawn off and absorbed by Marduk, or Tiamat broke-up.That Tiamat seemingly suffered the latter fate is suggested by the followingpassage, in which Marduk:To divide the monster he then artfullyplanned. Then, as a mussel, he split her into hvo parts. Tlie Lord trod uponTiamat's hinder part; With his weapon the connected skull hecut loose; He severed the channels of her blood; And caused the North Wind tobear it To places that have been unknown. The half of her he set up as a screenfor theskies; Locking them together, as watchmen hestationed them... He bent Tiamat's tail to form the GreatBand as a bracelet.Tiamat's split crust still hung partially connected, any surviving remnants ofthe stricken planet's atmosphere, liquids, ices and gases, no doubt smoking andsteaming as a result of the immense heat generated throughout Tiamat's structureby Marduk's onslaught. With his weapon (electromagnetic), Marduk then dis-membered the planet completely, one half of which, presumably the upper, beingtermed Tiamat's skull. The \"channels of her blood\" were severed (Tiamat's polaraxis no longer existed), whereby the \"skull\" portion of the planet - which mayhave carried an ice-cap -floated freely apart from the rest of the savagedworld.Marduk then appears to have demolished one of these halves, which, becauseMarduk was still moving sunwards and dragging the remains of Tiamat along withit, formed a \"tail\" of debris which streamed out behind it. The epic tells howMarduk placed these fragments in the heavens as a \"screen\", a \"bracelet\", a\"Great Band\". Today this may represent either the asteroid belt, which consistsmostly of related groups of objects, or the recently discovered circumsolar dustring (see Appendix C). The scholarly Jewish translation of the Holy Scripturesaccording to masoretic texts, The Torah, also refers to this, alluding to Marduksimply as 'the Lord':The Heavens bespeak the glory of the Lord, The Hammered Bracelet proclaims hishandiwork... 263 .and very significantly adds: \"From the end of heaven he emanates\" 1M . We havealready noted that the Babylonian epic states that Marduk came from the 'GreatDeep' ('end of heaven').Meanwhile, the apparently undemolished portion of Tiamat was carried by Marduktowards the Sun and the inner planets. But what of Tiamat's 'helpers'? The epicrelates how, after the destruction of Tiamat:Her band was shattered, her host broken up. Tlie gods, her helpers who marchedat herside, Trembling with fear, Turned their backs about so as to save andpreserve their lives.Marduk, however, caused them to be \"thrown into a net\" (to be capturedgravita-tionally - the combined gravitational fields of Marduk and the remainingpart of Tiamat must have been appreciable):...They found themselves ensnared...The whole band of demons that hadmarched on her side He cast into fetters, their hands he bound... Tightlycircled, they could not escape.Furthermore, Marduk removed the \"Tablet of Destiny\" from Kingu's breast andattached it to his own - another reference to Kingu being reduced to asatellite, this time of Marduk. The gravitational field of Marduk thus continuedto be enhanced.Tiamat was no more. If early humanity had ever gazed at Tiamat as a distantplanet circling the heavens (as the Babylonian epic clearly implies that theydid), they could no longer locate it. It had disappeared. Interestingly, theancient Greeks also speak of a time of celestial strife between the gods Ares(Mars) and Athene (Venus) when a planet, Electra by name and one of sevensisters, allsired by Atlas - and no longer able to watch the conflict - departed from theheavens never to be seen again 265 .In Part Three we found Plato's account of the loss of the legendary continent ofAtlantis (the empire of Atlas) to be but one recollection of the occurrence ofradical worldwide topographical changes some 11,500 years ago initiated bypowerful and violent celestial agents.So were Electra and Tiamat simply different titles of the same lost (destroyed)planet? Did Tiamat, like Electra, perish at a time when the planets Ares (Mars)and Athene (Venus) were also disturbed? Indeed, was their derangement merelypart and parcel of the same cosmic drama which, in causing a vast conflagration,a tremendous flood, and major tectonic upheavals here on Earth, affected theentire solar system?17Phaeton's WrathC%i^2fe-r4i?£r\"»So far as our theme is concerned, the Babylonian epic finishes with thesubjugation of Tiamat's attendants by the fiery Marduk. The epic has outlined anextraordinary celestial event in which the solar system was visited by adangerous assailant from more distant cosmic regions, which thereupon wanderederratically among the planets in a sunwards direction, generating havoc as itdid so. None of the described planetary reactions basically infringe knownastronomical laws, although the account of the destruction of Tiamat iscertainly startling. In 1950, however, Velikovsky - who hardly did more thanacknowledge the existence of the Tiamat/Marduk epic - argued that the planetVenus was originally a comet which had been ejected from the giant planetJupiter during the second millennium BC, and that, aftererratic wanderings among the inner planets Mars and Earth, it eventually settleddown as a candescent 'hot' object into its present near-circular orbit round theSun 266 . Unlike the Babylonian epic, Velikovsky's hypothesis - at which mostastronomers voiced incredulity -required Mars to leave its previous stable orbitand to approach closely both Earth and the then still errant Venus on severaloccasions during the eighth century BC, a requirement necessitating a violationof the accepted laws concerning the motions of large celestial bodies 267 .Recent studies of Venus, however, show the planet to possess a bulk andcomposition very unlike that of Jupiter, so much so that there is absolutely nolikelihood of it ever having issued from the giant planet 268 . For example, intable 4A (Planetary Statistics), we saw thatJupiter's density is only 1.3g/cm ~* and that Venus' is 5.1g/cm \\ or similar tothat of Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere is dominated chemically by hydrogen and itsmost abundant simple compounds - methane and ammonia, as well as water. Recentlysome higher hydrocarbons have also been detected in it 269 . In contrast, theVenusian atmosphere is oxidised 270 . Direct sampling by the Venera series ofatmospheric probes disclosed that Venus' atmosphere consists almost entirely ofcarbon dioxide, with small quantities of nitrogen, argon, water and hydrochloricand hydrofluoric acids 271 ; while analyses of infrared reflection spectra ofVenusian clouds showed beyond all reasonable doubt that the visible clouds inthe upper atmosphere of Venus are composed of sulphuric acid droplets 272 .Earlier announcements that the Mariner 2 space probe had detected hydrocarbonsin the Venusian atmosphere were spurious and should be ignored 273 .Measurements taken by the Mariner 10 flyby of Venus highlighted another reasonwhy the planet cannot have emanated from Jupiter, for they showed that:...the total energy radiated by Venus is equivalent to that from a black body ofabout 230°K, or just what one would expect in the absence of any internalsource. Thus there is no evidence that Venus radiates more energy than itreceives from the Sun 274 .The possibility that Venus may have cooled from a candescent (1,100°C) state toits present much lower temperature during the thirty-five centuries or so since,according to Velikovsky, it ceased to be a marauding comet, has been ablyinvestigated by Morrison 275 and others, who found that there exist noscientific grounds for supposing this to have occurred. In conclusion,therefore, no demonstrable evidence exists that it was ever a comet or has everseriously departed from its present orbit. Nevertheless, numerous referencesoccur in the ancient writings of the Hindus, Persians, Babylonians, Chinese,Mexicans and others averting to a time when Venus apparently battled in the skyagainst Mars. Much of Velik-ovsky's argument respecting the alleged formerderangement of the Martian and Venusianorbits relied on these references. Thus, if modern astronomy conclusivelydemonstrates that Venus cannot have been a comet, then either these ancientassertions are somehow factually correct or they really allude to one or moreother celestial objects which, in later days, were erroneously confused byscribes, redactors and commentators with Mars and Venus.In view of all the foregoing, it is exceedingly difficult to see how theseancient, and in many cases quite independent writings can be factually correct,and everything points to the second alternative as being the most likely.Indeed, we shall shortly find this to have almost certainly been the case.Firstly, however, we must take a closer look at Mars.Table 4A shows that Mars takes slightly over 24 hours to rotate. Ideally itshould take only 8 hours. This comparatively slow rotation is somehow connectedwith a past change in the planet's rotational equilibrium figure. In turn, thisappears to have caused extensive fracturing of the Martian crust, and areduction of the theoretical norm of the Martian magnetic field. We have alsonoted that Mars follows a decidedly eccentric orbit. Astronomers have admittedthat the known observational data fails to satisfactorily explain theseanomalies and that something quite profound has happened to Mars in the not sodistant past.This Martian fracture complex is especially noteworthy for resembling theequivalent lineament system characterising the terrestrial crust. This latter,which some have categorically stated was producible only by external rather thanlocal agencies, resulted from massive crus-tal dislocations seemingly coincidentwith magnetic reversals, widespread orogeny, vulcanism, flooding and biologicalextinctions approximately 11,500 years ago, and for all of which a celestialinitiation has been repeatedly advocated.Can it be coincidence, therefore, that: the Babylonian epic describes how Marduksimilarly split Tiamat's outer shell; that the Martian crustal fracturesresemble Earth's; that a planet (Electra) allegedly disappeared at a time whenMars and Venus are said to have fought in heaven; and that when, on Earth,immense changes engendered by Phaeton (alias Marduk) occurred to topographicalfeatures ever associated with Electra's mythologi-cal father Atlas (eg, Atlas mountains, Straits of Gibraltar, and Atlantis)?Surely these similarities are too close to be products of totally separateevents, for all are seemingly united by the insistent underlying theme of apowerful and destructive cosmic assailant.If, therefore, neither Mars nor Venus can have strayed sufficiently far fromtheir usual orbits to have engaged in 'celestial combat', early Man, who watchedbut misidentified the contestants, must have observed some other sizable objectbecome embroiled in 'heavenly strife' with Mars. In one account from the thirdcentury BC, Mars is pursued and attacked while apparently still on its normalorbit:...the star of Mars... was pursued by the star Venus; then Venus took hold ofhim and inflamed him with ardent passion. 276Something bright and star-like caught up with Mars as it travelled along itssolar orbit and, having done so, began to heat it up ('inflamed him') just asTiamat had been previously. Was this star-like body Marduk wending its waysunwards? We submit that it was. So, if any significance can be attached to theold Persian description of the \"bright and glorious Tistrya\" as the \"star thatattacks planets\" 277 , we see that the Venus which allegedly inflamed Mars''passions' was none other than Marduk (alias Phaeton). Enhanced radiance due tothermal energy (heat) may well have made Mars appear starlike (flashing) orsun-like (fiery) to Earthbound observers. Much of significance may underlie thefollowing statement in a Chinese chronicle describing an abnormal celestialevent said to have occurred in the reign of Emperor Kwei (Koei-Kie):At this time the two suns were seen to battle in the sky. The five planets wereagitated by unusual movements. A part of Mount T'ai-chan fell down 278 .In the Indo-Lranian Zend-Avesta, these planets: \"...ran against the sky andcreated confusion\" 279 , and: \"...The celestial sphere was in revolution... Theplanets, with many demons, dashed against the celestial sphere and mixed theconstellations..\" 280 . These 'demons' were pre-sumably the debris of Tiamat and her 'helpers' still accompanying Marduk at thattime.The ancient Chinese expressly associated these cosmic dramas with vastterrestrial floods, for they believed that \"...if the five planets err on theirroutes\", the land will be engulfed by a great flood 281 . This belief isunquestionably a memory of the Deluge occurring at the time of Phaeton's visit.The Aztecs of pre-Columbian Mexico referred to Mars, which they calledHuitzilopochtlr 82 , as being \"...like live-fire, greatly feared by hisenemies...\" 283 . They also revered a hero-god called Quetzalcoatl, \"thefeathered serpent\", the priest of whose cult, in one of the Aztec ceremonies,shot an arrow into an effigy of HuitziJopochtli, who was then considered to bedead 284 . Does this not recall Marduk firing the fatal 'arrow' (discharge) intoTiamat? And is it not a little curious that the Aztecs always conceivedQuetzalcoatl as a serpent, albeit a feathered one? Could it be that Marduk(alias Quetzalcoatl) discharged a similar 'arrow' at Mars when those two bodiesneared one another? Classical Greek texts indicate that this almost certainlyoccurred.Homer's famous Iliad 185 , though primarily concerned with the equally famousTrojan war, contains a lengthy account of a celestial battle between the deitiesAres and Pallas-Athene, and in which Aphrodite (goddess of the Moon) and Hera(goddess of the Earth) also become involved. Ares, of course, is Mars, andPallas-Athene (Velikovsky's Venus) is Marduk. Homer makes Ares patron of theTrojans and Pallas-Athene protectress of the Greeks; but this was clearly aliterary device. The confrontation between these two entities was originally aseparate and much older interplanetary event.That this is the correct interpretation is seemingly confirmed by the fact that,in the so-called Homeric hymns 28 \", Ares is called a planet, whereasPallas-Athene is not, even though various earlier commentators have assumed thatit must have been. The somewhat nebulous but nevertheless discernibledistinction in the Homeric hymns is actually consistent with the description ofIshtar - the Babylonian name for Pallas-Athene - as 'the fearful dragon'inscribed on tablets retrieved from Assur-banipal's ruined library at Nineveh287 .picture56 [images/picture56.jpg]PHAETON/MARDUK O Spews fire a PP roachin 9 the ^ Solar System/Pluto^^NEPTUNESg^ 0 'x Pieces torn off Marduk here URANUS -•'^ Equatorial alignment changed, moonsderangedFig 4.13. Schematic diagram of the path apparently taken by Phaeton/Mardukthrough the solar system. Not to scale.Based on the Sumerian texts and recent astronomical data discussed on precedingpages, and on the main effectsattributable to its passage. Orbital positions of the planets approximatelycorrect only at the times whenPhaeton/Marduk reached their individual vicinities.Paraphrasing Homer's account we find that Pallas-Athene first of all removesAres from the field of battle (perturbs Mars' orbit), only for both entities tomeet again - this time \"furious Ares abiding on the left of the battle\" (Mardukevidently passes round behind Mars and crosses inside Mars' orbit). This isconsistent with the aforementioned 'pursuit' in Eratosthenes' account. At thisstage, Aphrodite (the Moon) tries to enter the fray (the Moon affectedgravi-tationally?). Ares then darkens the battlefield (the Martian atmospherebecomes disturbed?) and Pallas-Athene is seen to retreat (Marduk moves away fromMars). Hera, the goddess of Earth then complains at this celestial turmoil(Earth is affected electromagnefically?).Pallas-Athene then turns on Ares and hurls a \"spear\" (discharge) \"mightilyagainst his nethermost belly\" (this instantly reminds us of the \"fierce stormwinds\" Marduk discharged at Tiamat's \"belly\"). Ares emits a \"loud bellow\"(thunderous roar) and Pallas-Athene a great cry (another roar) as \"over againsther spouted Ares, dread as a dark whirlwind\" (innumerable lightning boltsdischarged by Mars makes the planet appear to spout), and \"together then theyclashed with a mighty din...\". At this juncture, Hera spread a thick mist aboutherself (though yet millions of miles distant, various physical effects of theconflict begin to be felt on Earth).Ares strikes Pallas-Athene with his long \"spear\" (more electrical discharges),but although the latter \"gave ground\" (retreated), it retaliates by heaving agigantic stone, \"black and jagged and great\" (the remaining portion of the deadTiamat?), at Ares and thereby \"loosed his limbs\" (caused Mars to become unsteady- to oscillate). Simultaneously \"round about Great Heaven pealed as with atrumpet\". Aphrodite then came to Ares' assistance, whose \"hand\" she took and\"sought to lead away\" (lunar gravitational pull caused Mars to move further awayfrom Marduk); but Pallas-Athene \"sped in pursuit and smote Aphrodite on thebreast... and her heart melted\" (Marduk discharged an electromagnetic bolt atthe Moon, which had the effect of causing the Moon to either move back towardsthe Earth or of nullifying its gravitational influence, or both).As the battle, in which Marduk appears to have failed to overcome Mars, seems tohave effectively come to an end at this juncture, it may be surmised that, inpursuing Aphrodite and smiting her on the breast, Marduk was now clear of Mars'immediate gravitational pull and was ominously heading towards the Earth/Moonsystem.Several questions arise at this point. For example, did the remnant of Tiamathurled by Marduk at Mars (if that is what the \"black and jagged and great\" stonereally was) disintegrate amid tremendous din in Mars' Roche Limit? In itsdismembered condition, this remnant would have been structurally weak with nocontrollable gravitational or magnetic field of its own, yet would still havepossessed inherently destructive mass. It is, perhaps, highly significant thatMars is orbited today by two irregularly shaped (\"jagged\") satellites which, bycommon consensus, are peculiar objects from every point of view. Are theyfragments of Tiamat acquired from Marduk? Tolson has already suggested this withregard to Phobos 288 .The two irregularly-shaped Martian moons, therefore, could indeed be capturedfragments of the unfortunate Tiamat, while the aforementioned slow rotation ofMars, its unaccountably reduced magnetic field, its distorted orbit, theinferred past changes to its rotational equilibrium figure, and its crustalfracture complex, could well have resulted from its alleged encounter withPallas-Athene (Marduk/ Phaeton) and from an actual or near collision with the\"black and jagged and great\" stone (a remnant of Tiamat?). Roche's Limit wouldhave ensured the inevitable break-up of that object.Briefly, the Roche Limit is the zone which surrounds any large object ofappreciable mass possessing a gravitational field, at a distance of 2 to 3 radiiof the object concerned. In effect it is a danger-zone, and any object with asmaller mass or weaker gravitational field entering it will be either swiftlyexpelled from it electromagnetically, or, more commonly, be subjected tointolerable tidal stress and disintegrated. Disintegration is practicallyguaranteed if the smaller object remains within the zone indefinitely, but lessso if it rapidly passes through only a limited area of the zone at high speed.It is also more than probable that the disintegration of a large body (say, onethe size of the Moon) would involve an explosion at some relatively early stage,with consequent high-velocity dispersal in literally all directions of theresultant debris. The blast occasioned by a sufficiently large explosion would,no doubt, extensively modify any atmosphere enveloping the larger host object,could alter its composition, and might even lead to permanent dissipation andattenuation of a sizable percentage of it. This, in turn, could alter theplanet's thermal balance, and induce new climatic regimes. These, or closelysimilar effects, appear to have been experienced by Mars. Or are they capturedasteroids?Discussing the Velikovskian notion of former celestial confrontations betweenEarth, Mars, and Venus, relative to the problem of disposal of planetary energy,Rose and Vaughan concluded that:The participation of at least one other body besides Venus, Earth and Mars inthe encounters that have occurred since Venus' final departure from the vicinityof Jupiter could provide a easy solution to this energy-disposal problem. 289This is a most interesting statement, for, although we do not accept that Venuswas ever ejected from Jupiter (as Rose and Vaughan believed), the object thatthey, and Velikovsky, called Venus appears to have indeed been present in thecelestial encounters they discuss. It was Phaeton. Very pertinently, Rose andVaughan added:...if we permit this 'other body' to interact with Mars... then the problem of(orbital) eccentricity-damping will evaporate as well. 290As the probable sequence of the physical changes sustained by Earth during thePhaeton disaster are discussed in Part Five of this book, those details can betemporarily side-stepped here, and we pick up the saga of this 'war in heaven'at the point where Phaeton vacates the environs of Earth.Upon leaving the vicinity of Earth, Phaeton apparently headed sunwards oncemore, for vague human memories have come down to us of a great 'dragon' or fiery'monster' coursing across the heavens towards the Sun just after the Deluge.Evidently brief glimpses of it were afforded isolated Deluge survivors throughoccasional gaps in the deranged and rapidly thickening atmosphere (the'collapsed sky'). Thereafter, the gloom persisting for decades afterwards, thecollapsed sky undoubtedly curtailed observations of this celestial spectacle.Very little was seen of what happened to Phaeton as it neared Venus or crossedits orbit on its sunward journey. Nevertheless, various post-diluvian beliefsand ancient astronomical texts suggest the outlines of what apparently occurred.Accordingly, we now examine these.The worship of Venus as either the Morning Star or the Evening Star wasextremely widespread in post-diluvian times, and many pro-pitiary cults to Venusexisted among numerous classical and pre-classical civilisations in bothhemispheres. Clearly some deep significance underlay these beliefs and wasseemingly due to the fact that, when Venus becomes the Morning or Evening Star,it can become the brightest object after the Sun. As a result of its increasingbrilliance at those times, it may have instantly reminded catastrophe survivorsof the steadily increasing brilliance of the fiery Phaeton in the weeks when itapproached ever nearer to Earth.If so, this suggests that, before the Phaeton disaster, Venus shone lessbrilliantly and was seasonally a less conspicuous object. This, in turn, mightindicate that the albedo (reflectivity) of the Venusian atmosphere had beenenhanced during the intervening period and that its orbital motion may havechanged.That something rather unusual has indeed happened to Venus may be inferred fromthe relevant statistics noted in table 4A. Compared with nearly all those forother planets in the solar system, these reflect decidedly aberrant motions.Could a near-collision with a sizable celestial object, such as Phaeton, haveproduced such anomalies? Theoretically at least, the answer is yes. It is, ofcourse, unscientific to assert categorically that Phaeton caused theseanomalies.Nevertheless, it is germane that ancient Persian texts declare thatMievish-Muspar, a fiery object, \"provided with tails\" and which had assaultedEarth long ago, had been \"attached\" by the Sun: \"...to its own radiance bymutual agreement, so that he (Muspar) may be less able to do harm\" 2 \".In other words, Muspar - alias Phaeton -had eventually plunged into and beenabsorbed by the Sun. Its journey towards the Sun must, therefore, have carriedit past Venus or across its orbit, whereby the likelihood of Venus acquiringanomalous motions then is a distinct possibility. Any such encounter, however,would have been largely invisible to Deluge survivors who for months could seenothing through the impenetrable gloom of the 'collapsed sky'.It was only with the dissipation of this thick cloud cover that Venus, nowperhaps on a newly-inclined orbit and possibly still trailing wisps or portionsof its own disturbed atmosphere (likened in ancient texts to 'hair', 'tails','horns', etc), became conspicuous in the clearing terrestrial heavens. Itssurprising brilliance and unexpected appearance at the time perhaps naturallyled confused and terrified Deluge survivors to suppose that Venus was thevanished Phaeton, and that its possible return was something to be avoided atall costs. The Venus cults of antiquity probably arose then.18 Phaeton's Significance*~vr'gfe->-t £? > ^r\"*We have repeatedly seen that, during its devastating progress through the solarsystem, Phaeton was apparently attracted to nearly all the planets in turn.Jupiter and Mercury seem to have been the exceptions. Conceivably these were inthe 'wrong part' of the solar system at the time, that is, they were orbitingthe far side of the Sun relative to Phaeton's course. Phaeton's predilection forplanets strongly suggests that it possessed an abnormally intenseelectromagnetic field which was naturally attracted to the equivalent fields ofthe planets it encountered and disturbed.Eventually, the overwhelmingly greater electromagnetic and gravitational fieldsof the Sun pulled it unerringly to a fiery grave in the solar furnace. Phaeton'simpact upon the enormously larger Sun would, of course, have been negligible.It is possible, therefore, to conceive of Phaeton pursuing a meandering coursethrough the solar system as it moved sun-wards from planet to planet, resulting in a pin-ball effect. Phaeton alsoapparently entered the solar system from a direction opposite to that in whichall the planets orbit the Sun. As mentioned before, old Persian texts expresslystate that Tistrya, the \"leader of the stars against the planets\", proceeded\"along his winding course\" 2 \" 2 (our italics), a point mentioned in severalancient texts and traditions. Fig 4.13 conveys this concept dia-grammatically.With the demise of Phaeton, the 'war in heaven' was effectively over, althoughinnumerable examples of the wreckage it produced throughout the solar system areyet traceable and many legacies of the phase which involved Earth are stillbeing experienced today.Despite its awesome destructive powers, however, the disaster was essentially asolitary event punctuating the uniformitarian normality of the solar system andwhich, among other effects, terminated a long andidyllic terrestrial regime anciently remembered as a 'Golden Age'. This had beenan excellent expression of Lyellian uniformity on Earth. Now it was shatteredand gone. Long aeons would and are to pass before such conditions become generalonce more.Incomplete, dim and scattered though they now are, the aforementioned legendsand traditions and the abundant geophysical and biological evidences relating tothe Phaetondisaster represent, of course, mere highlights of that appalling event - andessentially localised ones at that. They scarcely convey the full enormity ofthe overall catastrophe and seldom the actual order in which the constituentcalamities occurred. Insofar as this is possible, an attempt will therefore nowbe made to trace the probable sequence of these, their consequences at the time,and their subsequent longer-term effects.REFERENCES1.

Luxuriant vegetation, clothing extensive tractsin all hemispheres, was home to a fauna infinitely richer and more abundant thanthat of today.Also noted was the fact that such a regime could have existed only if Earthrotated more perpendicularly and, as emphasised in Part Five:4 on EarthFracture, appreciably slower than today. Days must have been correspondinglylonger virtually all the year round, and the seasons mainly undifferentiatedclimatically, especially in tropical and subtropical latitudes. Theoretically atleast, the result would have been 'uniformitarian' conditions like thosetraditionally ascribed to the legendary 'Golden Age' alluded to earlier.But the evolution and maintenance of such conditions necessarily involvedseveral other important factors which, although individually the outcome of theregime itself, also collectively ensured its continued existence. We may inferwith reasonable confidence that:• Earth must have been a stable planet and had been so for a long span ofgeological time;• The relative disposition of land and sea must have differed considerably fromthat of today;• Mountains were lower and deserts, where they existed, were less extensive thantheir modern counterparts, while seas were generally shallower;• Polar ice-caps, if they existed, must a priori have been of modest dimensions.Momentarily assuming the validity of these inferences we can further deducetherefrom that drainage systems were generally sluggish and largely silt-free;that sedimentary surface deposits predominated; that such uplands as existedwere ancient and eroded vestiges of once much higher features; that from longcontinuing natural dissolution caves and subterranean rivers were commonwherever limestone strata existed. From this it may also be inferred that theatmosphere possessed more carbon dioxide and oxygen (one of the by-products ofvigorous plant-cover) and more helium (see Part Five:3 on Collapsed Sky); thatstorms were comparatively infrequent; that a high humidity prevailed over muchof the globe; that both night-time and day-time skies were relatively cloudless,high-altitude thin clouds being the norm; and that precipitation over most landareas must have consisted chiefly of heavy nightly dews.Under such conditions vegetation inevitably proliferated vigorously, while theinferentially high volume of fertilising excrement deposited daily on land byhuge coeval animal populations also undoubtedly played a major role in promotingthis botanical luxuriance.It was against this topographically and climatically different background thatthe Phaeton disaster commenced, and thecollective experience of the human survivors of that event accumulated. Later,we shall see that this latter factor had a profound bearing on the ability ofindividual survivors to adjust to the drastically remodelled world into whichthey had been so roughly catapulted.A mere handful of traditions exist which allude to what may be termedantediluvian geography. Interestingly these are essentially consistent not onlywith each other but also with the general world picture inferred above. Thus,the Lushai people of Assam state that before the Deluge their homeland had beenlevel or plain-like, a physical condition also mentioned by such widely-sunderedtribes as the Bununs of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Tsimshian tribe of BritishColumbia 1 .Other traditions, however, refer to a great 'world mountain' called Meru, soupland regions and various peaks evidently existed then as well. The Atlasmountains of northwest Africa, for instance, may be such a pre-cataclysmic chain- with its south-western extremity and a sizable portion of the former adjacentAfrican mainland now partially submerged below the eastern North Atlantic.Classical Greek references to antediluvian times contain vague references to anas yet unidentified antediluvian range known as the Riphaean Mountains. Thepossible location of these will be considered more fully shortly.Again, if we admit the emotive cycle of Atlantis legends as valid but distortedmemories of some bygone reality, a large island existed somewhere characterisedby both lofty mountains and a wide plain. Furthermore, numerous Deluge legendsrefer specifically to mountains as sanctuaries for animal and human survivors,while as many others mention caves /'/; or under mountains as places of refuge.The survival in inland Borneo (Kalimantan) of certain topographical names which,according to the names assigned them, were anciently coastal features (capes,promontories etc), suggests that they also are fragmentary reminders of somelong-vanished antediluvian coastline 2 .Thus, while some antediluvian coastlines were up-heaved and now lie far inlandfrom present shores, others, together with their hinterland, were deeplysubmerged by the Phaeton calamity. Before that event, however, all marked theoutlines of landmasses of very unfamiliar configuration.The Mediterranean region generally and extensive areas of the North Atlanticwere also apparently very different topographically before Phaeton's visit.Numerous living and recently extinct biota recorded from those regions testifystrongly to this. The geographical distribution of the freshwater sponge(Heteromeyenia ryderi), presently confined to opposite sides of the NorthAtlantic and incapable of spreading except via freshwater habitats 3 , is a casein point. Continuous land, having freshwater lakes and rivers, must have unitedthese now widely-separated habitats until geologically recent times. In Part Twowe instanced many further similar biological examples, which do not needdetailing again here. Their collective testimony, however, is most eloquent.From these and the many additional details cited earlier we may reasonablydeduce that, under essentially genial climatic conditions, antediluvian landsurfaces were generally rather flat or undulatory, and that cave-perforateduplands and eroded mountain systems existed in various districts. Certainlylakes and marshes existed in areas now devoid of those features, and the longaxes of the oceans apparently ran in an east-west direction rather than thenorth-south direction that they do today.But other evidence indicative of this vanished earlier geography also exists. Itconsists of some very unusual maps depicting unexpected information of specialinterest to us here. Space precludes our consideration of more than one of them- a truly remarkable map showing, among other things, an ice-free Greenland andwhat appears to be the now-sunken landmass of Fennoscandia. This map (map 5A),which along with many others of generally similar import is considered by us inanother book, is generallypicture57 [images/picture57.jpg]known to scholars as the Zeno map, since it was compiled in 1380 AD fromobservations allegedly made by the Zeno brothers during a northern voyage theyare reputed to have undertaken earlier that century.The map's history is interesting. The original compilation lay unpublisheduntil, in the 16th century, G Ruscelli, a descendant of the Zenos, discovered itamong old family papers and printed it in 1558. This was followed by a revisedcopper-engraved version (1561-1558) which appeared in a Venetian edition ofPtolemy's celebrated 'world' atlas.Although active around 150 AD, Ptolemy, an Egyptian whose main studies had beenmade at Alexandria, was still regarded by 16th century geographers as theforemost geographer of all time, and whose maps -updated sporadically by laterscholars with the then-latest geographical discoveries and information - formedthe basis of the atlas of the world (as then known) at the time in common use.The Venetian printing incorporating the Zeno map was one such edition. The mapalso appeared in other editions, but, as far as is known, was not seen byPtolemy and probably never existed in his day in the version familiar to us,since this latter is itself a compilation of several older and quite separatecartographic documents. For that and other reasons several later cartographicauthorities have regarded the map as entirely fictitious 4 . Others, however,have concluded that the map reveals the Zeno brothers to have been \"honest andreliable observers\" 5 .Notwithstanding such conflicting opinions, all published versions of the Zenomap depict Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and northern Scotland (Scotia) veryclearly, yet simultaneously show several supposedly imaginary islands (Frisland,Icaria, Droggo etc) in the North Atlantic absent from modern maps of the samearea, and portray Greenland united to Scandinavia by an extensive northernlandmass.Babcock suggested that the outline of Greenland on the published versions ofthis map may have been taken from an early map of the region by Claudius Clavus(1427)or from another by Donnus Germanus (1466), and that Frisland was meant torepresent the Faeroes, Icaria the Shetlands, and Estotiland eastern Labrador\" 1. Be that as it may, the Zenos showed Greenland unambiguously and provide itwith an island-girt coastline virtually devoid of the fiords now socharacteristic of it, and with named mountain ranges and rivers.Today, Greenland has practically no rivers of any consequence - the courses ofthose which do exist are very short - and its mountains are all but buried underan enormous ice-cap which, in places, reaches a thickness of 6,000ft (1,850m).At this juncture two problems confront us: firstly, in view of the possiblyimaginary status of some of the islands on the Zeno map, can we accept asgenuine the unexpected topographical details depicted on Greenland?; andsecondly, how could surface features - rivers and mountain ranges - now deeplyburied under huge accumulations of ice, have been mapped at all if, according toconventional hypothesis, Greenland has been ice-mantled for scores of millenniaever since the inception of the assumed Tee Age'? Apart from recalling ourprevious conclusion that no Tee Age' of the kind envisaged by orthodoxglacialists apparently ever existed, it should be mentioned that thecartographic accuracy of the Zeno map has been investigated on several pastoccasions largely in connection with the original projections employed by themap's compilers.Various cartographic authorities have drawn attention to the apparent lack ofaccuracy in the positioning of certain topographical features, for example CapeFarewell, which on the original map is at 65°N. (whereas it should be at 60°N.),and suggested that the whole of the coastline had simply been skirted by ancientmariners and mapped by using only the very primitive sailors' compass of thatperiod 7 . This conclusion, of course, completely ignored the detailedhinterland of Greenland exhibited by the Zeno map.It was, in fact, completely demolished when Hapgood, who undertook a detailedanalysis of this and other early maps, found that when the polar projection andthe reconstructed grid were applied to the Zeno map and oriented to the correctnorth, Cape Farewell was actually located at 59°N, 44°W (its true co-ordinatesbeing 60°N, 44°W) 8 . This remarkable accuracy was repeated for four othergeographical features on both the east and west coasts of Greenland and forothers on the coasts of Iceland, Norway and western Europe, where bearingsseldom deviated from the true by more than onedegree, and often by less. Hapgood's investigations also revealed that the Zenomap was actually a compilation of four separate distinct maps drawn at differentscales and oriented to different norths which had later been combined to make alarger map\".When placed on a reconstructed Polar projection (figs 5.2abcd), the relativelongitudinal and latitudinal positions of identifiable features on the Zeno mapturn out to be extraordinarily accurate, and show that30°W20°W10°W10°EFig 5.1. The Zeno map of AD 1390 plotted on a reconstructed polar projection.The latitudes of southern Greenland have been corrected but not the longitudesof its western coastline (see also fig 5.2).picture58 [images/picture58.jpg]picture59 [images/picture59.jpg]Fig 5.2a.

Corrected version of the Zeno map ofGreenland superimposed on a modern map ofGreenland.Fig 5.2e. Seismic profile across central Greenland (see fig 5.2c).neither the Zeno map nor the four earlier maps from which it was compiled couldhave been drawn in the 14th century, when this type of projection was not used.Consequently, these maps and the information portrayed on them must date frommuch earlier times.Compared with modern maps, however, the western coast (only) of Greenland on theZeno map, even when placed on a reconstructed Polar projection, is found to belocated 18.5° of longitude too far to the east. We have repiotted the Zenoversion of this coastline in its correct modern position (map 5.B) - that is,18.5° further west - the resultant configuration of which (map 5.D) proves to beamazingly close to that of western Greenland today (map 5.C). Such closeresemblances suggest that the rivers and mountains shown by the Zenos in theinterior of Greenland are not, as some have speculated, purely imaginaryfeatures invented by medieval map makers. Closer examination of these detailshighlights some very significant facts.The whole of Greenland slopes from east to west, with a belt of folded mountainshaving an average height of 7,000ft (2,150m) lying along the eastern seaboard.Greenland is also tilted from south to north, so that strata in the extremesouth reach elevations of several thousand feet before abruptly plunging intothe sea. The Zeno map appears to suggest precisely this topography.The large central plain shown on the Zeno map is known to actually exist beneaththe present ice-cap in the region indicated, and is apparently a portion of thecrust now depressed below sea level by the enormous weight of the superincumbentice 10 .In order to determine the age of the Greenland ice-cap, a borehole was sunk atCamp Century (77°N, 61 °W), which reached bedrock at a depth of 4,705ft(1,387m). The contents of the extracted core was analysed using the theoreticalage-depth scale from the 'glacier-flow' theory. This scale estimated that icebored 3,705ft (1,140m) below the surface was probably 10,000 years old, whilethat at the very bottom of the coremust be about 120,000 years old. This latter date is commonly accepted as theage of the Greenland ice-cap generally. From these details it was concluded thatice moving from the centre of Greenland would take 20,000 years to reach thewest coast\".There are, however, reasons for doubting the validity of these estimated datesand of the methods used for interpreting the Camp Century core sample, for ithas been established that ice streams off Greenland at the rate of some 100ft(30m) per day, that even over a broad shallow front of 21 miles (4km) the dailyspeed is still 9ft (3m), and that the ice-discharge from the huge HumboldtGlacier, with its 60 mile (96km) wide front, is 31ft (9.5m) a day 12 . This rateof flow is attributable to the fact that on floating away seawards a lack offriction between detached and still-descending ice-masses enables the speed ofdischarge to be higher than that of a mountain glacier, where such frictionpersists. Thus, the Mer de Glace on Mt Blanc only proceeds at 1.6ft (0.5m) aday. Furthermore, experiments conducted to establish the age of ice-layers whichhad moved from the centre to the coast of Greenland showed that the iceaccomplished this in only 3,100 years 13 . Everything now points to theGreenland ice-cap being much younger than the 120,000 years estimated above.The fact that northern Greenland was apparently never glaciated has already beenemphasised. This is further confirmed by the dating of ground features foundthere and interpreted as being end moraines. These assumed moraines, which areassociated with uplifted marine terraces 200ft (62m) above sea level, haveproved to be only 8,000-6,000 years old. Indeed:No marginal moraines that are definitely older than Holocene have been found innorthern Greenland 14 .The late age of these moraines reappears on the east Greenland coast, whereexamples are only between 11,000 and 9,500 years old; and then, on the westcoast, both to the north and south of Disko Bay, upraisedterraces show that the area was ice-free even before Holocene times. Othermoraines at Taserqat date from some 10,000 years BP, at Avatdleq from 8,700years BP, and those at Mt Keglen between 7,200 and 6,500 years BP 15 .It is certainly relevant that it was at Atanekerdluk, near Disko Bay, that, lastcentury, an ancient tree, with a trunk \"thicker than a man's body\"\"', was foundstill standing erect on a hill at an elevation of 1,080ft (332m) by CaptInglefield. Had this region ever been glaciated in the manner commonly supposedby orthodox glacialists, this tree could never have flourished, while if it wasthe remnants of a 'pre-glacial' tree, it would have been demolished andcompletely removed by the advancing ice of the supposed 'Ice Age'.This is the conclusion already reached for so much of the present North Polarregion -no significant quantities of ice existed there until after the Phaetondisaster. Thriving vegetation, including sizable trees, could reasonably beinferred as normal land-cover for territory featuring prominent rivers andmountains like those on the ice-free Greenland shown on the Zeno map.Interestingly, expeditions made in the late 1940s to study the sub-glacialtopography of Greenland produced seismic profiles showing not only the thicknessof the ice but also the contours of the underlying land. This also confirmed theexistence of the central flat plain depicted on the Zeno map 17 .The unexpected modernity of the moraines of northern Greenland - clearlyaccumulated by bygone glaciers -, the 'short' apparent period (3,100 years)needed by ice to move naturally from central Greenland to the coast, and CaptInglefield's remarkable discovery of a long-dead erect tree in alleged'glaciated' country at Atanekerdluk, are all details which, with several othersmentioned earlier, suggest strongly that Greenland's present ice cover is anexceedingly youthful geographical feature - no more, perhaps, than 10,000-11,000years old. If true, this means that the original field surveys embodied in theZeno map may not,after all, be impossible. Man's ability to map ground features so early, and insuch detail and with such accuracy is not as yet an achievement accorded him inorthodox history books - despite the stunningly advanced astronomical andmathematical knowledge obviously known to several of the oldest of all knowncivilisations (see especially section IV: 15 on The Mesopotamian Connection. Allthese aspects are discussed in our forthcoming book The Maps which LeapfroggedHistory).But a 'young' age for Greenland's ice-cover contrasts sharply with the 120,000years estimated as the general age of ice at the bottom of the aforementionedCamp Century ice core. So also do the dates calculated for some of the lowest(oldest) ice cored recently at inland Greenland localities code-named Dye(1981), Renland (1987), GRIP and GSIP2 (1991-2) 18 . Collectively these indicatethat the oldest ice averages around 100,000 years BP, while their generalconsistency with one another suggests that they cannot all be erroneous. Acontradiction respecting the age of the Greenland ice-cover seemingly ariseshere. It would be reasonable to assume that one or other of these two sets of'young' and 'old' dates is wrong, for surely they cannot both be right. Or canthey?Plotting of the geographical coordinates of the sites of the Camp Century, Dye,Renland, GRIP and GSIP2 cores on the 'corrected' Zeno Greenland (map 5.B) showseach positioned over or upon the flanks of mountainous terrain; and becausethese ranges are given specific names on the Zeno map, they must have beenregarded as real ranges by someone at some distant time in the past. Today theyare smothered under thick snow and ice.Even in supposedly genial pre-cata-clysmic times these lofty mountains must havenaturally attracted some rainfall which, if the peaks were sufficiently high,would have fallen as sleet or snow (as on equatorial Mt Kilimanjaro today) andturned to ice on reaching actual land surfaces. The local development ofglaciers -perhaps not of great size but certainly ofgreat longevity, given the general stability of meteorological regimes then -even in such a benign era, would have been far from unnatural, and it may wellbe that 'old' ice studied at the bases of the above-mentioned cores is actuallyancient glacier ice rather than ice indicative of a general glaciation at least100,000 years old. The apparently incompatible ice dates and associated datafrom Greenland may thus not be contradictory after all, both these 'old' and'young' sets being equally valid. Interestingly, if interpreted along theselines, neither jeopardises the main thesis advanced in this book, or theessential validity of the Zeno map's portrayal of Greenland.Just conceivably these ice-blanketed mountains of Greenland are theaforementioned Riphaean Mountains of early Greek writers. Though possiblyreplete with glaciers, such once-accessible far distant ranges known viatraditions from times so ancient that even the classical Greeks regarded them aslegendary and no longer reachable, bespeaks of some now all but lostgeographical knowledge first accumulated by an early forgotten race capable ofland mapping ice-free (but now glaciated) regions to standards epitomised by theso-called Zeno map - the originals of which apparently antedate Greenland'spresent glacial regime.While it might perhaps be imprudent here to pursue these lines of enquiryfurther, certain other aspects of the Zeno map also merit attention.A further detail of the Zeno map concerns the absence of fiords presentlycharacteristic of both the east and west coasts of Greenland. Although the mapshows a heavily-indented Norwegian coastline and apparently emphasises anintricate archipelago along the northern Norwegian seaboard, neither thedepicted bays and inlets nor the islands readily conform to Norway's presentcoastal topography. Additionally, the map fails to include the Scandinavianplateau which, in southern Norway, contains peaks as high as 8,000ft (2,450m) ormore. This omission conceivably reflects a lack of data available to the Zenobrothers - or the map's Scandinavian sectoris possibly unfinished. It is difficult to imagine that such topographicalfeatures would have been deliberately ignored or omitted had information aboutthem been available.Notwithstanding such possibilities, however, we have previously seen that theorigin of the Greenland and Norwegian fiords apparently lies more with orogenicupheavals than with massive ice-sculpturing, and that it is unnecessary toascribe great lengths of time to their formation by ice action. This conclusionaccords well, of course, with what we have just learnt about the geologicallyyouthful nature of the present Greenland ice-cap, and its inferred absencebefore Phaeton's lithospherically-disruptive visit.It is interesting, therefore, that several authorities have recognised thegeological modernity of the Scandinavian mountains, some even advocating apost-'glacial' (ie, early Holocene) uplift 1 \". Forrest suggested that duringthe so-called Tee Age' they were less than 3,000ft (923m) high 20 . The factthat the Scandinavian uplands tilt downwards into the North Atlantic 21 alsocorrelates with the previously discussed data respecting the geologically recentcollapse of the old northern land of Fennoscandia which united North America andnorthern Europe. The Zeno map appears to show such a northern land-connection,not very dissimilar from that suggested from biological evidence by Scharff 22and others over ninety years ago.There are, therefore, apparently no genuine arguments for regarding the Zeno map- curious though it may seem to modern eyes - as portraying anything but thatwhich actually once existed on Greenland in the not so very remote past. All inall, the Zeno map strongly suggests that it constitutes a precious record of aportion of antediluvian geography - a geography which initially formed theterrestrial backdrop to the celestial drama dominated by Phaeton, and which waslargely destroyed and remodelled by that event.It is upon the modus operandi and actual sequence of the events, which wroughtsuch changes on Earth, that we must now focus attention.Confrontation«Ts%y^4**ar»In Part Four we left Phaeton (Marduk) and its attendants departing from thevicinity of Mars and heading for Earth, with Phaeton beginning to dischargeelectromagnetic bolts ('lightning') at the Moon. The subsequent interactionsbetween Phaeton's entourage and the Earth and Moon amounted to a confrontationof epic proportions. The gigantic physical changes sustained by Earth were bothstartling and sobering, and the accompanying annihilations not less so. At thisjuncture, however, we confine ourselves to merely outlining the main phases ofthis confrontation, reserving for later pages more detailed examination of themodus operandi of the calamity and the sequence of the different phasescomprising it.The enormous scale of this catastrophe and the relative positions of theparticipants as it unfolded are probably most simply conveyed by a series ofschematic diagrams (fig 5.3ab, cd, ef). Primarily these show the changingrelative positions of the principal antagonists at given phases of the drama,while almost certainly the participants moved, at least initially, on differentorbital planes. In order to better comprehend the suggested sequence of eventsand the relevant interactions involved, each diagram has been provided with abrief commentary tracing the most likely developments or those which can beinferred as having almost certainly occurred. Generally speaking, these formedan identifiable chain reaction.We have previously noted that the Moon appears to have formerly circled Earthmore closely than it does today - probably at no very remote time either. Fig5.3a shows the Moon moving along this nearer orbit round an Earth spinning fromwest to east on a nearly vertical axis. Phaeton and the smaller Kingu approachthe Earth/Moon system fromthe direction of Mars on their disruptive journey. For the sake of clarity, theminor but still dangerous lesser objects accompanying Phaeton and Kingu areomitted from this and the following diagrams.Special note should also be taken of the Roche zone shown enveloping Earth. Indue course, we shall see how the zone played a very important part towards thelater stages of the Phaeton disaster.Fig 5.3b, which represents a temporal interval of several days, shows a stilllargely unchanged Earth circled by the Moon on its pre-catastrophic orbit, butwith Phaeton and Kingu now nearing Earth as they attempt to fly past theEarth/Moon system on their sunwards journey. Electromagnetic exchanges betweenall these bodies would have steadily increased from this point, resulting in anelectrically enhanced terrestrial atmosphere, an intensification of magneticstorms, and a general rise in the temperatures of both Earth's atmosphere andhydrosphere.Ancient Persian traditions are especially noteworthy in mentioning that Phaeton(Tistrya or Tistar) repeatedly changed shape as it approached Earth. Thus, forten nights Tistrya moved \"with light in the shape of a man\", that for the nextten nights it assumed the shape of a \"golden horned bull\", and that for afurther ten nights it appeared as a \"white horse with golden ears\" 21 .From these descriptions - which interestingly span an entire month - one mightreasonably conclude that such shape changes were largely caused by theelectromagnetic activity occurring within Phaeton's entourage, that severalradiant bodies streaming lengthy tails were heading earthwards in comparativelytight formation, and that from time to time these either altered positionrelative to one another or, as theFig 5.3ab. Phaeton's path close to the Earth.Fig 5.3cd.picture61 [images/picture61.jpg]pom\\TEoa^^Lrrr-.-picture62 [images/picture62.jpg]Fie 5.3ef.E EarthK KInguM Moon (Lunar)P Phaeton (Marduk)Eo Earth's orbit round the Sun pom pre-catastrophic orbit of Moon nom New orbitof MoonLRZ Limited of Roche Zone of Earth IDK Ionized debris of Kinguobjects proceeded across the heavens, the overall perspective of the grouprepeatedly changed for terrestrial viewers. The Persian account stronglysuggests this scenario. Certainly, shape changes like these are not novel. Injust twenty-four hours, the configuration of some cometary heads has beenobserved to alter markedly. Fig 5.4 shows an example observed in 1862.Ancient descriptions which likened Phaeton to a serpent, a wolf, a horned bull,a horse, a lion's head, a boar, a giant bird, or to some mythological creaturelike a dragon, the behemoth, or the leviathan; or which refer to dusky tongues,manes, bristles, and gleaming eyes are obviously allusions to the ever-changingfantastic image of Phaeton during its awesome progress across the firmament, aprogress that in its later stages appeared to swing alternately towards thezenith or low to, or even below, the horizon, as Earth yawed unstably.As Hindu traditions correctly affirm, Phaeton was \"a dreadful spectacle\".Multifarious changes could, of course, be expectedin an object like Phaeton. Traditional references to them, far from beingfanciful, are almost certainly genuine if poetic accounts of what was actuallyseen. The following conjectural interpretations (figs 5.3c and 5.3d) graphicallyoutline what may have been observed in Earth's skies then.Fig 5.3c, which represents the probable situation after a further interval of aday or two, shows Phaeton and Kingu set on a path that will take them inside theMoon's orbit and to one side of the Earth's northern zenith. To Earthboundobservers their course was running contrary to Earth's rotation - asspecifically mentioned in Ovid's account of the disaster. Earth/Moon gravitationnow begins to affect the course of the intruders, while Earth, tilting axiallyfrom the vertical, starts to align itself towards Phaeton and Kingu.Terrestrial wobble and axial shift will also have been exacerbated by thealarmingly fast increase in seismic activity occasioned by the steadily nearingPhaeton and its entourage -activity which, dislocating the lithospherepicture63 [images/picture63.jpg]Fig 5.4. The head of a comet observed in August 1862. On the left, its aspect at9pm on August 23rd, and on the right its aspect exactly 24 hours later. After AGuillemin.worldwide, has been authoritatively described as being of \"...indescribable andoverpowering violence\" 24 . Its magnitude far transcended the 7.5 shown byHeirtzler's researches as the minimum for generating not only axial wobble andpolar shift but also for causing a geomagnetic reversal 25 . Magnetic chargesimparted to igneous rocks during this reversal are, as previously noted, knownto have been from ten to one hundred times stronger than any suppliable byunaided internal terrestrial mechanisms -Phaeton was the only co-existing close source capable of furnishing such massivecharges!Fig 5.3d indicates the probable position after a similar interval of time. TheMoon is shown still moving along its pre-catastrophic orbit as Earth's rotationeither ceases or is severely retarded by Phaeton and its attendants - now evencloser to Earth. At this point, the combined gravitational pull of Earth and theMoon apparently began to prize Kingu away from Phaeton's embraceFig 5.5. a.picture64 [images/picture64.jpg]Fig 5.5. b.picture65 [images/picture65.jpg]picture66 [images/picture66.jpg]■ M:WFig 5.5. c.picture67 [images/picture67.jpg]Fig 5.5. d.ioFig 5.5. a.

The same group at a later stage seen three-quarters head-on, broadlyresmbling a 'golden horned bull'.d. the same group seen later still when broadly resembling a 'horse'.and drag it inexorably towards Earth's Roche zone and ultimate destruction.Colossal electromagnetic exchanges must have continued unabated between Phaeton,Kingu, Earth and the Moon during this phase of the drama, as each object soughtto stabilise its own electromagnetic potential.The combined separation of Kingu from Phaeton and the stopping or slowing ofEarth's axial spin caused terrible havoc on Earth. The waters of the world'srivers, lakes and oceans were drained from their original basins and drawngravitationally to the point on Earth nearest (opposite) Kingu and Phaeton.Worldwide traditions remember this awesome effect.The retarding of Earth's rotation also resulted in the world's winds blowingwith a ferocity and intensity never experienced by modern people - winds whichflattened whole forests, whipped ocean billows to mountainous heights, movedgiant rocks and removed incalculable volumes of loose surface materials to verygreat distances. It was, in fact, remembered as a veritable diluvium venti.Meanwhile, the internal magma tides continued to flow below the tormentedterrestrial crust. Through the united gravitational influence of Kingu andPhaeton, they will have been slowly pulled towards that aspect of Earth nearestthose celestial bodies. This inevitably resulted in geoidal deformation, hugeportions of the lithosphere buckling, fracturing, subducting, collapsing oroverriding one another as simultaneously numerous mountain ranges wereup-heaved. Rivers of molten lava, rains of red-hot ash, and vast clouds ofvolcanic dust and gas swirled over enormous regions. Elsewhere rampant fireswill have consumed all living things in their path.At some localities volcanic gas clouds -nuees ardentes - transported largeboulders many miles, scored rock surfaces with striae closely resembling thoseoften ascribed elsewhere to glacial action, and, in company with high pressuregrit-charged steam, polished and carved rock surfaces and excavated entirevalleys. Concomitantly, avalanches of boiling mud ejected from volcanic ventsandfissures poured down hillsides and along valleys transporting more boulders andproducing further rock striations.Numberless burrowing creatures sought sanctuary from these scourges in theirunderground dens - refuges which, though temporarily successful, proved to befatal traps. Indeed, the mortality rate at that time among animals and plants ofall kinds was frighten-ingly high.Proceeding now to fig 5.3e, which represents a few hours later, we find Phaeton,unable to break the combined Earth/Moon gravitational field and so unable to'capture' the Moon, displacing it to a new (its present) orbit. Slav traditionsmention a 'star' or 'planet' named Gokihar ('Wolf-progeny') as the special\"disturber of the Moon\" at a time of great changes on Earth long ago 26 .Gokihar was presumably Phaeton.Kingu, however, now trapped in Earth's Roche zone, had begun to disintegrate.Such frozen liquids and atmosphere as Kingu may originally have possessed willhave become detached first, plummeting to Earth as blocks of ice, hail andgigantic masses of water (the pre-Deluge rain?). This process must haveaccelerated progressively, culminating in a mighty explosion, which hurledburning debris literally in all directions at high velocity and produced a blastwhich, among other things, caused the 'sky' or 'heavens' (actually the thickclouds of the 'collapsed sky') to open or part like a 'scroll'. Through thisopening some of the largest fragments of Kingu - the Norse sagas called them the'sons of Muspelheim' - plunged earthwards.Accompanying these were immense masses of smaller fragments - the rains ofgravel, showers of rocks and iron blocks, and falls of sand and dust ofworldwide traditions. Fire (ignited gases?), burning fluids (hydrocarbons?), andsticky ferruginous fluids reportedly fell with them, adding to the prevailingchaos. Although the overwhelming majority of these fragments ignited on enteringEarth's 'collapsed sky', either vaporising or exploding varying distances aboveground level, the so-called Carolina 'bays' of the eastern United States, thesmaller but otherwise closely similar 'bays' of Holland, andthe aligned 'lakes' of north-eastern Siberia, Alaska, northern Yukon andnorth-eastern Bolivia were apparently produced then. The dominant NW/SEorientation of all of these structures strongly suggests a common origin, andthat aerial agents formed them.As Phaeton's influence began to wane, Earth's rotational speed started toincrease again, although the planet generally still continued to suffer thecalamities outlined in our explanation of fig 5.3d.Fig 5.3f depicts the final phase of this terrible confrontation. The Moon isshown setting out on its new orbit. Earth has received Phaeton's legacy of analtered axial tilt and obscuring 'collapsed sky' conditions worldwide. Numerousfragments of the disintegrated Kingu continue to bombard Earth as concurrently,another of Phaeton's legacies, the Deluge, wreaks further havoc.With the destruction of Kingu and the sunwards departure of Phaeton, thederanged atmosphere and the gravitationally heaped-up terrestrial waters stroveto regain normality. Terrific gales continued to blow as Earth's atmosphereadjusted to changing topographical conditions, and both piled-up waters and theinternal magma tides began to return to equatorial regions. Numerous survivingaccounts describe the waters advancing like a colossal wave, or wall ofstupendous height and irresistible power. The relatively abrupt release of thewaters piled-up by Kingu's and Phaeton's combined gravitational influence willhave inevitably produced a Deluge having precisely these characteristics. Thatthe Deluge at many localities indeed assumed these proportions is confirmed notso much by the traditional descriptions but by the numberless physical evidencesof its massive charge across the landscape.The Deluge, careering headlong over hill and dale alike, charging upmountainsides and pouring down valleys, was checked only by the largest mountainranges or deflected by the mightiest cliffs. With the force of ten thousandNiagaras it will have poured precipitously into those collapsed portions of theEarth's crust destined henceforth to be thepresent ocean basins. Amid prevailing gloom it roared across the opencountryside obliterating or gathering up all organic matter in its path,carrying it long distances in battered and dismembered condition beforedepositing it along with incalculable volumes of sand, silt, gravel and stonydebris in caves and rock-fissures on every continent, often in the wildestdisorder, as densely-packed confused masses. Its waters extinguished innumerablefires and crushed or transported every movable object they encountered. Theyswamped caves, burrows and other underground refuges, drowning all creatureswhich had sought safety within them.The magnitude of the biological extinction achieved by the Deluge almosttranscends the imagination. It annihilated literally billions of biologicalunits of both sexes and every age indiscriminately. Only incredibly powerfulflood-waters operating worldwide could have achieved such results, and only aflood produced by the means previously suggested could have operated global-Finally, some thought should be given to the scale, rapidity and violence withwhich the successive phases of this confrontation took place, for not only arethese factors consistently confirmed wherever physical traces of their formeraction are yet discernible, but they are implicit in their very modus operandi.Giant electromagnetic storms, lightning, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,crustal dislocations, stupendous hurricanes, abruptly displaced bodies of water,celestial bombardments, rains of astonishing volume, and a mighty flood - allare quick-acting violent events.Individually, each may have persisted for an appreciable time, althoughthroughout its duration its actions are essentially rapid and impetuous. Theelements of speed, great scale and violent power unquestionably rendered thecharacter of each phase as phenomenal and terrible. So too were the extent andeffects. In short, the catastrophe was eminently memorable. Nothing like itbefore or since was known to humanity.With the draining away of the Deluge waters, Earth's confrontation with Phaetonwas over to all intents and purposes, although its tribulations were not. Beforeconsidering these, however, we must examine more fully the various componentphasesof the confrontation itself to appreciate how each formed a logical and coherentlink in a progressive chain of horrendous events totally unknown to modern Man.Collapsed Sky«Ts^t*-}>ij£fcsr»One of the earliest physical effects arising from Phaeton's visit was thephenomenon afterwards remembered traditionally as the Age of Darkness. Severalaccounts state that darkness enveloped the Earth before the onset of the Deluge,lasted throughout its duration, and endured for years after the flood waters hadsubsided. References to its persistence throughout early post-diluvial timesusually associated it with great cold. Its density and longevity were decidedlyexceptional, the former characteristic leading to at least one assertion that itwas not of an \"ordinary earthly kind\" 27 , and the latter to a general beliefthat the sky had 'fallen' or 'collapsed'.It can hardly be coincidence that numerous traditions speak of this 'CollapsedSky' as having fallen so low that people could not stand upright withouttouching it 28 ; of the darkness being so intense and the atmosphere so thickthat birds flew into one another and men and animals stumbled against each other29 ; and that it occurred at a time when the whole world was desolated 1 \" and aterrible heat enveloped the Earth and made its waters boil 31 .In Brazil, the Cashinaua Indians recall that deafening thunder and lightningaccompanied the 'collapsed sky' 32 , and many African tribes associated it withwidespread biological destruction. Thus the Ovaherero tribesmen assert that whenthe sky \"fell down\" long ago \"almost all the people were killed\", a beliefshared, too, by the Kanga people and Loanga tribe; and in Unyoro, the Wanyorotribe likewise speak of ancient times when the god Kagra threw the firmamentupon the earth to annihilate humanity 33 .The duration of the 'collapsed sky' varies considerably in the various survivingaccounts of it. Some merely speak of Earth being plunged \"in darkness for a longtime\" 34 , or for so long that the period was later regarded as an age of\"continuous darkness\" 35 . Several imply that the darkness persisted for years,and a Mexican account (mentioned in Part Three) states that it actually lastedfor twenty-five years. Certainly its persistence was everywhere traditionallyheld to have been abnormally long. We may never know its true duration, but thismore than likely varied in different latitudes and was governed at differentlocalities by local topography - the probable reason why differing estimates ofits duration are given in different traditions. Moreover, if perpetual darknessprevented the distinction of day from night, the true duration of 'collapsedsky' conditions would have been very difficult if not impossible to determine.The mechanism by which the natural terrestrial cloud cover could 'collapse'appears to necessitate: an initially massive and comparatively rapid evaporationof the Earth's surface waters; the subsequent condensation of those waters; andan equally massive and long-continuing pollution of the terrestrial atmosphereby suitable agencies. All such effects would, of course, result from other,still more fundamental, planetary activitiesinvolving among other things the production of great quantities of heat.We have seen that the pre-catastrophic climate must have been generally warm anddevoid of extremes over much of the globe. In such a climatic regime, widespreadcondensation in the guise of heavy dews must have occurred nightly, with watertables being relatively high. Several traditions independently aver that aterrible drought preceded the most dramatic expressions of the Phaeton disaster- the Conflagration and the Deluge. Fruit on trees shrivelled, crops failed andvegetation withered. Animals and birds migrated en masse from north to south' 6. Rivers and lakes began to dry up and sea temperatures rose. The evaporation ofEarth's waters had begun. A blistering heat pervaded everything and a thickeninghaze formed high in the skies. It was presumably this haze which, according tothe Amerindians of the Purus River region of Brazil, made the Sun and Moon turnred, blue and yellow.Atmospheric distortion must have commenced then, as that part of Earth'satmosphere opposite or nearest the oncoming Phaeton and Kingu was slowly pulledgravi-tationally towards those bodies. This derangement probably assumed theform of a curved cone or plume which streamed outwards a considerable distancetowards the celestial visitors, with the lightest gases (eg helium) being themost affected.In other words, the terrestrial atmosphere was being held in a distortingpattern while Earth itself continued to rotate normally. Coupled with theintensifying electromagnetic conditions mentioned previously, winds must havebeen hot and dry in virtually all latitudes, contributing to a massiveevaporation of superficial waters generally. Such evaporation inevitablyresulted in the formation of a thickening cloud cover. Initially this waspresumably the 'thick mist' alleged to have shrouded Hera (Earth) whilePallas-Athene (Phaeton) was still far distant (see Part Four); later it reached'collapsed sky' proportions.Even from the onset of the confrontation between Earth and Phaeton violentelectro-magnetic exchanges between these bodies would have been inevitable. Certainly atlater stages of the cataclysm we are told that these exchanges became almostcontinuous - Pima Indian legends mentioning that even the advancing Delugewaters were cut by incessant lightning. Thus, early atmospheric effects musthave included a heavy smell of burnt electricity. Surely significant, therefore,is the Samoan recollection that what we may take to have been just such a smellwas noticed before the formation of huge clouds (relatively unfamiliar objectsin antediluvian skies) which preceded the great Conflagration.Unquestionably many of these initial electromagnetic exchanges reached groundlevel, igniting dehydrated forests or tearing up land surfaces. Numerous welldocumented modern instances are known of such disturbances, even though theseobviously involve discharges infinitely smaller than those which must havepassed between Earth and Phaeton. The following example shows how even a minorevent of this kind can wreak appreciable damage. After a lengthy drought duringAugust 1900, a thunderstorm arose in the forested Adirondack mountains andpassed over Lake Champlain, USA. A lightning discharge occurred, striking theground on the northern slope of Split Rock Mountain and setting fire to trees sothat in under five minutes a \"well-developed forest fire was under way\". Allaround the point of impact dirt and rocks had been torn up with such force thatrocks had been fractured and shattered, and fragments llOlbs (49.5kg) or more inweight were flung about 17 .V H Barnett has detailed similar cases in this category, which possibly have abearing on the origin of some of the so-called 'glacial erratics'. He mentions areport of a great mass of rock being broken and thrown down the Llyn Teyrn inNorth Wales by lightning during a severe thunderstorm in August 1898, andHibbert described the effects of lightning on the cliffs on the east side ofFetlar Island (Shetland) as follows:A rock 105ft long, 10ft broad and in some places more than 4ft thick, was in aninstant torn from its bed, and broken into three large and several lesserfragments.One of these, 26ft long, 10ft broad and 4ft thick, simply turned over. Thesecond, which was 28ft long, 17ft broad and 5ft in thickness, was hurled acrossa high point of a rock to the distance of 50 yards. Another broken mass, about40ft long, was thrown still farther but in the same direction, quite into thesea. There were also many lesser fragments scattered up and down. 38If comparatively minor modern lightning discharges can cause damage on thisscale, one is certainly left pondering the likely effects of the immeasurablygreater examples exchanged between Earth and Phaeton.Celestial electromagnetic exchanges of the size and frequency suggested mustalso have generated electrical currents not only on Earth's surface but alsodeeper, selecting metalliferous (better conducting) strata, following metallicveins - perhaps to great depths within the crust - and producing huge thermalincreases worldwide. Repeated discharges on this scale would quickly generatesufficient heat to cause: almost instantaneous expansion of the water naturallylocked up in crustal strata, resulting in extensive fissuring and splitting ofsurface rocks; the upwards flow of magma from the deeper fissures; and theactivation of volcanoes. Oceans and seas would have boiled and steamed. Incombination, these disturbances would, through a general release of heat, smokeand dust, initiate atmospheric pollution that would last for decades.On rising into the atmosphere, these pollutants would have begun to seriouslyimpair visibility while their rapid formation as dust or gas would have inducedfurther electrical activity, conditions thereby going from bad to worse.The now famous Mt St Helens volcanic eruption of May 1980 released an immenseamount of ash and dust into the atmosphere, which ultimately affected at leasttwo-thirds of North America (map 5B). In some areas it reached as much as 8tonnes per acre, and that some 300 miles (480km) from the eruption itselP. Theburial of Pompeii andHerculaneum under prodigious quantities of volcanic ash in AD 79 was a classicexample, although only marginally worse than that occurring in 1914 whenSakurajima volcano in Japan all but buried innumerable buildings in its vicinitywith similar ejecta (fig 5.6). The still more recent eruption of El Chicon inMexico on April 4th 1982, hurled into the atmosphere more than five times theamount of material than the Mt St Helens explosion, and ranks as one of thelargest of modern times.Large volcanic eruptions can also seriously lower atmospheric temperatures.Thus, in 1783, Laki volcano erupted in Iceland and Asama volcano erupted inJapan. Though not exceptionally large, in combination they exerted a pronouncedcooling effect on the world's atmosphere, not only in that year but also on thetwo that followed, which: \"...were the coldest on record in the northernhemisphere\" 4 \". They created widespread dense fogs, whereby the Sun remainedinvisible until it had climbed 17° above the horizon - and that was in southernFrance in June!In 1815, one of the most violent eruptions of all time occurred when Mt Tamborathrew so much ejecta skywards that even 312 miles (500km) away the dust hung sothickly that: \"...there was total darkness for three days - followed by lengthytwilight and brilliant sunsets elsewhere\" 41 . Globally, temperatures fell 1.1°C below the annual norm, and 1816 was a year without a summer.The role played by volcanic ash and dust released into the atmosphere is, eventoday, a significant one. For example, it has been determined that dust cloudserupted near the equator pollute the atmosphere and endure from 1 to 2 years,those erupted in middle latitudes from 3 to 5 years, and those in polarlatitudes for up to 10 years 42 .Particularly intense vulcanism is known to have characterised 'late Pleistocene'times, truly enormous eruptions occurring in the areas embraced by the NorthPacific 43 , Antarctica and Iceland 44 . Literally thousands of volcanoes wereactive then (see table 5A). Their collective pollution of the atmosphere2-30 mm 30- 70 mmpicture68 [images/picture68.jpg]Map 5B. General extent of ash-fall from Mt St Helens over North America, whicherupted on May 18th 1980.

It has been suggested that this 'late Pleistocene'vulcanism may have seriously defiled Earth's atmosphere for up to 100 years 45 .The volume of volcanic dust poured skywards at any given time is also important.Large quantities initiate the development of sulphuric acid in the upperatmosphere, leading to the formation of thick cloud cover. Atmospheric pollutionis worst and persists longest in high latitudes because, there, the dust veilcauses the greatest depletion of the Sun's rays by screening both solar andterrestrial radiation through the formation of the cloud-cover. The resultantlower temperatures accordingly permit an increase in the build-up of snow andice - the former producing a heat-reflective albedo effect, and the latter anentrenchment of continuously cool or cold conditions, and a weakened circulation46 .As well as dust particles, volcanic eruptions also release sulphur compounds,potash, potassium, C0 2 , and particles of glass 47 . In combination these couldlower temperatures globally by up to 3°C, or perhaps even more.Since it is well known that lightning often accompanies volcanic eruptions itwould be reasonable to suppose an atmosphere heavily polluted with volcanic andfissure ejecta would tend to become increasingly electromagnetic. Electricaldischarges must, therefore, have steadily increased between the thickeningatmosphere and the tormented land surface, as concurrently larger ones generallycontinued to be exchanged between Earth, Phaeton, and the latter's entourage.The sheer weight of the polluted atmosphere would have forced the cloud basedown to unprecedentedly low levels.There is. therefore, a clear connection between the phenomenon of a 'collapsedsky', repeated electromagnetic exchanges between celestial bodies, and giantcrustal dislocations generating both heat and atmospheric pollutants on a grandscale. A similar connection, considered more fully later, is equally discerniblebetween a 'collapsed sky' situation and atmospheric defilement by vast burningforests and ignited petroleum.It is also more than probable that most of Earth's helium was lost during thisdisaster.picture69 [images/picture69.jpg]Table 5ASome areas of major volcanic activity regarded by vulcanologists as being of'late Pleistocene' or 'late Quaternary' age.

It isproduced by the natural radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in theterrestrial crust. Investigations have shown that, at the present known rate ofdecay, and provided that uninterrupted decay has been going on since timeimmemorial, there ought to be a thousand times more helium in Earth's atmospherethan thereactually is. Scientists at the US National Bureau of Standards who studied thisenigma in 1964 concluded that the loss of so much helium could very well havebeen due to some geologically recent \"catastrophic event\", in which the gas was\"boiled off .* Theoretically at least, the Phaeton disaster provided all theconditions under which this could have occurred.Earth Fracturet-^Sit^ias^r>The gigantic worldwide tectonic disturbances of 'late Pleistocene' timesoccurred almost simultaneously on a near-unimaginable scale - precisely whatcould be expected from a powerful external influence but not from the 'Ice Age'conditions conventionally believed to have existed then. The key factorunderlying these tremendous changes was massive crustal fracture.Interestingly the planetary scale and geological youthfulness of Earth's crustalfracture-complex has encouraged several high authorities to conclude that itresulted from an external rather than internal influence. We also previouslynoted that the Martian crust appears to have been similarly fractured, and that,in an ancient Babylonian epic, the planet Tiamat was fatally fractured anddestroyed during a celestial encounter with a fiery sunlike object calledMarduk. And since Marduk was seemingly identical with Phaeton, traditionallyremembered as having anciently caused extensive topographical changes on Earth,could the terrestrial fracture-complex have resulted from the same dynamicalprocess that destroyed Tiamat and fissured Mars?If we examine this possibility further, it is noteworthy that Mars, like Earth,presentlyrotates once about every 24 hours, that the two innermost planets, Mercury andVenus, rotate much more slowly, but that the outer planets (Pluto excepted)rotate much more rapidly (see table 4A, Planetary Statistics). In the Babylonianepic Tiamat apparently orbited the Sun as an asteroidal planet somewhere betweenMars and Jupiter.We are not told Tiamat's size, however, although an apparent image of it on aBabylonian cylinder seal (fig 4.11c) indicates that it was larger than Earth,and modern estimates of a now-lost asteroidal planet suggest a massapproximately 90 times that of Earth 49 . Thus, as an astronomical body, Tiamatwas sizable, although not really large. Due to its likely distance from the Sun,Tiamat could be envisaged as a planet having a solid rocky body not improbablyice- or water-covered, enveloped by an atmosphere more akin to those typical ofJupiter and the outer planets. Quite possibly, Tiamat may have rotated morequickly than Mars and Earth - perhaps in 18 or 20 hours - whereby its rate ofspin at its equator (and hence that of any internal magma it may have possessed)was by any standard quick.A fast-spinning sizable body like this, braked or stopped by a powerful externalagent, would - largely because any internalmagma would probably continue to rotate within the halted outer crust -literally come to pieces. Intolerable pressures and thermal increments wouldfracture and disrupt the latter. Faster-spinning larger bodies, such as theouter planets, could through sheer size and rotational speed override all butthe very greatest external influences, and crustal and magmatic disruption wouldbe minimal or non-existent. Similarly, a slow-spinning sizable body, externallyretarded or braked to a halt, would also probably avoid fatal disruption, since,irrespective of the object's size or bulk, the braking process, while moreeasily accomplished, would obviously involve less crustal dislocation than ifthe rotation was speedier.This seems to have been the case with Mars and Earth. Although the formerevidently suffered orbital distortion and its rotation may have been sloweddown, Earth, too, conceivably once rotated more slowly, a day consisting perhapsof about 30 hours.We suggest, therefore, that at the onset of Phaeton's confrontation with Earth,the Earth's rate of spin was probably the single most important factor whichdetermined its survival as a planet. Had its rotation been more rapid, it couldwell have shared Tiamat's fate. Combined with its powerful gravitational fieldoccasioned by its essentially solid lithos-pheric construction, Earth's slowerrotational rate prevented it from breaking up - although not, in our submission,by any great margin. Indeed, at the height of the catastrophe Earth's survivalapparently came close to a situation best described as 'touch and go'.As it was, Earth sustained fearful crustal damage during its encounter withPhaeton, and acquired an almost completely rearranged topography. The formerdisposition of land and sea was changed, a new world mountain system came intobeing, the number of active volcanoes was augmented enormously, a legacy ofseismic activity was bequeathed which is far from over, a new land drainagepattern was instituted, and completely different oceanic and atmosphericcirculatory regimes were established. While it is hardly necessary to reiteratethe extreme youthfulness of these environmental components, we should stressthat from what is known of geophysics and the theoretical interplay of two ormore similar-sized confronting celestial bodies, all such planetary changes areexactly what could be expected to occur. Gold 50 , Warlow 51 and Sagan 52 , tomention just three, have all surmised as much.A look now at some modern instances of horrendous crustal effects will enable usto better glimpse the sheer enormity and extent of the changes wrought duringPhaeton's visit. Even these examples are necessarily pale echoes of thoseimmeasurably greater and still more violent earlier analogies. Earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, tidal waves (tsunamis), mud-slides, avalanches, dust clouds,and various ejecta, will be among those examined. This evidence, when magnifiedto the probable scale and intensity of the equivalent events during the Phaetondisaster, is as sobering as it is awesome, and conjures up mental images fromwhich, even today, thousands of years later, the mind recoils numbed andappalled.Of the many terrible earthquakes that have occurred at intervals within livingmemory -among which those of San Francisco, Quetta, Agadir and several in Turkeyinstantly spring to mind - probably none was more severe than that which, justbefore noon on 1st September 1923, struck the twin Japanese cities of Tokyo andYokohama. In the present context this was an unusually instructive event becauseit also involved a retreat of the sea, a gigantic tidal wave, a landslide, atremendous rocky avalanche and a terrible fire. The full extent of thedestruction meted out by these agencies did not become apparent until thecompletion some while later of official Japanese enquiries, which disclosedtruly horrific details.The following statistics suffice to convey the scale of that disaster. In Tokyodestruction was incredibly rapid everywhere. Four-storey concrete buildingsdisintegrated 'in the flash of an eye', tiles cascading with precipitous speedfrom roofs. Fires broke out all over the place -252 in all, of which only 40were contained or extinguished - and 71% of the city, or some 366,262 houses,was incinerated. Neighbouring Yokohama was eventually com-pletely gutted by fire within twelve hours. No fewer than 38,015 human victimsof the holocaust were finally counted, many of them having died of heatsuffocation.Around Sagami Bay, the final figures of casualties from fire, earthquake andtidal wave was 99,333 killed, 43,476 missing and 103,733 injured. Of buildings,128,266 had totally collapsed, 126,233 had half-collapsed or sufferedirreparable damage, 447,128 had burned down and 868 had been demolished or sweptaway by the tidal wave. The overall total of destroyed buildings was 576,262 53.The avalanche, beginning on the 3,000ft (923m) high peak of Mt Hiziridake, justover 4 miles (6.4km) inland, consisted of a wall of dirt and rocks which roaredacross the country obliterating everything in its headlong rush towards the sea,at a speed subsequently calculated to have been approximately a mile-a-minute(95kph). The speed and volume was attested by the debris it deposited along thevalley slopes forming its route, at heights exceeding several hundred feet as itrounded curves in its course 54 .From just this one terrifying event, 718 aftershocks occurred in September, 96in October, 86 in November, 139 in December, and 167 in January 1924 55 . Howmuch worse and globally more numerous must have been the aftershocks followingthe departure of Phaeton?Probably the most notorious earthquake recorded since modern archives began wasthat which devastated Lisbon on November 1st 1755. It was so powerful that itwas also clearly felt in Morocco and Algeria 1,000 miles (1,600km) or so to thesouth. Between eight and ten thousand people, together with their cattle,camels, horses and other animals, were swallowed up by abysses which closed overthem again, the ground presenting the same surface appearance as it had beforethe dreadful event 56 .Often more destructive than earthquakes are the subsidiary catastrophesaccompanying them. Those must have been common at the time of and immediatelyfollowing the Phaeton disaster.In the celebrated earthquake of 1811 at New Madrid in Missouri, for example,entireislands disappeared in the Mississippi River and local flooding caused greatloss of life 57 .Certainly, the burial of some 25,000 people by the Huascaran avalanche, causedby seismic activity in the Yungay and Ranrahirca region of Peru on May 31st 197058 falls into this category. This avalanche poured down the valley at no lessthan 200mph (320kph)! Its motion resembled a great wave, and, in the words ofone nearby observer: \"The crest of the wave had a curl like a huge breakercoming in from the ocean. I estimated the wave to be at least 80m (160ft) high\"5 ''. At some places it buried the valley with debris to a depth of 260ft (80m),and transported huge boulders, some as large as 19.5 cubic yards (15 cubicmetres), long distances before dumping them at all sorts of locations.A comparable landslide of 1,300 million cubic yards (1,000 cubic metres)occurred at Mayunmarca, also in Peru, in 1974. In only 4 minutes it descended avertical distance of 4,800ft (1,500m) at a speed of 75-87mph (120-140kph) andwas completely irresistible 60 .The volume of material moved by landslides is sometimes awesomely great. AtFrank, in Alberta, for example, one such slide involved approximately 39,650,000cubic yards (30,500,000 cubic metres) of rock 61 . Last century, a land-slip atGohna, in Himalayan India, involved the 4,000ft (1,230m) vertical descent of somuch rock debris that it piled up in moments to a height of 800ft (246m) andcompletely blocked the local river. The force carried debris half way up -2,000ft (615m) - the opposite side of the valley and hurled large boulders amile or more away. So much dust rose into the air that the district remaineddarkened for several days 62 .Such instances graphically illustrate how giant rock-slides and avalanchesoccurring on a global scale during the Phaeton disaster could have obliteratedand buried extensive areas of the pre-catastrophic landscape, and how much ofthis material - subsequently rearranged by the Deluge waters following closelyupon its dislodgement - has been recorded as 'drift' filling up entire valleys.Pari Five: Anatomy of a DISASTER 265Submarine earthquakes, such as must have undoubtedly occurred during Phaeton'svisit, also often generate highly destructive subsidiary calamities. Tsunamis(tidal waves - a Japanese term) are among the worst and commonest of these, andcan be up to 500 miles (800km) long. In the ocean itself, the waves may be onlya few feet high, but on reaching coastal margins sometimes attain enormousheights. One recorded in 1737 at Cape Lopotka, Kamchatka, was as much as 210ft(65m) high. Still larger ones have been reported, and wave speeds of between 300and 500mph (480-900kph) are known, with water pressures reaching 8001bs persquare foot. The velocity of the falling crest of a wave combined with the speedof advance reaches 49 tonnes per square yard for a wave only 30ft (9m) high 63 ,so we can only imagine the pressure exerted by the largest modern waves or bythose occurring during the Phaeton disaster.Their capacity to devastate must have been tremendous when we consider that atsunami caused by a submarine earthquake near the Tuscarora Deep south of Japanin June 1896 roared in from the sea as a 75-100ft (23-31m) high wave whichengulfed whole villages and left no trace either of them or their inhabitants.In moments, 27,122 people were annihilated, thousands more injured, and 10,617dwellings swept away 64 .Additional hazards accompanying earthquakes include emissions of natural gases,sulphurous odours and seepages of petroleum and bituminous substances 65 . Didwe not read in Part Three of poisonous blasts and rivers and lakes of fire, ashaving been among the traumas which reportedly beset early humanity at the timeof the Phaeton disaster? Gases and petroleum seepages would have affordedprecisely these effects.But earthquakes even of the magnitude just mentioned are hopelessly inadequateexplanations for the collapse of ocean basins, the formation of rift valleys andfracture complexes of global extent. These are clearly the outcome of the morefundamental process of plate tectonics, which alone appears to be capable ofdislocating the lithosphere. Infinitely larger and more dramatic than anyproduced byeven the severest known earthquake, the results usually manifest themselves asenormous faults. They are the true lines of Earth fracture.Arguably the most famous example is the San Andreas fault in California (fig5.7), but others equally representative are known from every continent. Allusually occur as scarp faces separating faulted blocks of land (tectonicplates), the scarps often rising, sometimes vertically, high above thesurrounding countryside. A splendid instance is the nearly straight faultbordering Lake Mobutu Sese Seko (Albert) in Uganda, the scarp face towering to aheight of almost 975ft (300m) and evincing every sign of being geologically veryyouthful (fig 5.8).As previously noted, these rock faults accompanied the widespread orogeny ofTate Pleistocene' times. The San Andreas fault, for example, is associated withthe latest uprise of the Sierra Nevada range, while another of still greaterdimensions (the Indo-Gangetic trough), has long been associated with theelevation of the Himalayas 66 . This latter is actually a gigantic crack, nowlargely in-filled with alluvial deposits, stretching more or lessuninterruptedly from Sumatra, round the Arrakan coast, across northern India andthrough the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean 67 .It is parallelled further north by another crack marking the centre line of asuccession of mountains running from south Asia, through Asia Minor and theBalkans to the Alps 68 . It is now filled with serpentine, a rare deep-seatedrock, which must have welled up from immense depths. Both cracks are connectedwith the latest uprise of the Alps and with the formation of the Mediterraneanbasin occasioned by the collapse of the old Tyrrhenian continent.Interestingly, Burrard, a former surveyor-general of India, concluded that theuprise of the Himalayas and the associated crustal fractures resulted from adeceleration of Earth's rotation, and that:It looks as if our Earth had in the distant past received a tremendous blow fromoutside... 69picture70 [images/picture70.jpg]Fig 5.7. The San Andreas crustal fault in California. Photo: W A Gamett,California.picture71 [images/picture71.jpg]Fig 5.8. The fault bordering on Lake Mobutu Sese Seko, Uganda. By permission ofDavid & Charles, Newton Abbot.Obviously Burrard envisaged a celestial force, although he failed to specify itsidentity. In our submission, Burrard's 'blow' was administered by Phaeton,although we do not consider that actual physical contact occurred between thatobject and Earth. The electromagnetic, thermal and gravitational interplaybetween the two bodies sufficed at the time to fracture the terrestrial crust inthe manner now discernible.Using varied material, Mantura 70 and others have recenitly questioned thevalidity of the currently-fashionable theory of continental drift. Others, likeOppenheim, have concluded that, as presently advocated, the concept is grosslyoversimplified and that the key to its understanding lies in the pattern ofglobal crustal fracture zones. As Oppenheim said:This pattern... would suggest that expansion of the Earth's crust has takenplace 71 .Vast amounts of thermal energy could achieve such expansion. As the greatmajority of these fractures are demonstrably young features and an exceptionallypowerful geomagnetic reversal (over 100 times stronger than terrestrialmechanisms could produce) occurred approximately 11,500 years BP, when thePhaeton disaster took place, so much thermal energy was seemingly generated thatexpansion of the underlying magma resulted in Earth's crust literally crackingapart like the shell of an overheated egg.If true, this may even have distorted the geoidal shape. Very significantly,Taira 72 has suggested that such a geoidal distortion accompanied severevulcanism in eastern Asia coincidentally with the onset of cold (glacial)conditions at the beginning of Holocene times (ie, immediately after the Phaetonevent). In all probability the difference between 'during' and 'immediatelyafter' is illusory.picture72 [images/picture72.jpg]*l0.*^Fig 5.9. Major tectonic plates of the Earth (broken lines) compared with aprojection of a regular icosahedron (solid lines) on an azimuthal equidistantprojection (after Spilhaus).Mantura, moreover, has argued that the curious shapes of the major tectonicplates -produced by crustal fracturing - show the theory of continental drift tobe false, while Spilhaus has demonstrated that the shapes of the plates and thetriple points formed where the plates naturally meet coincide very closely withthe vertices of an icosahedron (fig 5.9). He added:Triple points are important, such as the cracks in Pangaea [the originaltectonic plate which split into present continental plates], which typify whathappens in a homogeneous material that is uniformly stressed. 7 - (Our italics)Recent explorations in Arizona have highlighted puzzling seismic data fromlevels deep in the continental crust. These concern the homogeneity ofmiles-thick sheets of crystalline rock, which have been forcibly pushed hundredsof miles over younger sedimentary deposits. Similar homogeneous sheets, up to 61miles (10km) thick, have also been noted in the southern Appalachians, wherethey have been moved bodily westward by as much as 140 miles (225km), while inUtah another almost identical example has apparently been pulled down a vastinclined fault 74 . In every case, the sheets appear to have slid while moltenover the strata now underlying them -yet, in doing so, they remained intact, aseemingly impossible but nevertheless real effect.A uniformly exerted stress would be one method by which this remarkable resultcould be achieved. Certainly the thermal energy unleashed by these events musthave been appalling. These details, coupled with Spilhaus' observation on whathappens to uniformly stressed homogeneous rocks, provide sobering insights intoboth the linear and vertical extent of the crustal disturbances characterisingPhaeton's visit. The lateral displacement of enormous pieces of Earth's crusthas been noted in Part One, where we saw that, like other major mountain ranges,the Rockies were pushed many miles over adjacent strata.In Nigeria, sets of uniformly straight parallel crustal fractures, each hundredsof mileslong and aligned almost due north-south, have resulted from the application of amassive compressive stress. Investigators of these huge cracks actuallysuggested that their near-meridional orientation was due to a change in thespeed of Earth's rotation, and that this was probably induced by a near-miss orthe oblique impact of a cosmic body! 75 . Although that proposed eventsupposedly occurred millions of years ago, considerable field evidence existsthat these Nigerian fissures may really be geologically very recent. If so, theunspecified cosmic body just postulated could very well have been Phaeton.Gigantic east-west crustal derangements reach great visual prominence in theCentral American-Caribbean region and in eastern Indonesia. In the formerregion, these displacements occurred during late Quaternary times when colossalportions of the lithos-phere slid past one another or subducted 7b . Directlyassociated with the Clarion fracture zone in the eastern Pacific 77 , with theSan Andreas fault in California and its southern extension in the Gulf ofCalifornia 78 , with the deep-sea trench off Guatemala and with thetrans-Mexican volcanic belt 7 \", these upheavals were also connected furthersouth with a similar belt of major tectonic collapse features which, inGuatemala and San Salvador, include the stunning Coatapepeque caldera and theIlopango depression 80 .Indonesia virtually duplicates the Central American region just considered.There also an east-west crustal dislocation of surprising modernity andstupendous proportions is present. It profoundly affected the biology of theregion as represented by Wallace's Line 81 .The sudden slowing of Earth's rotation, therefore, inevitably caused severecrustal fracturing worldwide. The continued rotation of the semi-fluid moltenmagma below Earth's halted or decelerated crust resulted in vastly increasedthermal energy and, not improbably, in temporary geoidal deformation. In suchcircumstances the greatest stresses would mostly be experienced in tropicallatitudes where both surface and subterranean magma speeds are naturally higherthan in polar regions. The direction ofsuch stresses would tend to override that of planetary rotation.Lithospheric fracturing and the subduction and over-thrusting of crustal platesof the magnitude being contemplated would inevitably compress and buckle someportions of the terrestrial surface (causing the uprise of mountains andplateaux) while simultaneously stretching others to the point"},{"pageContent":"where massive crustal fracturing and collapse would occur. The African RiftValley the floor of the Atlantic either side of the mid-Atlantic ridge, theMediterranean basin, the dropped ocean floor off Kamchatka, and the Turfandepression in central Asia, all appear to be examples of such crustal collapse,and geologically very recent ones at that.Fire-storm«TS3fe-}-4*SHT\"»The ferocious magnetic storms in Earth's atmosphere coincident with thewidespread drought and botanical desiccation which typified the terribleconfrontation between Earth and Phaeton, allied to the furious winds generatedby the braking of Earth's rotation and an attendant axial shift, quicklyproduced Fire-storm conditions.Moreover, crustal sliding and disruption over magma intensely heatedelectromagneti-cally by a massive polarity reversal, together with concurrentvolcanic eruptions and mag-matic outpourings on a tremendous scale, increasedglobal thermal levels catastiophical-ly. Tinder-dry grasslands and forests(often of resinous timber) perished in frightful holocausts. Water temperaturesrose, and rivers, lakes and even seas eventually began to steam and boil. Asconditions progressively deteriorated, metalliferous veins in surface strata,often acting as natural lightning conductors, began to melt or fuse, with thesofter ores (eg, lead, tin and gold) liquefying quickest and finding their wayinto rock fissures and other cavities. The presence of iron ore and other metalsin several bone-fissures was noted in Part Two. Evidence for all these and thefollowing effects of great heat and rampant fire at the close of so-called'Pleistocene' times abounds on almost every continent.Near-endless torrents of hot volcanic ejecta rained down upon huge areas;immense clouds of inflammable gases escaping from seismic fissures and volcanicvents rolled over the terrain, bursting into flame or, as nuees ardentes,buoying up enormous boulders and other debris for long distances beforedepositing them at all sorts of locations; exploding gases and other volcanicsubstances created blast effects of appalling severity, and high pressure jetsof grit-charged steam and heated water carved out, striated or drasticallyaltered local topography.In other regions, avalanches of boiling mud, spewing out of vents and chasms,compounded the unbridled chaos. These overwhelmed whole forests, filled upentire valleys, buried rivers and small lakes, scored rock surfaces andtransported sizable boulders many miles from their original sources. In short,the terrible world conflagration of universal tradition had begun.The traditional recollections of this holocaust are frequently most graphic, andoften contain interesting supplementary information about it. They show thatnothing remotely resembling this conflagration has been experienced bypresent-day humanity. Even the severest modern volcanic outpourings or forestfires fall very short of what clearly took place then.Nevertheless, as the following examples clearly indicate, even thesedisturbances furnish valuable insights into what must have happened on animmeasurably greater scale during Phaeton's visit.Today, approximately 500 terrestrial volcanoes are considered to be active ordormant* 2 (potentially active). The number of extinct cones, however, greatlyexceeds this - and when one contemplates that many presently extinct volcanoeswere active a mere thousand years ago, the rate of extinction, even if onlyapproximately constant over the last 11,500 years, indicates that volcanicactivity around that date was severe. Indeed, the volcanic record confirms this,for literally thousands of volcanoes were active during and immediatelyfollowing Phaeton's visit (see table 5A). Little imagination is needed tovisualise the colossal volume of 'hot' volcanic material - lava, mud, ashes,dust, gases, steam, smoke, etc - ejected then. The following modern reports andobservations clearly reveal that it cannot have been otherwise.Observations of geologically recent vulcan-ism encountered in Mato Grosso,Brazil, by Savage-Landor in 1912 concerned volcanic lapilli (stone fragments),ashes and cinders which had buried whole valleys. Large portions of sizablehills had blown up or collapsed. Huge subterranean volcanic cauldrons andgigantic wall-like volcanic dykes were encountered. Blue, black and red bakedrocks abounded. Craters of every size were seen. Great expanses of pulverisedand carbonated rock were traversed and observations made of extensive beds ofcinders and ashes up to 40ft (12m) deep. Numerous large fissures and cracks,very significantly aligned north-west to south-east, had riven surface stratathroughout the region 83 . Near the Capim Branco basin, gigantic solidified'waves' of once molten lava were found. They had formerly been flowing acrossthe landscape as a vast fiery avalanche like, but infinitely greater than, knownmodern equivalents. One of the 'waves' had been arrested in mid-motion, itsupper portion hanging like a magnified crest of a breaking sea wave 84 .Although the heat emitted by such vulcan-ism must have been indescribable, itstill palesalongside that which must have accompanied the stupendous basaltic outpourings.The temperature of a fire fountain (like that in fig 5.10) repeatedly measuredon December 5th 1959 in Hawaii was consistently above 2050°F (1120°C), andactually reached 2200°F (1200°C) on one occasion 85 . The largest firefountains, incidentally, have been known to spurt upwards by as much as 1,000ft(308m) 86 . Fire fountains having similar temperatures must have been common inthese gigantic volcanic eruptions of the past.Like many of their modern analogues, these outpourings almost certainly occurredwith devastating violence and rapidity. Lava ejected by Mauna Loa on Hawaii in1855, for instance, moved at over 40mph (64kph), while, during the eruption ofthe Japanese volcano Bandai in 1888, one of its four peaks was blown off andalmost three billion tonnes of material were hurled skywards within just a fewminutes. Many of the 'late Pleistocene' volcanoes must have acted with similarspeed and violence.Even in modern eruptions, the volume of ejected matter is frequently immense. InDecember 1959, for example, the volcano Kilauea Iki on Hawaii at first spewedout lava at the enormous rate of 470,000 cubic yards (357,200m 2 ) per hour,later increasing this to 1,400,000 cu yds (1,064,000m 3 ) per hour 87 . A stillhigher hourly rate - 5,000,000 cu yds (3,800,000m'), or approximately 2,500,000tonnes - was attained by the volcano Mauna Loa in 1887 88 .Most popular and general scientific surveys of vulcanism refer to the tremendousvolcanic explosions of Krakatau in August 1883 and Mt Pelee in May 1902, whilein our own day accounts of the huge eruption of Mt St Helens in May 1980 havebeen published at all levels. These three events - of which the first two areclassics - have furnished abundant data about important subsidiary phenomenarespecting rock stiiations and huge displaced boulders. Fuller consideration ofthese is therefore especially instructive.Krakatau is a small volcanic island in the Sunda Strait separating Java andSumatra which, on August 26th 1883, erupted so loudly that it was audible 150miles (240km) awayThe whole night long Krakatau belched thick black smoke which, rent bycontinuous lightning flashes, eventually soared to a height of 87,750ft(27,000m).At approximately 10.00am the following day, however, there occurred the mostviolent natural disaster of modern times. Krakatau literally exploded with athunderous roar which was heard in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Philippines andJapan, over 3,000 miles (4,000km) away. Masses of rock measuring 5,200ft(1,600m) were flung as far distant as 100 miles (160km), and its shock waveswere registered by barographs all over the world. A tidal wave 32.5ft (10m) highrushed out from the island at the incredible speed of 350mph (560kph) in alldirections, reaching a height of 120ft (36m). It swamped Javanese and Sumatransettlements, in a matter of minutes completely demolishing 295 towns andvillages, and partially devastating 132 others. At least 5,000 ships and boatswere wrecked, or carried, toy-like, far inland. Acting in unison, blast andtidal wave killed some 36,000 peo-ple and numberless animals and plants almost instantly, while many others werebadly injured. The wave itself was distinctly felt at places as distant as PortElizabeth in South Africa and, as an abnormal swell, in the English Channel 89 .Enormous quantities of ejected ash and dust were blown far and wide. Regions upto 275 miles (440km) away were plunged into total darkness: 130 miles (208km)away the darkness continued unnaturally for 24 hours, and 50 miles (80km) awayfor as long as 57 hours. In the immediate neighbourhood of Krakatau it persistedfor three days and was so thick that nobody could see their hand before theirface 90 . 'Collapsed Sky' conditions had been produced. Dust from the explosionactually fell on ships 1,600 miles (2,560km) away, and for years remainedsuspended in the upper atmosphere causing spectacular sunsets. Pumice (lightbubbly volcanic rock) thickly covered the sea all round Krakatau, and shipsvisiting the area shortly afterwards reported how they had to plough their waythrough 10ft (3m) thick layers of it.picture73 [images/picture73.jpg]Fig 5.10. A fire-fountain.Innumerable tree trunks and animal and human corpses were embedded in it - adismal and sobering sight 1 \".It has been estimated that the main Krakatau explosion released energy in theorder of 7.2x10\" ergs (72 followed by 21 zeros), which is equivalent to thatproduced by an atom bomb of about 1.8 megatons'' 2 .Hardly less traumatic, and in some ways worse, was the appalling volcaniccataclysm involving Mt Pelee at the north tip of the island of Martinique, onThursday 8th May 1902. Shortly before 8.00am that day, when 28,000 inhabitantsof Saint Pierre nestling at the foot of Mt Pelee's southern slope were juststarting another day, and the harbour of this coastal town was full of shipping,Mt Pelee erupted with incredible violence. Initially, only minor explosionsshook the volcano, which threw mud and rocks about and rained heavy ash fallsover the surrounding countryside\" 3 . Later repeated blasts of gas andsuperheated steam shot with frightful intensity through fissures in thevolcano's flanks:...carrying with them vast quantities of glowing ash and blocks. So voluminouswere these ejecta that they fell at once on the adjacent slopes, then raced downthe mountain sides at hurricane speeds. Some of these glowing avalanches wereobserved to move at rates of more than 100 miles an hour. One overwhelmed thetown of Saint Pierre in an instant, killing all but one of its 28,000inhabitants.* 1 (Our italics).The lone survivor was a prisoner in a local jail! Almost everyone aboard thevessels in the harbour was similarly annihilated in a flash 95 , a mere 25 (outof a crew of 68) surviving on the steamer Roraima. Their collected depositionsrevealed that Mt Pelee had blown to pieces soon after 7.45am. One side of thevolcano had been ripped out completely, and a solid wall of flame had hurtledout at horrifying speed with a noise compared to thousands of simultaneouslydischarging cannon. A veritable fire-hurricane, it careered down the mountainand across Saint Pierre and its harbour. Saint Pierre was destroyed inan instant, leaving it singularly like the incinerated cities of Nagasaki andHiroshima in World War II (fig 5.11). On reaching the harbour, the fire-wavecaused the sea to boil and seethe and send up vast clouds of steam, ascoincidentally it burnt off masts and funnels of anchored ships. Indeed,Roraima's masts and smokestack looked as though they had been \"cut by a knife\"\"6 .Other recorded effects included the ejection of huge blocks of andesitic lava -some 15ft (4.6m) long 97 , and one 30x24x22ft (9x7x7m)\" 8 -flung as far asSeche-Blanche plateau 3 miles (4.8km) distant. Elsewhere, a bluff near Mt Peleeexhibited surface striations caused by sand-blast action which were practicallyindistinguishable from so-called 'glacial' striae\", while at Grande Riviere anextensive boulder-field formed by high speed mud-torrents was found. Allegedglacial boulder-fields are often very similar (figs 5.12, 5.13), while, as wehave seen, mud-slides sometimes produce rock striations 100 as well astransporting large rocks appreciable distances 1 \" 1 .Medical examination of the grotesque injuries on the dead were also instructive:In many instances the actual cause of death probably was the inhaling of thevery hot gas. The bodies were intensely burned, as also were those of thesurvivors. Many were stripped of clothing by the force of the blast; but othersremained clothed and the clothing was not ignited, even though the body beneathit was severely burned. Body tissue was distended, and in many instances skullsutures had been opened up. The injuries were such as would result from suddenheat intense enough to turn water in human tissue into steam, but not highenough or of long enough duration to raise fabrics to kindling temperature. 102.Though grisly, these details instantly recall the state of some of the animalremains excavated from several of the aforementioned bone-caves, and the Zunilegend describing how, at the time of Phaeton's visit, searing blasts heated theblood of huddling animals to the point where it gushed out of their bodies.Coincidences?Just one day earlier, La Soufriere on the island of St Vincent had also erupted.While not as devastating as the Martinique explosion, that of La Soufriere wasnevertheless violent and cataclysmic. It included a tremendous volcanic blastwhich felled and debarked numberless trees, and a rain of ashes so immense thatit filled a local gorge to a depth of 200ft (61.5m). Sand-blasted trees,resembling some found in 'drift' gravels elsewhere, were among its other victims103 .When Mt Pelee erupted again between 1929 and 1932, geological teams rushed toMartinique to study how some of the scientifically unobserved 1902 effects hadbeen achieved, interesting discoveries resulted. Enormous lava boulders werefound 3 miles (5km) from the main crater, not flung there by blast ortransported by mud-torrents, but carried aerially by nuees ardentes -gas-charged vapour emitted explosively from the volcano. Perret described theprocess as follows:At the moment of explosion liquid masses of lava, instead of being hurled highinto theair to form bombs, are converted more or less completely into ash by the rapiddischarge of gas, and with the ash are carried along ejectamenta of all sizes:blocks, boulders... highly heated but not fused. Of such materials are the nueesardentes composed, and no matter how heterogeneous in size they may be, all arederived from the same mass of lava... The vapour density about the separateparticles is so great that blocks and boulders... are buoyed up and carriedforward like corks. 104 .The force and velocity of these nuees ardentes were frequently so great that,not only did they carbonise trees, but underlying rock surfaces were scarified(incised or stripped) and striated very much in the manner of alleged glacialaction. Such effects were noticed at several places, especially at the base ofMorne Lenard near Mt Pelee. The close similarities between striations ofvolcanic and supposed glacial origin was noticed as long ago as 1909, when itwas established that, given sufficient power and speed, grit-charged volcanicsteam couldpicture74 [images/picture74.jpg]Fig 5.11. Saint Pierre, Martinique, shortly after the Mont Pelee fire-hurricanehad devastated it on May 8th 1902. Photo: Brown Brothers, Sterling,Pennsylvania, by permission.quickly excavate U-shaped valleys in solid rock. One such valley was cut by thisprocess during the 1902 eruption of Mt Pelee 105 .On December 4th 1951, Hibokhibok volcano in the Philippines duplicated MtPelee's 1902 performance on a somewhat smaller but still catastrophic scale. Amighty explosion released a gigantic avalanche of red-hot lava enveloped in\"writhing clouds of stifling gas and hot dust\" which:...swept silently and lethally over the villages just north of Mambajao and, ina few moments, took the lives of 500 persons. Houses were burned and bodies ofpersons and animals were charred and mummified. The blast accompanying theavalanche knocked down trees and aligned them parallel to the direction ofmovement of the avalanche. Three miles from the summit of the mountain the forceof the blast was sufficient to wrap the trunk of a coconut tree 5in in diameterin the form of a U around the trunk of a big mango tree. 106 (Our italics).The extraordinary effects of directed volcanic blast have also been noticed inRussia, particularly in connection with the eruption of Mt Shiveluch 107 .The recent Mt St Helens eruption provided further evidence of the near-instantdevastation possible by just one large volcanic outburst. Exhaustively publishedelsewhere 108 , the details need not be repeated here, although reference shouldcertainly be made to the vast number of trees felled by incredibly powerfulfast-moving blast clouds, and to the huge pyroclastic ash and mud-torrentsenveloping enormous log jams \"...that resemble those deposited by water\". Theresultant deposits with their woody contents are reminiscent of the Alaskan'muck' beds and the Siberian 'wood hills' which contain trees like thosecarbonised by Mt Pelee.These modern examples of vulcanism demonstrate that many, if not all, of theagents capable of causing phenomena supposedly typical of the alleged'Pleistocene' glaciations are to be found in them.

This, of course, does not imply that vulcanism was exclusivelyresponsible for all the alleged 'Pleistocene' glacial effects.Unquestionably various other agents also contributed to their generation.Nonetheless, considering the extent and severity of vulcanism at the end ofso-called 'Pleistocene' times, and the apparent absence then of large scale iceaction globally, it is more than probable that at least some alleged 'glacial'effects were due to volcanic agencies.Numerous independent tribal recollections of a frightful world holocausttraditionally attributed to one or more cosmic agents were marshalled in PartThree. Very significantly, these memories are entirely consistent with the typeof scenario which the volcanic and Earth fracture evidence just reviewedunmistakably suggests. Many accounts provide exception-ably graphic descriptionsof a raging inferno. In the North American Wintun legend, for example, the hero,Olelbis, allegedly:...looked down into the burning world. He could see nothing but waves of flame;rocks were burning, the ground was burning, everything was burning. Great rollsand piles of smoke were rising; fire flew up towards the sky in flames, in greatsparks and brands... The great fire was blazing, roaring all over the earth,burning rocks, trees, people, burning everything... 109 .The Mbocobi tribe of South America recall that when the Sun once fell down fromthe sky it set the world alight in a \"deluge of fire\" 110 . The Norse Volusparecounts how the cosmic assailant Surt: \"...comes from the south with ...fire\".In the stanza which describes earth sinking into the sea, it is said that \"steamrages... fire shoots high to heaven itself...\" 1 \".Surt, who, with the Midgard Serpent and the Fenris-Wolf, figures prominently inthe Ragnarok epic:...remains (in the sky) to the last, to fling fire over the whole world, so thatthe race of men perishes with the gods, and all are finally engulfed in theoverwhelming sea; the Sun becomes dark, Earth sinks in the sea, the shiningstars slip out of the sky. Vapour and fire rage fiercely together, till theleaping flame licks heaven itself. 112 .Ovid, in his account of Phaeton's flight close to Earth, tells how Phaeton\"...beholds the world set on fire on all sides...\" m (our italics) and how, atthat time, all the great rivers of the world either dried up or were turned tosteam. The Washo Indians of California recollect a tremendous terrestrialconvulsion which up-heaved whole mountain ranges in blazing fire, the flamesrising to such heights that \"...the stars of heaven melted and fell upon theEarth. Then the sierras rose up from the plain...\" 114 .Closely similar events are mentioned in the Old German Apocalypse, the Muspilli,in its account of the reputed conflict between Elijah and Satan (Phaeton):...the mountains begin to belch forth fire, no tree remains unscathed upon theland, the waters dry up, the sea disappears, the heavens begin to burn in a dullflame, the Moon falls, the Earth is on fire, no stone remains upon another. 115.These are not simply memories of unusually severe vulcanism, although volcaniceruptions are featured, but accounts of infinitely worse conditions: occasionswhen yawning chasms in a fractured and dislocated lithosphere permittedstupendous volumes of molten magma to well up and overspread adjacentlandscapes; when great portions of the Earth's crust buckled and folded amidfountains of fire and superheated steam as new mountain ranges were up-heavedand existing ones elevated still higher; and when other portions collapsed andfell away into fiery cauldrons of prodigious size. Accompanying such hellishevents, fire, lava, cinders, ashes and gases shot skywards to immense heights inrepeated explosions of unimaginable ferocity, transcending even those ofKrakatau and Tambora. Many erup-tions would have given the impression of reaching 'heaven itself.These recollections also plainly state that the entire world, not just someparticular region, caught fire: \"everything was burning\", \"fire on all sides\",\"roaring all over the earth\", and so on. A universal conflagration, however, isprecisely what would have occurred if the terrestrial crust was extensivelyfractured andbuckled by an irresistible force; and only an external force could have achievedsuch disruption.Still closer consideration of the thermal aspect of this disaster indicates theoperation of yet another highly destructive agent - wind of super hurricaneforce. It was a major element in this appalling Fire-storm, and must now claimour attention.Hurricanet-^sjKb?its?zzr~*Inevitably, tremendous winds generated by the various factors discussedpreviously blew with mind-boggling force and velocity over much of the world.Even the worst modern typhoons, cyclones, hurricanes and tornadoes palealongside the winds that must have been unleashed then. Their destructive poweralmost surpasses comprehension, and today they have no direct parallels. It isnot, however, difficult to appreciate their effect upon the worldwide fires wehave just been considering.Here, we survey some of the yet extant data - physical and traditional -apparently relating to the former reality of these winds, and attempt to assesstheir significance during the Phaeton disaster.We begin by recalling the remarkable accumulation of diverse avian species(birds) entombed in Tate Pleistocene' deposits in California, and the equallyheterogeneous mass of plant and animal remains in the similarly-aged lignitebeds at Geiseltal in Germany. These assemblages can only have been congregatedat these places by furious winds or wildly surging water, or by both thoseagents acting in unison.The destructive capacity of continuous winds has long been known, those ladenwith dust or grit being especially acute.Concerning the effects of sand-charged winds, Dana once remarked:The sands carried by winds when passing over rocks sometimes wear them smooth,or cover them with scratches and furrows, as observed by W P Blake on graniterocks at the Pass of San Bernardino, in California... Limestone was so much wornas to look as if the surface had been removed by solution. Similar effects havebeen observed by Winchell in the Grand Traverse region of Michigan...\" 6 (Ouritalics).Almost all observers of 'drift' - that singular formation considered at lengthin Part One -have commented on its generally unstratified and chaoticappearance. Geikie spoke of it as having a \"confused and tumultuous\" appearance\"7 , adding that the intercalated beds in it:...are twisted, bent, crumpled and confused often in the wildest manner. Layersof clay, sand and gravel... are puckered into folds and sharply curved intovertical positions. The intercalated beds are everywhere cut through by theoverlying 'till', and... in the mass of the 'till' itself fossils sometimes, butvery rarely, occur, and fragments of wood have from time to time been discov-ered. They almost invariably afford marks of having been subjected to the sameaction as the stones and bowlders by which they are surrounded. nK (Ouritalics).Only an agency operating indiscriminately and universally, or a combination ofsuch agents acting coincidentally, could have produced results of this kind.Indeed, it was, as Dana once stated, a process which deposited the 'drift'\"pell-mell\"\" 1 '. Its distribution is also peculiar, for, speaking of thatportion of it known as 'boulder clay', another authority described how:The true bowlder-clay is spread out over the region... as a somewhat widelyextended but uniform sheet, yet it may be said to fill up small valleys anddepressions, and to be thin or absent on ridges or rising ground. 120This singular distribution is comparable to snow accumulations driven by highwinds.Many have admitted that the 'drift' was deposited under violent conditions whichaffected vast areas simultaneously 121 . Others, like Figuier 122 , haverecognised that the event was sudden and somehow connected with a change in theinclination of the Earth's axis 123 - by now an all too familiar theme. Thisviolence of deposition, and its apparent similarity of operation over hugeregions, not only explains the unstratified and tumultuous appearance of much ofthe 'drift', but is in direct contrast to the slow, if inexorable, action of iceto which its origin is usually ascribed. All-embracing agents capable of actingviolently and suddenly are required to account for the observable phenomena.Only water and wind possess those capacities.The 'boulder clay' was almost certainly viscous when first deposited. Prior toattaining that consistency, however, it had existed on the original land surfaceas sand and soil particles which, from the earliest stages of the catastropheonwards, were frequently disturbed by lightning strikes and heavily augmented byprodigious falls of volcanic ashand dust produced by the ever-increasing vulcanism. Super-cyclonic windssubsequently whirled up all this material from the pre-catastrophic landscape,depositing it as a great dusty mantle over hill and dale alike. Shortlyafterwards it was converted into a great muddy paste by the Deluge waters whichredistributed it tumultuously where we now find it. As we shall soon see, theDeluge was not long in materialising and apparently commenced its activitieswell before the super-winds were eventually dissipated. It was the combinationof water and wind which bodily moved the 'drift' across the convulsed landscape.That much of the 'drift' was deposited in this manner is indicated by thepresence in it, in many places, of upright tree stumps with their roots stillfirmly embedded in the original soils underlying the 'drift'. These stumpsprotrude upwards into the basal layers of the 'drift'. Had ice deposited the'drift', then these stumps would have been obliterated. They were not.Thus, terrible winds, whistling round the world, swept up masses of loosesurface material and fanned the conflagration already in progress as the resultof plate tectonics and rampant vulcanism engendered by the rotational and axialchanges. The results were horrendous.It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that descriptions of these stupendouswinds feature in the ancient recollections of almost every nation ofconsequence. It was a wind without parallel - and, because it occurred at thetime of the cosmic assailant Phaeton, was accorded a cosmic origin. This notionof a 'cosmic' wind is reiterated again and again in the Persian Avesta m , inthe Hindu Vedas, in the Babylonian Talmud, and by many authors of antiquity. Itwas also known as the 'diluvium venti' - the deluge of wind 12 '' - and wasexpressly attributed by the ancient Mesopotamians to Marduk (Phaeton) which issaid to have:...created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane, and the fourfoldwind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the wind which has noequal. 126 .In the Gilgamesh epic the duration of the wind is given as : \"...six days and anight... the hurricane, deluge and tempest continued sweeping the land\" 127 .The wind is described as a whirlwind or cyclone of unimaginable ferocity. We aretold that: \"The whirlwind of Adad swept up to heaven\" 128 , and was so awesomethat even \"The gods were terrified at the cyclone\" 129 .Rabbinical records provide essentially the same information. They assert thatthe wind endured unabated for seven days and that it was accompanied by adarkness so intense that people did not stir from their homes and refuges duringthat period 130 .The pre-Columbian Maya records describe how these frightful winds demolished alltowns, swept away whole forests, moved great rocks, and blew away entire hills'31 , the latter, no doubt, being sand-hills or earthy mounds. The winds wereregarded as the wrath of the Mayan god Hurakan, whose name, later corrupted to'hurricane', was ever afterwards associated with winds of exceptional force andprolonged violence.The Mayan claim that this super-cyclone moved giant rocks is, somewhatsurprisingly, consistent with fact. Fig 5.14 shows one such rock which wasthrown up a cliff about 39ft (12m) high and carried inland a further 97ft (30m),before being turned upside down by a hurricane which recently visited the eastcoast of Barbados 132 . Many further similar modern instances are known.Certainly large rocks can be, and are, moved by exceptional winds. Thosecomprising the 'diluvium venti' were more than exceptional.Maori traditions connect this dreadful aeo-lian derangement with a giganticcataclysm which permanently submerged an ancestral Pacific homeland. Thesedescribe them as: \"...the mighty winds, the fierce squalls, the clouds, dense,dark, fiery, wildly drifting, wildly bursting\" 133 , which swept away vastforests and lashed the ocean waters into mountain-high waves.It scarcely needs emphasising that this 'diluvium venti' created a tremendousdin. Many traditions expressly refer to the appalling racket accompanying theCon-:> V*picture76 [images/picture76.jpg]■■MiFig 5.13.

Interestingly,the native North Americans link the winds and the noise they made with acelestial monster (Phaeton) which passed across the heavens near Earth, with:...a whistle in his mouth; as he moved forward he blew with all his might, andmade a terrible noise... He came flowing and blowing; he looked like an enormousbat with wings spread. 134 .Marduk, which allegedly unleashed an 'evil wind' and 'fierce storm winds' todestroy Tiamat (see Part Four), evidently repeated the process when, in itsguise as Phaeton, it confronted Earth at the time of the Noachian Deluge.The absolute power of concentrated wind is often not sufficiently comprehended,especially in regions normally not experiencing it. It is, however, devastating.At Salt Creek, Iowa, for example, hurricane force winds on June 12th 1881 liftedcattle high into the air and flung them violently back onto the ground, killingthem outright. Leaves on adjacent vegetation were withered as \"by the heat of afire\". Simultaneously, stands of timber in Nevada were flattened and tree trunkshurled 500ft (153m) away, while a heavy goods train was blown off a nearbyrailroad track 135 .Regarding the unfortunate cattle of Salt Creek, one can appreciate how animalssimilarly exterminated during Phaeton's visit might be buried whole, theirconstituent bones broken or fractured internally but held in place by muscles,sinews and flesh externally; and how modern finds in 'drift' deposits of suchbones with all the fragments still in relative position (but with the formerlysurrounding flesh and soft tissues decayed away) perplex those still adhering toconventional 'Ice Age' concepts. In Part Two many such finds were noted, clearlyindicating that whole animals had been interred coincidentally with thedeposition of the 'drift'. Moreover, in view of the previously suggested aeolianinvolvement in the tumultuous deposition of the 'drift', it is not surpris-ing that organic remains found in it were apparently subjected to the sameaction as the deposits enveloping them Mh .The Maori reference to 'fiery' winds seemingly alludes, at least in part, toairborne billows of ignited gases and a general fanning of the tremendousconflagration already raging then across much of the world. As we shall now see,it is a detail consistent with what must have happened at numerous localities.Such huge fires - which at their height may have attained sub-continental extent- would themselves have created acute fire-storm conditions by sucking in airfrom surrounding regions on a retort basis. This is a well known aspect ofparticularly severe fires, and has been documented in connection with prairiefires, volcanic eruptions and giant fires in cities. A brief look at some ofthese provides telling glimpses of what occurred on Earth immediately before theonset of the Deluge.Wind rushing in from all sides to fan 200ft (61.5m) high flames generated duringa field fire at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in 1783, were strong enough to liftlarge cut trees 50-60ft (15-18m) above the ground 137 . Other similar cases areknown.The bombing in World War II of Hamburg, Germany, on the night of July 27th 1943,led to an appalling fire-storm which raged on into the next day. Three yearslater exhaustive investigations pieced together the tragedy. Very dry weatherconditions had preceded the bombing, and contributed greatly to the 'success' ofthe fire. The exceptional number of bombs dropped upon the city started so manyfires simultaneously that a column of heated air, 11 miles (2.4km) in diameterand 21 miles (4km) high, formed above the centre of the fire 138 . Temperaturesinside this fire area reached 800°C 139 . The water in the canals and port ofHamburg heated to the point where they were \"hardly bearable\" 140 . Thesedetails are strongly reminiscent of what occurred during Mt Pelee's 1902destruction of Saint Pierre, when the fire-wave had melted glass (650-700°C) butnot copper (1,058°C) and the harbour waters had boiled and steamed 141 .The Hamburg fires produced air turbulence fed by ground surface winds in-rushingfrom surrounding districts to replace those drawn up by the rising column ofheated air. One and a half miles (2.4km) from the central fire area wind speedsvaried from ll-33mph (18-53kph), whereas near the centre they reached typhoonstrength, uprooted trees of all sizes and blew people off their feet. At first,the typhoon \"...moved into the direction of the fires, later spreading in alldirections\" 142 . People perished not so much from exploding bombs or actualincineration but from the rapid loss or contamination of the atmosphere. Heatstroke, suffocation due to a lack of oxygen, carbon monoxide poisoning andinhalation of dust were among the causes established 143 . Unquestionably windplayed the most critical role in this tragedy and, as the principal cause ofatmospheric derangement and pollution, increased the final death toll far beyondthat which could have been initially anticipated.Almost precisely similar circumstances attended the even worse fire-storm thatdestroyed Chicago in 1871. Its horrors were carefully chronicled by Sheahan andUpton in their classic account of the event published within weeks of thecalamity 144 . Although grim, their text sheds considerable light on the kind offiery phenomena generated by Phaeton's visit. Tornado strength winds fanned thefire so fiercely that iron, granite, bricks and glass were melted and fusedtogether in grotesque conglomerates, as if all had passed through ablast-furnace. Athens marble, which had been used to adorn certain cityedifices, burned like common fuel 145 . The fire also doubled on its track atthe Great Union Depot, and burned half a mile southward in the very teeth of thegale - a gale which blew a perfect tornado 146 . Anothernotable feature of this fire was its cleansing capacity:The most striking peculiarity of the fire was its intense heat. Nothing exposedto it escaped. Amid the hundreds of acres left bare there is not one to be foundwith a piece of wood of any description, and, unlike most fires, it left nothinghalf burned... The fire swept the streets of all the ordinary dust and rubbish,consuming it instantly 147 .Sufficient data has been presented to show the devastating role of concentratedwind when combined with fire. On its own, fire is bad enough, and if winds arelight or nonexistent it can be contained. Accompanied by strong or gale forcewinds, however, fire becomes uncontrollable. It becomes rampant - windexacerbates it. And when it attains the fury of a fire-storm, performs aremarkable cleansing role.At this late date we can merely try to imagine what the great Conflagration ofPhaeton's day must have been like. The mind almost refuses to accommodate allthe interrelated relevant factors, while the sheer scale of it encourages themind to recoil from a picture so terrifying as to be numbing. Frightful thoughthey were, the Mt Pelee fire-wave, the Hamburg fire-storm, and the great Chicagofire were miniature events when compared with Phaeton's Conflagration. Wholecontinents were on fire with flames that we are told \"reached to heaven\".Certainly it was the worst holocaust ever experienced by humankind. And winds ofstaggering force and power were a part of it, just as they seem to have beenduring the Deluge which, following hard on the heels of the Conflagration,extinguished it.Bombardmentrv*»-*»*±S*sr»It is surprising to discover on the gentle terrain of the Atlantic CoastalPlain, with no concealing cover or topography, one of the Earth's most immense,spectacular and intriguing topographical phenomena. Seen from the air theCarolina bays are an astounding, unforgettable revelation. But though hundredsof thousands lie clearly visible, scattered across the Atlantic Coastal Plainfrom Maryland into northern Florida, they are often all but unrecognisable tothe uninitiated eyes of groundlings. 148 .So wrote Henry Savage jr in his recent study of these extraordinary groundfeatures which, although most abundant near or along the Atlantic coast, alsooccur far inland 149 . They almost certainly occur, too, as submerged structureson the adjacent Atlantic continental shelf. The term 'Carolina Bays' is thus amisnomer: they are not bays and extend far beyond Carolina. First mentioned in1847, when comparatively few were noted 150 , the true distribution of theseshallow crater-like depressions was not appreciated until the 1930s followingthe advent of aerial photography. Today about half a million 'bays', bothcomplete and vestigial, have been recorded. Of these: \"...140,000 arelarge-to-medium sized, having lengths of more than 500ft\" 151 . Their shapes arealso particularly intriguing, for:...Although most bays approximate an elliptical shape, they vary greatly inelliptic-ity. Generally, the smaller the bay the more nearly round it becomes.Although there are numerous bays that are almost perfect ellipses, thevariations from that geometrical perfection are many and diverse. Often bays areasymmetrical, their north-east sides being significantly more curved than theirsouth-west sides... More frequent vari-ations from elliptical perfection are the ovate bays. These egg-shaped bayslikewise vary greatly among themselves, running the gamut from extremelyelongated ones to some almost circular in shape. Among the ovate bays markedgeographical correlations have been observed. As one moves south-westwardly fromthe South Carolina-North Carolina border bays tend to become increasingly ovatein shape. A similar tendency appears as one moves west across the coastal plain.152Respecting their sizes and distribution:...There are some immense bays such as Big Swamp Bay... in central SouthCarolina, nearly four miles long. In striking contrast some of its tinyneighbours are only three or four hundred feet long... Very large bays occurmostly in the area of bay concentration in south-east North Carolina andnorth-east South Carolina. They become markedly less frequent the farther theyare from that region. So too does the rate of bay occurrence diminish, and whenthey do occur in the most distant areas they usually appear in groups widelyseparated from other groups. 153Although like several other authors Velikovsky boldly stated that: \"...Aremarkable feature of these depressions is their parallelism: the long axis ofeach of them extends from north-west to south-east...\" 154 . This commentactually applies to comparatively few 'bays', since, overall, their alignmentvaries considerably and does so systematically on a geographical basis. Forexample:Bays in the area of the border between the Carolinas display a generally north-west/south-east orientation. However, as one moves up the coast there is atendency for bays to become more and more easterly in orientation, until inMaryland they approach an east-west direction. Likewise, as one moves down thecoastal plain the 'bays' long axes tend to rotate in a clockwise direction,until those found in south Georgia generally display an almost north-southorientation. A similar effect can be observed as one moves from east to west.155 .The significance of this important fact, which clearly relates to the cause ofthe formation of the 'bays', will be discussed later. Various explanations forthe formation of these curious structures have been proposed down the years. Theearliest advocated a combination of artesian springs and wind action 156 .Another argued that the 'bays' possibly evolved from drowned valleys blocked bysandbars when the coastal plain hosting them emerged from the sea 157 , while athird postulated that they possibly resulted from a process of natural solutionof sandy sediments 158 . Studies of the 'bays' in the Carolinas suggested toMelton 15 \" and others 160 that they probably represented ancient meteor scarsdating from 'late Pleistocene' ('Ice Age') times 161 .Other explanations involved supposed gyroscopic eddy effects 162 , air shockwaves generated by aerially-exploding meteors 163 , giant prehistoric fishspawning-beds 164 , the action of dust devils 165 and stranded icebergs 166 .Another hypothesis 167 suggested that the 'bays' were made by a comet whichcrashed into the eastern United States long ago. We now know, of course, thateven large comets apparently lack sufficient mass to cause crustal damage likethat represented by the 'Carolina bays'. More feasible, however, was thesuggestion that the 'bays' were of meteoric origin 168 , especially asmagnetometer studies of them in North Carolina hinted that buried meteoriticdebris existed in association with those structures. Previously it had beennoted that unusually high concentrations of meteorites existed inland from themain 'bays' area (map 5C), and in 1952 this was stressed as good evidence ofsuch an origin 16 \".Yet whatever the cause of the formation of the 'bays', it must have beenextensive, sudden and violent. Not long ago, the high probability of this cameto light in a lengthy farm drainage trench dug near Camden, South Carolina,which, at an average depth of 14ft (4.3m), exposed masses of prostrate trees atits base. Many were of large size and all indicated the former occurrence of asudden \"massive blow-down\" 170 . If the 'bays' are low-level aerial blasteffects, then, granted that the ancient landscape was well forested, theoccurrence of calamitously-felled timber in their immediate vicinity could notonly be expected but would be consistent with such an explanation.Interestingly, Henry Savage jr, the latest investigator of these 'bays', hasalso advocated a celestial cause for their origin, placing that event at the endof the 'mammoth' age ('late Pleistocene' times in conventional chronology), anage which, we have already seen, terminated abruptly and violently everywhereduring Phaeton's visit. If the conclusions of Savage and others like him arecorrect, then the Carolina 'bays' might very well represent yet further physicalreminders of the Phaeton disaster.The likelihood that numerous similar 'bays' lie submerged on the continentalshelf east of the Carolinas has encouraged investigations of what may be animmense impact crater on the floor of the Atlantic near Bermuda. A collisionbetween Earth and a gigantic meteor has been suggested as the origin of thisdrowned feature, described by Kelly and Dachaille as follows:This great undersea crater has a rim that stretches for hundreds of miles in agreat circle beginning at a point north and east of Puerto Rico and curving pastthe Bahamas, the Carolina coast, and north and east along the Atlantic coastuntil it loses itself in the deep ocean off the New England coast. There is avery sudden break, almost a cliff, where the continental shelf (crater rim)breaks off into the deep ocean. The Bahama Islands form the south wall of thiscrater. They rise only a few feet above sea level but they form an underseacliff that is nearly 700 miles long.

Aerial view of some of the oriented lakes near Point Barrow, Alaska.With permission of the Univ of Chicago andRSL, Oxford.Haiti, there is a secondary channel that is nearly half as deep as the maincrater basin. The islands of Cuba, Haiti and Puerto Rico are the mountains thatform the remains of the outer crater rim, and the Brownson and Bartlett Deepsare the down-warped troughs that are common to many of the other great collisionpoints that we shall mention later.The floor of this great impact crater is also consistent with what might beexpected. It slopes in every direction from the central peak (Bermuda) graduallygrowing deeper toward the rim, although it averages deeper on the south andsouth-west than it does on the north. It is somewhat ovoid in shape, beinglonger from north-east to south-west; the distance from Bermuda to Cape Hatterasbeing about 600 miles and from Bermuda to the Bahamas about 750 miles... TheBermuda central peak is surrounded on all sides by deep ocean, reaching a depthof 2,500 fathoms within a few miles from shore. From this point it graduallydeepens outwardly in all directions for about 300miles where it levels off and continues at about the same depth until it meetsthe sudden rise of the crater wall. This wall averages nearly 17,000ft and inplaces more than 18,000ft and this in a distance of no more than 15 or 20 miles.If one could remove the water and stand on the bottom of this crater one wouldlook up at a mountain wall almost three times as high as the Grand Canyon isdeep, and almost as steep. The deepest part of the crater lies at the end of theBahama chain and athwart the Mona Passage between Haiti and Puerto Rico. This isthe Brownson Deep which is 4,780 fathoms or 28,680ft. It is a comparativelynarrow trench... and probably indicates a down-warping of the crust or anin-falling of molten magma at the time of the collision. 171 .As direct observations are inevitably limited, it is presently impossible topositively assert that the above structures do collectively represent an ancientimpact crater. Nevertheless, the known physical evidence is decidedlythought-provoking, and it must be noteworthy that it is located eastward of thegeneral area of the Carolina 'bays'. Furthermore, it would indeed be remarkableif entirely separate events, possibly spanning millions of years, contrived toplace in such close geographical juxtaposition sets of major topographicalfeatures forming a seemingly natural west-to-east sequence - an area of prolificsmall meteorites progressing via abundant larger 'bays' to an immense craterlikestructure - suggestive of one or more impacting cosmic bodies.The Carolina 'bays', however, are not entirely unique. Similar concentrations oforiented shallow depressions ('lakes') exist on the Alaskan permafrost nearPoint Barrow - and, like their southern analogues, they are mostly alignednorth-west to south-east. They also extend, or must have once extended,northwards across the floor of the Arctic Ocean.Oval, elliptical, or greatly elongated in shape (no circular examples are known)they number many thousands and cover more than 25,000 sq miles (64,750km 2 ). Insize, they range from 9 miles (14.4km) long and 3 miles (4.8km) wide to 1 mile(1.6km) or less long and 1 mile (0.8km) or less wide. Some are water-filled, butothers are quite dry, the latter revealing that many depressions overlap uponone another and must have been created successively (see fig 5.15). Veryinterestingly, a 'late Pleistocene' or early Holocene date has been suggestedfor these features 172 .Early studies of these 'lakes' concluded that many, if not all of them,represented land surface 'cave-ins' resulting from the thawing of otherwisepermanently frozen ground 173 . 'Caving', however, cannot produce extensiveregional orientation or cause apparently newer 'lakes' to impinge on older (andpresumably 'caved-in') 'lakes'. Only some aerial cause could produce sucheffects.These 'lakes' bear close comparison not only with others in the Harrison Bayarea of Alaska, where they are also aligned north-west to south-east 174 , andon the Old Crow Plain (west of the Mackenzie Valley) in Yukon, Canada 175 , butalso with others believed to be of Quaternary age in the valleys of the Penzhinaand Anadyr rivers in north-eastern Siberia 176 .These latter reportedly vary in diameter from several hundred feet to as much as3 miles (5km), are generally oblong or elongated, and are remarkably shallow.Nor should we forget that, as previously remarked, shallow, swampy 'lakes' closeto the north Siberian mammoth graveyards are stated to have been formed underexceptional circumstances.Rather unexpectedly, a further group of over 200 shallow 'lakes', also generallyaligned north-west to south-east, covers more than 45,000 sq miles (116,550km 2) of the Beni region of north-eastern Bolivia in South America. In size, theyrange from about 1,000ft square (307m 2 ) to 5.4 by 12.4 miles (8.6 x 20km).Again, some are water-filled, others are dry. Most exhibit rectilinear or ovalshapes, although a few irregular shaped examples also exist. The oval 'lakes'are particularly noteworthy for having one rim more developed than the others,exactly as in many of the Carolina 'bays' and the Old Crow Plain 'lakes' (seetable 5B), and, as with many of those structures, also lack stream inlets oroutlets 177 .The arguments advanced to account for the Carolina 'bays', and the oriented'lakes' of Canada, Alaska and Siberia, which call for ice, 'cave-ins', or thecollapse of portions of ancient buried valleys, scarcely apply in tropicalBolivia, yet, the South American examples are seemingly explicable by a singleevent responsible for all these remarkable geographically scattered features.Oval crater-like ground structures, closely resembling th Carolina 'bays' alsoexist in the Netherlands, where they are, however, far less obvious than theirAmerican counterparts through having been largely obscured by agricultural andconstructional activities 178 . Significantly, many erratic boulders composed ofrocks not now found closer than Finland and Scandinavia occur near thesedepressions, the long axes of which, moreover, are predominantly north-northwestto south-southeast.At Tapanui, north of Invercargill at the southeastern end of South Island, NewZealand, an extensive, largely triangular area is notable for yielding unusualquantities of small metallic fragments and stony objects known locally as'China-stones'. The latter contain carbonisedpicture79 [images/picture79.jpg]Table 5BComparison of the Alaskan lakes, the Carolina 'bays' and the Beni Basin, Bolivia(After Plafker G.

Hand-held compasses alsoregularly behave wildly in this area.In combination, these details raise the possibility that this is another areaover which a large aerial explosion (like those suggested as the causeunderlying the creation of the Carolina 'bays') occurred in 'late Pleistocene'times - a date agreeing remarkably well with the 11,500 years BP date advocatedin this book for the Phaeton disaster. In this case, however, no shallow-rimmedcraters were formed. Rather interestingly, however, Maori traditions refer to animmense aerial detonation occurring over South Island long ago, when a hugehorned celestial object, \"glowinglike the Moon\", split apart and crashed to Earth, causing widespreaddevastation.In 1951, Kelly 179 suggested that the Carolina 'bays', the supposed Bermuda'crater' and the oriented 'lakes' around Barrow Point all originated during'late Pleistocene' times through Earth's collision with a giant meteor or seriesof meteors, which jolted the terrestrial pole from an older position centred onApatak Island in Ungava Bay, Quebec, to its present location. While we do notnecessarily agree with this theory, it is nevertheless a most interesting one.All the aforementioned structures lie along a single curving course. If we addthe Russian, Harrison Bay and Old Crow Plainpicture80 [images/picture80.jpg]Map 5E. Possible polar flight-paths of disintegrating aerial objectstheoretically responsible for oriented lakes, Carolina'bays' and an alleged crater on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean at the time ofthe Phaeton disaster. The recentlydiscovered 'craters' at Duolon (A) and the Amirantes area of the Indian Oceanare not necessarily any part of theevents depicted on this map. Their locations, however, suggest that someassociation may exist. Accordingly, theirsuggested pre-impact flight-paths are shown dotted. Partially based on Kelly andDachaille.sets of oriented 'lakes' to Kelly's map we find that they too generally straddlethe same curving course. Dare we accept this coincidence? The overall impressionreceived is that of some large disintegrating body near-ing the Earth on acurved trajectory over the northern hemisphere, and of pieces of it breaking offen route and striking the ground or exploding a short distance aboveground-level at those places where the above-noted 'bays', 'lakes' and supposed'crater' now occur as reviewed by Silver and Schuttz. 16 'Using the reported alignments of the Bolivian and Dutch structures, it is alsopossible to interpret them as analogous effects, created by related pieces ofthe same disintegrating object, ending their careers overBolivia and the Netherlands respectively (see map 5E). Certainly the long listof similarities between all these topographical features (table 5B) stronglysuggests that they shared a common origin. Indeed, how many coincidences aretolerable before definite causal connection between these topographical featuresbecomes irrefutable?Exciting though such an interpretation may seem, does it really reflect realityor even the sequence of events which can be inferred as having probablycomprised that phase of the Phaeton catastrophe? The testimony of tradition,representing the only surviving eye-witness record of that terrible event,supplies several interesting clues partly answering this question.8Hell on Earthe^s^fe.jiijii^-4No matter which account we study, the principal assailant in the great cosmicdrama under discussion is almost always stated to have been accompanied byseveral lesser but highly destructive 'attendants'. The Babylonian accountprovides the assailant Marduk with four 'assistants' early in his wanderingsamongst the outer planets. Later, after the battle with Tiamat, it reportedlyacquired Tiamat's satellite Kingu as well as dismembered pieces of Tiamat too.By the time Marduk (Phaeton) neared Earth it did so in company with quite anentourage of lesser objects.Likewise, the Midgard Serpent of Norse tradition was attended by theFenris-Wolf, Garm, Surt and Loke; while in the Bundahish, Tistrya is accompaniedby the Pairikas or 'worm-stars' and the 'angels' Vohuman, Horn and Burg 18 \".The solar horses, which in Greek legend pull Phaeton's fiery chariot, is apoetic way of saying that fieryand effulgent objects accompanied and preceded it through the heavens. Biblicaltexts mention an 'evil host' accompanying Satan or the dragon during the 'war inHeaven', while the Vedic hymns of ancient India describe Indra (Phaeton) astravelling across the firmament with a band of destructive entities known asMaruts, who are repeatedly described as 'blazing', 'brilliant with fire','shining like snakes' (with long trailing tails), the 'terrible ones' and the'shakers of Heaven and Earth' 181 .Such traditions clearly record that several fiery or luminous objects arrivedsimultaneously in the neighbourhood of Earth at the time of the Phaetondisaster, and that these were largely subordinate to Phaeton irrespective of thename by which Phaeton was locally remembered.As the following excerpts suggest, it was widely believed that several if notall of these unwelcome visitors crashed down uponEarth to be buried deep below its surface in a vast chasm - which later came tobe regarded as Hell itself. Describing this event, the Book of Revelationinforms us:And there was a war in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon,and the dragon fought with his angels. And prevailed not; neither was theirplace found any more in Heaven. And the dragon was cast out... he was cast intothe Earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 182The same source provides further details about what can only have been a cosmicbombardment during the course of this 'war', and refers to various other effectsconsidered previously. We are told that first there was \"silence in Heaven aboutthe pace of half an hour\" 181 . This was succeeded by \"thunder-ings andlightnings, and an earthquake\" 184 , after which the Earth was showered by \"hailand fire mingled with blood\" 185 , which consumed trees and grass. Then a \"greatmountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the seabecame blood\", which, evidently poisoning the waters, occasioned widespread lossof marine life 186 .This event was followed by the falling of a \"great star from Heaven, burning as(if) it were a lamp\" 187 . This star was called Wormwood because it allegedlymade \"a third part of the waters\" of the world bitter and undrinkable 188 . Thisheralded a general blotting out of the Sun, Moon and stars, after which another\"star fell from Heaven unto Earth; and to him was given the key to thebottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out ofthe pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the Sun and the air were darkenedby reason of the smoke of the pit\" 189 .Finally there appeared \"a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns,and seven crowns upon his head. And his tail drew the third part of the stars ofHeaven, and did cast them to the Earth\" 1 '' 0 . This same red dragon was then\"cast down\" onto the Earth and a vast flood issued from its mouth 141 , and ituttered \"blasphemies\" (awful sounds) from the mouths of its seven heads whichcontin-ued to be emitted for \"forty and two months\" 192 .These extraordinary passages clearly state that, during a tremendous cosmicconflict, several of the participating bodies actually crashed to Earth.Although we are not told in which hemisphere these objects fell, they reportedlycame down well apart - one in a chasm, one in the sea, another which renderedwaters undrinkable, and one (a 'drag-on'-like body) which inferentially fell onland. Very likely most of these objects vaporised or totally disintegratedbefore making physical contact with the terrestrial surface (excepting thesupposed impact crater off the eastern coast of the United States), thisoccurring a short distance above ground level.At the time, 'collapsed sky' conditions had already been established over manyregions, the thick, particle-charged atmosphere contributing materially to theultimate combustion of most of the falling bodies.Widespread atmospheric derangements must also have occurred as prominentsubsidiary effects in the vicinity of each blast area. Respecting these, it issurely significant that several ancient texts aver that, when these 'stars' andthe 'dragon' fell to Earth, \"Heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolledtogether, and every mountain and island moved out of their place\" (our italics)193 , and that Heaven was \"cloven\" 194 or \"rent in twain\" 195 . The Norse epicssignificantly mention that the \"sons of Muspelheim\" (Phaeton's attendants)\"ride\" through this opening as they plummet earthwards 196 .The power and velocity of these blasts and shock waves must have been appalling,and the associated wind speeds phenomenal. No organism, large or small, withinscores of miles of the blast areas could have survived. Needless to add, suddenlocal withdrawals of air sucked into these areas by the final vaporisingexplosions would have been lethal for all air-breathing inhabitants of theaffected regions.Especially interesting at this juncture is the multi-headed 'dragon'. Notimprobably it represents the state of the last major remnants of Kingu which, atthe time, were cascading earthwards as burning masses of'See Note 18jagged material superficially resembling a 'horned dragon'. Presumably, theburning mountain, the 'star' named Wormwood and the 'star' associated with the'bottomless pit' were other large pieces of Kingu preceding the 'dragon'-likeportion to Earth.We should particularly note that Michael (really Phaeton) did not succumb inthis drama, and that in Greek legend it was Phaeton's chariot and steeds whichdisintegrated and fell to Earth, just as, in Ute Indian tradition, it was awayward sun god called Ta-vi and not the opposing solar hero Ta-wats (Phaeton)who was \"shivered into a thousand fragments which fell to Earth\".Thus it was not Phaeton, but its 'attendants' which plummeted to earth, and itwas Kingu which, venturing into the terrestrial Roche zone, disintegrated andplunged earthwards in mighty blazing fragments. The lurid spectacle of thisfalling debris doubtless rivalled Phaeton itself in brilliance, amid theextensive gloom of 'collapsed sky' conditions, evidently leading terrifiedeye-witnesses unable to view events in their entirety to assume that it wasactually Phaeton which was crashing.Biblical and other texts refer to these falling objects as 'angels'. The Epistleof Jude, for example, states:And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their habitation[Heaven], He [God] hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto thejudgement of the great day. 197 .A very similar statement occurs in the Epistle of Peter, which tells us:For... God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, anddelivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement. 198All religions and mythologies which speak of Hell or a Hell-like realminvariably regard it as the abode of Satan and demons and as a placecharacterised by fire - everlasting fire. In the apocryphal Book of Enoch Hellis described as a vast abyss at \"...the end ofEarth and Heaven; here is the prison of the stars which had transgressed God'swill... Here shall be confined the angels...\" 199 . The same source elsewheretells us: \"And God confined the angels... in the fiery valley in the west...[where were] melted mountains of metal...\", during a frightful naturalconvulsion when \"heaven fell upon Earth [collapsed sky] and the Earth wasswallowed up by an immense abyss [crustal dislocation]; and hills crowded onhills, and mountains on mountains [plate tectonics]\" 200 . These awful eventsoccurred when \"...the waters boiled... and the Ark floated upon the water\" 201 ,an assertion confirmed by Peter in his second Epistle when he stated that God\"spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person... bringing in theflood upon the world of the ungodly\" 202 .These are clear references to the contemporaneity of the Deluge (Noah's), acosmic conflict (the 'war in heaven') and the fall of celestial objects(rebellious 'angels' from Heaven). In several accounts, the latter were somehowconfused or connected with a race of antediluvial giants traditionallyassociated with the north or the west. Thus Merezh-kovsky, who equated thegiants with 'fallen angels' (Phaeton's attendants), concluded:In the Book of Enoch, the human giants of the pre-flood world, the 'Sons ofGod', the hen Elohim, the fallen angels, are men of the extreme west. 203 .Norse epics place their abode in the far north-west:Far in the north-west - to all nations in our hemisphere [northern] the abode ofdarkness - is Jotunheim, where the giants dwell... 204The direction from which the celestial objects came that were apparentlyresponsible for creating the oriented 'lakes', 'bays' and 'craters' was north ornorth-west relative to the present North Pole. Moreover, except for the Dutch'bays', all these features lie far west or north-west of Europe and Asia Minorwhere these traditions have been preserved.A definite northern source for this bombardment is seemingly implied in thosetraditions which mention the Bifrost Bridge. The Norse Eddas state that thisbridge, allegedly constructed by the gods during the wonderful primeval GoldenAge, existed near Meru in the formerly equable North Polar latitudes. When theMidgard Serpent and its associates assaulted Earth, the Bifrost Bridge wasreputedly set on fire, and it broke up under the onslaught of the 'sons ofMuspelheim\", who are said to have ridden through a 'cloven' heaven. A huge fierychasm opened beneath the bridge, into which it collapsed. This was presumablythe 'immense abyss' and 'fiery valley' which scriptural texts locate at the 'endof Earth and Heaven' (exactly where the Eddas place the Bifrost Bridge), andwhere the 'prison' of the 'stars which had transgressed' was situated.The opening up of a large fiery chasm at or near the North Pole seems scarcelycredible, until it is realised that the pole concerned was not the present onebut that of the pre-catastrophic world, which was located a considerabledistance from the site of its modern counterpart. Was the final resting place('prison' or 'fiery valley') of at least some of these celestial objects('fallen angels') therefore some site now north-west of the present North Pole -a site which, at the time, had split open as a gigantic crustal fractureexposing sub-adjacent molten magma, or which had collapsed en bloc throughcrustal dislocation and had begun to fill with erupting magma?The previously-mentioned references to 'everlasting chains under darkness' andthe widely-held concept of hell as the domain of raging fire may thus signifygravitational or electromagnetic capture (chaining) on the one hand, and theexposure, through lithospheric fracturing, to fire on the other. Subsequentcooling and solidifying of the magma below which the 'fallen angels' allegedlylay buried would thus explain the added phrase 'under darkness'.No exceptionally large crustal fractures that could now be termed an abyss orchasm have been traced in latitudes northwards of Spitzbergen, although thegreat world crackdiscussed in Part One runs as far North as that archipelago, and can be followedacross the floor of the Arctic Ocean to the Russian mainland immediatelysouth-west of the New Siberian Islands 205 . Much of the north polar region,however, generally exhibits evidence of massive and geologically recent crustalshortening, suggesting of a former folding-in upon itself of the lithospherethere. One such example concerns the Barents Sea and the anomalous depths of theEurasian Basin (Nansen Basin) and its margins which:...represent a regional collapse of the Earth's surface due to material beingremoved from the lower mantle. ZOh (Our italics).It would, of course, be premature to insist that this north polar crustalshortening in any way supports the admittedly unverifiable claims of ancientliterature, tradition and legend. We merely draw attention here to itsexistence, its location and its inferred cause, and to the fact that severalapparently similar crustal collapse areas lie along or near the line of thepreviously-mentioned oriented 'lakes'.A particularly large and geologically recent instance has been noted immediatelyeast of the Kamchatka peninsula. This location lies close to the suggestedtrajectory of the object or objects advocated as having caused the oriented'lakes' of Siberia and Alaska and over which, we submit, must have passed thegroup of objects which eventually came down over north-eastern Bolivia. If theflight-lines produced by aligning these groups of oriented 'lakes' and 'bays'are extended back towards a point of convergence, that point lies in thesouthern hemisphere. This detail becomes interesting when we recall that severalAsiatic accounts of these celestial assailants specifically state that theyinitially arrived from the south. Again, can apparent concordance between suchintrinsically dissimilar details be entirely coincidental?The preceding reconstruction of what appears to have occurred immediately afterthe disintegration of Kingu imparts new significance to the hitherto curiousbelief amongmany peoples that the 'devil' or 'dragon' once flung huge stones great distancesover the terrestrial landscape.Numerous independent traditions about the Phaeton disaster refer to rocks,stones and dust being cast down upon the Earth by the main celestial antagonistsat the time of that dire event. Sometimes these missiles are described as 'hail'and as falling 'mingled with fire' or accompanied by loud or frightening noises.Conventional icy hail does not fall with fire and, even in heavy falls, is notparticularly noisy. Obviously a different kind of 'hail' is meant. The followingexamples reveal that the 'hail' was largely stony.The pre-Columbian Toltecs assert that long ago \"there fell a rain of gravel\"accompanied by a \"rain of fire\", when \"all which existed burned\" 207 . APeruvian recollection tells of a vast stone which \"fell from Heaven to Earth andbroke into sixteen hundred pieces\" 208 . Algonquin legends refer to a tremendousprimeval battle between the celestial brothers Manibozho and Chakekenapok. Theformer prevailed and broke Chakekenapok into many pieces which he \"scatteredover the land\" when \"the face of nature was desolated by a tornado\", \"...thegigantic bowlders and loose rocks found on the prairies are the missiles hurledby the mighty combatants\" 209 .Early Mexican accounts of the same event mention that the sky \"rained not waterbut fire and red-hot stones\" 210 , and that the stones \"...levelled wholeforests\" 211 . In the Old World, an ancient tradition from the Atlas Mountainsnear Bou-Merzoug asserts that long ago \"...a wicked people lived there, and fortheir sins stones were rained upon them from heaven\" 212 . Buddhist texts onworld cycles say similar things: \"There arises a wind to destroy the worldcycle... it rains a fine dust... boulders as large ...as mighty trees on thehilltops... [it] turns the ground upside down... [when] worlds clash withworlds\" 213 . Even the early Chinese believed that planets closely approachingEarth (which, of course, they do not) occasion great showers of stones 214 .This near-universal belief that ages ago Earth and everything upon it wasbombard-ed by a multitude of cosmic missiles, both large and small, fiery and stony,cannot be without foundation, particularly when those same beliefs specificallycorrelate that event with a mighty celestial conflict and tremendous physicalchanges on Earth. We have seen that several terrestrial regions host theremarkable youthful ground structures of 'bays' and 'lakes' which, in the lightof all present evidence, are best explained as blast effects caused by largeconcentrations of aerially-detonating bodies. The fact that they lie in parallelrows and chains, often overlapping each other, strongly supports thatinterpretation. Furthermore, their general close proximity and theirlocalisation (in groups) in particular areas indicate the involvement ofveritable swarms of objects, with their detonations following one another inrapid succession.Rains of fire can only signify falls of burning gases or hydrocarbons, or both.Several authorities, including T A Link 21 ', argued that petroleum residuetraced in some meteorites possibly indicates that both meteorites and petroleumare remnants of a former, but now disintegrated planet-like body on whichpetroleum had been present, and that such a body existed between the presentMartian and Jovian orbits. This is precisely where Tiamat and Kingu apparentlyonce existed.The great majority of these missiles can only have been fragments of thedisintegrated Kingu, which, on exploding, must have hurled burning pieces ofitself literally in all directions. Those nearest Earth inevitably hurtledthrough the atmosphere towards the crust, igniting and fragmenting as they didso. Those thrown away from Earth may have completely escaped Earth'sgravitational field and gone great distances into interplanetary space beforesettling down into eccentric orbits. The origin of the meteor swarms and bandsof comparatively small, apparently stony, maverick objects occupyinginterplanetary space between the Sun and Jupiter, of which numerous sightingshave been made for centuries (see Appendix C) may also be explained by thisdisintegration.Iron bound« _i,«^;.ij.j_ .Many traditional accounts of this awful calamity mention sticky or inflammableblood-like fluids falling from the sky as 'hot naphtha', 'bitumen' or 'rains offire'. The possible hydrocarbon origins of some have already been touched upon,while we may also reasonably infer that the fluids described as blood-likeconsisted not of blood but of a red or brownish-red liquid. In one account fromFinland it is compared to a 'red milk' 216 . This description suggests that itwas thick and opaque. Like the sticky and inflammable substances, these red'rains' were inimical to terrestrial life.Traditions refer to these blood-like rains many times. Mt Haemus in Thrace, forexample, was anciently so named because of the \"stream of blood which gushed outon the mountain\" when a 'thunderbolt' (a massive electrical discharge) struckTyphon (Phaeton) during its flight over the Balkans 217 . The Orphic hymns ofclassical Greece refer to remotely early times when, as Earth \"groanedfearfully\" amid terrible convulsions, a discoloured sea was \"troubled with itspurple waves\" 218 .The Tatars of Central Asia remember a great world conflagration preceded by a'rain of blood' which turned the \"whole world red\" 219 , while in theafore-cited Babylonian epic the entire world is said to have been coloured redby the 'blood' of the vanquished Tiamat 220 . We also recall the 'hail mingledwith blood' mentioned in the version of this cataclysm given in the Book ofRevelation 221 . A similar statement in the Apocalypse of Thomas avers that \"agreat cloud of blood shall come down... a rain of blood upon all the Earth\" 222. Even the Maya of pre-Colombian Mexico remember a time of tremendous worldupheaval when the waters of all the rivers turned to a bloody redness as theSun's motion was disturbed 223 .These and various other similar traditions clearly state that this red liquidarrived and fell as a 'great cloud' or as a 'stream' and that it rained downglobally ('all the world'). Immense quantities of it must have existed even tohave fallen even as a light short-lived shower over an area as extensive as theEarth's surface. But what was its origin and its true nature? We may never beable to answer these questions for certain, although some educated guesses canbe attempted, which are seemingly consistent with the available details.Ancient Mesopotamian texts repeatedly allude to the original 'watery' nature ofTiamat - special names such as Tehom-Raba ('watery monster') being used tostress that characteristic 224 . Interestingly, Tehom-Raba means 'great Tiamat'in the Hebrew language. From such fragments we may conclude that Tiamat wasessentially a watery planet and that very large quantities of water wereprobably dispersed into space during Tiamat's destruction.Assuming that Tiamat possessed some sort of central core composed of dense,perhaps mainly metalliferous, material, this too might have been fragmented andpartially vaporised into dust-sized particles by Marduk's final destructive'arrow'. This 'arrow' (a gigantic bolt of intense electrical energy?), ancienttexts assert, \"tore her belly... cut through her insides, tore into her womb\"(penetrated to Tiamat's core). If valid as an interpretation, then thisdisintegration of Tiamat's core produced billions of particles which werescattered into space as a vast cloud close to where Tiamat had previouslyexisted. Indeed the ancient texts virtually record this very process:...(Marduk) severed the channels of her blood And caused the North Wind to bearitTo places that have been unknown.In other words, Tiamat's 'blood' was scattered to regions where it had neverpreviously been - that is, the area of space just indicated.In space, any metalliferous particles of Tiamat's former core would have rapidlyoxidised red or brown, while mixing and freezing solid with Tiamat's similarlydispersed fluids. Upon freezing, ice rinds must have enveloped the constituentparticles. These, with the frozen liquids (ice), probably developed a highlyreflective albedo.It is curious, therefore, that a 'sea of crystal' allegedly preceded the red'dragon' in space prior to the fall of, firstly, the 'burning mountain' whichturned the world's waters blood red, secondly the 'star' named Wormwood whichturned the world's waters bitter, and thirdly the 'dragon', itself red 225 .If remnants of Tiamat's original hydrosphere, atmosphere and core indeed mixedand froze together, this 'sea of crystal' presumably consisted of those remainsof Tiamat which, the ancient records allege, were 'captured' and taken in tow byMarduk (Phaeton) as it proceeded sunwards. Such frozen masses, possessing highlyreflective albedos, could easily have resembled a celestial 'sea of crystal'.And when the constituent materials eventually fell to Earth, as numerousaccounts insist that they did, what better description of them could be giventhan 'hail mingled with blood' 226 (ice mixed with liquid ferruginous matter andmetalliferous particles)?An alternative interpretation of these 'blood' rains could be, despite thetraditional insistence that they were a legacy of Tiamat, as easily attributedto the break-up of Kingu in Earth's Roche zone. The larger pieces of Tiamat'sformer satellite - the 'burning mountain', the 'star', Wormwood, etc -constituted portions of its core or crust, while the red 'milk', 'rains ofblood' etc represented liquefied and oxidised smaller fragments.The likeliest explanation, however, is that the rains with their red pigment hadindeed mostly originated with Tiamat, and that the larger objects were fallingremnants of the shatteredKingu. By the very nature of things, all arrived in the vicinity of Earth at thesame time, and either fell more or less simultaneously or in quick succession.Confused, panic-stricken observers understandably assumed that all this fallingmaterial shared a common origin.The bitter taste of the waters polluted by the 'star' Wormwood and the bloodcolour imparted to the sea by the 'burning mountain' were obviously chemicalreactions between essentially incompatible substances. It is probably reasonableto suppose that the bitterness and the bloody colour of these waters derivedfrom ferric matter, such as often tends to stain sediments and stones with deepred or brown tints. Remarkable concentrations of ferrous minerals and traces offerruginous staining exist in various terrestrial surface deposits evidentlylaid down at the time of the Phaeton disaster. A closer look at some of them ismost informative.Several geologically young deposits, both on land and under the sea, exhibitmarkedly red or red-brown tints. Similar tints characterise many cave earths andfissure fillings. Almost the entire floor of Kesslerloch cave in Switzerland,for example, in which numerous animal bones were embedded, was coloured red withiron oxide 227 . We have already noted some fissures in Carniola in-filled bynearly pure iron ore. So-called 'Pleistocene' bone breccias are also oftenstrongly ferruginised and silicified as, for example, that in Tea Tree Cave,Queensland 228 . Similar iron-stained bones have been found in many fissures,such as on the Isle of Portland, England.Bones of 'late Pleistocene' animals encountered in 'drift' deposits arefrequently iron-stained. Mammal remains from high-terrace gravels at Acton andTurnham Green, west London, for example, exhibited abundant traces of amanganous deposit and were described at the time of their discovery as being\"loaded with manganous oxide\" 229 . Blue-grey iron sands overlay the celebratedrhinoceros carcass found in Vilyui valley, Siberia, and even some of theso-called Miocene plants found in north-west Greenland occurred in a 'sparryiron ore' 230 .Iron or manganese staining of 'drift' deposits and associated organic remains,con-ventionally attributed to ice action or the environment this believedly created,are usually ascribed to periglacial conditions. Thus, black manganese stainingin gravels at Radley Oxfordshire, England, is accounted for by this process,which is said to have been of brief duration 231 . But if, as argued in PartOne, glacial conditions did not exist when these gravels were deposited - and,very significantly, molluscs in these same gravels indicate 'warm'('interglacial') conditions -other circumstances must have caused the staining.A rusty colour is also characteristic of much of the 'Pleistocene' loessformation. In northern China, for example, loess occurs extensively as areddish-hued surface deposit in which \"...iron-manganese Pisolites are oftendisseminated in its basal layer\" (our italics) 232 . Studies of these loessicloams reveal that their red colour \"...can neither be a quality inherited fromthe original matter of which the loams are composed, nor a condition broughtabout by slow chemical processes long after their formation\" 233 . In otherwords, the reddish tints were imparted to the loams during their deposition, andone may reasonably suppose that the above-mentioned iron-manganese Pisoliteswere also. Loessic loams in other parts of the world show similar metalliferousassociations. Thus, in Nebraska, where loam abounds, as much as 20.26% of itconsists of aluminium and 7.80% of iron 234 . Although numerous other examplescould be cited, it must suffice here to state that mineral grains composingloessic deposits consist \"...mostly of silica and associated heavy minerals(and) are fresh and angular...\" 235 (our italics).The fresh and angular appearance of these grains signifies geological modernity,while the very presence of heavy minerals in a surface deposit is mostinteresting. The occurrence of so much aluminium is likewise interesting in viewof the recently-monitored exceptional concentration of aluminium-26 in the outervicinity of the solar system, referred to in Part Four.Deltaic deposits at the mouth of the Fraser River, British Columbia, broughtdown from inland regions characterised by extensive 'drift' beds and allegedglacial sculpturing,represent another example of recent surface deposits charged with \"abnormalconcentrations\" of heavy metals, including cobalt, lead, zinc, copper, manganeseand iron 236 . That 'drift'-age deposits elsewhere consistently containsignificant quantities of these metals reveals how many modern surface deposits(deltaic and otherwise) have acquired their metalliferous contents. Naturalerosion, leaching and other processes transfer ores from older to youngerdeposits, often investing bones and other remains with a metalliferous (andsometimes ochreous) patina (covering). Thus, a small carved figurine retrievedlate last century from coarse sand over 280ft (86m) below ground level at Nampa,Idaho, was found to be covered with reddish iron oxide 237 , which must haveformed around it soon after its burial.It is clear, therefore, that appreciable quantities of metals which existlocally in the 'drift' were deposited coevally with it and the animal and plantremains it contains. Considerable amounts of gold, for example, have occurred in'drift' gravels in California, Alaska and Siberia, where mammoth and otheranimal remains abound, and as small isolated nuggets at various places in NorthCarolina, South Carolina and Virginia 238 , just to name a few localities.Significantly, these finds closely abut the main area of the Carolina 'bays'!If, as previously suggested, the formation of the Carolina 'bays', thedeposition of 'drift' and the annihilation of the mammoths and theircontemporaries was due to cosmic agencies epitomised by Phaeton and itsentourage, it is undoubtedly noteworthy that iron was anciently regarded as the'bones of Typhon' by the Egyptians, or as the 'droppings of the serpent'(Phaeton) by the early Jews. Indeed, Phaeton, irrespective of the name by whichit was remembered, was widely associated with a great variety of metals inantiquity. The Chinese believed gold to be the dragon's breath, and glass orcrystal its congealed breath 23 \". Phaeton's companions, Leviathan and Behemothwere both thought to have produced gold and precious stones 240 . Even the earlyPeruvians accorded a celestial origin to gold and silver, the former beingregarded as 'tears wept by the Sun' and the latter as 'tears of the Moon' 241 .These notions subsequently became corrupted into dragons guarding gold and othertreasures.But fanciful and distorted though these ancient memories may now be, theyunquestionably date back to the time when a severely heated Earth ran withstreams of moltenand magnetised metals, derived, perhaps, as much from its cosmic assailants asfrom existing terrestrial lodes and veins of ore. Later, after solidifying oncemore, men came to believe that all had been produced by terrible celestialmonsters. Magnetised iron, incidentally, was the first iron known to have beenworked by man.10 The Rains of Deaths^s^^s^fejisr*As long ago as 1872, the Challenger oceano-11 graphic expedition, which sailedover 68,000 nautical miles in circumnavigating the globe, recorded the presenceon the world's ocean floors of myriads of small, black, nickel-rich magneticspherules having diameters in the order of 10-50 microns (u). They appeared tobe especially abundant in the deepest basins. The existence of these tinyobjects was repeatedly confirmed in the late 1940s by the Swedish marineexploration vessel Albatross, the observations made then rekindling interest inthe spherules. Indeed, after considering all relevant factors, both E J Opik 242and Kurt Frederick-son 243 independently concluded that the spherules were veryprobably of meteoric origin.Also covering much of the floors of the deep ocean basins is a distinctivedeposit which, though usually tinted a rusty brown, is known as the red clay. Itoccupies \"...about 102 million km 2 \" and represents a prodigious tonnage since\"...at an average depth of about 200 metres, there would be some 10 16 tons ofred clay on the ocean floors\" 244 . Naturally radioactive, this clay derives itscolour from ferric hydroxide and a small amount of manganese oxide 243 , andconsists of very fine-grained sediments mixed with coarse silt and sandfractions originating in theoceans, as well as hydrogenous minerals, volcanogenic debris and ferromanganeseconcretions 24 *.Sea-bed clays and muds from the Arctic are coloured brown due to the presence inthem of enormous quantities of oxidised ferric iron particles, while those fromthe sea-floor near the New Siberian Islands, in the White Sea and the BarentsSea contain a notably high percentage of manganese oxide 247 . Examining claysamples from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, Pettersson discovered that theycontained layers of volcanic ash and large amounts of nickel and radium - twoelements almost completely absent from sea water. He observed that \"nickel is avery rare element in most terrestrial rocks and continental sediments and isalmost absent from ocean waters\" 248 . Pettersson attributed the origin of theiron and nickel in these clays to \"...very heavy showers of meteorites in theremote past\" 249 . He also added:Assuming the average nickel content of meteoric dust to be two per cent, anapproximate value for the rate of accretion of cosmic dust to the whole Earthcan be worked out from these data. The result is very high - about 10,000 tonsper day, or over a thousand times higher than thevalue computed from counting the shooting stars (meteors) and estimating theirmass. 250In many areas, however, the red clays possessing this unexpectedly high nickelcontent rest directly upon geologically very recent lavas and basalts,indicating that they (and their nickel content) must be younger still. At someplaces these clays form only thin veneers or are altogether absent. Thus,considering all these details in unison, not only must the supposed meteorshower have been recent rather than ancient, but its occurrence must have beensudden, its volume enormous and - in view of the wide distribution of the clay -its operation global.This last factor is contrary to the normal behaviour of the average meteorshower, even of an exceptionally large one. Meteor showers inevitably enter theterrestrial atmosphere from one quadrant only at any given time. However, owingto the rotation of the Earth, most, if not all, parts of the world's surfacecould theoretically receive meteoric material over a twenty-four hour period. Toaccount for the enormously high tonnage here, we must imagine either a veritablemeteor blizzard continuously pounding the Earth for weeks on end, or the Earthpassing through (or being passed by) a vast cloud of metalliferous debris whichenveloped more or less every part of the planet's surface almost simultaneously.On remembering that, at this phase of the disaster, Earth had either been brakedto a halt, or its rotation was markedly slowed, such near-instantaneous globalfalls of huge quantities of ferruginous dust becomes easier to understand.New significance thus attaches to the Finnish tradition that, when the Sun andMoon once disappeared and 'red milk' was sprinkled over the world, 'hailstonesof iron' fell prodigiously - likewise to those recollections of fine dustfalling endlessly from the skies while the Deluge waters swept across the Earth.In turn, these indicate that we are not dealing here with a meteor shower butwith a gigantic cloud of cosmic debris, the origin of which we have alreadysuggested.Finally, we must consider more fully the ferromanganese concretions found in thered clay. Usually referred to as manganese nodules, these irregularly-shapedobjects range in size from that of a garden pea to lumps up to 3ft (0.9m) inlong diameter, and exist in countless numbers on the sea-bed worldwide 251 .Like the associated red clays, the nodules are naturally radioactive 252 , andat some localities are astonishingly abundant, forming veritable 'fields' and'pavements'. Some 'fields' consist of nodules packed so densely that theytotally cover almost 100% of the sea-floor 253 . The wider distribution of thenodules is patchy, however. We are told, for example, that in the easterncentral Pacific Ocean:...records were taken with bottom-near television cameras, for hundreds ofkilometres. For 5% of the records the sea-floor was covered to more than 50% bynodules, that is up to 25kg of ore per square metre. Conversely, 5% of therecords showed the sea-floor free of nodules. Elsewhere, the cover varied,sometimes considerably, even over distances of only 50m. The reasons for thepatchiness are not clear... 254The areas richest in nodules occur in the north-equatorial Pacific region 255 .Globally, however, it has been estimated that the nodules represent between 100and 200 billion tonnes of material 256 . Map 5F shows the main areas from whichthey have been reported 257 , the concentrations in the Pacific and the westernAtlantic, east of the Carolina 'bays, being immediately noticeable.Manganese nodules are rich in cobalt, nickel, copper and other heavy elements258 , a factor suggesting to several authorities the idea that the nodules,which are thought to grow through natural chemical accretion of these and otherelements in sea water, are very old. A very slow growth - one estimate suggests\"a few millimetres per million years, at most\" 259 - has been postulated becausethese metal are rare in sea water, and long ages must have passed for the nod-picture81 [images/picture81.jpg]rvt yyn =3 ©g ?§Oi ns •;« ° 5c c ~ 8 3.1 2i \"S t:G°-3•C gO J\" Ea; X) ^S fa\"*O 3 K— 2 OSc c ■_.QJ CI UQj >-1)3 «i8 \"I*fa 01 fc£ ■£ gx: oj ~ u -= a.llio .PC Oules to have attained their present size by such processes. The fact that theoverwhelming majority of these nodules occur on the surface or uppermost layersof the red clay has suggested to some that they have formed principally in areasof low sedimentation rates, since \"...because of their slow growth they wouldsoon be covered up in regions of high sediment supply\" 260 .No plausible explanation has yet been advanced to account for the formation ofnodules in such areas. We have already seen, however, that the twin notions of agreat age and slow deposition rate for the red clays are apparently erroneous -especially where the clays overlie geologically young lavas and basalts - andthe inference must be that the associated nodules are at least as youthful ifnot more so. In any case, major geophysical changes to ocean floorsapproximately 11,500 years ago (see Part One) clearly nullify the concept ofsea-bed deposits slowly accumulating under generally stable conditions over verylong periods of time, or of a similar slow growth for the nodules. The abundanceand distribution of the nodules is remarkable, yet if the sea water below whichthey lie is almost devoid of the materials from which they allegedly form, andif the associated sea-floors and bottom sediments are indeed geologicallyyouthful 261 , then the nodules must have formed under other circumstances.When all these factors are taken into consideration, they suggest that thenodules have been dumped en masse rather than accumulating slowly. This impliesa cosmic source which, if correct, signifies that they arrived suddenly and invast numbers. We recall that several traditional memories of that frightfulevent agree that some celestial object disintegrated into innumerable fragmentswhile in the vicinity of Earth, shower-ing it with its remnants. Are these nodules further evidence of that calamityand (considering their heavy mineral content) of shattered core material fromTiamat, or Kingu, or both?Earth's apparently 'recent' acquisition of iron-impregnated matter (subsequentlyaccumulated as loess and red clay) and of enormous quantities of metalliferousnodules certainly calls for exceptional circumstances. Among other effects,these acquisitions would have rendered water supplies bitter and unpalatable.World tradition remembers just such a 'recent' event - the Phaeton disaster.As noted previously, world tradition also links the bitterness of Earth's waterswith a widespread loss of marine life. Can it be coincidence, therefore, thattogether with other life-forms, pteropods suffered mass mortality in the easternAtlantic during the alleged Weichselian (Wurmian) phase of the so-called IceAge? Today, the remains of these marine organisms are embedded in sea-floorsediments stretching from Portugal to Senegal, a distance of 1,560 miles(2,500km). These sediments, which have apparently been washed by red tidesseveral times, are estimated to have been deposited sometime between 14,000 and11,000 years BP 262 - exactly that division of time when the Phaeton disasterapparently occurred. This pteropod destruction has been attributed directly to asudden increase in sedimentation resulting from \"rapid hydrographic and climaticchanges\" 261 , both highly prominent features of the Phaeton event!It would seem, therefore, that both ferruginous dust and metalliferous noduleswere simply further aspects of the tremendous celestial bombardment responsiblefor the aforementioned oriented 'bays' and 'lakes'. In short, they were indeed'rains of death'.The Water Mountain«^»»$**.ji4>sr-»Unquestionably the most widely remembered expression of the Phaeton disaster wasthe Deluge. It allegedly drowned all living things and is stated to haveextinguished a terrible world fire. The Deluge was thus rather a latedevelopment during this dreadful catastrophe. Moreover, the numerous traditionalaccounts referred to in Part Three clearly reveal that the Deluge was an almostinevitable outcome of the tremendous events immediately preceding it.These same accounts also describe several highly unusual aspects of the Delugewhich are at variance with the popular (and oversimplified) concepts of how theDeluge supposedly behaved. Broadly speaking, the Deluge is an umbrella headingembracing three distinct phases: first, a temporary but singular heaping-up ofterrestrial water in a specific region, secondly, an equally remarkable torrentof cosmic origin, and thirdly, the release across the greater part of the worldof the united terrestrial and cosmic waters as an irresistible flood.A recurrent theme in the Deluge traditions generally concerns the extraordinaryheights attained by these flood waters. In Genesis we find that:...the waters prevailed exceedingly on the Earth, and all the high hills thatwere under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the watersprevail, and the mountains were covered. 264A cubit is generally regarded as having corresponded to 17.58 inches (44.6cm),so 15 cubits would signify that the flood waters rose about 23ft (7m). If abovetoday's highest mountains, then to more than five miles(8km)! We have seen, however, that antediluvian peaks were probably much lowerthan those of present times, so the seemingly exaggerated height reportedlyreached by the flood-waters may not be so extravagant after all. Notwithstandingsuch possibilities, we are still told that \"...the waters stood above themountains\" (our italics), as tremendous winds caused them to \"...mount up to theheavens\" 265 , and \"He [God] gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap\"266 .Maori traditions also speak of terrific winds lashing the Deluge waters intomountain-high billows 267 , just as ancient Chinese records mention that thewaters, \"...in their vast extent over-topped the great heights, threatening theheavens with their floods\" 268 . An independent Midrashic account goes so far asto assert that: \"The waters were piled up to a height of sixteen hundred miles,and they could be seen by all the nations of the Earth\" 269 - anear-unbelievable claim. There are essentially similar, if less exorbitant,accounts of this watery distortion, such as the following Lappish traditiondescribing the destruction of a wicked antediluvian world by the angry deityJubmel, who allegedly promised: \"I shall reverse the world. I shall bid therivers flow upward; I shall cause the sea to gather together itself up into ahuge towering wall which I shall hurl upon your wicked Earth-children, and thusdestroy them and all life\" 270 .Other accounts tell of waters piled up to heights so great that they'overtopped' mountains and appeared to threaten the 'heavens' themselves; watersgathered into a 'huge towering wall' and so on. The prevailing picture iseverywhere consistent and quite unlike that usually conveyed by artists and somescholars of slowly-rising flood301waters. The dominating vision, then, is of a colossal heap or wall of watergathered together at a particular locality (or hemisphere) and held there bysome immense gravitational force. A hint is given of this effect in Psalms,where we read that this watery heap \"...stood fast\" 271 . In other words, it wasimmobile. Such a phenomenon is explicable only if a second gravitational fieldwas acting in opposition to terrestrial gravity, a field which caused 'rivers toflow upward', which 'heaped up' the ocean waters and which then held themstationary, for a definite interval. The opposing gravitational field waspresumably Phaeton's.*This point assumes particular significance when we discover the BabylonianTalmud asserting that: \"Seven days before the Deluge, the Holy One changed theprimeval order...\" 272 , an observation anciently remembered by numerous nationsand implying a change in the Earth's previous axial stability and rotationalspeed, with water flowing uphill rather than downhill.Especially significant is the conclusion reached as far back as 1936 by Hess andMacClintock, who, in considering the effects of a hypothetical astral influencewhich suddenly decreased Earth's rotational speed and caused a rapid change inthe shape of the hydrosphere, inferred that sea levels would be greatlydepressed in low (equatorial) latitudes and drastically raised in high (polar)latitudes 271 . This is precisely what the aforementioned traditions appear toimply. The heaping up of Earth's waters evidently occurred at or around theoriginal poles, or, just possibly, principally at one pole only -the northernone.At this juncture we should recall those traditions which refer to the Delugewaters as having flowed strongly northwards. It may be surmised that these werewaters being gravitationally attracted to the polar latitudes. The incredibleabnormal weight of accumulated water at one pole may have been as much the causeof an axial tilt as the near-proximity of a powerful external influence likePhaeton. Most probably, both factors working in concert effected that majorterrestrial change. One agrees, therefore, with Patten when, as one of the fewwriters who has perceived the true nature of the Deluge, he remarked:If one concludes that this great event in Earth history, the Flood, was indeed acosmic catastrophe, rather than merely a prolonged meteorological event, thenone must conclude that its cause was gravitational rather than heat, which isthe ultimate cause in floods caused by excessive rainfall [heat causing theevaporation and the organising of wind systems]. If the Flood was cosmic, it isnot only a gravitational catastrophe - it is a gravitational-magneticcatastrophe... 274Inevitably, the inhabitants of high latitudes experienced the most massiverising of the Deluge waters as they became piled up into a gargantuan 'watermountain' submerging all land. Salvation in 'arks' and other floating refugeswas the sole means of escape for those communities, while those in lowlatitudes, from which much water had been withdrawn polewards, this was not thecase.The Torrent from Heavenf^3jj&z-i±2jzr*A variety of traditional sources also refer to L what was seemingly yet anotheraspect of the Deluge, namely that very considerable quantities of water fromcelestial sources contributed to its final mass.In the Apocalypse of Thomas, for example, we read of blocks of 'hail' (ice)individually weighing about a hundredweight (50kg) showering Earth immediatelybefore the Deluge. Again the Zend-Avesta mentions that, when Tistrya assaultedEarth, it sent tremendous rain in which the drops were the size of saucers, orof a man's head, and were sometimes boiling hot. Raindrops of phenomenal sizeare said to have fallen when the thunder-god of the Sac and Fox Indians of NorthAmerica destroyed the primeval world long ago: they were allegedly the size ofwigwams 275 .In these and many similar recollection which could be cited, we seem to bedealing with falls of what may be aptly termed 'whole water - water whichdescended in drops so large that their origin and formation cannot have been dueto even the most chronic dust-polluted atmosphere. Obviously originatingelsewhere, their great size suggests that these huge 'raindrops' were almostcertainly great lumps of melted ice - pieces of the 'sea of crystal'(interpreted as an ice-field) which preceded Phaeton through space. Thus thelargest pieces, melting slowest, appeared as huge 'drops' of 'whole water' whenthey reached the ground, and they naturally excited lasting astonishment. Thattheir exceptional size was noticed amid the chronically deranged conditionssuggests that these 'raindrops' fell, not so much in the high latitudes wherethe 'water-mountain' would obscure the falls, but in the low latitudes largelybereft of water, and where numerous confused individuals still dwelt.The truly staggering duration of this rain deserves further comment. Best known,of course, is the 40 days mentioned in Genesis 276 , a duration also given bythe Tepanecas of pre-Columbian Mexico. The aforementioned tradition of the Sacand Fox tribes describes the rain as unlike any that has ever fallen before orsince. It was unparalleled. It was compared to \"seven water torrents\" 277 ,described as \"an overflowing rain, and great hailstones\" 278 , and reported ashaving \"...descended out of the clouds [collapsed sky] as if poured out ofjars... prodigiously, in drops like bull's heads, and men's heads, in handfulsand armfuls, both great and small\" 279 .Therefore this rain fell torrentially and uninterruptedly as a kind of celestialcascade or waterfall. It rapidly swamped everything upon which it fell. Clearlyit was no ordinary rain, a factor appreciated by many early writers whodifferentiated normal (seasonal or occasional) rains, which the called 'smallrains', from exceptional (cataclysmic) rains, which they called 'great rains'280 . Interestingly, these old accounts never mention 'great rains' except inassociation with catastrophic events, and then almost always as 'divine'retribution.In the Norse Eddas, during Odin's battle with the Fenris-Wolf, the upper heavenis alleged to have been shattered, its wreckage plummeting to Earth as hail andhuge blocks of ice. This shattering of the firmament or celestial vaultreappears in numerous ancient traditions. The Maori, for instance, recall howtheir hero Tawhaki, in a fit of rage, once stamped on the 'floor of heaven'. Theresultant crack permitted the celestial waters to pour down and flood Earth. InChinese tradition, a marauding dragon is substituted fro Tawhaki; while in theBundahish, 'demons' which \"dashed303against the celestial sphere\" are given as the culprits 281 . Everywhere,therefore, these extraordinary rains are consistently accorded a cosmic originand are associated with a tremendous celestial commotion - the Phaeton disaster.Among the Jewish myths collected by Josippa ben-Gorion are some whichspecifically refer to an amalgamation of positively differentiated terrestrial(female) and celestial (male) waters. One even provides details of the date whenthis allegedly occurred: \"On the seventeenth day of the month of Cheshvanthe male waters fell from the heavens while the female waters welled forth fromthe depths. They united and waxed strong and overwhelmed the Earth and all thatwas upon it\" 282 . Cheshvan was the second month of the old Jewish year. Avariant account mentions that the event happened in the month of Ijar, which isthe eighth month in the ordinary Jewish calendar. We shall later find thesedetails to be most significant, merely adding here that the version in Genesisalso states that the event occurred on the seventeenth day of the second month283 .*13Deluge«^s%fe>-j***=sr^The disintegration of Kingu signalled a marked lessening, or even breakdown, ofthe opposing gravitational fields which apparently held the 'heaped up'terrestrial waters immobile in high latitudes. This diminution evidentlyoccurred quite slowly at first, for several Amerindian legends, of which two aregiven below, relate how the advance of the released waters was watched forhours, even days, beforehand. It presumably reflected the steadily lesseninginfluence of the opposing gravitational field proportional to the rate ofdispersal of Kingu's debris and Phaeton's departure towards the Sun.The Choctaw of Oklahoma recall that after the primeval Earth had been plungedinto darkness \"for a long time\" (another reference to 'collapsed sky'conditions) a bright light appeared in the north, which occasioned great joy.The light, however, proved to be a wall of water composed of mountain-highwaters advancing toward the observers.A similar narrative preserved amongst the Navajo of Arizona describes how onemorning long ago there appeared in the east, andsubsequently in the south, north and west, a phenomenon which from a distanceresembled a high, steep wall of rock. It was, however, water steadily advancingtoward them. A variant Navajo legend contains further interesting details. Longago, the Navajo ancestors were surprised one day to see animals of every typerunning from east to west. Four days later they saw a bright light in the east,and those sent to investigate it returned with the news that it was a vast floodof water proceeding in their direction. Next morning this flood had drawn quiteclose, and filling the entire horizon except the west, advanced like a chain ofhigh mountains 284 .The significant point here is the consistent description of the flood waters asbeing prodigiously high and advancing as a watery wall. Once the 'heaped-up'terrestrial waters were released from the counter-gravitational grip holdingthem, they began to flow equa-torwards, slowly at first, but ever more speedilyas a stupendous watery avalanche of awesome power. Even the Koran 285 statesthat the Deluge bearing Noah's ark was simply a vast wave - and this rapidlyunited♦ See Note 20.with the very considerable quantity of water which had been received in lowerlatitudes from cosmic sources. Upon uniting, these waters formed the Delugeproper.A closer look at some of the effects of various major floods and marine stormsof modern times provides glimpses of the probable capacity power and behaviourof the Deluge. Moreover, measurements of water velocities amply demonstrate theterrifying force of large bodies in violent motion. Engineers concerned withcoastal sea-defences have long known of the power of stormy seas, when man-madestructures become puny things. Consider the following examples.Tremendous gales in December 1872 destroyed the seaward end of a largebreakwater at Wick, in northern Scotland. It was built of large concrete blockssecurely bound together and to the underlying bedrock by huge iron rods, andweighed over 800 tonnes.During the height of this winter gale the resident engineer watched theonslaught of the waves... Before his incredulous eyes, the whole mass of thepier was 'slewed around' until it was finally broken away from its attachments,lifted and deposited inside the pier. After the storm... divers... found thatnot only the concrete monolith but the whole of the lower mass attached to it byiron bolts had been carried away. The waves had torn loose, lifted and bodilymoved a mass weighing not less than 1,350 tons. Five years later... the newpier, weighing about 2,600 tons, was then carried away 286Previously-mentioned tsunamis can reach formidable heights. One in July 1958 atLituya Bay, southern Alaska, reached the immense height of 1,700ft (523m), andin scale and effect probably approached the equivalent characteristics of theDeluge water-avalanche. A subsequent report stated:Examining the sides of the bay, geologist Don Miller (and) seismologist DonTocher... found that the wave had swept along the side of the bay at about the100ft level, knocking down virtually all of the trees and stripping them oftheir bark. Thegreatest surprise was what happened on a mountain spur across a narrow inletfrom the largest of the rock falls. Here a swash swept up onto the ridge to aheight of 1,700ft, making a clean sweep of the forest so that only one tree wasleft standing amidst the ruins. The trees at the upper end were washed into theliving forest, showing that it was a wave rather than a landslide that causedthis damage. Miller, flying along the bay a few hours after the quake, saw greatmasses of water still running down the sides of the mountain. 287It is important to note that even the largest tsunamis that do occasionallyinvade the land are incapable of travelling very far inland and sustaining theirdestructive power. The Deluge waters clearly behaved otherwise. They consistedof colossal aqueous masses which arrived suddenly at particular localities,which exerted continuous pressures upon everything they overflowed, and which,even though of comparatively brief duration, also poured unabated over the landfor hours and days without respite. Only something like a displaced oceanrelocating itself could produce such effects. Thus, missing these crucial facts,every previous attempt to explain away the Deluge calamity simply as anunusually severe river flood or as a series of exceptional tsunamis has failedto convince.Discoveries made about water pressures and rates of flow today indicate how theDeluge waters must have acted in many regions all those millennia ago. It hasbeen determined that winter gales, such as regularly batter the Scottish coast,produce water pressures as great as 6,0001bs per square foot (25,834kg/m 2 ) 288. Pressures, however, largely depend on the depths of water concerned, and thespeed at which it happens to move or the wind drives it. Hurricanes, forexample, can drive waves ashore at speeds of 30-45mph (50-70kph), while thevelocity of the falling crest of a wave only 30ft (9m) high produces a pressureof 49 tonnes per square yard 289 . The pressures exerted by the Deluge watersmust have been immeasurably greater.Studies of the rate of flow of ocean waters of differentdepths have produced thefollowing results:Experiments have established that the force exerted on a surface increases asthe square of the velocity, and varies as the sixth power of the velocity of thecurrent involved. For instance, a current able to move a cube of given weightwould, if its velocity were doubled, be capable of moving a cube 64 timesheavier than the first-mentioned cube, and, if trebled, it could move a cube 729times as heavy, and so on. Relating such velocities to the transportation of'erratic' boulders by water, one investigator concluded that: \"There is no doubtthat blocks of 5 tons or upwards might be moved by a current of lOmph\" 290 .Moreover, while currents flowing at a mere 2-3mph (3-5kph) cannot move even amodest-sized pebble, those with a velocity of about lOmph (16kph) can moveblocks weighing several tonnes, currents moving at 15mph (24kph) can move 56tonnes or so in weight, at 20mph (32kph) they can move blocks around 320 tonnes,and others flowing at 50mph (80kph) or higher could move boulders weighing manythousands of tonnes 291 .There is no reason why many of the 'erratic' boulders could not have beentransported to their present locations by the Deluge waters, now that weperceive these as having been oceans undergoing relocation. Putnam 362 shows aboulder field assembled entirely by flash-flood waters in California. In allessentials it resembles others known to have been accumulated by mud-torrents,and yet others conventionally accorded glacial origins.But could water have actually uplifted 'erratics' sometimes weighing manythousands of tonnes from low to high levels - as noted in Part One? Some nearSettle in North Yorkshire, England, for instance, are 200ft(61m) higher than the nearest parent rocks 292 , while others elsewheresometimes lie higher still. In view of the above statistics, and of thestupendous pressures that ocean-sized masses of water on the move could exert,there appears no good reason why the Deluge waters could not have uplifted eventhe largest 'erratics'. In Part One we saw that ice could not have moved them.During the summer of 1810, Long Lake and Mud Lake in Vermont werecatastrophi-cally emptied of their waters. Eye-witness descriptions of whatoccurred furnish valuable clues as to the kind of things that must have happenedin many regions on a still greater scale at the time of the Deluge, andinterested readers would do well to consult the fascinating report by SEdwards-Dwight 293 . Among the effects produced in a matter of minutes was theexcavating of a huge gully 1 mile (0.4km) wide, and 50-90ft (15-28m) deep.Enormous immovable rocks jutting out of the valley sides altered the course ofthe torrent without lessening its force. Sand heaps up to 20ft (6m) deep andextending as much as an acre accumulated on the sides of these obstacles, andtorn-up trees were embedded in them. Marks of the torrent's violence were laterseen all the way down the valley to Lake Memphremagog, 21 miles (34m) distant.At Eno's Mill, 17 miles downstream, a boulder estimated to weigh 100 tonnes hadbeen moved many yards from its original location upstream.A horse caught by the torrent near Keene Corner was found a great distance downthe valley \"literally torn to pieces\". Eye-witnesses reported that the torrentbore before it all the trees in its path, so that it looked as though a forestwas on the move. Some of these were buried in sand and rubbish far down thevalley, while others covered a 20-acre field being piled up to a height of 25ft(7m). All eye-witnesses agreed that the noise was louder than the \"loudestthunder\".Similar devastation by pent-up waters occurred in 1818 in Switzerland, whenavalanches of impacted snow dammed a narrow pass containing the River Drance. Alarge lake was formed some 700ft (215m) wide and 200ft (61m) deep. Engineers hadsucceeded in draining off about half of the lake's water when the centralsection of the dam suddenly collapsed....the residue of the lake was emptied in half an hour. In the course of itsdescent the water encountered several narrow gorges, and at each of these theyrose to a great height... sweeping along rocks, forests, houses, bridges... Somefragments of granitic rocks of enormous magnitude... were torn out of a moreancient alluvium and borne down for a quarter of a mile. One fragment moved wassixty paces in circumference. The velocity of the water... was thirty-five feetper second. 294Severe floods in Scotland during 1829 actually cut new ravines in localhillsides and transported huge sandstone boulders some 200 yards (185m) - onebeing dumped 6ft (1.8m) above the level of its original site 295 . The hugemuddy floods resulting from the eruption of Mt St Helens in May 1980 causedsimilar effects:An avalanche of volcanic debris ploughed into Spirit Lake, forcing millions ofgallons of water through the lake's outlet. The velocity of the lahar [surge]was estimated at 29-55kph... Seven of the eight existing bridges were destroyed.The muddy flow poured through two logging camps 20km downstream, flipping overheavy equipment... devouring a locomotive... Thick mud, logs, boulders andanything else in the path of the lahar were swept up, carried to 70km downstreamand dumped into the Cowlitz River... About 39 million cubic metres of materialreduced the 180m wide shipping channel of the Columbia River from its normaldepth of 12m to a depth of 4,3m for a distance of 6km. 296At some places walls of mud and volcanic debris 195ft (60m) high were leftbehind, modern equivalents of the comparable 'Pleistocene' deposits discussed inPart One. All these examples repeatedly emphasise the erosional and excavatorypowers of violently agitated waters and the sheer volume of torn-up and relocated debris they are capable of moving. In every case vast waterpressures were involved.The pressure behind the initial watery face of the Deluge must have beentitanic. Until the final phase of their dispersion, when they had reached lowerlatitudes, these waters were irresistible. Such torrents easily demolishedcolossal pieces of the Earth's lithos-phere and transported them greatdistances, irrespective of local geography. It plastered up 'drift' againsthillsides facing north or north-west (surfaces opposing its direction of flow)and, as seen in Part One, rammed 'erratic' boulders into solid strata. Animaldebris in numerous bone-caves and rock fissures were frequently forcedunnaturally by the flooding into even the tiniest crevices and most tortuouspassages, sometimes penetrating the Earth's crust to great depths at all kindsof angles. Only under immense water pressures could such effects have beenproduced - ice pressure could not accomplish them.It is reasonable to infer that the external gravitational field responsible for'heaping up' the Deluge waters in high latitudes acted similarly on Earth'sinternal magma tides. If so, this must almost certainly have caused crustalbulging (the lithospheric expansion suggested by Oppenheim) in the northernhemisphere, together with a northwards flow of the magma normally south of theequator. Geoidal deformation almost certainly resulted, such as Taira 297 andothers have urged.For almost one hundred years, numerous geologists and physicists haveinvestigated this deformation as having been actual rather than theoretical. In1889, Rudzki recognised major geoidal deformation as having occurred during the'Ice Age' 298 , while in 1939, Sauramo placed the event in late Quaternary times299 , the very period we are considering.It has been widely recognised that this deformation was caused by the shiftingof surface loads 300 and pressures 301 , and with how far the flexibility of thelithosphere 302 contrived to cope with the creep-strength of Earth's mantle 303, and with the distribution of viscous matter deep within the Earth's interi-or 304 . The 'heaping up' of a large part of the terrestrial waters at onegeographical point was a remarkable instance of the shifting of surface loadsand pressures.The rapidity of this 'heaping up' meant that the shifting of the loads andpressures, and the subsequent deformation, was equally rapid. The magnitude ofthe crustal dislocationscaused by this deformation are thus more readily understood. However, with thedissipation of the external gravitational influences, both the magma tide andthe 'water mountain' were released. This led to the magma establishing a newequatorial 'bulge' and the consequential readjustments of the crust to meet thisnew geoidal shape.14Scours-^sa&Hi&sr*Bearing the above in mind, it is easy to understand how, in Cambridgeshire,England, ocean-sized masses of water wrenched out huge lumps of Cretaceousstrata, 430yds (397m) long and 60yds (55m) wide, and redeposited themincongruously many miles distant upon Jurassic strata 305 ; or how the weightand pressure of such watery masses so compressed and crushed rocks immediatelyunderlying 'boulder clay' around Holderness, Humberside, that they now look asthough a steam-roller had once passed over them 306 .*The piling up of the Deluge waters to great heights in narrow spaces onencountering mountainous obstacles, as in the Alps for example, explains thedeposition of huge rocks and great accumulations of gravel high on the flanks ofinfant peaks. These same waters banked up equally large accumulations of 'drift'against the lower slopes of the Himalayas, Andes, Altai mountains and otherprominent ranges. Although this deposition was assumed to be the result of iceaction, it is entirely consistent with water action on a stupendous scale, andsupports the view of several authorities who argued for a marine origin for alarge proportion of the 'drift'.The passage of the Deluge waters across the landscape - from a north-south ornorth-west-southeast direction as the evidence previously presented consistently shows- was obviously a transient affair, but it was not entirely uniform. Traditionsmention areas which escaped its ravages, and science has recognised suchisolated refuges as well -albeit refuges from glaciation 307 .Numerous collapsed portions of the Earth's crust soon became basins for the new(present) seas and oceans, and the Deluge waters must have streamed off thenewly-elevated land areas (the present continents) into these depressions.The Deluge was also a powerful scouring agent. Thus, vertical polished rockfaces on the northern side of Red Rock Pass, Alberta, were caused by water-bornepebbles carried tumultuously against them by exceptional water currents comingfrom the north. That the \"...polished surfaces show southward flow into theBonneville Depression\" 308 merely lends credence to the ancient Chinese claimthat the Deluge waters generally streamed south-east to drown great areas ofland which had subsided in that hemisphere because \"The whole Earth had tiltedand sunk\" 309 .Thus the scouring, scoring and polishing of rocks was, in many cases, caused byhigh-velocity water-borne debris of great depth and long continuous pressure,rather than by the conventionally-accepted glacial action.The scouring effects of water upon land surface strata is often seriouslyunderestimated. Many modern examples exist of cloudbursts achieving direeffects, such as the previously-mentioned 'moraine' found in Alabama lastcentury and the boulder debris which swamped Lynmouth, England in 1952. DrArkell described a similar event which occurred near Weymouth, Dorset, in 1955,when 11-12 inches (30cm) of rain fell on the adjacent hills in only 9 hours 3 \"1 . The cascading waters deepened, widened and cut new stream beds, scoured awayentire hillsides and gouged out a crevasse almost 6ft (1.8m) deep in the solidchalk. Boulders, rubble, heaps of soil and uprooted vegetation were strewneverywhere.If comparatively modest cloudbursts can produce such scour effects, theprodigious rains and the enormous aqueous movements associated with the Phaetondisaster musthave denuded the landscape infinitely more acutely. Soil and softer surfacedeposits would have been removed from whole regions, to bury hillsides andentire valleys elsewhere.Arkell regarded such downpours as:...comparatively rare events that really mould the landscape... Lyell'sprinciple of uniformitarianism... becomes credible only when it is realised thatthe 'exceptional' cloudburst is really part of the normal weather pattern, and,from the point of view of denudation, the important part.In this context we suggest that the Phaeton disaster was also a 'rare' and'exceptional' event, differing only from modern examples in its sheer scale andintensity Accordingly, the violence of its action was correspondingly greater.15 The 'Wood Hills' of the NorthS^jJaSH^ H ii J -^r*Enormous accumulations of sub-fossil and carbonised wood occur along the Arcticshores of Siberia, along the coastlines of the Bering Strait, and on variousislands both north and south of that channel. Staggering amounts exist on manyof the New Siberian Islands and, as we have seen, in the Alaskan 'muck' beds.The vast quantities of vegetable matter represent whole forests which have beenobliterated and buried catastrophically. The constituent trees, which includesycamore, poplar, alder and sequoia, today flourish much further south, andrepresent a typical Miocene/Pliocene forest assemblage, evidently forming partof that flora which persisted more or less unchanged into 'Pleistocene' times,before being overwhelmed.Before its submergence, it appears that Fennoscandia apparently bore luxuriantforests, for sub-fossil 'driftwood' now accumulates on the shores of several ofits remaining fragments. On Koluguev Island, for example, pieces of this woodare regularly swept up from some now-submerged offshore source 311 , while onSpitzbergen similar 'driftwood' occurs with whale remains several miles inlandat least 30ft (9m) above present sea level 312 . Similar elevated inlandlocations for essentially identical 'driftwood' occur on many of the northCanadian islands, where the wood often lies embedded in steep cliff faces. Atlatitude 75°N on Banksland (Melville Island), for example, pine cones and acornshave been met with 300ft (92m) above the present sea level 313 , and 'driftwood'occurs elsewhere on the island 314 . Fossil wood also occurs at a height of1,800ft (550m) on Ellesmere Island, wood which surprisingly is of Siberianorigin. It cannot be 'driftwood', because the north coast of the island ispermanently ice-bound 315 , nor can it have been transported glacially fromSiberia, which has never possessed an ice-sheet of any significance, and sendsno glaciers across the Arctic wastes to end at Ellesmere Island.All across the northern Parry Islands (Melville, Cornwallis, Bathurst and DevonIslands) of the Queen Elizabeth group innumerable pieces of 'driftwood' andmarine shells of 'Pleistocene' age frequently lie at heights well above the lineof a supposed 'Pleistocene' submergence of those territories 316 .* Many of theshells occur at quite extraordinary elevations, those on Somerset Island being1,000ft (300m) above sea level. Others on the Fosheim Peninsula - where theyoccupy \"several acres\" - a thousand feet higher, and still others on theGrinnell Peninsula of Devon Island 2,300ft (700m) above sea level 317 . Toaccount for their present occurrence, it has been suggested that the shells werepushed up to these elevations by a 'late Pleistocene' ice-sheet (theLauren-tian) 318 . Except for Banks and Victoria Islands, this ice-field iswidely alleged to have mantled the entire Canadian archipelago. As shownearlier, this is an erroneous concept.As so often occurs when examining the wreck of the 'Pleistocene' world, thehistory of the Siberian tundra vegetation proves to be surprisingly complex, forthe record there shows repeated changes between a cold, dry (steppe) ecology anda warm moisture-loving one. Further complications arise from the fact that avast belt of trees, including lime, oak, elm and alder stretched at one timefrom the Ural Mountains in the west, through the Altai Mountains far intoeastern Siberia 319 . The Ural and Altai ranges were among those which rose totheir present elevations at the end of 'Pleistocene' times. The evidence impliesthat during the 'Pleistocene' period, a temperate non-continental climateexisted across practically the whole of what is todaysouthern Siberia, having no counterpart in that region today.While trees today no longer grow further north than latitude 71 °N in northernand north-eastern Siberia, their remains are consistently encountered forhundreds of miles northward towards the Pole. The story they tell is veryimpressive. Some of the most striking vestiges of these vanished forests wereseen by Sannikov and Hedenstrom in 1806 during their discovery of the NewSiberian Islands. They found there abundant remnants of enormous ancientforests. Many of the trees were still standing where they had grown, but otherslay prostrate upon the perpetually-frozen ground 320 . Hedenstrom visitedKotelnyy Island, which lies at latitude 75°N, where he observed \"remarkable woodhills\" along its southern coast. Some of these 'hills' were as much as 180ft(55m) high and consisted almost wholly of the bituminous trunks of trees. On thesummits of the 'hills' the trunks stood vertically with the tops snapped off.Elaborating, another celebrated Arctic explorer, F R von Wrangell, said of thesebotanical graveyards, in which the bones of mammoths also abounded: \"Onascending these hills, fossilised charcoal is met with everywhere... coveredwith a petrification which is so hard it can scarcely be scraped off with aknife\" 321 . Lt Anjou visited these same islands on a later expedition and foundthe 'wood hills' extending for over 3 miles (5.2km) along the coast. Hedescribed the tree trunks as lying in clumps of fifty or more, oftenhorizontally, and noted that the wood was friable, black in colour with a slightgloss, and how - like charcoal - it did not burn when lighted but merely glowed,giving off a resinous odour 322 At various neighbouring localities, other treetrunks, converted into a bituminous substance, lay in great horizontal pilesalternating with sandstone layers containing tree stumps rooted in situ. Again,fossilised charcoal covered by ash, itself a petrification, was noticedeverywhere 323 .In 1829, G A Erman went to Great Lyakhov Island, and was so impressed by thescene confronting him that the obvious cause ofwhat had taken place was immediately apparent:On the summit of these hills (250-300ft high) [the trees] lie flung upon oneanother in the wildest disorder, forced upright in spite of gravitation, andwith their tops broken off or crushed, as if they had been thrown with greatviolence from the south on a bank, and there heaped up... So it is clear that atthe time when the elephants and the trunks of trees were heaped together, oneflood extended from the centre of the continent... (and) may have poured fromthe highest mountains through the rocky valleys. 324The tremendous extent of these ancient forests can be judged from the occurrenceon Maloi Island, in the Lyakhov group 100 miles (160km) to the south, of treestumps in situ exactly like those on the New Siberian Islands, accompanied insome cases by leaves and cones. In Whitely's opinion they prove that \"...whenthe mammoths and rhinoceroses lived in northern Siberia, these desolate islandswere covered with great forests and bore a luxuriant vegetation\" 325 .We venture to add that, when these 'Pleistocene' mammals roamed Siberia, theLyakhov Island and New Siberian Island were not islands at all, but portions ofthe continuous land that stretched northwards from the present Asiatic mainlandperhaps as far as the North Pole itself.Further glimpses of the former flora of these northern islands were unearthed byBaron von Toll, who visited these regions several times between 1895 and 1902.One of his expeditions was to Great Lyakhov Island, where he discovered atotally frozen specimen of Alnus fruticosa - a member of the alder family - 90ft(28m) in length and complete with roots, leaves and fruits. Nearby were theremains of willow trees lying alongside the bones of mammoths 326 .These same forests extended over great expanses of what is presently the northSiberian mainland, for their remnants are found on the shores of inland lakessuch as Lake Chastach. This lake lies on the tundraclose to the River Kolyma, and \"...every autumn throws up quantities ofbituminous fragments of wood... the shore [being] covered to a depth of 2ft(0.7m)\" 327 . Among the debris occur pieces of a solid substance like amber,considered to be the hardened resin of larch trees, but which, when burnt,failed to emit the odour of burning amber. Tree roots as fresh as if they hadonly just been severed from living trees, interspersed in black earth andice-clay composing a cliff some 30—35ft (9-llm) high were found by Hedenstromnear Malaya-Kuropalasik-Vaga. The nearest living woods, however, were over 100Russian versts (112km) distant 328 . Wrangell made similar discoveries in soilonly a short depth below the surface near Kolymsk on the Chukchee Peninsula, andin cliff facing the Polar Sea. He described the permanently frozen ground thereas containing \"...a great measure of ice which never thaws, mixed with a littleblack earth and clay, amongst which are a few long thin roots of trees\" 329 .Again, when Hedenstrom journeyed from the Indigirka River valley to Ulsiank, heobserved:On the tundra, equally remote from the present line of forest, among the steepsandy banks of the rivers and lakes, are found large birch trees, complete withbark, branches and roots. At first glance they appear to have been wellpreserved by the earth, but on digging them up they are found to be in athorough state of decay... the inhabitants of the neighbourhood use them asfuel, and designate these subterranean trees as Adamovshtshina, or of Adam'stime. The first living birch tree is not found nearer than three degrees to thesouth, and then only in the form of a shrub. 330Herr von Ruprecht, who also travelled across Siberia, observed on the ChernoiNos Peninsula, at the mouth of the Indiga River, where now only stunted birchbushes grow, upright rotten birch trees as tall as the average human being 331 .Nordenskiold also noted under the tundra of the Yenisei valley largetrees with their roots still fast in the frozen soil, although trees of the sametype thrive today only much further south. Masses of 'driftwood' and mammothbones occurred with these stumps 332 .Another interesting discovery was that of the shells of Helix schrencki whichstill retained well-preserved colours, near the mouth of the Awamka River inlatitudes 68° and 69°N, and the finding by Prof Schmidt of the same mollusc withplant fragments in frozen freshwater beds below Dudinsk, latitude 77°N, wellbeyond the present northern limits of the trees. Speaking of his journey, ProfSchmidt informs us that: \"On top of the tundra is often found Noah's wood andpeat moss with Planorbis limnaea, and a large species of Helix which I havenever found here alive\" 333 .Apart from mentioning that the remains of vast sub-fossil forests of oaks andother trees occur near Novgorod and Tver in Russia, where living specimenscannot now grow 334 , we should note that Erman ably summarised the distributionof the Siberian record as follows:It cannot escape notice that, as we go nearer the coast, the deposits of woodbelow the earth and also the deposits of bones which accompany the wood,increase in extent and frequency. Here, beneath the soil of Yakutsk the trunksof birch trees lie scattered, only singly, but on the other hand they form suchgreat and well-stored strata under the tundras, between the Yana and theIndigirka, that the Yakadirs never think of using any other fuel than fossilwood. They obtain it on the shores of lakes, which are continually throwing uptrunks of trees from the bottom... Thus, in NewSiberia, on the declivities facing the south lie hills 200-300ft high, formed ofdriftwood; the ancient origin of which, as well as the fossil wood in thetundras, anterior to the earth in its present state, strikes at once even themost uneducated hunters. They call both sorts of wood adamovchina or adamiticthings. 335Thus we find extensive areas within the Arctic Circle containing two kinds offossil fuel - one which drifted to the places where it is now accumulated, andthe second which plainly grew where it is now found. The distinction betweenthese two types of timber dates from very early times in Siberia, where theformer was called Adamshina (Adam's wood) and the latter Noahshina (Noah's wood)336 . That this timber should be traditionally associated with the NoachianDeluge is of more than passing interest, particularly in view of thegeologically recent occurrence of that disaster in a geographical region hostingthe frozen carcasses of hairy mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses."},{"pageContent":"The consistently tumultuous manner of deposition of all this ancient timber, andthe immense geographical extent of its remains, everywhere bespeaks of thesudden and violent demise of these huge forests. Likewise, the exceptionalpiling up at some localities, and the deep burial at others, of numberless treescould only have been accomplished on such a scale by tremendous water actionwholly indiscriminate in its activities, like that produced by the release ofthose comprising the abovementioned 'Water Mountain'.But if the eventual draining away of the Deluge waters seemed to herald the endof Earth's ordeals, one more was yet to come -refrigeration on a grand scale.Refrigerationfy^*WJiT°v^For almost 150 years it has been acknowledged that, geologically recently, Earthhas undergone a cold period epitomised by glacial conditions in both thenorthern and southern polar latitudes. However, no satisfactory theory has yetbeen proposed which actually explains what caused the 'Ice Age' in the firstplace. There appear to be no terrestrial conditions, as we know them, capable ofproducing the heat necessary to evaporate vast quantities of water to formcontinental-sized ice-sheets.As it was recognised that warm air and elevated land areas were necessary toproduce ice and rime (frost), the recent inception of the Gulf Stream in theNorth Atlantic was invoked as one of the prime causes of refrigeration\" 7 . Somehave even argued that the Deluge itself induced glacial conditions 338 . Itwould appear that the key to solving the so-called Tee Age' problem lies in theArctic, where the evidence has been frozen in a macabre fashion. The deeplyfrozen trunks of trees still bearing leaves and berries, the refrigeratedcarcasses of mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, musk-ox and other 'late Pleistocene'animals are preserved today in the same chaotic order in which they died andwere deposited. They represent a unique picture of a former world coming to asudden halt and remaining at that point until today.As we have already mentioned, the demise of mammoths and other animals was notcaused by the onset of glacial conditions, as many authorities would have usbelieve, for the evidence shows that they were, in most cases, already deadbefore they were abruptly frozen. Therefore, instead of a slow gradual freezeand buildup of glacial conditions over a prolonged period, as is generallyproposed, refrigera-tion was remarkably sudden and unrelenting. This was another of Phaeton'slegacies.The factors which led to this sudden glaciation have already been mentioned inother parts of the book. However, in order to trace a coherent sequence in theevents before us, they are briefly itemised below:• The tilting of the Earth from its previous axis immediately turned the 'GoldenAge' polar sub-temperate zones away from the Sun's heat;• The waters of the world became 'heaped up' in polar regions;• The induced tectonic changes caused massive volcanic discharges leading to'collapsed sky' conditions. In high latitudes these conditions effectivelyblocked out sunlight and solar warmth at ground level in all regions for a verylong time. This atmospheric pollution and the heat generated by crustaldislocations greatly increased precipitation 33 \" which fell as snow and sleet.In high latitudes, temperatures were thus severely reduced and held there foryears due to a virtual perpetual night;• After the release of the waters and the establishment of new oceanic andmeteorological regimes, circulating warm currents (such as the Gulf Stream)created fog banks along polar and sub-polar coastlines. Enhancing thealready-thick cloud cover blanketing those regions, this led to the formation ofice and rime. Furthermore, practically all land surfaces in these regions hadbeen drenched, even waterlogged, by the Deluge, and this undoubtedly ensured theperpetuation there of a general refrigeration. In lower313latitudes, this waterlogged ground led eventually to the formation of numerouspeat beds. Thus, the Deluge and the Gulf Stream indirectly contributed to theglaciation.Bodies of former Deluge water trapped in valleys and depressions in highlatitudes would have quickly frozen solid. Ice-cliffs and buried ice lenticles,as well as the strings and ribbons of ice accompanying biological debris in theAlaskan and Siberian 'drift' are surviving remnants of trapped Deluge water.Glacialists supporting the conventional notion of alternating glacial andinterglacial episodes have recognised the abruptness of both the beginning 340and end 341 of the last glacial period in their scheme of events. Manyauthorities now hold that this was swift and rapid, two terms repeatedly used toconvey the speed of first the ice build-up and, later, its dissipation. Lamb andWoodroffe, for example, have argued that after the inception of the last glacialperiod there was a \"...swift establishment of ice over northern andnorth-western Europe, and over some extensive hinterland in North America...within 100-500 years\" 342 . Others have suggested still shorter times 343 .The inception of Greenland's present ice-sheet, considered at some lengthearlier, has lately been attributed to massive 'postglacial vulcanism 344 . Wehave repeatedly seen that Phaeton's visit abruptly generated severe vulcanicityaround 11,500 years ago -a date strikingly close to that (11,000 years BP) nowwidely held to mark the end of alleged 'Ice Age' and the beginning of Holocene(Recent) times, when prodigious quantities of volcanic ash were deposited withinthe aforementioned Alaskan 'muck' beds enveloping countless diluvially-entombedremnants of late 'Pleistocene' animals.The scale, extent and abruptness of this vulcanicity worldwide, and theattendant atmospheric pollution, was so great that the inevitable loweringthereby of temperatures globally, especially in high latitudes, wasautomatically rapid. Direct connections between widespread severe late'Pleistocene' vulcanism and profound climatic changes (glaciation included) havebeen repeatedly stressed on previous pages and have formed the subject ofsuccessive studies by, among many others, Lamb 345 , Hammer 34 \", Aubert de laRiie 347 , Nixon 348 and Pollack 349 , and tie in closely with the swiftenvironmental changes which, as noted previously, were prominent features of theYounger Dryas episode.The great lenticles and ribbons of ice which locally penetrate the Alaskan'muck' beds, just as they do in equivalent deposits containing similar organicremains in Siberia, were clearly frozen more or less at, or very shortly after,the actual accumulation of the beds. In other words, the freezing of these beds,the deposition of the volcanic ash layers within them, the slaughter of theinnumerable animals they now yield, and the aqueous (diluvial) mixing of thisassorted debris into chaotic 'muck' deposits was extraordinarily rapid. Thesingular evidence of the suddenly and permanently refrigerated animal carcassesfound in both the Siberian and Alaskan deposits (see Appendix A) not onlyoverwhelmingly confirms this but suggests that in at least those regionsrefrigeration was virtually instantaneous and occurred during the final stage ofthe Deluge phase of the giant calamity we are outlining here.Most significantly, several writers have urged that the radical climatic changesof the so-called glacial and interglacial episodes are explained only by majorvulcanism arising from discontinuous motions of disturbed crustal plates 350 .This is precisely what occurred at the time of the Phaeton disaster and in theperiod immediately afterwards. The disaster apparently set in motion achain-reaction, with one set of effects leading inevitably to the next, and ofwhich the latest and less severe are still being experienced today.In our opinion, the growth of the present polar ice-caps did not lead to thedevelopment of the vast ice-sheets advocated by Geikie and Penck, but rather toa multiplici-ty of glaciers (many of very large size) on all the recently elevated plateauxand mountain ranges. These even formed on high land in tropical regions. Thus,glaciers descended Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to 3,000ft (900m) lower than theirremnants do today 351 . Others even then existed on the equator 352 . Worldwide,they represented what is now termed the Little Ice Age 3 \".Between 11,500 and 7,500 years BP, these glaciers produced a massiverearrangement of' many superficial 'drift' deposits, relocated detachedboulders, left thousands of moraines and influenced climates locally. But notall moraines were or are necessarily of glacial origin 354 . Glaciers proceededat different speeds depending on local conditions, sometimes retreating andre-advancing several times over the same routes. In doing so, they locallymodified existing mountain valleys, fiords and hillsides, and carved outmountainside depressions such as cirques. Only very occasionally did they uniteto form ice-sheets of limited extent. These actions did not cause the polishing,fluting, gouging or striation of rock strata which, though commonly attributedto supposed ice action during the Tee Age', were made during the Phaetonconfrontation before glaciation commenced. Thus, while the ice-sheets so belovedof orthodox glacialists never really existed, the glaciers most certainly did.The glaciers of today are the last vestiges of a frigid era that ought moreproperly to be styled the 'Glacier Age' rather than the Tee Age'.Obviously these glaciers did not all form at the same rate, for their growthdepended on variations of snowfall, the latitude of their occurrence and thegradient of the hill or mountainside down which they descended. Scientists havecalculated some reliable dates for the initiation and maximum expansion ofseveral famous glacier (including the Mer de Glace on Mont Blanc and the RhoneGlacier), and these not only correlate with the 11,500 years BP date we haveadvocated for the Phaeton disaster, but show that the entire 'Glacier Age'occurred within the Holocene period. Incidentally, the dategiven for the great tectonic changes which occurred on Spitzbergen andneighbouring islands and for their glaciation is also Holocene 355 .It would appear that the conditions producing the growth of the glaciers weregeologically of short duration and lasted until early historical times - say6,000-7,000 years ago in Eurasia and as late as 3,000 years ago in NorthAmerica. Thus, the terrible Fimbul winter of Norse tradition is quite credible,and is in keeping with the belief of the Aymara Indians of Andean Peru that,after the Deluge, the mightiest of the gods punished the wicked by throwing acoat of snow and ice over the whole country 356 .Even the Polynesians, now living in idyllic surroundings, have memories aboutearly times when their gods and ancestors lived in severe wintry conditions. S PSmith noted that: \"The Tongans have also a tradition of the ice-covered ocean,which they call Taifatu, which means the thick fat-like or congealed ocean, andwhich some of their ancestors had been in ages ago\" 357 . And Brown observedthat: \"Most of the Polynesian gods and demigods of the underworld haveindications in their careers of having come from a land of bitter winter\" 358 .It is surely significant, therefore, that in the Babylonian Talmud a celestialbody known as Kimah is described as the source of 'great cold'; and that anancient Jewish legend states that a change in, or of, Kimah was responsible forthe Deluge 35 \". Kimah was regarded either as a planet or the constellation ofthe Pleiades, which, as the undermentioned details suggest, was a mostinteresting concept.The ancient association of a period of intense cold on Earth with some celestialinfluence is also found in the Old Testament, which links the icy phase with thePleiades and with Mazzaroth (alias Phaeton/Marduk), for we read:Out of whose womb came forth theice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?Table 5CPhaeton's record compared:geological/biological, astrophysical and traditional.Geological/Biological (factual)(all dated 'late Pleistocene')Deposition of 'drift' and siltChanged bio-ecological regimes Changed polar axisVariable axial rotation -length of day fluctuatesChanged topography with: land elevation/subsidence, mountainelevation/subsidence, disappearance and creation of seas, desert formationChanged water levels Conflagration in some areasDestruction of flora and faunaDust in the atmosphereFloodingGeoidal deformationGlobal crustal fracturing with: crustal shortening, expansion, inversion,overthusting, tilting, lateral displacements, coastal warpingMagnetic reversal with: anomalous magnetic losses, anomalous magnetic trendsMassive lava/magma flowsMarine displacementsPeriod of intense coolingSudden onset of glacial conditions in northern hemisphereUni-directional 'meteoric' fall in northern hemisphereUni-directional movement of huge 'erratics'Uni-directional striation flow across northern hemisphereWorldwide vulcanismAstrophysical(theoretical)Change in atmosphere, Nitric acidformed and chemical reactionsdue to release of energyChange in polar axis of rotation Slowed rotational speedChange in length of day, year and seasonsNoise from sonic booms and earthquakesRise in temperatures above boiling point of waterAtmospheric pollution: low cloud-cover in high latitudesGiant tides raised and pulled polewards - when released caused global floodingGeoidal deformationGlobal earthquakes.

Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in hisseason?™Here, perhaps, is an indication of the celestial direction from which Phaetonarrived -from that of the Pleiades and Orion.So in antiquity at least, the notion of great terrestrial cold was directlyassociated with significant celestial events and with a periodof great darkness, and to have quickly followed a worldwide Deluge. Thesetraditions, therefore, are not only consistent with one another, but alsoreflect the correct sequence of physical processes and effects traceable byscientific investigation. Furthermore, they also largely coincide with thetheoretical propositions of astrophysicists respecting the probable effectssustained by Earth in the event of a close cosmic fly-by. Table 5C gives acomparison of these effects. Surely such harmony between essentially disparatematerial cannot be fortuitous.REFERENCES1. Bellamy, H S. 1945.

The world's topography had been largely rearranged.Prior to the disaster, the general trend of the major landmasses appears to havebeen east-west; after it they were aligned in a predominately north-southdirection - as is still plainly discernible today.New mountain ranges and lofty plateaux had been upheaved, and deep gorges andhuge fissures had come into being. Unimaginably large eruptions of magma, lavaand other volcanic ejecta, including steam and gases, had attended thesederangements. Former seas and lakes had been drained or drastically reduced -the displaced waters (the biblical Deluge) roaring as immense irresistiblewatery avalanches over the newly emerging landscape, as they sought new basins.Only the very largest obstacles withstood these churning torrents.Where the waters had met heated rock surfaces and erupting lava or magma,violent explosions occurred, wrenching huge boulders and lesser debris fromparent strata and hurling them great distances in all directions, as prodigiousclouds of steam rose to drench and scald adjacent districts. In many regions,once the Deluge waters had drained away, countless boulders of everycomposition, size and shape dotted the landscape.Astounding quantities of gravel, sand, clay, mud and silt had accumulated onhillsides -even on hilltops - and had spread over valley floors and acrossplains. Such old rivers as still existed now flowed along highly modifiedcourses or in entirely new directions. Wholly new drainage systems, occasionedbythe youthful topography, were the norm. In some places lakes and lagoons left byreceding Deluge waters were extensive but shallow, and certain traditionsdescribe how creatures of many kinds - and the ancestors of particular humantribes - crept or swam in them in their quest to find dry land 1 .Organic debris had been deposited in all sorts of localities. Intense waterpressures had rammed these remains into fissures, crevices and the innermostrecesses of tortuous caverns - totally without regard to the size or class ofthe organisms concerned. Gargantuan rafts of mangled vegetation lay here andthere in thick banks as far as the eye could see, while, protruding through orlying upon the surface, everywhere, lay the corpses of animals of all kinds.These occurred singly, in small groups or as great assemblages congregatedlocally by arresting obstacles or trapped within newly-formed lagoons, dammedvalleys, lakes or bogs.Accordingly, the stench of death and decay must have pervaded many districts,especially in lower, warmer latitudes, where unpolluted water must have beenrare and the risk of pestilence high for an appreciable time. The offensiveodours eddying out from bone-caves (crammed with countless cadavers ordismembered parts thereof), and from the decaying banks of vegetation, must havebeen truly frightful in the weeks immediately following Phaeton's departure.Precipitation (rainfall) would probably have been intense, particularly in highlatitudes, due to the tremendous atmospheric pollution caused by the massivevolcanic activity in virtually all hemispheres. This pollution would haveenhanced the 'collapsed sky' conditions already established during Phaeton'svisit, so that a gloomy shroud continued to envelop much of the Earth. Thisgloom, and the resultant progressively cold conditions in high latitudes due toa blotting out of sunlight and solar warmth at ground level, together with therapid growth of glaciers and ice-fields, were vivid features of these dire earlypost-catastrophic days.Certainly they are enshrined in ancient traditions and memories the world over:and these, very significantly, almost invariably place them shortly after theretreat of the Deluge waters and the passing of the main catastrophe.The Survivors«Tsi%4 ! j.r***sr»While traditional descriptions of the Phaeton disaster reflect an almostidentical pattern of events world-wide, great diversity exists in the waysspecific groups of people are said to have survived that ordeal. Instantlyrecalled are arks, rafts, great canoes, uprooted trees and other floatingobjects. Yet, although these devices could at best accommodate only limitednumbers of individuals - and some, like the tomtom drum of the Annamese hero 2and the ball of rubber or pitch in the Pima Indian legend 3 , could serve butone person. Those who entrusted themselves to floating objects feature intraditions as true Deluge-heroes.Among these were people who deliberately constructed vessels (arks) before theonset of the Deluge - usually on the advice of others alleged to have superioror 'divine' advance knowledge of the impending disaster. Several widelyscattered traditions refer to arks being built on mountains far inland 4 . Andthere were others who, perhaps ignoring clear signs and portents, or who weresimply caught unawares, literally commandeered the first sizable floating objectavailable to them when the disaster broke.Another group of survivor legends gives mountain tops as sanctuaries or placeswhere arks, 'swimming houses' or the like came to rest with the ebbing off ofthe Deluge waters. With the terrifying arrival of the Deluge waters, safety wasprobably instinctivelysought on the nearest high ground. As we have already mentioned, there areaccounts of mad, panicky scrambles up mountain sides by those hoping to avoiddrowning 5 .It is noteworthy that several of the mountain-top survivors had, like thoseurged elsewhere to build arks and great vessels, received 'divine' advice toseek safety on particular peaks before the onset of the Deluge. In thewell-known Greek story of Philemon and Baucis, for example, the righteousPhrygian couple were taken by the gods Zeus and Hermes to the top of a loftymountain to escape the fate reserved for their fellow men, who perished shortlyafterwards in a Deluge 6 . A similar account concerns two human pairs who becamethe ancestors of the Sing-Pohs of Assam. They had previously been urged by oneof their deities to ascend Mt Singrabhum so that they might survive the Deluge 7. The neighbouring Lakhers relate how their forefathers found asylum on MtLeiparang during the same event. The name Leiparang, incidentally, signifies'Old Earth' because the mountain, allegedly, was never submerged by the Deluge 8.Sometimes 'divine intervention' was seen as occurring only after the climb to amountain summit had been accomplished, the hard-pressed refugees (animalsincluded) being offered sanctuary in floating vessels, as in a Lithuaniantradition 9 . This association of human and animal refugees crowding a Flood-girt mountaintop is similar to the Peruvian Deluge legend involving the Andeanpeak of Ancasmarca'\". Similar beliefs were preserved also among Formosans andPolynesians' 1 .Before leaving these fragments of prehistory, we should emphasise that themountain-top survivors were seldom likely to see clearly the surroundingturmoil. Almost all the accounts describe a combination of driving rain, furiouswinds and a thick gloom which for a long period obscured the Sun, Moon andstars. The South American Caingang Indians described the darkness as 'pitchy'and as punctuated by howls, piercing screeches and other unearthly sounds 12 .These were presumably the peculiar sounds of hurricane force winds and possiblyalso of the passage through the atmosphere of still-falling cosmic debris.Parallelling these flood traditions is another category recording how people andanimals survived the disaster in caves. Many examples could be cited and in PartThree we mentioned the reactions of the refugees to the chaos and din that ragedoutside their sanctuaries. Elsewhere, we have mentioned bone-caves yielding theremains of sizable groups of human beings, as though those particular asylumshad been ill-selected and their sheltering occupants overwhelmed by gases ortumultuous water action.It is probably significant that most accounts indicate that caverns were soughtmore as protection from super-hurricane winds, conflagration 13 and cosmicbombardment 14 , than from the subsequent Deluge. Given all the circumstancesunder discussion, it is obvious that deep caverns would have been ideal refugesfrom missiles and fire, but extremely dangerous shelters against rampagingwater.Some refugees became buried in caverns, as earth and rocks were piled up at theentrances by 'drift' borne by the Deluge waters. In Part Two we noted severalinstances of completely blocked-up bone-caves. Some groups, like the cruel raceof the Tahoe legend, were entombed permanently 15 , but others, like theLenni-Lenape Indians of Delaware, tell how their forefathers were once buried inthe Earth, but survived the ordeal by successfully digging their way out 16 .Part Six: Phaeton's Legacy 329Probably the most complete memory of this kind is preserved amongst the NavajoIndians. It describes how:...at one time all the nations - Navajos, Pueblos, Coyoteros and white people -lived together underground, in the heart of a mountain, near the river San Juan.Their food was meat, which they had in abundance, for all kinds of game wereclosed up with them in their cave; but their light was dim, and only endured fora few hours each day... 17Later they successfully dug their way to the surface, only to find themselves onthe outside of a mountain surrounded by water. Shortly afterwards, the watershad ebbed away, leaving a sea of mud, and the legend continues:Then the men and the animals began to come up from their cave, and their comingup required several days. First came the Navajos... then came the Pueblos andother Indians... [and] lastly came the white people, who started off at once forthe rising sun, and were lost sight of for many winters... When these nationslived underground they all spoke one tongue; but, with the light of day and thelevel of earth, came many languages. The earth was at this time very small, andthe light was quite as scanty as it had been down below, for there was as yet noheaven, no sun, nor moon, nor stars. 18This remarkable narrative, which contains several elements repeated in variousother independent cave-survivor legends, forms a graphic account of the burialof a remnant of early humanity with many animals in a cave on a mountain. Whatburied them is not actually specified, although it had blocked up the cavern'sentrance with material that could be dug. The people evidently subsisted on theanimals for a considerable time, during which not only did the cave remainmostly dark and gloomy, but so did the outside world. The absence of heavenlyluminaries almost certainly relates to the 'collapsed sky' conditions prevalentthen.On eventually receding, the water left everything covered with wet mud, andthis, after slowly drying out, apparently enabled various survivor groups to setoff in particular directions. The reference to 'white people' who apparentlywished to sever their association with the Indians, is especially interesting.It could be concluded from this action that they regarded themselves asbelonging to a different race. It is surely pertinent that almost all traditionswhich refer to culture-heroes (virtually every one of whom was activeimmediately after the Deluge) describe them as white, tall, bearded andinvariably superior to the aboriginal peoples among whom they appeared -oftensuddenly - to impart laws, crafts and useful information.One such culture-hero, Caboy by name, allegedly brought the ancestors of theBrazilian Karaya Indians out of a 'subterranean world' following the GreatFlood'\". Elsewhere, another culture-hero, using a golden spade-like implement,dug Amerindian Deluge survivors out of a blocked-up cavern 20 . The hill tribesknown as the Pankhoos and Bungogees, who inhabit the Chittagong area ofBangladesh, preserve a similar tradition. They recall how, after the recessionof the Deluge waters \"...their ancestors came out of a cave in the earth, underthe guidance of a chief named Tlandrokpah 21 .The early post-diluvian activities of this superior culture-bearing white raceare chroni-cled in numerous traditions distributed globally, but are regrettably toocomplex and important to discuss adequately here. They will, however, be fullyconsidered in a later volume devoted to unravelling this now almost-forgottenera of organised endeavour.Clearly, members of several different races sometimes took refuge in the samecaverns or on the same mountain peaks, being as often as not complete strangersto one another. Such mixed gatherings were not expected, for, faced with anall-encompassing common danger, the sole aim of every individual must surelyhave been survival. Previous social considerations such as race, rank, gender orage, became meaningless instantly. It is, therefore, significant that echoes ofprecisely this scenario appear in the Book of St. John the Divine:And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefcaptains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hidthemselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains. 22By its very nature the Phaeton disaster affected all men indiscriminately. Smallcross-sections of pre-catastrophic society found themselves sharing commonrefuges and, those groups which somehow managed to survive, entered thepost-diluvian world together, equally destitute, and bereft of basic necessities23 .An Uncertain FutureeTs^ts-jiiSsr\"*Many garbled and incomplete recollections have come down to us of the dismalperiod characterising earliest Holocene times. They describe not only theever-worsening climate but humanity's general poverty and wretchedness. Thesedeleterious after-effects of the catastrophe were cata-logued by the Babylonians in the Atra-Hasis, their account of the Great Floodand its aftermath. In it, we read:The womb of the earth did not bear... vegetation did not sprout... people werenot seen... the black fields became white... thebroad plain was choked with salt... [and:] For one year they ate couch grass...for the second they suffered itch... the third year came - their features [werealtered] by hunger. 24The reference to salt-choked plains is echoed on the other side of the world,when the Kwakiult Indians of British Columbia recall how:...when the flood had subsided there was no fresh water to be found. They werenigh on dying from thirst, and chewed plants to obtain moisture. But then agreat rain came, very heavy and very long, which filled the valleys with freshwater lakes and rivers, which have remained there ever since. 25The undrinkable character of the pre-rain waters are also alluded to in theBundahish. This states that the \"poison and venom of the noxious creatures\"which had perished in the Deluge \"were all mixed up in the water, and the watersbecame quite salt.\" 26 Elsewhere, the waters are said to have been made 'bitter'27 .The Norse Eddas refer explicitly to terrible cold - the Fimbul Winter: \"Themighty, the great, the iron winter...\" 28 and the Elder Edda adding:TJie sunshine blackens In the summers thereafter. And the weather grows bad.According to the Younger Edda:...as soon as the streams that are called Elivogs [the rivers flowing under theice] had come so far... [they] ...turned into ice. And when this ice stopped andflowed no more, then gathered over it the drizzling rain... and froze into rime,and one layer of ice was laid upon another clear into Ginungagap... All thatpart of Ginungagap that turns north was filled with thick and heavy ice andrime, and everywhere were drizzling rain and gusts... 29Darkness and great cold were remembered everywhere as having reduced a greatmajor-ity of human survivors to pitiable physical and mental states. A prayeraddressed by the Mexican Aztecs to their god Tezcatlipoca evidently refers tothis epoch and runs as follows:Know, O Lord... the men have no garments, nor the women, to cover themselveswith, but only certain rags rent in every part, that allow the air and the coldto pass everywhere... With great toil and weariness they scrape together enoughfor each day, going by mountain and wilderness seeking their food; so faint andenfeebled are they that their bowels cleave to their ribs, and all their bodyre-echoes with hollowness, and they walk as people afrighted, the face and bodyin likeness of death... they draw a rag over them at night, and so sleep; therethey throw down their bodies, and the bodies of the children thou hast giventhem. For the misery that they grow up in, for the filth of their food, for thelack of covering, their faces are yellow, and all their bodies of the colour ofthe earth. They tremble with cold, and for leanness they stagger in walking.They go weeping and sighing, and full of sadness... though they stay by a fire,they find little heat. 3 \" (Our italics).Many were obliged to eat whatever they could find. Food must have been mostlyrecently-annihilated plants and animals, and many survivors must have died thenas much from food poisoning as from cold and hunger. Fresh food was undoubtedlyscarce or non-existent in many regions, and several districts must have remaineduninhabited, and uninhabitable, for decades.Different effects were experienced in warmer latitudes, but even there theprevailing damp allegedly turned such food as then existed mouldy 31 .In the Ten Stems, an ancient Chinese work, which divides world history into tenperiods or stages, we read: \"At Wu - the sixth stem -the Darkness and the Lightunite with injurious effects - all things become solid (freeze into ice), andthe Darkness destroys the growth of all things. At Kung - the seventhstem - the Darkness nips all things.\" 32 Another ancient Chinese record, theTwelve Branches, similarly reports: \"K'wun-tun stands for the period of chaos,the cold midnight darkness. It is said that with it all things began togerminate in the hidden recesses of the underworld.\" 33 In the Ten Stems welearn, similarly, that: \"At Jin - the ninth stem - the Light begins to nourishall things in the recesses below.\" 34 These would seem to be references to thegermination of seeds and plant roots swept by the Deluge waters into caves andfissures.After the Phaeton upheaval people's diet differed appreciably from that whichhad prevailed previously. In Genesis there is more than a hint that antediluvianMan was vegetarian:And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is uponthe face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a treeyielding seed; to you it shall be your meat. 35The same source then informs us that, following the Deluge, God said to Noah andhis family:And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth,and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and uponall the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thingthat liveth shall be meat for you. 36In other words, post-diluvial people became omnivorous by being obliged to eatmeat. Ancient Chinese annals mention the same thing: \"At first even the rulersdwelt in caves and desert places, eating raw flesh and drinking blood\" 37 . Notimprobably, this memory refers to the consumption of animal carcasses, whenrapidly-falling temperatures in high latitudes might have permitted meat toremain edible for an appreciable time. The description of the flesh as rawcertainly suggests this. We should not forget that frozen Siberian mammoth meatis known to have been devoured in historical times by wolves and human beings(see Appendix A).That dead meat was indeed eaten is indicated elsewhere in Genesis, whichmentions how God instructed Noah: \"But the flesh with the life thereof, which isthe blood thereof, shall ye not eat\" 38 . This was an injunction that livinganimals were not to be eaten: survivors of animal populations decimated by thecatastrophe were to be left to multiply and replenish stocks.That meat eating became a necessity for many Deluge survivors is clearly impliedin the following account of how searches for plant foods proved unsuccessful:They sought for food everywhere. For nine days they roamed about, but found nonesuch as they used to eat in Paradise. 'We used to have angels' food then', theycomplained. 39Occasionally, people seem to have supplemented a meat diet with other food.Charred ostrich eggshells, radiocarbon-dated at 10,720 ±132 years BP, found in arock-shelter in Tanzania 40 , suggest that eggs and perhaps birds were eaten inthose difficult days.Meat eating usually meant the removal of the animal's hide or pelt. Severaltraditions describe how some superior race (the Sarku?) made garments from theseskins for the less expert survivors of Adamic humanity. Genesis greatlysimplified these relationships, where the superior race is represented by Godand the needy survivors by Adam and Eve 41 .This suggests that the making or wearing of garments had been rare amongordinary antediluvian humanity, accustomed to equable 'Golden Age' climates, andthat they lacked the knowledge to manufacture clothing. Nevertheless, one earlycave drawing of a clothed individual evidently dating from the period underdiscussion shows that unexpectedly sophisticated garments were made then andcould only have resulted through long familiarity with clothes-making generally.Yet the production of such attire required not only particular skills but alsotools - and tools were probably in short supply during those wretched times.Nevertheless, some implements did exist even in those desperate years, and werepresumably made by pre-catastrophic peoples familiar with their manufacture anduse before the onset of the Phaeton disaster. Very well-made curved bone sewingneedles having small eyes, attributed to the Solutrean culture, existed inFrance as far back as c20,000 years BP These indicate that fitted garments,probably of skin or leather, were made at a surprisingly early stage.Solutrean arrowheads and knives are also beautifully' made, and it is hard toimagine that they were produced by barbarian peoples groping for survival. Onthe contrary,they evince every sign of having been produced by well developed, longestablished techniques.The references in traditions and ancient sagas everywhere to the dreadfulphysical conditions and general poverty during early post-catastrophic timeshave no real meaning, of course, unless the situations described actually onceexisted. Very significantly, however, those situations are precisely those whichcan be expected to have followed global disruption on the scale of the Phaetondisaster. The future of humankind at this time was unquestionably veryuncertain.The Stone Age arrivesg-^Sit^f^fisr^Early post-diluvian social degradation was almost certainly occasioned as muchby lack of adequate tools as by adverse physical and climatic conditions.Indeed, such degradation was exacerbated not only by an absence of tools but, insome communities, by an actual ignorance of tools.Knowledge of tools amongst early post-diluvians depended upon whetherindividuals had formerly belonged to the apparently small ruling class or to theseemingly large semi-ignorant masses: semi-ignorant because, although many haddoubtless seen the great antediluvian buildings, large boats (arks included),irrigation systems, pottery, metallic utensils and weaponry specificallymentioned in innumerable traditions, they had not themselves designed, built orused those inventions, and few possessed the skills to do so. But what firmevidence is there that such diverse artificial creations existed before thePhaeton disaster? After all, we are referring to a period 11,500 years or moreago, and which orthodox history views in a very different light. Strangelyenough,there is quite a large corpus of evidence, both circumstantial and factual,indicating that civilised communities existed on Earth before that shockingcalamity.Many of the previously-cited traditions refer unmistakably to variousantediluvian structures (for example, houses, temples, towers, canals), landvehicles (carts, chariots), aquatic vessels (rafts, canoes and arks) andimplements (ploughs, bows, arrows, spades). Elaborating on this theme, Bellamyhas pointed out that:Many myths tell of tools having been saved more or less accidentally (quiteapart from the elaborate ark myths, some of which even describe the salvage of alot of quite unnecessary odds and ends). In various North American Indian mythsfire-drills are mentioned, in others stone implements, pots, bows, jewellry arereported to have been saved. Some myths say that the people who had escaped onrafts, and had saved certain personal belongings, believed that the waters wouldnever subside unless they sacrificed something from their store. Such savedtools were frequently stolen from their owners, probably because of theirefficiency, though the myths usually stress the 'magical' properties of the'other-worldly' implements. 42Scholars have either ignored or dismissed these essentially circumstantialreferences as fanciful or allegorical devices. Latterly, however, the samematerial has been adopted by writers who, possessing scant knowledge and livelyimaginations, have concocted outrageous hypotheses purporting to identifyculture-heroes as prehistoric astronauts and the various artefacts as theproducts of their supposed technology. Viewed individually, none of theseintriguing references is either important or verifiable. Assessed collectively,however, they form a recurrent theme in the symphony of traditional worldhistory, and as such increase in significance. Nevertheless, they will foreverremain scientifically worthless without supportive material evidence, and it isonly when we consider physical artefacts that they acquire any value.Among the physical evidences for exceedingly early civilisation are theinnumerable stone walls retaining agricultural terraces on the slopes of thePeruvian and Bolivian Andes. These occur at several places well above thepresent line of perpetual snow, where cultivation is no longer possible. Unlessmuch warmer climates occurred here relatively recently they can only haveattained their present elevation when the mountains were upheaved. As notedpreviously, the latest uprise of the Andes occurred at the close of theso-called 'Pleistocene' times, about 11,500 years ago.Cyclopean stone ruins now 13,000ft (4,000m) above sea level at Tiahuanacu, SSEof Lake Titicaca, and apparently similar lithic structures on islands in thelake, seem to be equally ancient 43 . Their enormous size and extent testifyeloquently to markedly different environmental conditions and populationdensities throughout that region in the distant past. Commenting specifically onthe Tiahuanacu ruins, but in terms equallyapplicable to all these ancient stone structures, Sir Clements Markham onceobserved:The city covered a large area, built by highly skilled masons, and with the useof enormous stones. One stone is 36ft long by 7ft, weighing 170 tons; another26ft by 16ft by 16ft. Apart from the monoliths of ancient Egypt, there isnothing to equal this in any other part of the world. The movement and placingof such monoliths point to a dense population, to an organised government andconsequently to a large area under cultivation, with arrangements for theconveyancing of supplies from various directions. There must have been anorganisation combining skill and intelligence with power and administrativeability. 44The undoubtedly genuine discovery, noted earlier, of a carved figurine at agreat depth under 'Pleistocene' lava near Nampa, Idaho, represents the handiworkof some very early cultured race. So, also, do the well-made granite dishes inundisturbed auriferous (gold-bearing) gravels containing the remains of typical'late Pleistocene' plants and animals (including the celebrated Calaverasskull), far below the surface in California. As argued previously, all theseartefacts are very ancient indeed. So are the following.Vessels of vesicular basalt were obtained in 1880 from gravels also yieldingbones of the extinct giant ground-sloth Mylodon, near the Klamath River,California. 45 Many comparable finds from the same Californian gravels werelisted by Dr James Southall in 1882 and are collectively of much interest. Theseinclude a mortar found 150ft (46m) below the surface in gravel capped byvolcanic deposits at San Andreas; a triangular polished stone hatchet 75ft (23m)below ground level 300ft (90m) inside a mine tunnel penetrating Table Mountain;many stone dishes, pestles, mortars and other carved lithic utensils found alongwith bones of elephants and mastodons at a place called 'Murphy's' in TuolumneCounty; and numerous grooved discs, mortars, and other stone objects at variousdepths in gravels subjacent to volcanic deposits in the same district 46 . Thecuriousgrooved discs were investigated in a special study by Dr Eberhart in 1961 47 .The unknown makers of these artefacts also used a circular vessel having threelegs and a spout made of lava, 'hard as iron'.By 1888, as many as 300 stone mortars had been found in undisturbed gravelscapped by basalt at Cherokee in Butte County, California. Interestingly, thesegravels were deposited by an ancient river pre-dating the present, quitedifferently oriented, river system there, and have even been observed on thevery summits of neighbouring mountains 6,000ft (1,850m) high. Geologists haveassigned them to either 'Upper Pleistocene' or 'glacial' times 48 . Still morestone objects, including bowl-shaped mortars, graceful sandstone pestles,serpentine cups and steatite tobacco pipes, have been retrieved fromconsiderable depths in these gravels near Santa Barbara, California 4y , whileessentially similar stone bowls, often very well made, have been dredged fromso-called 'late Pleistocene' deposits off the Californian coast 5 \". It is verysignificant that these gravelsand volcanic beds occupy the valleys indenting the flanks of the Sierra Nevadaand Sacramento Valley\", which exhibit many geological features (eg, striated andpolished rock surfaces) conventionally ascribed to former glacial action butwhich we contend were products of other agencies acting tumul-tuously at thetime of the Phaeton disaster.Particularly telling evidence of very early cultured endeavour came to light in1940, when Dr Asbjourn Ousdal - a dental practitioner and amateur fossilcollector - unexpectedly discovered an inscribed bowl in a block of solidsandstone near the summit of a hill in the Santa Barbara range. Part of the rimof this bowl, illustrated here for the first time (fig 6.1), bears strange,elaborate and carefully executed script-like signs or decorative devices. Inconsidering the great antiquity of this relic, we should recall: a) thepreviously-mentioned stone utensils in the Santa Barbara gravels; b) Dr Bower'sreport on the bones of cetacean and other marine mammals in Pliocene deposits(later identified as 'Pleistocene') met with \"...especiallypicture82 [images/picture82.jpg]Fig 6.1. Mortar and pestle found in gravels in California. Courtesy ofGeological Society of America.picture83 [images/picture83.jpg]Fig 6.2. Prehistoric inscribed bowl, Santa Barbara Range, California.picture84 [images/picture84.jpg]Fig 6.3. Prehistoric iron chain.along the sides and crests of the Santa Paula mountains...\" and the hills justnorth of Buenaventura\", near the Santa Barbara range; and c) that the sandstoneenveloping this bowl had been upheaved with the hill of which it was a part.Equally noteworthy is the portion of an iron chain accidentally discovered insolid sandstone exposed in the side of a deep ravine, at the junction of Clarkand Nye counties with the California stateline, by the late Frederick G Hehr ofLos Angeles during 1952. Hehr, an artesian well specialist, collected thecuriosity and supplied the photograph of it, published here for the first time(fig 6.3). The sandstone lay 37ft (11m) below the rim of the ravine wall - arather modest depth compared to the 184ft (56m) at which undoubted fragments ofa paved road or causeway which were found by Hehr, protruding from a canyon wall13 miles (21km) SSE of Lake Owens, westward of the notorious Death Valley,California\".No less interesting is the copper coin-like object (fig 6.4) discovered at LawnRidge, Illinois, last century, described by Prof Alex-ander Winchell in 188r 4 . So, too, the copper knife found close to amuch-decayed Mastodon leg-bone, 5—6ft (1.6m) below ground level in undisturbed'drift' gravel near Stirling, Illinois 55 .Before leaving North American evidence, of which much more could be cited, weshould mention the beautifully-fashioned plummetlike object of sienitediscovered 30ft (9.2m) below ground level during the sinking of a well atWoodbridge in the San Toaquim Valley, California. Embedded in undisturbedPleistocene gravel, the object was so expertly ground and polished that ProfFoster considered it to be \"...an exhibition of the lapidiary's skill superiorto anything yet furnished by the Stone Age of either continent\" 56 . Theimplement had been drilled by a process which, instead of producing a uniformgauge, resulted in a rimmed aperture, the rimming having been started from eachend. Such technological accomplishments bear eloquent testimony for theexistence of a civilized race at this early time.But if the foregoing fails to impress as certain evidence of wide-rangingtechnical ability before Phaeton's visit, how does one viewpicture85 [images/picture85.jpg]Fig 6.4. Copper coin, found buried 114ft underground in Illinois.the ruins of a well-made village at Tarmo, 30 miles (48km) east of Kirkuk innorth-eastern Iraq, where charcoal samples have been dated at 11,200 ±200 yearsand 11,240 ±300 years BP respectively? 57 The village itself is apparently atleast as old as, if not older than those dates. The capacity to build such avillage so soon after the inferred date of the Phaeton disaster was onlypossible if knowledge of organised construction and the requisite skills toeffect it already existed amongst the builders. These must have been catastrophesurvivors, or their immediate offspring, possessing a tradition of buildingtechniques.Larger relics, such as the buried remains of large well-formed boats or ships,probably coeval with at least some of the aforementioned artefacts, haveoccasionally been encountered at various depths in 'drift' deposits. As theseships, which have been discovered in Peru 58 , Switzerland 59 , Russia 60 , andSouth Africa 61 , occur either in solid stone or at remarkable depthsunderground, and are unquestionably of great antiquity, reasonable grounds existfor regarding them as vessels which were probably overwhelmed and buried duringthe Phaeton disaster. Statements like those of the Mandan Indians, who aver thatshortly after the Deluge their forefathers were visited by a mysterious beardedwhite culture-hero who arrived in a huge wooden ship made with 'metal tools' 62, appear as valuable if fragmentary confirmation of prehistoric technologicalabilities.Not improbably, therefore, a great cross-section of antediluvian artefacts anduseful objects lay strewn about the post-diluvian landscape some 11,500 yearsago, often partly buried or obscured by sediments, fallen rock or erupted lava,and no doubt frequently cracked, broken or otherwise damaged. Many, in fact,must have been irretrievably damaged and were unusable. More elaborate objects -even if broken - may still have yielded useful components {eg, cogs, nails, etc)or simply useful flat surfaces or sharp edges which could be salvaged andadapted by those who knew how to do so.Ignorant and semi-ignorant individuals would have remained unaware of thepotential value of such debris, although occasional-ly they may have preserved such items as 'sacred' or 'magical' relics of a lostand much greater past. In this way quite mundane objects may have come to beworn out-landishly as amulets and charms. On the other hand, more knowledgeableindividuals would have been near-ecstatic at finding, say, an intact bowl, aknife, a cut plank of wood or even an isolated brick.In the very earliest post-diluvian days, many human corpses would have beenfound with at least some of their clothing still on them. High latitudesurvivors, facing rapidly cooling climatic conditions, would doubtless have hadno compunction in stripping wearable garments from the dead. Living animals withhides and pelts were rare and, without cutting instruments, difficult to skinand harder still to flense properly, even if successfully parted from theiroriginal owners. Where they occurred, sharp edged stones must have been amongthe very first objects used to cut and pound raw flesh, cut off skins and furs,sever small branches from the multitude of smashed trees and other botanicalrubbish littering the countryside or washed-up as great mats and rafts alongbeaches or choking creeks and backwaters.Flatter stones must have served as the first hammers and mauls, being utilisedto crack open animal bones and drive in stout branches around which the earliestartificial windbreaks must have been constructed. Certainly the salvaging of alltransportable timber must have been an early activity of post-diluvian Man, forthese plants simultaneously afforded fuel (and therefore warmth), buildingmaterials for both permanent and portable refuges, enclosures, mating, fibresand weapons, to name just a few uses.Through necessity, stones - in many places the most common objects on thesurface of the ground - began to be used for all kinds of purposes, and a wholenew culture developed with the use and adaption of stones as the underlyingmotive. Hesitantly at first, and certainly crudely, stones began to be employedas tools, utensils and weapons, with refinements gradually added to the earlieststumbling adaptions. The 'Stone Age' had arrived.A New Beginningc-ajti-jiijsriCatapulted into the unfamiliar, often hostile, Younger Dryas world generated byPhaeton's visit which contrasted so markedly with the previous 'Golden Age', thesurviving remnants of humankind faced what, in effect, was a new beginning. Theprehistoric (Pliocene/Pleistocene) world had gone and a new, historic (Holocene)world had just dawned.Initially, the enforced degradation and vastly depleted population of thesurvivors would combine to retard people's progress for decades, even centuries.Relocation to more favourable localities became an early priority, especiallyfor survivors who at first found themselves in high latitudes. Accordingly,great treks to more benevolent regions were undertaken, the participantslearning en route how effectively to utilise the smallest item to their commonadvantage. The seeds of nomadic lifestyles were born then. People had to adaptor perish.Organised re-peopling and husbandry assumed special urgency then, as did theremarkable civilising activities of the aforementioned mysterious whiteculture-heroes of global tradition. Certainly grassy steppes were among thefirst of the re-vegetated regions occupied by the early survivors. There,pastoral communities developed and bred horses, cattle, sheep and goats, whichwere in time moved systematically from one suitable locality to the next aspastures were eaten down and left to regenerate. A wandering nomadic existencebecame the norm for many survivor groups, and, as Prof Scott-Elliot long agopointed out:...the point... of most importance to us here is the effect of this sort of lifein producing not only breeds of cattle, sheep and goats capable of looking afterthem-selves without much assistance, but also a kind of person of a totally newcharacter. There must have been, as soon as this sort of life became possible,an extraordinary increase in population. Both people and animals would multiplywith extreme rapidity in a practically unlimited ranch such as were the steppesin this early period. The life was healthy enough, though dirty and restless...The mere fact of living in company involves... invaluable discipline... 63In warmer latitudes, where collapsed sky conditions and persistent bitingly coldwinds were either less acute, infrequent or non-existent, re-vegetation of thenew landscape would have proceeded with surprising rapidity, especially inregions extensively covered by freshly deposited muds heavily charged withorganic remains and nutritious mineral and volcanic debris. Seeds, cones, pollenand spores buried in such deposits must have germinated comparatively quickly insuch regions with highly beneficial results. Modern studies of botanicalregeneration in flood-afflicted regions, so intimately governed during YoungerDryas times by often severe climatic fluctuations both north and south of theequator 64 , themselves induced by an unstable, wobbling Earth, strongly supportthe high probability of such developments 65 .Such herbivores as had survived would have naturally gravitated towardsbotanical-ly revitalised areas, and the same would also have been true of manytypes of birds and insects. Reptilian and amphibian survivors, on the otherhand, could have reestablished themselves and multiplied only in warm latitudes.Developments like these in equatorial areas would have been strong inducementsto human survivors aware of them to reach and settle such regions to partake of,and perhaps harvest, the varied life already beginning to proliferate there.This reaction apparently also extended to the settling and exploitation ofequatorial, subtropical and warm-temperate marine and lacustrine coastlines andtheir offshore waters. Numberless early Holocene 'kitchen' middens, containingthe remnants of vast numbers of fish-bones and edible molluscs are known frommany parts of the world, attesting to the attraction such localities andlife-forms had for hard-pressed humanity. In South Africa, for instance, earlyHolocene communities evidently subsisted on shellfish over a very long span oftime 66 , the duration of which can be gauged from the significant changesobservable in the iso-topic record embodied in the mineralogy of shells obtainedfrom different levels within specific middens accumulated then 67 . Essentiallyidentical records have now been traced for the same period almost worldwide.As we have previously noted, environmental changes like this were rathercharacteristic of Younger Dryas times. But of all the changes which took placethen, two in particular were especially critical, and unquestionably influenceda great deal of early Holocene human activity. Apart from the aforementionedhigh winds and thick cloud cover in high latitudes (collapsed sky conditions),ice-caps began to form around earth's relocated poles, as much as a result ofEarth's new axial tilt as of the persistent cloud cover itself. An ice-cap beganto form and expand across what today is Antarctica, with concomitant climaticeffects across much of the southern hemisphere.In warmer latitudes, innumerable glaciers developed in the majority of uplandregions everywhere - even in the tropics 68 - and continued until the onsetbetween seven and eight thousand years ago of warmer conditions. These causedtheir general recession and, in many cases, disappearance. In turn, themelt-waters resulting from this wide-spread diminution of glaciers served to raise world sea levels, with subsequentfurther effect upon climatic regimes. The release of so much additional waterthen also contributed to the natural rearrangement of much of the original'drift' deposits, reducing these in many places to the valley and river-terracesands and gravels of present times.All these developments were further legacies of Phaeton's visit, just as are thepresent day climatic vicissitudes - transient but calamitous local flooding,sudden landslides and the multitude of isolated seismic and volcanicdisturbances. As Wigley 69 and Lamb 70 have so ably pointed out, these and otherenvironmental factors have had a pronounced influence of the development ofHolocene people, their thoughts and industries, so that, in a sense, we arestill combating and experiencing the last-gasp effects of the Phaeton disasteritself, insofar as those affect our home planet, Earth.That the Phaeton disaster proper marked the single most momentous point inintelligent humanity's history so far - the Deluge of global traditionrepresenting our most abiding memory of it - can surely no longer be doubted.Earlier scholars who, using the Deluge as a critical datum, scheduled ancientevents as either ante- or postdiluvian were, despite some of their quaint andoften spurious arguments, essentially correct. To be more accurate, however, weshould perhaps henceforth classify humanity's past history as either pre- orpost-Phaetonic.This is a possibly startling yet eminently defensible proposition, in which thecelebrated Ice Age largely vanishes, and the associated Pleistocene periodshrinks to become an event which, though appallingly violent worldwide, wasactually of surprisingly brief duration. Evidence - much of it of recentdiscovery - repeatedly demonstrating these propositions is not only numerous -itself a most impressive point - but truly interdisciplinary and of a genuinelyglobal scope. Certainly the collective message transmitted by this evidencecannot be justifiably ignored or side-stepped any longer.Yet, despite all the foregoing, the story of the Phaeton disaster remainsunfinished. For obvious reasons the present outline of that event's terriblecharacter and effects is inevitably incomplete and uneven, for much additionalevidence supporting its former reality undoutedly awaits discovery.There can be no question that future research and discoveries will markedlyenhance some of the many aspects still traceable of this remarkable event orwill, with equal incisiveness, modify or even negate others advanced on earlierpages. Nevertheless, the story's main fabric will not fall;the prolific evidence adduced in support of it is too wide-ranging andincontrovertible to permit that.In the light of recorded knowledge, therefore, our presentation of the time whenEarth Nearly Died actually consists of little more than a preliminary study ofan infinitely greater puzzle, en route merely stressing vital links, importanthints, apparently endless ramifications, and suggesting various line of furtherenquiry. The field affected is unquestionably immense, and countless futureresearches will be undertaken before the full extent of this awesome event willbe revealed in all its towering majesty.REFERENCES1.

The location of the poles altered and theArctic region, cut off from the heat of the Sun, was plunged into a prolongednight of devastating cold. Temperatures there dropped almost immediately below-40°C, and perhaps eventually to -71 °C, which is that of the present 'ColdPole' in Siberia. Chronic volcanic pollution of the atmosphere worldwide notonly accompanied this axial shift but also greatly accelerated this tremendous(and permanent) drop in temperature. Large scale watery displacements alsooccurred in these latitudes more or less simultaneously.The intense refrigeration was unquestionably sudden, very sudden. All observershave commented upon this inescapable fact. It froze the ground solid, turnedlake and ground water into great lenses of ice, and froze dead and dying animalsand plants throughout the region into grim memorials which have survived,unchanged, in that condition, down to our own day. Among these have been thefrozen carcasses of mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses and their largecontemporaries.It is the physical state of the flesh of these frozen cadavers which providesevidence of the astonishing suddenness and completeness of this refrigeration.Digby, in his book about Siberian mammoths, quotes Herz as describing mammothflesh as \"...fibrous and marbled with fat\", and as looking \"...as fresh as well-frozen beef\". Excellent soup has been made from the meat of some frozen mammothcarcass, and the meat itself, apparently, was cooked and eaten 2 .This deep refrigeration, therefore, did not seemingly destroy the flesh of theseanimals, even though Merryman and others have contended that sudden, intensefreezing would probably destroy the constituent cells. Merryman cites Lovelockas opining that -5°C is \"...the lowest temperature to which mammalian cells maybe slowly frozen and still survive\" 3 . Others, however, have disputed suchstatements 4 , and it is clear that the evidence of these frozen Siberiancarcasses does too.It is important to note that these mammoth carcasses represent healthywell-nourished individuals. They do not belong to very old, degenerate orstarving animals as some have maintained. Indeed, a deep-frozen six month oldbaby mammoth carcass found in 1977 was so perfectly preserved that analysescould be made of its blood and protein, and its tissues were used for geneticstudies. Interestingly, the date suggested for its demise was about 12,000 yearsBP 5 . This is within the 14,000-9,000 years BP period assigned on the basis ofother C u darings for the general extinction of mammoths in the Arctic\", andrelatively very close to the date of the Phaeton disaster advocated in thisbook.According to professional opinion, to freeze a warm-blooded mammal the size of amammoth requires a temperature of below -30°C to -40°C. This temperature isneeded in order that there is no injury to the cellular tissue, and that thephysio-chemical and enzymic reactions are halted - there is no question of thefreeze being either slow or gradual 7 .Merryman has pointed out that, once the temperature has fallen to a low level,it must remain at that level if a frozen product is toescape serious damage. This is because, if these low levels are not maintained,a recrystallisa-tion process may take place within the ice initially freezingthe product. In such a process numerous small ice crystals combine into largerones, and, in the case of frozen flesh, their growth would disrupt cells andmembranes, allowing the escape of natural juices, nutriment and flavour 8 .Fluctuating freeze-levels would thus damage the flesh and lead eventually todecay and dissolution.From this brief analysis of the mechanics of freezing, we can conclude that thepreservation of mammoth meat for over 11,000 years in virtually unimpairedcondition calls for an initial freeze followed by a great lowering oftemperature which has been maintained uninterrupted throughout the interveningmillennia. The sequence of events comprising the Phaeton disaster - insofar asit directly affected Earth -described in part five requires precisely the set ofeffects epitomised by these Siberian carcasses.It has often been argued that the mammoth, with its thick hairy coat and layerof adipose tissue (established from several of the best preserved frozencadavers) was admirably equipped to withstand the harsh conditions of Ice Agetimes. This theory was tested when a microscopic examination of retrievedmammoth skin was compared with another of the skin of the living Indianelephant. The compar-ison showed that both skins were identical and that neither contained the vitalsebaceous glands for secreting the oil necessary to keep an animal sufficientlywarm under icy conditions. Without a natural supply of oil, the hairy coat ofthe mammoth, and also that of its contemporary the woolly rhinoceros, would havebeen useless in such conditions. On the other hand, a sheep, and in particularthe musk-ox, with its oily coat, is much better equipped than the mammoth or thewoolly rhinoceros to withstand severe cold\".Fat, or adipose tissue, does not necessarily imply a defence mechanism againstcold either. It constitutes a useful food store against winter scarcity orduring months of aridity. As the seeds found in the mouths and stomachs ofvarious frozen mammoths indicate a summer demise 10 , the presence of fat onthese individuals would, in fact, be completely normal. The bison, a companionof the mammoth at many and various localities, is an ecologically-specialisedanimal having a double hump. This feature, like the mammoth's adipose tissue,represents a food store enabling the animal to survive periods of aridity in thegrasslands it inhabits\". Very probably, the woolly rhinoceros was similarlyequipped, because it was not specifically adapted to Arctic tundra vegetation,but, like the bison, preferred rolling grasslands, as demonstrated by theremains which have been found across the plains of Spain 12 .REFERENCES1.

All have limitations,however, as the Argon-Potassium method, outlined below, readily illustrates.Potassium-bearing minerals have often been deposited with accumulated sediments.Potassium (K) is a very active alkaline element including in its composition aradioac-tive isotope which decays at a known rate into two other elements - Argon andCalcium. During this process, an electron from the Potassium 'shell' is capturedby a nucleus, and 12% of the Potassium is converted into Argon-40, and 88% intoCalcium.Calculating the ratio of Potassium to Argon and calcium is quite accurate andeasily applicable for periods extending back several millions of years beforepresent. Unfortunately the half-life is not accurately known and thedistribution of Argon has been found to be inhomogeneous in rocks and minerals.The difficulty is compounded by the fact that no basis presently exists forestimating the isotopic composition of the original Argon, and by theuncertainty surrounding what is taken to be 'original' Argon being, perhaps,actually a recent loss of Potassium 2 .REFERENCES1.

Such an explosion would be of appalling violenceand power, even for a small satellite, and would hurl all large fragments of thedismantled world vast distances in every direction into interplanetary space.Some fragments would hurtle away as single objects, others as groups, and yetothers as great swarms of variously shaped and sized debris, before settlingdown into orbits around the Sun. These orbits would almost certainly beeccentric and lie at all kinds of planes relative to the solar and terrestrialequators, and some might even extend out to the confines of the solar systemitself. In many cases, they would undoubtedly resemble those described in PartFour of the Earth-crossing Apollo asteroids. Orbital eccentricity is a powerfulindication of the geologically very recent origin of these objects.In time many fragments would pass close to Earth or between Earth and itsplanetary neighbours, the largest pieces being, in favourable circumstances,observable from Earth. The celebrated 'law of averages' would ensure that.Following such a disaster, lesser fragments and dust particles would settle downcomparatively quickly into a loose shell of immense size but of slight densityaround the general location of the explosion, and this too would obeygravitational laws and eventually orbit the Sun - in the process graduallybecoming progressively elongated. Such a fate would also befall any unvaporisedportions of the atmosphere and hydrosphere which the destroyed world mayoriginally have possessed, although in the case of surviving liquids and gases,thesewould, in the low temperatures of space, rapidly freeze into various types ofice.If, as we contend, such a catastrophe occurred in the solar system as recentlyas 11,500 years or so ago, then the existence within it of myriads of suchvaried fragments should not only be theoretically possible but actuallyexpected. As shown below, this is precisely what astronomers have apparentlybeen reporting for at least 300 years - although except for a large objectsporadically sighted near Venus during the 17th and 18th centuries, few havebeen observed for any appreciable length of time, and fewer still on more thanone occasion. The problem of what these objects signify has never beensatisfactorily resolved in astronomical literature.From the many now long-forgotten accounts of these transient, anomalous objectswe present a small selection of those which antedated the advent of ballooningand the appearance of man-made satellites, rockets, space vehicles anddisintegrated parts thereof - hence all references derive from before 1900.Meteors are excluded from these notes since their true origins are still underreview, but falls of ice, sometimes of remarkable bulk are included, despitebeing in recent years commonly explained away as ice detached from high-flyingaircraft. Such ice reportedly fell to Earth quite regularly in years predatingthe modern discovery of aviation.Our brief survey proceeds systematically from the Sun outwards as far as Mars.Objects crossing the solar discThree observations were made of dark, unknown bodies passing across the face ofthe Sun on different occasions between February 1762 and May 1764 1 . In 1777,Charles Messier, the French astronomer, saw myriads of black spherical objectscross the solar disc 2 . Similarobjects were seen by Lofft in 1818, and by Stark in 1820 3 ; and again in 1826and 1828 4 . They were seen no less than six times in 1834, twice in 1836, andonce in 1837, when Pastorff watched two objects moving on different coursesacross the Sun's face 5 . Other objects were seen in 1847, 1849\", 1850 7 , 18538 , I860 9 , 1864 10 , 1865\", 1875 and 1876. Hosts of irregularly-shaped blackobjects were seen to cross the Sun in 1883 as if in alignment - similar to theNorth American meteor train of 1913' 2 .Some of these objects were either very large or were comparatively close to theterrestrial observers, for one, apparently one-fifth of the diameter of the Sun,was sighted with the naked eye between 1st and 5th May 1764 by Hoffman, who sawit slowly traverse the solar disc from north to south, an almost unheard-ofdirection of motion: but not for an object following a highly eccentric orbit.An almost equally large (or near) object was sighted by Lichtenberg in November1762. It took approximately three hours to cross the Sun's face. Objects aslarge as these would, if they penetrated the solar system, undoubtedly causeplanetary disturbances. These did not, so the conclusion must be that theobjects were really quite close to Earth when observed. Indeed, at 800 miles(1280km) distance, such objects would need to be only about one mile (1.6km) indiameter to appear that large or take that amount of time to transit the solardisc. Obviously the further away the objects were from Earth the larger theymust actually have been. What, however, was their origin and why did they followsuch unusual orbits?Objects near MercuryIn 1799, the astronomers Harding and Schroed-ter independently reported seeing aluminous body of unknown identity crossing the face of Mercury, and on May 22nd1854 three unknown objects of varying sizes were sighted in space apparentlyclose to Mercury, and have not been seen since 13 . Points of light wereobserved crossing the unillurninated parts of Mercury 14 and Venus\" on severaloccasions in 1892 16 .named Neith. As early as 1645 a moon-sized object was sighted near Venus, andwas reportedly seen four times during the first half of the eighteenth century,and again in 1867. Denning in 1871 and Hind in 1873 both saw a rather similarobject, while in April 1876, at Berlin, Weber watched a black body pass acrossthe illuminated part of the Venusian globe. Seven more sightings of 'Neith' weremade in 1886, although whatever it was has not been observed since.Objects near to or crossing the lunar discThere have been numerous sightings of dark bodies traversing the face of theMoon 17 . In the 19th century, a dark triangular-shaped object was observed forthree minutes, which obliterated almost a quarter of the Moon's face 18 . In1917, Dr Harris saw a large object silhouetted against the Moon which heestimated to be about 250 miles (400km) long and 50 miles (80km) wide 19 . Othermaverick travellers through solar space appear to reflect the Sun's light, thealbedo being due to their composition - probably of ice or frozen gas. Brightlights have been seen against the Moon over the last 200 years. They were seenin 1783 20 and 1787 2 ' and again in 1821 22 . Prof Harrison saw a bright pointof light \"...resembling a reflection from a moving mirror\" in 1877 23 , while asimilar object was seen in 1881. Even in more modern times such observationshave occurred, such as in 1910 24 and 1917. These instances are but a smallfraction of the recorded reports of similar sightings of objects close to theMoon.Objects on or close to MarsIn 1864 and 1865, small shining reddish lights were noticed on the Martian disc25 , while a light-reflecting body was seen in space above the unilluminatedportion of Mars in 1894 26 . It was not Phobos or Deimos. In the twentiethcentury, a \"...fountain of flashing light\" was seen on the face of Mars by ProfPickering for 70 minutes in 1900, while on more than one occasion severalbrilliant moving spots of light crossed the Martian disc in 1911.Objects near VenusEarly modern astronomers considered that Venus possessed a large satellite whichtheyObjects in the vicinity of EarthUnexplained phenomena have been noticed closer to our own planet. Henry Waldnersaw aAppendix C 351large number of small shining bodies pass at great altitude from East to West in1863. This group of objects had been seen previously crossing the sky aboveNaples in 1845. The objects were of diverse shape, and it was concluded theywere made of ice 27 . In 1849, Sir Robert Inglis watched thousands of brilliantwhite objects cross a cloudless sky for 25 minutes 28 . A similar phenomenon waswatched by Rev W Read for no less than six hours in 1851 2 \"; a repeatperformance occurred in 1860, which was described as having \"...shone with aremarkably brilliant light\" 1 \".The brilliance of these unknown objects suggests that they were either burningmeteors, or were pieces of ice illuminated by sunlight as they passed close tothe Earth's upper atmosphere. In 1882, Prof Schwedoff argued that ice ofcelestial origin existed and accounted for the bombardment of the Earth bycurious hailstones and huge chunks of ice which occur from time to time 31 .ImpactSooner or later the law of averages will ensure that collisions will take placebetween these maverick objects and the planets or their satellites. One,involving the Moon, apparently occurred on June 25th., 1178 A.D., according toGervase of Canterbury. On that day 5 men of Kent allegedly watched fast-movingclouds and flames issue from a point within the unlit area between the horns ofthe new Moon, the illuminated part turning dusky and remaining so for severaldays 32 .Astronomers Clube and Napier 33 ascribe this duskiness to clouds of lunarsurface dust being temporarily cast skywards by the impact's severity and shockwaves. The suspension of such dust, even for a few hours, necessitates anatmosphere, something many texts deny the Moon possesses 34 , although that wasnot the view of several earlier observers 35 . More recently, however, Moore hascategorically stated that a lunar atmosphere does exist, albeit veryatten-uatedly 36 .ObscurationsOccasionally observations have been made of temporary disappearnces ordiminutions, by generally invisible phenomena, of the normalluminosity of familiar celestial objects. Just a few examples must suffice here.On the clear nights of January 16th., and 24th., and of February 17th., 1898, adiffuse 'cloud-like' object, far beyond Earth's upper atmosphere, discolouredand dimmed many stars in the constellation of Perseus' 7, M . Ancient Babyloniancuneiform texts list earlier (undated) analogous effects. These included Cancerbecoming \"dark\" and Venus as having once acquired a \"dark crown\" 39 . We maytake these statements to mean that, on different occasions, the constellation ofCancer was temporarily obscured and Venus partially so.Early Chinese annals contain essentially similar records. Although a summer'snight in 687 B.C. was evidently clear, the 'fixed stars failed to appear\", but\"in the middle of the night stars fell like rain\"*'. Here, celestial opacity andan apparent meteor shower (stars falling like rain) were, inferentially,separate phases of a single event.While all the foregoing obscurations were temporary affairs, others are knownwhere the disappearances have been of far longer, even permanent, duration.Examples include the second magnitude stars listed by Johann Bayer in 1603 41 as3 and y in the stern and yard of the constellation Argo (The Ship). These wereno longer visible by April 1668 42 . Other stars recorded in Tycho Brahe'sfamous stellar catalogue of 1602 as visible in Ursa Minor (the Lesser Bear) andAndromeda had either vanished or markedly dimmed by 1664 when Giovanni Cassinisearched for them. By 1671 another had disappeared in Pisces (The Fishes) and 8years later, when Edmund Halley published his star catalogue, still others haddimmed 44 .That these were not fading novae or super-novae seems clear for, throughout thesame general period, other formerly unknown stars of considerable brilliancebecame (and have ever since remained) visible in the constellations ofCassiopeia, Erkianus, and Andromeda, as well as near the celestial North Pole.One or more far distant clouds of otherwise invisible matter variously obscured,dimmed, or 'revealed' so-called 'fixed stars' as they drifted across regionsbetween those luminaries and Earthbound observers 45 .Even though it is known that vast and often dense clouds of dust and gas occupynumerous cosmic regions 46 , not improbably most if not all of the abovephenomena results from the presence and movements of the circumsolar dust-ringrecently discovered interacting with Earth's orbital path, discussed more fullybelow.Lunar OdditiesEven such a large and cyclically bright body as the Moon apparently sometimesvanishes, or, on other occasions, has been associated with celestial phenomenaaccorded scant (if any) attention in standard astronomical manuals. Thephenomena, however, are particularly germane to the subject before us.Disappearances are reviewed first.During the total lunar eclipse of May 18th, 1761, the Moon vanished completelyfor upwards of half an hour. Even during a total eclipse, sufficient lightnormally remains for successful telescopic observation of the principle lunarsurface features; but not on May 18th., 1761. Otherwise undetectable matterbetween Earth and Moon had blotted out the latter.As noticed from places as far apart as London, Ipswich, and Dresden, the Moonfailed to appear in seemingly clear skies on June 10th and 11th, 1816 47 48 .Millennia earlier, Babylonians had witnessed the same thing three times in asingle month 49 .Although some, perpetuating a commonly invoked explanation, have identified thecausal obscuring agent during such events 5 \" as dense volcanic dust ejectedduring eruptions into Earth's atmosphere, other interpretations, as indicatedbelow, are now available to us.Like the unaccountably hazy illumination of the eastern part of the Moon's darklimb at 10.00pm on March 24th, 1882 51 , and the glow which - too bright forEarth-shine - covered the Moon's unlit portion two years later 52 , a 1,500miles long shadow (not cast by the Earth), seen during daytime inspection of thelunar disc by Australian observers Hirst and Russell in 1878, was hardly causedby sunlight reflected from, or a shadow cast by, meteor swarms moving between ornear Earth and the Moon 53 . Such swarms are singularly non-reflective.A professional report from Santiago, Chile, details a total eclipse of the Sunon November 30th, 1893. Briefly, 12 or 15 minutes before the eclipse began, thespace separating the Moon's limb and the brilliant solar limb wasinstantaneously covered by moving nebulous matter of a dark rosy hue. As thisprogressively covered the Sun's face, it darkened as though \"compressed\".Eventually, neither the solar or lunar limbs could be properly distinguishedthrough it. Almost as soon as this obscuring matter passed out of sight, asmaller unknown dark object for an instant covered the Moon to cause a splendidannular eclipse 54 .This account indicates that a solid dark body, preceded by a transparent masspassed between the Earth and Moon on the date in question. Yet, under normalconditions neither was visible from Earth.Numerous reports exist of unfocusable nebulosities, either on or high above thelunar landscape. Variously described as pale or milky white, misty or diffuse,these nebulosities often move, drift, alter shape, or disappear. Occasionallydark bodies, that cast no shadows upon the Moon's surface, have been reportedtemporarily obscuring lunar topographical features. Such 'shadowless' objectsmust be located far outside the satellite's atmosphere, in space nearer, thoughstill distant from, Earth.A comparable nebulous object, briefly noted on the Sun's disc during May 26th,1828, but not sighted since 55 , must have been positioned that day in spacesomewhere between Earth and the Sun. It almost certainly falls into the samecategory as the aforecited Martian and lunar nebulosities.Anomalous Meteorological PhenomenaFrom time to time Earth experiences singular falls of ice, stones (notmeteoritic), mud and strange snows. On balance these do not readily conform tothe known workings of terrestrial meteorology and show every sign of havingnon-terrestrial origins. Their very nature and common celestial origin suggeststhat they form part of the lesser residue of one or more disintegrated formerworlds. Again, only a small number of the total recorded instances can be givenhere.Appendix C 353Falls of iceIn May 1802, a mass of ice 3ft long, as many wide, and over 2ft thick fell inHungary. Pieces of ice, a foot in circumference, fell in Derbyshire, England, inMay 1811, and in 1828 a lump about a cubic yard in size fell at Candeishe inIndia. A block of ice weighing Hlbs fell at Cette, France, in 1844; while a hugemass, some 20ft in circumference, fell at Ord in Scotland during 1849. Another,of comparable dimensions, fell in August of the same year at Bulvullich, also inScotland. Pumpkin-sized pieces of ice fell on Gunfalore in India in 1851; and inMarch 1860, during a snowstorm, giant lumps of ice fell so thickly on hillsidesin Upper Wasdale, England, that from a distance they resembled flocks of sheep.An 801b block of ice fell during August 1882 near Salina, Kansas, while fiveyears later 'snowflakes' 15in across and 8in thick fell prodigiously in Montana.In November 1901, innumerable pieces of ice each weighing a minimum of lib fellin Victoria, Australia. Very significantly, many reports (which collectivelyembrace practically the entire world) specifically note that, upon inspection,pieces of fallen ice give the appearance of being fragments ofrecently-disintegrated larger sheets or blocks.Recent analysis of NASA images of large icy bodies entering and melting throughfriction in Earth's upper atmosphere, not only contribute to our planet's watersupply, but indicate -through weighing as much as 20 tonnes each -the source ofthe fallen ice blocks from space mentioned by Prof. Schwedoff.Showers of StonesSo many little stones fell during a violent storm at Wolverhampton, England, inJune 1860, that they were cleared away with shovels 56 . Great numbers of smallblack stones fell at Birmingham during a storm in August 1858, and a largequantity of water-worn pebbles, unlike any known from the district, fell inPalestine, Texas in July 1888 57 . Similarly, numerous smooth pebbles fell atKandahar in Afghanistan in 1834, while in May 1884 two falls of flinty stonesoccurred at Bismarck, North Dakota, each separated by an interval of 15 hours'*.Interestingly, some of the many stones which rained down upon Dhurmsalla,India, in 1860 were coated with ice - Dhurmsalla is located in one of thewarmest parts of India. It must be obvious that all these falls, and many othersomitted here, were of non-mete-oriric stones. Nor will it escape notice that,like the falls of ice, they occur globally.Rains of Mud and DustDuring November 1902 staggering quantities of dust and mud fell over Australia,and fell there again in 1903 - 50 tons of it per square mile. It also fell instupendous quantities simultaneously over much of Europe and western Russia, andwas reported as having also fallen then over the Canary Islands, and by shipshalf-way between Britain and Barbados in the Caribbean. No less than 10 milliontonnes of it is said to have fallen on southern England alone 59 . At the timeit was fatuously alleged to be dust and sand whirled up from the Sahara Desert,an explanation still commonly advanced to account for modern falls of similarred dust and mud. Did Earth pass in 1902 and 1903 through part of the greatcloud or shell of particles which, as previously argued, formed after theexplosive disintegration of one or more once-solid bodies over 11,500 years ago?And what, we may also ask, was the origin of the thick shower of marble-sizedballs of soft, pulpy matter, which crumbled when dry, which fell at Queenstown,South Africa, in lSSS? 60 . It was hardly a volcanic product, although somemight reason that the following probably was, when on June 7th 1846 a'slag'-like matter fell at Darmstadt, Germany.CorrelationMore or less coincidentally with the first printing of this book, astronomersannounced the discovery just outside Earth's present orbit of a circumsolar ringof 'asteroidal' dust in 'resonant lock' with our planet 1 '. The plane of thering's orbit differs from that of Earth's, whereby the two intersect erraticallyand partially at that.In reality the ring consists not only of genuine dust particles, ranging fromsubmicron (mud) sized grains to larger (sand or grit) sized material, but alsoof a vast assortment of stones and boulders. The volume and range of thismaterial is distributed unevenly and discontin-uously along the ring's orbitalpath, andincludes both clouds and trains of assorted meteoritic matter.To a large degree the ring seems to be a likely source of much of the 10,000tons of extraterrestrial dust thought to fall to Earth annually, and, probably,of a high percentage of the countless meteorites (not meteors) which also arriveevery year. It is also known that inter-planetary dust grains, when congregatedinto dense clouds, have a tendency to develop ice-mantles 62 , the whole cloudbecoming opaque and of low reflectivity. Indeed, such clouds are onlyilluminated by received star (sun) light 63 .Here then, we contend, is an identifiable source of most if not all of theanomalous celestial phenomena just surveyed, why it is monitorable onlyirregularly, why observations of it extend both outwards towards Mars andinwards towards Venus and the Sun, and why certain \"falls\" or othermanifestations of it are sporadic and occasionally repeated in quick orcomparatively quick sequences. Intermittent 'clipping' or 'grazing' of the tworelevant orbits would go far towards explaining the unusual patterns traced inprevious paragraphs. Furthermore, the so-called 'invisibility' of much of theaforementioned obscuring matter, due to its presumed non-reflectivity, and thediffuse or luminous character of various other bodies detailed earlier(presumably ice-coated and therefore capable of reflecting sunlight, or evenEarth-shine) now becomes explicable.This dust ring plainly represents the dispersed residue of a body which hasdistinte-grated. Its position indicates that the disintegration occurred in thegeneral vicinity of the Earth-Moon system. As postulated in Part Five a majorfeature of the Phaeton visitation was the cataclysmic destruction, close toEarth, of a satellitic body remembered anciently as Kingu, large fragments ofwhich apparently fell to Earth as 'burning mountains', the Wormwood Star, andrains of 'iron' hailstones. Since, however, the disintegration was explosive,dispersal of the affected material was radial, whereby a high percentage of theresultant debris was flung away from Earth. The dust ring now represents theorbital path onto which a great deal of this material has now settled, albeitsomewhat discontinuously and in variable amounts at different places along itsroute. Was this antiquity's 'Hammered Bracelet' (see p.224 supra).Thus, many if not all of the curious observations just detailed concern furtherremnants of the terrible calamity endured by Earth approximately 11,500 yearsago - remnants still in free but decidedly wayward orbits. That they, and thedust ring, actually exist so close to the Earth-Moon system is also positiveconfirmation of the general validity of the scenario presented in this study.Had they not existed the presentation would have been flawed.REFERENCES1.

Op cit, pl05.Appendix DPhaeton's Source?f-^Zj&riij^zr*Recent studies of the Vela supernova, theorised as Phaeton's likely source onpages 209-210 supra, demonstrate that its remnants - a radio and X-ray shellover 60 parsecs in diameter - comprise a tiny neutron star or pulsar (PRS0833-45) 1 closely associated with the filamentary 'nebula' Stromlo 16 2 , andthat its radially expanded ejecta now occupy an impressive 4 to 5 degree ofastronomical space 3 .A pulsar is a naturally pulsating radio star. A parsec is an astronomical unitof distance equivalent to slightly more than 3'A light years 4 . Light travelsat a prodigious 18,284 miles per second, or 11 million miles per minute, andtherefore about 6 million million miles per year 5 . This last figure representsthe distance involved in a single 'light'-year or parsec. Although to us suchspeeds and distances are virtually unimaginable, the are neverthelessauthenticated facts.Similarly, more distant filamentous 'nebulae', such as the Loop (NGC 6960) andVeil (NGC 6992-6995) examples in the constellation Cygnus, and the famous Crab'nebula' (M.l) in Taurus 6 , which exploded in A.D. 1054, constitute thescattered residue of other supernovae. Lethal masses of atomic hydrogencharacterise one of the Cygnus shells 7 , while the wisps and knot-likeconcentrations of disrupted astral matter in the Crab 'nebula' possess hugemagnetic fields and emit intense electromagnetic radiation 8 . They are alsoknown to be moving by as much as '/wth of the speed of light\".Indeed, supernovae fragments can be expelled at speeds at least in the order of10 4 km.S _1 10Analysis of all relevant data indicates that the average total mass ejectedduring supernovae detonations is equivalent to 1.4 solar masses 11 , and, asthey hurtle through interstellar space 12 , retain their compact shapes over a10 4 years period 13 , provided they avoid resistant or perturbing phenomena.Relative to these factors, there is certainly no reason to suppose that the Velaparoxysm and resultant fragments differed significantly from this supernovanorm.Thus, even if travelling at only '/wth the speed of light, supernovae ejectavelocities are still staggeringly great and ensure the traversal of vast tractsof interstellar space in comparatively short periods of time. Such enormousspeeds would also tend dramatically to jeopardise the natural rotational andorbital speeds of lesser bodies encountered en route, not to mention theirphysical structures.As far as is known, no comet, bolide, or asteroid possesses magnetic fields,emits electromagnetic radiation, or travels at the vertiginous speeds ofsupernovae ejecta. Yet, all surviving descriptions of Phaeton and its reportedbehaviour indicate that these corresponded closely to those of a highlydangerous, but thankfully small, supernova fragment initially catapultedsupersonically towards, and eventually into, the Solar System from the fardistant region now occupied by the Vela pulsar.REFERENCES1.

IAUColloq, 101 (Cambridge)Appendix EThe Seven Suns«\"V^**'S>$*»^'~»Seven spherical dots, globes, or 'stars' repeatedly feature on ancientMesopotamian artefacts (eg Fig 4.11d on p216 supra), as well as other relicsfrom as far distant as Canaan 1 , Hittite Syria 2 , Cyprus 3 , Persia 4 , andpre-Columbian Peru 5 . They were obviously of great significance to the peopleswho portrayed them. Always believed to have possessed 'astral' connotations,they appear in Near Eastern art as early as 'archaic' times h .Although invariably seven, their mode of presentation varies widely. Thus theyappear as straight lines , as triangles '%•', as clusters .:::, ::•, :::*, •::;,or .%•••., as rosettes •«, unified along a stem •:, or as irregularscatter-patterns.«..«. Of these, the cluster and rosette arrangements are metwith the most often.They frequently occur peripheral to, or as integral elements in, depictions ofmythological scenes - most commonly of great battles between heroic 'dieties'(Marduk/Phaetori), and a serpentine or winged 'dragon-monster' {Tiamat) 7 . Thiswas evidently a very popular subject among the ancients. At least one instanceis known showing the dots in cluster form adjacent to apparent widespreadcelestial derangement 8 .When shown as rosettes, they appear as six small globes equidistant round alarger central dot ('sun') 9 . Although several such examples feature in'peaceful' scenes 10 , others occur in association with a horned serpent or'dragon' 11 .Frequently depicted as seven-headed 12 , and as flaming or fiery 13 , thisserpent was anciently equated with the many-headed Hydra of classical mythology14 . As a traditional emblem, it long predated even those accounts and was,earlier still, regularly identified with the 'dragons' of Tiamat 15 . Someaccounts even identify Tiamat as the'dragon', adding that it, too, was many-headed 16 .Interestingly, Revelation (12.3ff) records the Hebrew Leviathan, describedelsewhere as a \"crooked serpent\" (Psalms, 74.14), as a seven-headed sea-monster17 . Canaanite lore calls the same entity Yamm >g or Mot w , while Sumerianrecords refer to it as Kur. The latter add that it was eventually shattered intoinnumerable pieces 20 .Van Buren, admitting that the identification of the 7-dot emblem was \"verydifficult\", noted that some thought it represented the Pleiades, the sevendeified sage sons of Enmesarra, or the divine symbol of Sibitti 21 . Hayes Ward,while suggesting that the latter probably equated with the Igigi, also wonderedif the emblem might represent Nergal, the ancient Mesopotamian 'god' of thePleiades 22 .It is undoubtedly significant that the dates of certain religious festivals inIndia, Egypt, Australia, and Peru were determined from the annual Autumnalrising of the Pleiades star-group 23 . Interestingly, a still little-understoodpre-Columbian script from Peru, featuring this same seven dot emblem, shows italongside 11 dots (shades of Fig. 4. lid) separated into adjoining groups of 5and 6 dots by a serpentine figure, which may reasonably be interpreted as theabovementioned Hydralike 'dragon' 24 .In that connection it is surely relevant that several ancient cylinder-sealsdepicting the Marduk (Phaeton)/Tiamat fight also show adjacent artistic devicesfeaturing 11 elements. Examples include 11 small globes from Nineveh 25 , 11'petals' round a disc or sphere crowning a 'Tree-of-Life' symbol from Kish 2b ,one from Cyprus showing an 11-rayed 'Sun' 27 , and another from Assyriadepicting a 'deity' holding a circle composed of 11 small touching globes 28 .We hardly need to remind ourselves that the Deluge catastrophe, associated withthe cosmic arrival of seven 'suns' or 'burning mountains', was widely rememberedas a September (Autumnal) event in the northern hemisphere (see pp.161 and 173supra).Did the Pleiades star-group, then, act among early peoples as a celestial markerforthe time of the loss of a pre-Phaetonic 'Golden Age', or as that denoting whenthe dawn of a new one (the Holocene) began? Do not these curious sets of 7 and11 dots confirm the broad validity of the Mesopotamian connection traced in PartFour, and are they not further un-expected but welcome aspects of the dramaticscenario unfolding before us?REFERENCES1.

Op cit, p201, fig 577.Appendix FNotesr^i^**-t>fefejar»The following notes, designed to augment specific themes, are given hereseparatelyto avoid undue interruption of the main narrative. The relevant text page shownin bold.1. John Harris (1876. Celestial Sphere and the Doctrine of the Earth'sPerpendicular Axis (Montreal), 42pp.) also discussed this celestial change,which apparently affected the original location of the 4 cardinal points.Persian records state that in remotely early times these were marked in theheavens by 4 'zodiacal' stars - those, representing the two equinoxes, being theEye of the Bull (Taurus) and the Heart of the Scorpion (Scorpio) and those thesolstices the Head of the Lion (Leo) and the Southern Fish (Pisces) (BaiUy, J S1787. Traite de I'Astronomic Indienne et Orientate (Paris), clxxx + 427pp; vpl3). These stars no longer coincide with today's cardinal points. Also relevantare the remarks of Dupuis, Maurice and other early writers that, as the zodiacalconstellation of Libra shows indications of formerly being a Spring equinoctialsign and Aries an Autumnal one, the precession of the equinoxes has, since theinvention of the zodiac either moved progressively, or by some sudden jolt,forwards by 7 zodiacal signs.See ppl91 and 197 supra for other important zodiacal or allied changes, (p. 15)2. Other factors were also involved. For example, long and deep fiords (reviewedagain on p35 supra), are often regarded as glacial (ice-sculpted) features. Muchtime believedly elapsed while slow-acting ice allegedly excavated them. Theduration of the Pleistoceue epoch was accordingly extended to accommodate such aprocess, (p. 25)3. Pacific territories submerged geologically recently include those onceunifying Australia and New Guinea, and the latter with Melanesia and Micronesiaas far North as the Caroline Islands (Van Andel, T H, G R Heath, T C Moore, andD R F McGeary. 1961. \"Late Quaternary History, Climate and Oceanography of theTimor Sea, Northwestern Australia\", Amer ] Sci, vol 265, pp737-758; Krausse, D S1965. \"Submarine Geology North of New Guinea\", Bull Geol Soc Amer, vol 76,pp27-42; Bloom, A. 1969. \"Holocene submergence in Micronesia as the standard forEustatic sea-level changes\", Quaternaria (Paris), vol xii (1970). (p. 90)4. Natural effects inferable from a supposed near or actual collision betweenEarth and a large cosmic object include atmospheric ignition, when firewould fill the \"whole space between sky and Earth\" (Zahule, K ] 1990.\"Atmospheric Chemistry by large Impacts\", Spec Papers Geol Soc Amer, vol 247,pp271-288; see p282).This effect, discussed as early as 1931 (Walk, L. 1931. \"DasFlut-geschwisterpaar als Ur- und Stammelternpaar der Menschheit\". Mitt. Osterr.Ges. Anthrop. Ethnol. Prahist, vol 78-79, pp60-115), is best expressed asivildfire. Ovid's account was thus no exaggeration, (p. 152)5. As given below, Aldi's earlier translation of the same passage containsdifferences, as seen later (see p295 supra), of some significance.\"A comet of a most terrible aspect, wreathed in spiral volumes, and resembling aknot, or cluster of fire, in the most early periods of the world, appeared inEgypt and Aethiopia, which . . . the king then reigning in Egypt denominatedTyphon: and because Plutarch affirms that the ocean was called Typhon, anargument has been deduced from thence, that this comet was the occasion of thedeluge.\" (Pliny: Nat. Hist., Lib. 2, cap. 25, pl4 - Aldi ed, 1559)Compare the 'spiral wreathing' of this account with the \"swirling as awhirlwind\" of the Babylonian epic (see p.222 supra). The concept of Phaetonbeing a twisting or spiralling object obviously far antedated Roman times, (p.152)Up to the time of Seneca comets had, on the authority of Aristotle and otherclassical philosophers, been regarded simply as \"sublunary vapours floating inthe aether\". Seneca, the first to study comets as true cosmic objects, did notconsider Typhon as a star or a normal celestial body but as something different.Like Pliny, he described it as a great knot of fire. (Halley, E. \"Synopsis\" atend of \"Elements of Physical and Geometrical Astronomy\" in Halley's Oxfordlectures edited by J. Kersey (Oxford), 1717).6. Earth presently rotates West to East. Modern studies of Phaeton's apparentflightpath suggest it ran, con-trarily, southeast to northwest (Tollmann, A andE Tollmann. 1993. Und die Sintflut gab es dock (Miinchen), 560pp; v 210) -interestingly the predominant direction of the aforementioned glacial striae(see p9 supra), (p. 154)7. That dry land recently occupied extensive areas now below Pacific waters (seeNote 3) tends to counterbalance such doubts, (p. 156)8. Some North American accounts state that this protracted 'night' fell soswiftly that the Flood, arising soon afterwards, poured across the land amidintense gloom (Boehmer, J. 1932. \"Telliirische Trummerstucke im Fluthericht derGenesis\", Zeit. fur Alttestamental. Wiss., vol 50, ppll7-124). (p. 159)9. Inevitably the semi-permanent darkness, largely created by chronicatmospheric pollution itself induced by widespread volcanism (but also see dataon the 'dust ring' given in Appendix C), led to radically reduced temperaturesand the onset of cold conditions. As several traditions record, the magneticstorms naturally generated by this pollution quickly engendered excessive andpersistent rainfall. Some accounts describe this as hot or boiling (Liicken, H.1956 Die Traditionen des Menschen-geschichte order die Uroffenbarung Gottesunter den Heiden (Miinster), 483pp; v. pl85), a phenomenon more recentlyexplained by the aerodynamicist S K Croft (\"First-Order Estmates of ShockHeating and Vaporisation in Oceanic Impacts\", Spec Papers Geol SocAmer, vol 190(1982), ppl43-152; v pl50). (p. 160)10. The low temperatures at numerous places ensured early conversion of rainsinto snow and ice. Effects varied locally. German accounts record the resultantsnowfalls lasting for three whole years (Derolez, R L M 1976. Gotter und Mythender Germanen (Weisbaden), 334pp; v p286), while in Iran the bleak conditionspermitted no more than two months of 'summer' for several decades (Rhode, ] G1819. Ueber den Aufimg unserer Geschichie und die leizie Revolution der Erde alswahrscheinliche Wirkung eines Kometen (Breslau), 78pp; v p21). (p. 161)11. Several Deluge traditions independently confirm this conclusion. In thenorthern hemisphere, for example, both the Babylonian historian Berosus(Stentzel, A. 1894. Weltschopfung Sintfluth und Goll (Braunschweig), 183pp; vppl37f) and the Canadian Chippeywayan Indians (Andree, R. 1891. Die Flutsagen,ethnographisch betrachtet (Braunschweig), 152pp; z> p82) date the Deluge as aSeptember event. Appropriately, the Yamana Indians of Tierra del Fuego in thesouthern hemisphere remember it as a Springtime occurrence (Tollmann, A., and E.Tollmann. 1993. Op cit, p211). As noted on pl61 supra, Autumn in one hemisphere,is Spring in the other, (p. 173)12. A literal turning over of the Earth, while difficult to conceivemechanically, might well explain those early beliefs, repeatedly discussed sinceclassical times through George Costard (A Further Account of the Rise andProgress of Astronomy among the Ancients (London: 1748), 163pp; v p8) toImmanuel Velikovsky (Worlds in Collision (London: 1950),384pp; see pp83, 112-130), which insisted that the stars have changed theircourses 4 times and the Sun has twice set in the East since the creation of Man.(p. 191)13. The oldest Chaldean solar zodiacs, which date from 5,000 or more years ago,show only 11 signs, the space now occupied by Libra (The Scales) being taken upby Scorpio's claws (Costard, G. 1748. Op cit p 10). The ancients preserved thetraditional connections between these constellations when they referred to themas Chelae Scorpionis (Maurice, T. 1820. Histon/ of Hindustan, 2nd ed, 2 vols,(London); seevoll,pp291,298).The dynastic Egyptians regarded the Scorpion (Scorpio) as the mortal enemy oftheir god Osiris, who was avenged by his son Horus (Graves, R. 1960. The GreekMyths, rev edn, 2 vols, (London); see vol 1, pi 53: Mackenzie, D A c 1918. Mythsof Crete and pre-Hellenic Europe, (London), liv + 361pp; see pxxx), and knew itas Typhon (see pl52 supra). Similarly, classical Greek lore makes the Scorpionthe adversary of the heroic hunter Orion, the archer-god Apollo fulfillingHorus's avenging role. Constellationally, the first stars of Scorpio riseannually as the last of Orion set, in direct allusion to this astronomicalmythology.Intimations also exist that the earlier Sumerians and Babylonians knew Orion asGi/gaffics/i-the-hunter (Graves, R. 1960. Ibid: Sandars, N K 1972. The Epic ofGilgamesh, rev edn, (London), 128pp; see p21), and that both were at leastpartly identical with antiquity's foremost hero Hercules (Herakles) (Graves, R.1960. Op cit, vol 1, pl53, vol 2, pl42). In Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" (Lib 1, p438)Apollo vanquishes the monstrous Python (Typhon) at the time of Deucalion's Flood(see ppl52-153 supra) with special arrows, thereby partially paralleling theequivalent account in the Norse Eddas. As seen in Appendix E, Typhon (Phaeton)was often equated with the multi-headed Hydra, traditionally slain by Hercules.Germane, then, are the many ancient Mesopotamian cylinder seals depicting such acreature battling one or more arrow-shooting figures, the chief of whom isfrequently identified as Marduk (Hayes Ward, W. 1910. Seal Cylinders of WesternAsia, Carnegie Inst., Publ. 100, xxxi + 428pp.; see figs 187b, 563-580,584-585). As well as being another link in the 'Mesopotamian Connection', it isalso surely significant that the zodiacal sign next to Scorpio isSagittarius-the Archer!Libra was thus not an original zodiacal sign, but added only after Phaeton'svisit, when the new (post-diluvian) celestial order was determined. (p. 197)14. Recent observations of the speed of a post-explosion X-ray jet from the Velasupernova indicate that it is as high as 540km.S\"' (Markwardt, C B, and HOgel-man. 1995. \"An X-Ray jet from the Vela pulsar\", Nature, vol 375, no: 6526,pp40-41) and that the original explosion possibly occurred a little earlier thanAppendix F 361first calculated (Lyne, AG, RS Pritchard, F Graham-Smith, and F Camilo. 1996,\"Very Low Breaking Index for the Vela pulsar\", Nature, vol 381, no: 6582,pp497-498). Either way such data is consistent with the scenario advanced here.(p. 210)15. That it was given a tail described as stretching \"far along the zodiac\"(Rhode, J G 1819. Op cit, pl9) localises Tristrya's course as watched fromEarth. Significantly, when traversing the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, it was,under one of its Mesopotamian titles, Zalbatanu, described as the \"star thatabounds in death\" (Langdon, S. 1935. Babylonian Menologies and their . SemiticCalendars, Schweich Lectures, Brit Acad Lond, vi + 169pp; see p8). Although nowgreatly fragmented, memories of this calamitous object are strikinglyconsistent, (p. 211)16. Several accounts from India mention the approach of many \"terrible suns\"(Hochenberger, A. 1930. Die Indische Flutsage und das Matsayapurana, (Leipzig),217pp; v 21); the Hebrew 'Henoch' refers to seven invading 'stars', eachresembling a \"burning mountain\" (Roloff, J 1984. Die Ofenbarung Johannes:Ziircher Bibelkommentare, N. T, 18 TJieol Ver, Zurich, 218pp; v 99); andPeruvian traditions occur that speak of six 'suns' which, assaulting Earth,caused the Deluge (Lenormant, F. 1889. Les Origines de I'Histoire, 5 vols(Paris); see vol 5, ppl6-17). (also see pl2 supra), (p. 212)17. This was doubtless a result of the raging 'wildfire' engendered by the'atmospheric ignition' mentioned in Note 4. Such effects should also beconsidered in conjunction with those of the 'Firestorm' detailed on pp269-276supra, (p. 262)18. Babylonian records refer to the rains of mud and 'grains' (sand) which fellduring the evening before the arrival of the Wormwood Star and the hurningmountain' (Schott, A 1984. \"Das Gilgamesch Epos\", ed by W von Soden. ReclamUniversal Bibliothek 7235/2,127pp; see p96). (p. 290)19. Strangely enough, this remarkable scenario is actually recorded on earlySumerian clay tablets: there, Marduk/Phaeton is called Kur - \"a monstrous dragonwhich held Tehom's (Earth's) waters in check\" (Kramer, S H 1056. From theTablets of Sumer (Indian Hills, Colorado), xxvi + 293pp; see pl95).What early people, even a race as comparatively advanced as the Sumerians, couldhave imagined an event as aberrant as this had it not really taken place? (p.302)20. The Meskito Indians of Nicaragua preserve similar memories of the Floodwhich, they aver, was brought by a tremendous hurricane as a giant wave, so highthat it submerged and swept away all things (Scrope Viner, H. W. 1928.\"Primitive Beliefs of Nicaraguan Indians\", Folklore, vol 39, ppl66-171; vppl66-7). (p. 304)21. It would be reasonable to suppose that the transportation and deposition ofthe enormous erratic boulders of unknown origin decorating northern Greenlandand Grant Land (Ellesmere Island) in Arctic Canada, was effected by preciselysimilar agencies (Markham, C R 1906. \"On the Next Great Arctic Discovery, theBeaufort Sea\", Geogr }, vol 27, ppl-14). (p. 308)22. The marine character of these now 'high-altitude' remains was reinforced in1911 by Bessel's discovery of a subfossilised Narwhal whale's skeleton at aheight of 1,250 feet (380 metres) above present sea-level on Bylot Island to theNorth of Baffin Island (Bird, J B 1966. The Physiography of Arctic Canada (JohnHopkins Univ. Press), xix + 336pp; see ppl22-123).
