And in the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the m onth of reaping, he clim bed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward; and he beheld the ship com ing with the m ist. Then the gates of his heart were flung open, and his joy flew far over the sea. And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul. But he descended the hill, a sadness cam e upon him , and he thought in his heart: How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city. Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret? Too m any fragm ents of the spirit have I scatterd in these streets, and too many are the children of m y longing that walk naked am ong these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a bruden and an ache. It is not a garm ent I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with m y own hands. 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Nor is it a thought I leave behind m e, but a heart m ade sweet with hunger and with thirst. Yet I cannot tarry longer. The sea that calls all things unto her calls m e, and I m ust em bark. For to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a m ould. Fain would I take with m e all that is here. But how shall I? A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that give it wings. Alone must it seek the ether. And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun. Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea, and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the m en of his own land. And his soul cried out to them , and he said: Sons of m y ancient m other, you riders of the tides, How often have you sailed in m y dream s. And now you com e in m y awakening, which is m y deeper dream . Ready am I to go, and m y eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind. Only another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward, Then I shall stand am ong you, a seafarer am ong seafarers. And you, vast sea, sleepless m other, Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream , Only another winding will this stream m ake, only another m urm ur in this glade, And then shall I com e to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean. And as he walked he saw from afar m en and wom en leaving their fields and their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates. And he heard their voices calling his nam e, and shouting from the field to field telling one another of the com ing of the ship. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"And he said to him self: Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering? And shall it be said that m y eve was in truth m y dawn? And what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in m idfurrow, or to him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress? Shall m y heart becom e a tree heavy-laden with fruit that I m ay gather and give unto them ? And shall m y desires flow like a fountain that I m ay fill their cups? Am I a harp that the hand of the m ighty m ay touch m e, or a flute that his breath m ay pass through m e? A seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that I m ay dispense with confidence? If this is m y day of harvest, in what fields have I sowed the seed, and in what unrem bered seasons? If this indeed be the our in which I lift up m y lantern, it is not m y flam e that shall burn therein. Em pty and dark shall I raise m y lantern, And the guardian of the night shall f ill it with oil and he shall light it also. These things he said in words. But m uch in his heart rem ained unsaid. For he him self could not speak his deeper secret. And when he entered into the city all the people cam e to m eet him , and they were crying out to him as with one voice. And the elders of the city stood forth and said: Go not yet away from us. A noontide have you been in our twilight, and your youth has given us dream s to dream . No stranger are you am ong us, nor a guest, but our son and our dearly beloved. Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"And the priests and the priestesses said unto him : Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our m idst becom e a m emory. You have walked am ong us a spirit, and your shadow has been a light upon our facs. Much have we loved you. But speechless was our love, and with veils has it been veiled. Yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you. And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. And others cam e also and entreated him . But he answered them not. He only bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast. And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the tem ple. And there cam e out of the sanctuary a wom an whose nam e was Alm itra. And she was a seeress. And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city. And she hailed him , saying: Prophet of God, in quest for the utterm ost, long have you searched the distances for your ship. And now your ship has com e, and you m ust needs go. Deep is your longing for the land of your m emories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.

And with a great voice he said: When love beckons to you follow him , Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him , Though the sword hidden am ong his pinions m ay wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him , Though his voice m ay shatter your dream s as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.

All these things shall love do unto you that you m ay know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge becom e a fragm ent of Life' s heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love' s peace and love' s pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love' s threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, \"God is in m y heart,\" but rather, I am in the heart of God.\" And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and m ust needs have desires, let these be your desires: To m elt and be like a running brook that sings its m elody to the night. To know the pain of too m uch tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyf ully.

You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days. Aye, you shall be together even in the silent m emory of God. But let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but m ake not a bond of love: Let it rather be a m oving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other' s cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the sam e loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the sam e mu sic.

They are the sons and daughters of Life' s longing for itself. They com e through you but not from you, And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You m ay give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You m ay house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tom orrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dream s.

And tom orrow, what shall tom orrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrim s to the holy city? And what is fear of need but need itself? Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable? There are those who give little of the m uch which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire m akes their gifts unwholesom e. And there are those who have little and give it all. These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never em pty. There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward. And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism . 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with m indfulness of virtue; They give as in yonder valley the m yrtle breathes its fragrance into space.

It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding; And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving And is there aught you would withhold? All you have shall som e day be given; Therefore give now, that the season of giving m ay be yours and not your inheritors' . You often say, \"I would give, but only to the deserving.\" The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture. They give that they m ay live, for to withhold is to perish. Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you. And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream . And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving? And who are you that m en should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you m ay see their worth naked and their pride unabashed? See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrum ent of giving. For in truth it is life that gives unt o life - while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness. And you receivers - and you are all receivers - assum e no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings; For to be overm indful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for m other, and God for father. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" On Eating & Drinking hen an old m an, a keeper of an inn, said, \"Speak to us of Eating and Drinking.\" And he said: Would that you could live on the fragerance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light. But since you m ust kill to eat, and rob the young of its m other' s m ilk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship, And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still m ore innocent in m any. When you kill a beast say to him in your heart, \"By the sam e power that slays you, I to am slain; and I too shall be consum ed. For the law that delivered you into m y hand shall deliver m e into a m ightier hand.

For to be idle is to becom e a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life' s procession, that m arches in m ajesty and proud subm ission towards the inf inite. When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to m usic. Which of you would be a reed, dum b and silent, when all else sings together in unison? Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a m isfortune. But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth' s furthest dream , assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life through labour is to be intim ate with life' s inm ost secret. But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge, And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, And all work is em pty save when there is love; And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God. And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit, And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching. Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, \"he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil. And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is m ore than he who m akes the sandals for our feet.\" But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not m ore sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass; And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song m ade sweeter by his own loving.

Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter' s oven? And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.

Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you m ight seek one another through vineyards, and com e with the fragrance of the earth in your garm ents.

Or have you only com fort, and the lust for com fort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and becom es a host, and then a m aster? Ay, and it becom es a tam er, and with hook and scourge m akes puppets of your larger desires. Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron. It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh. It m akes m ock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels. Verily the lust for com fort m urders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral. But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tam ed.

And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all. Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self. You are the way and the wayfarers. And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him , a caution against the stum bling stone.

And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts: The m urdered is not unaccountable for his own m urder, And the robbed is not blam eless in being robbed. The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked, And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.

And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed. For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a sham e in their won pride?

When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love m ost in him m ay be clearer in his absence, as the m ountain to the clim ber is clearer from the plain.

And he said: Patient, over-patient, is the captain of m y ship. The wind blows, and restless are the sails; Even the rudder begs direction; Yet quietly m y captain awaits m y silence. And these m y m ariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard m e patiently. Now they shall wait no longer. I am ready. The stream has reached the sea, and once m ore the great m other holds her son against her breast. Fare you well, people of Orphalese. This day has ended. 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"It is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tom orrow.

If in the twilight of m emory we should m eet once m ore, we shall speak again together and you shall sing to m e a deeper song. And if our hands should m eet in another dream , we shall build another tower in the sky. So saying he m ade a signal to the seam en, and straightaway they weighed anchor and cast the ship loose from its m oorings, and they m oved eastward. And a cry cam e from the people as from a single heart, and it rose the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trum peting. Only Alm itra was silent, gazing af ter the ship until it had vanished into the m ist. And when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the sea-wall, rem embering in her heart his saying, A little while, a m oment of rest upon the wind, and another wom an shall bear m e.\" 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Table Of Contents The Com ing of the Ship ................................................................................................. 2 On Love ........................................................................................................................ .7 On Marriage ................................................................................................................. 10 On Children .................................................................................................................. 12 On Giving ..................................................................................................................... 14 On Eating & Drinking .................................................................................................. 17 On W ork ....................................................................................................................... 19 On Joy & Sorrow ......................................................................................................... 22 On Houses .................................................................................................................... 24 On Clothes ................................................................................................................... 27 On Buying & Selling ................................................................................................... 28 On Cri me & Punishm ent .............................................................................................. 30 On Laws ....................................................................................................................... 34 On Freedom ................................................................................................................. 36 On Reason & Passion ................................................................................................... 38 On Pain ........................................................................................................................ . 40 On Self-Knowledge ..................................................................................................... 41 On Teachin g ................................................................................................................. 42 On Friendship ............................................................................................................... 43 On Talking ................................................................................................................... 45 On Ti me ....................................................................................................................... 47 On Good & Evil ........................................................................................................... 49 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"On Prayer ..................................................................................................................... 51 On Pleasure .................................................................................................................. 53 On Beauty .................................................................................................................... 56 On Religion .................................................................................................................. 58 On Death ...................................................................................................................... 60 The Farewell ................................................................................................................ 62 Table Of Contents ........................................................................................................ 70 This eBook is part of the self-im provem ent and self-help books you can dowload freely from http://www.positive-club.com We strongly recom mand you to copy and offer it to your friends.
