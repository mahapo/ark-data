Now, if the recipient of an androgynous degree is candidly instructed that, by the use of these degre€sr the female relatiyes of Masons are put in the possession of the means of making their claims known by what we call oral testimony which, unlike a written certificate, can be neither lost nor destroyed; but that, by her initiation as a uMason's tl4fe' or as t *Heroine of Jericho', she is brought no nearier to the inner portal of Masonry than she was before-if she is honestly told this' then there can hardly be any harm, and there may be some good in these forms if prudently bestowed.

Under each root springs a wonderful fountain endowed with maryelous virtues (Freemaronry's phony code of ethics). From the tree itself springs ^ honey-dew (the birthright of the world's people). The serpent (the military), lies at the under-world fountain (secret funds - black budgets) and enaws at the root of the tree. The squirrel (Troglodyte) runs up and dowfr (under and around), and tries to breed strife between the serpent (the mititary) and the eagle (the people) which sits aloft (a stratery of iensions). This concept was later promoted by a certain Mr' Ashmole- Tubal Cain is said by Freemasons *to denote worldly possessions\". More likely it means *the NWO possession of the world\" (by Troglodytes)- The idea comes from the derivation of Cain - fltmkanoh, to acquire, to gain, and from the theory that Tubal Cain, by his inventions, had enabled his pupils (the workers of the College of Six (6) Days) to acquire riches. Tubal Cain also means that Eve had acquired a man (Adam) with the help of her CREATOR (If this is true that would make Adam, much like Mary's Joseph was later, just a temporary appendage, both to the CREATOR and to wolvIAN.
