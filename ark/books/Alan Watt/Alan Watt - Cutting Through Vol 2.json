An individual vaguely perceives sornething is wrong in his/her l-ife. This takes the form of fatigue at trying to \"keep up\" with real or imaginary crisis, the encroachment of government into every aspect of life, increasing taxation and so on. Sonretimes it takes the loss of work and the realization that the safety-net they contributed to has a gaping hole in the rniddle. 2. The individual discovers that justice is a joke and that all control mech- anisms go up like a pyramid, taking their property, taxes etc. with it. This wealth is then distributed to \"help bail--out\" or \"prop-up\" \"failing\" trans- national corporations. Left-overs are channeled via Overseas Developement Corp- orations to \"developing nations, \" where the loot is pocketed by front-men dictators and their beaurocrats . Crumbs f ilter down to social- servi-ces , which ' after being guzzld. by directors and staff, leave little for the needy except bundles of forms, in triplicate, of course. 3. The individual looks around for others already exposing \"the conspiracy.\" These established champions inform him which \"conspiracy\" books to read. Having then done so, the individual begins to \"expose\" the corruption, first to friends, then when friendl-ess, he either publishes what he has gleaned or becornes para- noid and withdraws frorn society altogether. Why does the wakr-ng-up process fail to spread quickly through society? I.He is terribly naive. He believes the rnassive corruptron \"just happened\" to begin in his own lifetjme, otherwise munu'ny or daddy or teacher would have warned him. It does not occur to hi-m that his parents, teachers etc. were as conditioned as he was. 2. Most people do not wish to know. They, like farm animals, have been dcrnest- icated. Wild animals (original) have natural instincts of self-preservation. They sense the evil intentions of predators and they survj.ve by trusting their own instincts. Wild herds do not \"hang around\" when one or more mernhrs drops dead. Specially bred sheep do. 3. Pavlovian conditiontng/reslrcnse indoctrination has been fed to every indivi- dual vj-a cartoons, through schooling. The media then takes over.
