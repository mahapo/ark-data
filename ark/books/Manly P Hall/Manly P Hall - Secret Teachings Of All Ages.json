Originally published in1928 by the mystical scholar and sage Manly P. Hall (1901-1990), this book—likenone before it and none that have followed—is a codex to the ideas and mysteriesthat resonate within the symbols, myths, and philosophies that have guidedhumankind since its earliest efforts at self-knowledge.The Philosophical Research Society (www.prs.org [http://www.prs.org]) of LosAngeles has been the publisher of The Secret Teachings of All Ages since Mr.Hall founded the organization in 1934. Today, PRS continues to publish theoriginal edition of the Secret Teachings and, through public lectures, research,publications, and the University of Philosophical Research, continues hislegacy. With that legacy in mind, PRS has worked with Tarcher/Penguin to createthis new “Reader’s Edition” of Mr. Hall’s classic work.This edition brings a new level of accessibility to Mr. Hall’s magisterialvolume. The text is fully reset and the pages renumbered according tocontemporary numerals, rather than the Roman numerals of the original edition.The original features fifty-four color plates by die artist J. Augustus Knappand more than two hundred line drawings. This edition includes some of thefinest of the color plates and approximately one hundred of the most pertinentline drawings.Otherwise, the book is largely unaltered. It retains Mr. Hall’s original indexand—with the exception of small excisions for clarity and ease of use—featureshis complete unabridged text. —OBADIAH S. HARRIS, PH.D.PresidentPhilosophical Research SocietyApril 1, 2003"},{"pageContent":"Preface to the Diamond Jubilee Edition On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of this volume, it seems fitting toreflect on the circumstances that led to its writing.The original edition was planned and issued in the interval between thetermination of World War I and the Great Depression of 1929. During this time Ihad a brief career on Wall Street, the outstanding event of which was witnessinga man depressed over investment losses take his life.My fleeting contact with high finance resulted in serious doubts concerningbusiness as it was being conducted at that time. It was apparent thatmaterialism was in complete control of the economic structure, the finalobjective of which was for the individual to become part of a system providingan economic security at the expense of the human soul, mind, and body.I felt strongly moved to explore the problems of humanity, its origin anddestiny, and I spent a number of quiet hours in the New York Public Librarytracing the confused course of civilization. With a very few exceptions modernauthorities downgraded all systems of idealistic philosophy and the deeperaspects of comparative religion. Translations of classical authors could differgreatly, but in most cases the noblest thoughts were eliminated or denigrated.Those more sincere authors whose knowledge of ancient languages was profoundwere never included as required reading, and scholarship was based largely uponthe acceptance of a sterile materialism.Fortunately, since contemporary scholarship had little regard for the wisdom ofthe past, there was no premium on the earlier texts. As a result I assembled afair collection of the works of those forgotten sages to whose labors the worldowes a tremendous debt of gratitude. It seems that my efforts were timely, andthe first two editions of the book were sold out before the volume came off thepress. There was certainly a blessing upon the book. Written by a young man inhis twenties, it has now passed through a number of editions with over thirtyprintings and is still a best seller in its field.We are now coming to the end of the twentieth century, and the greatmaterialistic progress which we have venerated for so long is on the verge ofbankruptcy. We can no longer believe that we are born into this world toaccumulate wealth and abandon ourselves to mortal pleasures. We see the dangersand realize that we have been exploited for centuries. We were told that thetwentieth century was the most progressive that the world has ever known, butunfortunately the progression was in the direction of self-destruction.To avoid a future of war, crime, and bankruptcy, the individual must begin toplan his own destiny, and the best source of the necessary information comesdown to us through the writings of the ancients. We have tried to select themost useful and practical elements of classical idealism, combining them into asingle volume. The greatest knowledge of all time should be available to thetwentieth century not only in the one shilling editions of the Bohn Library insmall type and shabby binding, but in a book that would be a monument, notmerely a coffin. John Henry Nash, who designed this book, agreed with me.It is our sincere hope that this book will endure into the twenty-first centuryand continue to make available the contents of countless books and manuscriptsthat have been destroyed by the ravages of war. This volume is not devoted to myown opinions but is a tribute to the memories and labors of the noblest ofmankind. May the twenty-first century bring with it a restoration of thosesystems of inspired instruction so desperately needed. —MANLY P. HALLLos Angeles, CaliforniaOctober 1, 1988"},{"pageContent":"Foreword It is an honor to have been invited to write this Foreword. My aim shall be toset forth briefly what a careful study of this important volume, over a periodof years, has meant to me.Associations of men and women bound together by oaths and obligations intoesoteric fraternities have descended from the earliest times and bear witness toa natural inclination to perpetuate doctrines which lead to the good of mankind.With the growth of social consciousness, these secret societies became thecustodians of the highest cultural concepts. Their initiation rites weresymbolic pageantries suitable to inspire veneration for the Divine Mysteries,and admiration for the powers of nature and of God. Most of the mythologies ofclassical nations were originally rituals of secret societies, and it is amistake to assume that earlier cultures accepted as literal the elaboratetheology and legendry found in their traditions.Historically the secret societies were closely identified with state religions.Basic knowledge was believed to have been bestowed by the gods in a remote age.The esoteric philosophies have always been taught by means of secretorganizations, to which candidates were admitted only after appropriatepreparation and initiatory rites. These spiritual brotherhoods of scholars,sages, and mystics have flourished among all peoples, ancient and modern, and inall parts of the world.In the program of the Mysteries each individual must grow into the comprehensionof truth. Before he could be entrusted with the divine powers of mind and will,he must accept knowledge as a responsibility to his Creator and his world,rather than as an opportunity for the advancement of personal ambitions. Themasters of the Mysteries taught secret practices and disciplines by which theproperly qualified disciples could develop the potent abilities latent withinthe soul, and so, come into conscious communication with spiritual realities.Initiates of the philosophical societies came to be regarded as possessingextraordinary faculties and powers. They enjoyed the special favor of thedivinities, performed miracles, and were worthy of the title “Twice-Born,” forthey had come to second birth from the womb of the Mysteries. Theseadepts-philosophers were the truly evolved human beings. Most of the arts andsciences which enriched the modern world were discovered, developed, and in manyinstances perfected by these initiate philosophers and priests.Scholarship was recognized as the pursuit most suitable to the abilities of man.But scholarship was always the means, never the end. The end of the sacredsciences was the abstraction of the human soul from bondage to the senses andits preparation to receive within itself the light of vast truths. Some men arenaturally suited to higher learning for they possess integrity of motive, thepatience of effort, and the vision of ends—these labored toward the soul’simprovement, and championed enlightened progress above other considerations.Those of different opinion opposed the Mystery Schools.It was inevitable that the initiates of the Mysteries should unite themselvesagainst the forces seeking their extinction. Thus, while the secret doctrinewith its body of disciples functioned more or less openly in ancient society, itlater passed almost completely from public view. This circumstance should not beinterpreted as a decline of plan or purpose. The esoteric schools remained as apowerful force for the regeneration of human institutions.Those who do not understand the spiritual sciences question their use of unusualsymbols, myths, and figures employed to conceal the essential teaching. Let itbe remembered that these “clouds” were no part of the original doctrine, butwere made necessary by intolerance and bigotry. The use of indirectcommunication was based entirely upon practical considerations. To remainunknown was the best way to prevent a repetition of the disaster which occurredto the Knights Templars. The “veils” which concealed the arcana of the Mysterieswere not employed to cover ignorance, but to protect wisdom, and in Europe itwas protected for a thousand years.The secrets of the Mysteries are obviously metaphysical, philosophical, andesoteric and relate to processes taking place within the fields of the humanpsyche during the practice of the spiritual disciplines. Discipleship ends inthe attainment of an inner capacity suitable for the realization of the esoterictradition. The disciplines, by expanding consciousness, give the initiatepractical mastery over that which is learned and constant awareness as to theproper use of higher learning.If these sacred academies imparted only scientific, intellectual, ethical orcultural doctrines somewhat in advance of their time, they could produce onlyscholars. The initiates of the esoteric tradition were never regarded merely asbrilliant intellectuals. From white-walled Memphis to rock-hewn Ellora, theywere honored as practicing a higher dimension of essential knowledge. Historypreserves the records of numerous persons, living in different times and invarious places, who have exhibited a knowledge and skill which cannot beexplained according to present standards of erudition. We cannot ignore thetestimonies of such learned men as Pythagoras, Buddha, and Plotinus. Many of thenoblest members of our race have expressed their profound admiration for theesoteric institutions flourishing in their own times. Not to recognize theesoteric sciences is to disregard most that has contributed to the advancementand improvement of the human state during the last five thousand years. Therebeing a divine order of learning superior to mundane knowledge, and its beingavailable—the time is most appropriate for the further restoration of thissacred tradition.Adeptship is the state of complete spiritual maturity so far as this is possibleto a member of the human family. Deficient in nothing necessary to a life ofwisdom, the adept is sufficient to his own needs and capable of determining thatcourse of personal action most likely to contribute to enlightenment. The adeptsforeshadow the state of mankind when it will have attained the full release ofits faculties and its powers. The adept is, therefore, the truly evolved of ourspecies. Accordingly, the adepts, considered together as the citizens of aninvisible empire of the philosophic elect, constitute the heroic elder brothers,the custodians and protectors of humanity As the interpreters of the Mysteries,they are the true educators and illuminators. As the redeemed, the servants ofDivine purpose, they comprise a powerful, creative and directive force in theworld.The science of life is, therefore, the supreme science, and the art of living,the finest of the arts. There have always been truth-seekers willing toacknowledge the sovereignty of the eternal over the temporal. These havededicated themselves to the mastery of life, and have perpetuated fromgeneration to generation the knowledge and skill they accumulated. This body ofessential knowledge is the esoteric tradition. The institutions whichperpetuated this tradition are the Mystery Schools, and the graduates of theseschools are the adepts.This volume reveals that the lore and legendry of the world, the scriptures andsacred books, and the great philosophical systems all tell the same story. Humanambition may produce the tyrant; divine aspiration will produce the adept. Thisthen, seems to me to be the significant message of Manly P. Hall’s encyclopedictome. So, my sincere wish is that this contribution by our friend may mean asmuch in your life as it has in mine. —HENRY L. DRAKEVice PresidentPhilosophical Research Society1975"},{"pageContent":"Preface Numerous volumes have been written as commentaries upon the secret systems ofphilosophy existing in the ancient world, but the ageless truths of life, likemany of the earth’s greatest thinkers, have usually been clothed in shabby gar]ments. The present work is an attempt to supply a tome worthy of those seersand sages whose thoughts are the substance of its pages. To bring about thiscoalescence of Beauty and Truth has proved most costly, but I believe that theresult will produce an effect upon the mind of the reader which will more thanjustify the expenditure.Work upon the text of this volume was begun the first day of January, 1926, andhas continued almost uninterruptedly for over two years. The greater part of theresearch work, however, was carried on prior to the writing of the manuscript.The collection of reference material was begun in 1921, and three years laterthe plans for the book took definite form. For the sake of clarity, allfootnotes were eliminated, the various quotations and references to otherauthors being embodied in the text in their logical order. The bibliography isappended primarily to assist those interested in selecting for future study themost authoritative and important items dealing with philosophy and symbolism. Tomake readily accessible the abstruse information contained in the book, anelaborate topical cross index is included.I make no claim for either the infallibility or the originality of any statementherein contained. I have studied the fragmentary writings of the ancientssufficiently to realize that dogmatic utterances concerning their tenets areworse than foolhardy. Traditionalism is the curse of modern philosophy,particularly that of the European schools. While many of the statementscontained in this treatise may appear at first wildly fantastic, I havesincerely endeavored to refrain from haphazard metaphysical speculation,presenting the material as far as possible in the spirit rather than the letterof the original authors. By assuming responsibility only for the mistakes whichmay appear herein, I hope to escape the accusation of plagiarism which has beendirected against nearly every writer on the subject of mystical philosophy.Having no particular ism of my own to promulgate, I have not attempted to twistthe original writings to substantiate preconceived notions, nor have I distorteddoctrines in any effort to reconcile the irreconcilable differences present inthe various systems of religio-philosophic thought.The entire theory of the book is diametrically opposed to the modern method ofthinking, for it is concerned with subjects openly ridiculed by the sophists ofthe twentieth century. Its true purpose is to introduce the mind of the readerto a hypothesis of living wholly beyond the pale of materialistic theology,philosophy, or science. The mass of abstruse material between its covers is notsusceptible to perfect organization, but so far as possible related topics havebeen grouped together.Rich as the English language is in media of expression, it is curiously lackingin terms suitable to the conveyance of abstract philosophical premises. Acertain intuitive grasp of the subtler meanings concealed within groups ofinadequate words is necessary therefore to an understanding of the ancientMystery Teachings.Although the majority of the items in the bibliography are in my own library, Iwish to acknowledge gratefully the assistance rendered by the Public Librariesof San Francisco and Los Angeles, the libraries of the Scottish Rite in SanFrancisco and Los Angeles, the libraries of the University of California inBerkeley and Los Angeles, the Mechanics’ Library in San Francisco, and theKrotona Theosophical Library at Ojai, California. Special recognition for theirhelp is also due to the following persons: Mrs. Max Heindel, Mrs. Alice PalmerHenderson, Mr. Ernest Dawson and staff, Mr. John Howell, Mr. Paul Elder, Mr.Phillip Watson Hackett, and Mr. John R. Ruckstell. Single books were lent byother persons and organizations, to whom thanks are also given.The matter of translation was the greatest single task in the research workincident to the preparation of this volume. The necessary German translations,which required nearly three years, were generously undertaken by Mr. AlfredBeri, who declined all remuneration for his labor. The Latin, Italian, French,and Spanish translations were made by Prof. Homer P. Earle. The Hebrew text wasedited by Rabbi Jacob M. Alkow. Miscellaneous short translations and checkingalso were done by various individuals.The editorial work was under the supervision of Dr. C. B. Rowlingson, throughwhose able efforts literary order was often brought out of literary chaos.Special recognition is also due the services rendered by Mr. Robert B. Tum-monds, of the staff of H. S. Crocker Company, Inc., to whom were assigned thetechnical difficulties of fitting the text matter into its allotted space. Formuch of the literary charm of the work I am also indebted to Mr. M. M. Saxton,to whom the entire manuscript was first dictated and to whom was also entrustedthe preparation of the index. The splendid efforts of Mr.J. Augustus Knapp, theillustrator, have resulted in a series of color plates which add materially tothe beauty and completeness of the work.The printing of the book was in the hands of Mr. Frederick E. Keast, of H. S.Crocker Company, Inc., whose great personal interest in the volume has beenmanifested by an untiring effort to improve the quality thereof. Through thegracious cooperation of Dr. John Henry Nash, the foremost designer of printingon the American Continent, the book appears in a unique and appropriate form,embodying the finest elements of the printer’s craft. An increase in the numberof plates and also a finer quality of workmanship than was first contemplatedhave been made possible by Mr. C. E. Benson, of the Los Angeles EngravingCompany, who entered heart and soul into the production of this volume.The pre-publication sale of this book has been without known precedent. Thesubscription list for the first edition of 550 copies was closed a year beforethe manuscript was given to the printer. The second, or King Solomon, edition,550 copies; the third, or Theosophical, edition, 200 copies; and the fourth, orRosicrucian, edition, 100 copies, were sold before the finished volume wasreceived from the printer. For so ambitious a production, this constitutes aunique achievement. The credit for this extraordinary sales program belongs toMrs. Maud F. Galigher, who had as her ideal not to sell the book in thecommercial sense of the word but to place it in the hands of those particularlyinterested in the subject matter it contains. Valuable assistance in thisrespect was also rendered by numerous friends who had attended my lectures andwho without compensation undertook and successfully accomplished thedistribution of the book.In conclusion, the author wishes to acknowledge gratefully his indebtedness toeach one of the hundreds of subscribers through whose advance payments thepublication of this folio was made possible. To undertake the enormous expenseinvolved was entirely beyond his individual means and those who invested in thevolume had no assurance of its production and no security other than their faithin the integrity of the writer.I sincerely hope that each reader will profit from the perusal of this book,even as I have profited from the writing of it. The years of labor and thoughtexpended upon it have meant much to me. The research work discovered to me manygreat truths; the writing of it discovered to me the laws of order and patience;the printing of it discovered to me new wonders of the arts and crafts; and thewhole enterprise has discovered to me a multitude of friends whom otherwise Imight never have known.

HALL> Los Angeles, California> May 28,1928> "},{"pageContent":"I Introduction Philosophy is the science of estimating values. The superiority of any state orsubstance over another is determined by philosophy. By assigning a position ofprimary importance to what remains when all that is secondary has been removed,philosophy thus becomes the true index of priority or emphasis in the realm ofspeculative thought. The mission of philosophy a priori is to establish therelation of manifested things to their invisible ultimate cause or nature.“Philosophy,” writes Sir William Hamilton, “has been defined [as]: The scienceof things divine and human, and of the causes in which they are contained[Cicero]; The science of effects by their causes [Hobbes]; The science ofsufficient reasons [Leibnitz]; The science of things possible, inasmuch as theyare possible [Wolf]; The science of things evidently deduced from firstprinciples [Descartes]; The science of truths, sensible and abstract [deCondillac]; The application of reason to its legitimate objects [Tennemann]; Thescience of the relations of all knowledge to the necessary ends of human reason[Kant]; The science of the original form of the ego or mental self [Krug]; Thescience of sciences [Fichte]; The science of the absolute [von Schelling]; Thescience of the absolute indifference of the ideal and real [von Schelling]—or,The identity of identity and non-identity [Hegel].” (See Lectures on Metaphysicsand Logic.)The six headings under which the disciplines of philosophy are commonlyclassified are: metaphysics, which deals with such abstract subjects ascosmology, theology, and the nature of being; logic, which deals with the lawsgoverning rational thinking, or, as it has been called, “the doctrine offallacies”; ethics, which is the science of morality, individual responsibility,and character—concerned chiefly with an effort to determine the nature of good;psychology, which is devoted to investigation and classification of those formsof phenomena referable to a mental origin; epistemology, which is the scienceconcerned primarily with the nature of knowledge itself and the question ofwhether it may exist in an absolute form; and asthetics, which is the science ofthe nature of and the reactions awakened by the beautiful, the harmonious, theelegant, and the noble.003 [images/00004.jpg] PLATO.Plato’s real name was Aristocles. When his father brought him to study withSocrates, the great Skeptic declared that on the previous night he had dreamedof a white swan, which was an omen that his new disciple was to become one ofthe world’s illumined. There is a tradition that the immortal Plato was sold asa slave by the King of Sicily. Plato regarded philosophy as the greatest good ever imparted by Divinity to man.In the twentieth century, however, it has become a ponderous and complicatedstructure of arbitrary and irreconcilable notions—yet each substantiated byalmost incon- testible logic. The lofty theorems of the old Academy whichIamblichus likened to the nectar and ambrosia of the gods have been soadulterated by opinion—which Heraclitus declared to be a falling sickness of themind—that the heavenly mead would now be quite unrecognizable to this greatNeo-Platonist. Convincing evidence of the increasing superficiality of modernscientific and philosophic thought is its persistent drift towards materialism.When the great astronomer Laplace was asked by Napoleon why he had not mentionedGod in his Traité de La Mécanique Céleste, the mathematician naively replied:“Sire, I had no need for that hypothesis!”In his treatise on Atheism, Sir Francis Bacon tersely summarizes the situationthus: “A little philosophy inclineth man’s mind to atheism; but depth inphilosophy bringeth men’s minds about to religion.” The Metaphysics of Aristotleopens with these words: “All men naturally desire to know.” To satisfy thiscommon urge the unfolding human intellect has explored the extremities ofimaginable space without and the extremities of imaginable self within, seekingto estimate the relationship between the one and the all; the effect and thecause; Nature and the groundwork of Nature; the mind and the source of the mind;the spirit and the substance of the spirit; the illusion and the reality.An ancient philosopher once said: “He who has not even a knowledge of commonthings is a brute among men. He who has an accurate knowledge of human concernsalone is a man among brutes. But he who knows all that can be known byintellectual energy, is a God among men.” Man’s status in the natural world isdetermined, therefore, by the quality of his thinking. He whose mind is enslavedto his bestial instincts is philosophically not superior to the brute; he whoserational faculties ponder human affairs is a man; and he whose intellect iselevated to the consideration of divine realities is already a demigod, for hisbeing partakes of the luminosity with which his reason has brought him intoproximity. In his encomium of “the science of sciences” Cicero is led toexclaim: “O philosophy, life’s guide! O searcher-out of virtue and expeller ofvices! What could we and every age of men have been without thee? Thou hastproduced cities; thou hast called men scattered about into the social enjoymentof life.”In this age the word philosophy has little meaning unless accompanied by someother qualifying term. The body of philosophy has been broken up into numerousisms more or less antagonistic, which have become so concerned with the effortto disprove each other’s fallacies that the sublimer issues of divine order andhuman destiny have suffered deplorable neglect. The ideal function of philosophyis to serve as the stabilizing influence in human thought. By virtue of itsintrinsic nature it should prevent man from ever establishing unreasonable codesof life. Philosophers themselves, however, have frustrated the ends ofphilosophy by exceeding in their woolgathering those untrained minds whom theyare supposed to lead in the straight and narrow path of rational thinking. Tolist and classify any but the more important of the now recognized schools ofthe philosophy is beyond the space limitations of this volume. The vast area ofspeculation covered by philosophy will be appreciated best after a briefconsideration of a few of the outstanding systems of philosophic disciplinewhich have swayed the world of thought during the last twenty-six centuries.The Greek school of philosophy had its inception with the seven immortalizedthinkers upon whom was first conferred the appellation of Sophos, “the wise.”According to Diogenes Laertius, these were Thales, Solon, Chilon, Pitta- cus,Bias, Cleobulus, and Periander. Water was conceived by Thales to be the primalprinciple or element, upon which the earth floated like a ship, and earthquakeswere the result of disturbances in this universal sea. Since Thales was anIonian, the school perpetuating his tenets became known as the Ionic. He died in546 B.C., and was succeeded by Anaximander, who in turn was followed byAnaximenes, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus, with whom the Ionic school ended.Anaximander, differing from his master Thales, declared measureless andindefinable infinity to be the principle from which all things were generated.Anaximenes asserted air to be the first element of the universe; that souls andeven the Deity itself were composed of it.Anaxagoras (whose doctrine savors of atomism) held God to be “an infiniteself-moving mind; that this divine infinite Mind, not inclosed in any body, isthe efficient cause of all things; out of the infinite matter consisting ofsimilar parts, everything being made according to its species by the divinemind, who when all things were at first confusedly mingled together, came andreduced them to order.” Archelaus declared the principle of all things to betwofold: mind (which was incorporeal) and air (which was corporeal), therarefaction and condensation of the latter resulting in fire and waterrespectively. The stars were conceived by Archelaus to be burning iron plates.Heraclitus (who lived 536-470 B.C. and is sometimes included in the Ionicschool) in his doctrine of change and eternal flux asserted fire to be the firstelement and also the state into which the world would ultimately be reabsorbed.The soul of the world he regarded as an exhalation from its humid parts, and hedeclared the ebb and flow of the sea to be caused by the sun.After Pythagoras of Samos, its founder, the Italic or Pythagorean school numbersamong its most distinguished representatives Empedocles, Epichar- mus, Archytas,Alcmæon, Hippasus, Philolaus, and Eudoxus. Pythagoras (580-500? B.C.) conceivedmathematics to be the most sacred and exact of all the sciences, and demanded ofall who came to him for study a familiarity with arithmetic, music, astronomy,and geometry. He laid special emphasis upon the Philosophic life as aprerequisite to wisdom. Pythagoras was one of the first teachers to establish acommunity wherein all the members were of mutual assistance to one another inthe common attainment of the higher sciences. He also introduced the disciplineof retrospection as essential to the development of the spiritual mind.Pythagoreanism may be summarized as a system of metaphysical speculationconcerning the relationships between numbers and the causal agencies ofexistence. This school also first expounded the theory of celestial harmonics or“the music of the spheres.” John Reuchlin said of Pythagoras that he taughtnothing to his disciples before the discipline of silence, silence being thefirst rudiment of contemplation. In his Sophist, Aristotle credits Empedocleswith the discovery of rhetoric. Both Pythagoras and Empedocles accepted thetheory of transmigration, the latter saying: “A boy I was, then did a maidbecome; a plant, bird, fish, and in the vast sea swum.” Archytas is creditedwith invention of the screw and the crane. Pleasure he declared to be apestilence because it was opposed to the temperance of the mind; he considered aman without deceit to be as rare as a fish without bones.The Eleatic sect was founded by Xenophanes (570-480 B.C.), who was conspicuousfor his attacks upon the cosmologic and theogonic fables of Homer and Hesiod.Xenophanes declared that God was “one and incorporeal, in substance and figureround, in no way resembling man; that He is all sight and all hearing, butbreathes not; that He is all things, the mind and wisdom, not generate buteternal, impassible, immutable, and rational.” Xenophanes believed that allexisting things were eternal, that the world was without beginning or end, andthat everything which was generated was subject to corruption. He lived to greatage and is said to have buried his sons with his own hands. Parmenides studiedunder Xenophanes, but never entirely subscribed to his doctrines. Parmenidesdeclared the senses to be uncertain and reason the only criterion of truth. Hefirst asserted the earth to be round and also divided its surface into zones ofheat and cold.Melissus, who is included in the Eleatic school, held many opinions in commonwith Parmenides. He declared the universe to be immovable because, occupying allspace, there was no place to which it could be moved. He further rejected thetheory of a vacuum in space. Zeno of Elea also maintained that a vacuum couldnot exist. Rejecting the theory of motion, he asserted that there was but oneGod, who was an eternal, ungenerated Being. Like Xenophanes, he conceived Deityto be spherical in shape. Leucippus held the Universe to consist of two parts:one full and the other a vacuum. From the Infinite a host of minute fragmentarybodies descended into the vacuum, where, through continual agitation, theyorganized themselves into spheres of substance.The great Democritus to a certain degree enlarged upon the atomic theory ofLeucippus. Democritus declared the principles of all things to be twofold: atomsand vacuum. Both, he asserted, are infinite—atoms in number, vacuum inmagnitude. Thus all bodies must be composed of atoms or vacuum. Atoms possessedtwo properties, form and size, both characterized by infinite variety. The soulDemocritus also conceived to be atomic in structure and subject to dissolutionwith the body. The mind he believed to be composed of spiritual atoms. Aristotleintimates that Democritus obtained his atomic theory from the Pythagoreandoctrine of the Monad. Among the Eleatics are also included Pro- tagoras andAnaxarchus.Socrates (469-399 B.C.), the founder of the Socratic sect, being fundamentally aSkeptic, did not force his opinions upon others, but through the medium ofquestionings caused each man to give expression to his own philosophy. Accordingto Plutarch, Socrates conceived every place as appropriate for teaching in thatthe whole world was a school of virtue. He held that the soul existed before thebody and, prior to immersion therein, was endowed with all knowledge; that whenthe soul entered into the material form it became stupefied, but that bydiscourses upon sensible objects it was caused to reawaken and to recover itsoriginal knowledge. On these premises was based his attempt to stimulate thesoul-power through irony and inductive reasoning. It has been said of Socratesthat the sole subject of his philosophy was man. He himself declared philosophyto be the way of true happiness and its purpose twofold: (1) to contemplate God,and (2) to abstract the soul from corporeal sense.The principles of all things he conceived to be three in number: God, matter,and ideas. Of God he said: “What He is I know not; what He is not I know.”Matter he defined as the subject of generation and corruption; idea, as anincorruptible substance—the intellect of God. Wisdom he considered the sum ofthe virtues. Among the prominent members of the Socratic sect were Xenophon,Æschines, Crito, Simon, Glauco, Simmias, and Cebes. Professor Zeller, the greatauthority on ancient philosophies, has recently declared the writings ofXenophon relating to Socrates to be forgeries. When The Clouds of Aristophanes,a comedy written to ridicule the theories of Socrates, was first presented, thegreat Skeptic himself attended the play. During the performance, whichcaricatured him seated in a basket high in the air studying the sun, Socratesrose calmly in his seat, the better to enable the Athenian spectators to comparehis own unprepossessing features with the grotesque mask worn by the actorimpersonating him.The Elean sect was founded by Phædo of Elis, a youth of noble family, who wasbought from slavery at the instigation of Socrates and who became his devoteddisciple. Plato so highly admired Phædo’s mentality that he named one of themost famous of his discourses the Phœdo. Phaedo was succeeded in his school byPlisthenes, who in turn was followed by Menedemus. Of the doctrines of the Eleansect little is known. Menedemus is presumed to have been inclined toward theteachings of Stilpo and the Megarian sect. When Menedemus’ opinions weredemanded, he answered that he was free, thus intimating that most men wereenslaved to their opinions. Menedemus was apparently of a somewhat belligerenttemperament and often returned from his lectures in a badly bruised condition.The most famous of his propositions is stated thus: That which is not the sameis different from that with which it is not the same. This point being admitted,Menedemus continued: To benefit is not the same as good, therefore good does notbenefit. After the time of Menedemus the Elean sect became known as theEretrian. Its exponents denounced all negative propositions and all complex andabstruse theories, declaring that only affirmative and simple doctrines could betrue.The Megarian sect was founded by Euclid of Megara (not the celebratedmathematician), a great admirer of Socrates. The Athenians passed a lawdecreeing death to any citizen of Megara found in the city of Athens. Nothingdaunted, Euclid donned woman’s clothing and went at night to study withSocrates. After the cruel death of their teacher, the disciples of Socrates,fearing a similar fate, fled to Megara, where they were entertained with greathonor by Euclid. The Megarian school accepted the Socratic doctrine that virtueis wisdom, adding to it the Eleatic concept that goodness is absolute unity andall change an illusion of the senses. Euclid maintained that good has noopposite and therefore evil does not exist. Being asked about the nature of thegods, he declared himself ignorant of their disposition save that they hatedcurious persons.The Megarians are occasionally included among the dialectic philosophers. Euclid(who died in 374? B.C.) was succeeded in his school by Eubulides, among whosedisciples were Alexinus and Apollonius Cronus. Euphantus, who lived to great ageand wrote many tragedies, was among the foremost followers of Eubulides.Diodorus is usually included in the Megarian school, having heard Eubulideslecture. According to legend, Diodorus died of grief because he could not answerinstantly certain questions asked him by Stilpo, at one time master of theMegarian school. Diodorus held that nothing can be moved, since to be moved itmust be taken out of the place in which it is and put into the place where it isnot, which is impossible because all things must always be in the places wherethey are.The Cynics were a sect founded by Antisthenes of Athens (444-365? B.C.), adisciple of Socrates. Their doctrine may be described as an extremeindividualism which considers man as existing for himself alone and advocatessurrounding him by inharmony, suffering, and direst need that he may thereby bedriven to retire more completely into his own nature. The Cynics renounced allworldly possessions, living in the rudest shelters and subsisting upon thecoarsest and simplest food. On the assumption that the gods wanted nothing, theCynics affirmed that those whose needs were fewest consequently approachedclosest to the divinities. Being asked what he gained by a life of philosophy,Antisthenes replied that he had learned how to converse with himself.Diogenes of Sinopis is remembered chiefly for the tub in the Metroum which formany years served him as a home. The people of Athens loved thebeggar-philosopher, and when a youth in jest bored holes in the tub, the citypresented Diogenes with a new one and punished the youth. Diogenes believed thatnothing in life can be rightly accomplished without exercitation. He maintainedthat everything in the world belongs to the wise, a declaration which he provedby the following logic: “All things belong to the gods; the gods are friends towise persons; all things are common amongst friends; therefore all things belongto the wise.” Among the Cynics are Monimus, Onesicritus, Crates, Metrocles,Hipparchia (who married Crates), Menippus, and Menedemus.The Cyrenaic sect, founded by Aristippus of Cyrene (435-356? B.C.), promulgatedthe doctrine of hedonism. Learning of the fame of Socrates, Aristippus journeyedto Athens and applied himself to the teachings of the great Skeptic. Socrates,pained by the voluptuous and mercenary tendencies of Aristippus, vainly laboredto reform the young man. Aristippus has the distinction of being consistent inprinciple and practice, for he lived in perfect harmony with his philosophy thatthe quest of pleasure was the chief purpose of life. The doctrines of theCyrenaics may be summarized thus: All that is actually known concerning anyobject or condition is the feeling which it awakens in man’s own nature. In thesphere of ethics that which awakens the most pleasant feeling is consequently tobe esteemed as the greatest good. Emotional reactions are classified as pleasantor gentle, harsh, and mean. The end of pleasant emotion is pleasure; the end ofharsh emotion, grief; the end of mean emotion, nothing.Through mental perversity some men do not desire pleasure. In reality, however,pleasure (especially of a physical nature) is the true end of existence andexceeds in every way mental and spiritual enjoyments. Pleasure, furthermore, islimited wholly to the moment; now is the only time. The past cannot be regardedwithout regret and the future cannot be faced without misgiving; thereforeneither is conducive to pleasure. No man should grieve, for grief is the mostserious of all diseases. Nature permits man to do anything he desires; he islimited only by his own laws and customs. A philosopher is one free from envy,love, and superstition, and whose days are one long round of pleasure.Indulgence was thus elevated by Aristippus to the chief position among thevirtues. He further declared philosophers to differ markedly from other men inthat they alone would not change the order of their lives if all the laws of menwere abolished. Among prominent philosophers influenced by the Cyrenaicdoctrines were Hegesias, Anniceris, Theodorus, and Bion.The sect of the Academic philosophers instituted by Plato (427-347 B.C.) wasdivided into three major parts—the old, the middle, and the new Academy. Amongthe old Academics were Speusippus, Zenocrates, Poleman, Crates, and Crantor.Arcesilaus instituted the middle Academy and Carneades founded the new. Chiefamong the masters of Plato was Socrates. Plato traveled widely and was initiatedby the Egyptians into the profundities of Hermetic philosophy. He also derivedmuch from the doctrines of the Pythagoreans. Cicero describes the threefoldconstitution of Platonic philosophy as comprising ethics, physics, anddialectics. Plato defined good as threefold in character: good in the soul,expressed through the virtues; good in the body, expressed through the symmetryand endurance of the parts; and good in the external world, expressed throughsocial position and companionship. In The Book of Speusippus on PlatonicDefinitions, that great Platonist thus defines God: “A being that livesimmortally by means of Himself alone, sufficing for His own blessedness, theeternal Essence, cause of His own goodness.” According to Plato, the One is theterm most suitable for defining the Absolute, since the whole precedes the partsand diversity is dependent on unity, but unity not on diversity. The One,moreover, is before being, for to be is an attribute or condition of the One.Platonic philosophy is based upon the postulation of three orders of being: thatwhich moves unmoved, that which is self-moved, and that which is moved. Thatwhich is immovable but moves is anterior to that which is self-moved, whichlikewise is anterior to that which it moves. That in which motion is inherentcannot be separated from its motive power; it is therefore incapable ofdissolution. Of such nature are the immortals. That which has motion imparted toit from another can be separated from the source of its animating principle; itis therefore subject to dissolution. Of such nature are mortal beings. Superiorto both the mortals and the immortals is that condition which continually movesyet itself is unmoved. To this constitution the power of abidance is inherent;it is therefore the Divine Permanence upon which all things are established.Being nobler even than self-motion, the unmoved Mover is the first of alldignities. The Platonic discipline was founded upon the theory that learning isreally reminiscence, or the bringing into objectivity of knowledge formerlyacquired by the soul in a previous state of existence. At the entrance of thePlatonic school in the Academy were written the words: “Let none ignorant ofgeometry enter here.”After the death of Plato, his disciples separated into two groups. One, theAcademics, continued to meet in the Academy where once he had presided; theother, the Peripatetics, removed to the Lyceum under the leadership of Aristotle(384-322 B.C.). Plato recognized Aristotle as his greatest disciple and,according to Philoponus, referred to him as “the mind of the school.” IfAristotle were absent from the lectures, Plato would say: “The intellect is nothere.” Of the prodigious genius of Aristotle, Thomas Taylor writes in hisintroduction to The Metaphysics:“When we consider that he was not only well acquainted with every science, ashis works abundantly evince, but that he wrote on almost every subject which iscomprehended in the circle of human knowledge, and this with matchless accuracyand skill, we know not which to admire most, the penetration or extent of hismind.” Of the philosophy of Aristotle, the same author says: “The end ofAristotle’s moral philosophy is perfection through the virtues, and the end ofhis contemplative philosophy an union with the one principle of all things.”Aristotle conceived philosophy to be twofold: practical and theoretical.Practical philosophy embraced ethics and politics; theoretical philosophy,physics and logic. Metaphysics he considered to be the science concerning thatsubstance which has the principle of motion and rest inherent to itself. ToAristotle the soul is that by which man first lives, feels, and understands.Hence to the soul he assigned three faculties: nutritive, sensitive, andintellective. He further considered the soul to be twofold—rational andirrational—and in some particulars elevated the sense perceptions above themind. Aristotle defined wisdom as the science of first Causes. The four majordivisions of his philosophy are dialectics, physics, ethics, and metaphysics.God is defined as the First Mover, the Best of beings, an immovable Substance,separate from sensible things, void of corporeal quantity, without parts andindivisible. Platonism is based upon a Priori reasoning; Aristotelianism upon aposteriori reasoning. Aristotle taught his pupil, Alexander the Great, to feelthat if he had not done a good deed he had not reigned that day. Among hisfollowers were Theophrastus, Strato, Lyco, Aristo, Critolaus, and Diodorus.Of Skepticism as propounded by Pyrrho of Elis (365-275 B.C.) and by Timon,Sextus Empiricus said that those who seek must find or deny they have found orcan find, or persevere in the inquiry. Those who suppose they have found truthare called Dogmatists; those who think it incomprehensible are the Academics;those who still seek are the Skeptics. The attitude of Skepticism towards theknowable is summed up by Sextus Empiricus in the following words: “But the chiefground of Skepticism is that to every reason there is an opposite reasonequivalent, which makes us forbear to dogmatize.” The Skeptics were stronglyopposed to the Dogmatists and were agnostic in that they held the acceptedtheories regarding Deity to be self-contradictory and undemonstrable. “How,”asked the Skeptic, “can we have indubitate knowledge of God, knowing not Hissubstance, form or place; for, while philosophers disagree irreconcilably onthese points, their conclusions cannot be considered as un- doubtably true?”Since absolute knowledge was considered unattainable, the Skeptics declared theend of their discipline to be: “In opinionatives, indistur- bance; inimpulsives, moderation; and in disquietives, suspension.”The sect of the Stoics was founded by Zeno (340-265 B.C.), the Cittiean, whostudied under Crates the Cynic, from which sect the Stoics had their origin.Zeno was succeeded by Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Zeno of Tanis, Diogenes, Antipater,Panætius, and Posidonius. Most famous of the Roman Stoics are Epictetus andMarcus Aurelius. The Stoics were essentially pantheists, since they maintainedthat as there is nothing better than the world, the world is God. Zeno declaredthat the reason of the world is diffused throughout it as seed. Stoicism is amaterialistic philosophy, enjoining voluntary resignation to natural law.Chrysippus maintained that good and evil being contrary, both are necessarysince each sustains the other. The soul was regarded as a body distributedthroughout the physical form and subject to dissolution with it. Though some ofthe Stoics held that wisdom prolonged the existence of the soul, actualimmortality is not included in their tenets. The soul was said to be composed ofeight parts: the five senses, the generative power, the vocal power, and aneighth, or hegemonic, part. Nature was defined as God mixed throughout thesubstance of the world. All things were looked upon as bodies either corporealor incorporeal.Meekness marked the attitude of the Stoic philosopher. While Diogenes wasdelivering a discourse against anger, one of his listeners spat contemptuouslyin his face. Receiving the insult with humility, the great Stoic was moved toretort: “I am not angry, but am in doubt whether I ought to be so or not!”Epicurus of Samos (341-270 B.C.) was the founder of the Epicurean sect, which inmany respects resembles the Cyrenaic but is higher in ethical standards. TheEpicureans also posited pleasure as the most desirable state, but conceived itto be a grave and dignified state achieved through renunciation of those mentaland emotional inconstancies which are productive of pain and sorrow. Epicurusheld that as the pains of the mind and soul are more grievous than those of thebody, so the joys of the mind and soul exceed those of the body. The Cyrenaicsasserted pleasure to be dependent upon action or motion; the Epicureans claimedrest or lack of action to be equally productive of pleasure. Epicurus acceptedthe philosophy of Democritus concerning the nature of atoms and based hisphysics upon this theory. The Epicurean philosophy may be summed up in fourcanons:“(1) Sense is never deceived; and therefore every sensation and every perceptionof an appearance is true. (2) Opinion follows upon sense and is super-added tosensation, and capable of truth or falsehood. (3) All opinion arrested, or notcontradicted by the evidence of sense, is true. (4) An opinion contradicted, ornot arrested by the evidence of sense, is false.” Among the Epicureans of notewere Metrodorus of Lampsacus, Zeno of Sidon, and Phaedrus.Eclecticism may be defined as the practice of choosing apparently irreconcilabledoctrines from antagonistic schools and constructing therefrom a compositephilosophic system in harmony with the convictions of the eclectic himself.Eclecticism can scarcely be considered philosophically or logically sound, foras individual schools arrive at their conclusions by different methods ofreasoning, so the philosophic product of fragments from these schools mustnecessarily be built upon the foundation of conflicting premises. Eclecticism,accordingly, has been designated the layman’s cult. In the Roman Empire littlethought was devoted to philosophic theory; consequently most of its thinkerswere of the eclectic type. Cicero is the outstanding example of earlyEclecticism, for his writings are a veritable potpourri of invaluable fragmentsfrom earlier schools of thought. Eclecticism appears to have had its inceptionat the moment when men first doubted the possibility of discovering ultimatetruth. Observing all so-called knowledge to be mere opinion at best, the lessstudious furthermore concluded that the wiser course to pursue was to acceptthat which appeared to be the most reasonable of the teachings of any school orindividual. From this practice, however, arose a pseudo-broadmindedness devoidof the element of preciseness found in true logic and philosophy.The Neo-Pythagorean school flourished in Alexandria during the first century ofthe Christian Era. Only two names stand out in connection with It—Apollonius ofTyana and Moderatus of Gades. Neo-Pythagoreanism is a link between the olderpagan philosophies and Neo-Platonism. Like the former, it contained many exactelements of thought derived from Pythagoras and Plato; like the latter, itemphasized metaphysical speculation and ascetic habits. A striking similarityhas been observed by several authors between Neo-Pythagoreanism and thedoctrines of the Essenes. Special emphasis was laid upon the mystery of numbers,and it is possible that the Neo-Pythagoreans had a far wider knowledge of thetrue teachings of Pythagoras than is available today. Even in the first centuryPythagoras was regarded more as a god than a man, and the revival of hisphilosophy was resorted to apparently in the hope that his name would stimulateinterest in the deeper systems of learning. But Greek philosophy had passed thezenith of its splendor; the mass of humanity was awakening to the importance ofphysical life and physical phenomena. The emphasis upon earthly affairs whichbegan to assert itself later reached maturity of expression in twentieth centurymaterialism and commercialism, even though Neo- Platonism was to intervene andmany centuries pass before this emphasis took definite form.Although Ammonius Saccus was long believed to be the founder of Neo-Platonism,the school had its true beginning in Plotinus (A.D. 204-269?). Prominent amongthe Neo-Platonists of Alexandria, Syria, Rome, and Athens were Porphyry,Iamblichus, Sallustius, the Emperor Julian, Plutarch, and Proclus. Neo-Platonism was the supreme effort of decadent pagandom to publish and thuspreserve for posterity its secret (or unwritten) doctrine. In its teachingsancient idealism found its most perfect expression. Neo-Platonism was concernedalmost exclusively with the problems of higher metaphysics. It recognized theexistence of a secret and all-important doctrine which from the time of theearliest civilizations had been concealed within the rituals, symbols, andallegories of religions and philosophies. To the mind unacquainted with itsfundamental tenets, Neo-Platonism may appear to be a mass of speculationsinterspersed with extravagant flights of fancy. Such a viewpoint, however,ignores the institutions of the Mysteries—those secret schools into whoseprofundities of idealism nearly all of the first philosophers of antiquity wereinitiated.004 [images/00005.jpg] THE PTOLEMAIC SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE.In ridiculing the geocentric system of astronomy expounded by Claudius Ptolemy,modern astronomers have overlooked the philosophic key to the Ptolemaic system.The universe of Ptolemy is a diagrammatic representation of the relationshipsexisting between the various divine and elemental parts of every creature, andis not concerned with astronomy as that science is now comprehended. In theabove figure, special attention is called to the three circles of zodiacssurrounding the orbits of the planets. These zodiacs represent the threefoldspiritural constitution of the universe. The orbits of the planets are theGovernors of the World and the four elemental spheres in the center representthe physical constitution of both man and the universe. Ptolemy’s scheme of theuniverse is simply a cross section of the universal aura, the planets andelements to which he refers having no relation to those recognized by modernastronomers. When the physical body of pagan thought collapsed, an attempt was made toresurrect the form by instilling new life into it by the unveiling of itsmystical truths. This effort apparently was barren of results. Despite theantagonism, however, between pristine Christianity and Neo-Platonism many basictenets of the latter were accepted by the former and woven into the fabric ofPatristic philosophy. Briefly described, Neo-Platonism is a philosophic codewhich conceives every physical or concrete body of doctrine to be merely theshell of a spiritual verity which may be discovered through meditation andcertain exercises of a mystic nature. In comparison to the esoteric spiritualtruths which they contain, the corporeal bodies of religion and philosophy wereconsidered relatively of little value. Likewise, no emphasis was placed upon thematerial sciences.The term Patristic is employed to designate the philosophy of the Fathers of theearly Christian Church. Patristic philosophy is divided into two general epochs:ante-Nicene and post-Nicene. The ante-Nicene period in the main was devoted toattacks upon paganism and to apologies and defenses of Christianity. The entirestructure of pagan philosophy was assailed and the dictates of faith elevatedabove those of reason. In some instances efforts were made to reconcile theevident truths of paganism with Christian revelation. Eminent among theante-Nicene Fathers were St. Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, and Justin Martyr.In the post-Nicene period more emphasis was placed upon the unfoldment ofChristian philosophy along Platonic and Neo-Platonic lines, resulting in theappearance of many strange documents of a lengthy, rambling, and ambiguousnature, nearly all of which were philosophically unsound. The post-Nicenephilosophers included Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Cyril of Alexandria. ThePatristic school is notable for its emphasis upon the supremacy of manthroughout the universe. Man was conceived to be a separate and divinecreation—the crowning achievement of Deity and an exception to the suzerainty ofnatural law. To the Patristics it was inconceivable that there should ever existanother creature so noble, so fortunate, or so able as man, for whose solebenefit and edification all the kingdoms of Nature were primarily created.Patristic philosophy cluminated in Augustinianism, which may best be defined asChristian Platonism. Opposing the Pelasgian doctrine that man is the author ofhis own salvation, Augustinianism elevated the church and its dogmas to aposition of absolute infallibility—a position which it successfully maintaineduntil the Reformation. Gnosticism, a system of emanationism, interpretingChristianity in terms of Greek, Egyptian, and Persian metaphysics, appeared inthe latter part of the first century of the Christian Era. Practically all theinformation extant regarding the Gnostics and their doctrines, stigmatized asheresy by the ante-Nicene Church Fathers, is derived from the accusations madeagainst them, particularly from the writings of St. Irenæus. In the thirdcentury appeared Manichœism, a dualistic system of Persian origin, which taughtthat Good and Evil were forever contending for universal supremacy. InManichaeism, Christ is conceived to be the Principle of redeeming Good incontradistinction to the man Jesus, who was viewed as an evil personality.The death of Boethius in the sixth century marked the close of the ancient Greekschool of philosophy. The ninth century saw the rise of the new school ofScholasticism, which sought to reconcile philosophy with theology.Representative of the main divisions of the Scholastic school were theEclecticism of John of Salisbury, the Mysticism of Bernard of Clairvaux and St.Bonaventura, the Rationalism of Peter Abelard, and the pantheistic Mysticism ofMeister Eck- hart. Among the Arabian Aristotelians were Avicenna and Averroes.The zenith of Scholasticism was reached with the advent of Albertus Magnus andhis illustrious disciple, St. Thomas Aquinas. Thomism (the philosophy of St.Thomas Aquinas, sometimes referred to as the Christian Aristotle) sought toreconcile the various factions of the Scholastic school. Thomism was basicallyAristotelian with the added concept that faith is a projection of reason.Scotism, or the doctrine of Voluntarism promulgated by Joannes Duns Scotus, aFranciscan Scholastic, emphasized the power and efficacy of the individual will,as opposed to Thomism. The outstanding characteristic of Scholasticism was itsfrantic effort to cast all European thought in an Aristotelian mold. Eventuallythe Schoolmen descended to the level of mere word- mongers who picked the wordsof Aristotle so clean that nothing but the bones remained. It was this decadentschool of meaningless verbiage against which Sir Francis Bacon directed hisbitter shafts of irony and which he relegated to the potter’s field of discardednotions.The Baconian, or inductive, system of reasoning (whereby facts are arrived at bya process of observation and verified by experimentation) cleared the way forthe schools of modern science. Bacon was followed by Thomas Hobbes (for sometime his secretary), who held mathematics to be the only exact science andthought to be essentially a mathematical process. Hobbes declared matter to bethe only reality, and scientific investigation to be limited to the study ofbodies, the phenomena relative to their probable causes, and the consequenceswhich flow from them under every variety of circumstance. Hobbes laid specialstress upon the significance of words, declaring understanding to be the facultyof perceiving the relationship between words and the objects for which theystand.Having broken away from the scholastic and theological schools,Post-Reformation, or modern, philosophy experienced a most prolific growth alongmany diverse lines. According to Humanism, man is the measure of all things;Rationalism makes the reasoning faculties the basis of all knowledge; PoliticalPhilosophy holds that man must comprehend his natural, social, and nationalprivileges; Empiricism declares that alone to be true which is demonstrable byexperiment or experience; Moralism emphasizes the necessity of right conduct asa fundamental philosophic tenet; Idealism asserts the realities of the universeto be superphysical—either mental or psychical; Realism, the reverse; andPhenomenalism restricts knowledge to facts or events which can be scientificallydescribed or explained. The most recent developments in the field of philosophicthought are Behaviorism and Neo-Realism. The former estimates the intrinsiccharacteristics through an analysis of behavior; the latter may be summed up asthe total extinction of idealism.Baruch de Spinoza, the eminent Dutch philosopher, conceived God to be asubstance absolutely self-existent and needing no other conception besidesitself to render it complete and intelligible. The nature of this Being was heldby Spinoza to be comprehensible only through its attributes, which are extensionand thought: these combine to form an endless variety of aspects or modes. Themind of man is one of the modes of infinite thought; the body of man one of themodes of infinite extension. Through reason man is enabled to elevate himselfabove the illusionary world of the senses and find eternal repose in perfectunion with the Divine Essence. Spinoza, it has been said, deprived God of allpersonality, making Deity synonymous with the universe.German philosophy had its inception with Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz, whosetheories are permeated with the qualities of optimism and idealism. Leibnitz’scriteria of sufficient reason revealed to him the insufficiency of Descartes’theory of extension, and he therefore concluded that substance itself containedan inherent power in the form of an incalculable number of separate andall-sufficient units. Matter reduced to its ultimate particles ceases to existas a substantial body, being resolved into a mass of immaterial ideas ormetaphysical units of power, to which Leibnitz applied the term monad. Thus theuniverse is composed of an infinite number of separate monadic entitiesunfolding spontaneously through the objectification of innate active qualities.All things are conceived as consisting of single monads of varying magnitudes orof aggregations of these bodies, which may exist as physical, emotional, mental,or spiritual substances. God is the first and greatest Monad; the spirit of manis an awakened monad in contradistinction to the lower kingdoms whose governingmonadic powers are in a semidormant state.Though a product of the Leibnitzian-Wolfian school, Immanuel Kant, like Locke,dedicated himself to investigation of the powers and limits of humanunderstanding. The result was his critical philosophy, embracing the critique ofpure reason, the critique of practical reason, and the critique of judgment. Dr.W. J. Durant sums up Kant’s philosophy in the concise statement that he rescuedmind from matter. The mind Kant conceived to be the selector and coordinator ofall perceptions, which in turn are the result of sensations grouping themselvesabout some external object. In the classification of sensations and ideas themind employs certain categories: of sense, time and space; of understanding,quality, relation, modality, and causation; and the unity of apperception. Beingsubject to mathematical laws, time and space are considered absolute andsufficient bases for exact thinking. Kant’s practical reason declared that whilethe nature of noumenon could never be comprehended by the reason, the fact ofmorality proves the existence of three necessary postulates: free will,immortality, and God. In the critique of judgment Kant demonstrates the union ofthe noumenon and the phenomenon in art and biological evolution. Germansuperintellectualism is the outgrowth of an overemphasis of Kant’s theory of theautocratic supremacy of the mind over sensation and thought. The philosophy ofJohann Gottlieb Fichte was a projection of Kant’s philosophy, wherein heattempted to unite Kant’s practical reason with his pure reason. Fichte heldthat the known is merely the contents of the consciousness of the knower, andthat nothing can exist to the knower until it becomes part of those contents.Nothing is actually real, therefore, except the facts of one’s own mentalexperience.Recognizing the necessity of certain objective realities, Friedrich WilhelmJoseph von Schelling, who succeeded Fichte in the chair of philosophy at Jena,first employed the doctrine of identity as the groundwork for a complete systemof philosophy. Whereas Fichte regarded self as the Absolute, von Schellingconceived infinite and eternal Mind to be the all-pervading Cause. Realizationof the Absolute is made possible by intellectual intuition which, being asuperior or spiritual sense, is able to dissociate itself from both subject andobject. Kant’s categories of space and time von Schelling conceived to bepositive and negative respectively, and material existence the result of thereciprocal action of these two expressions. Von Schelling also held that theAbsolute in its process of self development proceeds according to a law orrhythm consisting of three movements. The first, a reflective movement, is theattempt of the Infinite to embody itself in the finite. The second, that ofsubsumption, is the attempt of the Absolute to return to the Infinite afterinvolvement in the finite. The third, that of reason, is the neutral pointwherein the two former movements are blended.Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel considered the intellectual intuition of vonSchelling to be philosophically unsound and hence turned his attention to theestablishment of a system of philosophy based upon pure logic. Of Hegel it hasbeen said that he began with nothing and showed with logical precision howeverything had proceeded from it in logical order. Hegel elevated logic to aposition of supreme importance, in fact as a quality of the Absolute itself. Godhe conceived to be a process of unfolding which never attains to the conditionof unfoldment. In like manner, thought is without either beginning or end. Hegelfurther believed that all things owe their existence to their opposites and thatall opposites are actually identical. Thus the only existence is therelationship of opposites to each other, through whose combinations new elementsare produced. As the Divine Mind is an eternal process of thought neveraccomplished, Hegel assails the very foundation of theism and his philosophylimits immortality to the everflowing Deity alone. Evolution is consequently thenever-ending flow of Divine Consciousness out of itself; all creation, thoughcontinually moving, never arrives at any state other than that of ceaselessflow.Johann Friedrich Herbart’s philosophy was a realistic reaction from the idealismof Fichte and von Schelling. To Herbart the true basis of philosophy was thegreat mass of phenomena continually moving through the human mind. Examinationof phenomena, however, demonstrates that a great part of it is unreal, at leastincapable of supplying the mind with actual truth. To correct the falseimpressions caused by phenomena and discover reality, Herbart believed itnecessary to resolve phenomena into separate elements, for reality exists in theelements and not in the whole. He stated that objects can be classified by threegeneral terms: thing, matter, and mind; the first a unit of several properties,the second an existing object, the third a self-conscious being. All threenotions give rise, however, to certain contradictions, with whose solutionHerbart is primarily concerned. For example, consider matter. Though capable offilling space, if reduced to its ultimate state it consists of incomprehensiblyminute units of divine energy occupying no physical space whatsoever.The true subject of Arthur Schopenhauer’s philosophy is the will; the object ofhis philosophy is the elevation of the mind to the point where it is capable ofcontrolling the will. Schopenhauer likens the will to a strong blind man whocarries on his shoulders the intellect, which is a weak lame man possessing thepower of sight. The will is the tireless cause of manifestation and every partof Nature the product of will. The brain is the product of the will to know; thehand the product of the will to grasp. The entire intellectual and emotionalconstitutions of man are subservient to the will and are largely concerned withthe effort to justify the dictates of the will. Thus the mind creates elaboratesystems of thought simply to prove the necessity of the thing willed. Genius,however, represents the state wherein the intellect has gained supremacy overthe will and the life is ruled by reason and not by impulse. The strength ofChristianity, said Schopenhauer, lay in its pessimism and conquest of individualwill. His own religious viewpoints resembled closely the Buddhistic. To himNirvana represented the subjugation of will. Life—the manifestation of the blindwill to live—he viewed as a misfortune, claiming that the true philosopher wasone who, recognizing the wisdom of death, resisted the inherent urge toreproduce his kind.005 [images/00006.jpg] A CHRISTIAN TRINITY.In an effort to set forth in an appropriate figure the Christian doctrine of theTrinity, it was necessary to devise an image in which the three persons—Father,Son, and Holy Ghost—were separate and yet one. In different parts of Europe maybe seen figures similar to the above, wherein three faces are united in onehead. This is a legitimate method of symbolism, for to those able to realize thesacred significance of the threefold head a great mystery is revealed. However,in the presence of such applications of symbology in Christian art, it isscarcely proper to consider the philosophers of other faiths as benighted if,like the Hindus, they have a three-faced Brahma, or, like the Romans, atwo-faced Janus. Of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche it has been said that his peculiar contributionto the cause of human hope was the glad tidings that God had died of pity! Theoutstanding features of Nietzsche’s philosophy are his doctrine of eternalrecurrence and the extreme emphasis placed by him upon the will to power—aprojection of Schopenhauer’s will to live. Nietzsche believed the purpose ofexistence to be the production of a type of all-powerful individual, designatedby him the superman. This superman was the product of careful culturing, for ifnot separated forcibly from the mass and consecrated to the production of power,the individual would sink back to the level of the deadly mediocre. Love,Nietzsche said, should be sacrificed to the production of the superman and thoseonly should marry who are best fitted to produce this outstanding type.Nietzsche also believed in the rule of the aristocracy, both blood and breedingbeing essential to the establishment of this superior type. Nietzsche’s doctrinedid not liberate the masses; it rather placed over them supermen for whom theirinferior brothers and sisters should be perfectly reconciled to die. Ethicallyand politically, the superman was a law unto himself. To those who understandthe true meaning of power to be virtue, self-control, and truth, the idealitybehind Nietzsche’s theory is apparent. To the superficial, however, it is aphilosophy heartless and calculating, concerned solely with the survival of thefittest.Of the other German schools of philosophic thought, limitations of spacepreclude detailed mention. The more recent developments of the German school areFreudianism and Relativism (often called the Einstein theory). The former is asystem of psychoanalysis through psychopathic and neurological phenomena; thelatter attacks the accuracy of mechanical principles dependent upon the presenttheory of velocity.René Descartes stands at the head of the French school of philosophy and shareswith Sir Francis Bacon the honor of founding the systems of modern science andphilosophy. As Bacon based his conclusions upon observation of external things,so Descartes founded his metaphysical philosophy upon observation of internalthings. Cartesianism (the philosophy of Descartes) first eliminates all thingsand then replaces as fundamental those premises without which existence isimpossible. Descartes defined an idea as that which fills the mind when weconceive a thing. The truth of an idea must be determined by the criteria ofclarity and distinctness. Hence Descartes held that a clear and distinct ideamust be true. Descartes has the distinction also of evolving his own philosophywithout recourse to authority. Consequently his conclusions are built up fromthe simplest of premises and grow in complexity as the structure of hisphilosophy takes form.The Positive philosophy of Auguste Comte is based upon the theory that the humanintellect develops through three stages of thought. The first and lowest stageis theological; the second, metaphysical; and the third and highest, positive.Thus theology and metaphysics are the feeble intellectual efforts of humanity’schild-mind and positivism is the mental expression of the adult intellect. Inhis Cours de Philosophie positive, Comte writes:“In the final, the positive state, the mind has given over the vain search afterAbsolute notions, the origin and destination of the universe, and the causes ofphenomena, and applies itself to the study of their laws,—that is, theirinvariable relations of succession and resemblance. Reasoning and observation,duly combined, are the means of this knowledge.” Comte’s theory is described asan “enormous system of materialism.” According to Comte, it was formerly saidthat the heavens declare the glory of God, but now they only recount the gloryof Newton and Laplace.Among the French schools of philosophy are Traditionalism (often applied toChristianity), which esteems tradition as the proper foundation for philosophy;the Sociological school, which regards humanity as one vast social organism; theEncyclopedists, whose efforts to classify knowledge according to the Baconiansystem revolutionized European thought; Voltairism, which assailed the divineorigin of the Christian faith and adopted an attitude of extreme skepticismtowards all matters pertaining to theology; and Neo-Criticism, a French revisionof the doctrines of Immanuel Kant.Henri Bergson, the intuitionalist, undoubtedly the greatest living Frenchphilosopher, presents a theory of mystic anti-intellectualism founded upon thepremise of creative evolution. His rapid rise to popularity is due to his appealto the finer sentiments in human nature, which rebel against the hope- lessnessand helplessness of materialistic science and realistic philosophy. Bergson seesGod as life continually struggling against the limitations of matter. He evenconceives the possible victory of life over matter, and in time the annihilationof death.Applying the Baconian method to the mind, John Locke, the great Englishphilosopher, declared that everything which passes through the mind is alegitimate object of mental philosophy, and that these mental phenomena are asreal and valid as the objects of any other science. In his investigations of theorigin of phenomena Locke departed from the Baconian requirement that it wasfirst necessary to make a natural history of facts. The mind was regarded byLocke to be blank until experience is inscribed upon it. Thus the mind is builtup of received impressions plus reflection. The soul Locke believed to beincapable of apprehension of Deity, and man’s realization or cognition of God tobe merely an inference of the reasoning faculty. David Hume was the mostenthusiastic and also the most powerful of the disciples of Locke.Attacking Locke’s sensationalism, Bishop George Berkeley substituted for it aphilosophy founded on Locke’s fundamental premises but which he developed as asystem of idealism. Berkeley held that ideas are the real objects of knowledge.He declared it impossible to adduce proof that sensations are occasioned bymaterial objects; he also attempted to prove that matter has no existence.Berkeleianism holds that the universe is permeated and governed by mind. Thusthe belief in the existence of material objects is merely a mental condition,and the objects themselves may well be fabrications of the mind. At the sametime Berkeley considered it worse than insanity to question the accuracy of theperceptions; for if the power of the perceptive faculties be questioned man isreduced to a creature incapable of knowing, estimating, or realizing anythingwhatsoever.In the Associationalism of Hartley and Hume was advanced the theory that theassociation of ideas is the fundamental principle of psychology and theexplanation for all mental phenomena. Hartley held that if a sensation berepeated several times there is a tendency towards its spontaneous repetition,which may be awakened by association with some other idea even though the objectcausing the original reaction be absent. The Utilitarianism of Jeremy Ben- tham,Archdeacon Paley, and James and John Stuart Mill declares that to be thegreatest good which is the most useful to the greatest number. John Stuart Millbelieved that if it is possible through sensation to secure knowledge of theproperties of things, it is also possible through a higher state of themind—that is, intuition or reason—to gain a knowledge of the true substance ofthings.Darwinism is the doctrine of natural selection and physical evolution. It hasbeen said of Charles Robert Darwin that he determined to banish spiritaltogether from the universe and make the infinite and omnipresent Mind itselfsynonymous with the all-pervading powers of an impersonal Nature. Agnosticismand Neo-Hegelianism are also noteworthy products of this period of philosophicthought. The former is the belief that the nature of ultimates is unknowable;the latter an English and American revival of Hegel’s idealism.Dr. W.J. Durant declares that Herbert Spencer’s great work, First Principles,made him almost at once the most famous philosopher of his time. Spencerianismis a philosophic positivism which describes evolution as an ever-increasingcomplexity with equilibrium as its highest possible state. According to Spencer,life is a continuous process from homogeneity to heterogeneity and back fromheterogeneity to homogeneity. Life also involves the continual adjustment ofinternal relations to external relations. Most famous of all Spencer’s aphorismsis his definition of Deity: “God is infinite intelligence, infinitelydiversified through infinite time and infinite space, manifesting through aninfinitude of ever-evolving individualities.” The universality of the law ofevolution was emphasized by Spencer, who applied it not only to the form butalso to the intelligence behind the form. In every manifestation of being herecognized the fundamental tendency of unfoldment from simplicity to complexity,observing that when the point of equilibrium is reached it is always followed bythe process of dissolution. According to Spencer, however, disintegration tookplace only that reintegration might follow upon a higher level of being.The chief position in the Italian school of philosophy should be awarded toGiordano Bruno, who, after enthusiastically accepting Copernicus’ theory thatthe sun is the center of the solar system, declared the sun to be a star and allthe stars to be suns. In Bruno’s time the earth was regarded as the center ofall creation. Consequently when he thus relegated the world and man to anobscure corner in space the effect was cataclysmic. For the heresy of affirminga multiplicity of universes and conceiving Cosmos to be so vast that no singlecreed could fill it, Bruno paid the forfeit of his life.Vicoism is a philosophy based upon the conclusions of Giovanni Battista Vico,who held that God controls His world not miraculously but through natural law.The laws by which men rule themselves, Vico declared, issue from a spiritualsource within mankind which is en rapport with the law of the Deity. Hencematerial law is of divine origin and reflects the dictates of the SpiritualFather. The philosophy of Ontologism developed by Vincenzo Gioberti (generallyconsidered more as a theologian than a philosopher) posits God as the only beingand the origin of all knowledge, knowledge being identical with Deity itself.God is consequently called Being; all other manifestations are existences. Truthis to be discovered through reflection upon this mystery.The most important of modern Italian philosophers is Benedetto Croce, a Hegelianidealist. Croce conceives ideas to be the only reality. He is anti-theologicalin his viewpoints, does not believe in the immortality of the soul, and seeks tosubstitute ethics and aesthetics for religion. Among other branches of Italianphilosophy should be mentioned Sensism (Sensationalism), which posits the senseperceptions as the sole channels for the reception of knowledge; Criticism, orthe philosophy of accurate judgment; and Neo-Scholasticism, which is a revivalof Thomism encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church.The two outstanding schools of American philosophy are Transcendentalism andPragmatism. Transcendentalism, exemplified in the writings of Ralph WaldoEmerson, emphasizes the power of the transcendental over the physical. Many ofEmerson’s writings show pronounced Oriental influence, particularly his essayson the Oversoul and the Law of Compensation. The theory of Pragmatism, while notoriginal with Professor William James, owes its widespread popularity as aphilosophic tenet to his efforts. Pragmatism may be defined as the doctrine thatthe meaning and nature of things are to be discovered from consideration oftheir consequences. The true, according to James, “is only an expedient in theway of our thinking, just as ‘the right’ is only an expedient in the way of ourbehaving.” (See his Pragmatism.) John Dewey, the Instrumentalist, who appliesthe experimental attitude to all the aims of life, should be considered acommentator of James. To Dewey, growth and change are limitless and no ultimatesare postulated. The long residence in America of George Santayana warrants thelisting of this great Spaniard among the ranks of American philosophers.Defending himself with the shield of skepticism alike from the illusions of thesenses and the cumulative errors of the ages, Santayana seeks to lead mankindinto a more apprehending state denominated by him the life of reason.(In addition to the authorities already quoted, in the preparation of theforegoing abstract of the main branches of philosophic thought the presentwriter has had recourse to Stanley’s History of Philosophy; Morell’s AnHistorical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe in theNineteenth Century; Singer’s Modern Thinkers and Present Problems; Rand’s ModernClassical Philosophers; Windelband’s History of Philosophy; Perry’s PresentPhilosophical Tendencies; Hamilton’s Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic; andDurant’s The Story of Philosophy.)Having thus traced the more or less sequential development of philosophicspeculation from Thales to James and Bergson, it is now in order to direct thereader’s attention to the elements leading to and the circumstances attendantupon the genesis of philosophic thinking. Although the Hellenes provedthemselves peculiarly responsive to the disciplines of philosophy, this scienceof sciences should not be considered indigenous to them. “Although some of theGrecians,” writes Thomas Stanley, “have challenged to their nation the originalof philosophy, yet the more learned of them have acknowledged it [to be] derivedfrom the East.” The magnificent institutions of Hindu, Chaldean, and Egyptianlearning must be recognized as the actual source of Greek wisdom. The last waspatterned after the shadow cast by the sanctuaries of Ellora, Ur, and Memphisupon the thought substance of a primitive people. Thales, Pythagoras, and Platoin their philosophic wanderings contacted many distant cults and brought backthe lore of Egypt and the inscrutable Orient.From indisputable facts such as these it is evident that philosophy emerged fromthe religious Mysteries of antiquity, not being separated from religion untilafter the decay of the Mysteries. Hence he who would fathom the depths ofphilosophic thought must familiarize himself with the teachings of thoseinitiated priests designated as the first custodians of divine revelation. TheMysteries claimed to be the guardians of a transcendental knowledge so profoundas to be incomprehensible save to the most exalted intellect and so potent as tobe revealed with safety only to those in whom personal ambition was dead and whohad consecrated their lives to the unselfish service of humanity. Both thedignity of these sacred institutions and the validity of their claim topossession of Universal Wisdom are attested by the most illustrious philosophersof antiquity, who were themselves initiated into the profundities of the secretdoctrine and who bore witness to its efficacy.The question may legitimately be propounded: If these ancient mysticalinstitutions were of such “great pith and moment,” why is so little informationnow available concerning them and the arcana they claimed to possess? The answeris simple enough: The Mysteries were secret societies, binding their initiatesto inviolable secrecy, and avenging with death the betrayal of their sacredtrusts. Although these schools were the true inspiration of the variousdoctrines promulgated by the ancient philosophers, the fountainhead of thosedoctrines was never revealed to the profane. Furthermore, in the lapse of timethe teachings became so inextricably linked with the names of theirdisseminators that the actual but recondite source—the Mysteries—came to bewholly ignored.Symbolism is the language of the Mysteries; in fact it is the language not onlyof mysticism and philosophy but of all Nature, for every law and power active inuniversal procedure is manifested to the limited sense perceptions of manthrough the medium of symbol. Every form existing in the diversified sphere ofbeing is symbolic of the divine activity by which it is produced. By symbols menhave ever sought to communicate to each other those thoughts which transcend thelimitations of language. Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate andunworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a farmore ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. Ina single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, for to the wise thesubject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remainsinscrutable. Hence, he who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity mustsearch for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall intothe hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed.Far-sighted were the initiates of antiquity. They realized that nations come andgo, that empires rise and fall, and that the golden ages of art, science, andidealism are succeeded by the dark ages of superstition. With the needs ofposterity foremost in mind, the sages of old went to inconceivable extremes tomake certain that their knowledge should be preserved. They engraved it upon theface of mountains and concealed it within the measurements of colossal images,each of which was a geometric marvel. Their knowledge of chemistry andmathematics they hid within mythologies which the ignorant would perpetuate, orin the spans and arches of their temples which time has not entirelyobliterated. They wrote in characters that neither the vandalism of men nor theruthlessness of the elements could completely efface. Today men gaze with aweand reverence upon the mighty Memnons standing alone on the sands of Egypt, orupon the strange terraced pyramids of Palanque. Mute testimonies these are ofthe lost arts and sciences of antiquity; and concealed this wisdom must remainuntil this race has learned to read the universal language—SYMBOLISM.The book to which this is the introduction is dedicated to the proposition thatconcealed within the emblematic figures, allegories, and rituals of the ancientsis a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of life, which doctrine hasbeen preserved in toto among a small band of initiated minds since the beginningof the world. Departing, these illumined philosophers left their formulae thatothers, too, might attain to understanding. But, lest these secret processesfall into uncultured hands and be perverted, the Great Arcanum was alwaysconcealed in symbol or allegory; and those who can today discover its lost keysmay open with them a treasure house of philosophic, scientific, and religioustruths."},{"pageContent":"II The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies Which Have Influenced Modern MasonicSymbolism PART I Then confronted with a problem involving the use of the reasoning faculties,individuals of strong intellect keep their poise, and seek to reach a solutionby obtaining facts bearing upon the question. Those of immature mentality, onthe other hand, when similarly confronted, are overwhelmed. While the former maybe qualified to solve the riddle of their own destiny, the latter must be ledlike a flock of sheep and taught in simple language. They depend almost entirelyupon the ministrations of the shepherd. The Apostle Paul said that these littleones must be fed with milk, but that meat is the food of strong men.Thoughtlessness is almost synonymous with childishness, while thoughtfulness issymbolic of maturity.There are, however, but few mature minds in the world; and thus it was that thephilosophic-religious doctrines of the pagans were divided to meet the needs ofthese two fundamental groups of human intellect—one philosophic, the otherincapable of appreciating the deeper mysteries of life. To the discerning fewwere revealed the esoteric, or spiritual, teachings, while the unqualified manyreceived only the literal, or exoteric, interpretations. In order to make simplethe great truths of Nature and the abstract principles of natural law, the vitalforces of the universe were personified, becoming the gods and goddesses of theancient mythologies. While the ignorant multitudes brought their offerings tothe altars of Priapus and Pan (deities representing the procreative energies),the wise recognized in these marble statues only symbolic concretions of greatabstract truths.In all cities of the ancient world were temples for public worship and offering.In every community also were philosophers and mystics, deeply versed in Nature’slore. These individuals were usually banded together, forming seclu- sivephilosophic and religious schools. The more important of these groups were knownas the Mysteries. Many of the great minds of antiquity were initiated into thesesecret fraternities by strange and mysterious rites, some of which wereextremely cruel. Alexander Wilder defines the Mysteries as “Sacred dramasperformed at stated periods. The most celebrated were those of Isis, Sabazius,Cybele, and Eleusis.” After being admitted, the initiates were instructed in thesecret wisdom which had been preserved for ages. Plato, an initiate of one ofthese sacred orders, was severely criticized because in his writings he revealedto the public many of the secret philosophic principles of the Mysteries.Every pagan nation had (and has) not only its state religion, but another intowhich the philosophic elect alone have gained entrance. Many of these ancientcults vanished from the earth without revealing their secrets, but a few havesurvived the test of ages and their mysterious symbols are still preserved. Muchof the ritualism of Freemasonry is based on the trials to which candidates weresubjected by the ancient hierophants before the keys of wisdom were entrusted tothem.Few realize the extent to which the ancient secret schools influencedcontemporary intellects and, through those minds, posterity. Robert Macoy, 33°,in his General History of Freemasonry, pays a magnificent tribute to the partplayed by the ancient Mysteries in the rearing of the edifice of human culture.He says, in part: “It appears that all the perfection of civilization, and allthe advancement made in philosophy, science, and art among the ancients are dueto those institutions which, under the veil of mystery, sought to illustrate thesublimest truths of religion, morality, and virtue, and impress them on thehearts of their disciples.* * * Their chief object was to teach the doctrine ofone God, the resurrection of man to eternal life, the dignity of the human soul,and to lead the people to see the shadow of the deity, in the beauty,magnificence, and splendor of the universe.”With the decline of virtue, which has preceded the destruction of every nationof history, the Mysteries became perverted. Sorcery took the place of the divinemagic. Indescribable practices (such as the Bacchanalia) were introduced, andperversion ruled supreme; for no institution can be any better than the membersof which it is composed. In despair, the few who were true sought to preservethe secret doctrines from oblivion. In some cases they succeeded, but more oftenthe arcanum was lost and only the empty shell of the Mysteries remained.Thomas Taylor has written, “Man is naturally a religious animal.” From theearliest dawning of his consciousness, man has worshiped and revered things assymbolic of the invisible, omnipresent, indescribable Thing, concerning which hecould discover practically nothing. The pagan Mysteries opposed the Christiansduring the early centuries of their church, declaring that the new faith(Christianity) did not demand virtue and integrity as requisites for salvation.Celsus expressed himself on the subject in the following caustic terms:“That I do not, however, accuse the Christians more bitterly than truth compels,may be conjectured from hence, that the cryers who call men to other mysteriesproclaim as follows: ‘Let him approach whose hands are pure, and whose words arewise.’ And again, others proclaim: ‘Let him approach who is pure from allwickedness, whose soul is not conscious of any evil, and who leads a just andupright life.’ And these things are proclaimed by those who promise apurification from error. Let us now hear who those are that are called to theChristian mysteries: Whoever is a sinner, whoever is unwise, whoever is a fool,and whoever, in short, is miserable, him the kingdom of God will receive. Do younot, therefore, call a sinner, an unjust man, a thief, a housebreaker, a wizard,one who is sacrilegious, and a robber of sepulchres? What other persons wouldthe cryer nominate, who should call robbers together?”It was not the true faith of the early Christian mystics that Celsus attacked,but the false forms that were creeping in even during his day. The ideals ofearly Christianity were based upon the high moral standards of the paganMysteries, and the first Christians who met under the city of Rome used as theirplaces of worship the subterranean temples of Mithras, from whose cult has beenborrowed much of the sacerdotalism of the modern church.The ancient philosophers believed that no man could live intelligently who didnot have a fundamental knowledge of Nature and her laws. Before man can obey, hemust understand, and the Mysteries were devoted to instructing man concerningthe operation of divine law in the terrestrial sphere. Few of the early cultsactually worshiped anthropomorphic deities, although their symbolism might leadone to believe they did. They were moralistic rather than religionistic;philosophic rather than theologic. They taught man to use his faculties moreintelligently, to be patient in the face of adversity, to be courageous whenconfronted by danger, to be true in the midst of temptation, and, most of all,to view a worthy life as the most acceptable sacrifice to God, and his body asan altar sacred to the Deity.Sun worship played an important part in nearly all the early pagan Mysteries.This indicates the probability of their Atlantean origin, for the people ofAtlantis were sun worshipers. The Solar Deity was usually personified as abeautiful youth, with long golden hair to symbolize the rays of the sun. Thisgolden Sun God was slain by wicked ruffians, who personified the evil principleof the universe. By means of certain rituals and ceremonies, symbolic ofpurification and regeneration, this wonderful God of Good was brought back tolife and became the Savior of His people. The secret processes whereby He wasresurrected symbolized those cultures by means of which man is able to overcomehis lower nature, master his appetites, and give expression to the higher sideof himself. The Mysteries were organized for the purpose of assisting thestruggling human creature to reawaken the spiritual powers which, surrounded bythe flaming ring of lust and degeneracy, lay asleep within his soul. In otherwords, man was offered a way by which he could regain his lost estate. (SeeWagner’s Siegfried.)In the ancient world, nearly all the secret societies were philosophic andreligious. During the mediaeval centuries, they were chiefly religious andpolitical, although a few philosophic schools remained. In modern times, secretsocieties, in the Occidental countries, are largely political or fraternal,although in a few of them, as in Masonry, the ancient religious and philosophicprinciples still survive.Space prohibits a detailed discussion of the secret schools. There wereliterally scores of these ancient cults, with branches in all parts of theEastern and Western worlds. Some, such as those of Pythagoras and theHermetists, show a decided Oriental influence, while the Rosicrucians, accordingto their own proclamations, gained much of their wisdom from Arabian mystics.Although the Mystery schools are usually associated with civilization, there isevidence that the most uncivilized peoples of prehistoric times had a knowledgeof them. Natives of distant islands, many in the lowest forms of savagery, havemystic rituals and secret practices which, although primitive, are of a decidedMasonic tinge."},{"pageContent":"THE DRUIDIC MYSTERIES OF BRITAIN AND GAUL “The original and primitive inhabitants of Britain, at some remote period,revived and reformed their national institutes. Their priest, or instructor, hadhithero been simply named Gwydd, but it was considered to have become necessaryto divide this office between the national, or superior, priest and anotherwhose influence [would] be more limited. From henceforth the former becameDer-Wydd (Druid), or superior instructor, and [the latter] Go-Wydd, or O-Vydd(Ovate), subordinate instructor; and both went by the general name of Beirdd(Bards), or teachers of wisdom. As the system matured and augmented, the BardicOrder consisted of three classes, the Druids, Beirdd Braint, or privilegedBards, and Ovates.” (See Samuel Meyrick and Charles Smith, The Costume of TheOriginal Inhabitants of The British Islands.)The origin of the word Druid is under dispute. Max Müller believes that, likethe Irish word Drui, it means “the men of the oak trees.” He further drawsattention to the fact that the forest gods and tree deities of the Greeks werecalled dryades. Some believe the word to be of Teutonic origin; others ascribeit to the Welsh. A few trace it to the Gaelic druidh, which means “a wise man”or “a sorcerer.” In Sanskrit the word dru means “timber.”At the time of the Roman conquest, the Druids were thoroughly ensconced inBritain and Gaul. Their power over the people was unquestioned, and there wereinstances in which armies, about to attack each other, sheathed their swordswhen ordered to do so by the white-robed Druids. No undertaking of greatimportance was started without the assistance of these patriarchs, who stood asmediators between the gods and men. The Druidic Order is deservedly creditedwith having had a deep understanding of Nature and her laws. The EncyclopœdiaBritannica states that geography, physical science, natural theology, andastrology were their favorite studies. The Druids had a fundamental knowledge ofmedicine, especially the use of herbs and simples. Crude surgical instrumentsalso have been found in England and Ireland. An odd treatise on early Britishmedicine states that every practitioner was expected to have a garden or backyard for the growing of certain herbs necessary to his profession. Eliphas Levi,the celebrated transcendentalist, makes the following significant statement:“The Druids were priests and physicians, curing by magnetism and chargingamylets with their fluidic influence. Their universal remedies were mistletoeand serpents’ eggs, because these substances attract the astral light in aspecial manner. The solemnity with which mistletoe was cut down drew upon thisplant the popular confidence and rendered it powerfully magnetic.* * * Theprogress of magnetism will some day reveal to us the absorbing properties ofmistletoe. We shall then understand the secret of those spongy growths whichdrew the unused virtues of plants and become surcharged with tinctures andsavors. Mushrooms, truffles, gall on trees, and the different kinds of mistletoewill be employed with understanding by a medical science, which will be newbecause it is old * * * but one must not move quicker than science, whichrecedes that it may advance the further.” (See The History of Magic.)Not only was the mistletoe sacred as symbolic of the universal medicine, orpanacea, but also because of the fact that it grew upon the oak tree. Throughthe symbol of the oak, the Druids worshiped the Supreme Deity; therefore,anything growing upon that tree was sacred to Him. At certain seasons, accordingto the positions of the sun, moon, and stars, the Arch-Druid climbed the oaktree and cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle consecrated for that service.The parasitic growth was caught in white cloths provided for the purpose, lestit touch the earth and be polluted by terrestrial vibrations. Usually asacrifice of a white bull was made under the tree.The Druids were initiates of a secret school that existed in their midst. Thisschool, which closely resembled the Bacchic and Eleusinian Mysteries of Greeceor the Egyptian rites of Isis and Osiris, is justly designated the DruidicMysteries. There has been much speculation concerning the secret wisdom that theDruids claimed to possess. Their secret teachings were never written, but werecommunicated orally to specially prepared candidates. Robert Brown, 32°, is ofthe opinion that the British priests secured their information from Tyrian andPhœnician navigators who, thousands of years before the Christian Era,established colonies in Britain and Gaul while searching for tin. ThomasMaurice, in his Indian Antiquities, discourses at length on Phœnician,Carthaginian, and Greek expeditions to the British Isles for the purpose ofprocuring tin. Others are of the opinion that the Mysteries as celebrated by theDruids were of Oriental origin, possibly Buddhistic.The proximity of the British Isles to the lost Atlantis may account for the sunworship which plays an important part in the rituals of Druidism. According toArtemidorus, Ceres and Persephone were worshiped on an island close to Britainwith rites and ceremonies similar to those of Samothrace. There is no doubt thatthe Druidic Pantheon includes a large number of Greek and Roman deities. Thisgreatly amazed Cæsar during his conquest of Britain and Gaul, and caused him toaffirm that these tribes adored Mercury, Apollo, Mars, and Jupiter, in a mannersimilar to that of the Latin countries. It is almost certain that the DruidicMysteries were not indigenous to Britain or Gaul, but migrated from one of themore ancient civilizations.The school of the Druids was divided into three distinct parts, and the secretteachings embodied therein are practically the same as the mysteries concealedunder the allegories of Blue Lodge Masonry. The lowest of the three divisionswas that of Ovate (Ovydd). This was an honorary degree, requiring no specialpurification or preparation. The Ovates dressed in green, the Druidic color oflearning, and were expected to know something about medicine, astronomy, poetryif possible, and sometimes music. An Ovate was an individual admitted to theDruidic Order because of his general excellence and superior knowledgeconcerning the problems of life.The second division was that of Bard (Beirdd). Its members were robed insky-blue, to represent harmony and truth, and to them was assigned the labor ofmemorizing, at least in part, the twenty thousand verses of Druidic sacredpoetry. They were often pictured with the primitive British or Irish harp—aninstrument strung with human hair, and having as many strings as there were ribson one side of the human body. These Bards were often chosen as teachers ofcandidates seeking entrance into the Druidic Mysteries. Neophytes wore stripedrobes of blue, green, and white, these being the three sacred colors of theDruidic Order.The third division was that of Druid (Derwyddon). Its particular labor was tominister to the religious needs of the people. To reach this dignity, thecandidate must first become a Bard Braint. The Druids always dressed inwhite—symbolic of their purity, and the color used by them to symbolize the sun.In order to reach the exalted position of Arch-Druid, or spiritual head of theorganization, it was necessary for a priest to pass through the six successivedegrees of the Druidic Order. (The members of the different degrees weredifferentiated by the colors of their sashes, for all of them wore robes ofwhite.) Some writers are of the opinion that the title of Arch-Druid washereditary, descending from father to son, but it is more probable that thehonor was conferred by ballot election. Its recipient was chosen for his virtuesand integrity from the most learned members of the higher Druidic degrees.According to James Gardner, there were usually two Arch-Druids in Britain, oneresiding on the Isle of Anglesea and the other on the Isle of Man. Presumablythere were others in Gaul. These dignitaries generally carried golden sceptersand were crowned with wreaths of oak leaves, symbolic of their authority. Theyounger members of the Druidic Order were clean-shaven and modestly dressed, butthe more aged had long gray beards and wore magnificent golden ornaments. Theeducational system of the Druids in Britain was superior to that of theircolleagues on the Continent, and consequently many of the Gallic youths weresent to the Druidic colleges in Britain for their philosophical instruction andtraining.Eliphas Levi states that the Druids lived in strict abstinence, studied thenatural sciences, preserved the deepest secrecy, and admitted new members onlyafter long probationary periods. Many of the priests of the order lived inbuildings not unlike the monasteries of the modern world. They were associatedin groups like ascetics of the Far East. Although celibacy was not demanded ofthem, few married. Many of the Druids retired from the world and lived asrecluses in caves, in rough-stone houses, or in little shacks built in thedepths of a forest. Here they prayed and meditated, emerging only to performtheir religious duties.006 [images/00007.jpg] THE GROUND PLAN OF STONEHENGE.The Druid temples or places of religious worship were not patterned after thoseof other nations. Most of their ceremonies were performed at night, either inthick groves of oak trees or around open-air altars built of great uncut stones.How these masses of rock were moved has not been satisfactorily explained. Themost famous of their altars, a great ring of rocks, is Stonehenge, inSouthwestern England. This structure, laid out on an astronomical basis, stillstands, a wonder of antiquity. James Freeman Clarke, in his Ten Great Religions, describes the beliefs of theDruids as follows: “The Druids believed in three worlds and in transmigrationfrom one to the other: In a world above this, in which happiness predominated; aworld below, of misery; and this present state. This transmigration was topunish and reward and also to purify the soul. In the present world, said they,Good and Evil are so exactly balanced that man has the utmost freedom and isable to choose or reject either. The Welsh Triads tell us there are threeobjects of metempsychosis: to collect into the soul the properties of all being,to acquire a knowledge of all things, and to get power to conquer evil. Thereare also, they say, three kinds of knowledge: knowledge of the name of eachthing, of its cause, and its influence. There are three things which continuallygrow less: darkness, falsehood, and death. There are three which constantlyincrease: light, life, and truth.”Like nearly all schools of the Mysteries, the teachings of the Druids weredivided into two distinct sections. The simpler, a moral code, was taught to allthe people, while the deeper, esoteric doctrine was given only to initiatedpriests. To be admitted to the order, a candidate was required to be of goodfamily and of high moral character. No important secrets were intrusted to himuntil he had been tempted in many ways and his strength of character severelytried. The Druids taught the people of Britain and Gaul concerning theimmortality of the soul. They believed in transmigration and apparently inreincarnation. They borrowed in one life, promising to pay back in the next.They believed in a purgatorial type of hell where they would be purged of theirsins, afterward passing on to the happiness of unity with the gods. The Druidstaught that all men would be saved, but that some must return to earth manytimes to learn the lessons of human life and to overcome the inherent evil oftheir own natures.Before a candidate was intrusted with the secret doctrines of the Druids, he wasbound with a vow of secrecy. These doctrines were imparted only in the depths offorests and in the darkness of caves. In these places, far from the haunts ofmen, the neophyte was instructed concerning the creation of the universe, thepersonalities of the gods, the laws of Nature, the secrets of occult medicine,the mysteries of the celestial bodies, and the rudiments of magic and sorcery.The Druids had a great number of feast days. The new and full moon and the sixthday of the moon were sacred periods. It is believed that initiations took placeonly at the two solstices and the two equinoxes. At dawn of the 25th day ofDecember, the birth of the Sun God was celebrated.The secret teachings of the Druids are said by some to be tinctured withPythagorean philosophy. The Druids had a Madonna, or Virgin Mother, with a Childin her arms, who was sacred to their Mysteries; and their Sun God wasresurrected at the time of the year corresponding to that at which modernChristians celebrate Easter.Both the cross and the serpent were sacred to the Druids, who made the former bycutting off all the branches of an oak tree and fastening one of them to themain trunk in the form of the letter T. This oaken cross became symbolic oftheir superior Deity. They also worshiped the sun, moon, and stars. The moonreceived their special veneration. Cæsar stated that Mercury was one of thechief deities of the Gauls. The Druids are believed to have worshiped Mercuryunder the similitude of a stone cube. They also had great veneration for theNature spirits (fairies, gnomes, and undines), little creatures of the forestsand rivers to whom many offerings were made. Describing the temples of theDruids, Charles Heckethorn, in The Secret Societies of All Ages & Countries,says:“Their temples wherein the sacred fire was preserved were generally situate oneminences and in dense groves of oak, and assumed various forms—circular,because a circle was the emblem of the universe; oval, in allusion to themundane egg, from which issued, according to the traditions of many nations, theuniverse, or, according to others, our first parents; serpentine, because aserpent was the symbol of Hu, the Druidic Osiris; cruciform, because a cross isan emblem of regeneration; or winged, to represent the motion of the DivineSpirit. * * * Their chief deities were reducible to two—a male and a female, thegreat father and mother—Hu and Ceridwen, distinguished by the samecharacteristics as belong to Osiris and Isis, Bacchus and Ceres, or any othersupreme god and goddess representing the two principles of all Being.”Godfrey Higgins states that Hu, the Mighty, regarded as the first settler ofBritain, came from a place which the Welsh Triads call the Summer Country, thepresent site of Constantinople. Albert Pike says that the Lost Word of Masonryis concealed in the name of the Druid god Hu. The meager information extantconcerning the secret initiations of the Druids indicates a decided similaritybetween their Mystery school and the schools of Greece and Egypt. Hu, the SunGod, was murdered and, after a number of strange ordeals and mystic rituals, wasrestored to life.There were three degrees of the Druidic Mysteries, but few successfully passedthem all. The candidate was buried in a coffin, as symbolic of the death of theSun God. The supreme test, however, was being sent out to sea in an open boat.While undergoing this ordeal, many lost their lives. Taliesin, an ancientscholar, who passed through the Mysteries, describes the initiation of the openboat in Faber’s Pagan Idolatry. The few who passed this third degree were saidto have been “born again,” and were instructed in the secret and hidden truthswhich the Druid priests had preserved from antiquity. From these initiates werechosen many of the dignitaries of the British religious and political world.(For further details, see Faber’s Pagan Idolatry, Albert Pike’s Morals andDogma, and Godfrey Higgins’ Celtic Druids.)"},{"pageContent":"THE RITES OF MITHRAS When the Persian Mysteries immigrated into Southern Europe, they were quicklyassimilated by the Latin mind. The cult grew rapidly, especially among the Romansoldiery, and during the Roman wars of conquest the teachings were carried bythe legionaries to nearly all parts of Europe. So powerful did the cult ofMithras become that at least one Roman Emperor was initiated into the order,which met in caverns under the city of Rome. Concerning the spread of thisMystery school through different parts of Europe, C. W. King, in his Gnosticsand Their Remains, says:“Mithraic bas-reliefs cut on the faces of rocks or on stone tablets still aboundin the countries formerly the western provinces of the Roman Empire; many existin Germany, still more in France, and in this island (Britain) they have oftenbeen discovered on the line of the Picts’ Wall and the noted one at Bath.”Alexander Wilder, in his Philosophy and Ethics of the Zoroasters, states thatMithras is the Zend title for the sun, and he is supposed to dwell within thatshining orb. Mithras has a male and a female aspect, though not himselfandrogynous. As Mitlaras, he is the lord of the sun, powerful and radiant, andmost magnificent of the Yazatas (Izads, or Genii, of the sun). As Mithra, thisdeity represents the feminine principle; the mundane universe is recognized asher symbol. She represents Nature as receptive and terrestrial, and as fruitfulonly when bathed in the glory of the solar orb. The Mithraic cult is asimplication of the more elaborate teachings of Zarathustra (Zoroaster), thePersian fire magician.007 [images/00008.jpg] MITHRAS SLAYING THE BULL.The most famous sculpturings and reliefs of this prototokos show Mithraskneeling upon the recumbent form of a great bull, into whose throat he isdriving a sword. The slaying of the bull signifies that the rays of the sun,symbolized by the sword, release at the vernal equinox the vital essences of theearth—the blood of the bull—which, pouring from the wound made by the Sun God,fertilize the seeds of living things. Dogs were held sacred to the cult ofMithras, being symbolic of sincerity and trustworthiness. The Mithraics used theserpent as an emblem of Ahriman, the Spirit of Evil, and water rats were heldsacred to him. The bull is esoterically the Constellation of Taurus; theserpent, its opposite in the zodiac, Scorpio; the sun, Mithras, entering intothe side of the bull stays the celestial creature and nourishes the universewith its blood. According to the Persians, there coexisted in eternity two principles. The firstof these, Ahura-Mazda , or Ormuzd, was the Spirit of Good. From Ormuzd cameforth a number of hierarchies of good and beautiful spirits (angels andarchangels). The second of these eternally existing principles was calledAhriman. He was also a pure and beautiful spirit, but he later rebelled againstOrmuzd, being jealous of his power. This did not occur, however, until afterOrmuzd had created light, for previously Ahriman had not been conscious of theexistence of Ormuzd. Because of his jealousy and rebellion, Ahriman became theSpirit of Evil. From himself he individualized a host of destructive creaturesto injure Ormuzd.When Ormuzd created the earth, Ahriman entered into its grosser elements.Whenever Ormuzd did a good deed, Ahriman placed the principle of evil within it.At last when Ormuzd created the human race, Ahriman became incarnate in thelower nature of man so that in each personality the Spirit of Good and theSpirit of Evil struggle for control. For 3,000 years Ormuzd ruled the celestialworlds with light and goodness. Then he created man. For another 3,000 years heruled man with wisdom and integrity. Then the power of Ahriman began, and thestruggle for the soul of man continues through the next period of 3,000 years.During the fourth period of 3,000 years, the power of Ahriman will be destroyed.Good will return to the world again, evil and death will be vanquished, and atlast the Spirit of Evil will bow humbly before the throne of Ormuzd. WhileOrmuzd and Ahriman are struggling for control of the human soul and forsupremacy in Nature, Mithras, God of Intelligence, stands as mediator betweenthe two. Many authors have noted the similarity between mercury and Mithras. Asthe chemical mercury acts as a solvent (according to alchemists), so Mithrasseeks to harmonize the two celestial opposites.There are many points of resemblance between Christianity and the cult ofMithras. One of the reasons for this probably is that the Persian mysticsinvaded Italy during the first century after Christ and the early history ofboth cults was closely interwoven. The Encyclopædia Britannica makes thefollowing statement concerning the Mithraic and Christian Mysteries:“The fraternal and democratic spirit of the first communities, and their humbleorigin; the identification of the object of adoration with light and the sun;the legends of the shepherds with their gifts and adoration, the flood, and theark; the representation in art of the fiery chariot, the drawing of water fromthe rock; the use of bell and candle, holy water and the communion; thesanctification of Sunday and of the 25th of December; the insistence on moralconduct, the emphasis placed on abstinence and self-control; the doctrine ofheaven and hell, of primitive revelation, of the mediation of the Logosemanating from the divine, the atoning sacrifice, the constant warfare betweengood and evil and the final triumph of the former, the immortality of the soul,the last judgment, the resurrection of the flesh and the fiery destruction ofthe universe—[these] are some of the resemblances which, whether real or onlyapparent, enabled Mithraism to prolong its resistance to Christianity.”The rites of Mithras were performed in caves. Porphyry, in his Cave of theNymphs, states that Zarathustra (Zoroaster) was the first to consecrate a caveto the worship of God, because a cavern was symbolic of the earth, or the lowerworld of darkness. John P. Lundy, in his Monumental Christianity, describes thecave of Mithras as follows:“But this cave was adorned with the signs of the zodiac, Cancer and Capricorn.The summer and winter solstices were chiefly conspicuous, as the gates of soulsdescending into this life, or passing out of it in their ascent to the Gods;Cancer being the gate of descent, and Capricorn of ascent. These are the twoavenues of the immortals passing up and down from earth to heaven, and fromheaven to earth.”The so-called chair of St. Peter, in Rome, was believed to have been used in oneof the pagan Mysteries, possibly that of Mithras, in whose subterranean grottoesthe votaries of the Christian Mysteries met in the early days of their faith. InAnacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins writes that in 1662, while cleaning this sacredchair of Bar-Jonas, the Twelve Labors of Hercules were discovered upon it, andthat later the French discovered upon the same chair the Mohammedan confessionof faith, written in Arabic.Initiation into the rites of Mithras, like initiation into many other ancientschools of philosophy, apparently consisted of three important degrees.Preparation for these degrees consisted of self-purification, the building up ofthe intellectual powers, and the control of the animal nature. In the firstdegree the candidate was given a crown upon the point of a sword and instructedin the mysteries of Mithras’ hidden power. Probably he was taught that thegolden crown represented his own spiritual nature, which must be objectified andunfolded before he could truly glorify Mithras; for Mithras was his own soul,standing as mediator between Ormuzd, his spirit, and Ahriman, his animal nature.In the second degree he was given the armor of intelligence and purity and sentinto the darkness of subterranean pits to fight the beasts of lust, passion, anddegeneracy. In the third degree he was given a cape, upon which were drawn orwoven the signs of the zodiac and other astronomical symbols. After hisinitiations were over, he was hailed as one who had risen from the dead, wasinstructed in the secret teachings of the Persian mystics, and became afull-fledged member of the order. Candidates who successfully passed theMithraic initiations were called Lions and were marked upon their foreheads withthe Egyptian cross. Mithras himself is often pictured with the head of a lionand two pairs of wings. Throughout the entire ritual were repeated references tothe birth of Mithras as the Sun God, his sacrifice for man, his death that menmight have eternal life, and lastly, his resurrection and the saving of allhumanity by his intercession before the throne of Ormuzd. (See Heckethorn.)While the cult of Mithras did not reach the philosophic heights attained byZarathustra, its effect upon the civilization of the Western world wasfar-reaching, for at one time nearly all Europe was converted to its doctrines.Rome, in her intercourse with other nations, inoculated them with her religiousprinciples; and many later institutions have exhibited Mithraic culture. Thereference to the “Lion” and the “Grip of the Lion’s Paw” in the Master Mason’sdegree have a strong Mithraic tinge and may easily have originated from thiscult. A ladder of seven rungs appears in the Mithraic initiation. Faber is ofthe opinion that this ladder was originally a pyramid of seven steps. It ispossible that the Masonic ladder with seven rungs had its origin in thisMithraic symbol. Women were never permitted to enter the Mithraic Order, butchildren of the male sex were initiates long before they reached maturity. Therefusal to permit women to join the Masonic Order may be based on the esotericreason given in the secret instructions of the Mithraics. This cult is anotherexcellent example of those secret societies whose legends are largely symbolicrepresentations of the sun and his journey through the houses of the heavens.Mithras, rising from a stone, is merely the sun rising over the horizon, or, asthe ancients supposed, out of the horizon, at the vernal equinox.John O‘Neill disputes the theory that Mithras was intended as a solar deity. InThe Night of the Gods he writes: “The Avestan Mithra, the yazata of light, has‘10,000 eyes, high, with full knowledge (perethuvaedayana), strong, sleeplessand ever awake (jaghaurvaunghem).’ The supreme god Ahura Mazda also has one Eye,or else it is said that ‘with his eyes, the sun, moon and stars, he seeseverything.’ The theory that Mithra was originally a title of the supremeheavens-god—putting the sun out of court—is the only one that answers allrequirements. It will be evident that here we have origins in abundance for theFreemason’s Eye and ‘its nunquam dormio.”’ The reader must not confuse thePersian Mithra with the Vedic Mitra. According to Alexander Wilder, “TheMithraic rites superseded the Mysteries of Bacchus, and became the foundation ofthe Gnostic system, which for many centuries prevailed in Asia, Egypt, and eventhe remote West.”"},{"pageContent":"III The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies PART II The entire history of Christian and pagan Gnosticism is shrouded in the deepestmystery and obscurity; for, while the Gnostics were undoubtedly prolificwriters, little of their literature has survived. They brought down uponthemselves the animosity of the early Christian Church, and when thisinstitution reached its position of world power it destroyed all availablerecords of the Gnostic cultus. The name Gnostic means wisdom, or knowledge, andis derived from the Greek Gnosis. The members of the order claimed to befamiliar with the secret doctrines of early Christianity. They interpreted theChristian Mysteries according to pagan symbolism. Their secret information andphilosophic tenets they concealed from the profane and taught to a small grouponly of especially initiated persons.Simon Magus, the magician of New Testament fame, is often supposed to have beenthe founder of Gnosticism. If this be true, the sect was formed during thecentury after Christ and is probably the first of the many branches which havesprung from the main trunk of Christianity. Everything with which theenthusiasts of the early Christian Church might not agree they declared to beinspired by the Devil. That Simon Magus had mysterious and supernatural powersis conceded even by his enemies, but they maintained that these powers were lentto him by the infernal spirits and furies which they asserted were his everpresent companions. Undoubtedly the most interesting legend concerning Simon isthat which tells of his theosophic contests with the Apostle Peter while the twowere promulgating their differing doctrines in Rome. According to the story thatthe Church Fathers have preserved, Simon was to prove his spiritual superiorityby ascending to heaven in a chariot of fire. He was actually picked up andcarried many feet into the air by invisible powers. When St. Peter saw this, hecried out in a loud voice, ordering the demons (spirits of the air) to releasetheir hold upon the magician. The evil spirits, when so ordered by the greatsaint, were forced to obey. Simon fell a great distance and was killed, whichdecisively proved the superiority of the Christian powers. This story isundoubtedly manufactured out of whole cloth, as it is only one out of manyaccounts concerning his death, few of which agree. As more and more evidence isbeing amassed to the effect that St. Peter was never in Rome, its last possiblevestige of authenticity is rapidly being dissipated.008 [images/00009.jpg] THE DEATH OF SIMON THE MAGICIAN.Simon Magus, having called upon the Spirits of the Air, is here shown beingpicked up by the demons. St. Peter demands that the evil genii release theirhold upon the magician. The demons are forced to comply and Simon Magus iskilled by the fall. That Simon was a philosopher there is no doubt, for wherever his exact words arepreserved his synthetic and transcending thoughts are beautifully expressed. Theprinciples of Gnosticism are well described in the following verbatim statementby him, supposed to have been preserved by Hippolytus: “To you, therefore, I saywhat I say, and write what I write. And the writing is this. Of the universalÆons [periods, planes, or cycles of creative and created life in substance andspace, celestial creatures] there are two shoots, without beginning or end,springing from one Root, which is the power invisible, inapprehensible silence[Bythos]. Of these shoots one is manifested from above, which is the GreatPower, the Universal Mind ordering all things, male, and the other, [ismanifested] from below, the Great Thought, female, producing all things. Hencepairing with each other, they unite and manifest the Middle Distance,incomprehensible Air, without beginning or end. In this is the Father Whosustains all things, and nourishes those things which have a beginning and end.”(See Simon Magus, by G.R.S. Mead.) By this we are to understand thatmanifestation is the result of a positive and a negative principle, one actingupon the other, and it takes place in the middle plane, or point of equilibrium,called the pleroma. This pleroma is a peculiar substance produced out of theblending of the spiritual and material æons. Out of the pleroma wasindividualized the Demiurgus, the immortal mortal, to whom we are responsiblefor our physical existence and the suffering we must go through in connectionwith it. In the Gnostic system, three pairs of opposites, called Syzygies,emanated from the Eternal One. These, with Himself, make the total of seven. Thesix (three pairs) Æons (living, divine principles) were described by Simon inthe Philosophumena in the following manner: The first two were Mind (Nous) andThought (Epinoia). Then came Voice (Phone) and its opposite, Name (Onoma), andlastly, Reason (Logismos) and Reflection (Enthumesis). From these primordialsix, united with the Eternal Flame, came forth the Æons (Angels) who formed thelower worlds through the direction of the Demiurgus. (See the works of H. P.Blavatsky.) How this first Gnosticism of Simon Magus and Menander, his disciple,was amplified, and frequently distorted, by later adherents to the cult must nowbe considered.The School of Gnosticism was divided into two major parts, commonly called theSyrian Cult and the Alexandrian Cult. These schools agreed in essentials, butthe latter division was more inclined to be pantheistic, while the former wasdualistic. While the Syrian cult was largely Simonian, the Alexandrian Schoolwas the outgrowth of the philosophical deductions of a clever EgyptianChristian, Basilides by name, who claimed to have received his instructions fromthe Apostle Matthew. Like Simon Magus, he was an emana- tionist, withNeo-Platonic inclinations. In fact, the entire Gnostic Mystery is based upon thehypothesis of emanations as being the logical connection between theirreconcilable opposites Absolute Spirit and Absolute Substance, which theGnostics believed to have been coexistent in Eternity. Some assert thatBasilides was the true founder of Gnosticism, but there is much evidence to theeffect that Simon Magus laid down its fundamental principles in the precedingcentury.The Alexandrian Basilides inculcated Egyptian Hermeticism, Oriental occultism,Chaldean astrology, and Persian philosophy in his followers, and in hisdoctrines sought to unite the schools of early Christianity with the ancientpagan Mysteries. To him is attributed the formulation of that peculiar conceptof the Deity which carries the name of Abraxas. In discussing the originalmeaning of this word, Godfrey Higgins, in his Celtic Druids, has demonstratedthat the numerological powers of the letters forming the word Abraxas when addedtogether result in the sum of 365. The same author also notes that the nameMithras when treated in a similar manner has the same numerical value. Basilidestaught that the powers of the universe were divided into 365 Æons, or spiritualcycles, and that the sum of all these together was the Supreme Father, and toHim he gave the Qabbalistical appellation Abraxas, as being symbolical,numerologically, of His divine powers, attributes, and emanations. Abraxas isusually symbolized as a composite creature, with the body of a human being andthe head of a rooster, and with each of his legs ending in a serpent. C. W.King, in his Gnostics and Their Remains, gives the following concise descriptionof the Gnostic philosophy of Basilides, quoting from the writings of the earlyChristian bishop and martyr, St. Irenaeus: “He asserted that God, the uncreated,eternal Father, had first brought forth Nous, or Mind; this the Logos, Word;this again Phronesis, Intelligence; from Phronesis sprung Sophia, Wisdom, andDynamis, Strength.”In describing Abraxas, C. W. King says: “Bellermann considers the compositeimage, inscribed with the actual name Abraxas, to be a Gnostic Pantheos,representing the Supreme Being, with the Five Emanations marked out byappropriate symbols. From the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity,spring the two supporters, Nous and Logos, expressed in the serpents, symbols ofthe inner senses, and the quickening understanding; on which account the Greekshad made the serpent the attribute of Pallas. His head—that of a cock—representsPhronesis, that bird being the emblem of foresight and of vigilance. His twoarms hold the symbols of Sophia and Dynamis: the shield of Wisdom and the whipof Power.”The Gnostics were divided in their opinions concerning the Dermiurgus, orcreator of the lower worlds. He established the terrestrial universe with theaid of six sons, or emanations (possibly the planetary Angels) which He formedout of, and yet within, Himself. As stated before, the Demiurgus wasindividualized as the lowest creation out of the substance called pleroma. Onegroup of the Gnostics was of the opinion that the Demiurgus was the cause of allmisery and was an evil creature, who by building this lower world had separatedthe souls of men from truth by encasing them in mortal vehicles. The other sectviewed the Demiurgus as being divinely inspired and merely fulfilling thedictates of the invisible Lord. Some Gnostics were of the opinion that theJewish God, Jehovah, was the Demiurgus. This concept, under a slightly differentname, apparently influenced mediæval Rosicrucianism, which viewed Jehovah as theLord of the material universe rather than as the Supreme Deity. Mythologyabounds with the stories of gods who partook of both celestial and terrestrialnatures. Odin, of Scandinavia, is a good example of a deity subject tomortality, bowing before the laws of Nature and yet being, in certain senses atleast, a Supreme Deity.The Gnostic viewpoint concerning the Christ is well worthy of consideration.This order claimed to be the only sect to have actual pictures of the DivineSyrian. While these were, in all probability, idealistic conceptions of theSavior based upon existing sculpturings and paintings of the pagan sun gods,they were all Christianity had. To the Gnostics, the Christ was thepersonification of Nous, the Divine Mind, and emanated from the higher spiritualÆons. He descended into the body of Jesus at the baptism and left it againbefore the crucifixion. The Gnostics declared that the Christ was not crucified,as this Divine Nous could not suffer death, but that Simon, the Cyrenian,offered his life instead and that the Nous, by means of its power, caused Simonto resemble Jesus. Irenæus makes the following statement concerning the cosmicsacrifice of the Christ:“When the uncreated, unnamed Father saw the corruption of mankind, He sent Hisfirstborn, Nous, into the world, in the form of Christ, for the redemption ofall who believe in Him, out of the power of those that have fabricated the world(the Demiurgus, and his six sons, the planetary genii). He appeared amongst menas the Man Jesus, and wrought miracles.” (See King’s Gnostics and TheirRemains.)The Gnostics divided humanity into three parts: those who, as savages, worshipedonly the visible Nature; those who, like the Jews, worshiped the Demiurgus; andlastly, themselves, or others of a similar cult, including certain sects ofChristians, who worshiped Nous (Christ) and the true spiritual light of thehigher Æons.After the death of Basilides, Valentinus became the leading inspiration of theGnostic movement. He still further complicated the system of Gnostic philosophyby adding infinitely to the details. He increased the number of emanations fromthe Great One (the Abyss) to fifteen pairs and also laid much emphasis on theVirgin Sophia, or Wisdom. In the Books of the Savior, parts of which arecommonly known as the Pistis Sophia, may be found much material concerning thisstrange doctrine of Æons and their strange inhabitants. James Freeman Clarke, inspeaking of the doctrines of the Gnostics, says: “These doctrines, strange asthey seem to us, had a wide influence in the Christian Church.” Many of thetheories of the ancient Gnostics, especially those concerning scientificsubjects, have been substantiated by modern research. Several sects branched offfrom the main stem of Gnosticism, such as the Valentinians, the Ophites (serpentworshipers), and the Adamites. After the third century their power waned, andthe Gnostics practically vanished from the philosophic world. An effort was madeduring the Middle Ages to resurrect the principles of Gnosticism, but owing tothe destruction of their records the material necessary was not available. Eventoday there are evidences of Gnostic philosophy in the modern world, but theybear other names and their true origin is not suspected. Many of the Gnosticconcepts have actually been incorporated into the dogmas of the ChristianChurch, and our newer interpretations of Christianity are often along the linesof Gnostic emanationism."},{"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIES OF ASAR-HAPI The identity of the Greco-Egyptian Serapis (known to the Greeks as Serapis andthe Egyptians as Asar-Hapi) is shrouded by an impenetrable veil of mystery.While this deity was a familiar figure among the symbols of the secret Egyptianinitiatory rites, his arcane nature was revealed only to those who had fulfilledthe requirements of the Serapic cultus. Therefore, in all probability, exceptingthe initiated priests, the Egyptians themselves were ignorant of his truecharacter. So far as known, there exists no authentic account of the rites ofSerapis, but an analysis of the deity and his accompanying symbols reveals theirsalient points. In an oracle delivered to the King of Cyprus, Serapis describedhimself thus:> “A god I am such as I show to thee,> The Starry Heavens are my head, my trunk the sea,> Earth forms my feet, mine ears the air supplies,> The Sun’s far-darting, brilliant rays, mine eyes.” Several unsatisfactory attempts have been made to etymologize the word Serapis.Godfrey Higgins notes that Soros was the name given by the Egyptians to a stonecoffin, and Apis was Osiris incarnate in the sacred bull. These two wordscombined result in Soros-Apis or Sor-Apis, “the tomb of the bull.” But it isimprobable that the Egyptians would worship a coffin in the form of a man.Several ancient authors, including Macrobius, have affirmed that Serapis was aname for the Sun, because his image so often had a halo of light about its head.In his Oration Upon the Sovereign Sun, Julian speaks of the deity in thesewords: “One Jove, one Pluto, one Sun is Serapis.” In Hebrew, Serapis is Saraph,meaning “to blaze out” or “to blaze up.” For this reason the Jews designated oneof their hierarchies of spiritual beings, Seraphim.The most common theory, however, regarding the origin of the name Serapis isthat which traces its derivation from the compound Osiris-Apis. At one time theEgyptians believed that the dead were absorbed into the nature of Osiris, thegod of the dead. While marked similarity exists between Osiris-Apis and Serapis,the theory advanced by Egyptologists that Serapis is merely a name given to thedead Apis, or sacred bull of Egypt, is untenable in view of the transcendentwisdom possessed by the Egyptian priestcraft, who, in all probability, used thegod to symbolize the soul of the world (anima mundi). The material body ofNature was called Apis; the soul which escaped from the body at death but wasenmeshed with the form during physical life was designated Serapis.C. W. King believes Serapis to be a deity of Brahmanic extraction, his namebeing the Grecianized form of Ser-adah or Sri-pa, two titles ascribed to Yama,the Hindu god of death. This appears reasonable, especially since there is alegend to the effect that Serapis, in the form of a bull, was driven by Bacchusfrom India to Egypt. The priority of the Hindu Mysteries would furthersubstantiate such a theory.Among other meanings suggested for the word Serapis are: “The Sacred Bull,” “TheSun in Taurus,” “The Soul of Osiris,” “The Sacred Serpent,” and “The Retiring ofthe Bull.” The last appellation has reference to the ceremony of drowning thesacred Apis in the waters of the Nile every twenty-five years.There is considerable evidence that the famous statue of Serapis in the Serapeumat Alexandria was originally worshiped under another name at Sinope, from whichit was brought to Alexandria. There is also a legend which tells that Serapiswas a very early king of the Egyptians, to whom they owed the foundation oftheir philosophical and scientific power. After his death this king was elevatedto the estate of a god. Phylarchus declared that the word Serapis means “thepower that disposed the universe into its present beautiful order.”In his Isis and Osiris, Plutarch gives the following account of the origin ofthe magnificent statue of Serapis which stood in the Serapeum at Alexandria:009 [images/00010.jpg] THE ALEXANDRIAN SERAPIS.Serapis is often shown standing on the back of the sacred crocodile, carrying inhis left hand a rule with which to measure the inundations of the Nile, andbalancing with his right hand a curious emblem consisting of an animal withthree heads. The first head—that of a lion—signified the present; the secondhead—that of a wolf—the past; and the third head—that of a dog—the future. Thebody with its three heads was enveloped by the twisted coils of a serpent.Figures of Serapis are occasionally accompanied by Cerberus, the three-headeddog of Pluto, and—like Jupiter—carry baskets of grain upon their heads. While he was Pharaoh of Egypt, Ptolemy Soter had a strange dream in which hebeheld a tremendous statue, which came to life and ordered the Pharaoh to bringit to Alexandria with all possible speed. Ptolemy Soter, not knowing thewhereabouts of the statue, was sorely perplexed as to how he could discover it.While the Pharaoh was relating his dream, a great traveler by the name ofSosibius, coming forward, declared that he had seen such an image at Sinope. ThePharaoh immediately dispatched Soteles and Dionysius to negotiate for theremoval of the figure to Alexandria. Three years elapsed before the image wasfinally obtained, the representatives of the Pharaoh finally stealing it andconcealing the theft by spreading a story that the statue had come to life and,walking down the street leading from its temple, had boarded the ship preparedfor its transportation to Alexandria. Upon its arrival in Egypt, the figure wasbrought into the presence of two Egyptian Initiates—the Eumolpid Timotheus andManetho the Sebennite—who immediately pronounced it to be Serapis. The prieststhen declared that it was equipollent to Pluto. This was a masterly stroke, forin Serapis the Greeks and Egyptians found a deity in common and thus religiousunity was consummated between the two nations.Several figures of Serapis that stood in his various temples in Egypt and Romehave been described by early authors. Nearly all these showed Grecian ratherthan Egyptian influence. In some the body of the god was encircled by the coilsof a great serpent. Others showed him as a composite of Osiris and Apis.A description of the god that in all probability is reasonably accurate is thatwhich represents him as a tall, powerful figure, conveying the twofoldimpression of manly strength and womanly grace. His face portrayed a deeplypensive mood, the expression inclining toward sadness. His hair was long andarranged in a somewhat feminine manner, resting in curls upon his breast andshoulders. The face, save for its heavy beard, was also decidedly feminine. Thefigure of Serapis was usually robed from head to foot in heavy draperies,believed by initiates to conceal the fact that his body was androgynous.Various substances were used in making the statues of Serapis. Some undoubtedlywere carved from stone or marble by skilled craftsmen; others may have been castfrom base or precious metals. One colossus of Serapis was composed of plates ofvarious metals fitted together. In a labyrinth sacred to Serapis stood athirteen-foot statue of him reputed to have been made from a single emerald.Modern writers, discussing this image, state that it was made of green glasspoured into a mold. According to the Egyptians, however, it withstood all thetests of an actual emerald.Clement of Alexandria describes a figure of Serapis compounded from thefollowing elements: First, filings of gold, silver, lead, and tin; second, allmanner of Egyptian stones, including sapphires, hematites, emeralds, andtopazes; all these being ground down and mixed together with the coloring matterleft over from the funeral of Osiris and Apis. The result was a rare and curiousfigure, indigo in color. Some of the statues of Serapis must have been formed ofextremely hard substances, for when a Christian soldier, carrying out the edictof Theodosius, struck the Alexandrian Serapis with his ax, that instrument wasshattered into fragments and sparks flew from it. It is also quite probable thatSerapis was worshiped in the form of a serpent, in common with many of thehigher deities of the Egyptian and Greek pantheons.Serapis was called Theon Heptagrammaton, or the god with the name of sevenletters. The name Serapis (like Abraxas and Mithras) contains seven letters. Intheir hymns to Serapis the priests chanted the seven vowels. OccasionallySerapis is depicted with horns or a coronet of seven rays. That evidentlyrepresented the seven divine intelligences manifesting through the solar light.The Encyclopædia Britannica notes that the earliest authentic mention of Serapisis in connection with the death of Alexander. Such was the prestige of Serapisthat he alone of the gods was consulted in behalf of the dying king.The Egyptian secret school of philosophy was divided into the Lesser and theGreater Mysteries, the former being sacred to Isis and the latter to Serapis andOsiris. Wilkinson is of the opinion that only the priests were permitted toenter the Greater Mysteries. Even the heir to the throne was not eligible untilhe had been crowned Pharaoh, when, by virtue of his kingly office, heautomatically became a priest and the temporal head of the state religion. (SeeWilkinson’s Manners and Customs of the Egyptians.) A limited number wereadmitted into the Greater Mysteries: these preserved their secrets inviolate.Much of the information concerning the rituals of the higher degrees of theEgyptian Mysteries has been gleaned from an examination of the chambers andpassageways in which the initiations were given. Under the temple of Serapisdestroyed by Theodosius were found strange mechanical contrivances constructedby the priests in the subterranean crypts and caverns where the nocturnalinitiatory rites were celebrated. These machines indicate the severe tests ofmoral and physical courage undergone by the candidates. After passing throughthese tortuous ways, the neophytes who survived the ordeals were ushered intothe presence of Serapis, a noble and awe-inspiring figure illumined by unseenlights.Labyrinths were also a striking feature in connection with the Rite of Serapis,and E. A. Wallis Budge, in his Gods of the Egyptians, depicts Serapis(Minotaur-like) with the body of a man and the head of a bull. Labyrinths weresymbolic of the involvements and illusions of the lower world through whichwanders the soul of man in its search for truth. In the labyrinth dwells thelower animal man with the head of the bull, who seeks to destroy the soulentangled in the maze of worldly ignorance. In this relation Serapis becomes theTryer or Adversary who tests the souls of those seeking union with theImmortals. The maze was also doubtless used to represent the solar system, theBull-Man representing the sun dwelling in the mystic maze of its planets, moons,and asteroids.The Gnostic Mysteries were acquainted with the arcane meaning of Serapis, andthrough the medium of Gnosticism this god became inextricably associated withearly Christianity. In fact, the Emperor Hadrian, while traveling in Egypt inA.D. 134, declared in a letter to Servianus that the worshipers of Serapis wereChristians and that the Bishops of the church also worshiped at his shrine. Heeven declared that the Patriarch himself, when in Egypt, was forced to adoreSerapis as well as Christ. (See Parsons’ New Light on the Great Pyramid.)The little-suspected importance of Serapis as a prototype of Christ can be bestappreciated after a consideration of the following extract from C. W. King’sGnostics and Their Remains: “There can be no doubt that the head of Serapis,marked as the face is by a grave and pensive majesty, supplied the first ideafor the conventional portraits of the Saviour. The Jewish prejudices of thefirst converts were so powerful that we may be sure no attempt was made todepict His countenance until some generations after all that had beheld it onearth had passed away.”Serapis gradually usurped the positions previously occupied by the otherEgyptian and Greek gods, and became the supreme deity of both religions. Hispower continued until the fourth century of the Christian Era. In A.D. 385,Theodosius, that would-be exterminator of pagan philosophy, issued his memorableedict De Idolo Serapidis Diruendo. When the Christian soldiers, in obedience tothis order, entered the Serapeum at Alexandria to destroy the image of Serapiswhich had stood there for centuries, so great was their veneration for the godthat they dared not touch the image lest the ground should open at their feetand engulf them. At length, overcoming their fear, they demolished the statue,sacked the building, and finally as a fitting climax to their offense burned themagnificent library which was housed within the lofty apartments of theSerapeum. Several writers have recorded the remarkable fact that Christiansymbols were found in the ruined foundations of this pagan temple. Socrates, achurch historian of the fifth century, declared that after the pious Christianshad razed the Serapeum at Alexandria and scattered the demons who dwelt thereunder the guise of gods, beneath the foundations was found the monogram ofChrist!Two quotations will further establish the relationship existing between theMysteries of Serapis and those of other ancient peoples. The first is fromRichard Payne Knight’s Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology: “HenceVarro [in De Lingua Latina] says that Cœlum and Terra, that is universal mindand productive body, were the Great Gods of the Samothracian Mysteries; and thesame as the Serapis and Isis of the later Ægyptians: the Taautos and Astarte ofthe Phœnicians, and the Saturn and Ops of the Latins.” The second quotation isfrom Albert Pike’s Morals and Dogma: “‘Thee,’ says Martianus Capella, in hishymn to the Sun, ‘dwellers on the Nile adore as Serapis, and Memphis worships asOsiris: in the sacred rites of Persia thou art Mithras, in Phrygia, Atys, andLibya bows down to thee as Ammon, and Phœnician Byblos as Adonis; thus the wholeworld adores thee under different names.”’"},{"pageContent":"THE ODINIC MYSTERIES The date of the founding of the Odinic Mysteries is uncertain, some writersdeclaring that they were established in the first century before Christ; others,the first century after Christ. Robert Macoy, 33°, gives the followingdescription of their origin: “It appears from the northern chronicles that inthe first century of the Christian Era, Sigge, the chief of the Aser, an Asiatictribe, emigrated from the Caspian sea and the Caucasus into northern Europe. Hedirected his course northwesterly from the Black sea to Russia, over which,according to tradition, he placed one of his sons as a ruler, as he is said tohave done over the Saxons and the Franks. He then advanced through Cimbria toDenmark, which acknowledged his fifth son Skiold as its sovereign, and passedover to Sweden, where Gylf, who did homage to the wonderful stranger, and wasinitiated into his mysteries, then ruled. He soon made himself master here,built Sigtuna as the capital of his empire, and promulgated a new code of laws,and established the sacred mysteries. He, himself, assumed the name of Odin,founded the priesthood of the twelve Drottars (Druids?) who conducted the secretworship, and the administration of justice, and, as prophets, revealed thefuture. The secret rites of these mysteries celebrated the death of Balder, thebeautiful and lovely, and represented the grief of Gods and men at his death,and his restoration to life.” (General History of Freemasonry.)After his death, the historical Odin was apotheosized, his identity being mergedinto that of the mythological Odin, god of wisdom, whose cult he hadpromulgated. Odinism then supplanted the worship of Thor, the thunderer, thesupreme deity of the ancient Scandinavian pantheon. The mound where, accordingto legend, King Odin was buried is still to be seen near the site of his greattemple at Upsala.The twelve Drottars who presided over the Odinic Mysteries evidently personifiedthe twelve holy and ineffable names of Odin. The rituals of the Odinic Mysterieswere very similar to those of the Greeks, Persians, and Brahmins, after whichthey were patterned. The Drottars, who symbolized the signs of the zodiac, werethe custodians of the arts and sciences, which they revealed to those who passedsuccessfully the ordeals of initiation. Like many other pagan cults, the OdinicMysteries, as an institution, were destroyed by Christianity, but the underlyingcause of their fall was the corruption of the priesthood.Mythology is nearly always the ritual and the symbolism of a Mystery school.Briefly stated, the sacred drama which formed the basis of the Odinic Mysterieswas as follows:The Supreme, invisible Creator of all things was called All-Father. His regentin Nature was Odin, the one-eyed god. Like Quetzalcoatl, Odin was elevated tothe dignity of the Supreme Deity. According to the Drottars, the universe wasfashioned from the body of Ymir, the hoarfrost giant. Ymir was formed from theclouds of mist that rose from Ginnungagap, the great cleft in chaos into whichthe primordial frost giants and flame giants had hurled snow and fire. The threegods—Odin, Vili, and Ve—slew Ymir and from him formed the world. From Ymir’svarious members the different parts of Nature were fashioned.After Odin had established order, he caused a wonderful palace, called Asgard,to be built on the top of a mountain, and here the twelve Æsir (gods) dwelttogether, far above the limitations of mortal men. On this mountain also wasValhalla, the palace of the slain, where those who had heroically died foughtand feasted day after day. Each night their wounds were healed and the boarwhose flesh they ate renewed itself as rapidly as it was consumed.Balder the Beautiful—the Scandinavian Christ—was the beloved son of Odin. Balderwas not warlike; his kindly and beautiful spirit brought peace and joy to thehearts of the gods, and they all loved him save one. As Jesus had a Judas amongHis twelve disciples, so one of the twelve gods was false—Loki, thepersonification of evil. Loki caused Höthr, the blind god of fate, to shootBalder with a mistletoe arrow. With the death of Balder, light and joy vanishedfrom the lives of the other deities. Heartbroken, the gods gathered to find amethod whereby they could resurrect this spirit of eternal life and youth. Theresult was the establishment of the Mysteries.The Odinic Mysteries were given in underground crypts or caves, the chambers,nine in number, representing the Nine Worlds of the Mysteries. The candidateseeking admission was assigned the task of raising Balder from the dead.Although he did not realize it, he himself played the part of Balder. He calledhimself a wanderer; the caverns through which he passed were symbolic of theworlds and spheres of Nature. The priests who initiated him were emblematic ofthe sun, the moon, and the stars. The three supreme initiators—the Sublime, theEqual to the Sublime, and the Highest—were analogous to the Worshipful Masterand the Junior and Senior Wardens of a Masonic lodge.After wandering for hours through the intricate passageways, the candidate wasushered into the presence of a statue of Balder the Beautiful, the prototype ofall initiates into the Mysteries. This figure stood in the center of a greatapartment roofed with shields. In the midst of the chamber stood a plant withseven blossoms, emblematic of the planets. In this room, which symbolized thehome of the Æsir, or Wisdom, the neophyte took his oath of secrecy and pietyupon the naked blade of a sword. He drank the sanctified mead from a bowl madeof a human skull and, having passed successfully through all the tortures andtrials designed to divert him from the course of wisdom, he was finallypermitted to unveil the mystery of Odin—the personification of wisdom. He waspresented, in the name of Balder, with the sacred ring of the order; he washailed as a man reborn; and it was said of him that he had died and had beenraised again without passing through the gates of death.Richard Wagner’s immortal composition, Der Ring des Nibelungen, is based uponthe Mystery rituals of the Odinic cult. While the great composer took manyliberties with the original story, the Ring Operas, declared to be the grandesttetralogy of music dramas the world possesses, have caught and preserved in aremarkable manner the majesty and power of the original sagas. Beginning withDas Rheingold, the action proceeds through Die Walküre and Siegfried to anawe-inspiring climax in Götterdämmerung, “The Twilight of the Gods.”"},{"pageContent":"IV The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies PART III The most famous of the ancient religious Mysteries were the Eleusinian, whoserites were celebrated every five years in the city of Eleusis to honor Ceres(Demeter, Rhea, or Isis) and her daughter, Persephone. The initiates of theEleusinian School were famous throughout Greece for the beauty of theirphilosophic concepts and the high standards of morality which they demonstratedin their daily lives. Because of their excellence, these Mysteries spread toRome and Britain, and later the initiations were given in both these countries.The Eleusinian Mysteries, named for the community in Attica where the sacreddramas were first presented, are generally believed to have been founded byEumolpos about fourteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, and throughthe Platonic system of philosophy their principles have been preserved to moderntimes.The rites of Eleusis, with their mystic interpretations of Nature’s mostprecious secrets, overshadowed the civilizations of their time and graduallyabsorbed many smaller schools, incorporating into their own system whatevervaluable information these lesser institutions possessed. Heckethorn sees in theMysteries of Ceres and Bacchus a metamorphosis of the rites of Isis and Osiris,and there is every reason to believe that all so-called secret schools of theancient world were branches from one philosophic tree which, with its root inheaven and its branches on the earth, is—like the spirit of man—an invisible butever-present cause of the objectified vehicles that give it expression. TheMysteries were the channels through which this one philosophic light wasdisseminated; and their initiates, resplendent with intellectual and spiritualunderstanding, were the perfect fruitage of the divine tree, bearing witnessbefore the material world of the recondite source of all Light and Truth.The rites of Eleusis were divided into what were called the Lesser and theGreater Mysteries. According to James Gardner, the Lesser Mysteries werecelebrated in the spring (probably at the time of the vernal equinox) in thetown of Agræ, and the Greater, in the fall (the time of the autumnal equinox) atEleusis or Athens. It is supposed that the former were given annually and thelatter every five years. The rituals of the Eleusinians were highly involved,and to understand them required a deep study of Greek mythology, which theyinterpreted in its esoteric light with the aid of their secret keys.The Lesser Mysteries were dedicated to Persephone. In his Eleusinian and BacchicMysteries, Thomas Taylor sums up their purpose as follows: “The Lesser Mysterieswere designed by the ancient theologists, their founders, to signify occultlythe condition of the unpurified soul invested with an earthy body, and envelopedin a material and physical nature.”The legend used in the Lesser rites is that of the abduction of the goddessPersephone, the daughter of Ceres, by Pluto, the lord of the underworld, orHades. While Persephone is picking flowers in a beautiful meadow, the earthsuddenly opens and the gloomy lord of death, riding in a magnificent chariot,emerges from its somber depths and, grasping her in his arms, carries thescreaming and struggling goddess to his subterranean palace, where he forces herto become his queen.It is doubtful whether many of the initiates themselves understood the mysticmeaning of this allegory, for most of them apparently believed that it referredsolely to the succession of the seasons. It is difficult to obtain satisfactoryinformation concerning the Mysteries, for the candidates were bound byinviolable oaths never to reveal their inner secrets to the profane. At thebeginning of the ceremony of initiation, the candidate stood upon the skins ofanimals sacrificed for the purpose, and vowed that death should seal his lipsbefore he would divulge the sacred truths which were about to be communicated tohim. Through indirect channels, however, some of their secrets have beenpreserved. The teachings given to the neophytes were substantially as follows:The soul of man—often called Psyche, and in the Eleusinian Mysteries symbolizedby Persephone—is essentially a spiritual thing. Its true home is in the higherworlds, where, free from the bondage of material form and material concepts, itis said to be truly alive and self-expressive. The human, or physical, nature ofman, according to this doctrine, is a tomb, a quagmire, a false and impermanentthing, the source of all sorrow and suffering. Plato describes the body as thesepulcher of the soul; and by this he means not only the human form but also thehuman nature.The gloom and depression of the Lesser Mysteries represented the agony of thespiritual soul unable to express itself because it has accepted the limitationsand illusions of the human environment. The crux of the Eleusinian argument wasthat man is neither better nor wiser after death than during life. If he doesnot rise above ignorance during his sojourn here, man goes at death intoeternity to wander about forever, making the same mistakes which he made here.If he does not outgrow the desire for material possessions here, he will carryit with him into the invisible world, where, because he can never gratify thedesire, he will continue in endless agony. Dante’s Inferno is symbolicallydescriptive of the sufferings of those who never freed their spiritual naturesfrom the cravings, habits, viewpoints, and limitations of their Plutonicpersonalities. Those who made no endeavor to improve themselves (whose soulshave slept) during their physical lives, passed at death into Hades, where,lying in rows, they slept through all eternity as they had slept through life.To the Eleusinian philosophers, birth into the physical world was death in thefullest sense of the word, and the only true birth was that of the spiritualsoul of man rising out of the womb of his own fleshly nature. “The soul is deadthat slumbers,” says Longfellow, and in this he strikes the keynote of theEleusinian Mysteries. Just as Narcissus, gazing at himself in the water (theancients used this mobile element to symbolize the transitory, illusionary,material universe) lost his life trying to embrace a reflection, so man, gazinginto the mirror of Nature and accepting as his real self the senseless clay thathe sees reflected, loses the opportunity afforded by physical life to unfold hisimmortal, invisible Self.An ancient initiate once said that the living are ruled by the dead. Only thoseconversant with the Eleusinian concept of life could understand that statement.It means that the majority of people are not ruled by their living spirits butby their senseless (hence dead) animal personalities. Transmigration andreincarnation were taught in these Mysteries, but in a somewhat unusual manner.It was believed that at midnight the invisible worlds were closest to theterrestrial sphere and that souls coming into material existence slipped induring the midnight hour. For this reason many of the Eleusinian ceremonies wereperformed at midnight. Some of those sleeping spirits who had failed to awakentheir higher natures during the earth life and who now floated around in theinvisible worlds, surrounded by a darkness of their own making, occasionallyslipped through at this hour and assumed the forms of various creatures.The mystics of Eleusis also laid stress upon the evil of suicide, explainingthat there was a profound mystery concerning this crime of which they could notspeak, but warning their disciples that a great sorrow comes to all who taketheir own lives. This, in substance, constitutes the esoteric doctrine given tothe initiates of the Lesser Mysteries. As the degree dealt largely with themiseries of those who failed to make the best use of their philosophicopportunities, the chambers of initiation were subterranean and the horrors ofHades were vividly depicted in a complicated ritualistic drama. After passingsuccessfully through the tortuous passageways, with their trials and dangers,the candidate received the honorary title of Mystes. This meant one who sawthrough a veil or had a clouded vision. It also signified that the candidate hadbeen brought up to the veil, which would be torn away in the higher degree. Themodern word mystic, as referring to a seeker after truth according to thedictates of the heart along the path of faith, is probably derived from thisancient word, for faith is belief in the reality of things unseen or veiled.The Greater Mysteries (into which the candidate was admitted only after he hadsuccessfully passed through the ordeals of the Lesser, and not always then) weresacred to Ceres, the mother of Persephone, and represent her as wanderingthrough the world in quest of her abducted daughter. Ceres carried two torches,intuition and reason, to aid her in the search for her lost child (the soul). Atlast she found Persephone not far from Eleusis, and out of gratitude taught thepeople there to cultivate corn, which is sacred to her. She also founded theMysteries. Ceres appeared before Pluto, god of the souls of the dead, andpleaded with him to allow Persephone to return to her home. This the god atfirst refused to do, because Persephone had eaten of the pomegranate, the fruitof mortality. At last, however, he compromised and agreed to permit Persephoneto live in the upper world half of the year if she would stay with him in thedarkness of Hades for the remaining half.The Greeks believed that Persephone was a manifestation of the solar energy,which in the winter months lived under the earth with Pluto, but in the summerreturned again with the goddess of productiveness. There is a legend that theflowers loved Persephone and that every year when she left for the dark realmsof Pluto, the plants and shrubs would die of grief. While the profane anduninitiated had their own opinions on these subjects, the truths of the Greekallegories remained safely concealed by the priests, who alone recognized thesublimity of these great philosophic and religious parables.Thomas Taylor epitomizes the doctrines of the Greater Mysteries in the followingstatement: “The Greater (Mysteries) obscurely intimated, by mystic and splendidvisions, the felicity of the soul both here and hereafter when purified from thedefilement of a material nature, and constantly elevated to the realities ofintellectual (spiritual) vision.”Just as the Lesser Mysteries discussed the prenatal epoch of man when theconsciousness in its nine days (embry- ologically, months) was descending intothe realm of illusion and assuming the veil of unreality, so the GreaterMysteries discussed the principles of spiritual regeneration and revealed toinitiates not only the simplest but also the most direct and complete method ofliberating their higher natures from the bondage of material ignorance. LikePrometheus chained to the top of Mount Caucasus, man’s higher nature is chainedto his inadequate personality. The nine days of initiation were also symbolic ofthe nine spheres through which the human soul descends during the process ofassuming a terrestrial form. The secret exercises for spiritual unfoldment givento disciples of the higher degrees are unknown, but there is every reason tobelieve that they were similar to the Brahmanic Mysteries, since it is knownthat the Eleusinian ceremonies were closed with the Sanskrit words “Konx OmPax.”010 [images/00011.jpg] CERES, THE PATRON OF THE MYSTERIES.Ceres, or Demeter, was the daughter of Kronos and Rhea, and by Zeus the motherof Persephone. Some believe her to be the goddess of the earth, but morecorrectly she is the deity protecting agriculture in general and com inparticular. The poppy is sacred to Ceres and she is often shown carrying orornamented by a garland of these Hewers. In the Mysteries, Ceres is representedriding in a chariot drawn by winged serpents. That part of the allegory referring to the two six-month periods during one ofwhich Peresphone must remain with Pluto, while during the other she may revisitthe upper world, offers material for deep consideration. It is probable that theEleusinians realized that the soul left the body during sleep, or at least wasmade capable of leaving by the special training which undoubtedly they were in aposition to give. Thus Persephone would remain as the queen of Pluto’s realmduring the waking hours, but would ascend to the spiritual worlds during theperiods of sleep. The initiate was taught how to intercede with Pluto to permitPersephone (the initiate’s soul) to ascend from the darkness of his materialnature into the light of understanding. When thus freed from the shackles ofclay and crystallized concepts, the initiate was liberated not only for theperiod of his life but for all eternity, for never thereafter was he divested ofthose soul qualities which after death were his vehicles for manifestation andexpression in the so-called heaven world.In contrast to the idea of Hades as a state of darkness below, the gods weresaid to inhabit the tops of mountains, a well-known example being Mount Olympus,where the twelve deities of the Greek pantheon were said to dwell together. Inhis initiatory wanderings the neophyte therefore entered chambers ofever-increasing brilliancy to portray the ascent of the spirit from the lowerworlds into the realms of bliss. As the climax to such wanderings he entered agreat vaulted room, in the center of which stood a brilliantly illumined statueof the goddess Ceres. Here, in the presence of the hierophant and surrounded bypriests in magnificent robes, he was instructed in the highest of the secretmysteries of the Eleusis. At the conclusion of this ceremony he was hailed as anEpoptes, which means one who has beheld or seen directly. For this reason alsoinitiation was termed autopsy. The Epoptes was then given certain sacred books,probably written in cipher, together with tablets of stone on which secretinstructions were engraved.In The Obelisk in Freemasonry, John A. Weisse describes the officiatingpersonages of the Eleusinian Mysteries as consisting of a male and a femalehierophant who directed the initiations; a male and a female torchbearer; a maleherald; and a male and a female altar attendant. There were also numerous minorofficials. He states that, according to Porphyry, the hierophant representsPlato’s Demiurgus, or Creator of the world; the torch bearer, the Sun; the altarman, the Moon; the herald, Hermes, or Mercury; and the other officials, minorstars.From the records available, a number of strange and apparently supernaturalphenomena accompanied the rituals. Many initiates claim to have actually seenthe living gods themselves. Whether this was the result of religious ecstasy orthe actual cooperation of invisible powers with the visible priests must remaina mystery. In The Metamorphosis, or Golden Ass, Apuleius thus describes what inall probability is his initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries:“I approached to the confines of death, and having trod on the threshold ofProserpine I returned from it, being carried through all the elements. Atmidnight I saw the sun shining with a splendid light; and I manifestly drew nearto the gods beneath, and the gods above, and proximately adored them.”Women and children were admitted to the Eleusinian Mysteries, and at one timethere were literally thousands of initiates. Because this vast host was notprepared for the highest spiritual and mystical doctrines, a divisionnecessarily took place within the society itself. The higher teachings weregiven to only a limited number of initiates who, because of superior mentality,showed a comprehensive grasp of their underlying philosophical concepts.Socrates refused to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, for knowing itsprinciples without being a member of the order he realized that membership wouldseal his tongue. That the Mysteries of Eleusis were based upon great and eternaltruths is attested by the veneration in which they were held by the great mindsof the ancient world. M. Ouvaroff asks, “Would Pindar, Plato, Cicero, Epictetus,have spoken of them with such admiration, if the hierophant had satisfiedhimself with loudly proclaiming his own opinions, or those of his order?”The garments in which candidates were initiated were preserved for many yearsand were believed to possess almost sacred properties. Just as the soul can haveno covering save wisdom and virtue, so the candidates—being as yet without trueknowledge—were presented to the Mysteries unclothed, being first given the skinof an animal and later a consecrated robe to symbolize the philosophicalteachings received by the initiate. During the course of initiation thecandidate passed through two gates. The first led downward into the lower worldsand symbolized his birth into ignorance. The second led upward into a roombrilliantly lighted by unseen lamps, in which was the statue of Ceres and whichsymbolized the upper world, or the abode of Light and Truth. Strabo states thatthe great temple of Eleusis would hold between twenty and thirty thousandpeople. The caves dedicated by Zarathustra also had these two doors, symbolizingthe avenues of birth and death.The following paragraph from Porphyry gives a fairly adequate conception ofEleusinian symbolism: “God being a luminous principle, residing in the midst ofthe most subtile fire, he remains for ever invisible to the eyes of those who donot elevate themselves above material life: on this account, the sight oftransparent bodies, such as crystal, Parian marble, and even ivory, recalls theidea of divine light; as the sight of gold excites an idea of its purity, forgold cannot be sullied. Some have thought by a black stone was signified theinvisibility of the divine essence. To express supreme reason, the Divinity wasrepresented under the human form—and beautiful, for God is the source of beauty;of different ages, and in various attitudes, sitting or upright; of one or theother sex, as a virgin or a young man, a husband or a bride, that all the shadesand gradations might be marked. Every thing luminous was subsequently attributedto the gods; the sphere, and all that is spherical, to the universe, to the sunand the moon—sometimes to Fortune and to Hope. The circle, and all circularfigures, to eternity—to the celestial movements, to the circles and zones of theheavens. The section of circles, to the phases of the moon; and pyramids andobelisks, to the igneous principle, and through that to the gods of Heaven. Acone expresses the sun; a cylinder the earth; the phallus and triangle (a symbolof the matrix) designate generation.” (From Essay on the Mysteries of Eleusis byM. Ouvaroff.)The Eleusinian Mysteries, according to Heckethorn, survived all others and didnot cease to exist as an institution until nearly four hundred years afterChrist, when they were finally suppressed by Theodosius (styled the Great), whocruelly destroyed all who did not accept the Christian faith. Of this greatestof all philosophical institutions Cicero said that it taught men not only how tolive but also how to die."},{"pageContent":"THE ORPHIC MYSTERIES Orpheus, the Thracian bard, the great initiator of the Greeks, ceased to beknown as a man and was celebrated as a divinity several centuries before theChristian Era. “As to Orpheus himself* * *,” writes Thomas Taylor, “scarcely avestige of his life is to be found amongst the immense ruins of time. For whohas ever been able to affirm any thing with certainty of his origin, his age,his country, and condition? This alone may be depended on, from general assent,that there formerly lived a person named Orpheus, who was the founder oftheology among the Greeks; the institutor of their lives and morals; the firstof prophets, and the prince of poets; himself the offspring of a Muse; whotaught the Greeks their sacred rites and mysteries, and from whose wisdom, asfrom a perennial and abundant fountain, the divine muse of Homer and the sublimetheology of Pythagoras and Plato flowed.” (See The Mystical Hymns of Orpheus.)Orpheus was founder of the Grecian mythological system which he used as themedium for the promulgation of his philosophical doctrines. The origin of hisphilosophy is uncertain. He may have got it from the Brahmins, there beinglegends to the effect that he was a Hindu, his name possibly being derived fromρφναoς, meaning “dark.” Orpheus was initiated into the Egyptian Mysteries, fromwhich he secured extensive knowledge of magic, astrology, sorcery, and medicine.The Mysteries of the Cabiri at Samothrace were also conferred upon him, andthese undoubtedly contributed to his knowledge of medicine and music.The romance of Orpheus and Eurydice is one of the tragic episodes of Greekmythology and apparently constitutes the outstanding feature of the Orphic Rite.Eurydice, in her attempt to escape from a villain seeking to seduce her, diedfrom the venom of a poisonous serpent which stung her in the heel. Orpheus,penetrating to the very heart of the underworld, so charmed Pluto and Persephonewith the beauty of his music that they agreed to permit Eurydice to return tolife if Orpheus could lead her back to the sphere of the living without oncelooking round to see if she were following. So great was his fear, however, thatshe would stray from him that he turned his head, and Eurydice with aheartbroken cry was swept back into the land of death.Orpheus wandered the earth for a while disconsolate, and there are severalconflicting accounts of the manner of his death. Some declare that he was slainby a bolt of lightning; others, that failing to save his beloved Eurydice, hecommitted suicide. The generally accepted version of his death, however, is thathe was torn to pieces by Ciconian women whose advances he had spurned. In thetenth book of Plato’s Republic it is declared that, because of his sad fate atthe hands of women, the soul that had once been Orpheus, upon being destined tolive again in the physical world, chose rather to return in the body of a swanthan be born of woman. The head of Orpheus, after being torn from his body, wascast with his lyre into the river Hebrus, down which it floated to the sea,where, wedging in a cleft in a rock, it gave oracles for many years. The lyre,after being stolen from its shrine and working the destruction of the thief, waspicked up by the gods and fashioned into a constellation.Orpheus has long been sung as the patron of music. On his seven-stringed lyre heplayed such perfect harmonies that the gods themselves were moved to acclaim hispower. When he touched the strings of his instrument the birds and beastsgathered about him, and as he wandered through the forests his enchantingmelodies caused even the ancient trees with mighty effort to draw their gnarledroots from out the earth and follow him. Orpheus is one of the many Immortalswho have sacrificed themselves that mankind might have the wisdom of the gods.By the symbolism of his music he communicated the divine secrets to humanity,and several authors have declared that the gods, though loving him, feared thathe would overthrow their kingdom and therefore reluctantly encompassed hisdestruction.As time passed on the historical Orpheus became hopelessly confounded with thedoctrine he represented and eventually became the symbol of the Greek school ofthe ancient wisdom. Thus Orpheus was declared to be the son of Apollo, thedivine and perfect truth, and Calliope, the Muse of harmony and rhythm. In otherwords, Orpheus is the secret doctrine (Apollo) revealed through music(Calliope). Eurydice is humanity dead from the sting of the serpent of falseknowledge and imprisoned in the underworld of ignorance. In this allegoryOrpheus signifies theology, which wins her from the king of the dead but failsto accomplish her resurrection because it falsely estimates and mistrusts theinnate understanding within the human soul. The Ciconian women who tore Orpheuslimb from limb symbolize the various contending theological factions whichdestroy the body of Truth. They cannot accomplish this, however, until theirdiscordant cries drown out the harmony drawn by Orpheus from his magic lyre. Thehead of Orpheus signifies the esoteric doctrines of his cult. These doctrinescontinue to live and speak even after his body (the cult) has been destroyed.The lyre is the secret teaching of Orpheus; the seven strings are the sevendivine truths which are the keys to universal knowledge. The differing accountsof his death represent the various means used to destroy the secret teachings:wisdom can die in many ways at the same time. The allegory of Orpheusincarnating in the white swan merely signifies that the spiritual truths hepromulgated will continue and will be taught by the illumined initiates of allfuture ages. The swan is the symbol of the initiates of the Mysteries; it is asymbol also of the divine power which is the progenitor of the world."},{"pageContent":"THE BACCHIC AND DIONYSIAC RITES The Bacchic Rite centers around the allegory of the youthful Bacchus (Dionysosor Zagreus) being torn to pieces by the Titans. These giants accomplished thedestruction of Bacchus by causing him to become fascinated by his own image in amirror. After dismembering him, the Titans first boiled the pieces in water andafterwards roasted them. Pallas rescued the heart of the murdered god, and bythis precaution Bacchus (Dionysos) was enabled to spring forth again in all hisformer glory. Jupiter, the Demiurgus, beholding the crime of the Titans, hurledhis thunderbolts and slew them, burning their bodies to ashes with heavenlyfire. Out of the ashes of the Titans—which also contained a portion of the fleshof Bacchus, whose body they had partly devoured—the human race was created. Thusthe mundane life of every man was said to contain a portion of the Bacchic life.For this reason the Greek Mysteries warned against suicide. He who attempts todestroy himself raises his hand against the nature of Bacchus within him, sinceman’s body is indirectly the tomb of this god and consequently must be preservedwith the greatest care.Bacchus (Dionysos) represents the rational soul of the inferior world. He is thechief of the Titans—the artificers of the mundane spheres. The Pythagoreanscalled him the Titanic monad. Thus Bacchus is the all-inclusive idea of theTitanic sphere and the Titans—or gods of the fragments—the active agencies bymeans of which universal substance is fashioned into the pattern of this idea.The Bacchic state signifies the unity of the rational soul in a state ofself-knowledge, and the Titanic state the diversity of the rational soul which,being scattered throughout creation, loses the consciousness of its ownessential one-ness. The mirror into which Bacchus gazes and which is the causeof his fall is the great sea of Illusion—the lower world fashioned by theTitans. Bacchus (the mundane rational soul), seeing his image before him,accepts the image as a likeness of himself and ensouls the likeness; that is,the rational idea ensouls its reflection—the irrational universe. By ensoulingthe irrational image it implants in it the urge to become like its source, therational image. Therefore the ancients said that man does not know the gods bylogic or by reason but rather by realizing the presence of the gods withinhimself.After Bacchus gazed into the mirror and followed his own reflection into matter,the rational soul of the world was broken up and distributed by the Titansthroughout the mundane sphere of which it is the essential nature, but theheart, or source, of it they could not scatter. The Titans took the dismemberedbody of Bacchus and boiled it in water—symbol of immersion in the materialuniverse—which represents the incorporation of the Bacchic principle in form.The pieces were afterwards roasted to signify the subsequent ascension of thespiritual nature out of form.When Jupiter, the father of Bacchus and the Demiurgus of the universe, saw thatthe Titans were hopelessly involving the rational or divine idea by scatteringits members through the constituent parts of the lower world, he slew the Titansin order that the divine idea might not be entirely lost. From the ashes of theTitans he formed mankind, whose purpose of existence was to preserve andeventually to release the Bacchic idea, or rational soul, from the Titanicfabrication. Jupiter, being the Demiurgus and fabricator of the materialuniverse, is the third person of the Creative Triad, consequently the Lord ofDeath, for death exists only in the lower sphere of being over which hepresides. Disintegration takes place so that reintegration may follow upon ahigher level of form or intelligence. The thunderbolts of Jupiter are emblematicof his disintegrative power; they reveal the purpose of death, which is torescue the rational soul from the devouring power of the irrational nature.Man is a composite creature, his lower nature consisting of the fragments of theTitans and his higher nature the sacred, immortal flesh (life) of Bacchus.Therefore man is capable of either a Titanic (irrational) or a Bacchic(rational) existence. The Titans of Hesiod, who were twelve in number, areprobably analogous to the celestial zodiac, whereas the Titans who murdered anddismembered Bacchus represent the zodiacal powers distorted by their involvementin the material world. Thus Bacchus represents the sun who is dismembered by thesigns of the zodiac and from whose body the universe is formed. When theterrestrial forms were created from the various parts of his body the sense ofwholeness was lost and the sense of separateness established. The heart ofBacchus, which was saved by Pallas, or Minerva, was lifted out of the fourelements symbolized by his dismembered body and placed in the ether. The heartof Bacchus is the immortal center of the rational soul.After the rational soul had been distributed throughout creation and the natureof man, the Bacchic Mysteries were instituted for the purpose of disentanglingit from the irrational Titanic nature. This disentanglement was the process oflifting the soul out of the state of separateness into that of unity. Thevarious parts and members of Bacchus were collected from the different cornersof the earth. When all the rational parts are gathered Bacchus is resurrected.The Rites of Dionysos were very similar to those of Bacchus, and by many thesetwo gods are considered as one. Statues of Dionysos were carried in theEleusinian Mysteries, especially the lesser degrees. Bacchus, representing thesoul of the mundane sphere, was capable of an infinite multiplicity of form anddesignations. Dionysos apparently was his solar aspect.The Dionysiac Architects constituted an ancient secret society, in principlesand doctrines much like the modern Freemasonic Order. They were an organizationof builders bound together by their secret knowledge of the relationship betweenthe earthly and the divine sciences of architectonics. They were supposedlyemployed by King Solomon in the building of his Temple, although they were notJews, nor did they worship the God of the Jews, being followers of Bacchus andDionysos. The Dionysiac Architects erected many of the great monuments ofantiquity. They possessed a secret language and a system of marking theirstones. They had annual convocations and sacred feasts. The exact nature oftheir doctrines is unknown. It is believed that CHiram Abiff was an initiate ofthis society."},{"pageContent":"V Atlantis and the Gods of Antiquity Atlantis is the subject of a short but important article appearing in the AnnualReport of the Board of Regents of The Smithsonian Institution for the yearending June 30th, 1915. The author, M. Pierre Termier, a member of the Academyof Sciences and Director of Service of the Geologic Chart of France, in 1912delivered a lecture on the Atlantean hypothesis before the InstitutOcéanographique; it is the translated notes of this remarkable lecture that arepublished in the Smithsonian report.“After a long period of disdainful indifference,” writes M. Termier, “observehow in the last few years science is returning to the study of Atlantis. Howmany naturalists, geologists, zoologists, or botanists are asking one anothertoday whether Plato has not transmitted to us, with slight amplification, a pagefrom the actual history of mankind. No affirmation is yet permissible; but itseems more and more evident that a vast region, continental or made up of greatislands, has collapsed west of the Pillars of Hercules, otherwise called theStrait of Gibraltar, and that its collapse occurred in the not far distant past.In any event, the question of Atlantis is placed anew before men of science; andsince I do not believe that it can ever be solved without the aid ofoceanography, I have thought it natural to discuss it here, in this temple ofmaritime science, and to call to such a problem, long scorned but now beingrevived, the attention of oceanographers, as well as the attention of those who,though immersed in the tumult of cities, lend an ear to the distant murmur ofthe sea.”In his lecture M. Termier presents geologic, geographic, and zoologic data insubstantiation of the Atlantis theory. Figuratively draining the entire bed ofthe Atlantic Ocean, he considers the inequalities of its basin and citeslocations on a line from the Azores to Iceland where dredging has brought lavato the surface from a depth of 3,000 meters. The volcanic nature of the islandsnow existing in the Atlantic Ocean corroborates Plato’s statement that theAtlantean continent was destroyed by volcanic cataclysms. M. Termier alsoadvances the conclusions of a young French zoologist, M. Louis Germain, whoadmitted the existence of an Atlantic continent connected with the IberianPeninsula and with Mauritania and prolonged toward the south so as to includesome regions of desert climate. M. Termier concludes his lecture with a graphicpicture of the engulfment of that continent.The description of the Atlantean civilization given by Plato in the Critias maybe summarized as follows. In the first ages the gods divided the earth amongthemselves, proportioning it according to their respective dignities. Eachbecame the peculiar deity of his own allotment and established therein templesto himself, ordained a priestcraft, and instituted a system of sacrifice. ToPoseidon was given the sea and the island continent of Atlantis. In the midst ofthe island was a mountain which was the dwelling place of three earth-bornprimitive human beings—Evenor; his wife, Leucipe; and their only daughter,Cleito. The maiden was very beautiful, and after the sudden death of her parentsshe was wooed by Poseidon, who begat by her five pairs of male children.Poseidon apportioned his continent among these ten, and Atlas, the eldest, hemade overlord of the other nine. Poseidon further called the country Atlantisand the surrounding sea the Atlantic in honor of Atlas. Before the birth of histen sons, Poseidon divided the continent and the coastwise sea into concentriczones of land and water, which were as perfect as though turned upon a lathe.Two zones of land and three of water surrounded the central island, whichPoseidon caused to be irrigated with two springs of water—one warm and the othercold.The descendants of Atlas continued as rulers of Atlantis, and with wisegovernment and industry elevated the country to a position of surpassingdignity. The natural resources of Atlantis were apparently limitless. Preciousmetals were mined, wild animals domesticated, and perfumes distilled from itsfragrant flowers. While enjoying the abundance natural to their semitropiclocation, the Atlanteans employed themselves also in the erection of palaces,temples, and docks. They bridged the zones of sea and later dug a deep canal toconnect the outer ocean with the central island, where stood the palaces andtemple of Poseidon, which excelled all other structures in magnificence. Anetwork of bridges and canals was created by the Atlanteans to unite the variousparts of their kingdom.Plato then describes the white, black, and red stones which they quarried frombeneath their continent and used in the construction of public buildings anddocks. They circumscribed each of the land zones with a wall, the outer wallbeing covered with brass, the middle with tin, and the inner, which encompassedthe citadel, with orichalch. The citadel, on the central island, contained thepalaces, temples, and other public buildings. In its center, surrounded by awall of gold, was a sanctuary dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon. Here the firstten princes of the island were born and here each year their descendants broughtofferings. Poseidon’s own temple, its exterior entirely covered with silver andits pinnacles with gold, also stood within the citadel. The interior of thetemple was of ivory, gold, silver, and orichalch, even to the pillars and floor.The temple contained a colossal statue of Poseidon standing in a chariot drawnby six winged horses, about him a hundred Nereids riding on dolphins. Arrangedoutside the building were golden statues of the first ten kings and their wives.In the groves and gardens were hot and cold springs. There were numerous templesto various deities, places of exercise for men and for beasts, public baths, anda great race course for horses. At various vantage points on the zones werefortifications, and to the great harbor came vessels from every maritime nation.The zones were so thickly populated that the sound of human voices was ever inthe air.That part of Atlantis facing the sea was described as lofty and precipitous, butabout the central city was a plain sheltered by mountains renowned for theirsize, number, and beauty. The plain yielded two crops each year, in the winterbeing watered by rains and in the summer by immense irrigation canals, whichwere also used for transportation. The plain was divided into sections, and intime of war each section supplied its quota of fighting men and chariots.The ten governments differed from each other in details concerning militaryrequirements. Each of the kings of Atlantis had complete control over his ownkingdom, but their mutual relationships were governed by a code engraved by thefirst ten kings on a column of orichalch standing in the temple of Poseidon. Atalternate intervals of five and six years a pilgrimage was made to this templethat equal honor might be conferred upon both the odd and the even numbers.Here, with appropriate sacrifice, each king renewed his oath of loyalty upon thesacred inscription. Here also the kings donned azure robes and sat in judgment.At daybreak they wrote their sentences upon a golden tablet and deposited themwith their robes as memorials. The chief laws of the Atlantean kings were thatthey should not take up arms against each other and that they should come to theassistance of any of their number who was attacked. In matters of war and greatmoment the final decision was in the hands of the direct descendants of thefamily of Atlas. No king had the power of life and death over his kinsmenwithout the assent of a majority of the ten.Plato concludes his description by declaring that it was this great empire whichattacked the Hellenic states. This did not occur, however, until their power andglory had lured the Atlantean kings from the pathway of wisdom and virtue.Filled with false ambition, the rulers of Atlantis determined to conquer theentire world. Zeus, perceiving the wickedness of the Atlanteans, gathered thegods into his holy habitation and addressed them. Here Plato’s narrative comesto an abrupt end, for the Critias was never finished. In the Timœus is a furtherdescription of Atlantis, supposedly given to Solon by an Egyptian priest andwhich concludes as follows:“But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a singleday and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, andthe island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared, and was sunk beneath the sea.And that is the reason why the sea in those parts is impassable andimpenetrable, because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way; andthis was caused by the subsidence of the island.”In the introduction to his translation of the Timæus, Thomas Taylor quotes froma History of Ethiopia written by Marcellus, which contains the followingreference to Atlantis: “For they relate that in their time there were sevenislands in the Atlantic sea, sacred to Proserpine; and besides these, threeothers of an immense magnitude; one of which was sacred to Pluto, another toAmmon, and another, which is the middle of these, and is of a thousand stadia,to Neptune.” Crantor, commenting upon Plato, asserted that the Egyptian priestsdeclared the story of Atlantis to be written upon pillars which were stillpreserved circa 300 B.C. (See Beginnings or Glimpses of Vanished Civilizations.)Ignatius Donnelly, who gave the subject of Atlantis profound study, believedthat horses were first domesticated by the Atlanteans, for which reason theyhave always been considered peculiarly sacred to Poseidon. (See Atlantis.)From a careful consideration of Plato’s description of Atlantis it is evidentthat the story should not be regarded as wholly historical but rather as bothallegorical and historical. Origen, Porphyry, Proclus, Iamblichus, and Syrianusrealized that the story concealed a profound philosophical mystery, but theydisagreed as to the actual interpretation. Plato’s Atlantis symbolizes thethreefold nature of both the universe and the human body. The ten kings ofAtlantis are the tetractys, or numbers, which are born as five pairs ofopposites. (Consult Theon of Smyrna for the Pythagorean doctrine of opposites.)The numbers 1 to 10 rule every creature, and the numbers, in turn, are under thecontrol of the Monad, or 1—the Eldest among them.With the trident scepter of Poseidon these kings held sway over the inhabitantsof the seven small and three great islands comprising Atlantis. Philosophically,the ten islands symbolize the triune powers of the Superior Deity and the sevenregents who bow before His eternal throne. If Atlantis be considered as thearchetypal sphere, then its immersion signifies the descent of rational,organized consciousness into the illusionary, impermanent realm of irrational,mortal ignorance. Both the sinking of Atlantis and the Biblical story of the“fall of man” signify spiritual involution—a prerequisite to consciousevolution.Either the initiated Plato used the Atlantis allegory to achieve two widelydifferent ends or else the accounts preserved by the Egyptian priests weretampered with to perpetuate the secret doctrine. This does not mean to implythat Atlantis is purely mythological, but it overcomes the most serious obstacleto acceptance of the Atlantis theory, namely, the fantastic accounts of itsorigin, size, appearance, and date of destruction—9600 B.C. In the midst of thecentral island of Atlantis was a lofty mountain which cast a shadow fivethousand stadia in extent and whose summit touched the sphere of œther. This isthe axle mountain of the world, sacred among many races and symbolic of thehuman head, which rises out of the four elements of the body. This sacredmountain, upon whose summit stood the temple of the gods, gave rise to thestories of Olympus, Meru, and Asgard. The City of the Golden Gates—the capitalof Atlantis—is the one now preserved among numerous religions as the City of theGods or the Holy City. Here is the archetype of the New Jerusalem, with itsstreets paved with gold and its twelve gates shining with precious stones.“The history of Atlantis,” writes Ignatius Donnelly, “is the key of the Greekmythology. There can be no question that these gods of Greece were human beings.The tendency to attach divine attributes to great earthly rulers is one deeplyimplanted in human nature.” (See Atlantis.)The same author sustains his views by noting that the deities of the Greekpantheon were not looked upon as creators of the universe but rather as regentsset over it by its more ancient original fabricators. The Garden of Eden fromwhich humanity was driven by a flaming sword is perhaps an allusion to theearthly paradise supposedly located west of the Pillars of Hercules anddestroyed by volcanic cataclysms. The Deluge legend may be traced also to theAtlantean inundation, during which a “world” was destroyed by water.Was the religious, philosophic, and scientific knowledge possessed by thepriestcrafts of antiquity secured from Atlantis, whose submergence obliteratedevery vestige of its part in the drama of world progress? Atlantean sun worshiphas been perpetuated in the ritualism and ceremonialism of both Christianity andpagandom. Both the cross and the serpent were Atlantean emblems of divinewisdom. The divine (Atlantean) progenitors of the Mayas and Quichés of CentralAmerica coexisted within the green and azure radiance of Gucumatz, the “plumed”serpent. The six sky-born sages came into manifestation as centers of lightbound together or synthesized by the seventh—and chief—of their order, the“feathered” snake. (See the Popol Vuh.) The title of “winged” or “plumed” snakewas applied to Quetzalcoatl, or Kukulcan, the Central American initiate. Thecenter of the Atlantean Wisdom-Religion was presumably a great pyramidal templestanding on the brow of a plateau rising in the midst of the City of the GoldenGates. From here the Initiate-Priests of the Sacred Feather went forth, carryingthe keys of Universal Wisdom to the uttermost parts of the earth.The mythologies of many nations contain accounts of gods who “came out of thesea.” Certain shamans among the American Indians tell of holy men dressed inbirds’ feathers and wampum who rose out of the blue waters and instructed themin the arts and crafts. Among the legends of the Chaldeans is that of Oannes, apartly amphibious creature who came out of the sea and taught the savage peoplesalong the shore to read and write, till the soil, cultivate herbs for healing,study the stars, establish rational forms of government, and become conversantwith the sacred Mysteries. Among the Mayas, Quetzalcoatl, the Savior-God (whomsome Christian scholars believe to have been St. Thomas), issued from the watersand, after instructing the people in the essentials of civilization, rode out tosea on a magic raft of serpents to escape the wrath of the fierce god of theFiery Mirror, Tezcatlipoca.May it not have been that these demigods of a fabulous age who, Esdras- like,came out of the sea were Atlantean priests? All that primitive man remembered ofthe Atlanteans was the glory of their golden ornaments, the transcendency oftheir wisdom, and the sanctity of their symbols—the cross and the serpent. Thatthey came in ships was soon forgotten, for untutored minds considered even boatsas supernatural. Wherever the Atlanteans proselyted they erected pyramids andtemples patterned after the great sanctuary in the City of the Golden Gates.Such is the origin of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, and Central America. Themounds in Normandy and Britain, as well as those of the American Indians, areremnants of a similar culture. In the midst of the Atlantean program of worldcolonization and conversion, the cataclysms which sank Atlantis began. TheInitiate-Priests of the Sacred Feather who promised to come back to theirmissionary settlements never returned; and after the lapse of centuriestradition preserved only a fantastic account of gods who came from a place wherethe sea now is.H. P. Blavatsky thus sums up the causes which precipitated the Atlanteandisaster: “Under the evil insinuations of their demon, Thevetat, theAtlantis-race became a nation of wicked magicians. In consequence of this, warwas declared, the story of which would be too long to narrate; its substance maybe found in the disfigured allegories of the race of Cain, the giants, and thatof Noah and his righteous family. The conflict came to an end by the submersionof the Atlantis; which finds its imitation in the stories of the Babylonian andMosaic flood: The giants and magicians ‘* * * and all flesh died * * * and everyman.’ All except Xisuthrus and Noah, who are substantially identical with thegreat Father of the Thlinkithians in the Popol Vuh, or the sacred book of theGuatemaleans, which also tells of his escaping in a large boat, like the HinduNoah—Vaiswasvata.” (See Isis Unveiled.)From the Atlanteans the world has received not only the heritage of arts andcrafts, philosophies, and sciences, ethics and religions, but also the heritageof hate, strife, and perversion. The Atlanteans instigated the first war; and ithas been said that all subsequent wars were fought in a fruitless effort tojustify the first one and right the wrong which it caused. Before Atlantis sank,its spiritually illumined Initiates, who realized that their land was doomedbecause it had departed from the Path of Light, withdrew from the ill-fatedcontinent. Carrying with them the sacred and secret doctrine, these Atlanteansestablished themselves in Egypt, where they became its first “divine” rulers.Nearly all the great cosmologic myths forming the foundation of the varioussacred books of the world are based upon the Atlantean Mystery rituals."},{"pageContent":"THE MYTH OF THE DYING GOD The myth of Tammuz and Ishtar is one of the earliest examples of the dying-godallegory, probably antedating 4000 B.C. (See Babylonia and Assyria by LewisSpence.) The imperfect condition of the tablets upon which the legends areinscribed makes it impossible to secure more than a fragmentary account of theTammuz rites. Being the esoteric god of the sun, Tammuz did not occupy aposition among the first deities venerated by the Babylonians, who for lack ofdeeper knowledge looked upon him as a god of agriculture or a vegetation spirit.Originally he was described as being one of the guardians of the gates of theunderworld. Like many other Savior-Gods, he is referred to as a “shepherd” or“the lord of the shepherd seat.” Tammuz occupies the remarkable position of sonand husband of Ishtar, the Babylonian and Assyrian Mother-goddess. Ishtar—towhom the planet Venus was sacred—was the most widely venerated deity of theBabylonian and Assyrian pantheon. She was probably identical with Ashteroth,Astarte, and Aphrodite. The story of her descent into the underworld in searchpresumably for the sacred elixir which alone could restore Tammuz to life is thekey to the ritual of her Mysteries. Tammuz, whose annual festival took placejust before the summer solstice, died in midsummer in the ancient month whichbore his name, and was mourned with elaborate ceremonies. The manner of hisdeath is unknown, but some of the accusations made against Ishtar by Izdubar(Nimrod) would indicate that she, indirectly at least, had contributed to hisdemise. The resurrection of Tammuz was the occasion of great rejoicing, at whichtime he was hailed as a “redeemer” of his people.With outspread wings, Ishtar, the daughter of Sin (the Moon), sweeps downward tothe gates of death. The house of darkness—the dwelling of the god Irkalla—isdescribed as “the place of no return.” It is without light; the nourishment ofthose who dwell therein is dust and their food is mud. Over the bolts on thedoor of the house of Irkalla is scattered dust, and the keepers of the house arecovered with feathers like birds. Ishtar demands that the keepers open thegates, declaring that if they do not she will shatter the doorposts and strikethe hinges and raise up dead devourers of the living. The guardians of the gatesbeg her to be patient while they go to the queen of Hades from whom they securepermission to admit Ishtar, but only in the same manner as all others came tothis dreary house. Ishtar thereupon descends through the seven gates which leaddownward into the depths of the underworld. At the first gate the great crown isremoved from her head, at the second gate the earrings from her ears, at thethird gate the necklace from her neck, at the fourth gate the ornaments from herbreast, at the fifth gate the girdle from her waist, at the sixth gate thebracelets from her hands and feet, and at the seventh gate the covering cloak ofher body. Ishtar remonstrates as each successive article of apparel is takenfrom her, but the guardian tells her that this is the experience of all whoenter the somber domain of death. Enraged upon beholding Ishtar, the Mistress ofHades inflicts upon her all manner of disease and imprisons her in theunderworld.As Ishtar represents the spirit of fertility, her loss prevents the ripening ofthe crops and the maturing of all life upon the earth. In this respect the storyparallels the legend of Persephone. The gods, realizing that the loss of Ishtaris disorganizing all Nature, send a messenger to the underworld and demand herrelease. The Mistress of Hades is forced to comply, and the water of life ispoured over Ishtar. Thus cured of the infirmities inflicted on her, she retracesher way upward through the seven gates, at each of which she is reinvested withthe article of apparel which the guardians had removed. (See The ChaldeanAccount of Genesis.) No record exists that Ishtar secured the water of lifewhich would have wrought the resurrection of Tammuz.The myth of Ishtar symbolizes the descent of the human spirit through the sevenworlds, or spheres of the sacred planets, until finally, deprived of itsspiritual adornments, it incarnates in the physical body—Hades—where themistress of that body heaps every form of sorrow and misery upon the imprisonedconsciousness. The waters of life—the secret doctrine—cure the diseases ofignorance; and the spirit, ascending again to its divine source, regains itsGod-given adornments as it passes upward through the rings of the planets.Another Mystery ritual among the Babylonians and Assyrians was that of Merodachand the Dragon. Merodach, the creator of the inferior universe, slays a horriblemonster and out of her body forms the universe. Here is the probable source ofthe so-called Christian allegory of St. George and the Dragon.The Mysteries of Adonis, or Adoni, were celebrated annually in many parts ofEgypt, Phœnicia, and Biblos. The name Adonis, or Adoni, means “Lord” and was adesignation applied to the sun and later borrowed by the Jews as the exotericname of their God. Smyrna, mother of Adonis, was turned into a tree by the godsand after a time the bark burst open and the infant Savior issued forth.According to one account, he was liberated by a wild boar which split the woodof the maternal tree with its tusks. Adonis was born at midnight of the 24th ofDecember, and through his unhappy death a Mystery rite was established thatwrought the salvation of his people. In the Jewish month of Tammuz (another namefor this deity) he was gored to death by a wild boar sent by the god Ares(Mars). The Adoniasmos was the ceremony of lamenting the premature death of themurdered god.In Ezekiel viii. 14, it is written that women were weeping for Tammuz (Adonis)at the north gate of the Lord’s House in Jerusalem. Sir James George Frazercites Jerome thus: “He tells us that Bethlehem, the traditionary birthplace ofthe Lord, was shaded by a grove of that still older Syrian Lord, Adonis, andthat where the infant Jesus had wept, the lover of Venus was bewailed.” (See TheGolden Bough.) The effigy of a wild boar is said to have been set over one ofthe gates of Jerusalem in honor of Adonis, and his rites celebrated in thegrotto of the Nativity at Bethlehem. Adonis as the “gored” (or “god”) man is oneof the keys to Sir Francis Bacon’s use of the “wild boar” in his crypticsymbolism.Adonis was originally an androgynous deity who represented the solar power whichin the winter was destroyed by the evil principle of cold—the boar. After threedays (months) in the tomb, Adonis rose triumphant on the 25th day of March,amidst the acclamation of his priests and followers, “He is risen!” Adonis wasborn out of a myrrh tree. Myrrh, the symbol of death because of its connectionwith the process of embalming, was one of the gifts brought by the three Magi tothe manger of Jesus.In the Mysteries of Adonis the neophyte passed through the symbolic death of thegod and, “raised” by the priests, entered into the blessed state of redemptionmade possible by the sufferings of Adonis. Nearly all authors believe Adonis tohave been originally a vegetation god directly connected with the growth andmaturing of flowers and fruits. In support of this viewpoint they describe the“gardens of Adonis,” which were small baskets of earth in which seeds wereplanted and nurtured for a period of eight days. When those plants prematurelydied for lack of sufficient earth, they were considered emblematic of themurdered Adonis and were usually cast into the sea with images of the god.In Phrygia there existed a remarkable school of religious philosophy whichcentered around the life and untimely fate of another Savior-God known as Atys,or Attis, by many considered synonymous with Adonis. This deity was born atmidnight on the 24th day of December. Of his death there are two accounts. Inone he was gored to death like Adonis; in the other he emasculated himself undera pine tree and there died. His body was taken to a cave by the Great Mother(Cybele), where it remained through the ages without decaying. To the rites ofAtys the modern world is indebted for the symbolism of the Christmas tree. Atysimparted his immortality to the tree beneath which he died, and Cybele took thetree with her when she removed the body. Atys remained three days in the tomb,rose upon a date corresponding with Easter morn, and by this resurrectionovercame death for all who were initiated into his Mysteries.“In the Mysteries of the Phrygians,” says Julius Firmicus, “which are calledthose of the MOTHER OF THE GODS, every year a PINE TREE is cut down and in theinside of the tree the image of a YOUTH is tied in! In the Mysteries of Isis thetrunk of a PINE TREE is cut: the middle of the trunk is nicely hollowed out; theidol of Osiris made from those hollowed pieces is BURIED. In the Mysteries ofProserpine a tree cut is put together into the effigy and form of the VIRGIN,and when it has been carried within the city it is MOURNED 40 nights, but thefortieth night it is BURNED!” (See Sod, the Mysteries of Adoni.)The Mysteries of Atys included a sacramental meal during which the neophyte ateout of a drum and drank from a cymbal. After being baptized by the blood of abull, the new initiate was fed entirely on milk to symbolize that he was still aphilosophical infant, having but recently been born out of the sphere ofmateriality. (See Frazer’s The Golden Bough.) Is there a possible connectionbetween this lacteal diet prescribed by the Attic rite and St. Paul’s allusionto the food for spiritual babes? Sallust gives a key to the esotericinterpretation of the Attic rituals. Cybele, the Great Mother, signifies thevivifying powers of the universe, and Atys that aspect of the spiritualintellect which is suspended between the divine and animal spheres. The Motherof the gods, loving Atys, gave him a starry hat, signifying celestial powers,but Atys (mankind), falling in love with a nymph (symbolic of the lower animalpropensities), forfeited his divinity and lost his creative powers. It is thusevident that Atys represents the human consciousness and that his Mysteries areconcerned with the reattainment of the starry hat. (See Sallust on the Gods andthe World.)The rites of Sabazius were very similar to those of Bacchus and it is generallybelieved that the two deities are identical. Bacchus was born at Sabazius, orSabaoth, and these names are frequently assigned to him. The Sabazian Mysterieswere performed at night, and the ritual included the drawing of a live snakeacross the breast of the candidate. Clement of Alexandria writes: “The token ofthe Sabazian Mysteries to the initiated is ‘the deity gliding over the breast.’”A golden serpent was the symbol of Sabazius because this deity represented theannual renovation of the world by the solar power. The Jews borrowed the nameSabaoth from these Mysteries and adopted it as one of the appellations of theirsupreme God. During the time the Sabazian Mysteries were celebrated in Rome, thecult gained many votaries and later influenced the symbolism of Christianity.The Cabiric Mysteries of Samothrace were renowned among the ancients, being nextto the Eleusinian in public esteem. Herodotus declares that the Samothraciansreceived their doctrines, especially those concerning Mercury, from thePelasgians. Little is known concerning the Cabiric rituals, for they wereenshrouded in the profoundest secrecy. Some regard the Cabiri as seven in numberand refer to them as “the Seven Spirits of fire before the throne of Saturn.”Others believe the Cabiri to be the seven sacred wanderers, later called theplanets.While a vast number of deities are associated with the Samothracian Mysteries,the ritualistic drama centers around four brothers. The first three—Aschieros,Achiochersus, and Achiochersa—attack and murder the fourth—Cashmala (orCadmillus). Dionysidorus, however, identifies Aschieros with Demeter,Achiochersus with Pluto, Achiochersa with Persephone, and Cashmala with Hermes.Alexander Wilder notes that in the Samothracian ritual “Cadmillus is made toinclude the Theban Serpent-god, Cadmus, the Thoth of Egypt, the Hermes of theGreeks, and the Emeph or Æsculapius of the Alexandrians and Phœnicians.” Hereagain is a repetition of the story of Osiris, Bacchus, Adonis, Balder, and HiramAbiff. The worship of Atys and Cybele was also involved in the SamothracianMysteries. In the rituals of the Cabiri is to be traced a form of pinetreeworship, for this tree, sacred to Atys, was first trimmed into the form of across and then cut down in honor of the murdered god whose body was discoveredat its foot.“If you wish to inspect the orgies of the Corybantes,” writes Clement, “thenknow that, having killed their third brother, they covered the head of the deadbody with a purple cloth, crowned it, and carrying it on the point of a spear,buried it under the roots of Olympus. These mysteries are, in short, murders andfunerals. [This ante-Nicene Father in his efforts to defame the pagan ritesapparently ignores the fact that, like the Cabirian martyr, Jesus Christ wasfoully betrayed, tortured, and finally murdered!] And the priests of theserites, who are called kings of the sacred rites by those whose business it is toname them, give additional strangeness to the tragic occurrence, by forbiddingparsley with the roots from being placed on the table, for they think thatparsley grew from the Corybantic blood that flowed forth;just as the women, incelebrating the Thes- mophoria, abstain from eating the seeds of thepomegranate, which have fallen on the ground, from the idea that pomegranatessprang from the drops of the blood of Dionysus. Those Corybantes also they callCabiric; and the ceremony itself they announce as the Cabiric mystery.”The Mysteries of the Cabiri were divided into three degrees, the first of whichcelebrated the death of Cashmala at the hands of his three brothers; the second,the discovery of his mutilated body, the parts of which had been found andgathered after much labor; and the third—accompanied by great rejoicing andhappiness—his resurrection and the consequent salvation of the world. The templeof the Cabiri at Samothrace contained a number of curious divinities, many ofthem misshapen creatures representing the elemental powers of Nature, possiblythe Bacchic Titans. Children were initiated into the Cabirian cult with the samedignity as adults, and criminals who reached the sanctuary were safe frompursuit. The Samothracian rites were particularly concerned with navigation, theDioscuri—Castor and Pollux, or the gods of navigation—being among thosepropitiated by members of that cult. The Argonautic expedition, listening to theadvice of Orpheus, stopped at the island of Samothrace for the purpose of havingits members initiated into the Cabiric rites.Herodotus relates that when Cambyses entered the temple of the Cabiri he wasunable to restrain his mirth at seeing before him the figure of a man standingupright and, facing the man, the figure of a woman standing on her head. HadCambyses been acquainted with the principles of divine astronomy, he would haverealized that he was then in the presence of the key to universal equilibrium.“‘I ask,’ says Voltaire, ‘who were these Hierophants, these sacred Freemasons,who celebrated their Ancient Mysteries of Samothracia, and whence came they andtheir gods Cabiri?’” (See Mackey’s Encyclopædia of Freemasonry.) Clement speaksof the Mysteries of the Cabiri as “the sacred mystery of a brother slain by hisbrethren,” and the “Cabiric death” was one of the secret symbols of antiquity.Thus the allegory of the Self murdered by the not-self is perpetuated throughthe religious mysticism of all peoples. The philosophic death and thephilosophic resurrection are the Lesser and the Greater Mysteries respectively.A curious aspect of the dying-god myth is that of the Hanged Man. The mostimportant example of this peculiar conception is found in the Odinic ritualswhere Odin hangs himself for nine nights from the branches of the World Tree andupon the same occasion also pierces his own side with the sacred spear. As theresult of this great sacrifice, Odin, while suspended over the depths ofNifl-heim, discovered by meditation the runes or alphabets by which later therecords of his people were preserved. Because of this remarkable experience,Odin is sometimes shown seated on a gallows tree and he became the patron deityof all who died by the noose. Esoterically, the Hanged Man is the human spiritwhich is suspended from heaven by a single thread. Wisdom, not death, is thereward for this voluntary sacrifice during which the human soul, suspended abovethe world of illusion, and meditating upon its unreality, is rewarded by theachievement of self-realization.From a consideration of all these ancient and secret rituals it becomes evidentthat the mystery of the dying god was universal among the illumined andvenerated colleges of the sacred teaching. This mystery has been perpetuated inChristianity in the crucifixion and death of the God-man—Jesus the Christ. Thesecret import of this world tragedy and the Universal Martyr must berediscovered if Christianity is to reach the heights attained by the pagans inthe days of their philosophic supremacy. The myth of the dying god is the key toboth universal and individual redemption and regeneration, and those who do notcomprehend the true nature of this supreme allegory are not privileged toconsider themselves either wise or truly religious."},{"pageContent":"VI The Life and Writings of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus Thunder rolled, lightning flashed, the veil of the Temple was rent from top tobottom. The venerable initiator, in his robes of blue and gold, slowly raisedhis jeweled wand and pointed with it into the darkness revealed by the tearingof the silken curtain: “Behold the Light of Egypt!” The candidate, in his plainwhite robe, gazed into the utter blackness framed by the two great lotus-headedcolumns between which the veil had hung. As he watched, a luminous hazedistributed itself throughout the atmosphere until the air was a mass of shiningparticles. The face of the neophyte was illumined by the soft glow as he scannedthe shimmering cloud for some tangible object. The initiator spoke again: “ThisLight which ye behold is the secret luminance of the Mysteries. Whence it comesnone knoweth, save the ‘Master of the Light.’ Behold Him!” Suddenly, through thegleaming mist a figure appeared, surrounded by a flickering greenish sheen. Theinitiator lowered his wand and, bowing his head, placed one hand edgewiseagainst his breast in humble salutation. The neophyte stepped back in awe,partly blinded by the glory of the revealed figure. Gaining courage, the youthgazed again at the Divine One. The Form before him was considerably larger thanthat of a mortal man. The body seemed partly transparent so that the heart andbrain could be seen pulsating and radiant. As the candidate watched, the heartchanged into an ibis, and the brain into a flashing emerald. In Its hand thismysterious Being bore a winged rod, entwined with serpents. The aged initiator,raising his wand, cried out in a loud voice: “All hail Thee, Thoth Hermes,Thrice Greatest; all hail Thee, Prince of Men; all hail Thee who standeth uponthe head of Typhon!” At the same instant a lurid writhing dragon appeared—ahideous monster, part serpent, part crocodile, and part hog. From its mouth andnostrils poured sheets of flame and horrible sounds echoed through the vaultedchambers. Suddenly Hermes struck the advancing reptile with the serpent-woundstaff and with snarling cry the dragon fell over upon its side, while the flamesabout it slowly died away. Hermes placed His foot upon the skull of thevanquished Typhon. The next instant, with a blaze of unbearable glory that sentthe neophyte staggering backward against a pillar, the immortal Hermes, followedby streamers of greenish mist, passed through the chamber and faded intonothingness.011 [images/00012.jpg] HERMES MERCURIUS TRISMEGISTUS.Master of all arts and sciences, perfect in all crafts. Ruler of the ThreeWorlds, Scribe of the Gods, and Keeper of the Books of Life, Thoth HermesTrismegistus—the Three Times Greatest, the “First Intelligencer”—was regarded bythe ancient Egyptians as the embodiment of the Universal Mind. While in allprobability there actually existed a great sage and educator by the name ofHermes, it is impossible to extricate the historical man from the mass oflegendary accounts which attempt to identify him with the Cosmic Principle ofThought."},{"pageContent":"SUPPOSITIONS CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF HERMES Iamblichus averred that Hermes was the author of twenty thousand books; Manethoincreased the number to more than thirty-six thousand (see JamesGardner)—figures which make it evident that a solitary individual, even thoughhe be overshadowed by divine prerogative, could scarcely have accomplished sucha monumental labor. Among the arts and sciences which it is affirmed Hermesrevealed to mankind were medicine, chemistry, law, art, astrology, music,rhetoric, magic, philosophy, geography, mathematics (especially geometry),anatomy, and oratory. Orpheus was similarly acclaimed by the Greeks.In his Biographia Antiqua, Francis Barrett says of Hermes: “* * * if God everappeared in man, he appeared in him, as is evident both from his books and hisPymander; in which works he has communicated the sum of the Abyss, and thedivine knowledge to all posterity; by which he has demonstrated himself to havebeen not only an inspired divine, but also a deep philosopher, obtaining hiswisdom from God and heavenly things, and not from man.”His transcendent learning caused Hermes to be identified with many of the earlysages and prophets. In his Ancient Mythology, Bryant writes: “I have mentionedthat Cadmus was the same as the Egyptian Thoth; and it is manifest from hisbeing Hermes, and from the invention of letters being attributed to him.” (Inthe chapter on the theory of Pythagorean Mathematics will be found the table ofthe original Cadmean letters.) Investigators believe that it was Hermes who wasknown to the Jews as “Enoch,” called by Kenealy the “Second Messenger of God.”Hermes was accepted into the mythology of the Greeks, later becoming the Mercuryof the Latins. He was revered through the form of the planet Mercury becausethis body is nearest to the sun: Hermes of all creatures was nearest to God, andbecame known as the Messenger of the Gods.In the Egyptian drawings of him, Thoth carries a waxen writing tablet and servesas the recorder during the weighing of the souls of the dead in the JudgmentHall of Osiris—a ritual of great significance. Hermes is of first importance toMasonic scholars, because he was the author of the Masonic initiatory rituals,which were borrowed from the Mysteries established by Hermes. Nearly all of theMasonic symbols are Hermetic in character. Pythagoras studied mathematics withthe Egyptians and from them gained his knowledge of the symbolic geometricsolids. Hermes is also revered for his reformation of the calendar system. Heincreased the year from 360 to 365 days, thus establishing a precedent whichstill prevails. The appellation “Thrice Greatest” was given to Hermes because hewas considered the greatest of all philosophers, the greatest of all priests,and the greatest of all kings. It is worthy of note that the last poem ofAmerica’s beloved poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was a lyric ode to Hermes.(See Chambers’ Encyclopædia.)"},{"pageContent":"THE MUTITATED HERMETIC FRAGMENTS On the subject of the Hermetic books, James Campbell Brown, in his History ofChemistry, has written: “Leaving the Chaldean and earliest Egyptian periods, ofwhich we have remains but no record, and from which no names of either chemistsor philosophers have come down to us, we now approach the Historic Period, whenbooks were written, not at first upon parchment or paper, but upon papyrus. Aseries of early Egyptian books is attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, who mayhave been a real savant, or may be a personification of a long succession ofwriters. * * * He is identified by some with the Greek god Hermes, and theEgyptian Thoth or Tuti, who was the moon-god, and is represented in ancientpaintings as ibis-headed with the disc and crescent of the moon. The Egyptiansregarded him as the god of wisdom, letters, and the recording of time. It is inconsequence of the great respect entertained for Hermes by the old alchemiststhat chemical writings were called ‘hermetic,’ and that the phrase ‘hermeticallysealed’ is still in use to designate the closing of a glass vessel by fusion,after the manner of chemical manipulators. We find the same root in the hermeticmedicines of Paracelsus, and the hermetic freemasonry of the Middle Ages.”Among the fragmentary writings believed to have come from the stylus of Hermesare two famous works. The first is the Emerald Table, and the second is theDivine Pymander, or, as it is more commonly called, The Shepherd of Men, adiscussion of which follows. One outstanding point in connection with Hermes isthat he was one of the few philosopher-priests of pagandom upon whom the earlyChristians did not vent their spleen. Some Church Fathers went so far as todeclare that Hermes exhibited many symptoms of intelligence, and that if he hadonly been born in a more enlightened age so that he might have benefited bytheir instructions he would have been a really great man!In his Stromata, Clement of Alexandria, one of the few chroniclers of pagan lorewhose writings have been preserved to this age, gives practically all theinformation that is known concerning the original forty-two books of Hermes andthe importance with which these books were regarded by both the temporal andspiritual powers of Egypt. Clement describes one of their ceremonial processionsas follows:“For the Egyptians pursue a philosophy of their own. This is principally shownby their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one ofthe symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books ofHermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second theregulations for the king’s life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer,with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must havethe astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.Of these, one is about the order of the fixed stars that are visible, andanother about the conjunctions and luminous appearances of the sun and moon; andthe rest respecting their risings. Next in order advances the sacred Scribe,with wings on his head, and in his hand a book and rule, in which were writingink and the reed, with which they write. And he must be acquainted with what arecalled hieroglyphics, and know about cosmography and geography, the position ofthe sun and moon, and about the five planets; also the description of Egypt, andthe chart of the Nile; and the description of the equipment of the priests andof the place consecrated to them, and about the measures and the things in usein the sacred rites. Then the Stole-keeper follows those previously mentioned,with the cubit of justice and the cup for libations. He is acquainted with allpoints called Pædeutic (relating to training) and Moschophaltic (sacrificial).There are also ten books which relate to the honour paid by them to their gods,and containing the Egyptian worship; as that relating to sacrifices,first-fruits, hymns, prayers, processions, festivals, and the like. And behindall walks the Prophet, with the water-vase carried openly in his arms; who isfollowed by those who carry the issue of loaves. He, as being the governor ofthe temple, learns the ten books called ‘Hieratic’; and they contain all aboutthe laws, and the gods, and the whole of the training of the priests. For theProphet is, among the Egyptians, also over the distribution of the revenues.There are then forty-two books of Hermes indispensably necessary; of which thesix-and-thirty containing the whole philosophy of the Egyptians are learned bythe forementioned personages; and the other six, which are medical, by thePastophoroi (image-bearers), —treating of the structure of the body, and ofdiseases, and instruments, and medicines, and about the eyes, and the last aboutwomen.”One of the greatest tragedies of the philosophic world was the loss of nearlyall of the forty-two books of Hermes mentioned in the foregoing. These booksdisappeared during the burning of Alexandria, for the Romans—and later theChristians—realized that until these books were eliminated they could neverbring the Egyptians into subjection. The volumes which escaped the fire wereburied in the desert and their location is now known to only a few initiates ofthe secret schools."},{"pageContent":"THE BOOK OF THOTH While Hermes still walked the earth with men, he entrusted to his chosensuccessors the sacred Book of Thoth. This work contained the secret processes bywhich the regeneration of humanity was to be accomplished and also served as thekey to his other writings. Nothing definite is known concerning the contents ofthe Book of Thoth other than that its pages were covered with strangehieroglyphic figures and symbols, which gave to those acquainted with their useunlimited power over the spirits of the air and the subterranean divinities.When certain areas of the brain are stimulated by the secret processes of theMysteries, the consciousness of man is extended and he is permitted to beholdthe Immortals and enter into the presence of the superior gods. The Book ofThoth described the method whereby this stimulation was accomplished. In truth,therefore, it was the “Key to Immortality.”According to legend, the Book of Thoth was kept in a golden box in the innersanctuary of the temple. There was but one key and this was in the possession ofthe “Master of the Mysteries,” the highest initiate of the Hermetic Arcanum. Healone knew what was written in the secret book. The Book of Thoth was lost tothe ancient world with the decay of the Mysteries, but its faithful initiatescarried it sealed in the sacred casket into another land. The book is still inexistence and continues to lead the disciples of this age into the presence ofthe Immortals. No other information can be given to the world concerning it now,but the apostolic succession from the first hierophant initiated by Hermeshimself remains unbroken to this day, and those who are peculiarly fitted toserve the Immortals may discover this priceless document if they will searchsincerely and tirelessly for it.It has been asserted that the Book of Thoth is, in reality, the mysterious Tarotof the Bohemians—a strange emblematic book of seventy-eight leaves which hasbeen in possession of the gypsies since the time when they were driven fromtheir ancient temple, the Serapeum. (According to the Secret Histories thegypsies were originally Egyptian priests.) There are now in the world severalsecret schools privileged to initiate candidates into the Mysteries, but innearly every instance they lighted their altar fires from the flaming torch ofHerm. Hermes in his Book of Thoth revealed to all mankind the “One Way,” and forages the wise of every nation and every faith have reached immortality by the“Way” established by Hermes in the midst of the darkness for the redemption ofhumankind.012 [images/00013.jpg] THOTH, THE IBIS-HEADED.It is doubtful that the deity called Thoth by the Egyptians was originallyHermes, but the two personalities were blended together and it is now impossibleto separate them. Thoth was called “The Lord of the Divine Books” and “Scribe ofthe Company of the Gods.” He is generally pictured with the body of a man andthe head of an ibis. The exact symbolic meaning of this latter bird has neverbeen discovered. A careful analysis of the peculiar shape of the ibis—especiallyits head and beak—should prove illuminating."},{"pageContent":"POIMANDRES, THE VISION OF HERMES The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus is one of the earliest ofthe Hermetic writings now extant. While probably not in its original form,having been remodeled during the first centuries of the Christian Era andincorrectly translated since, this work undoubtedly contains many of theoriginal concepts of the Hermetic cultus. The Divine Pymander consists ofseventeen fragmentary writings gathered together and put forth as one work. Thesecond book of The Divine Pymander, called Poimandres, or The Vision, isbelieved to describe the method by which the divine wisdom was first revealed toHermes. It was after Hermes had received this revelation that he began hisministry, teaching to all who would listen the secrets of the invisible universeas they had been unfolded to him.The Vision is the most famous of all the Hermetic fragments, and contains anexposition of Hermetic cosmogony and the secret sciences of the Egyptiansregarding the culture and unfoldment of the human soul. For some time it waserroneously called “The Genesis of Enoch,” but that mistake has now beenrectified. At hand while preparing the following interpretation of the symbolicphilosophy concealed within The Vision of Hermes the present author has hadthese reference works: The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus(London, 1650), translated out of the Arabic and Greek by Dr. Everard; Hermetica(Oxford, 1924), edited by Walter Scott; Hermes, The Mysteries of Egypt(Philadelphia, 1925), by Edouard Schure; and the Thrice-Greatest Hermes (London,1906), by G.R.S. Mead. To the material contained in the above volumes he hasadded commentaries based upon the esoteric philosophy of the ancient Egyptians,together with amplifications derived partly from other Hermetic fragments andpartly from the secret arcanum of the Hermetic sciences. For the sake ofclarity, the narrative form has been chosen in preference to the originaldialogic style, and obsolete words have given place to those in current use.Hermes, while wandering in a rocky and desolate place, gave himself over tomeditation and prayer. Following the secret instructions of the Temple, hegradually freed his higher consciousness from the bondage of his bodily senses;and, thus released, his divine nature revealed to him the mysteries of thetranscendental spheres. He beheld a figure, terrible and awe-inspiring. It wasthe Great Dragon, with wings stretching across the sky and light streaming inall directions from its body. (The Mysteries taught that the Universal Life waspersonified as a dragon.) The Great Dragon called Hermes by name, and asked himwhy he thus meditated upon the World Mystery. Terrified by the spectacle, Hermesprostrated himself before the Dragon, beseeching it to reveal its identity. Thegreat creature answered that it was Poimandres, the Mind of the Universe, theCreative Intelligence, and the Absolute Emperor of all. (Schure identifiesPoimandres as the god Osiris.) Hermes then besought Poimandres to disclose thenature of the universe and the constitution of the gods. The Dragon acquiesced,bidding Trismegistus hold its image in his mind.Immediately the form of Poimandres changed. Where it had stood there was aglorious and pulsating Radiance. This Light was the spiritual nature of theGreat Dragon itself. Hermes was “raised” into the midst of this divineEffulgence and the universe of material things faded from his consciousness.Presently a great darkness descended and, expanding, swallowed up the Light.Everything was troubled. About Hermes swirled a mysterious watery substancewhich gave forth a smokelike vapor. The air was filled with inarticulatemoanings and sigh- ings which seemed to come from the Light swallowed up in thedarkness. His mind told Hermes that the Light was the form of the spiritualuniverse and that the swirling darkness which had engulfed it representedmaterial substance.Then out of the imprisoned Light a mysterious and Holy Word came forth and tookits stand upon the smoking waters. This Word—the Voice of the Light—rose out ofthe darkness as a great pillar, and the fire and the air followed after it, butthe earth and the water remained unmoved below. Thus the waters of Light weredivided from the waters of darkness, and from the waters of Light were formedthe worlds above and from the waters of darkness were formed the worlds below.The earth and the water next mingled, becoming inseparable, and the SpiritualWord which is called Reason moved upon their surface, causing endless turmoil.Then again was heard the voice of Poimandres, but His form was not revealed: “IThy God am the Light and the Mind which were before substance was divided fromspirit and darkness from Light. And the Word which appeared as a pillar of flameout of the darkness is the Son of God, born of the mystery of the Mind. The nameof that Word is Reason. Reason is the offspring of Thought and Reason shalldivide the Light from the darkness and establish Truth in the midst of thewaters. Understand, O Hermes, and meditate deeply upon the mystery. That whichin you sees and hears is not of the earth, but is the Word of God incarnate. Soit is said that Divine Light dwells in the midst of mortal darkness, andignorance cannot divide them. The union of the Word and the Mind produces thatmystery which is called Life. As the darkness without you is divided againstitself, so the darkness within you is likewise divided. The Light and the firewhich rise are the divine man, ascending in the path of the Word, and that whichfails to ascend is the mortal man, which may not partake of immortality. Learndeeply of the Mind and its mystery, for therein lies the secret of immortality.”The Dragon again revealed its form to Hermes, and for a long time the two lookedsteadfastly one upon the other, eye to eye, so that Hermes trembled before thegaze of Poimandres. At the Word of the Dragon the heavens opened and theinnumerable Light Powers were revealed, soaring through Cosmos on pinions ofstreaming fire. Hermes beheld the spirits of the stars, the celestialscontrolling the universe, and all those Powers which shine with the radiance ofthe One Fire—the glory of the Sovereign Mind. Hermes realized that the sightwhich he beheld was revealed to him only because Poimandres had spoken a Word.The Word was Reason, and by the Reason of the Word invisible things were mademanifest. Divine Mind—the Dragon—continued its discourse:“Before the visible universe was formed its mold was cast. This mold was calledthe Archetype, and this Archetype was in the Supreme Mind long before theprocess of creation began. Beholding the Archetypes, the Supreme Mind becameenamored with Its own thought; so, taking the Word as a mighty hammer, It gougedout caverns in primordial space and cast the form of the spheres in theArchetypal mold, at the same time sowing in the newly fashioned bodies the seedsof living things. The darkness below, receiving the hammer of the Word, wasfashioned into an orderly universe. The elements separated into strata and eachbrought forth living creatures. The Supreme Being—the Mind—male and female,brought forth the Word; and the Word, suspended between Light and darkness, wasdelivered of another Mind called the Workman, the Master-Builder, or the Makerof Things.“In this manner it was accomplished, O Hermes: The Word moving like a breaththrough space called forth the Fire by the friction of its motion. Therefore,the Fire is called the Son of Striving. The Workman passed as a whirlwindthrough the universe, causing the substances to vibrate and glow with itsfriction. The Son of Striving thus formed Seven Governors, the Spirits of thePlanets, whose orbits bounded the world; and the Seven Governors controlled theworld by the mysterious power called Destiny given them by the Fiery Workman.When the Second Mind (The Workman) had organized Chaos, the Word of God rosestraightway out of its prison of substance, leaving the elements without Reason,and joined Itself to the nature of the Fiery Workman. Then the Second Mind,together with the risen Word, established Itself in the midst of the universeand whirled the wheels of the Celestial Powers. This shall continue from aninfinite beginning to an infinite end, for the beginning and the ending are inthe same place and state.“Then the downward-turned and unreasoning elements brought forth creatureswithout Reason. Substance could not bestow Reason, for Reason had ascended outof it. The air produced flying things and the waters such as swim. The earthconceived strange four-footed and creeping beasts, dragons, composite demons,and grotesque monsters. Then the Father—the Supreme Mind—being Light and Life,fashioned a glorious Universal Man in Its own image, not an earthy man but aheavenly Man dwelling in the Light of God. The Supreme Mind loved the Man It hadfashioned and delivered to Him the control of the creations and workmanships.“The Man, desiring to labor, took up His abode in the sphere of generation andobserved the works of His brother—the Second Mind—which sat upon the Ring of theFire. And having beheld the achievements of the Fiery Workman, He willed also tomake things, and His Father gave permission. The Seven Governors, of whosepowers He partook, rejoiced and each gave the Man a share of Its own nature.“The Man longed to pierce the circumference of the circles and understand themystery of Him who sat upon the Eternal Fire. Having already all power, Hestooped down and peeped through the seven Harmonies and, breaking through thestrength of the circles, made Himself manifest to Nature stretched out below.The Man, looking into the depths, smiled, for He beheld a shadow upon the earthand a likeness mirrored in the waters, which shadow and likeness were areflection of Himself. The Man fell in love with His own shadow and desired todescend into it. Coincident with the desire, the Intelligent Thing united Itselfwith the unreasoning image or shape.“Nature, beholding the descent, wrapped herself about the Man whom she loved,and the two were mingled. For this reason, earthy man is composite. Within himis the Sky Man, immortal and beautiful; without is Nature, mortal anddestructible. Thus, suffering is the result of the Immortal Man’s falling inlove with His shadow and giving up Reality to dwell in the darkness of illusion;for, being immortal, man has the power of the Seven Governors—also the Life, theLight, and the Word—but being mortal, he is controlled by the Rings of theGovernors—Fate or Destiny.“Of the Immortal Man it should be said that He is hermaphrodite, or male andfemale, and eternally watchful. He neither slumbers nor sleeps, and is governedby a Father also both male and female, and ever watchful. Such is the mysterykept hidden to this day, for Nature, being mingled in marriage with the Sky Man,brought forth a wonder most wonderful—seven men, all bisexual, male and female,and upright of stature, each one exemplifying the natures of the SevenGovernors. These, O Hermes, are the seven races, species, and wheels.“After this manner were the seven men generated. Earth was the female elementand water the male element, and from the fire and the aether they received theirspirits, and Nature produced bodies after the species and shapes of men. And manreceived the Life and Light of the Great Dragon, and of the Life was made hisSoul and of the Light his Mind. And so, all these composite creatures containingimmortality, but partaking of mortality, continued in this state for theduration of a period. They reproduced themselves out of themselves, for each wasmale and female. But at the end of the period the knot of Destiny was untied bythe will of God and the bond of all things was loosened.“Then all living creatures, including man, which had been hermaphroditi- cal,were separated, the males being set apart by themselves and the femaleslikewise, according to the dictates of Reason.“Then God spoke to the Holy Word within the soul of all things, saying:‘Increase in increasing and multiply in multitudes, all you, my creatures andworkmanships. Let him that is endued with Mind know himself to be immortal andthat the cause of death is the love of the body; and let him learn all thingsthat are, for he who has recognized himself enters into the state of Good.’“And when God had said this, Providence, with the aid of the Seven Governors andHarmony, brought the sexes together, making the mixtures and establishing thegenerations, and all things were multiplied according to their kind. He whothrough the error of attachment loves his body, abides wandering in darkness,sensible and suffering the things of death, but he who realizes that the body isbut the tomb of his soul, rises to immortality.”Then Hermes desired to know why men should be deprived of immortality for thesin of ignorance alone. The Great Dragon answered: “To the ignorant the body issupreme and they are incapable of realizing the immortality that is within them.Knowing only the body which is subject to death, they believe in death becausethey worship that substance which is the cause and reality of death.”Then Hermes asked how the righteous and wise pass to God, to which Poimandresreplied: “That which the Word of God said, say I: ‘Because the Father of allthings consists of Life and Light, whereof man is made.’ If, therefore, a manshall learn and understand the nature of Life and Light, then he shall pass intothe eternity of Life and Light.”Hermes next inquired about the road by which the wise attained to Life eternal,and Poimandres continued: “Let the man endued with a Mind mark, consider, andlearn of himself, and with the power of his Mind divide himself from hisnot-self and become a servant of Reality.”Hermes asked if all men did not have Minds, and the Great Dragon replied: “Takeheed what you say, for I am the Mind—the Eternal Teacher. I am the Father of theWord—the Redeemer of all men—and in the nature of the wise the Word takes flesh.By means of the Word, the world is saved. I, Thought (Thoth)—the Father of theWord, the Mind—come only unto men that are holy and good, pure and merciful, andthat live piously and religiously, and my presence is an inspiration and a helpto them, for when I come they immediately know all things and adore theUniversal Father. Before such wise and philosophic ones die, they learn torenounce their senses, knowing that these are the enemies of their immortalsouls.“I will not permit the evil senses to control the bodies of those who love me,nor will I allow evil emotions and evil thoughts to enter them. I become as aporter or doorkeeper, and shut out evil, protecting the wise from their ownlower nature. But to the wicked, the envious and the covetous, I come not, forsuch cannot understand the mysteries of Mind; therefore, I am unwelcome. I leavethem to the avenging demon that they are making in their own souls, for evileach day increases itself and torments man more sharply, and each evil deed addsto the evil deeds that are gone before until finally evil destroys itself. Thepunishment of desire is the agony of unfulfillment.”Hermes bowed his head in thankfulness to the Great Dragon who had taught him somuch, and begged to hear more concerning the ultimate of the human soul. SoPoimandres resumed: “At death the material body of man is returned to theelements from which it came, and the invisible divine man ascends to the sourcefrom whence he came, namely the Eighth Sphere. The evil passes to the dwellingplace of the demon, and the senses, feelings, desires, and body passions returnto their source, namely the Seven Governors, whose natures in the lower mandestroy but in the invisible spiritual man give life.“After the lower nature has returned to the brutishness, the higher strugglesagain to regain its spiritual estate. It ascends the seven Rings upon which sitthe Seven Governors and returns to each their lower powers in this manner: Uponthe first ring sits the Moon, and to it is returned the ability to increase anddiminish. Upon the second ring sits Mercury, and to it are returnedmachinations, deceit, and craftiness. Upon the third ring sits Venus, and to itare returned the lusts and passions. Upon the fourth ring sits the Sun, and tothis Lord are returned ambitions. Upon the fifth ring sits Mars, and to it arereturned rashness and profane boldness. Upon the sixth ring sits Jupiter, and toit are returned the sense of accumulation and riches. And upon the seventh ringsits Saturn, at the Gate of Chaos, and to it are returned falsehood and evilplotting.“Then, being naked of all the accumulations of the seven Rings, the soul comesto the Eighth Sphere, namely, the ring of the fixed stars. Here, freed of allillusion, it dwells in the Light and sings praises to the Father in a voicewhich only the pure of spirit may understand. Behold, O Hermes, there is a greatmystery in the Eighth Sphere, for the Milky Way is the seed-ground of souls, andfrom it they drop into the Rings, and to the Milky Way they return again fromthe wheels of Saturn. But some cannot climb the seven-runged ladder of theRings. So they wander in darkness below and are swept into eternity with theillusion of sense and earthiness.“The path to immortality is hard, and only a few find it. The rest await theGreat Day when the wheels of the universe shall be stopped and the immortalsparks shall escape from the sheaths of substance. Woe unto those who wait, forthey must return again, unconscious and unknowing, to the seed-ground of stars,and await a new beginning. Those who are saved by the light of the mystery whichI have revealed unto you, O Hermes, and which I now bid you to establish amongmen, shall return again to the Father who dwelleth in the White Light, and shalldeliver themselves up to the Light and shall be absorbed into the Light, and inthe Light they shall become Powers in God. This is the Way of Good and isrevealed only to them that have wisdom.“Blessed art thou, O Son of Light, to whom of all men, I, Poimandres, the Lightof the World, have revealed myself. I order you to go forth, to become as aguide to those who wander in darkness, that all men within whom dwells thespirit of My Mind (The Universal Mind) may be saved by My Mind in you, whichshall call forth My Mind in them. Establish My Mysteries and they shall not failfrom the earth, for I am the Mind of the Mysteries and until Mind fails (whichis never) my Mysteries cannot fail.” With these parting words, Poimandres,radiant with celestial light, vanished, mingling with the powers of the heavens.Raising his eyes unto the heavens, Hermes blessed the Father of All Things andconsecrated his life to the service of the Great Light.Thus preached Hermes: “O people of the earth, men born and made of the elements,but with the spirit of the Divine Man within you, rise from your sleep ofignorance! Be sober and thoughtful. Realize that your home is not in the earthbut in the Light. Why have you delivered yourselves over unto death, havingpower to partake of immortality? Repent, and change your minds. Depart from thedark light and forsake corruption forever. Prepare yourselves to climb throughthe Seven Rings and to blend your souls with the eternal Light.”Some who heard mocked and scoffed and went their way, delivering themselves tothe Second Death from which there is no salvation. But others, castingthemselves before the feet of Hermes, besought him to teach them the Way ofLife. He lifted them gently, receiving no approbation for himself, and staff inhand, went forth teaching and guiding mankind, and showing them how they mightbe saved. In the worlds of men, Hermes sowed the seeds of wisdom and nourishedthe seeds with the Immortal Waters. And at last came the evening of his life,and as the brightness of the light of earth was beginning to go down, Hermescommanded his disciples to preserve his doctrines inviolate throughout all ages.The Vision of Poimandres he committed to writing that all men desiringimmortality might therein find the way.In concluding his exposition of the Vision, Hermes wrote: “The sleep of the bodyis the sober watchfulness of the Mind and the shutting of my eyes reveals thetrue Light. My silence is filled with budding life and hope, and is full ofgood. My words are the blossoms of fruit of the tree of my soul. For this is thefaithful account of what I received from my true Mind, that is Poimandres, theGreat Dragon, the Lord of the Word, through whom I became inspired by God withthe Truth. Since that day my Mind has been ever with me and in my own soul ithath given birth to the Word: the Word is Reason, and Reason hath redeemed me.For which cause, with all my soul and all my strength, I give praise andblessing unto God the Father, the Life and the Light, and the Eternal Good.> “Holy is God, the Father of all things, the One who is before the First> Beginning.> “Holy is God, whose will is performed and accomplished by His own Powers which> He hath given birth to out of Himself.> “Holy is God, who has determined that He shall be known, and who is known by> His own to whom He reveals Himself.> “Holy art Thou, who by Thy Word (Reason) hast established all things.> “Holy art Thou, of whom all Nature is the image.> “Holy art Thou, whom the inferior nature has not formed.> “Holy art Thou, who art stronger than all powers.> “Holy art Thou, who art greater than all excellency.> “Holy art Thou, who art better than all praise.> “Accept these reasonable sacrifices from a pure soul and a heart stretched out> unto Thee.> “O Thou Unspeakable, Unutterable, to be praised with silence!> “I beseech Thee to look mercifully upon me, that I may not err from the> knowledge of Thee and that I may enlighten those that are in ignorance, my> brothers and Thy sons.> “Therefore I believe Thee and bear witness unto Thee, and depart in peace and> in trustfuless into Thy Light and Life.> “Blessed art Thou, O Father! The man Thou hast fashioned would be sanctified> with Thee as Thou hast given him power to sanctify others with Thy Word and> Thy Truth.” The Vision of Hermes, like nearly all of the Hermetic writings, is anallegorical exposition of great philosophic and mystic truths, and its hiddenmeaning may be comprehended only by those who have been “raised” into thepresence of the True Mind."},{"pageContent":"VII The Initiation of the Pyramid Supreme among the wonders of antiquity, unrivaled by the achievements of laterarchitects and builders, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh bears mute witness to anunknown civilization which, having completed its predestined span, passed intooblivion. Eloquent in its silence, inspiring in its majesty, divine in itssimplicity, the Great Pyramid is indeed a sermon in stone. Its magnitudeoverwhelms the puny sensibilities of man. Among the shifting sands of time itstands as a fitting emblem of eternity itself. Who were the illuminedmathematicians who planned its parts and dimensions, the master craftsmen whosupervised its construction, the skilled artisans who trued its blocks of stone?The earliest and best-known account of the building of the Great Pyramid is thatgiven by that highly revered but somewhat imaginative historian, Herodotus. “Thepyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is called, or, according toothers, altar-wise. After laying the stones for the base, they raised theremaining stones to their places by means of machines formed to short woodenplanks. The first machine raised them from the ground to the top of the firststep. On this there was another machine, which received the stone upon itsarrival, and conveyed it to the second step, whence a third machine advanced itstill higher. Either they had as many machines as there were steps in thepyramid, or possibly they had but a single machine, which, being easily moved,was transferred from tier to tier as the stone rose. Both accounts are given,and therefore I mention both. The upper portion of the pyramid was finishedfirst, then the middle, and finally the part which was lowest and nearest theground. There is an inscription in Egyptian characters on the pyramid whichrecords the quantity of radishes, onions, and garlick consumed by the labourerswho constructed it; and I perfectly well remember that the interpreter who readthe writing to me said that the money expended in this way was 1600 talents ofsilver. If this then is a true record, what a vast sum must have been spent onthe iron tools used in the work, and on the feeding and clothing of thelabourers, considering the length of time the work lasted, which has alreadybeen stated [ten years], and the additional time—no small space, I imagine—whichmust have been occupied by the quarrying of the stones, their conveyance, andthe formation of the underground apartments.”013 [images/00014.jpg] CEDIPUS AND THE SPHINX.The Egyptian Sphinx is closely related to the Greek legend of Œdipus, who firstsolved the famous riddle propounded by the mysterious creature with the body ofa winged lion and the head of a woman which frequented the highway leading toThebes. To each who passed her lair the sphinx addressed the question, “Whataminal is it that in the morning goes on four feet, at noon on two feet, and inthe evening on three feet?” Those who failed to answer her riddle she destroyed.Œdipus declared the answer to be man himself, who in childhood crawled upon hishands and knees, in manhood stood erect, and in old age shuffled alongsupporting himself by a staff. Discovering one who knew the answer to herriddle, the sphinx cast herself from the cliff which bordered the road andperished.There is still another answer to the riddle of the sphinx, an answer bestrevealed by a consideration of the Pythagorean values of numbers. The 4, the 2,and the 3 produce the sum of 9, which is that natural number of man and also ofthe lower worlds. The 4 represents the ignorant man, the 2 the intellectual man,and the 3 the spiritual man. Infant humanity walks on four legs, evolvinghumanity on two legs, and to the power of his own mind the redeemed andilluminated magus adds the staff of wisdom. The sphinx is therefore the mysteryof Nature, the embodiment of the secret doctrine, and all who cannot solve herriddle perish. To pass the sphinx is to attain personal immortality.While his account is extremely colorful, it is apparent that the Father ofHistory, for reasons which he doubtless considered sufficient, concocted afraudulent story to conceal the true origin and the purpose of the GreatPyramid. This is but one of several instances in his writings which would leadthe thoughtful reader to suspect that Herodotus himself was an initiate of theSacred Schools and consequently obligated to preserve inviolate the secrets ofthe ancient orders. The theory advanced by Herodotus and now generally acceptedthat the Pyramid was the tomb of the Pharaoh Cheops cannot be substantiated. Infact, Manetho, Eratosthenes, and Diodorus Siculus all differ from Herodotus—aswell as from each other—regarding the name of the builder of this supremeedifice. The sepulchral vault, which, according to the Lepsius Law of pyramidconstruction, should have been finished at the same time as the monument orsooner, was never completed. There is no proof that the building was erected bythe Egyptians, for the elaborate carvings with which the burial chambers ofEgyptian royalty are almost invariably ornamented are entirely lacking and itembodies none of the elements of their architecture or decoration, such asinscriptions, images, cartouches, paintings, and other distinctive featuresassociated with dynastic mortuary art. The only hieroglyphics to be found withinthe Pyramid are a few builders’ marks sealed up in the chambers of construction,first opened by Howard Vyse. These apparently were painted upon the stonesbefore they were set in position, for in a number of instances the marks wereeither inverted or disfigured by the operation of fitting the blocks together.While Egyptologists have attempted to identify the crude dabs of paint ascartouches of Cheops, it is almost inconceivable that this ambitious ruler wouldhave permitted his royal name to suffer such indignities. As the most eminentauthorities on the subject are still uncertain as to the true meaning of thesecrude markings, whatever proof they might be that the building was erectedduring the fourth dynasty is certainly offset by the sea shells at the base ofthe Pyramid which Mr. Gab advances as evidence that it was erected before theDeluge—a theory substantiated by the much-abused Arabian traditions. One Arabianhistorian declared that the Pyramid was built by the Egyptian sages as a refugeagainst the Flood, while another proclaimed it to have been the treasure houseof the powerful antediluvian king Sheddad Ben Ad. A panel of hieroglyphs overthe entrance, which the casual observer might consider to afford a solution ofthe mystery, unfortunately dates back no further than A.D. 1843, having been cutat that time by Dr. Lepsius as a tribute to the King of Prussia.Caliph al Mamoun, an illustrious descendant of the Prophet, inspired by storiesof the immense treasures sealed within its depths, journeyed from Bagdad toCairo, A.D. 820, with a great force of workmen to open the mighty Pyramid. WhenCaliph al Mamoun first reached the foot of the “Rock of Ages” and gazed up atits smooth glistening surface, a tumult of emotions undoubtedly racked his soul.The casing stones must have been in place at the time of his visit, for theCaliph could find no indication of an entrance—four perfectly smooth surfacesconfronted him. Following vague rumors, he set his followers to work on thenorth side of the Pyramid, with instructions to keep on cutting and chiselinguntil they discovered something. To the Moslems with their crude instruments andvinegar it was a herculean effort to tunnel a full hundred feet through thelimestone. Many times they were on the point of rebellion, but the word of theCaliph was law and the hope of a vast fortune buoyed them up.At last on the eve of total discouragement fate came to their rescue. A greatstone was heard to fall somewhere in the wall near the toiling and disgruntledArabs. Pushing on toward the sound with renewed enthusiasm, they finally brokeinto the descending passage which leads into the subterranean chamber. They thenchiseled their way around the great stone portcullis which had fallen into aposition barring their progress, and attacked and removed one after another thegranite plugs which for a while continued to slide down the passage leading fromthe Queen’s Chamber above.Finally no more blocks descended and the way was clear for the followers of theProphet. But where were the treasures? From room to room the frantic workmenrushed, looking in vain for loot. The discontent of the Moslems reached such aheight that Caliph al Mamoun—who had inherited much of the wisdom of hisillustrious father, the Caliph al Raschid—sent to Bagdad for funds, which hecaused to be secretly buried near the entrance of the Pyramid. He then orderedhis men to dig at that spot and great was their rejoicing when the treasure wasdiscovered, the workmen being deeply impressed by the wisdom of the antediluvianmonarch who had carefully estimated their wages and thoughtfully caused theexact amount to be buried for their benefit!The Caliph then returned to the city of his fathers and the Great Pyramid wasleft to the mercy of succeeding generations. In the ninth century the sun’s raysstriking the highly polished surfaces of the original casing stones caused eachside of the Pyramid to appear as a dazzling triangle of light. Since that time,all but two of these casing stones have disappeared. Investigation has resultedin their discovery, recut and resurfaced, in the walls of Mohammedan mosques andpalaces in various parts of Cairo and its environs."},{"pageContent":"PYRAMID PROBLEMS C. Piazzi Smyth asks: “Was the Great Pyramid, then, erected before the inventionof hieroglyphics, and previous to the birth of the Egyptian religion?” Time mayyet prove that the upper chambers of the Pyramid were a sealed mystery beforethe establishment of the Egyptian empire. In the subterranean chamber, however,are markings which indicate that the Romans gained admission there. In the lightof the secret philosophy of the Egyptian initiates, W. W. Harmon, by a series ofextremely complicated yet exact mathematical calculations, determines that thefirst ceremonial of the Pyramid was performed 68,890 years ago on the occasionwhen the star Vega for the first time sent its ray down the descending passageinto the pit. The actual building of the Pyramid was accomplished in the periodof from ten to fifteen years immediately preceding this date.While such figures doubtless will evoke the ridicule of modern Egyptologists,they are based upon an exhaustive study of the principles of sidereal mechanicsas incorporated into the structure of the Pyramid by its initiated builders. Ifthe casing stones were in position at the beginning of the ninth century, theso-called erosion marks upon the outside were not due to water. The theory alsothat the salt upon the interior stones of the Pyramid is evidence that thebuilding was once submerged is weakened by the scientific fact that this kind ofstone is subject to exudations of salt. While the building may have beensubmerged, at least in part, during the many thousands of years since itserection, the evidence adduced to prove this point is not conclusive.The Great Pyramid was built of limestone and granite throughout, the two kindsof rock being combined in a peculiar and significant manner. The stones weretrued with the utmost precision, and the cement used was of such remarkablequality that it is now practically as hard as the stone itself. The limestoneblocks were sawed with bronze saws, the teeth of which were diamonds or otherjewels. The chips from the stones were piled against the north side of theplateau on which the structure stands, where they form an additional buttress toaid in supporting the weight of the structure. The entire Pyramid is an exampleof perfect orientation and actually squares the circle. This last isaccomplished by dropping a vertical line from the apex of the Pyramid to itsbase line. If this vertical line be considered as the radius of an imaginarycircle, the length of the circumference of such a circle will be found to equalthe sum of the base lines of the four sides of the Pyramid.If the passage leading to the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber was sealedup thousands of years before the Christian Era, those later admitted into thePyramid Mysteries must have received their initiations in subterranean galleriesnow unknown. Without such galleries there could have been no possible means ofingress or egress, since the single surface entrance was completely closed withcasing stones. If not blocked by the mass of the Sphinx or concealed in somepart of that image, the secret entrance may be either in one of the adjacenttemples or upon the sides of the limestone plateau.Attention is called to the granite plugs filling the ascending passageway to theQueen’s Chamber which Caliph al Mamoun was forced practically to pulverizebefore he could clear a way into the upper chambers. C. Piazzi Smyth notes thatthe position of the stones demonstrate that they were set in place fromabove—which made it necessary for a considerable number of workmen to departfrom the upper chambers. How did they do it? Smyth believes they descendedthrough the wall (see diagram), dropping the ramp stone into place behind them.He further contends that robbers probably used the well as a means of gettinginto the upper chambers. The ramp stone having been set in a bed of plaster, therobbers were forced to break through it, leaving a jagged opening. Mr. Dupré, anarchitect who has spent years investigating the pyramids, differs from Smyth,however, in that he believes the well itself to be a robbers’ hole, being thefirst successful attempt made to enter the upper chambers from the subterraneanchamber, then the only open section of the Pyramid.Mr. Dupré bases his conclusion upon the fact that the well is merely a roughhole and the grotto an irregular chamber, without any evidence of thearchitectural precision with which the remainder of the structure was erected.The diameter of the well also precludes the possibility of its having been dugdownward; it must have been gouged out from below, and the grotto was necessaryto supply air to the thieves. It is inconceivable that the Pyramid builderswould break one of their own ramp stones and leave its broken surface and agaping hole in the side wall of their otherwise perfect gallery. If the well isa robbers’ hole, it may explain why the Pyramid was empty when Caliph al Mamounentered it and what happened to the missing coffer lid. A careful examination ofthe so-called unfinished subterranean chamber, which must have been the base ofoperations for the robbers, might disclose traces of their presence or showwhere they piled the rubble which must have accumulated as a result of theiroperations. While it is not entirely clear by what entrance the robbers reachedthe subterranean chamber, it is improbable that they used the descendingpassageway.There is a remarkable niche in the north wall of the Queen’s Chamber which theMohammedan guides glibly pronounce to be a shrine. The general shape of thisniche, however, with its walls converging by a series of overlaps like those ofthe Grand Gallery, would indicate that originally it had been intended as apassageway. Efforts made to explore this niche have been nonproductive, but Mr.Dupré believes an entrance to exist here through which—if the well did not existat the time—the workmen made their exit through the Pyramid after dropping thestone plugs into the ascending gallery.Biblical scholars have contributed a number of most extraordinary conceptionsregarding the Great Pyramid. This ancient edifice has been identified by them asJoseph’s granary (despite its hopelessly inadequate capacity); as the tombprepared for the unfortunate Pharaoh of the Exodus who could not be buried therebecause his body was never recovered from the Red Sea; and finally as aperpetual confirmation of the infallibility of the numerous prophecies containedin the Authorized Version!"},{"pageContent":"THE SPHINX Although the Great Pyramid, as Ignatius Donnelly has demonstrated, is patternedafter an antediluvian type of architecture, examples of which are to be found innearly every part of the world, the Sphinx (Hu) is typically Egyptian. The stelebetween its paws states the Sphinx is an image of the Sun God, Harmackis, whichwas evidently made in the similitude of the Pharaoh during whose reign it waschiseled. The statue was restored and completely excavated by Tahutmes IV as theresult of a vision in which the god had appeared and declared himself oppressedby the weight of the sand about his body. The broken beard of the Sphinx wasdiscovered during excavations between the front paws. The steps leading up tothe Sphinx and also the temple and altar between the paws are much lateradditions, probably Roman, for it is known that the Romans reconstructed manyEgyptian antiquities. The shallow depression in the crown of the head, oncethought to be the terminus of a closed-up passageway leading from the Sphinx tothe Great Pyramid, was merely intended to help support a headdress now missing.Metal rods have been driven into the Sphinx in a vain effort to discoverchambers or passages within its body. The major part of the Sphinx is a singlestone, but the front paws have been built up of smaller stones. The Sphinx isabout 200 feet long, 70 feet high, and 38 feet wide across the shoulders. Themain stone from which it was carved is believed by some to have been transportedfrom distant quarries by methods unknown, while others assert it to be nativerock, possibly an outcropping somewhat resembling the form into which it waslater carved. The theory once advanced that both the Pyramid and the Sphinx werebuilt from artificial stones made on the spot has been abandoned. A carefulanalysis of the limestone shows it to be composed of small sea creatures calledmummulites.The popular supposition that the Sphinx was the true portal of the GreatPyramid, while it survives with surprising tenacity, has never beensubstantiated. P. Christian presents this theory as follows, basing it in partupon the authority of Iamblichus:“The Sphinx of Gizeh, says the author of the Traité des Mystères, served as theentrance to the sacred subterranean chambers in which the trials of the initiatewere undergone. This entrance, obstructed in our day by sands and rubbish, maystill be traced between the forelegs of the crouched colossus. It was formerlyclosed by a bronze gate whose secret spring could be operated only by the Magi.It was guarded by public respect and a sort of religious fear maintained itsinviolability better than armed protection would have done. In the belly of theSphinx were cut out galleries leading to the subterranean part of the GreatPyramid. These galleries were so artfully crisscrossed along their course to thePyramid that in setting forth into the passage without a guide through thisnetwork, one ceaselessly and inevitably returned to the starting point.” (SeeHistoire de la Magie.)Unfortunately, the bronze door referred to cannot be found, nor is there anyevidence that it ever existed. The passing centuries have wrought many changesin the colossus, however, and the original opening may have been closed.Nearly all students of the subject believe that subterranean chambers existbeneath the Great Pyramid. Robert Ballard writes: “The priests of the Pyramidsof Lake Moeris had their vast subterranean residences. It appears to me morethan probable that those of Gizeh were similarly provided. And I may go further:—Out of these very caverns may have been excavated the limestone of which thePyramids were built. * * * In the bowels of the limestone ridge on which thePyramids are built will yet be found, I feel convinced, ample information as totheir uses. A good diamond drill with two or three hundred feet of rods is whatis wanted to test this, and the solidarity of the Pyramids at the same time.”(See The Solution of the Pyramid Problem.)Mr. Ballard’s theory of extensive underground apartments and quarries brings upan important problem in architectonics. The Pyramid builders were too farsightedto endanger the permanence of the Great Pyramid by placing over five milliontons of limestone and granite on any but a solid foundation. It is thereforereasonably certain that such chambers or passageways as may exist beneath thebuilding are relatively insignificant, like those within the body of thestructure, which occupy less than one sixteen-hundredth of the cubic contents ofthe Pyramid.The Sphinx was undoubtedly erected for symbolical purposes at the instigation ofthe priestcraft. The theories that the uræus upon its forehead was originallythe finger of an immense sundial and that both the Pyramid and the Sphinx wereused to measure time, the seasons, and the precession of the equinoxes areingenious but not wholly convincing. If this great creature was erected toobliterate the ancient passageway leading into the subterranean temple of thePyramid, its symbolism would be most appropriate. In comparison with theoverwhelming size and dignity of the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx is almostinsignificant. Its battered face, upon which may still be seen vestiges of thered paint with which the figure was originally covered, is disfigured beyondrecognition. Its nose was broken off by a fanatical Mohammedan, lest thefollow-ers of the Prophet be led into idolatry. The very nature of itsconstruction and the present repairs necessary to prevent the head from fallingoff indicate that it could not have survived the great periods of time whichhave elapsed since the erection of the Pyramid.014 [images/00015.jpg] A VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GREAT PYRAMID.The Great Pyramid stands upon a limestone plateau at the base of which,according to ancient history, the Nile once flowed, thus supplying a method oftransportation for the huge blocks used in its construction. Presuming that thecapstone was originally in place, the Pyramid is, according to John Taylor, inround figures 486 feet high; the base of each side is 764 feet long, and theentire structure covers a ground area of more than 13 acres.The Great Pyramid is the only one in the group at Gizeh—in fact, as far asknown, the only one in Egypt—that has chambers within the actual body of thePyramid itself. For this reason it is said to refute the Lepsius Law, whichasserts that each of these structures is a monument raised over a subtenaneanchamber in which a ruler is entombed. The Pyramid contains four chambers, whichin the diagram are lettered K, H, F, and 0.The King’s Chamber (K) is an oblong apartment 39 feet long, 17 feet wide, and 19feet high (disregarding fractional parts of a foot in each case), with a flatroof consisting of nine great stones, the largest in the Pyramid. Above theKing’s Chamber are five low compartments (L), generally termed constructionchambers. In the lowest of these the so-called hieroglyphs of the Pharaoh Cheopsare located. The roof of the fifth construction chamber is peaked. At the end ofthe King’s Chamber opposite the entrance stands the famous sarcophagus, orcoffer (I), and behind it is a shallow opening that was dug in the hope ofdiscovering valuables. Two air vents (M, N) passing through the entire body ofthe Pyramid ventilate the King’s Chamber. In itself this is sufficient toestablish that the building was not intended for a tomb.Between the upper end of the Grand Gallery (G. G.) and the King’s Chamber is asmall antechamber (H), its extreme length 9 feet, its extreme width 5 feet, andits extreme height 12 feet, with its walls grooved for purposes now unknown. Inthe groove nearest the Grand Gallery is a slab of stone in two sections, with apeculiar boss or knob protruding about an inch from the surface of the upperpart facing the Grand Gallery. This stone does not reach to the floor of theantechamber and those entering the King’s Chamber must pass under the slab. Fromthe King’s Chamber the Grand Gallery—157 feet in length, 28 feet in height. 7feet in width at its widest point and decreasing to 3½ feet as the result ofseven converging overlaps of the stones forming the walls—descends to a littleabove the Queen’s Chamber. Here a gallery (E) branches off, passing more than100 feet back towards the center of the Pyramid and opening into the Queen’sChamber (F). The Queen’s Chamber is 19 feet long, 17 feet wide, and 20 feethigh. Its roof is peaked and composed of great slabs of stone. Air passages notshown lead from the Queen’s Chamber, but these were not open originally. In theeast wall of the Queen’s Chamber is a peculiar niche of gradually convergingstone, which, in all likelihood, may prove to be a now lost entrance way.At the point where the Grand Gallery ends and the horizontal passage towards theQueen’s Chamber begins is the entrance to the well and also the opening leadingdown the first ascending passage (D) to the point where this passage meets thedescending passage (A) leading from the outer wall of the Pyramid down to thesubterranean chamber. After descending 59 feet down the well (P), the grotto isreached. Continuing through the floor of the grotto the well leads downward 133feet to the descending entrance passage (A), which it meets a short distancebefore this passage becomes horizontal and leads into the subterranean chamber.The subterranean chamber (0) is about 46 feet long and 27 feet wide, but isextremely low, the ceiling varying in height from a little over 3 feet to about13 feet from the rough and apparently unfinished floor. From the south side ofthe subterranean chamber a low tunnel runs about 50 feet and then meets a blankwall. These constitute the only known openings in the Pyramid, with theexception of a few niches, exploration holes, blind passages, and the ramblingcavernous tunnel (8) hewn out by the Moslems under the leadership of theProphet’s descendant, Caliph al Mamoun.To the Egyptians, the Sphinx was the symbol of strength and intelligence. It wasportrayed as androgynous to signify that they recognized the initiates and godsas partaking of both the positive and negative creative powers. Gerald Masseywrites: “This is the secret of the Sphinx. The orthodox sphinx of Egypt ismasculine in front and feminine behind. So is the image of Sut-Typhon, a type ofhorn and tail, male in front and female behind. The Pharaohs, who wore the tailof the Lioness or Cow behind them, were male in front and female behind. Likethe Gods they included the dual totality of Being in one person, born of theMother, but of both sexes as the Child.” (See The Natural Genesis.)Most investigators have ridiculed the Sphinx and, without even deigning toinvestigate the great colossus, have turned their attention to the mostoverwhelming mystery of the Pyramid."},{"pageContent":"THE PYRAMID MYSTERIES The word pyramid is popularly supposed to be derived from πρ, fire, thussignifying that it is the symbolic representation of the One Divine Flame, thelife of every creature. John Taylor believes the word pyramid to mean a “measureof wheat,” while C. Piazzi Smyth favors the Coptic meaning, “a division intoten.” The initiates of old accepted the pyramid form as the ideal symbol of boththe secret doctrine and chose institutions established for its dissemination.Both pyramids and mounds are antitypes of the Holy Mountain, or High Place ofGod, which was believed to stand in the “midst” of the earth. John P. Lundyrelates the Great Pyramid to the fabled Olympus, further assuming that itssubterranean passages correspond to the tortuous byways of Hades.The square base of the Pyramid is a constant reminder that the House of Wisdomis firmly founded upon Nature and her immutable laws. “The Gnostics,” writesAlbert Pike, “claimed that the whole edifice of their science rested on a squarewhose angles were: Σγη, Silence; Bυθoς, Profundity; Noυς, Intelligence; Aληθεα,Truth.” (See Morals and Dogma.) The sides of the Great Pyramid face the fourcardinal angles, the latter signifying according to Eliphas Levi the extremitiesof heat and cold (south and north) and the extremities of light and darkness(east and west). The base of the Pyramid further represents the four materialelements or substances from the combinations of which the quaternary body of manis formed. From each side of the square there rises a triangle, typifying thethreefold divine being enthroned within every quaternary material nature. Ifeach base line be considered a square from which ascends a threefold spiritualpower, then the sum of the lines of the four faces (12) and the fourhypothetical squares (16) constituting the base is 28, the sacred number of thelower world. If this be added to the three septenaries composing the sun (21),it equals 49, the square of 7 and the number of the universe.The twelve signs of the zodiac, like the Governors of the lower worlds, aresymbolized by the twelve lines of the four triangles—of the faces of thePyramid. In the midst of each face is one of the beasts of Ezekiel, and thestructure as a whole becomes the Cherubim. The three main chambers of thePyramid are related to the heart, the brain, and the generative system—thespiritual centers of the human constitution. The triangular form of the Pyramidalso is similar to the posture assumed by the body during the ancient meditativeexercises. The Mysteries taught that the divine energies from the gods descendedupon the top of the Pyramid, which was likened to an inverted tree with itsbranches below and its roots at the apex. From this inverted tree the divinewisdom is disseminated by streaming down the diverging sides and radiatingthroughout the world.The size of the capstone of the Great Pyramid cannot be accurately determined,for, while most investigators have assumed that it was once in place, no vestigeof it now remains. There is a curious tendency among the builders of greatreligious edifices to leave their creations unfinished, thereby signifying thatGod alone is complete. The capstone—if it existed—was itself a miniaturepyramid, the apex of which again would be capped by a smaller block of similarshape, and so on ad infinitum. The capstone therefore is the epitome of theentire structure. Thus, the Pyramid may be likened to the universe and thecapstone to man. Following the chain of analogy, the mind is the capstone ofman, the spirit the capstone of the mind, and God—the epitome of the whole—thecapstone of the spirit. As a rough and unfinished block, man is taken from thequarry and by the secret culture of the Mysteries gradually transformed into atrued and perfect pyramidal capstone. The temple is complete only when theinitiate himself becomes the living apex through which the divine power isfocused into the diverging structure below.W. Marsham Adams calls the Great Pyramid “the House of the Hidden Places”; suchindeed it was, for it represented the inner sanctuary of pre-Egyptian wisdom. Bythe Egyptians the Great Pyramid was associated with Hermes, the god of wisdomand letters and the Divine Illuminator worshiped through the planet Mercury.Relating Hermes to the Pyramid emphasizes anew the fact that it was in realitythe supreme temple of the Invisible and Supreme Deity. The Great Pyramid was nota lighthouse, an observatory, or a tomb, but the first temple of the Mysteries,the first structure erected as a repository for those secret truths which arethe certain foundation of all arts and sciences. It was the perfect emblem ofthe microcosm and the macrocosm and, according to the secret teachings, the tombof Osiris, the black god of the Nile. Osiris represents a certain manifestationof solar energy, and therefore his house or tomb is emblematic of the universewithin which he is entombed and upon the cross of which he is crucified.Through the mystic passageways and chambers of the Great Pyramid passed theillumined of antiquity. They entered its portals as men; they came forth asgods. It was the place of the “second birth,” the “womb of the Mysteries,” andwisdom dwelt in it as God dwells in the hearts of men. Somewhere in the depthsof its recesses there resided an unknown being who was called “The Initiator,”or “The Illustrious One,” robed in blue and gold and bearing in his hand thesevenfold key of Eternity. This was the lion-faced hierophant, the Holy One, theMaster of Masters, who never left the House of Wisdom and whom no man ever sawsave he who had passed through the gates of preparation and purification. It wasin these chambers that Plato—he of the broad brow—came face to face with thewisdom of the ages personified in the Master of the Hidden House.Who was the Master dwelling in the mighty Pyramid, the many rooms of whichsignified the worlds in space; the Master whom none might behold save those whohad been “born again”? He alone fully knew the secret of the Pyramid, but he hasdeparted the way of the wise and the house is empty. The hymns of praise nolonger echo in muffled tones through the chambers; the neophyte no longer passesthrough the elements and wanders among the seven stars; the candidate no longerreceives the “Word of Life” from the lips of the Eternal One. Nothing nowremains that the eye of man can see but an empty shell—the outer symbol of aninner truth—and men call the House of God a tomb!The technique of the Mysteries was unfolded by the Sage Illuminator, the Masterof the Secret House. The power to know his guardian spirit was revealed to thenew initiate; the method of disentangling his material body from his divinevehicle was explained; and to consummate the magnum opus, there was revealed theDivine Name—the secret and unutterable designation of the Supreme Deity, by thevery knowledge of which man and his God are made consciously one. With thegiving of the Name, the new initiate became himself a pyramid, within thechambers of whose soul numberless other human beings might also receivespiritual enlightenment.In the King’s Chamber was enacted the drama of the “second death.” Here thecandidate, after being crucified upon the cross of the solstices and theequinoxes, was buried in the great coffer. There is a profound mystery to theatmosphere and temperature of the King’s Chamber: it is of a peculiar deathlikecold which cuts to the marrow of the bone. This room was a doorway between thematerial world and the transcendental spheres of Nature. While his body lay inthe coffer, the soul of the neophyte soared as a human-headed hawk through thecelestial realms, there to discover first hand the eternity of Life, Light, andTruth, as well as the illusion of Death, Darkness, and Sin. Thus in one sensethe Great Pyramid may be likened to a gate through which the ancient priestspermitted a few to pass toward the attainment of individual completion. It isalso to be noted incidentally that if the coffer in the King’s Chamber bestruck, the sound emitted has no counterpart in any known musical scale. Thistonal value may have formed part of that combination of circumstances whichrendered the King’s Chamber an ideal setting for the conferment of the highestdegree of the Mysteries.The modern world knows little of these ancient rites. The scientist and thetheologian alike gaze upon the sacred structure, wondering what fundamental urgeinspired the herculean labor. If they would but think for a moment, they wouldrealize that there is only one urge in the soul of man capable of supplying therequired incentive—namely, the desire to know, to understand, and to exchangethe narrowness of human mortality for the greater breadth and scope of divineenlightenment. So men say of the Great Pyramid that it is the most perfectbuilding in the world, the source of weights and measures, the original Noah’sArk, the origin of languages, alphabets, and scales of temperature and humidity.Few realize, however, that it is the gateway to the Eternal.Though the modern world may know a million secrets, the ancient world knewone—and that one was greater than the million; for the million secrets breeddeath, disaster, sorrow, selfishness, lust, and avarice, but the one secretconfers life, light, and truth. The time will come when the secret wisdom shallagain be the dominating religious and philosophical urge of the world. The dayis at hand when the doom of dogma shall be sounded. The great theological Towerof Babel, with its confusion of tongues, was built of bricks of mud and themortar of slime. Out of the cold ashes of lifeless creeds, however, shall risephoenixlike the ancient Mysteries. No other institution has so completelysatisfied the religious aspirations of humanity, for since the destruction ofthe Mysteries there never has been a religious code to which Plato could havesubscribed. The unfolding of man’s spiritual nature is as much an exact scienceas astronomy, medicine or jurisprudence. To accomplish this end religions wereprimarily established; and out of religion have come science, philosophy, andlogic as methods whereby this divine purpose might be realized.The Dying God shall rise again! The secret room in the House of the HiddenPlaces shall be rediscovered. The Pyramid again shall stand as the ideal emblemof solidarity, inspiration, aspiration, resurrection, and regeneration. As thepassing sands of time bury civilization upon civilization beneath their weight,the Pyramid shall remain as the visible covenant between Eternal Wisdom and theworld. The time may yet come when the chants of the illumined shall be heardonce more in its ancient passageways and the Master of the Hidden House shallawait in the Silent Place for the coming of that man who, casting aside thefallacies of dogma and tenet, seeks simply Truth and will be satisfied withneither substitute nor counterfeit."},{"pageContent":"VIII Isis the Virgin of the World It is especially fitting that a study of Hermetic symbolism should begin with adiscussion of the symbols and attributes of the Saitic Isis. This is the Isis ofSais, famous for the inscription concerning her which appeared on the front ofher temple in that city: “I, Isis, am all that has been, that is or shall be; nomortal Man hath ever me unveiled.”Plutarch affirms that many ancient authors believed this goddess to be thedaughter of Hermes; others held the opinion that she was the child ofPrometheus. Both of these demigods were noted for their divine wisdom. It is notimprobable that her kinship to them is merely allegorical. Plutarch translatesthe name Isis to mean wisdom. Godfrey Higgins, in his Anacalypsis, derives thename of Isis from the Hebrew015 [images/00016.jpg], Iso, and the Greek ξωω, tosave. Some authorities, however, for example, Richard Payne Knight (as stated inhis Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology), believe the word to be ofNorthern extraction, possibly Scandinavian or Gothic. In these languages thename is pronounced Isa, meaning ice, or water in its most passive, crystallized,negative state.This Egyptian deity under many names appears as the principle of naturalfecundity among nearly all the religions of the ancient world. She was known asthe goddess with ten thousand appellations and was metamorphosed by Christianityinto the Virgin Mary, for Isis, although she gave birth to all livingthings—chief among them the Sun—still remained a virgin, according to thelegendary accounts.Apuleius in the eleventh book of The Golden Ass ascribes to the goddess thefollowing statement concerning her powers and attributes: “Behold, * *, I, movedby thy prayers, am present with thee; I, who am Nature, the parent of things,the queen of all the elements, the primordial progeny of ages, the supreme ofDivinities, the sovereign of the spirits of the dead, the first of thecelestials, and the uni-form resemblance of Gods and Goddesses. I, who rule bymy nod the luminous summits of the heavens, the salubrious breezes of the sea,and the deplorable silences of the realms beneath and whose one divinity thewhole orb of the earth venerates under a manifold form, by different rites and avariety of appellations. Hence the primogenial Phrygians call me Pessinuntica,the mother of the Gods; the Attic Aborigines, Cecropian Minerva; the floatingCyprians, Paphian Venus; arrow-bearing Cretans, Diana Dictynna; thethree-tongued Sicilians, Stygian Proserpine; and the Eleusinians, the ancientGoddess Ceres. Some also call me Juno, others Bellona, others Hecate, and othersRhamnusia. And those who are illuminated by the incipient rays of that divinitythe Sun, when he rises, viz. the Ethiopians, the Arii, and the Egyptians skilledin ancient learning, worshipping me by ceremonies perfectly appropriate, call meby my true name, Queen Isis.”016 [images/00017.jpg] ISIS, QUEEN OF HEAVEN.Diodorus writes of a famous inscription carved on a column at Nysa, in Arabia,wherein Isis described herself as follows: “I am Isis, Queen of this country. Iwas instructed by Mercury. No one can destroy the laws which I have established.I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of the gods. I am the wife andsister of Osiris the King. I first made known to mortals the use of wheat. I amthe mother of Orus the King. In my honor was the city of Bubaste built. Rejoice,0 Egypt, rejoice, Land that gave me birth!” (See “Morals and Dogma,” by AlbertPike.) Le Plongeon believes that the Egyptian myth of Isis had a historical basis amongthe Mayas of Central America, where this goddess was known as Queen Moo. InPrince Coh the same author finds a correspondence to Osiris, the brother-husbandof Isis. Le Plongeon’s theory is that Mayan civilization was far more ancientthan that of Egypt. After the death of Prince Coh, his widow, Queen Moo, fleeingto escape the wrath of his murderers, sought refuge among the Mayan colonies inEgypt, where she was accepted as their queen and was given the name of Isis.While Le Plongeon may be right, the possible historical queen sinks intoinsignificance when compared with the allegorical, symbolic World Virgin; andthe fact that she appears among so many different races and peoples discreditsthe theory that she was a historical individual.According to Sextus Empyricus, the Trojan war was fought over a statue of themoon goddess. For this lunar Helena, and not for a woman, the Greeks and Trojansstruggled at the gates of Troy.Several authors have attempted to prove that Isis, Osiris, Typhon, Neph- thys,and Aroueris (Thoth, or Mercury) were grandchildren of the great Jewishpatriarch Noah by his son Ham. But as the story of Noah and his ark is a cosmicallegory concerning the repopulation of planets at the beginning of each worldperiod, this only makes it less likely that they were historical personages.According to Robert Fludd, the sun has three properties—life, light, and heat.These three vivify and vitalize the three worlds—spiritual, intellectual, andmaterial. Therefore, it is said “from one light, three lights,” i. e., the firstthree Master Masons. In all probability, Osiris represents the third, ormaterial, aspect of solar activity, which by its beneficent influences vitalizesand enlivens the flora and fauna of the earth. Osiris is not the sun, but thesun is symbolic of the vital principle of Nature, which the ancients knew asOsiris. His symbol, therefore, was an opened eye, in honor of the Great Eye ofthe universe, the sun. Opposed to the active, radiant principle of impregnatingfire, heat, and motion was the passive, receptive principle of Nature.Modern science has proved that forms ranging in magnitude from solar systems toatoms are composed of positive, radiant nuclei surrounded by negative bodiesthat exist upon the emanations of the central life. From this allegory we havethe story of Solomon and his wives, for Solomon is the sun and his wives andconcubines are the planets, moons, asteroids, and other receptive bodies withinhis house—the solar mansion. Isis, represented in the Song of Solomon by thedark maid of Jerusalem, is symbolic of receptive Nature—the watery, maternalprinciple which creates all things out of herself after impregnation has beenachieved by the virility of the sun.In the ancient world the year had 360 days. The five extra days were gatheredtogether by the God of Cosmic Intelligence to serve as the birthdays of the fivegods and goddesses who are called the sons and daughters of Ham. Upon the firstof these special days Osiris was born and upon the fourth of them Isis. (Thenumber four shows the relation that this goddess bears to the earth and itselements.) Typhon, the Egyptian Demon or Spirit of the Adversary, was born uponthe third day. Typhon is often symbolized by a crocodile; sometimes his body isa combination of crocodile and hog. Isis stands for knowledge and wisdom, andaccording to Plutarch the word Typhon means insolence and pride. Egotism,self-centeredness, and pride are the deadly enemies of understanding and truth.This part of the allegory is revealed.After Osiris, here symbolized as the sun, had become King of Egypt and had givento his people the full advantage of his intellectual light, he continued hispath through the heavens, visiting the peoples of other nations and convertingall with whom he came in contact. Plutarch further asserts that the Greeksrecognized in Osiris the same person whom they revered under the names ofDionysos and Bacchus. While he was away from his country, his brother, Typhon,the Evil One, like the Loki of Scandinavia, plotted against the Sun God todestroy him. Gathering seventy-two persons as fellow conspirators, he attainedhis nefarious end in a most subtle manner. He had a wonderful ornamented boxmade just the size of the body of Osiris. This he brought into a banquet hallwhere the gods and goddesses were feasting together. All admired the beautifulchest, and Typhon promised to give it to the one whose body fitted it mostperfectly. One after another lay down in the box, but in disappointment roseagain, until at last Osiris also tried. The moment he was in the chest Typhonand his accomplices nailed the cover down and sealed the cracks with moltenlead. They then cast the box into the Nile, down which it floated to the sea.Plutarch states that the date upon which this occurred was the seventeenth dayof the month Athyr, when the sun was in the constellation of Scorpio. This ismost significant, for the Scorpion is the symbol of treachery. The time whenOsiris entered the chest was also the same season that Noah entered the ark toescape from the Deluge.Plutarch further declares that the Pans and Satyrs (the Nature spirits andelementals) first discovered that Osiris had been murdered. These immediatelyraised an alarm, and from this incident the word panic, meaning fright oramazement of the multitudes, originated. Isis, upon receiving the news of herhusband’s murder, which she learned from some children who had seen themurderers making off with the box, at once robed herself in mourning and startedforth in quest of him.At length Isis discovered that the chest had floated to the coast of Byblos.There it had lodged in the branches of a tree, which in a short timemiraculously grew up around the box. This so amazed the king of that countrythat he ordered the tree to be cut down and a pillar made from its trunk tosupport the roof of his palace. Isis, visiting Byblos, recovered the body of herhusband, but it was again stolen by Typhon, who cut it into fourteen parts,which he scattered all over the earth. Isis, in despair, began gathering up thesevered remains of her husband, but found only thirteen pieces. The fourteenthpart (the phallus) she reproduced in gold, for the original had fallen into theriver Nile and had been swallowed by a fish.Typhon was later slain in battle by the son of Osiris. Some of the Egyptiansbelieved that the souls of the gods were taken to heaven, where they shone forthas stars. It was supposed that the soul of Isis gleamed from the Dog Star, whileTyphon became the constellation of the Bear. It is doubtful, however, whetherthis idea was ever generally accepted.Among the Egyptians, Isis is often represented with a headdress consisting ofthe empty throne chair of her murdered husband, and this peculiar structure wasaccepted during certain dynasties as her hieroglyphic. The headdresses of theEgyptians have great symbolic and emblematic importance, for they represent theauric bodies of the superhuman intelligences, and are used in the same way thatthe nimbus, halo, and aureole are used in Christian religious art. Frank C.Higgins, a well-known Masonic symbolist, has astutely noted that the ornateheadgears of certain gods and Pharaohs are inclined backward at the same angleas the earth’s axis. The robes, insignia, jewels, and ornamentations of theancient hierophants symbolized the spiritual energies radiating from the humanbody. Modern science is rediscovering many of the lost secrets of Hermeticphilosophy. One of these is the ability to gauge the mental development, thesoul qualities, and the physical health of an individual from the streamers ofsemi-visible electric force which pour through the surface of the skin of everyhuman being at all times during his life. (For details concerning a scientificprocess for making the auric emanations visible, see The Human Atmosphere by Dr.Walter J. Kilner.)Isis is sometimes symbolized by the head of a cow; occasionally the entireanimal is her symbol. The first gods of the Scandinavians were licked out ofblocks of ice by the Mother Cow (Audhumla), who symbolized the principle ofnatural nutriment and fecundity because of her milk. Occasionally Isis isrepresented as a bird. She often carries in one hand the crux ansata, the symbolof eternal life, and in the other the flowered scepter, symbolic of herauthority.Thoth Hermes Trismegistus, the founder of Egyptian learning, the Wise Man of theancient world, gave to the priests and philosophers of antiquity the secretswhich have been preserved to this day in myth and legend. These allegories andemblematic figures conceal the secret formulae for spiritual, mental, moral, andphysical regeneration commonly known as the Mystic Chemistry of the Soul(alchemy). These sublime truths were communicated to the initiates of theMystery Schools, but were concealed from the profane. The latter, unable tounderstand the abstract philosophical tenets, worshiped the concrete sculpturedidols which were emblematic of these secret truths. The wisdom and secrecy ofEgypt are epitomized in the Sphinx, which has preserved its secret from theseekers of a hundred generations. The mysteries of Hermeticism, the greatspiritual truths hidden from the world by the ignorance of the world, and thekeys of the secret doctrines of the ancient philosophers, are all symbolized bythe Virgin Isis. Veiled from head to foot, she reveals her wisdom only to thetried and initiated few who have earned the right to enter her sacred presence,tear from the veiled figure of Nature its shroud of obscurity, and stand face toface with the Divine Reality.The explanations in these pages of the symbols peculiar to the Virgin Isis arebased (unless otherwise noted) on selections from a free translation of thefourth book of Bibliothèque des Philosophes Hermétiques, entitled “TheHermetical Signification of the Symbols and Attributes of Isis,” withinterpolations by the compiler to amplify and clarify the text.The statues of Isis were decorated with the sun, moon, and stars, and manyemblems pertaining to the earth, over which Isis was believed to rule (as theguardian spirit of Nature personified). Several images of the goddess have beenfound upon which the marks of her dignity and position were still intact.According to the ancient philosophers, she personified Universal Nature, themother of all productions. The deity was generally represented as a partly nudewoman, often pregnant, sometimes loosely covered with a garment either of greenor black color, or of four different shades intermingled—black, white, yellow,and red.Apuleius describes her as follows: “In the first place, then, her most copiousand long hairs, being gradually intorted, and promiscuously scattered on herdivine neck, were softly defluous. A multiform crown, consisting of variousflowers, bound the sublime summit of her head. And in the middle of the crown,just on her forehead, there was a smooth orb resembling a mirror, or rather awhite refulgent light, which indicated that she was the moon. Vipers rising upafter the manner of furrows, environed the crown on the right hand and on theleft, and Cerealian ears of corn were also extended from above. Her garment wasof many colours, and woven from the finest flax, and was at one time lucid witha white splendour, at another yellow from the flower of crocus, and at anotherflaming with a rosy redness. But that which most excessively dazzled my sight,was a very black robe, fulgid with a dark splendour, and which, spreading roundand passing under her right side, and ascending to her left shoulder, there roseprotuberant like the center of a shield, the dependent part of the robe fallingin many folds, and having small knots of fringe, gracefully flowing in itsextremities. Glittering stars were dispersed through the embroidered border ofthe robe, and through the whole of its surface: and the full moon, shining inthe middle of the stars, breathed forth flaming fires. Nevertheless, a crown,wholly consisting of flowers and fruits of every kind, adhered with indivisibleconnexion to the border of that conspicuous robe, in all its undulating motions.What she carried in her hands also consisted of things of a very differentnature. For her right hand, indeed, bore a brazen rattle [sistrum] through thenarrow lamina of which bent like a belt, certain rods passing, produced a sharptriple sound, through the vibrating motion of her arm. An oblong vessel, in theshape of a boat, depended from her left hand, on the handle of which, in thatpart in which it was conspicuous, an asp raised its erect head and largelyswelling neck. And shoes woven from the leaves of the victorious palm treecovered her immortal feet.”The green color alludes to the vegetation which covers the face of the earth,and therefore represents the robe of Nature. The black represents death andcorruption as being the way to a new life and generation. “Except a man be bornagain, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John iii. 3.) White, yellow, and redsignify the three principal colors of the alchemical, Hermetical, universalmedicine after the blackness of its putrefaction is over.The ancients gave the name Isis to one of their occult medicines; therefore thedescription here given relates somewhat to chemistry. Her black drape alsosignifies that the moon, or the lunar humidity—the sophic universal mercury andthe operating substance of Nature in alchemical terminology—has no light of itsown, but receives its light, its fire, and its vitalizing force from the sun.Isis was the image or representative of the great works of the wise men: thePhilosopher’s Stone, the Elixir of Life, and the Universal Medicine.Other hieroglyphics seen in connection with Isis are no less curious than thosealready described, but it is impossible to enumerate all, for many symbols wereused interchangeably by the Egyptian Hermetists. The goddess often wore upon herhead a hat made of cypress branches, to signify mourning for her dead husbandand also for the physical death which she caused every creature to undergo inorder to receive a new life in posterity or a periodic resurrection. The head ofIsis is sometimes ornamented with a crown of gold or a garland of olive leaves,as conspicuous marks of her sovereignty as queen of the world and mistress ofthe entire universe. The crown of gold signifies also the aurific unctuosity orsulphurous fatness of the solar and vital fires which she dispenses to everyindividual by a continual circulation of the elements, this circulation beingsymbolized by the musical rattle which she carries in her hand. This sistrum isalso the yonic symbol of purity.A serpent interwoven among the olive leaves on her head, devouring its own tail,denotes that the aurific unctuosity was soiled with the venom of terrestrialcorruption which surrounded it and must be mortified and purified by sevenplanetary circulations or purifications called flying eagles (alchemicalterminology) in order to make it medicinal for the restoration of health. (Herethe emanations from the sun are recognized as a medicine for the healing ofhuman ills.) The seven planetary circulations are represented by thecircumambulations of the Masonic lodge; by the marching of the Jewish priestsseven times around the walls of Jericho, and of the Mohammedan priests seventimes around the Kabba at Mecca. From the crown of gold project three horns ofplenty, signifying the abundance of the gifts of Nature proceeding from one roothaving its origin in the heavens (head of Isis).In this figure the pagan naturalists represent all the vital powers of the threekingdoms and families of sublunary nature—mineral, plant, and animal (manconsidered as an animal). At one of her ears was the moon and at the other thesun, to indicate that these two were the agent and patient, or father and motherprinciples of all natural objects; and that Isis, or Nature, makes use of thesetwo luminaries to communicate her powers to the whole empire of animals,vegetables, and minerals. On the back of her neck were the characters of theplanets and the signs of the zodiac which assisted the planets in theirfunctions. This signified that the heavenly influences directed the destinies ofthe principles and sperms of all things, because they were the governors of allsublunary bodies, which they transformed into little worlds made in the image ofthe greater universe.Isis holds in her right hand a small sailing ship with the spindle of a spinningwheel for its mast. From the top of the mast projects a water jug, its handleshaped like a serpent swelled with venom. This indicates that Isis steers thebark of life, full of troubles and miseries, on the stormy ocean of Time. Thespindle symbolizes the fact that she spins and cuts the thread of Life. Theseemblems further signify that Isis abounds in humidity, by means of which shenourishes all natural bodies, preserving them from the heat of the sun byhumidifying them with nutritious moisture from the atmosphere. Moisture supportsvegetation, but this subtle humidity (life ether) is always more or lessinfected by some venom proceeding from corruption or decay. It must be purifiedby being brought into contact with the invisible cleansing fire of Nature. Thisfire digests, perfects, and revitalizes this substance, in order that thehumidity may become a universal medicine to heal and renew all the bodies inNature.The serpent throws off its skin annually and is thereby renewed (symbolic of theresurrection of the spiritual life from the material nature). This renewal ofthe earth takes place every spring, when the vivifying spirit of the sun returnsto the countries of the Northern Hemisphere.The symbolic Virgin carries in her left hand a sistrum and a cymbal, or squareframe of metal, which when struck gives the keynote of Nature (Fa); sometimesalso an olive branch, to indicate the harmony she preserves among natural thingswith her regenerating power. By the processes of death and corruption she giveslife to a number of creatures of diverse forms through periods of perpetualchange. The cymbal is made square instead of the usual triangular shape in orderto symbolize that all things are transmuted and regenerated according to theharmony of the four elements.Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom believed that if a physician could establish harmonyamong the elements of earth, fire, air, and water, and unite them into a stone(the Philosopher’s Stone) symbolized by the six-pointed star or two interlacedtriangles, he would possess the means of healing all disease. Dr. Bacstromfurther stated that there was no doubt in his mind that the universal,omnipresent fire (spirit) of Nature “does all and is all in all.” By attraction,repulsion, motion, heat, sublimation, evaporation, exsiccation, inspissation,coagulation, and fixation, the Universal Fire (Spirit) manipulates matter, andmanifests throughout creation. Any individual who can understand theseprinciples and adapt them to the three departments of Nature becomes a truephilosopher.From the right breast of Isis protruded a bunch of grapes and from the left anear of corn or a sheaf of wheat, golden in color. These indicate that Nature isthe source of nutrition for plant, animal, and human life, nourishing all thingsfrom herself. The golden color in the wheat (corn) indicates that in thesunlight or spiritual gold is concealed the first sperm of all life.On the girdle surrounding the upper part of the body of the statue appear anumber of mysterious emblems. The girdle is joined together in front by fourgolden plates (the elements), placed in the form of a square. This signifiedthat Isis, or Nature, the first matter (alchemical terminology), was the essenceof the four elements (life, light, heat, and force), which quintessencegenerated all things. Numerous stars are represented on this girdle, therebyindicating their influence in darkness as well as the influence of the sun inlight. Isis is the Virgin immortalized in the constellation of Virgo, where theWorld Mother is placed with the serpent under her feet and a crown of stars onher head. In her arms she carries a sheaf of grain and sometimes the young SunGod.The statue of Isis was placed on a pedestal of dark stone ornamented with rams’heads. Her feet trod upon a number of venomous reptiles. This indicates thatNature has power to free from acidity or saltness all corrosives and to overcomeall impurities from terrestrial corruption adhering to bodies. The rams’ headsindicate that the most auspicious time for the generation of life is during theperiod when the sun passes through the sign of Aries. The serpents under herfeet indicate that Nature is inclined to preserve life and to heal disease byexpelling impurities and corruption.In this sense the axioms known to the ancient philosophers are verified; namely:> Nature contains Nature;> Nature rejoices in her own nature;> Nature surmounts Nature;> Nature cannot be amended but in her own nature. Therefore, in contemplating the statue of Isis, we must not lose sight of theoccult sense of its allegories; otherwise, the Virgin remains an inexplicableenigma.From a golden ring on her left arm a line descends, to the end of which issuspended a deep box filled with flaming coals and incense. Isis, or Naturepersonified, carries with her the sacred fire, religiously preserved and keptburning in a special temple by the vestal virgins. This fire is the genuine,immortal flame of Nature—ethereal, essential, the author of life. Theinconsumable oil, the balsam of life, so much praised by the wise and so oftenreferred to in the Scriptures, is frequently symbolized as the fuel of thisimmortal flame.From the right arm of the figure also descends a thread, to the end of which isfastened a pair of scales, to denote the exactitude of Nature in her weights andmeasures. Isis is often represented as the symbol of Justice, because Nature iseternally consistent.The World Virgin is sometimes shown standing between two great pillars—theJachin and Boaz of Freemasonry—symbolizing the fact that Nature attainsproductivity by means of polarity. As wisdom personified, Isis stands betweenthe pillars of opposites, demonstrating that understanding is always found atthe point of equilibrium and that truth is often crucified between the twothieves of apparent contradiction.The sheen of gold in her dark hair indicates that while she is lunar, her poweris due to the sun’s rays, from which she secures her ruddy complexion. As themoon is robed in the reflected light of the sun, so Isis, like the virgin ofRevelation, is clothed in the glory of solar luminosity. Apuleius states thatwhile he was sleeping he beheld the venerable goddess Isis rising out of theocean. The ancients realized that the primary forms of life first came out ofwater, and modern science concurs in this view. H. G. Wells, in his Outline ofHistory, describing primitive life on the earth, states: “But though the oceanand inter-tidal water already swarmed with life, the land above the high-tideline was still, so far as we can guess, a stony wilderness without a trace oflife.” In the next chapter he adds: “Wherever the shore-line ran there was life,and that life went on in and by and with water as its home, its medium, and itsfundamental necessity.” The ancients believed that the universal sperm proceededwith warm vapor, humid but fiery. The veiled Isis, whose very coveringsrepresent vapor, is symbolic of this humidity, which is the carrier or vehiclefor the sperm life of the sun, represented by a child in her arms. Because thesun, moon, and stars in setting appear to sink into the sea and also because thewater receives their rays into itself, the sea was believed to be the breedingground for the sperm of living things. The sperm is generated from thecombination of the influences of the celestial bodies; hence Isis is sometimesrepresented as pregnant.Frequently the statue of Isis was accompanied by the figure of a large black andwhite ox. The ox represents either Osiris as Taurus, the bull of the zodiac, orApis, an animal sacred to Osiris because of its peculiar markings and colorings.Among the Egyptians, the bull was a beast of burden. Hence the presence of theanimal was a reminder of the labors patiently performed by Nature that allcreatures may have life and health. Harpocrates, the God of Silence, holding hisfingers to his mouth, often accompanies the statue of Isis. He warns all to keepthe secrets of the wise from those unfit to know them.The Druids of Britain and Gaul had a deep knowledge concerning the mysteries ofIsis and worshiped her under the symbol of the moon. Godfrey Higgins considersit a mistake to regard Isis as synonymous with the moon. The moon was chosen forIsis because of its dominion over water. The Druids considered the sun to be thefather and the moon the mother of all things. By means of these symbols theyworshiped Universal Nature.The figure of Isis is sometimes used to represent the occult and magical arts,such as necromancy, invocation, sorcery, and thaumaturgy. In one of the mythsconcerning her, Isis is said to have conjured the invincible God of Eternities,Ra, to tell her his secret and sacred name, which he did. This name isequivalent to the Lost Word of Masonry. By means of this Word, a magician candemand obedience from the invisible and superior deities. The priests of Isisbecame adepts in the use of the unseen forces of Nature. They understoodhypnotism, mesmerism, and similar practices long before the modern world dreamedof their existence.Plutarch describes the requisites of a follower of Isis in this manner: “For as’tis not the length of the beard, or the coarseness of the habit which makes aphilosopher, so neither will those frequent shavings, or the mere wearing [of] alinen vestment constitute a votary of Isis; but he alone is a true servant orfollower of this Goddess, who after he has heard, and been made acquainted in aproper manner with the history of the actions of these Gods, searches into thehidden truths which lie concealed under them, and examines the whole by thedictates of reason and philosophy.”During the Middle Ages the troubadours of Central Europe preserved in song thelegends of this Egyptian goddess. They composed sonnets to the most beautifulwoman in the world. Though few ever discovered her identity, she was Sophia, theVirgin of Wisdom, whom all the philosophers of the world have wooed. Isisrepresents the mystery of motherhood, which the ancients recognized as the mostapparent proof of Nature’s omniscient wisdom and God’s overshadowing power. Tothe modern seeker she is the epitome of the Great Unknown, and only those whounveil her will be able to solve the mysteries of life, death, generation, andregeneration."},{"pageContent":"MUMMIFICATION OF THE EGYPTIAN DEAD Servius, commenting on Virgil’s Æneid, observes that “the wise Egyptians tookcare to embalm their bodies, and deposit them in catacombs, in order that thesoul might be preserved for a long time in connection with the body, and mightnot soon be alienated; while the Romans, with an opposite design, committed theremains of their dead to the funeral pyre, intending that the vital spark mightimmediately be restored to the general element, or return to its pristinenature.” (From Prichard’s An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology.)No complete records are available which give the secret doctrine of theEgyptians concerning the relationship existing between the spirit, orconsciousness, and the body which it inhabited. It is reasonably certain,however, that Pythagoras, who had been initiated in the Egyptian temples, whenhe promulgated the doctrine of metempsychosis, restated, in part at least, theteachings of the Egyptian initiates. The popular supposition that the Egyptiansmummified their dead in order to preserve the form for a physical resurrectionis untenable in the light of modern knowledge regarding their philosophy ofdeath. In the fourth book of On Abstinence from Animal Food, Porphyry describesan Egyptian custom of purifying the dead by removing the contents of theabdominal cavity, which they placed in a separate chest. He then reproduces thefollowing oration which had been translated out of the Egyptian tongue byEuphantus: “O sovereign Sun, and all ye Gods who impart life to men, receive me,and deliver me to the eternal Gods as a cohabitant. For I have always piouslyworshipped those divinities which were pointed out to me by my parents as longas I lived in this age, and have likewise always honored those who procreated mybody. And, with respect to other men, I have never slain any one, nor defraudedany one of what he deposited with me, nor have I committed any other atrociousdeed. If, therefore, during my life I have acted erroneously, by eating ordrinking things which it is unlawful to eat or drink, I have not erred throughmyself, but through these” (pointing to the chest which contained the viscera).The removal of the organs identified as the seat of the appetites was consideredequivalent to the purification of the body from their evil influences.So literally did the early Christians interpret their Scriptures that theypreserved the bodies of their dead by pickling them in salt water, so that onthe day of resurrection the spirit of the dead might reenter a complete andperfectly preserved body. Believing that the incisions necessary to theembalming process and the removal of the internal organs would prevent thereturn of the spirit to its body, the Christians buried their dead withoutresorting to the more elaborate mummification methods employed by the Egyptianmorticians.In his work on Egyptian Magic, S.S.D.D. hazards the following speculationconcerning the esoteric purposes behind the practice of mummification. “There isevery reason to suppose,” he says, “that only those who had received some gradeof initiation were mummified; for it is certain that, in the eyes of theEgyptians, mummification effectually prevented reincarnation. Reincarnation wasnecessary to imperfect souls, to those who had failed to pass the tests ofinitiation; but for those who had the Will and the capacity to enter the SecretAdytum, there was seldom necessity for that liberation of the soul which is saidto be effected by the destruction of the body. The body of the Initiate wastherefore preserved after death as a species of Talisman or material basis forthe manifestation of the Soul upon earth.”During the period of its inception mummification was limited to the Pharaoh andsuch other persons of royal rank as presumably partook of the attributes of thegreat Osiris, the divine, mummified King of the Egyptian Underworld."},{"pageContent":"IX The Sun, a Universal Deity The adoration of the sun was one of the earliest and most natural forms ofreligious expression. Complex modern theologies are merely involvements andamplifications of this simple aboriginal belief. The primitive mind, recognizingthe beneficent power of the solar orb, adored it as the proxy of the SupremeDeity. Concerning the origin of sun worship, Albert Pike makes the followingconcise statement in his Morals and Dogma: “To them [aboriginal peoples] he [thesun] was the innate fire of bodies, the fire of Nature. Author of Life, heat,and ignition, he was to them the efficient cause of all generation, for withouthim there was no movement, no existence, no form. He was to them immense,indivisible, imperishable, and everywhere present. It was their need of light,and of his creative energy, that was felt by all men; and nothing was morefearful to them than his absence. His beneficent influences caused hisidentification with the Principle of Good; and the BRAHMA of the Hindus, andMITHRAS of the Persians, and ATHOM, AMUN, PHTHA, and OSIRIS, of the Egyptians,the BEL of the Chaldeans, the ADONAI of the Phoenicians, the ADONIS and APOLLOof the Greeks, became but personifications of the Sun, the regeneratingPrinciple, image of that fecundity which perpetuates and rejuvenates the world’sexistence.”Among all the nations of antiquity, altars, mounds, and temples were dedicatedto the worship of the orb of day. The ruins of these sacred places yet remain,notable among them being the pyramids of Yucatan and Egypt, the snake mounds ofthe American Indians, the Zikkurats of Babylon and Chaldea, the round towers ofIreland, and the massive rings of uncut stone in Britain and Normandy. The Towerof Babel, which, according to the Scriptures, was built so that man might reachup to God, was probably an astronomical observatory.017 [images/00018.jpg] THE WINGED GLOBE OF EGYPT.This symbol, which appears over the pylons or gates of many Egyptian palaces andtemples, is emblematic of the three persons of the Egyptian Trinity. The wings,the serpents, and the solar orb are the insignia of Ammon, Ra, and Osiris. Many early priests and prophets, both pagan and Christian, were versed inastronomy and astrology; their writings are best understood when read in thelight of these ancient sciences. With the growth of man’s knowledge of theconstitution and periodicity of the heavenly bodies, astronomical principles andterminology were introduced into his religious systems. The tutelary gods weregiven planetary thrones, the celestial bodies being named after the deitiesassigned to them. The fixed stars were divided into constellations, and throughthese constellations wandered the sun and its planets, the latter with theiraccompanying satellites."},{"pageContent":"THE SOLAR TRINITY The sun, as supreme among the celestial bodies visible to the astronomers ofantiquity, was assigned to the highest of the gods and became symbolic of thesupreme authority of the Creator Himself. From a deep philosophic considerationof the powers and principles of the sun has come the concept of the Trinity asit is understood in the world today. The tenet of a Triune Divinity is notpeculiar to Christian or Mosaic theology, but forms a conspicuous part of thedogma of the greatest religions of both ancient and modern times. The Persians,Hindus, Babylonians, and Egyptians had their Trinities. In every instance theserepresented the threefold form of one Supreme Intelligence. In modern Masonry,the Deity is symbolized by an equilateral triangle, its three sides representingthe primary manifestations of the Eternal One who is Himself represented as atiny flame, called by the Hebrews Yod (٬). Jakob Böhme, the Teutonic mystic,calls the Trinity The Three Witnesses, by means of which the Invisible is madeknown to the visible, tangible universe.The origin of the Trinity is obvious to anyone who will observe the dailymanifestations of the sun. This orb, being the symbol of all Light, has threedistinct phases: rising, midday, and setting. The philosophers therefore dividedthe life of all things into three distinct parts: growth, maturity, and decay.Between the twilight of dawn and the twilight of evening is the high noon ofresplendent glory. God the Father, the Creator of the world, is symbolized bythe dawn. His color is blue, because the sun rising in the morning is veiled inblue mist. God the Son, the Illuminating One sent to bear witness of His Fatherbefore all worlds, is the celestial globe at noonday, radiant and magnificent,the maned Lion of Judah, the Golden-haired Savior of the World. Yellow is Hiscolor and His power is without end. God the Holy Ghost is the sunset phase, whenthe orb of day, robed in flaming red, rests for a moment upon the horizon lineand then vanishes into the darkness of the night to wander in the lower worldsand later rise again triumphant from the embrace of darkness.To the Egyptians the sun was the symbol of immortality, for, while it died eachnight, it rose again with each ensuing dawn. Not only has the sun this diurnalactivity, but it also has its annual pilgrimage, during which time it passessuccessively through the twelve celestial houses of the heavens, remaining ineach for thirty days. Added to these it has a third path of travel, which iscalled the precession of the equinoxes, in which it retrogrades around thezodiac through the twelve signs at the rate of one degree every seventy-twoyears.Concerning the annual passage of the sun through the twelve houses of theheavens, Robert Hewitt Brown, 32°, makes the following statement: “The Sun, ashe pursued his way among these ‘living creatures’ of the zodiac, was said, inallegorical language, either to assume the nature of or to triumph over the signhe entered. The sun thus became a Bull in Taurus, and was worshipped as such bythe Egyptians under the name of Apis, and by the Assyrians as Bel, Baal, or Bul.In Leo the sun became a Lion-slayer, Hercules, and an Archer in Sagittarius. InPisces, the Fishes, he was a fish—Dagon, or Vishnu, the fish-god of thePhilistines and Hindoos.”A careful analysis of the religious systems of pagandom uncovers much evidenceof the fact that its priests served the solar energy and that their SupremeDeity was in every case this Divine Light personified. Godfrey Higgins, afterthirty years of inquiry into the origin of religious beliefs, is of the opinionthat “All the Gods of antiquity resolved themselves into the solar fire,sometimes itself as God, or sometimes an emblem or shekinah of that higherprinciple, known by the name of the creative Being or God.”The Egyptian priests in many of their ceremonies wore the skins of lions, whichwere symbols of the solar orb, owing to the fact that the sun is exalted,dignified, and most fortunately placed in the constellation of Leo, which herules and which was at one time the keystone of the celestial arch. Again,Hercules is the Solar Deity, for as this mighty hunter performed his twelvelabors, so the sun, in traversing the twelve houses of the zodiacal band,performs during his pilgrimage twelve essential and benevolent labors for thehuman race and for Nature in general. Hercules, like the Egyptian priests, worethe skin of a lion for a girdle. Samson, the Hebrew hero, as his name implies,is also a solar deity. His fight with the Nubian lion, his battles with thePhilistines, who represent the Powers of Darkness, and his memorable feat ofcarrying off the gates of Gaza, all refer to aspects of solar activity. Many ofthe ancient peoples had more than one solar deity; in fact, all of the gods andgoddesses were supposed to partake, in part at least, of the sun’s effulgence.The golden ornaments used by the priestcraft of the various world religions areagain a subtle reference to the solar energy, as are also the crowns of kings.In ancient times, crowns had a number of points extending outward like the raysof the sun, but modern conventionalism has, in many cases, either removed thepoints or else bent them inward, gathered them together, and placed an orb orcross upon the point where they meet. Many of the ancient prophets,philosophers, and dignitaries carried a scepter, the upper end of which bore arepresentation of the solar globe surrounded by emanating rays. All the kingdomsof earth were but copies of the kingdoms of Heaven, and the kingdoms of Heavenwere best symbolized by the solar kingdom, in which the sun was the supremeruler, the planets his privy council, and all Nature the subjects of his empire.Many deities have been associated with the sun. The Greeks believed that Apollo,Bacchus, Dionysos, Sabazius, Hercules, Jason, Ulysses, Zeus, Uranus, and Vulcanpartook of either the visible or invisible attributes of the sun. The Norwegiansregarded Balder the Beautiful as a solar deity, and Odin is often connected withthe celestial orb, especially because of his one eye. Among the Egyptians,Osiris, Ra, Anubis, Hermes, and even the mysterious Ammon himself had points ofresemblance with the solar disc. Isis was the mother of the sun, and evenTyphon, the Destroyer, was supposed to be a form of solar energy. The Egyptiansun myth finally centered around the person of a mysterious deity calledSerapis. The two Central American deities, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, whileoften associated with the winds, were also undoubtedly solar gods.In Masonry the sun has many symbols. One expression of the solar energy isSolomon, whose name SOL-OM-ON is the name for the Supreme Light in threedifferent languages. Hiram Abiff, the CHiram (Hiram) of the Chaldees, is also asolar deity, and the story of his attack and murder by the Ruffians, with itssolar interpretation, will be found in the chapter The Hiramic Legend. Astriking example of the important part which the sun plays in the symbols andrituals of Freemasonry is given by George Oliver, D.D., in his Dictionary ofSymbolical Masonry, as follows:“The sun rises in the east, and in the east is the place for the WorshipfulMaster. As the sun is the source of all light and warmth, so should theWorshipful Master enliven and warm the brethren to their work. Among the ancientEgyptians the sun was the symbol of divine providence.” The hierophants of theMysteries were adorned with many insignia emblematic of solar power. Thesunbursts of gilt embroidery on the back of the vestments of the Catholicpriesthood signify that the priest is also an emissary and representative of SolInvictus."},{"pageContent":"CHRISTIANITY AND THE SUN For reasons which they doubtless considered sufficient, those who chronicled thelife and acts of Jesus found it advisable to metamorphose him into a solardeity. The historical Jesus was forgotten; nearly all the salient incidentsrecorded in the four Gospels have their correlations in the movements, phases,or functions of the heavenly bodies.Among other allegories borrowed by Christianity from pagan antiquity is thestory of the beautiful, blue-eyed Sun God, with His golden hair falling upon Hisshoulders, robed from head to foot in spotless white and carrying in His armsthe Lamb of God, symbolic of the vernal equinox. This handsome youth is acomposite of Apollo, Osiris, Orpheus, Mithras, and Bacchus, for He has certaincharacteristics in common with each of these pagan deities.The philosophers of Greece and Egypt divided the life of the sun during the yearinto four parts; therefore they symbolized the Solar Man by four differentfigures. When He was born in the winter solstice, the Sun God was symbolized asa dependent infant who in some mysterious manner had managed to escape thePowers of Darkness seeking to destroy Him while He was still in the cradle ofwinter. The sun, being weak at this season of the year, had no golden rays (orlocks of hair), but the survival of the light through the darkness of winter wassymbolized by one tiny hair which alone adorned the head of the Celestial Child.(As the birth of the sun took place in Capricorn, it was often represented asbeing suckled by a goat.)At the vernal equinox, the sun had grown to be a beautiful youth. His goldenhair hung in ringlets on his shoulders and his light, as Schiller said, extendedto all parts of infinity. At the summer solstice, the sun became a strong man,heavily bearded, who, in the prime of maturity, symbolized the fact that Natureat this period of the year is strongest and most fecund. At the autumnalequinox, the sun was pictured as an aged man, shuffling along with bended backand whitened locks into the oblivion of winter darkness. Thus, twelve monthswere assigned to the sun as the length of its life. During this period itcircled the twelve signs of the zodiac in a magnificent triumphal march. Whenfall came, it entered, like Samson, into the house of Delilah (Virgo), where itsrays were cut off and it lost its strength. In Masonry, the cruel winter monthsare symbolized by three murderers who sought to destroy the God of Light andTruth.The coming of the sun was hailed with joy; the time of its departure was viewedas a period to be set aside for sorrow and unhappiness. This glorious, radiantorb of day, the true light “which lighteth every man who cometh into the world,”the supreme benefactor, who raised all things from the dead, who fed the hungrymultitudes, who stilled the tempest, who after dying rose again and restored allthings to life—this Supreme Spirit of humanitarianism and philanthropy is knownto Christendom as Christ, the Redeemer of worlds, the Only Begotten of TheFather, the Word made Flesh, and the Hope of Glory."},{"pageContent":"THE BIRTHDAY OF THE SUN The pagans set aside the 25th of December as the birthday of the Solar Man. Theyrejoiced, feasted, gathered in processions, and made offerings in the temples.The darkness of winter was over and the glorious son of light was returning tothe Northern Hemisphere. With his last effort the old Sun God had torn down thehouse of the Philistines (the Spirits of Darkness) and had cleared the way forthe new sun who was born that day from the depths of the earth amidst thesymbolic beasts of the lower world.Concerning this season of celebration, an anonymous Master of Arts of BalliolCollege, Oxford, in his scholarly treatise, Mankind—Their Origin and Destiny,says: “The Romans also had their solar festival, and their games of the circusin honor of the birth of the god of day. It took place the eighth day before thekalends of January—that is, on December 25. Servius, in his commentary on verse720 of the seventh book of the Æneid, in which Virgil speaks of the new sun,says that, properly speaking, the sun is new on the 8th of the Kalends ofJanuary—that is, December 25. In the time of Leo I. (Leo, Serm. xxi., De Nativ.Dom. p. 148), some of the Fathers of the Church said that ‘what rendered thefestival (of Christmas) venerable was less the birth of Jesus Christ than thereturn, and, as they expressed it, the new birth of the sun.’ It was on the sameday that the birth of the Invincible Sun (Natalis solis invicti), was celebratedat Rome, as can be seen in the Roman calendars, published in the reign ofConstantine and of Julian (Hymn to the Sun, p. 155). This epithet ‘Invictus’ isthe same as the Persians gave to this same god, whom they worshipped by the nameof Mithra, and whom they caused to be born in a grotto (Justin. Dial. cum Tryph.p. 305), just as he is represented as being born in a stable, under the name ofChrist, by the Christians.”Concerning the Catholic Feast of the Assumption and its parallel in astronomy,the same author adds: “At the end of eight months, when the sun-god, havingincreased, traverses the eighth sign, he absorbs the celestial Virgin in hisfiery course, and she disappears in the midst of the luminous rays and the gloryof her son. This phenomenon, which takes place every year about the middle ofAugust, gave rise to a festival which still exists, and in which it is supposedthat the mother of Christ, laying aside her earthly life, is associated with theglory of her son, and is placed at his side in the heavens. The Roman calendarof Columella (Col. 1. II. cap. ii. p. 429) marks the death or disappearance ofVirgo at this period. The sun, he says, passes into Virgo on the thirteenth daybefore the kalends of September. This is where the Catholics place the Feast ofthe Assumption, or the reunion of the Virgin to her Son. This feast was formerlycalled the feast of the Passage of the Virgin (Beausobre, tome i. p. 350); andin the Library of the Fathers (Bibl. Patr. vol. II. part ii. p. 212) we have anaccount of the Passage of the Blessed Virgin. The ancient Greeks and Romans fixthe assumption of Astraea, who is also this same Virgin, on that day.”This Virgin mother, giving birth to the Sun God which Christianity has sofaithfully preserved, is a reminder of the inscription concerning her Egyptianprototype, Isis, which appeared on the Temple of Sais: “The fruit which l havebrought forth is the Sun.” While the Virgin was associated with the moon by theearly pagans, there is no doubt that they also understood her position as aconstellation in the heavens, for nearly all the peoples of antiquity credit heras being the mother of the sun, and they realized that although the moon couldnot occupy that position, the sign of Virgo could, and did, give birth to thesun out of her side on the 25th day of December. Albertus Magnus states, “Weknow that the sign of the Celestial Virgin rose over the Horizon at the momentat which we fix the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.”Among certain of the Arabian and Persian astronomers the three stars forming thesword belt of Orion were called the Magi who came to pay homage to the young SunGod. The author of Mankind—Their Origin and Destiny contributes the followingadditional information: “In Cancer, which had risen to the meridian at midnight,is the constellation of the Stable and of the Ass. The ancients called itPræsepe Jovis. In the north the stars of the Bear are seen, called by theArabians Martha and Mary, and also the coffin of Lazarus.” Thus the esotericismof pagandom was embodied in Christianity, although its keys are lost. TheChristian church blindly follows ancient customs, and when asked for a reasongives superficial and unsatisfactory explanations, either forgetting or ignoringthe indisputable fact that each religion is based upon the secret doctrines ofits predecessor.018 [images/00019.jpg] SURYA, THE REGENT OF THE SUN.Moor describes this figure as follows: “The cast is nine inches in height,representing the glorious god of day holding the attributes of VISHNU, seated ona seven-headed serpent; his car drawn by a seven-headed horse, driven by thelegless ARUN, a personification of the dawn, or AURORA.” (See Moor’s HinduPantheon.)"},{"pageContent":"THE THREE SUNS The solar orb, like the nature of man, was divided by the ancient sages intothree separate bodies. According to the mystics, there are three suns in eachsolar system, analogous to the three centers of life in each individualconstitution. These are called three lights: the spiritual sun, the intellectualor soular sun, and the material sun (now symbolized in Freemasonry by threecandles). The spiritual sun manifests the power of God the Father; the soularsun radiates the life of God the Son; and the material sun is the vehicle ofmanifestation for God the Holy Spirit. Man’s nature was divided by the mysticsinto three distinct parts: spirit, soul, and body. His physical body wasunfolded and vitalized by the material sun; his spiritual nature was illuminatedby the spiritual sun; and his intellectual nature was redeemed by the true lightof grace—the soular sun. The alignment of these three globes in the heavens wasone explanation offered for the peculiar fact that the orbits of the planets arenot circular but elliptical.The pagan priests always considered the solar system as a Grand Man, and drewtheir analogy of these three centers of activity from the three main centers oflife in the human body: the brain, the heart, and the generative system. TheTransfiguration of Jesus describes three tabernacles, the largest being in thecenter (the heart), and a smaller one on either side (the brain and thegenerative system). It is possible that the philosophical hypothesis of theexistence of the three suns is based upon a peculiar natural phenomenon whichhas occurred many times in history. In the fifty-first year after Christ threesuns were seen at once in the sky and also in the sixty-sixth year. In thesixty-ninth year, two suns were seen together. According to William Lilly,between the years 1156 and 1648 twenty similar occurrences were recorded.Recognizing the sun as the supreme benefactor of the material world, Hermetistsbelieved that there was a spiritual sun which ministered to the needs of theinvisible and divine part of Nature—human and universal. Anent this subject, thegreat Paracelsus wrote: “There is an earthly sun, which is the cause of allheat, and all who are able to see may see the sun; and those who are blind andcannot see him may feel his heat. There is an Eternal Sun, which is the sourceof all wisdom, and those whose spiritual senses have awakened to life will seethat sun and be conscious of His existence; but those who have not attainedspiritual consciousness may yet feel His power by an inner faculty which iscalled Intuition.”Certain Rosicrucian scholars have given special appellations to these threephases of the sun: the spiritual sun they called Vulcan; the soular andintellectual sun, Christ and Lucifer respectively; and the material sun, theJewish Demiurgus Jehovah. Lucifer here represents the intellectual mind withoutthe illumination of the spiritual mind; therefore it is “the false light.” Thefalse light is finally overcome and redeemed by the true light of the soul,called the Second Logos or Christ. The secret processes by which the Luciferianintellect is transmuted into the Christly intellect constitute one of the greatsecrets of alchemy, and are symbolized by the process of transmuting base metalsinto gold.In the rare treatise, The Secret Symbols of The Rosicrucians, Franz Hartmanndefines the sun alchemically as: “The symbol of Wisdom. The Centre of Power orHeart of things. The Sun is a centre of energy and a storehouse of power. Eachliving being contains within itself a centre of life, which may grow to be aSun. In the heart of the regenerated, the divine power, stimulated by the Lightof the Logos, grows into a Sun which illuminates his mind.” In a note, the sameauthor amplifies his description by adding: “The terrestrial sun is the image orreflection of the invisible celestial sun; the former is in the realm of Spiritwhat the latter is in the realm of Matter; but the latter receives its powerfrom the former.”In the majority of cases, the religions of antiquity agree that the materialvisible sun was a reflector rather than a source of power. The sun was sometimesrepresented as a shield carried on the arm of the Sun God, as for example, Frey,the Scandinavian Solar Deity. This sun reflected the light of the invisiblespiritual sun, which was the true source of life, light, and truth. The physicalnature of the universe is receptive; it is a realm of effects. The invisiblecauses of these effects belong to the spiritual world. Hence, the spiritualworld is the sphere of causation; the material world is the sphere of effects;while the intellectual—or soul—world is the sphere of mediation. Thus Christ,the personified higher intellect and soul nature, is called “the Mediator” who,by virtue of His position and power, says: “No man cometh to the Father, but byme.”What the sun is to the solar system, the spirit is to the bodies of man; for hisnatures, organs, and functions are as planets surrounding the central life (orsun) and living upon its emanations. The solar power in man is divided intothree parts, which are termed the threefold human spirit of man. All three ofthese spiritual natures are said to be radiant and transcendent; united, theyform the Divinity in man. Man’s threefold lower nature—consisting of hisphysical organism, his emotional nature, and his mental faculties—reflects thelight of his threefold Divinity and bears witness of It in the physical world.Man’s three bodies are symbolized by an upright triangle; his threefoldspiritual nature by an inverted triangle. These two triangles, when united inthe form of a six-pointed star, were called by the Jews “the Star of David,”“the Signet of Solomon,” and are more commonly known today as “the Star ofZion.” These triangles symbolize the spiritual and material universes linkedtogether in the constitution of the human creature, who partakes of both Natureand Divinity. Man’s animal nature partakes of the earth; his divine nature ofthe heavens; his human nature of the mediator."},{"pageContent":"THE CELESTIAL INHABITANTS OF THE SUN The Rosicrucians and the Illuminati, describing the angels, archangels, andother celestial creatures, declared that they resembled small suns, beingcenters of radiant energy surrounded by streamers of Vrilic force. From theseoutpouring streamers of force is derived the popular belief that angels havewings. These wings are corona-like fans of light, by means of which thecelestial creatures propel themselves through the subtle essences of thesuperphysical worlds.True mystics are unanimous in their denial of the theory that the angels andarchangels are human in form, as so often pictured. A human figure would beutterly useless in the ethereal substances through which they manifest. Sciencehas long debated the probability of the other planets being inhabited.Objections to the idea are based upon the argument that creatures with humanorganisms could not possibly exist in the environments of Mars, Jupiter, Uranus,and Neptune. This argument fails to take into account Nature’s universal law ofadjustment to environment. The ancients asserted that life originated from thesun, and that everything when bathed in the light of the solar orb was capableof absorbing the solar life elements and later radiating them as flora andfauna. One philosophical concept regarded the sun as a parent and the planets asembryos still connected to the solar body by means of ethereal umbilical cordswhich served as channels to convey life and nourishment to the planets.Some secret orders have taught that the sun was inhabited by a race of creatureswith bodies composed of a radiant, spiritual ether not unlike in itsconstituency the actual glowing ball of the sun itself. The solar heat had noharmful effect upon them, because their organisms were sufficiently refined andsensitized to harmonize with the sun’s tremendous vibratory rate. Thesecreatures resemble miniature suns, being a little larger than a dinner plate insize, although some of the more powerful are considerably larger. Their color isthe golden white light of the sun, and from them emanate four streamers of Vril.These streamers are often of great length and are in constant motion. A peculiarpalpitation is to be noted throughout the structure of the globe and iscommunicated in the form of ripples to the emanating streamers. The greatest andmost luminous of these spheres is the Archangel Michael; and the entire order ofsolar life, which resemble him and dwell upon the sun, are called by modernChristians “the archangels” or “the spirits of the light.”"},{"pageContent":"THE SUN IN ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLOGY Gold is the metal of the sun and has been considered by many as crystallizedsunlight. When gold is mentioned in alchemical tracts, it may be either themetal itself or the celestial orb which is the source, or spirit, of gold.Sulphur because of in fiery nature was also associated with the sun.As gold was the symbol of spirit and the base metals represented man’s lowernature, certain alchemists were called “miners” and were pictured with picks andshovels digging into the earth in search of the precious metal—those finertraits of character buried in the earthiness of materiality and ignorance. Thediamond concealed in the heart of the black carbon illustrated the sameprinciple. The Illuminati used a pearl hidden in the shell of an oyster at thebottom of the sea to signify spiritual powers. Thus the seeker after truthbecame a pearl-fisher: he descended into the sea of material illusion in searchof understanding, termed by the initiates “the Pearl of Great Price.”When the alchemists stated that every animate and inanimate thing in theuniverse contained the seeds of gold, they meant that even the grains of sandpossessed a spiritual nature, for gold was the spirit of all things. Concerningthese seeds of spiritual gold the following Rosicrucian axiom is significant: “Aseed is useless and impotent unless it is put in its appropriate matrix.” FranzHartmann comments on this axiom with these illuminating words: “A soul cannotdevelop and progress without an appropriate body, because it is the physicalbody that furnishes the material for its development.” (See In the Pronaos ofthe Temple of Wisdom.)The purpose of alchemy was not to make something out of nothing but rather tofertilize and nurture the seed which was already present. Its processes did notactually create gold but rather made the ever-present seed of gold grow andflourish. Everything which exists has a spirit—the seed of Divinity withinitself—and regeneration is not the process of attempting to place somethingwhere it previously had not existed. Regeneration actually means the unfoldmentof the omnipresent Divinity in man, that this Divinity may shine forth as a sunand illumine all with whom it comes in contact."},{"pageContent":"THE MIDNIGHT SUN Apuleius said when describing his initiation (vide ante): “At midnight I saw thesun shining with a splendid light.” The midnight sun was also part of themystery of alchemy. It symbolized the spirit in man shining through the darknessof his human organisms. It also referred to the spiritual sun in the solarsystem, which the mystic could see as well at midnight as at high noon, thematerial earth being powerless to obstruct the rays of this Divine orb. Themysterious lights which illuminated the temples of the Egyptian Mysteries duringthe nocturnal hours were said by some to be reflections of the spiritual sungathered by the magical powers of the priests. The weird light seen ten milesbelow the surface of the earth by I-AM-THE-MAN in that remarkable Masonicallegory Etidorhpa (Aphrodite spelt backward) may well refer to the mysteriousmidnight sun of the ancient rites.Primitive conceptions concerning the warfare between the principles of Good andEvil were often based upon the alternations of day and night. During the MiddleAges, the practices of black magic were confined to the nocturnal hours; andthose who served the Spirit of Evil were called black magicians, while those whoserved the Spirit of Good were called white magicians. Black and white wereassociated respectively with night and day, and the endless conflict of lightand shadow is alluded to many times in the mythologies of various peoples.The Egyptian Demon, Typhon, was symbolized as part crocodile and part hogbecause these animals are gross and earthy in both appearance and temperament.Since the world began, living things have feared the darkness; those fewcreatures who use it as a shield for their maneuvers were usually connected withthe Spirit of Evil. Consequently cats, bats, toads, and owls are associated withwitchcraft. In certain parts of Europe it is still believed that at night blackmagicians assume the bodies of wolves and roam around destroying. From thisnotion originated the stories of the werewolves. Serpents, because they lived inthe earth, were associated with the Spirit of Darkness. As the battle betweenGood and Evil centers around the use of the generative forces of Nature, wingedserpents represent the regeneration of the animal nature of man or those GreatOnes in whom this regeneration is complete. Among the Egyptians the sun’s raysare often shown ending in human hands. Masons will find a connection betweenthese hands and the well-known Paw of the Lion which raises all things to lifewith its grip."},{"pageContent":"SOLAR COLORS The theory so long held of three primary and four secondary colors is purelyexoteric, for since the earliest periods it has been known that there are seven,and not three, primary colors, the human eye being capable of estimating onlythree of them. Thus, although green can be made by combining blue and yellow,there is also a true or primary green which is not a compound. This can beproved by breaking up the spectrum with a prism. Helmholtz found that theso-called secondary colors of the spectrum could not be broken up into theirsupposed primary colors. Thus the orange of the spectrum, if passed through asecond prism, does not break up into red and yellow but remains orange.Consciousness, intelligence, and force are fittingly symbolized by the colorsblue, yellow, and red. The therapeutic effects of the colors, moreover, are inharmony with this concept, for blue is a fine, soothing, electrical color;yellow, a vitalizing and refining color; and red, an agitating and heat-givingcolor. It has also been demonstrated that minerals and plants affect the humanconstitution according to their colors. Thus a yellow flower generally yields amedicine that affects the constitution in a manner similar to yellow light orthe musical tone mi. An orange flower will influence in a manner similar toorange light and, being one of the so-called secondary colors, correspondseither to the tone re or to the chord of do and mi.The ancients conceived the spirit of man to correspond with the color blue, themind with yellow, and the body with red. Heaven is therefore blue, earth yellow,and hell—or the underworld—red. The fiery condition of the inferno merelysymbolizes the nature of the sphere or plane of force of which it is composed.In the Greek Mysteries the irrational sphere was always considered as red, forit represented that condition in which the consciousness is enslaved by thelusts and passions of the lower nature. In India certain of the gods—usuallyattributes of Vishnu—are depicted with blue skin to signify their divine andsupermundane constitution. According to esoteric philosophy, blue is the trueand sacred color of the sun. The apparent orange-yellow shade of this orb is theresult of its rays being immersed in the substances of the illusionary world.In the original symbolism of the Christian Church, colors were of firstimportance and their use was regulated according to carefully prepared rules.Since the Middle Ages, however, the carelessness with which colors have beenemployed has resulted in the loss of their deeper emblematic meanings. In itsprimary aspect, white or silver signified life, purity, innocence, joy, andlight; red, the suffering and death of Christ and His saints, and also divinelove, blood, and warfare or suffering; blue, the heavenly sphere and the statesof godliness and contemplation; yellow or gold, glory, fruitfulness, andgoodness; green, fecundity, youthfulness, and prosperity; violet, humility, deepaffection, and sorrow ; black, death, destruction, and humiliation. In earlychurch art the colors of robes and ornaments also revealed whether a saint hadbeen martyred, as well as the character of the work that he had done to deservecanonization.In addition to the colors of the spectrum there are a vast number of vibratorycolor waves, some too low and others too high to be registered by the humanoptical apparatus. It is appalling to contemplate man’s colossal ignoranceconcerning these vistas of abstract space. As in the past man explored unknowncontinents, so in the future, armed with curious implements fashioned for thepurpose, he will explore these little known fastnesses of light, color, sound,and consciousness."},{"pageContent":"X The Zodiac- and Its Signs It is difficult for this age to estimate correctly the profound effect producedupon the religions, philosophies, and sciences of antiquity by the study of theplanets, luminaries, and constellations. Not without adequate reason were theMagi of Persia called the Star Gazers. The Egyptians were honored with a specialappellation because of their proficiency in computing the power and motion ofthe heavenly bodies and their effect upon the destinies of nations andindividuals.Ruins of primitive astronomical observatories have been discovered in all partsof the world, although in many cases modern archæologists are unaware of thetrue purpose for which these structures were erected. While the telescope wasunknown to ancient astronomers, they made many remarkable calculations withinstruments cut from blocks of granite or pounded from sheets of brass andcopper. In India such instruments are still in use, and they possess a highdegree of accuracy. In Jaipur, Rajputana, India, an observatory consistinglargely of immense stone sundials is still in operation. The famous Chineseobservatory on the wall of Peking consists of immense bronze instruments,including a telescope in the form of a hollow tube without lenses.The pagans looked upon the stars as living things, capable of influencing thedestinies of individuals, nations, and races. That the early Jewish patriarchsbelieved that the celestial bodies participated in the affairs of men is evidentto any student of Biblical literature, as, for example, in the Book of Judges:“They fought from heaven, even the stars in their courses fought againstSisera.” The Chaldeans, Phœnicians, Egyptians, Persians, Hindus, and Chinese allhad zodiacs that were much alike in general character, and different authoritieshave credited each of these nations with being the cradle of astrology andastronomy The Central and North American Indians also had an understanding ofthe zodiac, but the patterns and numbers of the signs differed in many detailsfrom those of the Eastern Hemisphere.019 [images/00020.jpg] GROUP OF WORLD RELIGIONS.At the left of the plate stands Mohammed, holding aloft pages from the Koran,his left foot upon an image which he has overthrown. Behind Mohammed theCelestial Butt—signifying the constellation of Taurus—opens the “Egg of theYear” with his horns. At the lower right is a bas-relief of the Persian Sun God,Mithras, in an attitude signifying the conquest of the sun over the CelestialBull at the ancient vernal equinox. In the center stands the High Priest ofIsrael, his right arm encircling the base of the seven-branched candlestick—theMosaic symbol of the Planetary Governors of the world. To his right is thestatue of the golden calf and to his left the robed figures of the Greek mysticsbearing a tripod in which burns the sacrificial fire. Behind the bull Apis,crowned with the lunar globe, and Father Nile, bearing the horn of plenty andpouring the waters of life from his urn, loom the Pyramids—the great Egyptiantemples of initiation. In the clouds at the left is the seated figure of JupiterAmmon, brandishing a flaming thunderbolt and horned to signify that he partakesof the attributes of the zodiacal ram. In the heavens appears the mystery of theApocalypse. The four creatures of Ezekiel’s Vision surround an altar upon whichis the Book of Seven Seals and the Lamb of God. At the upper left is the band ofthe zodiac. The constellations of Taurus, Aries, and Pisces represent thestellar influences which—according to the ancients—descending upon the earth,are responsible for the establishment of the religious and philosophicalinstitutions herein set forth.020 [images/00021.jpg] HERMES STANDING UPON THE BACK OF TYPHON.Hermes, as the personification of Universal Wisdom, is here depicted with hisfoot upon the back of Typhon, the vanquished dragon of ignorance and perversion.To the Egyptian initiates Typhon, the devourer of souls, signified the lowerworld which swallows up the spiritual nature of the individual who, beingimperfect, is forced to descend from the higher spheres and be reborn into thephysical universe. To be swallowed by Typhon therefore signifies the process ofrebirth, from which man can only release himself by vanquishing his mortalAdversary.In one hand Hermes carries the Caduceus, a winged rod with two fighting serpentsentwined about it; in the other, the immortal Emerald, upon whose surface wasinscribed in raised letters the sum of philosophy. The figure wears the ancientEgyptian Masonic apron according to the pattern discovered by Belzoni, theeminent Egyptologist. The two small circles contain the forms and symbols mostclosely associated with Hermes. In the upper circle is the ibis, whose curiouscharacteristics have caused it to be particularly associated with the medicalart. In the initiation ceremonies the Egyptian priests wore masks in the form ofthe ibis head to signify that they represented the attributes of Thoth, orHermes. The lower circle contains the dog, an animal always associated withHermes because of its intelligence and devotion. Upon the forehead of Hermesappears the uræus, the secret symbol of the constellation of Scorpio, whichrepresents the regeneration of the same power that in the form of a dragon lieshelpless under his foot. The scarab over the heart of Hermes represents thepresence of the spiritual and regenerative light within his own soul; the collartypifies by its circles the orbits of the heavenly bodies. The three points ofthe tail of Typhon which end in arrows indicate the three destructiveexpressions of universal energy—mental, moral, and physical perversion. Theentire diagram signifies mastery through the regeneration of the body, theillumination of the mind, and the transmutation of the emotions.021 [images/00022.jpg] AN IDEALISTIC DEPICTION OF THE ATLANTEAN MYSTERY TEMPLE.In the Critias, Plato describes in detait the divine foundation of the AttanteanEmpire, originally known as Poseidonis. The golden age preserved in myth andlegend, when the gods walked with men, depicts the zenith of Atlanteancivilization. The demigods of the ancient world were the Atlanteans, to whomevery civilized nation owes an incalculable debt of gratitude. In the BritishMuseum there is a remarkable document—known as the Troano manuscript—which waswritten over 3,500 years ago by the Mayas of Yucatan, containing an authenticaccount of the cataclysm which sank the continent of Atlantis. This pricelessdocument contains the following statement according to the translation by LePlongeon: “In the year 6 Kan, on the 11th Mulac in the month Zac, there occurredterrible earthquakes, which continued without interruption until the 13th Chuen.The country of the hills of Mud, the land of Mu, was sacrificed; being twiceupheaved it suddenly disappeared during one night, the basin being continuallyshaken by volcanic forces. Being confined, these caused the land to sink and torise several times and in various places. At last the surface gave away and tencountries were torn asunder and scattered; unable to stand the force of theconvulsions, they sank with their 64,000,000 inhabitants.”Before the Atlantean continent was submerged, the initiates of the AttanteanMysteries, carrying with them the secret doctrines entrusted to their keeping,immigrated into Egypt and other parts of the earth where they would be safe fromthe impending catastrophe. Thus their secret teaching—with its priceless valueto subsequent ages—was preserved. They established centers of learning andpromulgated the code, clothed in the language of symbolism, to such as theydeemed worthy to receive it.022 [images/00023.jpg] 023 [images/00024.jpg] THE BEMBINE TABLE OF ISIS.Concerning the theurgic or magic sense in which the Egyptian priests exhibitedin the Bembine Table of Isis the philosophy of sacrifice, rites, and ceremoniesby a system of occult symbols, Athanasius Kircher writes: “The early priestsbelieved that a great spiritual power was invoked by correct and unabridgedsacrificial ceremonies. If one feature were lacking, the whole was vitiated,says Iamblichus. Hence they were most careful in all details, for theyconsidered it absolutely essential for the entire chain of logical connectionsto be exactly according to ritual. Certainly for no other reason did theyprepare and prescribe for future use the manuals, as it were, for conducting therites. They learned, too, what the first hieromancers—possessed, as it were, bya divine fury—devised as a system of symbolism for exhibiting their mysteries.These they placed in this Tablet of Isis, before the eyes of those admitted tothe sanctum sanctorum in order to teach the natures of the Gods and theprescribed forms of sacrifice. Since each of the orders of Gods had its peculiarsymbols, gestures, costumes, and ornaments, they thought it necessary to observethese in the whole apparatus of worship, as nothing was more efficacious indrawing the benign attention of the deities and genii.*** Thus their temples,remote from the usual haunts of men, contained representations of nearly everyform in nature. First, in the pavement, they symbolized the physical economy ofthe world, using minerals, stones, and other things suitable for ornaments,including little streams of water. The walls showed the starry world, and thedome the world of genii. In the center was the altar, to suggest the emanationsof the Supreme Mind from its center. Thus the entire interior constituted apicture of the Universe of Worlds. The priests in making sacrifices wore raimentadorned with figures similar to those attributed to the Gods. Their bodies werepartially bare like those of the deities, and they themselves were divested ofall material cares and practiced the strictest chastity.*** Their heads wereveiled to indicate their charge of earthly things. Their heads and bodies whereshaved, for they regarded hair as a useless excrescence. Upon the head they borethe same insignia as those attributed to the Gods. Thus arrayed, they regardedthemselves to be transformed into that intelligence with which they continuouslydesired to be identified. For example, in order to call down to the world thesoul and spirit of the Universe, they stood before the image shown in the thronein the center of our Tablet, wearing the same symbols as that figure and itsattendants, and offered sacrifices. By these and the accompanying singing ofhymns they believed that they infallibly drew the God’s attention to theirprayer. And so they did in regard to the other regions of the Tablet, believingthat of necessity the proper ritual properly carried out would evoke the deitydesired. That this was the origin of the science of the oracles is apparent. Asa touched chord produces a harmony of sound, likewise the adjoining chordsrespond though not touched. Similarly the idea they expressed by theirconcurrent acts while adoring the God came into accord with basic Idea and, byan intellectual union, it was returned to them deiformed, and they thus obtainedthe Idea of Ideas. Hence there sprang up in their souls, they thought, the giftof prophecy and divination, and they believed they could foretell future events,impeding evils, etc. For as in the Supreme Mind everything is simultaneous andspaceless, the future is therefore present in that Mind; and they thought thatwhile the human mind was absorbed in the Supreme by contemplation, by that unionthey were enabled to know all the future. Nearly all that is represented in ourTablet consists of amulets which, by the analogy above described, would inspirethem, under the described conditions, with the virtues of the Superior Power andenable them to receive good and avert evil. They also believed they could inthis magical manner effect cures of diseases; that genii could be induced toappear to them during sleep and cure or teach them to cure the sick. In thisbelief they consulted the Gods about all sorts of doubts and difficulties, whileadorned with the simulacra of the mystic rite and intently contemplating theDivine Ideas; and while so enraptured they believed the God by some sign, nod orgesture communicated with them, whether asleep or awake, concerning the truth orfalsity of the matter in point.” (See Œdipus Ægyptiacus.)024 [images/00025.jpg] THE SAITIC ISIS.I am Isis, mistress of the whole land: I was instructed by Hermes, and withHermes I invented the writings of the nations, in order that not all shouldwrite with the same letters. I gave mankind their laws, and ordained what no onecan alter. I am the eldest daughter of Kronos. I am the wife and sister of theking Osiris. I am she who rises in the dog star. I am she who is called thegoddess of women.*** I am she who separated the heaven from the earth. I havepointed out their paths to the stars. I have invented seamanship.*** I havebrought together men and women.*** I have ordained that the elders shall bebeloved by the children. With my brother Osiris I made an end of cannibalism. Ihave instructed mankind in the mysteries. I have taught reverence of the divinestatues. I have established the temple precincts. I have overthrown the dominionof the tyrants. I have caused men to love woman. I have made justice morepowerful than silver and gold. I have caused truth to be considered beautiful.”(See Erman’s Handbook of Egyptian Religion.)The face and form of Isis were covered with a veil of scarlet cloth, symbolic ofignorance and emotionalism which forever stand between man and Truth. Isis liftsher veil and discovers herself to the true and wise investigator whounselfishly, humbly, and earnestly seeks to understand the mysteries whichsurround him in the universe. Those to whom she reveals herself are warned toremain silent concerning the mysteries which they have seen. The greatadmonition of the Wise Men was: “If you know it, be silent.” To the vulgar andprofane, the infidel and disinterested one, she does not uncover her face, forthey could not understand the secret processes of the invisible worlds.025 [images/00026.jpg] CONSULTING THE ORACLE OF DELPHI.While the tripod and its base as here shown differ from the description ofseveral authors, an attempt has been made to follow as closely as possible thesymbolism concealed within the allegory of the oracle. The Delphic Mysteriesused the oracle as their chief symbol, and it is the spiritual esoteric mysteryrather than the historical and consequently unimportant aspect with which thestudent of symbolism is interested.While the spirit inhabiting the fumes which rose continuously from the fissureentered into the body of the priestess, the tripod vibrated as though strucksevere and repeated blows. Loud ctangings were heard, which echoed through thecavern. The din increased as the control of the dæmon over the priestess becamemore complete, and the rattling and crashing did not cease until the spiritreleased its hold upon the Pythia. The three legs of the tripod symbolize thethree periods of time controlled by Apollo, namely, the past, the present, andthe future. The space enclosed by the legs of the tripod forms the sacredPythagorean tetrahedron with the prophetess seated upon its apex. As thepriestess of Delphi is held aloft over the abyss of the oracle, supported onlyby three slender legs ending in claws, so the spiritual nature of man issuspended over the abyss of oblivion by three golden threads of Divine power.The face of Apollo appears upon the tripod, and around the base are coiledserpents to symbolize Python, whose decaying body lies beneath the Delphicshrine.026 [images/00027.jpg] PYTHAGORAS OF CROTONA. Though Pythagoras excelled Plato in the profundity of his philosophicdeductions, the transcendental element in his doctrines has provoked theridicule of a materialistic modern science. All too lightly the world has passedover the achievements of the first “philosopher” to whom it is indebted for somany of the basic theorems of mathematics, music, and astronomy. The twentiethcentury student of Greek philosophy has been taught to associate the name ofPythagoras with such puerile issues as his golden shin bone and his ban upon theeating of beans! It has also been held against Pythagoras that he delivered hisdiscourses from behind a curtain, preached in allegories and enigmas, andrevealed his scientific knowledge only to such initiated disciples as had spentmany years in self-discipline. His sciolistic critics, however, have failed toconsider the manner in which Pythagoras obtained his immense wealth of abstractlearning. The Mysteries of Greece, Egypt, Persia, and India without exceptionbound their initiates to inviolable secrecy. Having accepted the obligations ofthese societies, Pythagoras had no honorable course other than to abide by theirregulations. Iamblichus lists 218 men and 17 women among the most famous of thePythagorean philosophers. It is thus evident that Pythagoras revealed hissecrets to a considerable number of persons—probably all who he felt couldunderstand and be benefited by his knowledge. The Pythagorean doctrine ofmathematical philosophy may yet be accepted as the one system of thought able tocope with the riddle of existence.027 [images/00028.jpg] THE ANCIENT OF THE ANCIENTS.In the Greater Holy Assembly it is written of the Ancient of the Ancients thatHe is the Concealed of the Concealed Ones, the Eternal of the Eternal Ones, theMystery of the Mysteries, and that in His symbols He is knowable and unknowable.In the Zohar His robes are said to be white, but they are here shown as red tosignify that the garments of Divinity partake of the nature of cosmic activity.His face is declared to be the likeness of a face vast, luminous, and terrible.He sits upon a throne of flaming light and the flashes of the fire are subjectto His will. The white light streaming from His head illumines four hundredthousand worlds. (Some texts read forty thousand superior worlds.) The glory ofthis light shall be given unto the just, who are called “the sacred fruits ofthe Tree of the Sephiroth.”Thirteen thousand myriads of worlds come into tight from His skull, from whichissues forth a mysterious dew having the power to awaken the spiritually deadinto everlasting life. The length of “The Great Face” is declared to be threehundred and seventy thousand myriads of worlds; therefore it is called “The LongFace.” The appearance of the Ancient of the Ancients is that of the Aged of theAged, who has been before the beginning and whose throne stands upon thefirmament. By the Aged of the Aged is willed “The Short Face,” or creation,which is the chariot of the Most Holy of the Most Holy.The hair and beard of the Ancient of the Ancients extend to the uttermost partsof the universe. From His skull hang down a thousand thousand myriads, seventhousand and five hundred curling hairs which are not mingled lest confusionexist; and in each curl are four hundred and ten locks of hair, and these hairsall and singular radiate into four hundred and ten worlds. In the hollow of Hisskull is the aerial membrane of the supreme hidden Wisdom and His brain extendsand goes forth by thirty-two paths. From the beard of the Ancient of theAncients flow thirteen fountains and from His hands pour the Mother and FatherRays, by which existence comes into being. The head of the Ancient of theAncients is cleft like that of Zeus to permit wisdom in the form of Athena toemerge therefrom.028 [images/00029.jpg] A LAYOUT OF MAJOR TAROT TRUMPS.The Tarot consists of a deck of 78 curiously emblazoned cards of uncertainorigin and date. The deck is divided into two general sections, of which thelarger contains 56 cards—termed the minor trumps—and the smaller, 22cards—termed the major trumps. The minor trumps are further divided into foursuits—each containing 14 cards—somewhat similar to those of modern playingcards. The four suits are called Rods (Clubs), Swords (Spades), Cups (Hearts),and Coins (Diamonds). The pip cards of each suit ascend from the ace to the 10,and their denominations are shown by groups of their respective emblems, as 6Rods, 4 Cups, 9 Coins, or 3 Swords. The court cards of each suit are four innumber, termed King, Queen, Knight, and Page. The Kings and Queens are usuallydepicted seated, the Knights on horseback, and the Pages standing. Each holdsthe emblem of its suit. The major trumps are also divided into two sections, oneof which is composed of 21 cards, usually numbered, and the other of a singlecard, either unnumbered or marked with a cipher. The accepted order of the 21cards with their names is as follows. (1) the Juggler; (2) the High Priestess,or Female Pope; (3) the Empress; (4) the Emperor; (5) the Pope; (6) the Lovers,or Marriage; (7) the Chariot; (8) Justice; (9) the Hermit; (10) the Wheel ofFortune; (11) Strength; (12) the Hanged Man; (13) Death; (14) Temperance; (15)the Devil; (16) the Fire from Heaven; (17) the Stars; (18) the Moon; (19) theSun; (20) the Judgment; and (21) the World. The unnumbered card upon which theothers are spread is designated the Fool.029 [images/00030.jpg] THE COURTYARD OF THE TABERNACLE.While the religion of the early Israelites has been adversely criticized, itsdisparagers have failed to give consideration to the time and environment ofwhich it was a natural and consistent product. It is impossible to judge onecivilization by comparing it with another widely separated from it in point oftime. The modern world looks upon many ancient practices as cruel and barbarous,but is guilty every day of offenses which would have proved equally revolting tothe sensibilities of ancient peoples! At no time has the world been composed ofa majority of thinking people. Only here and there is found an intellectactually seeking to solve not only the problems of its own destiny but alsothose of others. The esoteric, spiritual side of every religion is a beautiful,humanitarian, and transcendent code, to be understood only by those who haveraised themselves above the plane of the prosaic and the conventional. For agesman has served the “letter of the law,” not realizing that “the letter killeth,but the spirit giveth life.”To the true scholar and mystic, the Old Testament is an endless source ofinspiration. To the intellectualist. it is a cause of ceaseless wrangling, andhe argues over dates and places, overlooking entirely the sublime truthsconcealed under the crude allegories of Scripture. He who understands thoroughlythe Mystery of the Tabernacle needs no other religion, for he will be at onewith the seers of all ages. As he goes about his daily life, every man—unknownto himself—is a priest of the Tabernacle; for as priests were appointed byJehovah to keep His house in order, so each individual is, in a like manner,appointed to keep his own little world in order. Nature is the Tabernacle, manis the priest, and the one God of all nations and all peoples dwells in everyhuman soul behind the embroidered veil of the “Holy of Holies.”030 [images/00031.jpg] 031 [images/00032.jpg] GRAND ROSICRUCIAN ALCHEMICAL FORMULA.In the heavens and surrounded by both an outer and an inner aureole and byhierarchies of celestial beings are the radiant symbols of the Holy Trinity:032[images/00033.jpg](the Father?), the Lamb (the Son), and the Dove (the HolyGhost). The respective dignities of the heavenly host are determined by thenumber and arrangement of their wings. The glory of the Godhead and theinvisible world is concealed from the inferior creation partly by a line andpartly by the circle of the starry heavens, itself obscured by clouds. Fivebirds—a crow (Saturn, lead); a swan (Jupiter, tin); a cock (Mars, iron); apelican (Venus, copper); and the phœnix (Mercury, quicksilver)—occupy the halfcircle directly within the band of the starry heavens. The upper half of theblue circle containing the five planetary signs is occupied by the zodiacalsigns. In the green circle appear the words: “The solar year, the stellar year,and the year of winds”; in the yellow circle, “The mercury of the sages,corporeal mercury, and common, or visible, mercury”; in the orange circle,“Combustible sulphur, fixed sulphur, and volatile, or ethereal, sulphur”; in thered circle, “Elementary salt, earthly salt. and central salt”; and in the violetcircle, “Four kinds of fire are requisite for the work.” The white centraltriangle contains the figure of the solar mercury.The entire upper section of the plate is an esoteric diagram of the constitutionof the threefold spiritual sun. In the lower foreground is a hill upon whichgrow a number of trees, each bearing the symbol of an alchemical substance. (Fordetails consult Basil Valentine’s table of alchemical symbols in chapter XXXV.)At the lower right and represented by a nocturnal scene is the inferior world,while at the lower left and represented by a diurnal scene is the superiorworld. Thus water is symbolized by the right side of the plate and fire by theleft side. Under the wings of the phœnix are two circles containing the symbolsof fire and air; under the wings of the eagle are two other circles containingthe symbols of earth and water. The human figures, one male and the otherfemale, both attached to the superior wold by a golden chain and bearing upontheir bodies the symbols of the creative forces, stand for the divine (male) andhuman (female) principles in every creature. The spirit and will are representedby a lion rampant; the soul and intuition by a deer with twelve lights or starsupon its horns and bearing a trifoliate leaf symbolic of the threefold divisionof all natural things.In the center of the picture is the figure of philosophic equilibrium and theaccomplishment of the magnum opus. The double-bodied lion emphasizes to theinitiated the necessity for the final union of all diversified parts; also thatlight and darkness (symbols of all natural opposites) are two bodies with asingle head. Upon this strange creature which he has fabricated by his art andwhich symbolizes the reconciliation of apparently irreconcilable elements,stands the alchemistic philosopher. The stars upon his robe reveal the luminousnature of the purified and regenerated adept, and with the maces (the illuminedintellect) he destroys the illusion of light and darkness and, uniting thevarious scattered parts of cosmos, fashions therefrom the philosophic androgyne.In the Hermetic Museum this plate is accompanied by the following quotation: “Bythe word of the Lord were the heavens established, and their hosts by the breathof His mouth. The Spirit of the Lord hath filled the wold. All things aresatisfied with Thy goodness, 0 Lord. Thou turnest away Thy face, they aretroubled. Thou turnest away Thy Spirit, they die and return again to their dust.Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit and they are created, and renewest the face of theearth. Thy glory is for everlasting.” In the Hermetic Museum a free rendering ofthe Emerald Table of Hermes (q.v.) is also annexed to this plate.Only by profound contemplation and familiarity with the principles of mediævalalchemy may the true spirit of chemical mysticism be discovered. In the aboveplate is set forth the complete key to the regeneration of the metals, thetransmutation of earthliness into celestial splendor, and the mystery ofgeneration which has been so sadly and ignorantly misinterpreted by thesciolists of the twentieth century.033 [images/00034.jpg] PARSIFAL AND THE HOLY GRAIL.In the great temple on Mount Salvat stands Parsifal, the third and last king ofthe Holy Grail, holding aloft the scintillating green Grail Cup and the sacredspear. From the tip of the spear trickles an endless stream of blood. BeforeParsifal kneels Kundry (Kundalini), the temptress, who, released from the spellof the evil Klingsor, adores the sacred relics of the Passion. Of the GrailMysteries, Hargrave Jennings writes: “The council of the Knights or Brothers ofthe Holy Grail, or Graël, was a reflex of the sacred bond sanctified bysacraments which held the majestic and mystic Rosicrucians together. These werereally the guardians of the greater mysteries. In this sense of the mysteriousand the sacred, the ‘garter’ of the ’Most noble the Order of the Garter—thefirst of chivalry—is not a ‘garter’ at all, but the ‘-Garder,’ or ‘Keeper,’ thesacredest and holiest guardian of the the supernatural chastity of none otherthan the most exalted feminine personality (of course in the abstract andmiraculous sense), the very foundation of Christianity—the ‘Cestus’ or girdle ofthe blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, the Queen of Heaven, with her victoriousfoot, for all the ages past and to come, trampling upon the Dragon, in hercelestial purity, as the‘Mother of Christ.’” (See Phallicism.) The key to theGrail Mysteries will be apparent if in the sacred spear is recognized the pinealgland with its peculiar pointlike projection and in the Holy Grail the pituitarybody containing the mysterious Water of Life. Mount Salvat is the human body;the domed temple upon its summit, the brain; and the castle of Klingsor in thedark valley below, the animal nature which lures the knights (brain energies)into the garden of illusion and perversion. Parsifal, as the purified candidate,becomes the Master of the holy relics and of the sacred science for which theystand; Kundry, having fulfilled the purpose of her existence, dies at the footof the altar with the immortal words: “I serve!”034 [images/00035.jpg] A ROSICRUCIAN CRUCIFIXION.The solar crucifixion is an outstanding example of the astronomical knowledgepossessed by the so-called prehistoric world. “In Herschel’s ground-plan of theuniverse in human form,” writes Albert Ross Parsons, “our solar system islocated at the heart of the Divine Man of the skies. Hence, the catastrophe inour solar system, by which the ecliptic was sundered from the celestial equator,was a rupture or piercing of the heart of the Divine Man. The ecliptic andequator no longer coinciding, they formed a cross upon which the Divine Man wastransfixed in space. This idea was familiar to the Hindus and to Plato. Hencearose the prehistoric Christianity, the religion of the lamb slain from thefoundation of the world, of the Book of Revelation.” (See New Light from theGreat Pyramid.)Ignoring the story of the crucifixion in its literal sense, the Gnosticsconsidered only its cosmic import. In Rosicrucian mysticism, the Christ Spiritis said to have established a direct link with the earth through the blood whichpoured from the wounds in the hands, feet, and side of Jesus. Being the ancientsymbol of the secret doctrine, the cross represents to the initiated that divineinstitution which, releasing the heavenly man from his animal part, launches thespiritual nature into the sphere of Reality. Therefore the cross may be said tobe the emblem of philosophic death, anc the Mysteries cannot achieve their enduntil they have caused each of their neophytes to pass victoriously through thecycle of suffering, death and resurrection. The entire procedure is concealed inthe symbolism of the grape. As one author has perceived, the agony in the Gardenof Gethsemane is analogous to the crushing of the grapes in the wine press. Hewho comprehends the mystery of the sacramental cup possesses the key to humanregeneration. Man, crucified, passes through death upon the symbol of life andattains to life upon the symbol of death. The break between the Self and thenot-self is thus complete and the spirit, emerging from its chrysalis, leavesthe empty shell behind as the token of its attainment. The agony of the Savior,consequently, is not the agony of death but the agony of birth. Only to him whohas fourd his life by losing it is the mystery comprehensible.035 [images/00036.jpg] THE KEY TO DANTE’S DIVINE COMEDY.In his article on The Topography of Dante’s Spiritual World, Charles AllenDinsmore writes: “He [Dante] maintained the earth is round, having a hemisphereof land, in the centre of which stands Jerusalem. The other hemisphereoriginally contained land; but when Lucifer, hurled from Heaven, was about tofall upon it, the soil ‘veiled itself with the sea’ and came to the other sideof the globe, making a hemisphere of land and a hemisphere of water. Theinterior of the earth also retreated before the descending Lucifer, leaving avast conical-shaped cavity, which extended from the centre of the globe to thesurface of the inhabited hemisphere. The void which evil made in the world isthe abode of lost souls, and is divided into nine circles, of which the seventhis subdivided into three smaller circles, the eighth into ten ditches, and theninth into four belts. At the centre of the earth, and thus at the pointfarthest from God, is Lucifer, with his head and body in one hemisphere, and hislegs in the other, so that when Virgil and Dante turned upon his haunch, theypassed the centre of gravity and emerged from one hemisphere into the other.”In the midst of the hemisphere of water stands a conical mountain, Purgatory,rising in seven steps. On its summit is the terrestrial Paradise or Garden ofEden where Dante met Beatrice. According to The Divine Comedy, as the soulclimbs the seven steps of Purgatory it is cleansed of the seven mortal sins, andit then ascends through the seven spheres of the Ptolemaic universe. To each ofthe planets is assigned one of the seven virtues. In the eighth sphere the soulreceives a knowledge of spiritual truths and in the ninth, or highest, it isabsorbed into the celestial mysteries.The word zodiac is derived from the Greek ζωδακóς (zodiakos), which means “acircle of animals,” or, as some believe, “little animals.” It is the name givenby the old pagan astronomers to a band of fixed stars about sixteen degreeswide, apparently encircling the earth. Robert Hewitt Brown, 32°, states that theGreek word zodiakos comes from zo-on, meaning “an animal.” He adds: “This latterword is compounded directly from the primitive Egyptian radicals, zo, life, andon, a being.”036 [images/00037.jpg] THE EQUINOXES AND SOLSTICES.The plane of the zodiac intersects the celestial equator at an angle ofapproximately 23’ 28’. The two points of intersection (A and B) are called theequinoxes.The Greeks, and later other peoples influenced by their culture, divided theband of the zodiac into twelve sections, each being sixteen degrees in width andthirty degrees in length. These divisions were called the Houses of the Zodiac.The sun during its annual pilgrimage passed through each of these in turn.Imaginary creatures were traced in the star groups bounded by these rectangles;and because most of them were animal—or part animal—in form, they later becameknown as the Constellations, or Signs, of the Zodiac.There is a popular theory concerning the origin of the zodiacal creatures to theeffect that they were products of the imagination of shepherds, who, watchingtheir flocks at night, occupied their minds by tracing the forms of animals andbirds in the heavens. This theory is untenable, unless the “shepherds” beregarded as the shepherd priests of antiquity. It is unlikely that the zodiacalsigns were derived from the star groups which they now represent. It is far moreprobable that the creatures assigned to the twelve houses are symbolic of thequalities and intensity of the sun’s power while it occupies different parts ofthe zodiacal belt.On this subject Richard Payne Knight writes: “The emblematical meaning, whichcertain animals were employed to signify, was only some particular propertygeneralized; and, therefore, might easily be invented or discovered by thenatural operation of the mind: but the collections of stars, named after certainanimals, have no resemblance whatever to those animals; which are thereforemerely signs of convention adopted to distinguish certain portions of theheavens, which were probably consecrated to those particular personifiedattributes, which they respectively represented.” (The Symbolical Language ofAncient Art and Mythology.)Some authorities are of the opinion that the zodiac was originally divided intoten (instead of twelve) houses, or “solar mansions.” In early times there weretwo separate standards—one solar and the other lunar—used for the measurement ofthe months, years, and seasons. The solar year was composed of ten months ofthirty-six days each, and five days sacred to the gods. The lunar year consistedof thirteen months of twenty-eight days each, with one day left over. The solarzodiac at that time consisted of ten houses of thirty-six degrees each.The first six signs of the zodiac of twelve signs were regarded as benevolent,because the sun occupied them while traversing the Northern Hemisphere. The6,000 years during which, according to the Persians, Ahura-Mazda ruled Hisuniverse in harmony and peace, were symbolic of these six signs. The second sixwere considered malevolent, because while the sun was traveling the SouthernHemisphere it was winter with the Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians. Thereforethese six months were symbolic of the 6,000 years of misery and suffering causedby the evil genius of the Persians, Ahriman, who sought to overthrow the powerof Ahura-Mazda.Those who hold the opinion that before its revision by the Greeks the zodiacconsisted of only ten signs adduce evidence to show that Libra (the Scales) wasinserted into the zodiac by dividing the constellation of Virgo-Scorpio (at thattime one sign) into two parts, thus establishing “the balance” at the point ofequilibrium between the ascending northern and the descending southern signs.(See The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries, by Hargrave Jennings.) On thissubject Isaac Myer states: “We think that the Zodiacal constellations were firstten and represented an immense androgenic man or deity; subsequently this waschanged, resulting in Scorpio and Virgo and making eleven; after this fromScorpio, Libra, the Balance, was taken, making the present twelve.” (TheQabbalah.)Each year the sun passes entirely around the zodiac and returns to the pointfrom which it started—the vernal equinox—and each year it falls just a littleshort of making the complete circle of the heavens in the allotted period oftime. As a result, it crosses the equator just a little behind the spot in thezodiacal sign where it crossed the previous year. Each sign of the zodiacconsists of thirty degrees, and as the sun loses about one degree everyseventy-two years, it regresses through one entire constellation (or sign) inapproximately 2,160 years, and through the entire zodiac in about 25,920 years.(Authorities disagree concerning these figures.) This retrograde motion iscalled the precession of the equinoxes. This means that in the course of about25,920 years, which constitute one Great Solar or Platonic Year, each one of thetwelve constellations occupies a position at the vernal equinox for nearly 2,160years, then gives place to the previous sign.Among the ancients the sun was always symbolized by the figure and nature of theconstellation through which it passed at the vernal equinox. For nearly the past2,000 years the sun has crossed the equator at the vernal equinox in theconstellation of Pisces (the Two Fishes). For the 2,160 years before that itcrossed through the constellation of Aries (the Ram). Prior to that the vernalequinox was in the sign of Taurus (the Bull). It is probable that the form ofthe bull and the bull’s proclivities were assigned to this constellation becausethe bull was used by the ancients to plow the fields, and the season set asidefor plowing and furrowing corresponded to the time at which the sun reached thesegment of the heavens named Taurus.Albert Pike describes the reverence which the Persians felt for this sign andthe method of astrological symbolism in vogue among them, thus: “In Zoroaster’scave of initiation, the Sun and Planets were represented, overhead, in gems andgold, as was also the Zodiac. The Sun appeared, emerging from the back ofTaurus.” In the constellation of the Bull are also to be found the “SevenSisters”—the sacred Pleiades—famous to Freemasonry as the Seven Stars at theupper end of the Sacred Ladder.In ancient Egypt it was during this period—when the vernal equinox was in thesign of Taurus—that the Bull, Apis, was sacred to the Sun God, who was worshipedthrough the animal equivalent of the celestial sign which he had impregnatedwith his presence at the time of its crossing into the Northern Hemisphere. Thisis the meaning of an ancient saying that the celestial Bull “broke the egg ofthe year with his horns.”Sampson Arnold Mackey, in his Mythological Astronomy of the AncientsDemonstrated, makes note of two very interesting points concerning the bull inEgyptian symbolism. Mr. Mackey is of the opinion that the motion of the earththat we know as the alternation of the poles has resulted in a great change ofrelative position of the equator and the zodiacal band. He believes thatoriginally the band of the zodiac was at right angles to the equator, with thesign of Cancer opposite the north pole and the sign of Capricorn opposite thesouth pole. It is possible that the Orphic symbol of the serpent twisted aroundthe egg attempts to show the motion of the sun in relation to the earth undersuch conditions. Mr. Mackey advances the Labyrinth of Crete, the name Abraxas,and the magic formula, abracadabra, among other things, to substantiate histheory. Concerning abracadabra he states:“But the slow progressive disappearance of the Bull is most happily commemoratedin the vanishing series of letters so emphatically expressive of the greatastronomical fact. For ABRACADABRA is The Bull, the only Bull. The ancientsentence split into its component parts stands thus: Ab‘r-achad-ab’ra, i. e.,Ab‘r, the Bull; achad, the only, &:c.—Achad is one of the names of the Sun,given him in consequence of his Shining ALONE,—he is the ONLY Star to be seenwhen he is seen—the remaining ab’ra, makes the whole to be, The Bull, the onlyBull; while the repetition of the name omitting a letter, till all is gone, isthe most simple, yet the most satisfactory method that could have been devisedto preserve the memory of the fact; and the name of Sorapis, or Serapis, givento the Bull at the above ceremony puts it beyond all doubt.* * * This word(Abracadabra) disappears in eleven decreasing stages; as in the figure. And whatis very remarkable, a body with three heads is folded up by a Serpent witheleven Coils, and placed by Sorapis: and the eleven Volves of the Serpent form atriangle similar to that formed by the ELEVEN diminishing lines of theabracadabra.”Nearly every religion of the world shows traces of astrological influence. TheOld Testament of the Jews, its writings overshadowed by Egyptian culture, is amass of astrological and astronomical allegories. Nearly all the mythology ofGreece and Rome may be traced in star groups. Some writers are of the opinionthat the original twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were derived fromgroups of stars, and that the starry handwriting on the wall of the heavensreferred to words spelt out, with fixed stars for consonants, and the planets,or luminaries, for vowels. These, coming into ever-different combinations, speltwords which, when properly read, foretold future events.As the zodiacal band marks the pathway of the sun through the constellations, itresults in the phenomena of the seasons. The ancient systems of measuring theyear were based upon the equinoxes and the solstices. The year always began withthe vernal equinox, celebrated March 21 with rejoicing to mark the moment whenthe sun crossed the equator northward up the zodiacal arc. The summer solsticewas celebrated when the sun reached its most northerly position, and the dayappointed was June 21. After that time the sun began to descend toward theequator, which it recrossed southbound at the autumnal equinox, September 21.The sun reached its most southerly position at the winter solstice, December 21.Four of the signs of the zodiac have been permanently dedicated to the equinoxesand the solstices; and, while the signs no longer correspond with the ancientconstellations to which they were assigned, and from which they secured theirnames, they are accepted by modern astronomers as a basis of calculation. Thevernal equinox is therefore said to occur in the constellation of Aries (theRam). It is fitting that of all beasts a Ram should be placed at the head of theheavenly flock forming the zodiacal band. Centuries before the Christian Era,the pagans revered this constellation. Godfrey Higgins states: “Thisconstellation was called the ‘Lamb of God.’ He was also called the ‘Savior,’ andwas said to save mankind from their sins. He was always honored with theappellation of , Dominus’ or ‘Lord.’ He was called the ‘Lamb of God which takethaway the sins of the world.’ The devotees addressing him in their litany,constantly repeated the words,‘O Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of theworld, have mercy upon us. Grant us Thy peace.”’ Therefore, the Lamb of God is atitle given to the sun, who is said to be reborn every year in the NorthernHemisphere in the sign of the Ram, although, due to the existing discrepancybetween the signs of the zodiac and the actual star groups, it actually rises inthe sign of Pisces.The summer solstice is regarded as occurring in Cancer (the Crab), which theEgyptians called the scarab—a beetle of the family Lamellicornes, the head ofthe insect kingdom, and sacred to the Egyptians as the symbol of Eternal Life.It is evident that the constellation of the Crab is represented by this peculiarcreature because the sun, after passing through this house, proceeds to walkbackwards, or descend the zodiacal arc. Cancer is the symbol of generation, forit is the house of the Moon, the great Mother of all things and the patroness ofthe life forces of Nature. Diana, the moon goddess of the Greeks, is called theMother of the World. Concerning the worship of the feminine or maternalprinciple, Richard Payne Knight writes:“By attracting or heaving the waters of the ocean, she naturally appeared to bethe sovereign of humidity; and by seeming to operate so powerfully upon theconstitutions of women, she equally appeared to be the patroness and regula-tress of nutrition and passive generation: whence she is said to have receivedher nymphs, or subordinate personifications, from the ocean; and is oftenrepresented by the symbol of the sea crab, an animal that has the property ofspontaneously detaching from its own body any limb that has been hurt ormutilated, and reproducing another in its place.” (The Symbolical Language ofAncient Art and Mythology. ) This water sign, being symbolic of the maternalprinciple of Nature, and recognized by the pagans as the origin of all life, wasa natural and consistent domicile of the moon.The autumnal equinox apparently occurs in the constellation of Libra (theBalances). The scales tipped and the solar globe began in pilgrimage toward thehome of winter. The constellation of the Scales was placed in the zodiac tosymbolize the power of choice, by means of which man may weigh one problemagainst another. Millions of years ago, when the human race was in the making,man was like the angels, who knew neither good nor evil. He fell into the stateof the knowledge of good and evil when the gods gave him the seed for the mentalnature. From man’s mental reactions to his environments he distills the productof experience, which then aids him to regain his lost position plus anindividualized intelligence. Paracelsus said: “The body comes from the elements,the soul from the stars, and the spirit from God. All that the intellect canconceive of comes from the stars [the spirits of the stars, rather than thematerial constellations].”The constellation of Capricorn, in which the winter solstice theoretically takesplace, was called The House of Death, for in winter all life in the NorthernHemisphere is at its lowest ebb. Capricorn is a composite creature, with thehead and upper body of a goat and the tail of a fish. In this constellation thesun is least powerful in the Northern Hemisphere, and after passing through thisconstellation it immediately begins to increase. Hence the Greeks said thatJupiter (a name of the Sun God) was suckled by a goat. A new and differentsidelight on zodiacal symbolism is supplied by John Cole, in A Treatise on theCircular Zodiac of Tentyra, in Egypt: “The symbol therefore of the Goat risingfrom the body of a fish [Capricorn], represents with the greatest propriety themountainous buildings of Babylon rising out of its low and marshy situation; thetwo horns of the Goat being emblematical of the two towns, Nineveh and Babylon,the former built on the Tigris, the latter on the Euphrates; but both subjectedto one sovereignty.”The period of 2,160 years required for the regression of the sun through one ofthe zodiacal constellations is often termed an age. According to this system,the age secured its name from the sign through which the sun passes year afteryear as it crosses the equator at the vernal equinox. From this arrangement arederived the terms The Taurian Age, The Aryan Age, The Piscean Age, and TheAquarian Age. During these periods, or ages, religious worship takes the form ofthe appropriate celestial sign—that which the sun is said to assume as apersonality in the same manner that a spirit assumes a body. These twelve signsare the jewels of his breastplate and his light shines forth from them, oneafter the other.From a consideration of this system, it is readily understood why certainreligious symbols were adopted during different ages of the earth’s history; forduring the 2,160 years the sun was in the constellation of Taurus, it is saidthat the Solar Deity assumed the body of Apis, and the Bull became sacred toOsiris. (For details concerning the astrological ages as related to Biblicalsymbolism, see The Message of the Stars by Max and Augusta Foss Heindel.) Duringthe Aryan Age the Lamb was held sacred and the priests were called shepherds.Sheep and goats were sacrificed upon the altars, and a scapegoat was appointedto bear the sins of Israel.During the Age of Pisces, the Fish was the symbol of divinity and the Sun Godfed the multitude with two small fishes. The frontispiece of Inman’s AncientFaiths shows the goddess Isis with a fish on her head; and the Indian SaviorGod, Christna, in one of his incarnations was cast from the mouth of a fish.Not only is Jesus often referred to as the Fisher of Men, but as John P. Lundywrites: “The word Fish is an abbreviation of this whole title, Jesus Christ, Sonof God, Savior, and Cross; or as St. Augustine expresses it, ‘If you jointogether the initial letters of the five Greek words, ’Iησoς Xρστoς 8eou Υòς∑ωτρ, which mean Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour, they will make IXθΥΣ, Fish,in which word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live inthe abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters, that is, without sin.’”(Monumental Christianity.) Many Christians observe Friday, which is sacred tothe Virgin (Venus), upon which day they shall eat fish and not meat. The sign ofthe fish was one of the earliest symbols of Christianity; and when drawn uponthe sand, it informed one Christian that another of the same faith was near.Aquarius is called the Sign of the Water Bearer, or the man with a jug of wateron his shoulder mentioned in the New Testament. This is sometimes shown as anangelic figure, supposedly androgynous, either pouring water from an urn orcarrying the vessel upon its shoulder. Among Oriental peoples, a water vesselalone is often used. Edward Upham, in his History and Doctrine of Budhism,describes Aquarius as being “in the shape of a pot and of a color between blueand yellow; this Sign is the single house of Saturn.” When Her- schel discoveredthe planet Uranus (sometimes called by the name of its discoverer), the secondhalf of the sign of Aquarius was allotted to this added member of the planetaryfamily. The water pouring from the urn of Aquarius under the name of “the watersof eternal life” appears many times in symbolism. So it is with all the signs.Thus the sun in its path controls whatever form of worship man offers to theSupreme Deity.There are two distinct systems of astrological philosophy. One of them, thePtolemaic, is geocentric: the earth is considered the center of the solarsystem, around which the sun, moon, and planets revolve. Astronomically, thegeocentric system is incorrect; but for thousands of years it had proved itsaccuracy when applied to the material nature of earthly things. A carefulconsideration of the writings of the great occultists and a study of theirdiagrams reveal the fact that many of them were acquainted with another methodof arranging the heavenly bodies.The other system of astrological philosophy is called the heliocentric. Thisposits the sun in the center of the solar system, where it naturally belongs,with the planets and their moons revolving about it. The great difficulty,however, with the heliocentric system is that, being comparatively new, therehas not been sufficient time to experiment successfully and catalogue theeffects of its various aspects and relationships. Geocentric astrology, as itsname implies, is confined to the earthy side of nature, while heliocentricastrology may be used to analyze the higher intellectual and spiritual facultiesof man.The important point to be remembered is that when the sun was said to be in acertain sign of the zodiac, the ancients really meant that the sun occupied theopposite sign and cast its long ray into the house in which they enthroned it.Therefore, when it is said that the sun is in Taurus, it means (astronomically)that the sun is in the sign opposite to Taurus, which is Scorpio. This resultedin two distinct schools of philosophy: one geocentric and exoteric, the otherheliocentric and esoteric. While the ignorant multitudes worshiped the house ofthe sun’s reflection, which in the case described would be the Bull, the wiserevered the house of the sun’s actual dwelling, which would be the Scorpion, orthe Serpent, the symbol of the concealed spiritual mystery. This sign has threedifferent symbols. The most common is that of a Scorpion, who was called by theancients the backbiter, being the symbol of deceit and perversion; the second(and less common) form of the sign is a Serpent, often used by the ancients tosymbolize wisdom.Probably the rarest form of Scorpio is that of an Eagle. The arrangement of thestars of the constellation bears as much resemblance to a flying bird as to ascorpion. Scorpio, being the sign of occult initiation, the flying eagle—theking of birds—represents the highest and most spiritual type of Scorpio, inwhich it transcends the venomous insect of the earth. As Scorpio and Taurus areopposite each other in the zodiac, their symbolism is often closelyintermingled. The Hon. E. M. Plunket, in Ancient Calendars and Constellations,says: “The Scorpion (the constellation Scorpio of the Zodiac opposed to Taurus)joins with Mithras in his attack upon the Bull, and always the genii of thespring and autumn equinoxes are present in joyous and mournful attitudes.”The Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians, who knew the sun as a Bull,called the zodiac a series of furrows, through which the great celestial Oxdragged the plow of the sun. Hence the populace offered up sacrifice and ledthrough the streets magnificent steers, bedecked with flowers and surroundedwith priests, dancing girls of the temple, and musicians. The philosophic electdid not participate in these idolatrous ceremonials, but advocated them as mostsuitable for the types of mind composing the mass of the population. These fewpossessed a far deeper understanding, as the Serpent of Scorpio upon theirforeheads—the Urœus—bore witness.The sun is often symbolized with its rays in the form of a shaggy mane.Concerning the Masonic significance of Leo, Robert Hewitt Brown, 32°, haswritten: “On the 21 st of June, when the sun arrives at the summer solstice, theconstellation Leo—being but 30° in advance of the sun—appears to be leading theway, and to aid by his powerful paw in lifting the sun up to the summit of thezodiacal arch. * * * This visible connection between the constellation Leo andthe return of the sun to his place of power and glory, at the summit of theRoyal Arch of heaven, was the principal reason why that constellation was heldin such high esteem and reverence by the ancients. The astrologers distinguishedLeo as the ‘sole house of the sun,’ and taught that the world was created whenthe sun was in that sign.‘The lion was adored in the East and the West by theEgyptians and the Mexicans. The chief Druid of Britain was styled a lion.”’(Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.) When the Aquarian Age is thoroughlyestablished, the sun will be in Leo, as will be noted from the explanationpreviously given in this chapter regarding the distinction between geocentricand heliocen- tic astrology. Then, indeed, will the secret religions of theworld include once more the raising to initiation by the Grip of the Lion’s Paw.(Lazarus will come forth.)The antiquity of the zodiac is much in dispute. To contend that it originatedbut a mere few thousand years before the Christian Era is a colossal mistake onthe part of those who have sought to compile data concerning its origin. Thezodiac necessarily must be ancient enough to go backward to that period when itssigns and symbols coincided exactly with the positions of the constellationswhose various creatures in their natural functions exemplified the outstandingfeatures of the sun’s activity during each of the twelve months. One author,after many years of deep study on the subject, believed man’s concept of thezodiac to be at least five million years old. In all probability it is one ofthe many things for which the modern world is indebted to the Atlantean or theLemurian civilizations. About ten thousand years before the Christian Era therewas a period of many ages when knowledge of every kind was suppressed, tabletsdestroyed, monuments torn down, and every vestige of available materialconcerning previous civilizations completely obliterated. Only a few copperknives, some arrowheads, and crude carvings on the walls of caves bear mutewitness of those civilizations which preceded this age of destruction. Here andthere a few gigantic structures have remained which, like the strange monolithson Easter Island, are evidence of lost arts and sciences and lost races. Thehuman race is exceedingly old. Modern science counts its age in tens ofthousands of years; occultism, in tens of millions. There is an old saying that“Mother Earth has shaken many civilizations from her back,” and it is not beyondreason that the principles of astrology and astronomy were evolved millions ofyears before the first white man appeared.037 [images/00038.jpg] HIEROGLYPHIC PLAN, BY HERMES, OF THE ANCIENT ZODIAC.The inner circle contains the hieroglyph of Hemphta, the triform andpantamorphic deity. In the six concentric bands surrounding the inner circle are(from within outward): (1) the numbers of the zodiacal houses in figures andalso in words; (2) the modern names of the houses; (3) the Greek or the Egyptiannames of the Egyptian deities assigned to the houses; (4) the complete figuresof these deities; (5) the ancient or the modern zodiacal signs, sometimes both;(6) the number of decans or subdivisions of the houses.The occultists of the ancient world had a most remarkable understanding of theprinciple of evolution. They recognized all life as being in various stages ofbecoming. They believed that grains of sand were in the process of becominghuman in consciousness but not necessarily in form; that human creatures were inthe process of becoming planets; that planets were in the process of becomingsolar systems; and that solar systems were in the process of becoming cosmicchains; and so on ad infinitum. One of the stages between the solar system andthe cosmic chain was called the zodiac; therefore they taught that at a certaintime a solar system breaks up into a zodiac. The houses of the zodiac become thethrones for twelve Celestial Hierarchies, or as certain of the ancients state,ten Divine Orders. Pythagoras taught that 10, or the unit of the decimal system,was the most perfect of all numbers, and he symbolized the number ten by thelesser tetractys, an arrangement of ten dots in the form of an upright triangle.The early star gazers, after dividing the zodiac into its houses, appointed thethree brightest stars in each constellation to be the joint rulers of thathouse. Then they divided the house into three sections of ten degrees each,which they called decans. These, in turn, were divided in half, resulting in thebreaking up of the zodiac into seventy-two duodecans of five degrees each. Overeach of these duodecans the Hebrews placed a celestial intelligence, or angel,and from this sytem has resulted the Qabbalistic arrangement of the seventy-twosacred names, which correspond to the seventy-two flowers, knops, and almondsupon the seven-branched Candlestick of the Tabernacle, and the seventy-two menwho were chosen from the Twelve Tribes to represent Israel.The only two signs not already mentioned are Gemini and Sagittarius. Theconstellation of Gemini is generally represented as two small children, who,according to the ancients, were born out of eggs, possibly the ones that theBull broke with his horns. The stories concerning Castor and Pollux, and Romulusand Remus, may be the result of amplifying the myths of these celestial Twins.The symbols of Gemini have passed through many modifications. The one used bythe Arabians was the peacock. Two of the important stars in the constellation ofGemini still bear the names of Castor and Pollux. The sign of Gemini is supposedto have been the patron of phallic worship, and the two obelisks, or pillars, infront of temples and churches convey the same symbolism as the Twins.The sign of Sagittarius consists of what the ancient Greeks called a centaur—acomposite creature, the lower half of whose body was in the form of a horse,while the upper half was human. The centaur is generally shown with a bow andarrow in his hands, aiming a shaft far off into the stars. Hence Sagittariusstands for two distinct principles: first, it represents the spiritual evolutionof man, for the human form is rising from the body of the beast; secondly, it isthe symbol of aspiration and ambition, for as the centaur aims his arrow at thestars, so every human creature aims at a higher mark than he can reach.Albert Churchward, in The Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man, sums up theinfluence of the zodiac upon religious symbolism in the following words: “Thedivision here [is] in twelve parts, the twelve signs of the Zodiac, twelvetribes of Israel, twelve gates of heaven mentioned in Revelation, and twelveentrances or portals to be passed through in the Great Pyramid, before finallyreaching the highest degree, and twelve Apostles in the Christian doctrines, andthe twelve original and perfect points in Masonry.”The ancients believed that the theory of man’s being made in the image of Godwas to be understood literally. They maintained that the universe was a greatorganism not unlike the human body, and that every phase and function of theUniversal Body had a correspondence in man. The most precious Key to Wisdom thatthe priests communicated to the new initiates was what they termed the law ofanalogy. Therefore, to the ancients, the study of the stars was a sacredscience, for they saw in the movements of the celestial bodies the ever-presentactivity of the Infinite Father.The Pythagoreans were often undeservedly criticized for promulgating theso-called doctrine of metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls. Thisconcept as circulated among the uninitiated was merely a blind, however, toconceal a sacred truth. Greek mystics believed that the spiritual nature of mandescended into material existence from the Milky Way—the seed ground ofsouls—through one of the twelve gates of the great zodiacal band. The spiritualnature was therefore said to incarnate in the form of the symbolic creaturecreated by Magian star gazers to represent the various zodiacal constellations.If the spirit incarnated through the sign of Aries, it was said to be born inthe body of a ram; if in Taurus, in the body of the celestial bull. All humanbeings were thus symbolized by twelve mysterious creatures through the naturesof which they were able to incarnate into the material world. The theory oftransmigration was not applicable to the visible material body of man, butrather to the invisible immaterial spirit wandering along the pathway of thestars and sequentially assuming in the course of evolution the forms of thesacred zodiacal animals.In the Third Book of the Mathesis of Julius Firmicus Maternus appears thefollowing extract concerning the positions of the heavenly bodies at the time ofthe establishment of the inferior universe: “According to Æsculapius, therefore,and Anubius, to whom especially the divinity Mercury committed the secrets ofthe astrological science, the geniture of the world is as follows: Theyconstituted the Sun in the 15th part of Leo, the Moon in the 15th part ofCancer, Saturn in the 15th part of Capricorn, Jupiter in the 15th part ofSagittary, Man in the 15th part of Scorpio, Venus in the 15th part of Libra,Mercury in the 15th part of Virgo, and the Horoscope in the 15th part of Cancer.Conformably to this geniture, therefore, to these conditions of the stars, andthe testimonies which they adduce in confirmation of this geniture, they are ofopinion that the destinies of men, also, are disposed in accordance with theabove arrangement as may be learnt from that book of Æsculapius which is calledMυρoγενεσς (i.e., Ten Thousand, or an innumerable multitude of Genitures), inorder that nothing in the several genitures of men may be found to be discordantwith the above-mentioned geniture of the world.” The seven ages of man are underthe control of the planets in the following order: infancy, the moon; childhood,Mercury; adolescence, Venus; maturity, the sun; middle age, Mars; advanced age,Jupiter; and decrepitude and dissolution, Saturn."},{"pageContent":"XI The Bembine Table of Isis Manuscript by Thomas Taylor contains the following remarkable paragraph:“Plato was initiated into the ‘Greater Mysteries’ at the age of 49. Theinitiation took place in one of the subterranean halls of the Great Pyramid inEgypt. The ISIAC TABLE formed the altar, before which the Divine Plato stood andreceived that which was always his, but which the ceremony of the Mysteriesenkindled and brought from its dormant state. With this ascent, after three daysin the Great Hall, he was received by the Hierophant of the Pyramid (thehierophant was seen only by those who had passed the three days, the threedegrees, the three dimensions) and given verbally the Highest EsotericTeachings, each accompanied with Its appropriate Symbol. After a further threemonths’ sojourn in the halls of the Pyramid, the Initiate Plato was sent outinto the world to do the work of the Great Order, as Pythagoras and Orpheus hadbeen before him.”Before the sacking of Rome in 1527 there is no historical mention of the MensaIsiaca (Tablet of Isis). At that time the Tablet came into the possession of acertain locksmith or ironworker, who sold it at an exorbitant price to CardinalBembo, a celebrated antiquary, historiographer of the Republic of Venice, andafterwards librarian of St. Mark’s. After his death in 1547 the Isiac Tablet wasacquired by the House of Mantua, in whose museum it remained until 1630, whentroops of Ferdinand II captured the city of Mantua. Several early writers on thesubject have assumed that the Tablet was demolished by the ignorant soldiery forthe silver it contained. The assumption, however, was erroneous. The Tablet fellinto the hands of Cardinal Pava, who presented it to the Duke of Savoy, who inturn presented it to the King of Sardinia. When the French conquered Italy in1797 the Tablet was carried to Paris. In 1809, Alexandre Lenoir, writing of theMensa Isiaca, said it was on exhibition at the Bibliothèque Nationale. Upon theestablishment of peace between the two countries it was returned to Italy. Inhis Guide to Northern Italy, Karl Baedeker describes the Mensa Isiaca as beingin the center of Gallery 2 in the Museum of Antiquities at Turin.038 [images/00039.jpg] LEVI’S KEY TO THE BEMBINE TABLE.“The Isiac Tablet, writes Levi, is a Key to the Ancient Book of Thoth, which hassurvived to some extent the lapse of centuries and is pictured to us in thestill comparatively ancient set of Tarocchi Cards. To him the Book of Thoth wasa résumé of the esoteric learning of the Egyptians, after the decadence of theircivilization, this tore became crystallized in an hieroglyphic form as theTarot; this Tarot having become partially or entirely forgotten ormisunderstood, its pictured symbols fell into the hands of the sham diviners,and of the providers of the public amusement by games of Cards. The modernTarot, or Tarocchi pack of cards consists of 78 cards, of which 22 form aspecial group of trumps, or pictorial design: the remaining 56 are composed offour suits of 10 numerals and four court cards. King, Queen, Knight, and Knaveor Valet; the suits are Swords (Militaryism), Cups (Sacerdocy), Clubs or Wands(Agriculture), and Shekels or Coins (Commerce), answering respectively to ourSpades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Our purpose is with the 22 trumps, theseform the special characteristic of the pack and are the lineal descendants ofthe Hieroglyphics of the Tarot. These 22 correspond to the letters of the Hebrewand other sacred alphabets, which fall naturally into three classes of a Trio ofMothers, a Heptad of doubles, and a duodecad of simple letters. They are alsoconsidered as a triad of Heptads and one apart a system of Initiation and anUninitiate.” (See Westcott’s The Isiac Tablet.)A faithful reproduction of the original Tablet was made in 1559 by thecelebrated Æneas Vicus of Parma, and a copy of the engraving was given by theChancellor of the Duke of Bavaria to the Museum of Hieroglyphics. AthanasiusKircher describes the Tablet as “five palms long and four wide.” W. WynnWestcott says it measures 50 by 30 inches. It was made of bronze and decoratedwith encaustic or smalt enamel and silver inlay. Fosbroke adds: “The figures arecut very shallow, and the contour of most of them is encircled by threads ofsilver. The bases upon which the figures were seated or reclined, and left blankin the prints, were of silver and are torn away.” (See Encyclopædia ofAntiquities.)Those familiar with the fundamental principles of Hermetic philosophy willrecognize in the Mensa Isiaca the key to Chaldean, Egyptian, and Greek theology.In his Antiquities, the learned Benedictine, Father Montfaucon, admits hisinability to cope with the intricacies of its symbolism. He therefore doubtsthat the emblems upon the Tablet possess any significance worthy ofconsideration and ridicules Kircher, declaring him to be more obscure than theTablet itself. Laurentius Pignorius reproduced the Tablet in connection with adescriptive essay in 1605, but his timidly advanced explanations demonstratedhis ignorance concerning the actual interpretation of the figures.In his Œdipus Ægyptiacus, published in 1654, Kircher attacked the problem withcharacteristic avidity. Being peculiarly qualified for such a task by years ofresearch in matters pertaining to the secret doctrines of antiquity, and withthe assistance of a group of eminent scholars, Kircher accomplished much towardsan exposition of the mysteries of the Tablet. The master secret, however, eludedeven him, as Eliphas Levi has shrewdly noted in his History of Magic.“The learned Jesuit,” writes Levi, “divined that it contained the hieroglyphickey to sacred alphabets, though he was unable to develop the explanation. It isdivided into three equal compartments; above are the twelve houses of heaven andbelow are the corresponding distributions of labor [work periods] throughout theyear, while in the middle place are twenty-one sacred signs answering to theletters of the alphabet. In the midst of all is a seated figure of thepantomorphic IYNX, emblem of universal being and corresponding as such to theHebrew Yod, or to that unique letter from which all the other letters wereformed. The IYNX is encircled by the Ophite triad, answering to the Three MotherLetters of the Egyptian and Hebrew alphabets. On the right are the Ibimorphicand Serapian triads; on the left are those of Nepthys and Hecate, representingactive and passive, fixed and volatile, fructifying fire and generating water.Each pair of triads in conjunction with the center produces a septenary, and aseptenary is contained in the center. The three septenaries furnish the absolutenumber of the three worlds, as well as the complete number of primitive letters,to which a complementary sign is added, like zero to the nine numerals.”Levi’s hint may be construed to mean that the twenty-one figures in the centersection of the Table represent the twenty-one major trumps of the Tarot cards.If this be so, is not the zero card, cause of so much controversy, the namelesscrown of the Supreme Mind, the crown being symbolized by the hidden triad in theupper part of the throne in the center of the Table? Might not the firstemanation of this Supreme Mind be well symbolized by a juggler or magician withthe symbols of the four lower worlds spread out on a table before him: the rod,the sword, the cup, and the coin? Thus considered, the zero card belongs nowhereamong the others but is in fact the fourth dimensional point from which they allemanated and consequently is broken up into the twenty-one cards (letters)which, when gathered together, produce the zero. The cipher appearing upon thiscard would substantiate this interpretation, for the cipher, or circle, isemblematic of the superior sphere from which issue the lower worlds, powers, andletters.Westcott carefully collected the all too meager theories advanced by variousauthorities and in 1887 published his now extremely rare volume, which containsthe only detailed description of the Isiac Tablet published in English sinceHumphreys translated Montfaucon’s worthless description in 1721. Afterexplaining his reticence to reveal that which Levi evidently felt was betterleft concealed, Westcott sums up his interpretation of the Tablet as follows:“The diagram of Levi, by which he explains the mystery of the Tablet, shows theUpper Region divided into the four seasons of the year, each with three signs ofthe Zodiac, and he has added the four-lettered sacred name, the Tetragrammaton,assigning Jod to Aquarius, that is Canopus, He to Taurus, that is Apis, Vau toLeo, that is Momphta, and He final to Typhon. Note the Cherubic parallel—Man,Bull, Lion and Eagle. The fourth form is found either as Scorpion or Eagledepending upon the Occult good or evil intention: in the Demotic Zodiac, theSnake replaces the Scorpion.“The Lower Region he ascribes to the twelve simple Hebrew letters, associatingthem with the four quarters of the horizon. Compare the Sepher Yetzirah, Cap.v., sec. 1.“The Central Region he ascribes to the Solar powers and the Planetary. In themiddle we see above, the Sun, marked Ops, and below it is a Solomon’s Seal,above a cross; a double triangle Hexapla, one light and one dark trianglesuperposed, the whole forming a sort of complex symbol of Venus. To the Ibi-morphos he gives the three dark planets, Venus, Mercury, and Mars placed arounda dark triangle erect, denoting Fire. To the Nephthæan triad he gives threelight planets, Saturn, Luna, and Jupiter, around a light inverted triangle whichdenotes Water. There is a necessary connection between water, female power,passive principle, Binah, and Sephirotic Mother, and Bride. (See the Kabbalah byMathers.) Note the ancient signs for the planets were all composed of a Cross,Solar Disc and Crescent: Venus is a cross below a Sun disc, Mercury, a disc witha crescent above and cross below, Saturn is a Cross whose lowest point touchesthe apex of the crescent; Jupiter is a Crescent whose lowest point touches theleft hand end of a cross: all these are deep mysteries. Note that Levi in hisoriginal plate transposed Serapis and Hecate, but not the Apis noir and Apisblanc, perhaps because of the head of Bes being associated by him with Hecate.Note that having referred the 12 simple letters to the lower, the 7 double mustcorrespond to the central region of the planets, and then the great triad A.M.S.the mother letters representing Air, Water, and Fire remain to be pictured,around S the Central lynx, or Yod, by the Ophionian Triad the two Serpents andthe Leonine Sphynx. Levi’s word OPS in the centre is the Latin Ops, Terra,genius of the Earth; and the Greek Ops, Rhea, or Kubele (Cybele) often drawn asa goddess seated in a chariot drawn by lions; she is crowned with turrets, andholds a Key.” (See The Isiac Tablet. )The essay published in French by Alexandre Lenoir in 1809, while curious andoriginal, contains little real information on the Tablet, which the author seeksto prove was an Egyptian calendar or astrological chart. As both Montfaucon andLenoir—in fact all writers on the subject since 1651—either have based theirwork upon that of Kircher or have been influenced considerably by him, a carefultranslation has been made of the latter’s original article (eighty pages ofseventeenth-century Latin). The double-page plate in the color insert is afaithful reproduction made by Kircher from the engraving in the Museum ofHieroglyphics. The small letters and numbers used to designate the figures wereadded by him to clarify his commentary and will be used for the same purpose inthis work.Like nearly all religious and philosophical antiquities, the Bembine Table ofIsis has been the subject of much controversy In a footnote, A. E. Waite—unableto differentiate between the true and the purported nature or origin of theTablet—echoes the sentiments of J. G. Wilkinson, another eminent exotericus:“The original [Table] is exceedingly late and is roughly termed a forgery.” Onthe other hand, Eduard Winkelmann, a man of profound learning, defends thegenuineness and antiquity of the Tablet. A sincere consideration of the MensaIsiaca discloses one fact of paramount importance: that although whoeverfashioned the Table was not necessarily an Egyptian, he was an initiate of thehighest order conversant with the most arcane tenets of Hermetic esotericism."},{"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE BEMBINE TABLE The following necessarily brief elucidation of the Bembine Table is based upon adigest of the writings of Kircher supplemented by other information gleaned bythe present author from the mystical writings of the Chaldeans, Hebrews,Egyptians, and Greeks. The temples of the Egyptians were so designed that thearrangement of chambers, decorations, and utensils was all of symbolicsignificance, as shown by the hieroglyphics that covered them. Beside the altar,which usually was in the center of each room, was the cistern of Nile waterwhich flowed in and out through unseen pipes. Here also were images of the godsin concatenated series, accompanied by magical inscriptions. In these temples,by use of symbols and hieroglyphics, neophytes were instructed in the secrets ofthe sacerdotal caste.The Tablet of Isis was originally a table or altar, and its emblems were part ofthe mysteries explained by priests. Tables were dedicated to the various godsand goddesses; in this case Isis was so honored. The substances from which thetables were made differed according to the relative dignities of the deities.The tables consecrated to Jupiter and Apollo were of gold; those to Diana,Venus, and Juno were of silver; those to the other superior gods, of marble;those to the lesser divinities, of wood. Tables were also made of metalscorresponding to the planets governed by the various celestials. As food for thebody is spread on a banquet table, so on these sacred altars were spread thesymbols which, when understood, feed the invisible nature of man.In his introduction to the Table, Kircher summarizes its symbolism thus: “Itteaches, in the first place, the whole constitution of the threefoldworld—archetypal, intellectual, and sensible. The Supreme Divinity is shownmoving from the center to the circumference of a universe made up of bothsensible and inanimate things, all of which are animated and agitated by the onesupreme power which they call the Father Mind and represented by a threefoldsymbol. Here also are shown three triads from the Supreme One, each manifestingone attribute of the first Trimurti. These triads are called the Foundation, orthe base of all things. In the Table is also set forth the arrangement anddistribution of those divine creatures that aid the Father Mind in the controlof the universe. Here [in the upper panel] are to be seen the Governors of theworlds, each with its fiery, ethereal, and material insignia. Here also [in thelower panel] are the Fathers of Fountains, whose duty it is to care for andpreserve the principles of all things and sustain the inviolable laws of Nature.Here are the gods of the spheres and also those who wander from place to place,laboring with all substances and forms (Zonia and Azonia), grouped together asfigures of both sexes, with their faces turned to their superior deity.”The Mensa Isiaca, which is divided horizontally into three chambers or panels,may represent the ground plan of the chambers in which the Isiac Mysteries weregiven. The center panel is divided into seven parts or lesser rooms, and thelower has two gates, one at each end. The entire Table contains forty-fivefigures of first importance and a number of lesser symbols. The forty-five mainfigures are grouped into fifteen triads, of which four are in the upper panel,seven in the central, and four in the lower. According to both Kircher and Levi,the triads are divided in the following manner:> IN THE UPPER SECTION> > > 1. P,S,V—Mendesian Triad.> > > 2. X, Z, A—Ammonian Triad.> > > 3. B, C, D—Momphtæan Triad.> > > 4. F, G, H—Omphtæan Triad.> > > > > > IN THE CENTER SECTION> > > 1. G, I, K—Isiac Triad.> > > 2. L, M, N—Hecatine Triad.> > > 3. O, Q, R—lbimorphous Triad.> > > 4. V, S, W—Ophionic Triad.> > > 5. X, Y, Z—Nephtæan Triad.> > > 6. ζ, η, θ—Serapæan Triad.> > > 7. γ, δ (not shown), ε—Osirian Triad.> > > > IN THE LOWER SECTION> > > 1. λ, M, N—Horæan Triad.> > > 2. ξ, O, Σ—Pandochæan Triad.> > > 3. T, Φ, X—Thaustic Triad.> > > 4. Ψ, F, H—Æluristic Triad.Of these fifteen triads Kircher writes: “The figures differ from each other ineight highly important respects, i.e., according to form, position, gesture,act, raiment, headdress, staff, and, lastly, according to the hieroglyphicsplaced around them, whether these be flowers, shrubs, small letters or animals.”These eight symbolic methods of portraying the secret powers of the figures aresubtle reminders of the eight spiritual senses of cognition by means of whichthe Real Self in man may be comprehended. To express this spiritual truth theBuddhists used the wheel with eight spokes and raised their consciousness bymeans of the noble eightfold path. The ornamented border enclosing the threemain panels of the Table contains many symbols consisting of birds, animals,reptiles, human beings, and composite forms. According to one reading of theTable, this border represents the four elements; the creatures are elementalbeings. According to another interpretation, the border represents diearchetypal spheres, and in its frieze of composite figures are the patterns ofthose forms which in various combinations will subsequently manifest themselvesin the material world. The four flowers at the corners of the Table are thosewhich, because their blossoms always face the sun and follow its course acrossthe sky, are sacred emblems of that finer part of man’s nature which delights infacing its Creator.According to the secret doctrine of the Chaldeans, the universe is divided intofour states of being (planes or spheres): archetypal, intellectual, sidereal,and elemental. Each of these reveals the others; the superior controlling theinferior, and the inferior receiving influence from the superior. The archetypalplane was considered synonymous with the intellect of the Triune Divinity Withinthis divine, incorporeal, and eternal sphere are included all the lowermanifestations of life—all that is, has been, or ever shall be. Within theKosmic Intellect all things spiritual or material exist as archetypes, or divinethought-forms, which is shown in the Table by a chain of secret similes.In the middle region of the Table appears the all-form-containing personifiedSpiritual Essence—the source and substance of all things. From this proceed thelower worlds as nine emanations in groups of three (the Ophionic, Ibimorphous,and Nephtæan Triads). Consider in this connection the analogy of the QabbalisticSephiroth, or the nine spheres issuing from Kether, the Crown. The twelveGovernors of the Universe (the Mendesian, Ammonian, Momphtæan, and OmphtæanTriads)—vehicles for the distribution of the creative influences, and shown inthe upper region of the Table—are directed in their activities by the DivineMind patterns existing in the archetypal sphere. The archetypes are abstractpatterns formulated in the Divine Mind and by them all the inferior activitiesare controlled. In the lower region of the Table are the Father Fountains (theHoræan, Pandochæan, Thaustic, and Æluristic Triads), keepers of the great gatesof the universe. These distribute to the lower worlds the influences descendingfrom the Governors shown above.In the theology of the Egyptians, goodness takes precedence and all thingspartake of its nature to a higher or lower degree. Goodness is sought by all. Itis the Prime Cause of causes. Goodness is self-diffused and hence exists in allthings, for nothing can produce that which it does not have in itself. The Tabledemonstrates that all is in God and God is in all; that all is in all and eachis in each. In the intellectual world are invisible spiritual counterparts ofthe crea-tures which inhabit the elemental world. Therefore, the lowest exhibitsthe highest, the corporeal declares the intellectual, and the invisible is mademanifest by its works. For this reason the Egyptians made images of substancesexisting in the inferior sensible world to serve as visible exemplars ofsuperior and invisible powers. To the corruptible images they assigned thevirtues of the incorruptible divinities, thus demonstrating arcanely that thisworld is but the shadow of God, the outward picture of the paradise within. Allthat is in the invisible archetypal sphere is revealed in the sensible corporealworld by the light of Nature.039 [images/00040.jpg] WESTCOTT’S KEY TO THE BEMBINE TABLE.Zoroaster declared that the number three shines throughout the world. This isrevealed in the Bembine Table by a series of triads representing the creativeimpulses. Of the Isiac Table, Atexandre Lenoir writes: “The Isiac Table, as awork of art, is not of great interest. It is but a composition, rather cold andinsignificant, whose figures, summarily sketched and methodically placed neareach other, give but little impression of life. But, if on the contrary, afterexamining it, we understand the purpose of the author, we become soon convincedthat the Isiac Table is an image of the heavenly sphere divided in small partsto be used very likely for general teaching. According to that idea, we canconclude that the Isiac Table was originally the introduction to a collectionfollowed by the Mysteries of Isis. It was engraved on copper in order to be usedin the ceremonial of initiation.” (See New Essay on the Isiac Table.) The Archetypal and Creative Mind—first through its Paternal Foundation andafterwards through secondary Gods called Intelligences—poured out the wholeinfinity of its powers by continuous exchange from highest to lowest. In theirphallic symbolism the Egyptians used the sperm to represent the spiritualspheres, because each contains all that comes forth from it. The Chaldeans andEgyptians also held that everything which is a result dwells in the cause ofitself and turns to that cause as the lotus to the sun. Accordingly, the SupremeIntellect, through its Paternal Foundation, first created light—the angelicworld. Out of that light were then created the invisible hierarchies of beingswhich some call the stars; and out of the stars the four elements and thesensible world were formed. Thus all are in all, after their respective kinds.All visible bodies or elements are in the invisible stars or spiritual elements,and the stars are likewise in those bodies; the stars are in the angels and theangels in the stars; the angels are in God and God is in all. Therefore, all aredivinely in the Divine, angelically in the angels, and corporeally in thecorporeal world, and vice versa. Just as the seed is the tree folded up, so theworld is God unfolded.Proclus says: “Every property of divinity permeates all creation and givesitself to all inferior creatures.” One of the manifestations of the Supreme Mindis the power of reproduction according to species which it confers upon everycreature of which it is the divine part. Thus souls, heavens, elements, animals,plants, and stones generate themselves each according to its pattern, but allare dependent upon the one fertilizing principle existing in the Supreme Mind.The fecundative power, though of itself a unit, manifests differently throughthe various substances, for in the mineral it contributes to material existence,in the plant it manifests as vitality, and in the animal as sensibility Itimparts motion to the heavenly bodies, thought to the souls of men,intellectuality to the angels, and superessentiality to God. Thus it is seenthat all forms are of one substance and all life of one force, and these areco-existent in the nature of the Supreme One.This doctrine was first expounded by Plato. His disciple, Aristotle, set itforth in these words: “We say that this Sensible World is an image of another;therefore since this world is vivid or alive, how much more, then, that othermust live. * * * Yonder, therefore, above the stellar virtues, stand otherheavens to be attained, like the heavens of this world; beyond them, becausethey are of a higher kind, brighter and vaster; nor are they distant from eachother like this one, for they are incorporeal. Yonder, too, exists an earth, notof inanimate matter, but vivid with animal life and all natural terrestrialphenomena like this one, but of other kinds and perfections. There are plants,also, and gardens, and flowing water; there are aquatic animals but of noblerspecies. Yonder is air and life appropriate to it, all immortal. And althoughthe life there is analogous to ours, yet it is nobler, seeing that it isintellectual, perpetual and unalterable. For if anyone should object and ask,How in the world above do the plants, etc. above mentioned find footing, weshould answer that they do not have objective existence, for they were producedby the primal Author in an absolute condition and without exteriorization. Theyare, therefore, in the same case as intellect and soul; they suffer no defectsuch as waste and corruption, since the beings yonder are full of energy,strength and joy, as living in a life sublime and being the issue of one fountand of one quality, compounded of all like sweet savors, delicate perfumes,harmonious color and sound, and other perfections. Nor do they move violentlyabout nor intermix nor corrupt each other, but each perfectly preserves its ownessential character; and they are simple and do not multiply as corporeal beingsdo.”In the midst of the Table is a great covered throne with a seated female figurerepresenting Isis, but here called the Pantomorphic IYNX. G.R.S. Mead definesthe IYNX as “a transmitting intelligence.” Others have declared it to be asymbol of Universal Being. Over the head of the goddess the throne is surmountedby a triple crown, and beneath her feet is the house of material substance. Thethreefold crown is here symbolic of the Triune Divinity, called by the Egyptiansthe Supreme Mind, and described in the Sepher ha Zohar as being “hidden andunrevealed.” According to the Hebrew system of Qabbalism, the Tree of theSephiroth was divided into two parts, the upper invisible and the lower visible.The upper consisted of three parts and the lower of seven. The threeuncognizable Sephiroth were called Kether, the Crown; Chochmah, Wisdom; andBinah, Understanding. These are too abstract to permit of comprehension, whereasthe lower seven spheres that came forth from them were within the grasp of humanconsciousness. The central panel contains seven triads of figures. Theserepresent the lower Sephiroth, all emanating from the concealed threefold crownover the throne.Kircher writes: “The throne denotes the diffusion of the triform Supreme Mindalong the universal paths of the three worlds. Out of these three intangiblespheres emerges the sensible universe, which Plutarch calls the ‘House of Horus’and the Egyptians, the ‘Great Gate of the Gods.’ The top of the throne is in themidst of diffused serpent-shaped flames, indicating that the Supreme Mind isfilled with light and life, eternal and incorruptible, removed from all materialcontact. How the Supreme Mind communicated His fire to all creatures is clearlyset forth in the symbolism of the Table. The Divine Fire is communicated tolower spheres through the universal power of Nature personified by the WorldVirgin, Isis, here denominated the IYNX, or the polymorphous all-containingUniversal Idea.” The word Idea is here used in its Platonic sense. “Platobelieved that there are eternal forms of all possible things which exist withoutmatter; and to these eternal and immaterial forms he gave the name of ideas. Inthe Platonic sense, ideas were the patterns according to which the Deityfashioned the phenomenal or ectypal world.” (Sir W. Hamilton.)Kircher describes the 21 figures in the central panel thus: “Seven principaltriads, corresponding to seven superior worlds, are shown in the central sectionof the Table. They all originate from the fiery, invisible archetype [the triplecrown of the throne]. The first, the Ophionic or IYNX Triad, V S W, correspondsto the vital and fiery world and is the first intellectual world, called by theancients the Aetherium. Zoroaster says of it: ‘Oh, what rigorous rulers thisworld has!’ The second, or Ibimorphous Triad, O Q R, corresponds to the secondintellectual, or ethereal, world, and is concerned with the principle ofhumidity. The third, or Nephtæan Triad, X Y Z, corresponds to the thirdintellectual and ethereal [world] and is concerned with fecundity These are thethree triads of the ethereal worlds, which correspond to the Father Foundation.Then follow the four triads of the sensible, or material, worlds, of which thefirst two correspond to the sidereal worlds, GIKand γ δ e, namely, Osiris andIsis, Sun and Moon, indicated by two bulls. They are followed by two triads—theHecatine, L M N,and the Serapæan, ζ η θ, corresponding to the sublunary andsubterranean worlds. These complete the seven worlds of primary Genii ruling thenatural universe. Psellus quotes Zoroaster: ‘The Egyptians and the Chaldeanstaught that there were seven corporeal worlds (i.e., worlds ruled by theintellectual powers); the first is of pure fire; the second, third, and fourth,ethereal; the fifth, six, and seventh, material; the seventh being the onecalled terrestrial and hater of light, and is located under the Moon, comprisingwithin itself the matter called fundus, or foundation.’ These seven, plus theone invisible crown, constitute the eight worlds. * * *“Plato writes that it is needful for the philosopher to know how the sevencircles beneath the first one are arranged according to the Egyptians. The firsttriad of fire denotes life; the second, water, over which rule the Ibimorphousdivinities; and the third, air, ruled by Nephta. From the fire the heavens werecreated, from the water the earth, and air was the mediator between them. In theSephira Yetzirah it is said that from the three originate the seven, i. e., theheight, the depth, the East, the West, the North, and the South, and the HolyTemple in the center sustaining them all. Is not the Holy Temple in the centerthe great throne of the many-formed Spirit of Nature which is shown in themiddle of the Tablet? What are the seven triads but the seven Powers that ruleover the world? Psellus writes: ‘The Egyptians worshipped the triad of faith,truth, and love; and the seven fountains: the Sun as ruler—the fountain ofmatter; then the fountain of the archangels; the fountain of the senses; ofjudgment; of lightning; of reflections; and of characters of unknowncomposition. They say that the highest material fountains are those of Apollo,Osiris, and Mercury—the fountains of the centers of the elements.’ Thus, theyunderstood by the Sun as ruler the solar world; by the material archangelic, thelunar world; by the fountain of the senses, the world of Saturn; by judgment,Jupiter; by lightning, Mars; by that of the reflections, or mirrors, the worldof Venus; by the fountain of characters, the world of Mercury. All these areshown by the figures in the center pane of the Tablet.”The upper panel contains the twelve figures of the zodiac arranged in fourtriads. The center figure in each group represents one of the four fixed signsof the zodiac. S is the sign of Aquarius; Z, Taurus; C, Leo; and G, Scorpio.These are called the Fathers. In the secret teachings of the Far East these fourfigures—the man, the bull, the lion, and the eagle—are called the winged globesor the four Maharajahs who stand upon the corners of creation. The four cardinalsigns—P, Capricorn; X, Aries; B, Cancer; F, Libra—are called the Powers. Thefour common signs—V, Pisces; A, Gemini; E, Virgo; H, Sagittarius—are called theMinds of the Four Lords. This explains the meaning of the winged globes ofEgypt, for the four central figures—Aquarius, Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio (calledby Ezekiel the Cherubim)—are the globes; the cardinal and common signs on eitherside are the wings. Therefore the twelve signs of the zodiac may be symbolizedby four globes, each with two wings.The celestial triads are further shown by the Egyptians as a globe (the Father)from which issue a serpent (the Mind) and wings (the Power). These twelve forcesare the fabricators of the world, and from them emanate the microcosm, or themystery of the twelve sacred animals—representing in the universe the twelveparts of the world and in man the twelve parts of the human body. Anatomically,the twelve figures in the upper panel may well symbolize the twelve convolutionsof the brain and the twelve figures in the lower panel the twelve zodiacalmembers and organs of the human body, for man is a creature formed of the twelvesacred animals with his members and organs under the direct control of thetwelve governors or powers resident in the brain.A more profound interpretation is found in the correspondences between thetwelve figures in the upper panel and the twelve in the lower. This furnishes akey to one of the most arcane of ancient secrets—the relationship existingbetween the two great zodiacs—the fixed and the movable. The fixed zodiac isdescribed as an immense dodecahedron, its twelve surfaces representing theoutermost walls of abstract space. From each surface of this dodecahedron agreat spiritual power, radiating inward, becomes embodied as one of thehierarchies of the movable zodiac, which is a band of circumambulating so-calledfixed stars. Within this movable zodiac are posited the various planetary andelemental bodies. The relation of these two zodiacs to the subzodiacal sphereshas a correlation in the respiratory system of the human body. The great fixedzodiac may be said to represent the atmosphere, the movable zodiac the lungs,and the subzodiacal worlds the body. The spiritual atmosphere containing thevivifying energies of the twelve divine powers of the great fixed zodiac isinhaled by the cosmic lungs—the movable zodiac—and distributed by them throughthe constitution of the twelve holy animals which are the parts and members ofthe material universe. The functional cycle is completed when the poisonouseffluvia of the lower worlds collected by the movable zodiac are exhaled intothe great fixed zodiac, there to be purified by being passed through the divinenatures of its twelve eternal hierarchies.The Table as a whole is susceptible of many interpretations. If the border ofthe Table with its hieroglyphic figures be accepted as the spiritual source,then the throne in the center represents the physical body within which humannature is enthroned. From this point of view the entire Table becomes emblematicof the auric bodies of man, with the border as the outer extremity or shell ofthe auric egg. If the throne be accepted as the symbol of the spiritual sphere,the border typifies the elements, and the various panels surrounding the centralone become emblematic of the worlds or planes emanating from the one divinesource. If the Table be considered from a purely physical basis, the thronebecomes symbolic of the generative system and the Table reveals the secretprocesses of embryology as applied to the formation of the material worlds. If apurely physiological and anatomical interpretation be desired, the centralthrone becomes the heart, the Ibimorphous Triad the mind, the Nephtæan Triad thegenerative system, and the surrounding hieroglyphics the various parts andmembers of the human body. From the evolutionary viewpoint the central gatebecomes the point of both entrance and exit. Here also is set forth the processof initiation, in which the candidate after passing successfully through thevarious ordeals is finally brought into the presence of his own soul, which healone is capable of unveiling.If cosmogony be the subject of consideration, the central panel represents thespiritual worlds, the upper panel the intellectual worlds, and the lower panelthe material worlds. The central panel may also symbolize the nine invisibleworlds, and the creature marked T the physical nature—the footstool of Isis, theSpirit of Universal Life. Considered in the light of alchemy, the central panelcontains the metals and the borders the alchemical processes. The figure seatedon the throne is the Universal Mercury—the “stone of the wise”; the flamingcanopy of the throne above is the Divine Sulphur; and the cube of earth beneathis the elemental salt.The three triads—or the Paternal Foundation—in the central panel represent theSilent Watchers, the three invisible parts of the nature of man; the two panelson either side are the quaternary lower nature of man. In the central panel are21 figures. This number is sacred to the sun—which consists of three greatpowers, each with seven attributes—and by Qabbalistic reduction 21 becomes 3, orthe Great Triad.It will yet be proved that the Table of Isis is directly connected with EgyptianGnosticism, for in a Gnostic papyrus preserved in the Bodleian Library there isa direct reference to the twelve Fathers or Paternities beneath whom are twelveFountains. (See Egyptian Magic by S.S.D.D.) That the lower panel represents theunderworld is further emphasized by the two gates—the great gate of the East andthe great gate of the West—for in the Chaldean theology the sun rises and setsthrough gates in the underworld, where it wanders during the hours of darkness.As Plato was for thirteen years under the instruction of the Magi Patheneith,Ochoaps, Sechtnouphis, and Etymon of Sebbennithis, his philosophy consequentlyis permeated with the Chaldean and Egyptian system of triads. The Bembine Tableis a diagrammatic exposition of the so-called Platonic philosophy, for in itsdesign is epitomized the entire theory of mystic cosmogony and generation. Themost valuable guide to the interpretation of this Table is the Commentaries ofProclus on the Theology of Plato. The Chaldean Oracles of Zaroaster alsocontains many allusions to the theogonic principles which are demonstrated bythe Table.The Theogony of Hesiod contains the most complete account of the Greek cosmogonymyth. Orphic cosmogony has left its impress upon the various forms of philosophyand religion—Greek,Egyptian, and Syrian—which it contacted. Chief of the Orphicsymbols was the mundane egg from which Phanes sprang into light. Thomas Taylorconsiders the Orphic egg to be synonymous with the mixture from bound andinfinity mentioned by Plato in the Philebus. The egg is furthermore the thirdIntelligible Triad and the proper symbol of the Demiurgus, whose auric body isthe egg of the inferior universe.Eusebius, on the authority of Porphyry, declared that the Egyptians acknowledgedone intellectual Author or Creator of the world under the name of Cneph and thatthey worshiped him in a statue of human form and dark blue complexion, holdingin his hand a girdle and a scepter, wearing on his head a royal plume, andthrusting forth an egg out of his mouth. (See An Analysis of the EgyptianMythology.) While the Bembine Table is rectangular-shaped, it signifiesphilosophically the Orphic egg of the universe with its contents. In theesoteric doctrines the supreme individual achievement is the breaking of theOrphic egg, which is equivalent to the return of the spirit to the Nirvana—theabsolute condition—of the Oriental mystics.The New Pantheon by Samuel Boyse contains three plates showing various sectionsof the Bembine Table. The author, however, makes no important contribution tothe knowledge of the subject. In The Mythology and Fables of the AncientsExplained from History, the Abbé Banier devotes a chapter to a consideration ofthe Mensa Isiaca. After reviewing the conclusions of Montfaucon, Kircher, andPignorius, he adds: “I am of the opinion that it was a votive table, which someprince or private person had consecrated to Isis, as an acknowledgment for somebenefit which he believed she had conferred upon him.”"},{"pageContent":"XII Wonders of Antiquity It was a common practice among the early Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to seallighted lamps in the sepulchers of their dead as offerings to the God of Death.Possibly it was also believed that the deceased could use these lights infinding his way through the Valley of the Shadow. Later as the custom becamegenerally established, not only actual lamps but miniatures of them in terracotta were buried with the dead. Some of the lamps were enclosed in circularvessels for protection; and instances have been recorded in which the originaloil was found in them, in a perfect state of preservation, after more than 2,000years. There is ample proof that many of these lamps were burning when thesepulchers were sealed, and it has been declared that they were still burningwhen the vaults were opened hundreds of years later. The possibility ofpreparing a fuel which would renew itself as rapidly as it was consumed has beena source of considerable controversy among mediaeval authors. After dueconsideration of the evidence at hand, it seems well within the range ofpossibility that the ancient priest-chemists did manufacture lamps that burned,if not indefinitely, at least for considerable periods of time.Numerous authorities have written on the subject of ever-burning lamps. W. WynnWestcott estimates the number of writers who have given the subjectconsideration as more than 150, and H. P. Blavatsky as 173. While conclusionsreached by different authors are at variance, a majority admit the existence ofthese phenomenal lamps. Only a few maintained that the lamps would burn forever,but many were willing to concede that they might remain alight for severalcenturies without replenishment of the fuel. Some considered the so-calledperpetual lights as mere artifices of the crafty pagan priests, while a greatmany, admitting that the lamps actually burned, made the sweeping assertion thatthe Devil was using this apparent miracle to ensnare the credulous and therebylead their souls to perdition.On this subject the learned Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, usually dependable,exhibits a striking inconsistency. In his Œdipus Ægyptiacus he writes: “Not afew of these everburning lamps have been found to be the devices of devils, * ** And I take it that all the lamps found in the tombs of the Gentiles dedicatedto the worship of certain gods, were of this kind, not because they burned, orhave been reported to burn, with a perpetual flame, but because probably thedevil set them there, maliciously intending thereby to obtain fresh credence fora false worship.”Having admitted that dependable authorities defend the existence of theever-burning lamps, and that even the Devil lends himself to their manufacture,Kircher next declared the entire theory to be desperate and impossible, and tobe classed with perpetual motion and the Philosopher’s Stone. Having alreadysolved the problem to his satisfaction once, Kircher solves it again—butdifferently—in the following words: “In Egypt there are rich deposits of asphaltand petroleum. What did those clever fellows [the priests] do, then, but connectan oil deposit by a secret duct with one or more lamps, provided with wicks ofabestos! How could such lamps help burning perpetually? * * * In my opinion thisis the solution of the riddle of the supernatural everlastingness of theseancient lamps.”040 [images/00041.jpg] BASE OF A DELPHIAN TRIPOD.The windings of these serpents formed the base, and the three heads sustainedthe three feet of the tripod. It is impossible to secure satisfactoryinformation concerning the shape and size of the celebrated Delphian tripod.Theories concerning it are based (in most part) upon small ornamental tripodsdiscovered in various temples.Montfaucon, in his Antiquities, agrees in the main with the later deductions ofKircher, believing the fabled perpetual lamps of the temples to be cunningmechanical contrivances. He further adds that the belief that lamps burnedindefinitely in tombs was the result of the noteworthy fact that in some casesfumes resembling smoke poured forth from the entrances of newly opened vaults.Parties going in later and discovering lamps scattered about the floor assumedthat they were the source of the fumes.There are several interesting stories concerning the discoveries of ever-burning lamps in various parts of the world. In a tomb on the Appian Way whichwas opened during the papacy of Paul III was found a burning lamp which hadremained alight in a hermetically sealed vault for nearly 1,600 years. Accordingto an account written by a contemporary, a body—that of a young and beautifulgirl with long golden hair—was found floating in an unknown transparent liquidand as well preserved as though death had occurred but a few hours before. Aboutthe interior of the vault were a number of significant objects, which includedseveral lamps, one of them alight. Those entering the sepulcher declared thatthe draft caused by the opening of the door blew out the light and the lampcould not be relighted. Kircher reproduces an epitaph, “TULLI-OLAE FILIAE MEAE,”supposedly found in the tomb, but which Montfaucon declares never existed, thelatter adding that although conclusive evidence was not found, the body wasgenerally believed to be that of Tulliola, the daughter of Cicero.Ever-burning lamps have been discovered in all parts of the world. Not only theMediterranean countries but also India, Tibet, China, and South America havecontributed records of lights which burned continuously without fuel. Theexamples which follow were selected at random from the imposing list ofperpetual lamps found in different ages.Plutarch wrote of a lamp that burned over the door of a temple to Jupiter Ammon;the priests declared that it had remained alight for centuries without fuel.St. Augustine described a perpetual lamp, guarded in a temple in Egypt sacred toVenus, which neither wind nor water could extinguish. He believed it to be thework of the Devil.An ever-burning lamp was found at Edessa, or Antioch, during the reign of theEmperor Justinian. It was in a niche over the city gate, elaborately enclosed toprotect it from the elements. The date upon it proved that the lamp had beenburning for more than 500 years. It was destroyed by soldiers.During the early Middle Ages a lamp was found in England which had burned sincethe third century after Christ. The monument containing it was believed to bethe tomb of the father of Constantine the Great.The Lantern of Pallas was discovered near Rome in A.D. 1401. It was found in thesepulcher of Pallas, Son of Evander, immortalized by Virgil in his Æneid. Thelamp was placed at the head of the body and had burned with a steady glow formore than 2,000 years.In A.D. 1550 on the island of Nesis, in the Bay of Naples, a magnificent marblevault was opened in which was found a lamp still alight which had been placedthere before the beginning of the Christian Era.Pausanias described a beautiful golden lamp in the temple of Minerva whichburned steadily for a year without refueling or having the wick trimmed. Theceremony of filling the lamp took place annually, and time was measured by theceremony.According to the Fama Fraternitatis, the crypt of Christian Rosencreutz whenopened 120 years after his death was found to be brilliantly illuminated by aperpetual lamp suspended from the ceiling.Numa Pompilius, King of Rome and magician of considerable power, caused aperpetual light to burn in the dome of a temple he had created in honor of anelemental being.In England a curious tomb was found containing an automaton which moved whencertain stones in the floor of the vault were stepped upon by an intruder. Atthat time the Rosicrucian controversy was at its height, so it was decided thatthe tomb was that of a Rosicrucian initiate. A countryman, discovering the tomband entering, found the interior brilliantly lighted by a lamp hanging from theceiling. As he walked, his weight depressed some of the floor stones. At once aseated figure in heavy armor began to move. Mechanically it rose to its feet andstruck the lamp with an iron baton, completely destroying it, and thuseffectually preventing the discovery of the secret substance which maintainedthe flame. How long the lamp had burned is unknown, but certainly it had beenfor a considerable number of years.It is related that among the tombs near Memphis and in the Brahmin temples ofIndia lights have been found in sealed chambers and vessels, but sudden exposureto the air has extinguished them and caused their fuel to evaporate.It is now believed that the wicks of these perpetual lamps were made of braidedor woven asbestos, called by the alchemists salamander’s wool, and that the fuelwas one of the products of alchemical research. Kircher attempted to extract oilfrom asbestos, being convinced that as the substance itself was indestructibleby fire an oil extracted from it would supply the lamp with a fuel likewiseindestructible. After spending two years in fruitless experimental work, heconcluded that the task was impossible of accomplishment.Several formulae for the making of the fuel for the lamps have been preserved.In Isis Unveiled, H. P. Blavatsky reprints two of these formulæ from earlyauthors—Tritenheim and Bartolomeo Korndorf. One will suffice to give a generalunderstanding of the process:“Sulphur. Alum ust. a 3 iv.; sublime them into flowers to 3 ij., of which add ofcrystalline Venetian borax (powdered) 3 j.; upon these affuse high rectifiedspirit of wine and digest it, then abstract it and pour on fresh; repeat this sooften till the sulphur melts like wax without any smoke, upon a hot plate ofbrass: this is for the pabulum, but the wick is to be prepared after thismanner: gather the threads or thrums of the Lapis asbestos, to the thickness ofyour middle and the length of your little finger, then put them into a Venetianglass, and covering them over with the aforesaid depurated sulphur or alimentset the glass in sand for the space of twenty-four hours, so hot that thesulphur may bubble all the while. The wick being thus besmeared and anointed, isto be put into a glass like a scallop-shell, in such manner that some part of itmay lie above the mass of prepared sulphur; then setting this glass upon hotsand, you must melt the sulphur, so that it may lay hold of the wick, and whenit is lighted, it will burn with a perpetual flame and you may set this lamp inany place where you please.”"},{"pageContent":"THE GREEK ORACLES The worship of Apollo included the establishment and maintenance of places ofprophecy by means of which the gods could communicate with mankind and revealfuturity to such as deserved the boon. The early history of Greece abounds withaccounts of talking trees, rivers, statues, and caves in which nymphs, dryads,or dæmons had taken up their abodes and from which they delivered oracles. WhileChristian authors have tried to prove that oracular revelations were deliveredby the Devil for the purpose of misleading humanity, they have not dared toattack the theory of oracles, because of the repeated reference to it in theirown sacred writings. If the onyx stones on the shoulders of Israel’s high priestmade known by their flashings the will of Jehovah, then a black dove,temporarily endowed with the faculty of speech, could indeed pronounce oraclesin the temple of Jupiter Ammon. If the witch of Endor could invoke the shade ofSamuel, who in turn gave prophecies to Saul, could not a priestess of Apollocall up the specter of her leige to foretell the destiny of Greece?The most famous oracles of antiquity were those of Delphi, Dodona, Trophonius,and Latona, of which the talking oak trees of Dodona were the oldest. Though itis impossible to trace back to the genesis of the theory of oracular prophecy,it is known that many of the caves and fissures set aside by the Greeks asoracles were sacred long before the rise of Greek culture.The oracle of Apollo at Delphi remains one of the unsolved mysteries of theancients. Alexander Wilder derives the name Delphi from delphos, the womb. Thisname was chosen by the Greeks because of the shape of the cavern and the ventleading into the depths of the earth. The original name of the oracle was Pytho,so called because its chambers had been the abode of the great serpent Python, afearsome creature that had crept out of the slime left by the receding floodthat had destroyed all human beings except Deucalion and Pyrrha. Apollo,climbing the side of Mount Parnassus, slew the serpent after a prolonged combat,and threw the body down the fissure of the oracle. From that time the Sun God,surnamed the Pythian Apollo, gave oracles from the vent. With Dionysos he sharedthe honor of being the patron god of Delphi.After being vanquished by Apollo, the spirit of Python remained at Delphi as therepresentative of his conqueror, and it was with the aid of his effluvium thatthe priestess was able to become en rapport with the god. The fumes rising fromthe fissure of the oracle were supposed to come from the decaying body ofPython. The name Pythoness, or Pythia, given to the female hierophant of theoracle, means literally one who has been thrown into a religious frenzy byinhaling fumes rising from decomposing matter. It is of further interest to notethat the Greeks believed the oracle of Delphi to be the umbilicus of the earth,thus proving that they considered the planet an immense human being. Theconnection between the principle of oracular revelation and the occultsignificance of the navel is an important secret belonging to the ancientMysteries.The oracle, however, is much older than the foregoing account indicates. A storyof this kind was probably invented by the priests to explain the phenomena tothose inquisitive persons whom they did not consider worthy of enlightenmentregarding the true esoteric nature of the oracle. Some believe that the Delphicfissure was discovered by a Hypoborean priest, but as far back as recordedhistory goes the cave was sacred, and persons came from all parts of Greece andthe surrounding countries to question the dæmon who dwelt in its chimney-likevent. Priests and priestesses guarded it closely and served the spirit who dwelttherein and who enlightened humanity through the gift of prophecy.The story of the original discovery of the oracle is somewhat as follows:Shepherds tending their flocks on the side of Mount Parnassus were amazed at thepeculiar antics of goats that wandered close to a great chasm on itssouthwestern spur. The animals jumped about as though trying to dance, andemitted strange cries unlike anything before heard. At last one of theshepherds, curious to learn the cause of the phenomenon, approached the vent,from which were rising noxious fumes. Immediately he was seized with a propheticecstasy; he danced with wild abandon, sang, jabbered inarticulate sounds, andforetold future events. Others went close to the fissure, with the same result.The fame of the place spread, and many came to learn of the future by inhalingthe mephitic fumes, which exhilarated to the verge of delirium.Some of those who came, being unable to control themselves, and havingtemporarily the strength of madmen, tore themselves from those seeking torestrain them, and, jumping into the vent, perished. In order to prevent othersfrom doing likewise, a wall was erected around the fissure and a prophetess wasappointed to act as mediator between the oracle and those who came to questionit. According to later authorities, a tripod of gold, ornamented with carvingsof Apollo in the form of Python, the great serpent, was placed over the cleft,and on this was arranged a specially prepared seat, so constructed that a personwould have difficulty in falling off while under the influence of the oracularfumes. Just before this time, a story had been circulated that the fumes of theoracle arose from the decaying body of Python. It is possible that the oraclerevealed its own origin.For many centuries during its early history, virgin maidens were consecrated tothe service of the oracle. They were called the Phœbades, or Pythiœ, andconstituted that famous order now known as the Pythian priesthood. It isprobable that women were chosen to receive the oracles because their sensitiveand emotional nature responded more quickly and completely to “the fumes ofenthusiasm.” Three days before the time set to receive the communications fromApollo, the virgin priestess began the ceremony of purification. She bathed inthe Castalian well, abstained from all food, drank only from the fountain ofCassotis, which was brought into the temple through concealed pipes, and justbefore mounting the tripod, she chewed a few leaves of the sacred bay tree. Ithas been said that the water was drugged to bring on distorted visions, or thepriests of Delphi were able to manufacture an exhilarating and intoxicating gas,which they conducted by subterranean ducts and released into the shaft of theoracle several feet below the surface. Neither of these theories has beenproved, however, nor does either in any way explain the accuracy of thepredictions.When the young prophetess had completed the process of purification, she wasclothed in sanctified raiment and led to the tripod, upon which she seatedherself, surrounded by the noxious vapors rising from the yawning fissure.Gradually, as she inhaled the fumes, a change came over her. It was as if adifferent spirit had entered her body. She struggled, tore her clothing, anduttered inarticulate cries. After a time her struggles ceased. Upon becomingcalm a great majesty seemed to possess her, and with eyes fixed on space andbody rigid, she uttered the prophetic words. The predictions were usually in theform of hexameter verse, but the words were often ambiguous and sometimesunintelligible. Every sound that she made, every motion of her body, wascarefully recorded by the five Hosii, or holy men, who were appointed as scribesto preserve the minutest details of each divination. The Hosii were appointedfor life, and were chosen from the direct descendants of Deucalion.After the oracle was delivered, the Pythia began to struggle again, and thespirit released her. She was then carried or supported to a chamber of rest,where she remained till the nervous ecstasy had passed away.Iamblichus, in his dissertation on The Mysteries, describes how the spirit ofthe oracle—a fiery dæmon, even Apollo himself—took control of the Pythoness andmanifested through her: “But the prophetess in Delphi, whether she gives oraclesto mankind through an attenuated and fiery spirit, bursting from the mouth ofthe cavern; or whether being seated in the adytum on a brazen tripod, or on astool with four feet, she becomes sacred to the God; whichsoever of these is thecase, she entirely gives herself up to a divine spirit, and is illuminated witha ray of divine fire. And when, indeed, fire ascending from the mouth of thecavern circularly invests her in collected abundance, she becomes filled from itwith a divine splendour. But when she places herself on the seat of the God, shebecomes coadapted to his stable prophetic power: and from both of thesepreparatory operations she becomes wholly possessed by the God. And then,indeed, he is present with and illuminates her in a separate manner, and isdifferent from the fire, the spirit, the proper seat, and, in short, from allthe visible apparatus of the place, whether physical or sacred.”Among the celebrities who visited the oracle of Delphi were the immortalApollonius of Tyana and his disciple Damis. He made his offerings and, afterbeing crowned with a laurel wreath and given a branch of the same plant to carryin his hand, he passed behind the statue of Apollo which stood before theentrance to the cave, and descended into the sacred place of the oracle. Thepriestess was also crowned with laurel and her head bound with a band of whitewool. Apollonius asked the oracle if his name would be remembered by futuregenerations. The Pythoness answered in the affirmative, but declared that itwould always be calumniated. Apollonius left the cavern in anger, but time hasproved the accuracy of the prediction, for the early church fathers perpetuatedthe name of Apollonius as the Antichrist. (For details of the story see Histoirede la Magie. )The messages given by the virgin prophetess were turned over to the philosophersof the oracle, whose duty it was to interpret and apply them. The communicationswere then delivered to the poets, who immediately translated them into odes andlyrics, setting forth in exquisite form the statements supposedly made by Apolloand making them available for the populace.Serpents were much in evidence at the oracle of Delphi. The base of the tripodupon which the Pythia sat was formed of the twisted bodies of three giganticsnakes. According to some authorities, one of the processes used to produce theprophetic ecstasy was to force the young priestess to gaze into the eyes of aserpent. Fascinated and hypnotized, she then spoke with the voice of the god.Although the early Pythian priestesses were always maidens—some still in theirteens—a law was later enacted that only women past fifty years of age should bethe mouthpiece of the oracle. These older women dressed as young girls and wentthrough the same ceremonial as the first Pythiae. The change was probably theindirect result of a series of assaults made upon the persons of the priestessesby the profane.During the early history of the Delphian oracle the god spoke only at eachseventh birthday of Apollo. As time went on, however, the demand became so greatthat the Pythia was forced to seat herself upon the tripod every month. Thetimes selected for the consultation and the questions to be asked weredetermined by lot or by vote of the inhabitants of Delphi.It is generally admitted that the effect of the Delphian oracle upon Greekculture was profoundly constructive. James Gardner sums up its influence in thefollowing words: “Its responses revealed many a tyrant and foretold his fate.Through its means many an unhappy being was saved from destruction and many aperplexed mortal guided in the right way. It encouraged useful institutions, andpromoted the progress of useful discoveries. Its moral influence was on the sideof virtue, and its political influence in favor of the advancement of civilliberty.” (See The Faiths of The World.)The oracle of Dodona was presided over by Jupiter, who uttered propheciesthrough oak trees, birds, and vases of brass. Many writers have noted thesimilarities between the rituals of Dodona and those of the Druid priests ofBritain and Gaul. The famous oracular dove of Dodona, alighting upon thebranches of the sacred oaks, not only discoursed at length in the Greek tongueupon philosophy and religion, but also answered the queries of those who camefrom distant places to consult it.The “talking” trees stood together, forming a sacred grove. When the priestsdesired answers to important questions, after careful and solemn purificationsthey retired to the grove. They then accosted the trees, beseeching a reply fromthe god who dwelt therein. When they had stated their questions, the trees spokewith the voices of human beings, revealing to the priests the desiredinformation. Some assert that there was but one tree which spoke—an oak or abeech standing in the very heart of the ancient grove. Because Jupiter wasbelieved to inhabit this tree he was sometimes called Phegonœus, or one wholives in a beech tree.Most curious of the oracles of Dodona were the “talking” vases, or kettles.These were made of brass and so carefully fashioned that when struck they gaveoff sound for hours. Some writers have described a row of these vases and havedeclared that if one of them was struck its vibrations would be communicated toall the others and a terrifying din ensue. Other authors describe a large singlevase, standing upon a pillar, near which stood another column, supporting thestatue of a child holding a whip. At the end of the whip were a number ofswinging cords tipped with small metal balls, and the wind, which blewincessantly through the open building, caused the balls to strike against thevase. The number and intensity of the impacts and the reverberations of the vasewere all carefully noted, and the priests delivered their oracles accordingly.When the original priests of Dodona—the Selloi—mysteriously vanished, the oraclewas served for many centuries by three priestesses who interpreted the vases andat midnight interrogated the sacred trees. The patrons of the oracles wereexpected to bring offerings and to make contributions.Another remarkable oracle was the Cave of Trophonius, which stood upon the sideof a hill with an entrance so small that it seemed impossible for a human beingto enter. After the consultant had made his offering at the statue of Trophoniusand had donned the sanctified garments, he climbed the hill to the cave,carrying in one hand a cake of honey. Sitting down at the edge of the opening,he lowered his feet into the cavern. Thereupon his entire body was precipitatelydrawn into the cave, which was described by those who had entered it as havingonly the dimensions of a fair-sized oven. When the oracle had completed itsrevelation, the consultant, usually delirious, was forcibly ejected from thecave, feet foremost.Near the cave of the oracle two fountains bubbled out of the earth within a fewfeet of each other. Those about to enter the cave drank first from thesefountains, the waters of which seemed to possess peculiar occult properties. Thefirst contained the water of forgetfulness, and all who drank thereof forgottheir earthly sorrows. From the second fountain flowed the sacred water ofMnemosyne, or remembrance, for later it enabled those who partook of it torecall their experiences while in the cave.Though its entrance was marked by two brass obelisks, the cave, surrounded by awall of white stones and concealed in the heart of a grove of sacred trees, didnot present an imposing appearance. There is no doubt that those entering itpassed through strange experiences, for they were obliged to leave at theadjacent temple a complete account of what they saw and heard while in theoracle. The prophecies were given in the form of dreams and visions, and wereaccompanied by severe pains in the head; some never completely recovered fromthe after effects of their delirium. The confused recital of their experienceswas interpreted by the priests according to the question to be answered. Whilethe priests probably used some unknown herb to produce the dreams or visions ofthe cavern, their skill in interpreting them bordered on the supernatural.Before consulting the oracle, it was necessary to offer a ram to the daemon ofthe cave, and the priest decided by hieromancy whether the time chosen waspropitious and the sacrifice was satisfactory."},{"pageContent":"THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD Many of the sculptors and architects of the ancient world were initiates of theMysteries, particularly the Eleusinian rites. Since the dawn of time, the truersof stone and the hewers of wood have constituted a divinely overshadowed caste.As civilization spread slowly over the earth, cities were built and deserted;monuments were erected to heroes at present unknown; temples were built to godswho lie broken in the dust of the nations they inspired. Research has proved notonly that the builders of these cities and monuments and the sculptors whochiseled out the inscrutable faces of the gods were masters of their crafts, butthat in the world today there are none to equal them. The profound knowledge ofmathematics and astronomy embodied in ancient architecture, and the equallyprofound knowledge of anatomy revealed in Greek statuary, prove that thefashioners of both were master minds, deeply cultured in the wisdom whichconstituted the arcana of the Mysteries. Thus was established the Guild of theBuilders, progenitors of modern Freemasons. When employed to build palaces,temples or tombs, or to carve statues for the wealthy, those initiatedarchitects and artists concealed in their works the secret doctrine, so thatnow, long after their bones have returned to dust, the world realizes that thosefirst artisans were indeed duly initiated and worthy to receive the wages ofMaster Masons.The Seven Wonders of the World, while apparently designed for diverse reasons,were really monuments erected to perpetuate the arcana of the Mysteries. Theywere symbolic structures, placed in peculiar spots, and the real purpose oftheir erection can be sensed only by the initiated. Eliphas Levi has noted themarked correspondence between these Seven Wonders and the seven planets. TheSeven Wonders of the World were built by Widow’s sons in honor of the sevenplanetary genii. Their secret symbolism is identical with that of the sevenseals of Revelation and the seven churches of Asia.> 1.

When the Pythoness (prophetess of Apollo)seated herself on the golden tripod over the yawning vent of the oracle, she didnot answer the question they had asked, but told Mnesarchus that his wife wasthen with child and would give birth to a son who was destined to surpass allmen in beauty and wisdom, and who throughout the course of his life wouldcontribute much to the benefit of mankind. Mnesarchus was so deeply impressed bythe prophecy that he changed his wife’s name to Pythasis, in honor of thePythian priestess. When the child was born at Sidon in Phœnicia, it was—as theoracle had said—a son. Mnesarchus and Pythasis named the child Pythagoras, forthey believed that he had been predestined by the oracle.Many strange legends have been preserved concerning the birth of Pythagoras.Some maintained that he was no mortal man: that he was one of the gods who hadtaken a human body to enable him to come into the world and instruct the humanrace. Pythagoras was one of the many sages and saviors of antiquity for whom animmaculate conception is asserted. In his Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins writes:“The first striking circumstance in which the history of Pythagoras agrees withthe history of Jesus is, that they were natives of nearly the same country; theformer being born at Sidon, the latter at Bethlehem, both in Syria. The fatherof Pythagoras, as well as the father of Jesus, was prophetically informed thathis wife should bring forth a son, who should be a benefactor to mankind. Theywere both born when their mothers were from home on journeys, Joseph and hiswife having gone up to Bethlehem to be taxed, and the father of Pythagorashaving travelled from Samos, his residence, to Sidon, about his mercantileconcerns. Pythais [Pythasis], the mother of Pythagoras, had a connexion with anApolloniacal spectre, or ghost, of the God Apollo, or God Sol, (of course thismust have been a holy ghost, and here we have the Holy Ghost) which afterwardappeared to her husband, and told him that he must have no connexion with hiswife during her pregnancy—a story evidently the same as that relating to Josephand Mary. From these peculiar circumstances, Pythagoras was known by the sametitle as Jesus, namely, the son of God; and was supposed by the multitude to beunder the influence of Divine inspiration.”This most famous philosopher was born sometime between 600 and 590 B.C., and thelength of his life has been estimated at nearly one hundred years.The teachings of Pythagoras indicate that he was thoroughly conversant with theprecepts of Oriental and Occidental esotericism. He traveled among the Jews andwas instructed by the Rabbins concerning the secret traditions of Moses, thelawgiver of Israel. Later the School of the Essenes was conducted chiefly forthe purpose of interpreting the Pythagorean symbols. Pythagoras was initiatedinto Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chaldean Mysteries. Although it is believed bysome that he was a disciple of Zoroaster, it is doubtful whether his instructorof that name was the God-man now revered by the Parsees. While accounts of histravels differ, historians agree that he visited many countries and studied atthe feet of many masters.“After having acquired all which it was possible for him to learn of the Greekphilosophers and, presumably, become an initiate in the Eleusinian mysteries, hewent to Egypt, and after many rebuffs and refusals, finally succeeded insecuring initiation in the Mysteries of Isis, at the hands of the priests ofThebes. Then this intrepid ‘joiner’ wended his way into Phœnicia and Syria wherethe Mysteries of Adonis were conferred upon him, and crossing to the valley ofthe Euphrates he tarried long enough to become versed in the secret lore of theChaldeans, who still dwelt in the vicinity of Babylon. Finally, he made hisgreatest and most historic venture through Media and Persia into Hindustan wherehe remained several years as a pupil and initiate of the learned Brahmins ofElephanta and Ellora.” (See Ancient Freemasonry, by Frank C. Higgins, 32°.) Thesame author adds that the name of Pythagoras is still preserved in the recordsof the Brahmins as Yavancharya, the Ionian Teacher.Pythagoras was said to have been the first man to call himself a philosopher; infact, the world is indebted to him for the word philosopher. Before that timethe wise men had called themselves sages, which was interpreted to mean thosewho know. Pythagoras was more modest. He coined the word philosopher, which hedefined as one who is attempting to find out.After returning from his wanderings, Pythagoras established a school, or as ithas been sometimes called, a university, at Crotona, a Dorian colony in SouthernItaly. Upon his arrival at Crotona he was regarded askance, but after a shorttime those holding important positions in the surrounding colonies sought hiscounsel in matters of great moment. He gathered around him a small group ofsincere disciples whom he instructed in the secret wisdom which had beenrevealed to him, and also in the fundamentals of occult mathematics, music, andastronomy, which he considered to be the triangular foundation of all the artsand sciences.When he was about sixty years old, Pythagoras married one of his disciples, andseven children resulted from the union. His wife was a remarkably able woman,who not only inspired him during the years of his life but after hisassassination continued to promulgate his doctrines.As is so often the case with genius, Pythagoras by his outspokenness incurredboth political and personal enmity. Among those who came for initiation was onewho, because Pythagoras refused to admit him, determined to destroy both the manand his philosophy. By means of false propaganda, this disgruntled one turnedthe minds of the common people against the philosopher. Without warning, a bandof murderers descended upon the little group of buildings where the greatteacher and his disciples dwelt, burned the structures and killed Pythagoras.Accounts of the philosopher’s death do not agree. Some say that he was murderedwith his disciples; others that, on escaping from Crotona with a small band offollowers, he was trapped and burned alive by his enemies in a little housewhere the band had decided to rest for the night. Another account states that,finding themselves trapped in the burning structure, the disciples threwthemselves into the flames, making of their own bodies a bridge over whichPythagoras escaped, only to die of a broken heart a short time afterwards as theresult of grieving over the apparent fruitlessness of his efforts to serve andilluminate mankind.His surviving disciples attempted to perpetuate his doctrines, but they werepersecuted on every hand and very little remains today as a testimonial to thegreatness of this philosopher. It is said that the disciples of Pythagoras neveraddressed him or referred to him by his own name, but always as The Master orThat Man. This may have been because of the fact that the name Pythagoras wasbelieved to consist of a certain number of specially arranged letters with greatsacred significance. The Word magazine has printed an article by T. R. Prater,showing that Pythagoras initiated his candidates by means of a certain formulaconcealed within the letters of his own name. This may explain why the wordPythagoras was so highly revered.After the death of Pythagoras his school gradually disintegrated, but those whohad benefited by its teachings revered the memory of the great philosopher, asduring his life they had reverenced the man himself. As time went on, Pythagorascame to be regarded as a god rather than a man, and his scattered disciples werebound together by their common admiration for the transcendent genius of theirteacher. Edouard Schure, in his Pythagoras and the Delphic Mysteries, relatesthe following incident as illustrative of the bond of fellowship uniting themembers of the Pythagorean School:“One of them who had fallen upon sickness and poverty was kindly taken in by aninnkeeper. Before dying he traced a few mysterious signs (the pentagram, nodoubt) on the door of the inn and said to the host, ‘Do not be uneasy, one of mybrothers will pay my debts.’ A year afterwards, as a stranger was passing bythis inn he saw the signs and said to the host, ‘I am a Pythagorean; one of mybrothers died here; tell me what I owe you on his account.”’Frank C. Higgins, 32°, gives an excellent compendium of the Pythagorean tenetsin the following outline:“Pythagoras’ teachings are of the most transcendental importance to Masons,inasmuch as they are the necessary fruit of his contact with the leadingphilosophers of the whole civilized world of his own day, and must representthat in which all were agreed, shorn of all weeds of controversy. Thus, thedetermined stand made by Pythagoras, in defense of pure monotheism, issufficient evidence that the tradition to the effect that the unity of God wasthe supreme secret of all the ancient initiations is substantially correct. Thephilosophical school of Pythagoras was, in a measure, also a series ofinitiations, for he caused his pupils to pass through a series of degrees andnever permitted them personal contact with himself until they had reached thehigher grades. According to his biographers, his degrees were three in number.The first, that of ‘Mathematicus,’ assuring his pupils proficiency inmathematics and geometry, which was then, as it would be now if Masonry wereproperly inculcated, the basis upon which all other knowledge was erected.Secondly, the degree of ‘Theoreticus,’ which dealt with superficial applicationsof the exact sciences, and, lastly, the degree of ‘Electus,’ which entitled thecandidate to pass forward into the light of the fullest illumination which hewas capable of absorbing. The pupils of the Pythagorean school were divided into‘exoterici,’ or pupils in the outer grades, and ‘esoterici,’ after they hadpassed the third degree of initiation and were entitled to the secret wisdom.Silence, secrecy and unconditional obedience were cardinal principles of thisgreat order.” (See Ancient Freemasonry.)"},{"pageContent":"PYTHAGORIC FUNDAMENTALS The study of geometry, music, and astronomy was considered essential to arational understanding of God, man, or Nature, and no one could accompanyPythagoras as a disciple who was not thoroughly familiar with these sciences.Many came seeking admission to his school. Each applicant was tested on thesethree subjects, and if found ignorant, was summarily dismissed.Pythagoras was not an extremist. He taught moderation in all things rather thanexcess in anything, for he believed that an excess of virtue was in itself avice. One of his favorite statements was: “We must avoid with our utmostendeavor, and amputate with fire and sword, and by all other means, from thebody, sickness; from the soul, ignorance; from the belly, luxury; from a city,sedition; from a family, discord; and from all things, excess.” Pythagoras alsobelieved that there was no crime equal to that of anarchy.All men know what they want, but few know what they need. Pythagoras warned hisdisciples that when they prayed they should not pray for themselves; that whenthey asked things of the gods they should not ask things for themselves, becauseno man knows what is good for him and it is for this reason undesirable to askfor things which, if obtained, would only prove to be injurious.The God of Pythagoras was the Monad, or the One that is Everything. He describedGod as the Supreme Mind distributed throughout all parts of the universe—theCause of all things, the Intelligence of all things, and the Power within allthings. He further declared the motion of God to be circular, the body of God tobe composed of the substance of light, and the nature of God to be composed ofthe substance of truth.041 [images/00042.jpg] THE SYMMETRICAL GEOMETRIC SOLIDS.To the five symmetrical solids of the ancients is added the sphere (1), the mostperfect of all created forms. The five Pythagorean solids are: the tetrahedron(2) with four equilateral triangles as faces; the cube (3) with six squares asfaces; the octahedron (4) with eight equilateral triangles as faces; theicosahedron (5) with twenty equilateral triangles as faces; and the dodecahedron(6) with twelve regular pentagons as faces. Pythagoras declared that the eating of meat clouded the reasoning faculties.While he did not condemn its use or totally abstain therefrom himself, hedeclared that judges should refrain from eating meat before a trial, in orderthat those who appeared before them might receive the most honest and astutedecisions. When Pythagoras decided (as he often did) to retire into the templeof God for an extended period of time to meditate and pray, he took with him asupply of specially prepared food and drink. The food consisted of equal partsof the seeds of poppy and sesame, the skin of the sea onion from which the juicehad been thoroughly extracted, the flower of daffodil, the leaves of mallows,and a paste of barley and peas. These he compounded together with the additionof wild honey. For a beverage he took the seeds of cucumbers, dried raisins(with seeds removed), the flowers of coriander, the seeds of mallows andpurslane, scraped cheese, meal, and cream, mixed together and sweetened withwild honey. Pythagoras claimed that this was the diet of Hercules whilewandering in the Libyan desert and was according to the formula given to thathero by the goddess Ceres herself.The favorite method of healing among the Pythagoreans was by the aid ofpoultices. These people also knew the magic properties of vast numbers ofplants. Pythagoras highly esteemed the medicinal properties of the sea onion,and he is said to have written an entire volume on the subject. Such a work,however, is not known at the present time. Pythagoras discovered that music hadgreat therapeutic power and he prepared special harmonies for various diseases.He apparently experimented also with color, attaining considerable success. Oneof his unique curative processes resulted from his discovery of the healingvalue of certain verses from the Odyssey and the Iliad of Homer. These he causedto be read to persons suffering from certain ailments. He was opposed to surgeryin all its forms and also objected to cauterizing. He would not permit thedisfigurement of the human body, for such, in his estimation, was a sacrilegeagainst the dwelling place of the gods.Pythagoras taught that friendship was the truest and nearest perfect of allrelationships. He declared that in Nature there was a friendship of all for all;of gods for men; of doctrines one for another; of the soul for the body; of therational part for the irrational part; of philosophy for its theory; of men forone another; of countrymen for one another; that friendship also existed betweenstrangers, between a man and his wife, his children, and his servants. All bondswithout friendship were shackles, and there was no virtue in their maintenance.Pythagoras believed that relationships were essentially mental rather thanphysical, and that a stranger of sympathetic intellect was closer to him than ablood relation whose viewpoint was at variance with his own. Pythagoras definedknowledge as the fruitage of mental accumulation. He believed that it would beobtained in many ways, but principally through observation. Wisdom was theunderstanding of the source or cause of all things, and this could be securedonly by raising the intellect to a point where it intuitively cognized theinvisible manifesting outwardly through the visible, and thus became capable ofbringing itself en rapport with the spirit of things rather than with theirforms. The ultimate source that wisdom could cognize was the Monad, themysterious permanent atom of the Pythagoreans.Pythagoras taught that both man and the universe were made in the image of God;that both being made in the same image, the understanding of one predicated theknowledge of the other. He further taught that there was a constant interplaybetween the Grand Man (the universe) and man (the little universe).Pythagoras believed that all the sidereal bodies were alive and that the formsof the planets and stars were merely bodies encasing souls, minds, and spiritsin the same manner that the visible human form is but the encasing vehicle foran invisible spiritual organism which is, in reality, the conscious individual.Pythagoras regarded the planets as magnificent deities, worthy of the adorationand respect of man. All these deities, however, he considered subservient to theOne First Cause within whom they all existed temporarily, as mortality exists inthe midst of immortality.The famous Pythagorean Y signified the power of choice and was used in theMysteries as emblematic of the Forking of the Ways. The central stem separatedinto two parts, one branching to the right and the other to the left. The branchto the right was called Divine Wisdom and the one to the left Earthly Wisdom.Youth, personified by the candidate, walking the Path of Life, symbolized by thecentral stem of the Y, reaches the point where the Path divides. The neophytemust then choose whether he will take the left-hand path and, following thedictates of his lower nature, enter upon a span of folly and thoughtlessnesswhich will inevitably result in his undoing, or whether he will take theright-hand road and through integrity, industry, and sincerity ultimately regainunion with the immortals in the superior spheres.It is probable that Pythagoras obtained his concept of the Y from the Egyptians,who included in certain of their initiatory rituals a scene in which thecandidate was confronted by two female figures. One of them, veiled with thewhite robes of the temple, urged the neophyte to enter into the halls oflearning; the other, bedecked with jewels, symbolizing earthly treasures, andbearing in her hands a tray loaded with grapes (emblematic of false light),sought to lure him into the chambers of dissipation. This symbol is stillpreserved among the Tarot cards, where it is called The Forking of the Ways. Theforked stick has been the symbol of life among many nations, and it was placedin the desert to indicate the presence of water.Concerning the theory of transmigration as disseminated by Pythagoras, there aredifferences of opinion. According to one view, he taught that mortals who duringtheir earthly existence had by their actions become like certain animals,returned to earth again in the form of the beasts which they had grown toresemble. Thus, a timid person would return in the form of a rabbit or a deer; acruel person in the form of a wolf or other ferocious animal; and a cunningperson in the guise of a fox. This concept, however, does not fit into thegeneral Pythagorean scheme, and it is far more likely that it was given in anallegorical rather than a literal sense. It was intended to convey the idea thathuman beings become bestial when they allow themselves to be dominated by theirown lower desires and destructive tendencies. It is probable that the termtransmigration is to be understood as what is more commonly calledreincarnation, a doctrine which Pythagoras must have contacted directly orindirectly in India and Egypt.The fact that Pythagoras accepted the theory of successive reappearances of thespiritual nature in human form is found in a footnote to Levi’s History ofMagic: “He was an important champion of what used to be called the doctrine ofmetempsychosis, understood as the soul’s transmigration into successive bodies.He himself had been (a) Aethalides, a son of Mercury; (b) Euphorbus, son ofPanthus, who perished at the hands of Menelaus in the Trojan war; (c)Hermotimus, a prophet of Clazomenae, a city of Ionia; (d) a humble fisherman;and finally (e) the philosopher of Samos.”Pythagoras also taught that each species of creatures had what he termed a seal,given to it by God, and that the physical form of each was the impression ofthis seal upon the wax of physical substance. Thus each body was stamped withthe dignity of its divinely given pattern. Pythagoras believed that ultimatelyman would reach a state where he would cast off his gross nature and function ina body of spiritualized ether which would be in juxtaposition to his physicalform at all times and which might be the eighth sphere, or Antichthon. From thishe would ascend into the realm of the immortals, where by divine birthright hebelonged.Pythagoras taught that everything in nature was divisible into three parts andthat no one could become truly wise who did not view every problem as beingdiagrammatically triangular. He said, “Establish the triangle and the problem istwo-thirds solved”; further, “All things consist of three.” In conformity withthis viewpoint, Pythagoras divided the universe into three parts, which hecalled the Supreme World, the Superior World, and the Inferior World. Thehighest, or Supreme World, was a subtle, interpenetrative spiritual essencepervading all things and therefore the true plane of the Supreme Deity itself,the Deity being in every sense omnipresent, omniactive, omnipotent, andomniscient. Both of the lower worlds existed within the nature of this supremesphere.The Superior World was the home of the immortals. It was also the dwelling placeof the archetypes, or the seals; their natures in no manner partook of thematerial of earthiness, but they, casting their shadows upon the deep (theInferior World), were cognizable only through their shadows. The third, orInferior World, was the home of those creatures who partook of materialsubstance or were engaged in labor with or upon material substance. Hence, thissphere was the home of the mortal gods, the Demiurgi, the angels who labor withmen; also the dæmons who partake of the nature of the earth; and finally mankindand the lower kingdoms, those temporarily of the earth but capable of risingabove that sphere by reason and philosophy.The digits 1 and 2 are not considered numbers by the Pythagoreans, because theytypify the two supermundane spheres. The Pythagorean numbers, therefore, beginwith 3, the triangle, and 4, the square. These added to the 1 and the 2, producethe 10, the great number of all things, the archetype of the universe. The threeworlds were called receptacles. The first was the receptacle of principles, thesecond was the receptacle of intelligences, and the third, or lowest, was thereceptacle of quantities.“The symmetrical solids were regarded by Pythagoras, and by the Greek thinkersafter him, as of the greatest importance. To be perfectly symmetrical orregular, a solid must have an equal number of faces meeting at each of itsangles, and these faces must be equal regular polygons, i. e., figures whosesides and angles are all equal. Pythagoras, perhaps, may be credited with thegreat discovery that there are only five such solids. * * *“Now, the Greeks believed the world [material universe] to be composed of fourelements—earth, air, fire, water—and to the Greek mind the conclusion wasinevitable that the shapes of the particles of the elements were those of theregular solids. Earth-particles were cubical, the cube being the regular solidpossessed of greatest stability; fire-particles were tetrahedral, thetetrahedron being the simplest and, hence, lightest solid. Water-particles wereicosahedral for exactly the reverse reason, wilst air-particles, as intermediatebetween the two latter, were octahedral. The dodecahedron was, to these ancientmathematicians, the most mysterious of the solids; it was by far the mostdifficult to construct, the accurate drawing of the regular pentagonnecessitating a rather elaborate application of Pythagoras’ great theorem. Hencethe conclusion, as Plato put it, that ‘this (the regular dodecahedron) the Deityemployed in tracing the plan of the Universe.’” (H. Stanley Redgrove, in BygoneBeliefs.)Mr. Redgrove has not mentioned the fifth element of the ancient Mysteries, thatwhich would make the analogy between the symmetrical solids and the elementscomplete. This fifth element, or ether, was called by the Hindus akasa. It wasclosely correlated with the hypothetical ether of modern science, and was theinterpenetrative substance permeating all of the other elements and acting as acommon solvent and common denominator of them. The twelve-faced solid alsosubtly referred to the Twelve Immortals who surfaced the universe, and also tothe twelve convolutions of the human brain—the vehicles of those Immortals inthe nature of man.While Pythagoras, in accordance with others of his day, practiced divination(possibly arithmomancy), there is no accurate information concerning the methodswhich he used. He is believed to have had a remarkable wheel by means of whichhe could predict future events, and to have learned hydromancy from theEgyptians. He believed that brass had oracular powers, because even wheneverything was perfectly still there was always a rumbling sound in brass bowls.He once addressed a prayer to the spirit of a river and out of the water arose avoice, “Pythagoras, I greet thee.” It is claimed for him that he was able tocause daemons to enter into water and disturb its surface, and by means of theagitations certain things were predicted.After having drunk from a certain spring one day, one of the Masters ofPythagoras announced that the spirit of the water had just predicted that agreat earthquake would occur the next day—a prophecy which was fulfilled. It ishighly probable that Pythagoras possessed hypnotic power, not only over man butalso over animals. He caused a bird to change the course of its flight, a bearto cease its ravages upon a community, and a bull to change its diet, by theexercise of mental influence. He was also gifted with second sight, being ableto see things at a distance and accurately describe incidents that had not yetcome to pass."},{"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC APHORISMS OF PYTHAGORAS Iamblichus gathered thirty-nine of the symbolic sayings of Pythagoras andinterpreted them.

The most famous of the Pythagorean fragments are the Golden Verses, ascribed toPythagoras himself, but concerning whose authorship there is an element ofdoubt. The Golden Verses contain a brief summary of the entire system ofphilosophy forming the basis of the educational doctrines of Crotona, or, as itis more commonly known, the Italic School. These verses open by counseling thereader to love God, venerate the great heroes, and respect the dæmons andelemental inhabitants. They then urge man to think carefully and industriouslyconcerning his daily life, and to prefer the treasures of the mind and soul toaccumulations of earthly goods. The verses also promise man that if he will riseabove his lower material nature and cultivate self-control, he will ultimatelybe acceptable in the sight of the gods, be reunited with them, and partake oftheir immortality. (It is rather significant to note that Plato paid a greatprice for some of the manuscripts of Pythagoras which had been saved from thedestruction of Crotona. See Historia Deorum Fatidicorum, Geneva, 1675.)"},{"pageContent":"PYTHAGOREAN ASTRONOMY According to Pythagoras, the position of each body in the universe wasdetermined by the essential dignity of that body. The popular concept of his daywas that the earth occupied the center of the solar system; that the planets,including the sun and moon, moved about the earth; and that the earth itself wasflat and square. Contrary to this concept, and regardless of criticism,Pythagoras declared that fire was the most important of all the elements; thatthe center was the most important part of every body; and that, just as Vesta’sfire was in the midst of every home, so in the midst of the universe was aflaming sphere of celestial radiance. This central globe he called the Tower ofJupiter, the Globe of Unity, the Grand Monad, and the Altar of Vesta. As thesacred number 10 symbolized the sum of all parts and the completeness of allthings, it was only natural for Pythagoras to divide the universe into tenspheres, symbolized by ten concentric circles. These circles began at the centerwith the globe of Divine Fire; then came the seven planets, the earth, andanother mysterious planet, called Antichthon, which was never visible.Opinions differ as to the nature of Antichthon. Clement of Alexandria believedthat it represented the mass of the heavens; others held the opinion that it wasthe moon. More probably it was the mysterious eighth sphere of the ancients, thedark planet which moved in the same orbit as the earth but which was alwaysconcealed from the earth by the body of the sun, being in exact opposition tothe earth at all times. Is this the mysterious Lilith concerning whichastrologers have speculated so long?Isaac Myer has stated: “The Pythagoreans held that each star was a world havingits own atmosphere, with an immense extent surrounding it, of aether.” (See TheQabbalah.) The disciples of Pythagoras also highly revered the planet Venus,because it was the only planet bright enough to cast a shadow. As the morningstar, Venus is visible before sunrise, and as the evening star it shines forthimmediately after sunset. Because of these qualities, a number of names havebeen given to it by the ancients. Being visible in the sky at sunset, it wascalled vesper, and as it arose before the sun, it was called the false light,the star of the morning, or Lucifer, which means the light-bearer. Because ofthis relation to the sun, the planet was also referred to as Venus, Astarte,Aphrodite, Isis, and The Mother of the Gods. It is possible that at some seasonsof the year in certain latitudes the fact that Venus was a crescent could bedetected without the aid of a telescope. This would account for the crescentwhich is often seen in connection with the goddesses of antiquity, the storiesof which do not agree with the phases of the moon. The accurate knowledge whichPythagoras possessed concerning astronomy he undoubtedly secured in the Egyptiantemples, for their priests understood the true relationship of the heavenlybodies many thousands of years before that knowledge was revealed to theuninitiated world. The fact that the knowledge he acquired in the templesenabled him to make assertions requiring two thousand years to check proves whyPlato and Aristotle so highly esteemed the profundity of the ancient Mysteries.In the midst of comparative scientific ignorance, and without the aid of anymodern instruments, the priest-philosophers had discovered the true fundamentalsof universal dynamics.An interesting application of the Pythagorean doctrine of geometric solids asexpounded by Plato is found in The Canon. “Nearly all the old philosophers,”says its anonymous author, “devised an harmonic theory with respect to theuniverse, and the practice continued till the old mode of philosophizing diedout. Kepler (1596), in order to demonstrate the Platonic doctrine, that theuniverse was formed of the five regular solids, proposed the following rule.‘The earth is a circle, the measurer of all. Round it describe a dodecahedron;the circle inclosing this will be Mars. Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; thesphere inclosing this will be Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter; the spherecontaining this will be Saturn. Now inscribe in the earth an icosahedron; thecircle inscribed in it will be Venus. Inscribe an octahedron in Venus; thecircle inscribed in it will be Mercury’ (Mysterium Cosmographicum, 1596). Thisrule cannot be taken seriously as a real statement of the proportions of thecosmos, for it bears no real resemblance to the ratios published by Copernicusin the beginning of the sixteenth century. Yet Kepler was very proud of hisformula, and said he valued it more than the Electorate of Saxony. It was alsoapproved by those two eminent authorities, Tycho and Galileo, who evidentlyunderstood it. Kepler himself never gives the least hint of how his preciousrule is to be interpreted.” Platonic astronomy was not concerned with thematerial constitution or arrangement of the heavenly bodies, but considered thestars and planets primarily as focal points of Divine intelligence. Physicalastronomy was regarded as the science of “shadows,” philosophical astronomy thescience of “realities.”"},{"pageContent":"XIV Pythagorean Mathematics Concerning the secret significance of numbers there has been much speculation.Though many interesting discoveries have been made, it may be safely said thatwith the death of Pythagoras the great key to this science was lost. For nearly2500 years philosophers of all nations have attempted to unravel the Pythagoreanskein, but apparently none has been successful. Notwithstanding attempts made toobliterate all records of the teachings of Pythagoras, fragments have survivedwhich give clues to some of the simpler parts of his philosophy. The majorsecrets were never committed to writing, but were communicated orally to a fewchosen disciples. These apparently dared not divulge their secrets to theprofane, the result being that when death sealed their lips the arcana died withthem.Certain of the secret schools in the world today are perpetuations of theancient Mysteries, and although it is quite possible that they may possess someof the original numerical formulae, there is no evidence of it in the voluminouswritings which have issued from these groups during the last five hundred years.These writings, while frequently discussing Pythagoras, show no indication of amore complete knowledge of his intricate doctrines than the post-PythagoreanGreek speculators had, who talked much, wrote little, knew less, and concealedtheir ignorance under a series of mysterious hints and promises. Here and thereamong the literary products of early writers are found enigmatic statementswhich they made no effort to interpret. The following example is quoted fromPlutarch:“The Pythagoreans indeed go farther than this, and honour even numbers andgeometrical diagrams with the names and titles of the gods. Thus they call theequilateral triangle head-born Minerva and Tritogenia, because it may be equallydivided by three perpendiculars drawn from each of the angles. So the unit theyterm Apollo, as to the number two they have affixed the name of strife andaudaciousness, and to that of three, justice. For, as doing an injury is anextreme on the one side, and suffering one is an extreme on the other, justiceproperly takes place in the middle between them. In like manner the numberthirty-six, their Tetraktys, or sacred Quater- nion, being composed of the firstfour odd numbers added to the first four even ones, as is commonly reported, islooked upon by them as the most solemn oath they can take, and called Kosmos.”(Isis and Osiris.)Earlier in the same work, Plutarch also notes: “For as the power of the triangleis expressive of the nature of Pluto, Bacchus, and Mars; and the properties ofthe square of Rhea, Venus, Ceres, Vesta, and Juno; of the Dodecahedron ofJupiter; so, as we are informed by Eudoxus, is the figure of fifty-six anglesexpressive of the nature of Typhon.” Plutarch did not pretend to explain theinner significance of the symbols, but believed that the relationship whichPythagoras established between the geometrical solids and the gods was theresult of images the great sage had seen in the Egyptian temples.Albert Pike, the great Masonic symbolist, admitted that there were many pointsconcerning which he could secure no reliable information. In his Symbolism, forthe 32° and 33°, he wrote: “I do not understand why the 7 should be calledMinerva, or the cube, Neptune.” Further on he added: “Undoubtedly the namesgiven by the Pythagoreans to the different numbers were themselves enigmaticaland symbolic—and there is little doubt that in the time of Plutarch the meaningsthese names concealed were lost. Pythagoras had succeeded too well in concealinghis symbols with a veil that was from the first impenetrable, without his oralexplanation * * *.”045 [images/00046.jpg] THE NUMERICAL VALUES OFTHE HEBREW, GREEK, ANDSAMARITAN ALPHABETS.Column> 1.

This uncertainty shared by all true students of the subject proves conclusivelythat it is unwise to make definite statements founded on the indefinite andfragmentary information available concerning the Pythagorean system ofmathematical philosophy. The material which follows represents an effort tocollect a few salient points from the scattered records preserved by disciplesof Pythagoras and others who have since contacted his philosophy."},{"pageContent":"METHOD OF SECURING THE NUMERICAL POWER OF WORDS The first step in obtaining the numerical value of a word is to resolve it backinto its original tongue. Only words of Greek or Hebrew derivation can besuccessfully analyzed by this method, and all words must be spelled in theirmost ancient and complete forms. Old Testament words and names, therefore, mustbe translated back into the early Hebrew characters and New Testament words intothe Greek. Two examples will help to clarify this principle.The Demiurgus of the Jews is called in English Jehovah, but when seeking thenumerical value of the name Jehovah it is necessary to resolve the name into itsHebrew letters. It becomes046 [images/00047.jpg]and is read from right to left.The Hebrew letters are:047 [images/00048.jpg]He; 048 [images/00049.jpg]Vau; 049[images/00050.jpg]He;050 [images/00051.jpg]Yod; and when reversed into theEnglish order from left to right read: Yod-He-Vau-He. By consulting theforegoing table of letter values, it is found that the four characters of thissacred name have the following numerical significance: Yod equals 10. He equals5, Vau equals 6, and the second He equals 5. Therefore, 10 + 5 + 6 + 5=26, asynonym of Jehovah. If the English letters were used, the answer obviously wouldnot be correct.The second example is the mysterious Gnostic pantheos Abraxas. For this name theGreek table is used. Abraxas in Greek is ’Aβραξας. A = 1, β = 2, p = 100, α = 1,ξ = 60, α = 1, ς = 200, the sum being 365, the number of days in the year. Thisnumber furnishes the key to the mystery of Abraxas, who is symbolic of the 365Æons, or Spirits of the Days, gathered together in one composite personality.Abraxas is symbolic of five creatures, and as the circle of the year actuallyconsists of 360 degrees, each of the emanating deities is one-fifth of thispower, or 72, one of the most sacred numbers in the Old Testament of the Jewsand in their Qabbalistic system. This same method is used in finding thenumerical value of the names of the gods and goddesses of the Greeks and Jews.All higher numbers can be reduced to one of the original ten numerals, and the10 itself to 1. Therefore, all groups of numbers resulting from the translationof names of deities into their numerical equivalents have a basis in one of thefirst ten numbers. By this system, in which the digits are added together, 666becomes 6 + 6 + 6 or 18, and this, in turn, becomes 1 + 8 or 9. According toRevelation, 144,000 are to be saved. This number becomes 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0,which equals 9, thus proving that both the Beast of Babylon and the number ofthe saved refer to man himself, whose symbol is the number 9. This system can beused successfully with both Greek and Hebrew letter values.The original Pythagorean system of numerical philosophy contains nothing tojustify the practice now in vogue of changing the given name or surname in thehope of improving the temperament or financial condition by altering the namevibrations.There is also a system of calculation in vogue for the English language, but itsaccuracy is a matter of legitimate dispute. It is comparatively modern and hasno relationship either to the Hebrew Qabbalistic system or to the Greekprocedure. The claim made by some that it is Pythagorean is not supported by anytangible evidence, and there are many reasons why such a contention isuntenable. The fact that Pythagoras used 10 as the basis of calculation, whilethis system uses 9—an imperfect number—is in itself almost conclusive.Furthermore, the arrangement of the Greek and Hebrew letters does not agreeclosely enough with the English to permit the application of the numbersequences of one language to the number sequences of the others. Furtherexperimentation with the system may prove profitable, but it is without basis inantiquity. The arrangement of the letters and numbers is as follows:051 [images/00052.jpg] The letters under each of the numbers have the value of the figure at the top ofthe column. Thus, in the word man, M = 4, A = 1, N = 5 : a total of 10. Thevalues of the numbers are practically the same as those given by the Pythagoreansystem."},{"pageContent":"AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PYHTAGOREAN THEORY OF NUMBERS (The following outline of Pythagorean mathematics is a paraphrase of the openingchapters of Thomas Taylor’s Theoretic Arithmetic, the rarest and most importantcompilation of Pythagorean mathematical fragments extant.)The Pythagoreans declared arithmetic to be the mother of the mathematicalsciences. This is proved by the fact that geometry, music, and astronomy aredependent upon it but it is not dependent upon them. Thus, geometry may beremoved but arithmetic will remain; but if arithmetic be removed, geometry iseliminated. In the same manner music depends upon arithmetic, but theelimination of music affects arithmetic only by limiting one of its expressions.The Pythagoreans also demonstrated arithmetic to be prior to astronomy, for thelatter is dependent upon both geometry and music. The size, form, and motion ofthe celestial bodies is determined by the use of geometry; their harmony andrhythm by the use of music. If astronomy be removed, neither geometry nor musicis injured; but if geometry and music be eliminated, astronomy is destroyed. Thepriority of both geometry and music to astronomy is therefore established.Arithmetic, however, is prior to all; it is primary and fundamental.Pythagoras instructed his disciples that the science of mathematics is dividedinto two major parts. The first is concerned with the multitude, or theconstituent parts of a thing, and the second with the magnitude, or the relativesize or density of a thing.Magnitude is divided into two parts—magnitude which is stationary and magnitudewhich is movable, the stationary part having priority. Multitude is also dividedinto two parts, for it is related both to itself and to other things, the firstrelationship having priority. Pythagoras assigned the science of arithmetic tomultitude related to itself, and the art of music to multitude related to otherthings. Geometry likewise was assigned to stationary magnitude, and spherics(used partly in the sense of astronomy) to movable magnitude. Both multitude andmagnitude were circumscribed by the circumference of mind. The atomic theory hasproved size to be the result of number, for a mass is made up of minute unitsthough mistaken by the uninformed for a single simple substance.Owing to the fragmentary condition of existing Pythagorean records, it isdifficult to arrive at exact definitions of terms. Before it is possible,however, to unfold the subject further some light must be cast upon the meaningsof the words number, monad, and one.The monad signifies (a) the all-including ONE. The Pythagoreans called the monadthe “noble number, Sire of Gods and men.” The monad also signifies (b) the sumof any combination of numbers considered as a whole. Thus, the universe isconsidered as a monad, but the individual parts of the universe (such as theplanets and elements) are monads in relation to the parts of which theythemselves are composed, though they, in turn, are parts of the greater monadformed of their sum. The monad may also be likened (c) to the seed of a treewhich, when it has grown, has many branches (the numbers). In other words, thenumbers are to the monad what the branches of the tree are to the seed of thetree. From the study of the mysterious Pythagorean monad, Leibnitz evolved hismagnificent theory of the world atoms—a theory in perfect accord with theancient teachings of the Mysteries, for Leibnitz himself was an initiate of asecret school. By some Pythagoreans the monad is also considered (d) synonymouswith the one.Number is the term applied to all numerals and their combinations. (A strictinterpretation of the term number by certain of the Pythagorean excludes 1 and2.) Pythagoras defines number to be the extension and energy of the spermaticreasons contained in the monad. The followers of Hippasus declared number to bethe first pattern used by the Demiurgus in the formation of the universe.The one was defined by the Platonists as “the summit of the many.” The onediffers from the monad in that the term monad is used to designate the sum ofthe parts considered as a unit, whereas the one is the term applied to each ofits integral parts.There are two orders of number: odd and even. Because unity, or 1, alwaysremains indivisible, the odd number cannot be divided equally. Thus, 9 is 4 + 1+ 4, the unity in the center being indivisible. Furthermore, if any odd numberbe divided into two parts, one part will always be odd and the other even. Thus,9 may be 5 + 4, 3 + 6, 7 + 2, or 8 + 1. The Pythagoreans considered the oddnumber—of which the monad was the prototype—to be definite and masculine. Theywere not all agreed, however, as to the nature of unity, or 1. Some declared itto be positive, because if added to an even (negative) number, it produces anodd (positive) number. Others demonstrated that if unity be added to an oddnumber, the latter becomes even, thereby making the masculine to be feminine.Unity, or 1, therefore, was considered an androgynous number, partaking of boththe masculine and the feminine attributes; consequently both odd and even. Forthis reason the Pythagoreans called it evenly-odd. It was customary for thePythagoreans to offer sacrifices of an uneven number of objects to the superiorgods, while to the goddesses and subterranean spirits an even number wasoffered.Any even number may be divided into two equal parts, which are always eitherboth odd or both even. Thus, 10 by equal division gives 5 + 5, both odd numbers.The same principle holds true if the 10 be unequally divided. For example, in 6+ 4, both parts are even; in 7 + 3, both parts are odd; in 8 + 2, both parts areagain even; and in 9 + 1, both parts are again odd. Thus, in the even number,however it may be divided, the parts will always be both odd or both even. ThePythagoreans considered the even number—of which the duad was the prototype—tobe indefinite and feminine.The odd numbers are divided by a mathematical contrivance—called “the Sieve ofEratosthenes”—into three general classes: incomposite, composite, andincomposite-composite.The incomposite numbers are those which have no divisor other than themselvesand unity, such as 3, 5, 7,11,13,17,19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and soforth. For example, 7 is divisible only by 7, which goes into itself once, andunity, which goes into 7 seven times.The composite numbers are those which are divisible not only by themselves andunity but also by some other number, such as 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51,57, and so forth. For example, 21 is divisible not only by itself and by unity,but also by 3 and by 7.The incomposite-composite numbers are those which have no common divisor,although each of itself is capable of division, such as 9 and 25. For example, 9is divisible by 3 and 25 by 5, but neither is divisible by the divisor of theother; thus they have no common divisor. Because they have individual divisors,they are called composite; and because they have no common divisor, they arecalled incomposite. Accordingly, the term incomposite-composite was created todescribe their properties.Even numbers are divided into three classes: evenly-even, evenly-odd, andoddly-odd.The evenly-even numbers are all in duple ratio from unity; thus: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1,024. The proof of the perfect evenly-even number isthat it can be halved and the halves again halved back to unity, as ½ of 64=32;½ of 32=16; ½ of 16=8; ½ of 8=4; ½ of 4=2; ½ of 2=1; beyond unity it isimpossible to go.The evenly-even numbers possess certain unique properties. The sum of any numberof terms but the last term is always equal to the last term minus one. Forexample: the sum of the first and second terms ( 1 + 2) equals the third term(4) minus one; or, the sum of the first, second, third, and fourth terms (1 + 2+ 4+8) equals the fifth term (16) minus one.In a series of evenly-even numbers, the first multiplied by the last equals thelast; the second multiplied by the second from the last equals the last, and soon until in an odd series one number remains, which multiplied by itself equalsthe last number of the series; or, in an even series two numbers remain, whichmultiplied by each other give the last number of the series. For example: 1, 2,4, 8, 16 is an odd series. The first number (1) multiplied by the last number(16) equals the last number (16). The second number (2) multiplied by the secondfrom the last number (8) equals the last number (16). Being an odd series, the 4is left in the center, and this multiplied by itself also equals the last number(16).The evenly-odd numbers are those which, when halved, are incapable of furtherdivision by halving. They are formed by taking the odd numbers in sequentialorder and multiplying them by 2. By this process the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,11 produce the evenly-odd numbers 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22. Thus, every fourthnumber is evenly-odd. Each of the even-odd numbers may be divided once, as 2,which becomes two 1’s and cannot be divided further; or 6, which becomes two 3’sand cannot be divided further.Another peculiarity of the evenly-odd numbers is that if the divisor be odd thequotient is always even, and if the divisor be even the quotient is always odd.For example: if 18 be divided by 2 (an even divisor) the quotient is 9 (an oddnumber); if 18 be divided by 3 (an odd divisor) the quotient is 6 (an evennumber).The evenly-odd numbers are also remarkable in that each term is one-half of thesum of the terms on either side of it. For example: 10 is one-half of the sum of6 and 14; 18 is one-half the sum of 14 and 22; and 6 is one-half the sum of 2and 10.The oddly-odd, or unevenly-even, numbers are a compromise between theevenly-even and the evenly-odd numbers. Unlike the evenly-even, they cannot behalved back to unity; and unlike the evenly-odd, they are capable of more thanone division by halving. The oddly-odd numbers are formed by multiplying theevenly-even numbers above 2 by the odd numbers above one. The odd numbers aboveone are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so forth. The evenly-even numbers above 2 are 4, 8,16, 32, 64 and so on. The first odd number of the series (3) multiplied by 4(the first evenly-even number of the series) gives 12, the first oddly-oddnumber. By multiplying 5, 7, 9, 11, and so forth, by 4, oddly-odd numbers arefound. The other oddly-odd numbers are produced by multiplying 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,and so forth, in turn, by the other evenly-even numbers (8, 16, 32, 64, and soforth). An example of the halving of the oddly-odd number is as follows: ½ of 12= 6; ½ of 6 = 3, which cannot be halved further because the Pythagoreans did notdivide unity.Even numbers are also divided into three other classes: superperfect, deficient,and perfect.Superperfect or superabundant numbers are such as have the sum of theirfractional parts greater than themselves. For example: ½ of 24 = 12; ¼ = 6;052[images/00053.jpg]= 8;053 [images/00054.jpg]= 4;054 [images/00055.jpg]= 2;and055 [images/00056.jpg]= 1. The sum of these parts (12+6+8+4+2+1) is 33, whichis in excess of 24, the original number.Deficient numbers are such as have the sum of their fractional parts less thanthemselves. For example: ½ of 14=7;056 [images/00057.jpg]= 2; and057[images/00058.jpg]= 1. The sum of these parts (7 + 2 + 1) is 10, which is lessthan 14, the original number.Perfect numbers are such as have the sum of their fractional parts equal tothemselves. For example: ½ of 28 = 14;¼ = 7;058 [images/00059.jpg]= 4;059[images/00060.jpg]= 2; and060 [images/00061.jpg]= 1. The sum of these parts (14+ 7 + 4 + 2 + 1) is equal to 28.The perfect numbers are extremely rare. There is only one between 1 and 10,namely, 6; one between 10 and 100, namely, 28; one between 100 and 1,000,namely, 496; and one between 1,000 and 10,000, namely, 8,128. The perfectnumbers are found by the following rule: The first number of the evenly-evenseries of numbers (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so forth) is added to the secondnumber of the series, and if an incomposite number results it is multiplied bythe last number of the series of evenly-even numbers whose sum produced it. Theproduct is the first perfect number. For example: the first and secondevenly-even numbers are 1 and 2. Their sum is 3, an incomposite number. If 3 bemultiplied by 2, the last number of the series of evenly-even numbers used toproduce it, the product is 6, the first perfect number. If the addition of theevenly-even numbers does not result in an incomposite number, the nextevenly-even number of the series must be added until an incomposite numberresults. The second perfect number is found in the following manner: The sum ofthe evenly-even numbers 1, 2, and 4 is 7, an incomposite number. If 7 bemultiplied by 4 (the last of the series of evenly-even numbers used to produceit) the product is 28, the second perfect number. This method of calculation maybe continued to infinity.Perfect numbers when multiplied by 2 produce superabundant numbers, and whendivided by 2 produce deficient numbers.The Pythagoreans evolved their philosophy from the science of numbers. Thefollowing quotation from Theoretic Arithmetic is an excellent example of thispractice:“Perfect numbers, therefore, are beautiful images of the virtues which arecertain media between excess and defect, and are not summits, as by some of theancients they were supposed to be. And evil indeed is opposed to evil, but bothare opposed to one good. Good, however, is never opposed to good, but to twoevils at one and the same time. Thus timidity is opposed to audacity, to both[of] which the want of true courage is common; but both timidity and audacityare opposed to fortitude. Craft also is opposed to fatuity, to both [of] whichthe want of intellect is common; and both these are opposed to prudence. Thus,too, profusion is opposed to avarice, to both [of] which illiberality is common;and both these are opposed to liberality. And in a similar manner in the othervirtues; by all [of] which it is evident that perfect numbers have a greatsimilitude to the virtues. But they also resemble the virtues on anotheraccount; for they are rarely found, as being few, and they are generated in avery constant order. On the contrary, an infinite multitude of superabundant anddiminished numbers may be found, nor are they disposed in any orderly series,nor generated from any certain end; and hence they have a great similitude tothe vices, which are numerous, inordinate, and indefinite.”"},{"pageContent":"THE TABLE OF THE TEN NUMBERS (The following outline of the Pythagorean numbers is a paraphrase of thewritings of Nicomachus, Theon of Smyrna, Proclus, Porphyry, Plutarch, Clement ofAlexandria, Aristotle, and other early authorities.)Monad—1—is so called because it remains always in the same condition—that is,separate from multitude. Its attributes are as follows: It is called mind,because the mind is stable and has preeminence; hermaphrodism, because it isboth male and female; odd and even, for being added to the even it makes odd,and to the odd, even; God, because it is the beginning and end of all, butitself has neither beginning nor end; good, for such is the nature of God; thereceptacle of matter, because it produces the duad, which is essentiallymaterial.By the Pythagoreans monad was called chaos, obscurity, chasm, Tartarus, Styx,abyss, Lethe, Atlas, Axis, Morpho (a name for Venus), and Tower or Throne ofJupiter, because of the great power which abides in the center of the universeand controls the circular motion of the planets about itself. Monad is alsocalled germinal reason, because it is the origin of all the thoughts in theuniverse. Other names given to it were: Apollo, because of its relation to thesun; Prometheus, because he brought man light; Pyralios, one who exists in fire;geniture, because without it no number can exist; substance, because substanceis primary; cause of truth; and constitution of symphony: all these because itis the primordial one.Between greater and lesser the monad is equal; between intention and remissionit is middle; in multitude it is mean; and in time it is now, because eternityknows neither past nor future. It is called Jupiter, because he is Father andhead of the gods; Vesta, the fire of the home, because it is located in themidst of the universe and remains there inclining to no side as a dot in acircle; form, because it circumscribes, comprehends, and terminates; love,concord, and piety, because it is indivisible. Other symbolic names for themonad are ship, chariot, Proteus (a god capable of changing his form),Mnemosyne, and Polyonymous (having many names).The following symbolic names were given to the duad—2—because it has beendivided, and is two rather than one; and when there are two, each is opposed tothe other: genius, evil, darkness, inequality, instability, movability,boldness, fortitude, contention, matter, dissimilarity, partition betweenmultitude and monad, defect, shapelessness, indefiniteness, indeterminateness,harmony, tolerance, root, feet of fountain-abounding idea, top, Phanes, opinion,fallacy, alterity, diffidence, impulse, death, motion, generation, mutation,division, longitude, augmentation, composition, communion, misfortune, sustenta-tion, imposition, marriage, soul, and science.In his book, Numbers, W. Wynn Westcott says of the duad: “It was called‘Audacity,’ from its being the earliest number to separate itself from theDivine One; from the ‘Adytum of God-nourished Silence,’ as the Chaldean oraclessay.”As the monad is the father, so the duad is the mother; therefore, the duad hascertain points in common with the goddesses Isis, Rhea (Jove’s mother), Phrygia,Lydia, Dindymene (Cybele), and Ceres; Erato (one of the Muses); Diana, becausethe moon is forked; Dictynna, Venus, Dione, Cytherea; Juno, because she is bothwife and sister of Jupiter; and Maia, the mother of Mercury.While the monad is the symbol of wisdom, the duad is the symbol of ignorance,for in it exists the sense of separateness—which sense is the beginning ofignorance. The duad, however, is also the mother of wisdom, for ignorance—out ofthe nature of itself—invariably gives birth to wisdom.The Pythagoreans revered the monad but despised the duad, because it was thesymbol of polarity. By the power of the duad the deep was created incontradistinction to the heavens. The deep mirrored the heavens and became thesymbol of illusion, for the below was merely a reflection of the above. Thebelow was called maya, the illusion, the sea, the Great Void, and to symbolizeit the Magi of Persia carried mirrors. From the duad arose disputes andcontentions, until by bringing the monad between the duad, equilibrium wasreestablished by the Savior-God, who took upon Himself the form of a number andwas crucified between two thieves for the sins of men.The triad—3—is the first number actually odd (monad not always being considereda number). It is the first equilibrium of unities; therefore, Pythagoras saidthat Apollo gave oracles from a tripod, and advised offer of libation threetimes. The keywords to the qualities of the triad are friendship, peace,justice, prudence, piety, temperance, and virtue. The following deities partakeof the principles of the triad: Saturn (ruler of time), Latona, Cornucopiæ,Ophion (the great serpent), Thetis, Hecate, Polyhymnia (a Muse), Pluto, Triton,President of the Sea, Tritogenia, Achelous, and the Fates, Furies, and Graces.This number is called wisdom, because men organize the present, foresee thefuture, and benefit by the experiences of the past. It is cause of wisdom andunderstanding. The triad is the number of knowledge—music, geometry, andastronomy, and the science of the celestials and terrestrials. Pythagoras taughtthat the cube of this number had the power of the lunar circle.The sacredness of the triad and its symbol—the triangle—is derived from the factthat it is made up of the monad and the duad. The monad is the symbol of theDivine Father and the duad of the Great Mother. The triad being made of thesetwo is therefore androgynous and is symbolic of the fact that God gave birth toHis worlds out of Himself, who in His creative aspect is always symbolized bythe triangle. The monad passing into the duad was thus capable of becoming theparent of progeny, for the duad was the womb of Meru, within which the world wasincubated and within which it still exists in embryo.The tetrad—4—was esteemed by the Pythagoreans as the primogenial number, theroot of all things, the fountain of Nature and the most perfect number. Alltetrads are intellectual; they have an emergent order and encircle the world asthe Empyreum passes through it. Why the Pythagoreans expressed God as a tetradis explained in a sacred discourse ascribed to Pythagoras, wherein God is calledthe Number of Numbers. This is because the decad, or 10, is composed of 1, 2, 3,and 4. The number 4 is symbolic of God because it is symbolic of the first fournumbers. Moreover, the tetrad is the center of the week, being halfway between 1and 7. The tetrad is also the first geometric solid.Pythagoras maintained that the soul of man consists of a tetrad, the four powersof the soul being mind, science, opinion, and sense. The tetrad connects allbeings, elements, numbers, and seasons; nor can anything be named which does notdepend upon the tetractys. It is the Cause and Maker of all things, theintelligible God, Author of celestial and sensible good. Plutarch interpretsthis tetractys, which he said was also called the world, to be 36, consisting ofthe first four odd numbers added to the first four even numbers, thus:061 [images/00062.jpg] Keywords given to the tetrad are impetuosity, strength, virility, two-mothered,and the key keeper of Nature, because the universal constitution cannot bewithout it. It is also called harmony and the first profundity. The followingdeities partook of the nature of the tetrad: Hercules, Mercury, Vulcan, Bacchus,and Urania (one of the Muses).The triad represents the primary colors and the major planets, while the tetradrepresents the secondary colors and the minor planets. From the first trianglecome forth the seven spirits, symbolized by a triangle and a square. Thesetogether form the Masonic apron.The pentad—5—is the union of an odd and an even number (3 and 2). Among theGreeks, the pentagram was a sacred symbol of light, health, and vitality. Italso symbolized the fifth element—ether—because it is free from the disturbancesof the four lower elements. It is called equilibrium, because it divides theperfect number 10 into two equal parts.The pentad is symbolic of Nature, for, when multiplied by itself it returns intoitself, just as grains of wheat, starting in the form of seed, pass throughNature’s processes and reproduce the seed of the wheat as the ultimate form oftheir own growth. Other numbers multiplied by themselves produce other numbers,but only 5 and 6 multiplied by themselves represent and retain their originalnumber as the last figure in their products.The pentad represents all the superior and inferior beings. It is sometimesreferred to as the hierophant, or the priest of the Mysteries, because of itsconnection with the spiritual ethers, by means of which mystic development isattained. Keywords of the pentad are reconciliation, alternation, marriage,immortality, cordiality, providence, and sound. Among the deities who partook ofthe nature of the pentad were Pallas, Nemesis, Bubastia (Bast), Venus,Androgynia, Cytherea, and the messengers of Jupiter.The tetrad (the elements) plus the monad equals the pentad. The Pythagoreanstaught that the elements of earth, fire, air, and water were permeated by asubstance called ether—the basis of vitality and life. Therefore, they chose thefive-pointed star, or pentagram, as the symbol of vitality, health, andinterpenetration.It was customary for the philosophers to conceal the element of earth under thesymbol of a dragon, and many of the heroes of antiquity were told to go forthand slay the dragon. Hence, they drove their sword (the monad) into the body ofthe dragon (the tetrad). This resulted in the formation of the pentad, a symbolof the victory of the spiritual nature over the material nature. The fourelements are symbolized in the early Biblical writings as the four rivers thatpoured out of the Garden of Eden. The elements themselves are under the controlof the composite Cherubim of Ezekiel.The Pythagoreans held the hexad—6—to represent, as Clement of Alexandriaconceived, the creation of the world according to both the prophets and theancient Mysteries. It was called by the Pythagoreans the perfection of all theparts. This number was particularly sacred to Orpheus, and also to the Fate,Lachesis, and the Muse Thalia. It was called the form of forms, the articulationof the universe, and the maker of the soul.Among the Greeks, harmony and the soul were considered to be similar in nature,because all souls are harmonic. The hexad is also the symbol of marriage,because it is formed by the union of two triangles, one masculine and the otherfeminine. Among the keywords given to the hexad are: time, for it is the measureof duration; panacea, because health is equilibrium, and the hexad is a balancenumber; the world, because the world, like the hexad, is often seen to consistof contraries by harmony; omnisufficient, because its parts are sufficient fortotality (3 + 2 + 1 = 6); unwearied, because it contains the elements ofimmortality.By the Pythagoreans the heptad—7—was called “worthy of veneration.” It was heldto be the number of religion, because man is controlled by seven celestialspirits to whom it is proper for him to make offerings. It was called the numberof life, because it was believed that human creatures born in the seventh monthof embryonic life usually lived, but those born in the eighth month often died.One author called it the Motherless Virgin, Minerva, because it was not born ofa mother but out of the crown, or the head of the Father, the monad. Keywords ofthe heptad are fortune, occasion, custody, control, government, judgment,dreams, voices, sounds, and that which leads all things to their end. Deitieswhose attributes were expressed by the heptad were Ægis, Osiris, Mars, and Cleo(one of the Muses).Among many ancient nations the heptad is a sacred number. The Elohim of the Jewswere supposedly seven in number. They were the Spirits of the Dawn, morecommonly known as the Archangels controlling the planets. The seven Archangels,with the three spirits controlling the sun in its threefold aspect, constitutethe 10, the sacred Pythagorean decad. The mysterious Pythagorean tetractys, orfour rows of dots, increasing from 1 to 4, was symbolic of the stages ofcreation. The great Pythagorean truth that all things in Nature are regeneratedthrough the decad, or 10, is subtly preserved in Freemasonry through the grips;these grips being effected by the uniting of 10 fingers, five on the hand ofeach person.The 3 (spirit, mind, and soul) descend into the 4 (the world), the sum being the7, or the mystic nature of man, consisting of a threefold spiritual body and afourfold material form. These are symbolized by the cube, which has six surfacesand a mysterious seventh point within. The six surfaces are the directions:north, east, south, west, up, and down; or, front, back, right, left, above, andbelow; or again, earth, fire, air, water, spirit, and matter. In the midst ofthese stands the 1, which is the upright figure of man, from whose center in thecube radiate six pyramids. From this comes the great occult axiom: “The centeris the father of the directions, the dimensions, and the distances.”The heptad is the number of the law, because it is the number of the Makers ofCosmic law, the Seven Spirits before the Throne.The ogdoad—8—was sacred because it was the number of the first cube, which formhad eight corners, and was the only evenly-even number under 10 (1-2-4-8-4-2-1).Thus, the 8 is divided into two 4’s, each 4 is divided into two 2’s, and each 2is divided into two 1’s, thereby reestablishing the monad. Among the keywords ofthe ogdoad are love, counsel, prudence, law, and convenience. Among thedivinities partaking of its nature were Panarmonia, Rhea, Cibele, Cadmæa,Dindymene, Orcia, Neptune, Themis, and Euterpe (a Muse).The ogdoad was a mysterious number associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries ofGreece and the Cabiri. It was called the little holy number. It derived its formpartly from the twisted snakes on the Caduceus of Hermes and partly from theserpentine motion of the celestial bodies; possibly also from the moon’s nodes.The ennead—9—was the first square of an odd number (3 X 3). It was associatedwith failure and shortcoming, because it fell short of the perfect number 10 byone. It was called the number of man, because of the nine months of hisembryonic life. Among its keywords are ocean and horizon, because to theancients these were boundless. The ennead is the limitless number because thereis nothing beyond it but the infinite 10. It was called boundary and limitation,because it gathered all numbers within itself. It was called the sphere of theair, because it surrounded the numbers as air surrounds the earth. Among thegods and goddesses who partook in greater or less degree of its nature werePrometheus, Vulcan, Juno, the sister and wife of Jupiter, Pæan, and Aglaia,Tritogenia, Curetes, Proserpine, Hyperion, and Terpsichore (a Muse).The 9 was looked upon as evil, because it was an inverted 6. According to theEleusinian Mysteries, it was the number of the spheres through which theconsciousness passed on its way to birth. Because of its close resemblance tothe spermatozoon, the 9 has been associated with germinal life.The decad—10—according to the Pythagoreans, is the greatest of numbers, not onlybecause it is the tetractys (the 10 dots) but because it comprehends allarithmetic and harmonic proportions. Pythagoras said that 10 is the nature ofnumber, because all nations reckon to it and when they arrive at it they returnto the monad. The decad was called both heaven and the world, because the formerincludes the latter. Being a perfect number, the decad was applied by thePythagoreans to those things relating to age, power, faith, necessity, and thepower of memory. It was also called unwearied, because, like God, it wastireless. The Pythagoreans divided the heavenly bodies into ten orders. Theyalso stated that the decad perfected all numbers and comprehended within itselfthe nature of odd and even, moved and unmoved, good and ill. They associated itspower with the following deities: Atlas (for it carried the numbers on itsshoulders), Urania, Mnemosyne, the Sun, Phanes, and the One God.The decimal system can probably be traced back to the time when it was customaryto reckon on the fingers, these being among the most primitive of calculatingdevices and still in use among many aboriginal peoples."},{"pageContent":"XV The Human Body in Symbolism The oldest, the most profound, the most universal of all symbols is the humanbody. The Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, and Hindus considered a philosophicalanalysis of man’s triune nature to be an indispensable part of ethical andreligious training. The Mysteries of every nation taught that the laws,elements, and powers of the universe were epitomized in the human constitution;that everything which existed outside of man had its analogue within man. Theuniverse, being immeasurable in its immensity and inconceivable in itsprofundity, was beyond mortal estimation. Even the gods themselves couldcomprehend but a part of the inaccessible glory which was their source. Whentemporarily permeated with divine enthusiasm, man may transcend for a briefmoment the limitations of his own personality and behold in part that celestialeffulgence in which all creation is bathed. But even in his periods of greatestillumination man is incapable of imprinting upon the substance of his rationalsoul a perfect image of the multiform expression of celestial activity.Recognizing the futility of attempting to cope intellectually with that whichtranscends the comprehension of the rational faculties, the early philosophersturned their attention from the inconceivable Divinity to man himself, withinthe narrow confines of whose nature they found manifested all the mysteries ofthe external spheres. As the natural outgrowth of this practice there wasfabricated a secret theological system in which God was considered as the GrandMan and, conversely, man as the little god. Continuing this analogy, theuniverse was regarded as a man and, conversely, man as a miniature universe. Thegreater universe was termed the Macrocosm—the Great World or Body—and the DivineLife or spiritual entity controlling its functions was called theMacroprosophus. Man’s body, or the individual human universe, was termed theMicrocosm, and the Divine Life or spiritual entity controlling its functions wascalled the Microprosophus. The pagan Mysteries were primarily concerned withinstructing neophytes in the true relationship existing between the Macrocosmand the Microcosm—in other words, between God and man. Accordingly, the key tothese analogies between the organs and functions of the Microcosmic man andthose of the Macrocosmic Man constituted the most prized possession of the earlyinitiates.062 [images/00063.jpg] THE TETRAGRAMMATON IN THE HUMAN HEART.The Tetragrammaton, or four-lettered Name of God, is here arranged as atetractys within the inverted human heart. Beneath, the name Jehovah is showntransformed into Jehoshuo by the interpolation of the radiant Hebrew letter063[images/00064.jpg].Shin. The drawing as a whole represents the throne of God andHis hierarchies within the heart of man. In the first book of his LibriApologetici, Jakob Böhme thus describes the meaning of the symbol: “For we menhave one book in common which points to God. Each has it within himself, whichis the priceless Name of God. Its letters are the flames of His love, which Heout of His heart in the priceless Name of Jesus has revealed in us. Read theseletters in your hearts and spirits and you have books enough. All the writingsof the children of God direct you unto that one book, for therein lie all thetreasures of wisdom.··· * This book is Christ in you.” In Isis Unveiled, H. P. Blavatsky summarizes the pagan concept of man asfollows: “Man is a little world—a microcosm inside the great universe. Like afetus, he is suspended, by all his three spirits, in the matrix of themacrocosmos; and while his terrestrial body is in constant sympathy with itsparent earth, his astral soul lives in unison with the sidereal anima mundi. Heis in it, as it is in him, for the world-pervading element fills all space, andis space itself, only shoreless and infinite. As to his third spirit, thedivine, what is it but an infinitesimal ray, one of the countless radiationsproceeding directly from the Highest Cause—the Spiritual Light of the World?This is the trinity of organic and inorganic nature—the spiritual and thephysical, which are three in one, and of which Proclus says that ‘The firstmonad is the Eternal God; the second, eternity; the third, the paradigm, orpattern of the universe;’ the three constituting the Intelligible Triad.”Long before the introduction of idolatry into religion, the early priests causedthe statue of a man to be placed in the sanctuary of the temple. This humanfigure symbolized the Divine Power in all its intricate manifestations. Thus thepriests of antiquity accepted man as their textbook, and through the study ofhim learned to understand the greater and more abstruse mysteries of thecelestial scheme of which they were a part. It is not improbable that thismysterious figure standing over the primitive altars was made in the nature of amanikin and, like certain emblematic hands in the Mystery schools, was coveredwith either carved or painted hieroglyphs. The statue may have opened, thusshowing the relative positions of the organs, bones, muscles, nerves, and otherparts. After ages of research, the manikin became a mass of intricatehieroglyphs and symbolic figures. Every part had its secret meaning. Themeasurements formed a basic standard by means of which it was possible tomeasure all parts of cosmos. It was a glorious composite emblem of all theknowledge possessed by the sages and hierophants.Then came the age of idolatry. The Mysteries decayed from within. The secretswere lost and none knew the identity of the mysterious man who stood over thealtar. It was remembered only that the figure was a sacred and glorious symbolof the Universal Power, and it finally came to be looked upon as a god—the Onein whose image man was made. Having lost the knowledge of the purpose for whichthe manikin was originally constructed, the priests worshiped this efhgy untilat last their lack of spiritual understanding brought the temple down in ruinsabout their heads and the statue crumbled with the civilization that hadforgotten its meaning.Proceeding from this assumption of the first theologians that man is actuallyfashioned in the image of God, the initiated minds of past ages erected thestupendous structure of theology upon the foundation of the human body. Thereligious world of today is almost totally ignorant of the fact that the scienceof biology is the fountainhead of its doctrines and tenets. Many of the codesand laws believed by modern divines to have been direct revelations fromDivinity are in reality the fruitage of ages of patient delving into theintricacies of the human constitution and the infinite wonders revealed by sucha study.In nearly all the sacred books of the world can be traced an anatomical analogy.This is most evident in their creation myths. Anyone familiar with embryologyand obstetrics will have no difficulty in recognizing the basis of the allegoryconcerning Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the nine degrees of theEleusinian Mysteries, and the Brahmanic legend of Vishnu’s incarnations. Thestory of the Universal Egg, the Scandinavian myth of Ginnungagap (the dark cleftin space in which the seed of the world is sown), and the use of the fish as theemblem of the paternal generative power—all show the true origin of theologicalspeculation. The philosophers of antiquity realized that man himself was the keyto the riddle of life, for he was the living image of the Divine Plan, and infuture ages humanity also will come to realize more fully the solemn import ofthose ancient words: “The proper study of mankind is man.”Both God and man have a twofold constitution, of which the superior part isinvisible and the inferior visible. In both there is also an intermediarysphere, marking the point where these visible and invisible natures meet. As thespiritual nature of God controls His objective universal form—which is actuallya crystallized idea—so the spiritual nature of man is the invisible cause andcontrolling power of his visible material personality. Thus it is evident thatthe spirit of man bears the same relationship to his material body that Godbears to the objective universe. The Mysteries taught that spirit, or life, wasanterior to form and that what is anterior includes all that is posterior toitself. Spirit being anterior to form, form is therefore included within therealm of spirit. It is also a popular statement or belief that man’s spirit iswithin his body. According to the conclusions of philosophy and theology,however, this belief is erroneous, for spirit first circumscribes an area andthen manifests within it. Philosophically speaking, form, being a part ofspirit, is within spirit; but spirit is more than the sum of form. As thematerial nature of man is therefore within the sum of spirit, so the UniversalNature, including the entire system, is within the all-pervading essence ofGod—the Universal Spirit.According to another concept of the ancient wisdom, all bodies—whether spiritualor material—have three centers, called by the Greeks the upper center, themiddle center, and the lower center. An apparent ambiguity will here be noted.To diagram or symbolize adequately abstract mental verities is impossible, forthe diagrammatic representation of one aspect of metaphysical relationships maybe an actual contradiction of some other aspect. While that which is above isgenerally considered superior in dignity and power, in reality that which is inthe center is superior and anterior to both that which is said to be above andthat which is said to be below. Therefore, it must be said that the first—whichis considered as being above—is actually in the center, while both of the others(which are said to be either above or below) are actually beneath. This pointcan be further simplified if the reader will consider above as indicating degreeof proximity to source and below as indicating degree of distance from source,source being posited in the actual center and relative distance being thevarious points along the radii from the center toward the circumference. Inmatters pertaining to philosophy and theology, up may be considered as towardthe center and down as toward the circumference. Center is spirit; circumferenceis matter. Therefore, up is toward spirit along an ascending scale ofspirituality; down is toward matter along an ascending scale of materiality. Thelatter concept is partly expressed by the apex of a cone which, when viewed fromabove, is seen as a point in the exact center of the circumference formed by thebase of the cone.These three universal centers—the one above, the one below, and the link unitingthem—represent three suns or three aspects of one sun—centers of effulgence.These also have their analogues in the three grand centers of the human body,which, like the physical universe, is a Demiurgic fabrication. “The first ofthese [suns],” says Thomas Taylor, “is analogous to light when viewed subsistingin its fountain the sun; the second to the light immediately proceeding from thesun; and the third to the splendour communicated to other natures by thislight.”Since the superior (or spiritual) center is in the midst of the other two, itsanalogue in the physical body is the heart—the most spiritual and mysteriousorgan in the human body The second center (or the link between the superior andinferior worlds) is elevated to the position of greatest physical dignity—thebrain. The third (or lower) center is relegated to the position of leastphysical dignity but greatest physical importance—the generative system. Thusthe heart is symbolically the source of life; the brain the link by which,through rational intelligence, life and form are united; and the generativesystem—or infernal creator—the source of that power by which physical organismsare produced. The ideals and aspirations of the individual depend largely uponwhich of these three centers of power predominates in scope and activity ofexpression. In the materialist the lower center is the strongest, in theintellectualist the higher center; but in the initiate the middle center—bybathing the two extremes in a flood of spiritual effulgence—controls wholesomelyboth the mind and the body.As light bears witness of life—which is its source—so the mind bears witness ofthe spirit, and activity in a still lower plane bears witness of intelligence.Thus the mind bears witness of the heart, while the generative system, in turn,bears witness of the mind. Accordingly, the spiritual nature is most commonlysymbolized by a heart; the intellectual power by an opened eye, symbolizing thepineal gland or Cyclopean eye, which is the two-faced Janus of the paganMysteries; and the generative system by a flower, a staff, a cup, or a hand.While all the Mysteries recognized the heart as the center of spiritualconsciousness, they often purposely ignored this concept and used the heart inits exoteric sense as the symbol of the emotional nature. In this arrangementthe generative center represented the physical body, the heart the emotionalbody, and the brain the mental body. The brain represented the superior sphere,but after the initiates had passed through the lower degrees they wereinstructed that the brain was the proxy of the spiritual flame dwelling in theinnermost recesses of the heart. The student of esotericism discovers ere longthat the ancients often resorted to various blinds to conceal the trueinterpretations of their Mysteries. The substitution of the brain for the heartwas one of these blinds.The three degrees of the ancient Mysteries were, with few exceptions, given inchambers which represented the three great centers of the human and Universalbodies. If possible, the temple itself was constructed in the form of the humanbody The candidate entered between the feet and received the highest degree inthe point corresponding to the brain. Thus the first degree was the materialmystery and its symbol was the generative system; it raised the candidatethrough the various degrees of concrete thought. The second degree was given inthe chamber corresponding to the heart, but represented the middle power whichwas the mental link. Here the candidate was initiated into the mysteries ofabstract thought and lifted as high as the mind was capable of penetrating. Hethen passed into the third chamber, which, analogous to the brain, occupied thehighest position in the temple but, analogous to the heart, was of the greatestdignity. In the brain chamber the heart mystery was given. Here the initiate forthe first time truly comprehended the meaning of those immortal words: “As a manthinketh in his heart, so is he.” As there are seven hearts in the brain sothere are seven brains in the heart, but this is a matter of superphysics ofwhich little can be said at the present time.Proclus writes on this subject in the first book of On the Theology of Plato:“Indeed, Socrates in the (First) Alcibiades rightly observes, that the soulentering into herself will behold all other things, and deity itself. Forverging to her own union, and to the centre of all life, laying aside multitude,and the variety of the all manifold powers which she contains, she ascends tothe highest watch-tower of beings. And as in the most holy of the mysteries,they say, that the mystics at first meet with the multiform, and many-shapedgenera, which are hurled forth before the gods, but on entering the temple,unmoved, and guarded by the mystic rites, they genuinely receive in their bosom[heart] divine illumination, and divested of their garments, as they would say,participate of a divine nature; the same mode, as it appears to me, takes placein the speculation of wholes. For the soul when looking at things posterior toherself, beholds the shadows and images of beings, but when she converts herselfto herself she evolves her own essence, and the reasons which she contains. Andat first indeed, she only as it were beholds herself; but, when she penetratesmore profoundly into the knowledge of herself, she finds in herself bothintellect, and the orders of beings. When however, she proceeds into herinterior recesses, and into the adytum as it were of the soul, she perceiveswith her eye closed [without the aid of the lower mind], the genus of the gods,and the unities of beings. For all things are in us psychically, and throughthis we are naturally capable of knowing all things, by exciting the powers andthe images of wholes which we contain.”The initiates of old warned their disciples that an image is not a reality butmerely the objectification of a subjective idea. The images of the gods were notdesigned to be objects of worship but were to be regarded merely as emblems orreminders of invisible powers and principles. Similarly, the body of man mustnot be considered as the individual but only as the house of the individual, inthe same manner that the temple was the House of God. In a state of grossnessand perversion man’s body is the tomb or prison of a divine principle; in astate of unfoldment and regeneration it is the House or Sanctuary of the Deityby whose creative powers it was fashioned. “Personality is suspended upon athread from the nature of Being,” declares the secret work. Man is essentially apermanent and immortal principle; only his bodies pass through the cycle ofbirth and death. The immortal is the reality; the mortal is the unreality Duringeach period of earth life, reality thus dwells in unreality, to be liberatedfrom it temporarily by death and permanently by illumination.While generally regarded as polytheists, the pagans gained this reputation notbecause they worshiped more than one God but rather because they personified theattributes of this God, thereby creating a pantheon of posterior deities eachmanifesting a part of what the One God manifested as a whole. The variouspantheons of ancient religious therefore actually represent the catalogued andpersonified attributes of Deity. In this respect they correspond to thehierarchies of the Hebrew Qabbalists. All the gods and goddesses of antiquityconsequently have their analogies in the human body, as have also the elements,planets, and constellations which were assigned as proper vehicles for thesecelestials. Four body centers are assigned to the elements, the seven vitalorgans to the planets, the twelve principal parts and members to the zodiac, theinvisible parts of man’s divine nature to various supermundane deities, whilethe hidden God was declared to manifest through the marrow in the bones.It is difficult for many to realize that they are actual universes; that theirphysical bodies are a visible nature through the structure of which countlesswaves of evolving life are unfolding their latent potentialities. Yet throughman’s physical body not only are a mineral, a plant, and an animal kingdomevolving, but also unknown classifications and divisions of invisible spirituallife. Just as cells are infinitesimal units in the structure of man, so man isan infinitesimal unit in the structure of the universe. A theology based uponthe knowledge and appreciation of these relationships is as profoundly just asit is profoundly true.As man’s physical body has five distinct and important extremities—two legs, twoarms, and a head, of which the last governs the first four—the number 5 has beenaccepted as the symbol of man. By its four comers the pyramid symbolizes thearms and legs, and by its apex the head, thus indicating that one rational powercontrols four irrational corners. The hands and feet are used to represent thefour elements, of which the two feet are earth and water, and the two hands fireand air. The brain then symbolizes the sacred fifth element—aether—whichcontrols and unites the other four. If the feet are placed together and the armsoutspread, man then symbolizes the cross with the rational intellect as the heador upper limb.The fingers and toes also have special significance. The toes represent the TenCommandments of the physical law and the fingers the Ten Commandments of thespiritual law. The four fingers of each hand represent the four elements and thethree phalanges of each finger represent the divisions of the element, so thatin each hand there are twelve parts to the fingers, which are analogous to thesigns of the zodiac, whereas the two phalanges and base of each thumb signifydie threefold Deity. The first phalange corresponds to the creative aspect, thesecond to the preservative aspect, and the base to the generative anddestructive aspect. When the hands are brought together, the result is thetwenty-four Elders and the six Days of Creation.In symbolism the body is divided vertically into halves, the right half beingconsidered as light and the left half as darkness. By those unacquainted withthe true meanings of light and darkness the light half was denominated spiritualand the left half material. Light is the symbol of objectivity; darkness ofsubjectivity Light is a manifestation of life and is therefore posterior tolife. That which is anterior to light is darkness, in which light existstemporarily but darkness permanently. As life precedes light, its only symbol isdarkness, and darkness is considered as the veil which must eternally concealthe true nature of abstract and undifferentiated Being.In ancient times men fought with their right arms and defended the vital centerswith their left arms, on which was carried the protecting shield. The right halfof the body was regarded therefore as offensive and the left half defensive. Forthis reason also the right side of the body was considered masculine and theleft side feminine. Several authorities are of the opinion that the presentprevalent right-handedness of the race is the outgrowth of the custom of holdingthe left hand in restraint for defensive purposes. Furthermore, as the source ofBeing is in the primal darkness which preceded light, so the spiritual nature ofman is in the dark part of his being, for the heart is on the left side.Among the curious misconceptions arising from the false practice of associatingdarkness with evil is one by which several early nations used the right hand forall constructive labors and the left hand for only those purposes termed uncleanand unfit for the sight of the gods. For the same reason black magic was oftenreferred to as the left-hand path, and heaven was said to be upon the right andhell upon the left. Some philosophers further declared that there were twomethods of writing: one from left to right, which was considered the exotericmethod; the other from right to left, which was considered esoteric. Theexoteric writing was that which was done out or away from the heart, while theesoteric writing was that which—like the ancient Hebrew—was written toward theheart.The secret doctrine declares that every part and member of the body isepitomized in the brain and, in turn, that all that is in the brain isepitomized in the heart. In symbolism the human head is frequently used torepresent intelligence and self-knowledge. As the human body in its entirety isthe most perfect known product of the earth’s evolution, it was employed torepresent Divinity—the highest appreciable state or condition. Artists,attempting to portray Divinity, often show only a hand emerging from animpenetrable cloud. The cloud signifies the Unknowable Divinity concealed fromman by human limitation. The hand signifies the Divine activity, the only partof God which is cognizable to the lower senses.The face consists of a natural trinity: the eyes representing the spiritualpower which comprehends; the nostrils representing the preservative andvivifying power; and the mouth and ears representing the material Demiurgicpower of the lower world. The first sphere is eternally existent and iscreative; the second sphere pertains to the mystery of the creative breath; andthe third sphere to the creative word. By the Word of God the material universewas fabricated, and the seven creative powers, or vowel sounds—which had beenbrought into existence by the speaking of the Word—became the seven Elohim orDeities by whose power and ministration the lower world was organized.Occasionally the Deity is symbolized by an eye, an ear, a nose, or a mouth. Bythe first, Divine awareness is signified; by the second, Divine interest; by thethird, Divine vitality; and by the fourth, Divine command.The ancients did not believe that spirituality made men either righteous orrational, but rather that righteousness and rationality made men spiritual. TheMysteries taught that spiritual illumination was attained only by bringing thelower nature up to a certain standard of efficiency and purity. The Mysterieswere therefore established for the purpose of unfolding the nature of manaccording to certain fixed rules which, when faithfully followed, elevated thehuman consciousness to a point where it was capable of cognizing its ownconstitution and the true purpose of existence. This knowledge of how man’smanifold constitution could be most quickly and most completely regenerated tothe point of spiritual illumination constituted the secret, or esoteric,doctrine of antiquity Certain apparently physical organs and centers are inreality the veils or sheaths of spiritual centers. What these were and how theycould be unfolded was never revealed to the unregenerate, for the philosophersrealized that once he understands the complete working of any system, a man mayaccomplish a prescribed end without being qualified to manipulate and controlthe effects which he has produced. For this reason long periods of probationwere imposed, so that the knowledge of how to become as the gods might remainthe sole possession of the worthy.Lest that knowledge be lost, however, it was concealed in allegories and mythswhich were meaningless to the profane but self-evident to those acquainted withthat theory of personal redemption which was the foundation of philosophicaltheology. Christianity itself may be cited as an example. The entire NewTestament is in fact an ingeniously concealed exposition of the secret processesof human regeneration. The characters so long considered as historical men andwomen are really the personification of certain processes which take place inthe human body when man begins the task of consciously liberating himself fromthe bondage of ignorance and death.The garments and ornamentations supposedly worn by the gods are also keys, forin the Mysteries clothing was considered as synonymous with form. The degree ofspirituality or materiality of the organisms was signified by the quality,beauty, and value of the garments worn. Man’s physical body was looked upon asthe robe of his spiritual nature; consequently, the more developed were hissupersubstantial powers the more glorious his apparel. Of course, clothing wasoriginally worn for ornamentation rather than protection, and such practicestill prevails among many primitive peoples. The Mysteries taught that man’sonly lasting adornments were his virtues and worthy characteristics; that he wasclothed in his own accomplishments and adorned by his attainments. Thus thewhite robe was symbolic of purity, the red robe of sacrifice and love, and theblue robe of altruism and integrity. Since the body was said to be the robe ofthe spirit, mental or moral deformities were depicted as deformities of thebody.Considering man’s body as the measuring rule of the universe, the philosophersdeclared that all things resemble in constitution—if not in form—the human body.The Greeks, for example, declared Delphi to be the navel of the earth, for thephysical planet was looked upon as a gigantic human being twisted into the formof a ball. In contradistinction to the belief of Christendom that the earth isan inanimate thing, the pagans considered not only the earth but also all thesidereal bodies as individual creatures possessing individual intelligences.They even went so far as to view the various kingdoms of Nature as individualentities. The animal kingdom, for example, was looked upon as one being—acomposite of all the creatures composing that kingdom. This prototypic beast wasa mosaic embodiment of all animal propensities and within its nature the entireanimal world existed as the human species exists within the constitution of theprototypic Adam.In the same manner, races, nations, tribes, religions, states, communities, andcities were viewed as composite entities, each made up of varying numbers ofindividual units. Every community has an individuality which is the sum of theindividual attitudes of its inhabitants. Every religion is an individual whosebody is made up of a hierarchy and vast host of individual worshipers. Theorganization of any religion represents its physical body, and its individualmembers the cell life making up this organism. Accordingly, religions, races,and communities—like individuals—pass through Shakespeare’s Seven Ages, for thelife of man is a standard by which the perpetuity of all things is estimated.According to the secret doctrine, man, through the gradual refinement of hisvehicles and the ever-increasing sensitiveness resulting from that refinement,is gradually overcoming the limitations of matter and is disentangling himselffrom his mortal coil. When humanity has completed its physical evolution, theempty shell of materiality left behind will be used by other life waves asstepping-stones to their own liberation. The trend of man’s evolutionary growthis ever toward his own essential Selfhood. At the point of deepest materialism,therefore, man is at the greatest distance from Himself. According to theMystery teachings, not all the spiritual nature of man incarnates in matter. Thespirit of man is diagrammatically shown as an equilateral triangle with onepoint downward. This lower point, which is one-third of the spiritual nature butin comparison to the dignity of the other two is much less than a third,descends into the illusion of material existence for a brief space of time. Thatwhich never clothes itself in the sheath of matter is the Hermetic Anthropos—theOverman—analogous to the Cyclops or guardian dœmon of the Greeks, the angel ofJakob Böhme, and the Oversoul of Emerson, “that Unity, that Oversoul, withinwhich every man’s particular being is contained and made one with all other.”At birth only a third part of the Divine Nature of man temporarily dissociatesitself from its own immortality and takes upon itself the dream of physicalbirth and existence, animating with its own celestial enthusiasm a vehiclecomposed of material elements, part of and bound to the material sphere. Atdeath this incarnated part awakens from the dream of physical existence andreunites itself once more with its eternal condition. This periodical descent ofspirit into matter is termed the wheel of life and death, and the principlesinvolved are treated at length by the philosophers under the subject ofmetempsychosis. By initiation into the Mysteries and a certain process known asoperative theology, this law of birth and death is transcended, and during thecourse of physical existence that part of the spirit which is asleep in form isawakened without the intervention of death—the inevitable Initiator—and isconsciously reunited with the Anthropos, or the overshadowing substance ofitself. This is at once the primary purpose and the consummate achievement ofthe Mysteries: that man shall become aware of and consciously be reunited withthe divine source of himself without tasting of physical dissolution."},{"pageContent":"XVI The Hiramic Legend Then Solomon—the beloved of God, builder of the Everlasting House, and GrandMaster of the Lodge of Jerusalem—ascended the throne of his father David heconsecrated his life to the erection of a temple to God and a palace for thekings of Israel. David’s faithful friend, Hiram, King of Tyre, hearing that ason of David sat upon the throne of Israel, sent messages of con- gratulationand offers of assistance to the new ruler. In his History of the Jews, Josephusmentions that copies of the letters passing between the two kings were then tobe seen both at Jerusalem and at Tyre. Despite Hiram’s lack of appreciation forthe twenty cities of Galilee which Solomon presented to him upon the completionof the temple, the two monarchs remained the best of friends. Both were famousfor their wit and wisdom, and when they exchanged letters each devised puzzlingquestions to test the mental ingenuity of the other. Solomon made an agreementwith Hiram of Tyre promising vast amounts of barley, wheat, corn, wine, and oilas wages for the masons and carpenters from Tyre who were to assist the Jews inthe erection of the temple. Hiram also supplied cedars and other fine trees,which were made into rafts and floated down the sea to Joppa, whence they weretaken inland by Solomon’s workmen to the temple site.Because of his great love for Solomon, Hiram of Tyre sent also the Grand Masterof the Dionysiac Architects, CHiram Abiff, a Widow’s Son, who had no equal amongthe craftsmen of the earth. CHiram is described as being “a Tyrian by birth, butof Israelitish descent,” and “a second Bezaleel, honored by his king with thetitle of Father.” The Freemason’s Pocket Companion (published in 1771) describesCHiram as “the most cunning, skilful and curious workman that ever lived, whoseabilities were not confined to building alone, but extended to all kinds ofwork, whether in gold, silver, brass or iron; whether in linen, tapestry, orembroidery; whether considered as an architect, statuary [sic], founder ordesigner, separately or together, he equally excelled. From his designs, andunder his direction, all the rich and splendid furniture of the Temple and itsseveral appendages were begun, carried on, and finished. Solomon appointed him,in his absence, to fill the chair, as Deputy Grand-Master; and in his presence,Senior Grand-Warden, Master of work, and general overseer of all artists, aswell those whom David had formerly procured from Tyre and Sidon, as those Hiramshould now send.” (Modern Masonic writers differ as to the accuracy of the lastsentence.) Although an immense amount of labor was involved in its construction,Solomon’s Temple—in the words of George Oliver—“was only a small building andvery inferior in point of size to some of our churches.” The number of buildingscontiguous to it and the vast treasure of gold and precious stones used in itsconstruction concentrated a great amount of wealth within the temple area. Inthe midst of the temple stood the Holy of Holies, sometimes called the Oracle.It was an exact cube, each dimension being twenty cubits, and exemplified theinfluence of Egyptian symbolism. The buildings of the temple group wereornamented with 1,453 columns of Parian marble, magnificently sculptured, and2,906 pilasters decorated with capitals. There was a broad porch facing theeast, and the sanctum sanctorum was upon the west. According to tradition, thevarious buildings and courtyards could hold in all 300,000 persons. Both theSanctuary and the Holy of Holies were entirely lined with solid gold platesencrusted with jewels.064 [images/00065.jpg] A MASONIC APRON WITH SYMBOLIC FIGURES.While the mystic symbolism of Freemasonry decrees that the apron shall be asimple square of white lambskin with appropriate flap, Masonic aprons arefrequently decorated with curious and impressive figures. “When silk, cotton, orlinen is worn,” writes Albert Pike, “the symbolism is lost. Nor is one clothedwho blots, defaces, and desecrates the white surface with ornamentation,figuring, or colors of any kind: (See Symbolism.)To Mars, the ancient planet of cosmic energy, the Atlantean and Chaldean “stargazers” assigned Aries as a diurnal throne and Scorpio as a nocturnal throne.Those not raised to spiritual life by initiation are described as “dead from thesting of the scorpion,” for they wander in the night side of divine power.Through the mystery of the Paschal Lamb, or the attainment of the Golden Fleece,these souls are raised into the constructive day power of Mars in Aries—thesymbol of the Creator.When worn over the area related to the animal passions, the pure lambskinsignifies the regeneration of the procreative forces and their consecration tothe service of the Deity. The size of the apron, exclusive of the flap, makes itthe symbol of salvation, for the Mysteries declare that it must consist of 144square inches.The apron shown above contains a wealth of symbolism: the beehive, emblematic ofthe Masonic lodge itself; the trowel, the mallet, and the trestleboard; therough and trued ashlars; the pyramids and hills of Lebanon; the pillars, theTemple, and checkerboard floor; and the blazing star and tools of the Craft. Thecenter of the apron is occupied by the compass and square, representative of theMacrocosm and the microcosm, and the alternately black and white serpent ofastral light. Below is an acacia branch with seven sprigs, signifying the lifecenters of the superior and the inferior man. The skull and crossbones are acontinual reminder that the spiritual nature attains liberation only after thephilosophical death of man’s sensuous personality. King Solomon began the building of the temple in the fourth year of his reign onwhat would be, according to modern calculation, the 21 st day of April, andfinished it in the eleventh year of his reign on the 23rd day of October. Thetemple was begun in the 480th year after the children of Israel had passed theRed Sea. Part of the labor of construction included the building of anartificial foundation on the brow of Mount Moriah. The stones for the templewere hoisted from quarries directly beneath Mount Moriah and were trued beforebeing brought to the surface. The brass and golden ornaments for the temple werecast in molds in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredatha, and the woodenparts were all finished before they reached the temple site. The building wasput together, consequently, without sound and without instruments, all its partsfitting exactly “without the hammer of contention, the axe of division, or anytool of mischief.”Anderson’s much-discussed Constitutions of the Free-Masons, published in Londonin 1723, and reprinted by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia in 1734, thusdescribes the division of the laborers engaged in the building of theEverlasting House:“But Dagon’s Temple, and the finest structures of Tyre and Sidon, could not becompared with the Eternal God’s Temple at Jerusalem, * * * there were employedabout it no less than 3,600 Princes, or Master-Masons, to conduct the workaccording to Solomon’s directions, with 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountain,or Fellow Craftsmen, and 70,000 labourers, in all 153,600 besides the levy underAdoniram to work in the mountains of Lebanon by turns with the Sidonians, viz.,30,000, being in all 183,600.” Daniel Sickels gives 3,300 overseers, instead of3,600, and lists the three Grand Masters separately. The same author estimatesthe cost of the temple at nearly four thousand millions of dollars.The Masonic legend of the building of Solomon’s Temple does not in everyparticular parallel the Scriptural version, especially in those portionsrelating to CHiram Abiff. According to the Biblical account, this Master workmanreturned to his own country; in the Masonic allegory he is foully murdered. Onthis point A. E. Waite, in his New Encycloaedia of Freemasonry, makes thefollowing explanatory comment:“The legend of the Master-Builder is the great allegory of Masonry. It happensthat his figurative story is grounded on the fact of a personality mentioned inHoly Scripture, but this historical background is of the accidents and not theessence; the significance is in the allegory and not in any point of historywhich may lie behind it.”CHiram, as Master of the Builders, divided his workmen into three groups, whichwere termed Entered Apprentices, Fellow-Craftsmen, and Master Masons. To eachdivision he gave certain passwords and signs by which their respectiveexcellence could be quickly determined. While all were classified according totheir merits some were dissatisfied, for they desired a more exalted positionthan they were capable of filling. At last three Fellow-Craftsmen, more daringthan their companions, determined to force CHiram to reveal to them the passwordof the Master’s degree. Knowing that CHiram always went into the unfinishedsanctum sanctorum at high noon to pray, these ruffians—whose names were Jubela,Jubelo, and Jubelum—lay in wait for him, one at each of the main gates of thetemple. CHiram, about to leave the temple by the south gate, was suddenlyconfronted by Jubela armed with a twenty-four-inch gauge. Upon CHiram’s refusalto reveal the Master’s Word, the ruffian struck him on the throat with the rule,and the wounded Master then hastened to the west gate, where Jubelo, armed witha Square, awaited him and made a similar demand. Again CHiram was silent, andthe second assassin struck him on the breast with the square. CHiram thereuponstaggered to the east gate, only to be met there by Jubelum armed with a maul.When CHiram refused him the Master’s Word, Jubelum struck the Master between theeyes with the mallet and CHiram fell dead.The body of CHiram was buried by the murderers over the brow of Mount Moriah anda sprig of acacia placed upon the grave. The murderers then sought to escapepunishment for their crime by embarking for Ethiopia, but the port was closed.All three were finally captured, and after admitting their guilt were dulyexecuted. Parties of three were then sent out by King Solomon, and one of thesegroups discovered the newly made grave marked by the evergreen sprig. After theEntered Apprentices and the Fellow-Craftsmen had failed to resurrect theirMaster from the dead he was finally raised by the Master Mason with the “stronggrip of a Lion’s Paw.”To the initiated Builder the name CHiram Abiff signifies “My Father, theUniversal Spirit, one in essence, three in aspect.” Thus the murdered Master isa type of the Cosmic Martyr—the crucified Spirit of Good, the dying god—whoseMystery is celebrated throughout the world. Among the manuscripts of Dr.Sigismund Bacstrom, the initiated Rosicrucian, appears the following extractfrom von Welling concerning the true philosophic nature of the Masonic CHiram:“The original word065 [images/00066.jpg], CHiram, is a radical word consistingof three consonants066 [images/00067.jpg]and067 [images/00068.jpg]i.e. Cheth,Resh and Mem. (1)068 [images/00069.jpg], Cheth, signifies Chamah, the Sun’slight, i.e. the Universal, invisible, cold fire of Nature attracted by the Sun,manifested into light and sent down to us and to every planetary body belongingto the solar system. (2)069 [images/00070.jpg], Resh, signifies070[images/00071.jpg]Ruach, i.e. Spirit, air, wind, as being the Vehicle whichconveys and collects the light into numberless Foci, wherein the solar rays oflight are agitated by a circular motion and manifested in Heat and burning Fire.(3)071 [images/00072.jpg], or072 [images/00073.jpg], Mem, signifies majim,water, humidity, but rather the mother of water, i.e. Radical Humidity or aparticular kind of condensed air. These three constitute the Universal Agent orfire of Nature in one word,073 [images/00074.jpg]CHiram, not Hiram.”Albert Pike mentions several forms of the name CHiram: Khirm, Khurm, andKhur-Om, the latter ending in the sacred Hindu monosyllable OM, which may alsobe extracted from the names of the three murderers. Pike further relates thethree rufhans to a triad of stars in the constellation of Libra and also callsattention to the fact that the Chaldean god Bal—metamorphosed into a demon bythe Jews—appears in the name of each of the murderers, Jubela, Jubelo, andJubelum. To interpret the Hiramic legend requires familiarity with both thePythagorean and Qabbalistic systems of numbers and letters, and also thephilosophic and astronomic cycles of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Brahmins. Forexample, consider the number 33. The first temple of Solomon stood forthirty-three years in its pristine splendor. At the end of that time it waspillaged by the Egyptian King Shishak, and finally (588 B.C.) it was completelydestroyed by Nebuchadnezzar and the people of Jerusalem were led into captivityto Babylon. (See General History of Freemasonry, by Robert Macoy.) Also KingDavid ruled for thirty-three years in Jerusalem; the Masonic Order is dividedinto thirty-three symbolic degrees; there are thirty-three segments in the humanspinal column; and Jesus was crucified in the thirty-third year of His life.The efforts made to discover the origin of the Hiramic legend show that, whilethe legend in its present form is comparatively modern, its underlyingprinciples run back to remotest antiquity It is generally admitted by modernMasonic scholars that the story of the martyred CHiram is based upon theEgyptian rites of Osiris, whose death and resurrection figuratively portrayedthe spiritual death of man and his regeneration through initiation into theMysteries. CHiram is also identified with Hermes through the inscription on theEmerald Table. From these associations it is evident that CHiram is to beconsidered as a prototype of humanity; in fact he is Plato’s Idea (archetype) ofman. As Adam after the Fall symbolizes the Idea of human degeneration, so CHiramthrough his resurrection symbolizes the Idea of human regeneration.On the 19th day of March, 1314, Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of theKnights Templars, was burned on a pyre erected upon that point of the islet ofthe Seine, at Paris, where afterwards was erected the statue of King Henry IV.(See The Indian Religions, by Hargrave Jennings.) “It is mentioned as atradition in some of the accounts of the burning,” writes Jennings, “that Molay,ere he expired, summoned Clement, the Pope who had pronounced the bull ofabolition against the Order and had condemned the Grand Master to the flames, toappear, within forty days, before the Supreme Eternal Judge, and Philip [theking] to the same awful tribunal within the space of a year. Both predictionswere fulfilled.” The close relationship between Freemasonry and the originalKnights Templars has caused the story of CHiram to be linked with the martyrdomof Jacques de Molay. According to this interpretation, the three ruffians whocruelly slew their Master at the gates of the temple because he refused toreveal the secrets of his Order represent the Pope, the king, and theexecutioners. De Molay died maintaining his innocence and refusing to disclosethe philosophical and magical arcana of the Templars.Those who have sought to identify CHiram with the murdered King Charles theFirst conceive the Hiramic legend to have been invented for that purpose byElias Ashmole, a mystical philosopher, who was probably a member of theRosicrucian Fraternity Charles was dethroned in 1647 and died on the block in1649, leaving the Royalist party leaderless. An attempt has been made to relatethe term “the Sons of the Widow” (an appellation frequently applied to membersof the Masonic Order) to this incident in English history, for by the murder ofher king England became a Widow and all Englishmen Widow’s Sons.To the mystic Christian Mason, CHiram represents the Christ who in three days(degrees) raised the temple of His body from its earthly sepulcher. His threemurderers were Cæsar’s agent (the state), the Sanhedrin (the church), and theincited populace (the mob). Thus considered, CHiram becomes the higher nature ofman and the murderers are ignorance, superstition, and fear. The indwellingChrist can give expression to Himself in this world only through man’s thoughts,feelings, and actions. Right thinking, right feeling, and right action—these arethree gates through which the Christ power passes into the material world, thereto labor in the erection of the Temple of Universal Brotherhood. Ignorance,superstition, and fear are three ruffians through whose agencies the Spirit ofGood is murdered and a false kingdom, controlled by wrong thinking, wrongfeeling, and wrong action, established in its stead. In the material universeevil appears ever victorious.“In this sense,” writes Daniel Sickels, “the myth of the Tyrian is perpetuallyrepeated in the history of human affairs. Orpheus was murdered, and his bodythrown into the Hebrus; Socrates was made to drink the hemlock; and, in allages, we have seen Evil temporarily triumphant, and Virtue and Truthcalumniated, persecuted, crucified, and slain. But Eternal Justice marchessurely and swiftly through the world: the Typhons, the children of darkness, theplotters of crime, all the infinitely varied forms of evil, are swept intooblivion; and Truth and Virtue—for a time laid low—come forth, clothed withdiviner majesty, and crowned with everlasting glory!” (See General AhimanRezon.)If, as there is ample reason to suspect, the modern Freemasonic Order wasprofoundly influenced by, if it is not an actual outgrowth of, Francis Bacon’ssecret society, its symbolism is undoubtedly permeated with Bacon’s two greatideals: universal education and universal democracy. The deadly enemies ofuniversal education are ignorance, superstition, and fear, by which the humansoul is held in bondage to the lowest part of its own constitution. The arrantenemies of universal democracy have ever been the crown, the tiara, and thetorch. Thus CHiram symbolizes that ideal state of spiritual, intellectual, andphysical emancipation which has ever been sacrificed upon the altar of humanselfishness. CHiram is the Beautifier of the Eternal House. Modernutilitarianism, however, sacrifices the beautiful for the practical, in the samebreath declaring the obvious lie that selfishness, hatred, and discord arepractical.Dr. Orville Ward Owen found a considerable part of the first thirty-two degreesof Freemasonic ritualism hidden in the text of the First Shakespeare Folio.Masonic emblems are to be observed also upon the title pages of nearly everybook published by Bacon. Sir Francis Bacon considered himself as a livingsacrifice upon the altar of human need; he was obviously cut down in the midstof his labors, and no student of his New Atlantis can fail to recognize theMasonic symbolism contained therein. According to the observations of JosephFort Newton, the Temple of Solomon described by Bacon in that utopianromance was not a house at all but the name of an ideal state. Is it not truethat the Temple of Freemasonry is also emblematic of a condition of society?While, as before stated, the principles of the Hiramic legend are of thegreatest antiquity, it is not impossible that its present form may be based uponincidents in the life of Lord Bacon, who passed through the philosophic deathand was raised in GermanyIn an old manuscript appears the statement that the Freemasonic Order was formedby alchemists and Hermetic philosophers who had banded themselves together toprotect their secrets against the infamous methods used by avaricious persons towring from them the secret of gold-making. The fact that the Hiramic legendcontains an alchemical formula gives credence to this story. Thus the buildingof Solomon’s Temple represents the consummation of the magnum opus, which cannotbe realized without the assistance of CHiram, the Universal Agent. The MasonicMysteries teach the initiate how to prepare within his own soul a miraculouspowder of projection by which it is possible for him to transmute the base lumpof human ignorance, perversion, and discord into an ingot of spiritual andphilosophic gold.074 [images/00075.jpg] DIANA OF EPHESUS.Crowned with a triple tower-like tiara and her form adorned with symboliccreatures representative of her spiritual powers, Diana stood for the source ofthat imperishable doctrine which, flowing from the bosom of the GreatMultimammia, is the spiritual food of those aspiring men and women who haveconsecrated their lives to the contemplation of reality. As the physical body ofman receives its nutriment from the Great Earth Mother, so the spiritual natureof man is fed from the never-failing fountains of Truth pouring outward from theinvisible worlds. Sufficient similarity exists between the Masonic CHiram and the Kundalini ofHindu mysticism to warrant the assumption that CHiram may be considered a symbolalso of the Spirit Fire moving through the sixth ventricle of the spinal column.The exact science of human regeneration is the Lost Key of Masonry, for when theSpirit Fire is lifted up through the thirty-three degrees, or segments of thespinal column, and enters into the domed chamber of the human skull, it finallypasses into the pituitary body (Isis), where it invokes Ra (the pineal gland)and demands the Sacred Name. Operative Masonry, in the fullest meaning of thatterm, signifies the process by which the Eye of Horus is opened. E. A. WallisBudge has noted that in some of the papyri illustrating the entrance of thesouls of the dead into the judgment hall of Osiris the deceased person has apine cone attached to the crown of his head. The Greek mysteries also carried asymbolic staff, the upper end being in the form of a pine cone, which was calledthe thyrsus of Bacchus. In the human brain there is a tiny gland called thepineal body, which is the sacred eye of the ancients, and corresponds to thethird eye of the Cyclops. Little is known concerning the function of the pinealbody, which Descartes suggested (more wisely than he knew) might be the abode ofthe spirit of man. As its name signifies, the pineal gland is the sacred pinecone in man—the eye single, which cannot be opened until CHiram (the SpiritFire) is raised through the sacred seals which are called the Seven Churches inAsia.There is an Oriental painting which shows three sunbursts. One sunburst coversthe head, in the midst of which sits Brahma with four heads, his body amysterious dark color. The second sunburst—which covers the heart, solar plexus,and upper abdominal region—shows Vishnu sitting in the blossom of the lotus on acouch formed of the coils of the serpent of cosmic motion, its seven-hooded headforming a canopy over the god. The third sunburst is over the generative system,in the midst of which sits Shiva, his body a grayish white and the Ganges Riverflowing out of the crown of his head. This painting was the work of a Hindumystic who spent many years subtly concealing great philosophical principleswithin these figures. The Christian legends could be related also to the humanbody by the same method as the Oriental, for the arcane meanings hidden in theteachings of both schools are identical.As applied to Masonry, the three sunbursts represent the gates of the temple atwhich CHiram was struck, there being no gate in the north because the sun nevershines from the northern angle of the heavens. The north is the symbol of thephysical because of its relation to ice (crystallized water) and to the body(crystallized spirit). In man the light shines toward the north but never fromit, because the body has no light of its own but shines with the reflected gloryof the divine life-particles concealed within physical substance. For thisreason the moon is accepted as the symbol of man’s physical nature. CHiram isthe mysterious fiery, airy water which must be raised through the three grandcenters symbolized by the ladder with three rungs and the sunburst flowersmentioned in the description of the Hindu painting. It must also pass upward bymeans of the ladder of seven rungs—the seven plexuses proximate to the spine.The nine segments of the sacrum and coccyx are pierced by ten foramina, throughwhich pass the roots of the Tree of Life. Nine is the sacred number of man, andin the symbolism of the sacrum and coccyx a great mystery is concealed. Thatpart of the body from the kidneys downward was termed by the early Qabbaliststhe Land of Egypt into which the children of Israel were taken during thecaptivity. Out of Egypt, Moses (the illuminated mind, as his name implies) ledthe tribes of Israel (the twelve faculties) by raising the brazen serpent in thewilderness upon the symbol of the Tau cross. Not only CHiram but the god-men ofnearly every pagan Mystery ritual are personifications of the Spirit Fire in thehuman spinal cord.The astronomical aspect of the Hiramic legend must not be overlooked. Thetragedy of CHiram is enacted annually by the sun during its passage through thesigns of the zodiac.“From the journey of the Sun through the twelve signs,” writes Albert Pike,“come the legend of the twelve labors of Hercules, and the incarnations ofVishnu and Buddha. Hence came the legend of the murder of Khurum, representativeof the Sun, by the three Fellow-Crafts, symbols of the Winter signs,Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, who assailed him at the three gates of Heavenand slew him at the Winter Solstice. Hence the search for him by the nineFellow-Crafts, the other nine signs, his finding, burial, and resurrection.”(See Morals and Dogma. )Other authors consider Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius as the three murderers ofthe sun, inasmuch as Osiris was murdered by Typhon, to whom were assigned thethirty degrees of the constellation of Scorpio. In the Christian Mysteries alsoJudas signifies the Scorpion, and the thirty pieces of silver for which hebetrayed His Lord represent the number of degrees in that sign. Having beenstruck by Libra (the state), Scorpio (the church), and Sagittarius (the mob),the sun (CHiram) is secretly borne through the darkness by the signs ofCapricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces and buried over the brow of a hill (the vernalequinox). Capricorn has for its symbol an old man with a scythe in his hand.This is Father Time—a wayfarer—who is symbolized in Masonry as straightening outthe ringlets of a young girl’s hair. If the Weeping Virgin be considered asymbol of Virgo, and Father Time with his scythe a symbol of Capricorn, then theinterval of ninety degrees between these two signs will be found to correspondto that occupied by the three murderers. Esoterically, the urn containing theashes of CHiram represents the human heart. Saturn, the old man who lives at thenorth pole, and brings with him to the children of men a sprig of evergreen (theChristmas tree), is familiar to the little folks under the name of Santa Claus,for he brings each winter the gift of a new year.The martyred sun is discovered by Aries, a Fellow-Craftsman, and at the vernalequinox the process of raising him begins. This is finally accomplished by theLion ofJudah, who in ancient times occupied the position of the keystone of theRoyal Arch of Heaven. The precession of the equinoxes causes various signs toplay the role of the murderers of the sun during the different ages of theworld, but the principle involved remains unchanged. Such is the cosmic story ofCHiram, the Universal Benefactor, the Fiery Architect of the Divine House, whocarries with him to the grave that Lost Word which, when spoken, raises all lifeto power and glory. According to Christian mysticism, when the Lost Word isfound it is discovered in a stable, surrounded by beasts and marked by a star.“After the sun leaves Leo,” writes Robert Hewitt Brown, “the days begin to growunequivocally shorter as the sun declines toward the autumnal equinox, to beagain slain by the three autumnal months, lie dead through the three winterones, and be raised again by the three vernal ones. Each year the great tragedyis repeated, and the glorious resurrection takes place:“ (See Stellar Theologyand Masonic Astronomy.)CHiram is termed dead because in the average individual the cosmic creativeforces are limited in their manifestation to purely physical—and correspondinglymaterialistic—expression. Obsessed by his belief in the reality and permanenceof physical existence, man does not correlate the material universe with theblank north wall of the temple. As the solar light symbolically is said to dieas it approaches the winter solstice, so the physical world may be termed thewinter solstice of the spirit. Reaching the winter solstice, the sun apparentlystands still for three days and then, rolling away the stone of winter, beginsits triumphal march north towards the summer solstice. The condition ofignorance may be likened to the winter solstice of philosophy; spiritualunderstanding to the summer solstice. From this point of view, initiation intothe Mysteries becomes the vernal equinox of the spirit, at which time the CHiramin man crosses from the realm of mortality into that of eternal life. Theautumnal equinox is analogous to the mythological fall of man, at which time thehuman spirit descended into the realms of Hades by being immersed in theillusion of terrestrial existence.In An Essay on the Beautiful, Plotinus describes the refining effect of beautyupon the unfolding consciousness of man. Commissioned to decorate theEverlasting House, CHiram Abiff is the embodiment of the beautifying principle.Beauty is essential to the natural unfoldment of the human soul. The Mysteriesheld that man, in part at least, was the product of his environment. Thereforethey considered it imperative that every person be surrounded by objects whichwould evoke the highest and noblest sentiments. They proved that it was possibleto produce beauty in life by surrounding life with beauty They discovered thatsymmetrical bodies were built by souls continuously in the presence ofsymmetrical bodies; that noble thoughts were produced by minds surrounded byexamples of mental nobility Conversely, if a man were forced to look upon anignoble or asymmetrical structure it would arouse within him a sense of ignobil-ity which would provoke him to commit ignoble deeds. If an ill-proportionedbuilding were erected in the midst of a city there would be ill-proportionedchildren born in that community; and men and women, gazing upon the asymmetricalstructure, would live inharmonious lives. Thoughtful men of antiquity realizedthat their great philosophers were the natural products of the æsthetic idealsof architecture, music, and art established as the standards of the culturalsystems of die time.The substitution of the discord of the fantastic for the harmony of thebeautiful constitutes one of the great tragedies of every civilization. Not onlywere the Savior-Gods of the ancient world beautiful, but each performed aministry of beauty, seeking to effect man’s regeneration by arousing within himthe love of the beautiful. A renaissance of the golden age of fable can be madepossible only by the elevation of beauty to its rightful dignity as theall-pervading, idealizing quality in the religious, ethical, sociological,scientific, and political departments of life. The Dionysiac Architects wereconsecrated to the raising of their Master Spirit—Cosmic Beauty—from thesepulcher of material ignorance and selfishness by erecting buildings which weresuch perfect exemplars of symmetry and majesty that they were actually magicalformulae by which was evoked the spirit of the martyred Beautifier entombedwithin a materialistic world.In the Masonic Mysteries the triune spirit of man (the light Delta) issymbolized by the three Grand Masters of the Lodge of Jerusalem. As God is thepervading principle of three worlds, in each of which He manifests as an activeprinciple, so the spirit of man, partaking of the nature of Divinity, dwellsupon three planes of being: the Supreme, the Superior, and the Inferior spheresof the Pythagoreans. At the gate of the Inferior sphere (the underworld, ordwelling place of mortal creatures) stands the guardian of Hades—thethree-headed dog Cerberus, who is analogous to the three murderers of theHiramic legend. According to this symbolic interpretation of the triune spirit,CHiram is the third, or incarnating, part—the Master Builder who through allages erects living temples of flesh and blood as shrines of the Most High.CHiram comes forth as a flower and is cut down; he dies at the gates of matter;he is buried in the elements of creation, but—like Thor—he swings his mightyhammer in the fields of space, sets the primordial atoms in motion, andestablishes order out of Chaos. As the potentiality of cosmic power within eachhuman soul, CHiram lies waiting for man by the elaborate ritualism of life totransmute potentiality into divine potency. As the sense perceptions of theindividual increase, however, man gains ever greater control over his variousparts, and the spirit of life within gradually attains freedom. The threemurderers represent the laws of the Inferior world—birth, growth, anddecay—which ever frustrate the plan of the Builder. To the average individual,physical birth actually signifies the death of CHiram, and physical death theresurrection of CHiram. To the initiate, however, the resurrection of thespiritual nature is accomplished without the intervention of physical death.The curious symbols found in the base of Cleopatra’s Needle now standing inCentral Park, New York, were interpreted as being of first Masonic significanceby S. A. Zola, 33°, Past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Egypt. Masons’ marksand symbols are to be found on the stones of numerous public buildings not onlyin England and on the Continent but also in Asia. In his Indian Masons’ Marks ofthe Moghul Dynasty, A. Gorham describes scores of markings appearing on thewalls of buildings such as the Taj Mahal, the Jama Masjid, and that famousMasonic structure, the Kutab Minar. According to those who regard Masonry as anoutgrowth of the secret society of architects and builders which for thousandsof years formed a caste of master craftsmen, CHiram Abiff was the Tyrian GrandMaster of a world-wide organization of artisans, with headquarters in Tyre.Their philosophy consisted of incorporating into the measurements andornamentation of temples, palaces, mausoleums, fortresses, and other publicbuildings their knowledge of the laws controlling the universe. Every initiatedworkman was given a hieroglyphic with which he marked the stones he trued toshow to all posterity that he thus dedicated to the Supreme Architect of theUniverse each perfected product of his labor. Concerning Masons’ marks, RobertFreke Gould writes:“It is very remarkable that these marks are to be found in all countries—in thechambers of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, on the underground walls of Jerusalem,in Herculaneum and Pompeii, on Roman walls and Grecian temples, in Hindustan,Mexico, Peru, Asia Minor—as well as on the great ruins of England, France,Germany, Scotland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.” (See A Concise History ofFreemasonry. )From this viewpoint the story of CHiram may well represent the incorporation ofthe divine secrets of architecture into the actual parts and dimensions ofearthly buildings. The three degrees of the Craft bury the Grand Master (theGreat Arcanum) in the actual structure they erect, after first having killed himwith the builders’ tools, by reducing the dimensionless Spirit of Cosmic Beautyto the limitations of concrete form. These abstract ideals of architecture canbe resurrected, however, by the Master Mason who, by meditating upon thestructure, releases therefrom the divine principles of architectonic philosophyincorporated or buried within it. Thus the physical building is actually thetomb or embodiment of the Creative Ideal of which its material dimensions arebut the shadow.Moreover, the Hiramic legend may be considered to embody the vicissitudes ofphilosophy itself. As institutions for the dissemination of ethical culture, thepagan Mysteries were the architects of civilization. Their power and dignitywere personified in CHiram Abiff—the Master Builder—but they eventually fell avictim to the onslaughts of that recurrent trio of state, church, and mob. Theywere desecrated by the state, jealous of their wealth and power; by the earlychurch, fearful of their wisdom; and by the rabble or soldiery incited by bothstate and church. As CHiram when raised from his grave whispers the MasterMason’s Word which was lost through his untimely death, so according to thetenets of philosophy the reestablishment or resurrection of the ancientMysteries will result in the rediscovery of that secret teaching without whichcivilization must continue in a state of spiritual confusion and uncertainty.When the mob governs, man is ruled by ignorance; when the church governs, he isruled by superstition; and when the state governs, he is ruled by fear. Beforemen can live together in harmony and understanding, ignorance must be transmutedinto wisdom, superstition into an illumined faith, and fear into love. Despitestatements to the contrary, Masonry is a religion seeking to unite God and manby elevating its initiates to that level of consciousness whereon they canbehold with clarified vision the workings of the Great Architect of theUniverse. From age to age the vision of a perfect civilization is preserved asthe ideal for mankind. In the midst of that civilization shall stand a mightyuniversity wherein both the sacred and secular sciences concerning the mysteriesof life will be freely taught to all who will assume the philosophic life. Herecreed and dogma will have no place; the superficial will be removed and only theessential be preserved. The world will be ruled by its most illumined minds, andeach will occupy the position for which he is most admirably fitted.The great university will be divided into grades, admission to which will bethrough preliminary tests or initiations. Here mankind will be instructed in themost sacred, the most secret, and the most enduring of all Mysteries—Symbolism.Here the initiate will be taught that every visible object, every abstractthought, every emotional reaction is but the symbol of an eternal principle.Here mankind will learn that CHiram (Truth) lies buried in every atom of Kosmos;that every form is a symbol and every symbol the tomb of an eternal verityThrough education—spiritual, mental, moral, and physical—man will learn torelease living truths from their lifeless coverings. The perfect government ofthe earth must be patterned eventually after that divine government by which theuniverse is ordered. In that day when perfect order is reestablished, with peaceuniversal and good triumphant, men will no longer seek for happiness, for theyshall find it welling up within themselves. Dead hopes, dead aspirations, deadvirtues shall rise from their graves, and the Spirit of Beauty and Goodnessrepeatedly slain by ignorant men shall again be the Master of Work. Then shallsages sit upon the seats of the mighty and the gods walk with men."},{"pageContent":"XVII The Pythagorean Theory of Music and Color Harmony is a state recognized by great philosophers as the immediateprerequisite of beauty A compound is termed beautiful only when its parts are inharmonious combination.The world is called beautiful and its Creator is designated the Good becausegood perforce must act in conformity with its own nature; and good actingaccording to its own nature is harmony, because the good which it accomplishesis harmonious with the good which it is. Beauty, therefore, is harmonymanifesting its own intrinsic nature in the world of form.The universe is made up of successive gradations of good, these gradationsascending from matter (which is the least degree of good) to spirit (which isthe greatest degree of good). In man, his superior nature is the summum bonum.It therefore follows that his highest nature most readily cognizes good, becausethe good external to him in the world is in harmonic ratio with the good presentin his soul. What man terms evil is therefore, in common with matter, merely theleast degree of its own opposite. The least degree of good presupposes likewisethe least degree of harmony and beauty. Thus deformity (evil) is really theleast harmonious combination of elements naturally harmonic as individual units.Deformity is unnatural, for, the sum of all things being the Good, it is naturalthat all things should partake of the Good and be arranged in combinations thatare harmonious. Harmony is the manifesting expression of the Will of the eternalGood."},{"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY OF MUSIC It is highly probable that the Greek initiates gained their knowledge of thephilosophic and therapeutic aspects of music from the Egyptians, who, in turn,considered Hermes the founder of the art. According to one legend, this godconstructed the first lyre by stretching strings across the concavity of aturtle shell. Both Isis and Osiris were patrons of music and poetry. Plato, indescribing the antiquity of these arts among the Egyptians, declared that songsand poetry had existed in Egypt for at least ten thousand years, and that thesewere of such an exalted and inspiring nature that only gods or godlike men couldhave composed them. In the Mysteries the lyre was regarded as the secret symbolof the human constitution, the body of the instrument representing the physicalform, the strings the nerves, and the musician the spirit. Playing upon thenerves, the spirit thus created the harmonies of normal functioning, which,however, became discords if the nature of man were defiled.075 [images/00076.jpg] THE INTERVALS AND HARMONIES OF THE SPHERES.In Pythagorean concept of the music of the spheres, the interval between theearth and the sphere of the fixed stars was considered to be a diapason—the mostperfect harmonic interval. The following arangement is most generally acceptedfor the musical intervals of the planets between the earth and the sphere of thefixed stars: From the sphere of the earth to the sphere of the moon, one tone;from the sphere of the moon to that of Mercury, one-half tone; from Mercury toVenus, one-half tone; from Venus to the sun, one and one-half tones; from thesun to Mars, one tone; from Mars to Jupiter, one-half tone; from Jupiter toSaturn, one-half tone; from Saturn to the fixed stars, one-half tone. The sum ofthese intervals equals the six whole tones of the octave. While the early Chinese, Hindus, Persians, Egyptians, Israelites, and Greeksemployed both vocal and instrumental music in their religious ceremonials, alsoto complement their poetry and drama, it remained for Pythagoras to raise theart to its true dignity by demonstrating its mathematical foundation. Althoughit is said that he himself was not a musician, Pythagoras is now generallycredited with the discovery of the diatonic scale. Having first learned thedivine theory of music from the priests of the various Mysteries into which hehad been accepted, Pythagoras pondered for several years upon the laws governingconsonance and dissonance. How he actually solved the problem is unknown, butthe following explanation has been invented.One day while meditating upon the problem of harmony, Pythagoras chanced to passa brazier’s shop where workmen were pounding out a piece of metal upon an anvil.By noting the variances in pitch between the sounds made by large hammers andthose made by smaller implements, and carefully estimating the harmonies anddiscords resulting from combinations of these sounds, he gained his first clueto the musical intervals of the diatonic scale. He entered the shop, and aftercarefully examining the tools and making mental note of their weights, returnedto his own house and constructed an arm of wood so that it extended out from thewall of his room. At regular intervals along this arm he attached four cords,all of like composition, size, and weight. To the first of these he attached atwelve-pound weight, to the second a nine-pound weight, to the third aneight-pound weight, and to the fourth a six-pound weight. These differentweights corresponded to the sizes of the braziers’ hammers.Pythagoras thereupon discovered that the first and fourth strings when soundedtogether produced the harmonic interval of the octave, for doubling the weighthad the same effect as halving the string. The tension of the first string beingtwice that of the fourth string, their ratio was said to be 2:1, or duple. Bysimilar experimentation he ascertained that the first and third string producedthe harmony of the diapente, or the interval of the fifth. The tension of thefirst string being half again as much as that of the third string, their ratiowas said to be 3:2, or sesquialter. Likewise the second and fourth strings,having the same ratio as the first and third strings, yielded a diapenteharmony. Continuing his investigation, Pythagoras discovered that the first andsecond strings produced the harmony of the diatessaron, or the interval of thethird; and the tension of the first string being a third greater than that ofthe second string, their ratio was said to be 4:3, or sesquitertian. The thirdand fourth strings, having the same ratio as the first and second strings,produced another harmony of the diatessaron. According to lamblichus, the secondand third strings had the ratio of 8:9, or epogdoan.The key to harmonic ratios is hidden in the famous Pythagorean tetractys, orpyramid of dots. The tetractys is made up of the first four numbers—1, 2, 3, and4—which in their proportions reveal the intervals of the octave, the diapente,and the diatessaron. While the law of harmonic intervals as set forth above istrue, it has been subsequently proved that hammers striking metal in the mannerdescribed will not produce the various tones ascribed to them. In allprobability, therefore, Pythagoras actually worked out his theory of harmonyfrom the monochord—a contrivance consisting of a single string stretched betweentwo pegs and supplied with movable frets.To Pythagoras music was one of the dependencies of the divine science ofmathematics, and its harmonies were inflexibly controlled by mathematicalproportions. The Pythagoreans averred that mathematics demonstrated the exactmethod by which the Good established and maintained its universe. Numbertherefore preceded harmony, since it was the immutable law that governs allharmonic proportions. After discovering these harmonic ratios, Pythagorasgradually initiated his disciples into this, the supreme arcanum of hisMysteries. He divided the multitudinous parts of creation into a vast number ofplanes or spheres, to each of which he assigned a tone, a harmonic interval, anumber, a name, a color, and a form. He then proceeded to prove the accuracy ofhis deductions by demonstrating them upon the different planes of intelligenceand substance ranging from the most abstract logical premise to the mostconcrete geometrical solid. From the common agreement of these diversifiedmethods of proof he established the indisputable existence of certain naturallaws.Having once established music as an exact science, Pythagoras applied his newlyfound law of harmonic intervals to all the phenomena of Nature, even going sofar as to demonstrate the harmonic relationship of the planets, constellations,and elements to each other. A notable example of modern corroboration of ancientphilosophical teaching is that of the progression of the elements according toharmonic ratios. While making a list of the elements in the ascending order oftheir atomic weights, John A. Newlands discovered at every eighth element adistinct repetition of properties. This discovery is known as the law of octavesin modern chemistry.Since they held that harmony must be determined not by the sense perceptions butby reason and mathematics, the Pythagoreans called themselves Canonics, asdistinguished from musicians of the Harmonic School, who asserted taste andinstinct to be the true normative principles of harmony. Recognizing, however,the profound effect of music upon the senses and emotions, Pythagoras did nothesitate to influence the mind and body with what he termed “musical medicine.”Pythagoras evinced such a marked preference for stringed instruments that heeven went so far as to warn his disciples against allowing their ears to bedefiled by the sounds of flutes or cymbals. He further declared that the soulcould be purified from its irrational influences by solemn songs sung to theaccompaniment of the lyre. In his investigation of the therapeutic value ofharmonics, Pythagoras discovered that the seven modes—or keys—of the Greeksystem of music had the power to incite or allay the various emotions. It isrelated that while observing the stars one night he encountered a young manbefuddled with strong drink and mad with jealousy who was piling faggots abouthis mistress’ door with the intention of burning the house. The frenzy of theyouth was accentuated by a flutist a short distance away who was playing a tunein the stirring Phrygian mode. Pythagoras induced the musician to change his airto the slow and rhythmic Spondaic mode, whereupon the intoxicated youthimmediately became composed and, gathering up his bundles of wood, returnedquietly to his own home.There is also an account of how Empedocles, a disciple of Pythagoras, by quicklychanging the mode of a musical composition he was playing, saved the life of hishost, Anchitus, when the latter was threatened with death by the sword of onewhose father he had condemned to public execution. It is also known thatEsculapius, the Greek physician, cured sciatica and other diseases of the nervesby blowing a loud trumpet in the presence of the patient.Pythagoras cured many ailments of the spirit, soul, and body by having certainspecially prepared musical compositions played in the presence of the suffereror by personally reciting short selections from such early poets as Hesiod andHomer. In his university at Crotona it was customary for the Pythagoreans toopen and to close each day with songs—those in the morning calculated to clearthe mind from sleep and inspire it to the activities of the coming day; those inthe evening of a mode soothing, relaxing, and conducive to rest. At the vernalequinox, Pythagoras caused his disciples to gather in a circle around one oftheir number who led them in song and played their accompaniment upon a lyre.The therapeutic music of Pythagoras is described by Iamblichus thus: “And thereare certain melodies devised as remedies against the passions of the soul, andalso against despondency and lamentation, which Pythagoras invented as thingsthat afford the greatest assistance in these maladies. And again, he employedother melodies against rage and anger, and against every aberration of the soul.There is also another kind of modulation invented as a remedy against desires.”(See The Life of Pythagoras.)It is probable that the Pythagoreans recognized a connection between the SevenGreek modes and the planets. As an example, Pliny declares that Saturn moves inthe Dorian mode and Jupiter in the Phrygian mode. It is also apparent that thetemperaments are keyed to the various modes, and the passions likewise. Thus,anger—which is a fiery passion—may be accentuated by a fiery mode or its powerneutralized by a watery mode.The far-reaching effect exercised by music upon the culture of the Greeks isthus summed up by Emil Nauman: “Plato depreciated the notion that music wasintended solely to create cheerful and agreeable emotions, maintaining ratherthat it should inculcate a love of all that is noble, and hatred of all that ismean, and that nothing could more strongly influence man’s innermost feelingsthan melody and rhythm. Firmly convinced of this, he agreed with Damon ofAthens, the musical instructor of Socrates, that the introduction of a new andpresumably enervating scale would endanger the future of a whole nation, andthat it was not possible to alter a key without shaking the very foundations ofthe State. Plato affirmed that music which ennobled the mind was of a far higherkind than that which merely appealed to the senses, and he strongly insistedthat it was the paramount duty of the Legislature to suppress all music of aneffeminate and lascivious character, and to encourage only that which was pureand dignified; that bold and stirring melodies were for men, gentle and soothingones for women. From this it is evident that music played a considerable part inthe education of the Greek youth. The greatest care was also to be taken in theselection of instrumental music, because the absence of words rendered itssignification doubtful, and it was difficult to foresee whether it wouldexercise upon the people a benign or baneful influence. Popular taste, beingalways tickled by sensuous and meretricious effects, was to be treated withdeserved contempt.” (See The History of Music.)Even today martial music is used with telling effect in times of war, andreligious music, while no longer developed in accordance with the ancienttheory, still profoundly influences the emotions of the laity."},{"pageContent":"THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES The most sublime but least known of all the Pythagorean speculations was that ofsidereal harmonics. It was said that of all men only Pythagoras heard the musicof the spheres. Apparently the Chaldeans were the first people to conceive ofthe heavenly bodies joining in a cosmic chant as they moved in stately manneracross the sky. Job describes a time “when the stars of the morning sangtogether,” and in The Merchant of Venice the author of the Shakesperian playswrites: “There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st but in his motionlike an angel sings.” So little remains, however, of the Pythagorean system ofcelestial music that it is only possible to approximate his actual theory.Pythagoras conceived the universe to be an immense monochord, with its singlestring connected at its upper end to absolute spirit and at its lower end toabsolute matter—in other words, a cord stretched between heaven and earth.Counting inward from the circumference of the heavens, Pythagoras, according tosome authorities, divided the universe into nine parts; according to others,into twelve parts. The twelvefold system was as follows: The first division wascalled the empyrean, or the sphere of the fixed stars, and was the dwellingplace of the immortals. The second to twelfth divisions were (in order) thespheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon, andfire, air, water, and earth. This arrangement of the seven planets (the sun andmoon being regarded as planets in the old astronomy) is identical with thecandlestick symbolism of the Jews—the sun in the center as the main stem withthree planets on either side of it.The names given by the Pythagoreans to the various notes of the diatonic scalewere, according to Macrobius, derived from an estimation of the velocity andmagnitude of the planetary bodies. Each of these gigantic spheres as it rushedendlessly through space was believed to sound a certain tone caused by itscontinuous displacement of the œthereal diffusion. As these tones were amanifestation of divine order and motion, it must necessarily follow that theypartook of the harmony of their own source. “The assertion that the planets intheir revolutions round the earth uttered certain sounds differing according totheir respective ‘magnitude, celerity and local distance,’ was commonly made bythe Greeks. Thus Saturn, the farthest planet, was said to give the gravest note,while the Moon, which is the nearest, gave the sharpest. ‘These sounds of theseven planets, and the sphere of the fixed stars, together with that above us[Antichthon], are the nine Muses, and their joint symphony is calledMnemosyne.”’ (See The Canon.) This quotation contains an obscure reference tothe ninefold division of the universe previously mentioned.The Greek initiates also recognized a fundamental relationship between theindividual heavens or spheres of the seven planets, and the seven sacred vowels.The first heaven uttered the sound of the sacred vowel A (Alpha); the secondheaven, the sacred vowel E (Epsilon); the third, H (Eta); the fourth, I (lota);the fifth, O (Omicron); the sixth, Y (Upsilon); and the seventh heaven, thesacred vowel Ω (Omega). When these seven heavens sing together they produce aperfect harmony which ascends as an everlasting praise to the throne of theCreator. (See Irenæus’ Against Heresies.) Although not so stated, it is probablethat the planetary heavens are to be considered as ascending in the Pythagoreanorder, beginning with the sphere of the moon, which would be the first heaven.Many early instruments had seven strings, and it is generally conceded thatPythagoras was the one who added the eighth string to the lyre of Terpander. Theseven strings were always related both to their correspondences in the humanbody and to the planets. The names of God were also conceived to be formed fromcombinations of the seven planetary harmonies. The Egyptians confirmed theirsacred songs to the seven primary sounds, forbidding any others to be uttered intheir temples. One of their hymns contained the following invocation: “The sevensounding tones praise Thee, the Great God, the ceaseless working Father of thewhole universe.” In another the Deity describes Himself thus: “I am the greatindestructible lyre of the whole world, attuning the songs of the heavens.” (SeeNauman’s History of Music.)The Pythagoreans believed that everything which existed had a voice and that allcreatures were eternally singing the praise of the Creator. Man fails to hearthese divine melodies because his soul is enmeshed in the illusion of materialexistence. When he liberates himself from the bondage of the lower world withits sense limitations, the music of the spheres will again be audible as it wasin the Golden Age. Harmony recognizes harmony, and when the human soul regainsits true estate it will not only hear the celestial choir but also join with itin an everlasting anthem of praise to that Eternal Good controlling the infinitenumber of parts and conditions of Being.The Greek Mysteries included in their doctrines a magnificent concept of therelationship existing between music and form. The elements of architecture, forexample, were considered as comparable to musical modes and notes, or as havinga musical counterpart. Consequently when a building was erected in which anumber of these elements were combined, the structure was then likened to amusical chord, which was harmonic only when it fully satisfied the mathematicalrequirements of harmonic intervals. The realization of this analogy betweensound and form led Goethe to declare that “architecture is crystallized music.”In constructing their temples of initiation, the early priests frequentlydemonstrated their superior knowledge of the principles underlying the phenomenaknown as vibration. A considerable part of the Mystery rituals consisted ofinvocations and intonements, for which purpose special sound chambers wereconstructed. A word whispered in one of these apartments was so intensified thatthe reverberations made the entire building sway and be filled with a deafeningroar. The very wood and stone used in the erection of these sacred buildingseventually became so thoroughly permeated with the sound vibrations of thereligious ceremonies that when struck they would reproduce the same tones thusrepeatedly impressed into their substances by the rituals.Every element in Nature has its individual keynote. If these elements arecombined in a composite structure the result is a chord that, if sounded, willdisintegrate the compound into its integral parts. Likewise each individual hasa keynote that, if sounded, will destroy him. The allegory of the walls ofJericho falling when the trumpets of Israel were sounded is undoubtedly intendedto set forth the arcane significance of individual keynote or vibration."},{"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY OF COLOR “Light,” writes Edwin D. Babbitt, “reveals the glories of the external world andyet is the most glorious of them all. It gives beauty, reveals beauty and isitself most beautiful. It is the analyzer, the truth-teller and the exposer ofshams, for it shows things as they are. Its infinite streams measure off theuniverse and flow into our telescopes from stars which are quintillions of milesdistant. On the other hand it descends to objects inconceivably small, andreveals through the microscope objects fifty millions of times less than can beseen by the naked eye. Like all other fine forces, its movement is wonderfullysoft, yet penetrating and powerful. Without its vivifying influence, vegetable,animal, and human life must immediately perish from the earth, and general ruintake place. We shall do well, then, to consider this potential and beautifulprinciple of light and its component colors, for the more deeply we penetrateinto its inner laws, the more will it present itself as a marvelous storehouseof power to vitalize, heal, refine, and delight mankind.” (See The Principles ofLight and Color.)Since light is the basic physical manifestation of life, bathing all creation inits radiance, it is highly important to realize, in part at least, the subtlenature of this divine substance. That which is called light is actually a rateof vibration causing certain reactions upon the optic nerve. Few realize howthey are walled in by the limitations of the sense perceptions. Not only isthere a great deal more to light than anyone has ever seen but there are alsounknown forms of light which no optical equipment will ever register. There areunnumbered colors which cannot be seen, as well as sounds which cannot be heard,odors which cannot be smelt, flavors which cannot be tasted, and substanceswhich cannot be felt. Man is thus surrounded by a supersensible universe ofwhich he knows nothing because the centers of sense perception within himselfhave not been developed sufficiently to respond to the subtler rates ofvibration of which that universe is composed.Among both civilized and savage peoples color has been accepted as a naturallanguage in which to couch their religious and philosophical doctrines. Theancient city of Ecbatana as described by Herodotus, its seven walls coloredaccording to the seven planets, revealed the knowledge of this subject possessedby the Persian Magi. The famous zikkurat or astronomical tower of the god Neboat Borsippa ascended in seven great steps or stages, each step being painted inthe key color of one of the planetary bodies. (See Lenormant’s Chaldean Magic.)It is thus evident that the Babylonians were familiar with the concept of thespectrum in its relation to the seven Creative Gods or Powers. In India, one ofthe Mogul emperors caused a fountain to be made with seven levels. The waterpouring down the sides through specially arranged channels changed color as itdescended, passing sequentially through all shades of the spectrum. In Tibet,color is employed by the native artists to express various moods. L. AustineWaddell, writing of Northern Buddhist art, notes that in Tibetan mythology“White and yellow complexions usually typify mild moods, while the red, blue,and black belong to fierce forms, though sometimes light blue, as indicating thesky, means merely celestial. Generally the gods are pictured white, goblins red,and devils black, like their European relative.” (See The Buddhism of Tibet.)In Meno, Plato, speaking through Socrates, describes color as “an effluence ofform, commensurate with sight, and sensible.” In Theœtetus he discourses more atlength on the subject thus: “Let us carry out the principle which has just beenaffirmed, that nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that every color,white, black, and every other color, arises out of the eye meeting theappropriate motion, and that what we term the substance of each color is neitherthe active nor the passive element, but something which passes between them, andis peculiar to each percipient; are you certain that the several colors appearto every animal—say a dog—as they appear to you?”In the Pythagorean tetractys—the supreme symbol of universal forces andprocesses—are set forth the theories of the Greeks concerning color and music.The first three dots represent the threefold White Light, which is the Godheadcontaining potentially all sound and color. The remaining seven dots are thecolors of the spectrum and the notes of the musical scale. The colors and tonesare the active creative powers which, emanating from the First Cause, establishthe universe. The seven are divided into two groups, one containing three powersand the other four—a relationship also shown in the tetractys. The highergroup—that of three—becomes the spiritual nature of the created universe; thelower group—that of four—manifests as the irrational sphere, or inferior world.In the Mysteries the seven Logi, or Creative Lords, are shown as streams offorce issuing from the mouth of the Eternal One. This signifies the spectrumbeing extracted from the white light of the Supreme Deity. The seven Creators,or Fabricators, of the inferior spheres were called by the Jews the Elohim. Bythe Egyptians they were referred to as the Builders (sometimes as the Governors)and are depicted with great knives in their hands with which they carved theuniverse from its primordial substance. Worship of the planets is based upontheir acceptation as the cosmic embodiments of the seven creative attributes ofGod. The Lords of the planets were described as dwelling within the body of thesun, for the true nature of the sun, being analogous to the white light,contains the seeds of all the tone and color potencies which it manifests.There are numerous arbitrary arrangements setting forth the mutual relationshipsof the planets, the colors, and the musical notes. The most satisfactory systemis that based upon the law of the octave. The sense of hearing has a much widerscope than that of sight, for whereas the ear can register from nine to elevenoctaves of sound the eye is restricted to the cognition of but seven fundamentalcolor tones, or one tone short of the octave. Red, when posited as the lowestcolor tone in the sale of chromatics, thus corresponds to do, the first note ofthe musical scale. Continuing the analogy, orange corresponds to re, yellow tomi, green to fa, blue to sol, indigo to la, and violet to si (ti). The eighthcolor tone necessary to complete the scale should be the higher octave of red,the first color tone. The accuracy of the above arrangement is attested by twostriking facts: (1) the three fundamental notes of the musical scale—the first,the third, and the fifth-correspond with the three primary colors—red, yellow,and blue; (2) the seventh, and least perfect, note of the musical scalecorresponds with purple, the least perfect tone of the color scale.In The Principles of Light and Color, Edwin D. Babbitt confirms thecorrespondence of the color and musical scales: “As C is at the bottom of themusical scale and made with the coarsest waves of air, so is red at the bottomof the chromatic scale and made with the coarsest waves of luminous ether. Asthe musical note B [the seventh note of the scale] requires 45 vibrations of airevery time the note C at the lower end of the scale requires 24, or but littleover half as many, so does extreme violet require about 800 trillions ofvibrations of ether in a second, while extreme red requires only about 450trillions, which also are but little more than half as many. When one musicaloctave is finished another one commences and progresses with just twice as manyvibrations as were used in the first octave, and so the same notes are repeatedon a finer scale. In the same way when the scale of colors visible to theordinary eye is completed in the violet, another octave of finer invisiblecolors, with just twice as many vibrations, will commence and progress onprecisely the same law.”When the colors are related to the twelve signs of the zodiac, they are arrangedas the spokes of a wheel. To Aries is assigned pure red; to Taurus, red-orange;to Gemini, pure orange; to Cancer, orange-yellow; to Leo, pure yellow; to Virgo,yellow-green; to Libra, pure green; to Scorpio, green-blue; to Sagittarius, pureblue; to Capricorn, blue-violet; to Aquarius, pure violet; and to Pisces,violet-red.In expounding the Eastern system of esoteric philosophy, H. P. Blavatsky relatesthe colors to the septenary constitution of man and the seven states of matteras follows:076 [images/00077.jpg] This arrangement of the colors of the spectrum and the musical notes of theoctave necessitates a different grouping of the planets in order to preservetheir proper tone and color analogies. Thus do becomes Mars; re, the sun; mi,Mercury; fa, Saturn; sol, Jupiter; la, Venus; si (ti) the moon. (See The E. S.Instructions.)"},{"pageContent":"XVIII Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles, and Birds . PART I The creatures inhabiting the water, air, and earth were held in veneration byall races of antiquity. Realizing that visible bodies are only symbols ofinvisible forces, the ancients worshiped the Divine Power through the lowerkingdoms of Nature, because those less evolved and more simply constitutedcreatures responded most readily to the creative impulses of the gods. The sagesof old studied living things to a point of realization that God is mostperfectly understood through a knowledge of His supreme handiwork—animate andinanimate Nature.Every existing creature manifests some aspect of the intelligence or power ofthe Eternal One, who can never be known save through a study and appreciation ofHis numbered but inconceivable parts. When a creature is chosen, therefore, tosymbolize to the concrete human mind some concealed abstract principle it isbecause its characteristics demonstrate this invisible principle in visibleaction. Fishes, insects, animals, reptiles, and birds appear in the religioussymbolism of nearly all nations, because the forms and habits of these creaturesand the media in which they exist closely relate them to the various generativeand germinative powers of Nature, which were considered as prima-facie evidenceof divine omnipresence.The early philosophers and scientists, realizing that all life has its origin inwater, chose the fish as the symbol of the life germ. The fact that fishes aremost prolific makes the simile still more apt. While the early priests may nothave possessed the instruments necessary to analyze the spermatozoon, theyconcluded by deduction that it resembled a fish.Fishes were sacred to the Greeks and Romans, being connected with the worship ofAphrodite (Venus). An interesting survival of pagan ritualism is found in thecustom of eating fish on Friday. Freya, in whose honor the day was named, wasthe Scandinavian Venus, and this day was sacred among many nations to thegoddess of beauty and fecundity. This analogy further links the fish with theprocreative mystery. Friday is also sacred to the followers of the ProphetMohammed.077 [images/00078.jpg] THE FIRST INCARNATION, OR MATSYA AVATAR, OF VISHNU.The fish has often been associated with the World Saviors. Vishnu, the HinduRedeemer, who takes upon himself ten forms for the redemption of the universe,was expelled from the mouth of a fish in his first incarnation. Isis, whilenursing the infant Horus, is often shown with a fish on her headdress. Oannes,the Chaldean Savior (borrowed from the Brahmins), is depicted with the head andbody of a fish, from which his human form protrudes at various points. Jesus wasoften symbolized by a fish. He told His disciples that they should become“fishers of men.” The sign of the fish was also the first monogram of theChristians. The mysterious Greek name of Jesus, IXθYΣ, means “a fish.” The fishwas accepted as a symbol of the Christ by a number of early canonized churchfathers. St. Augustine likened the Christ to a fish that had been broiled, andit was also pointed out that the flesh of that Fish was the food of righteousand holy men. The word nun means both fish and growth, and as Inman says: “The Jews were ledto victory by the Son of the Fish whose other names were Joshua and Jesus (theSavior). Nun is still the name of a female devotee” of the Christian faith.Among early Christians three fishes were used to symbolize the Trinity, and thefish is also one of the eight sacred symbols of the great Buddha. It is alsosignificant that the dolphin should be sacred to both Apollo (the Solar Savior)and Neptune. It was believed that this fish carried shipwrecked sailors toheaven on its back. The dolphin was accepted by the early Christians as anemblem of Christ, because the pagans had viewed this beautiful creature as afriend and benefactor of man. The heir to the throne of France, the Dauphin, mayhave secured his title from this ancient pagan symbol of the divine preservativepower. The first advocates of Christianity likened converts to fishes, who atthe time of baptism “returned again into the sea of Christ.”Primitive peoples believed the sea and land were inhabited by strange creatures,and early books on zoology contain curious illustrations of composite beasts,reptiles, and fishes, which did not exist at the time the mediaeval authorscompiled these voluminous books. In the ancient initiatory rituals of thePersian, Greek, and Egyptian Mysteries the priests disguised themselves ascomposite creatures, thereby symbolizing different aspects of humanconsciousness. They used birds and reptiles as emblems of their various deities,often creating forms of grotesque appearance and assigning to them imaginarytraits, habits, and places of domicile, all of which were symbolic of certainspiritual and transcendental truths thus concealed from the profane. The Phœnixmade its nest of incense and flames. The unicorn had the body of a horse, thefeet of an elephant, and the tail of a wild boar. The upper half of thecentaur’s body was human and the lower half equine. The pelican of theHermetists fed its young from its own breast, and to this bird were assignedother mysterious attributes which could have been true only allegorically.Though regarded by many writers of die Middle Ages as actual living creatures,none of these—the pelican excepted—ever existed outside the symbolism of theMysteries. Possibly they originated in rumors of animals then little known. Inthe temple, however, they became a reality, for there they signified themanifold characteristics of man’s nature. The mantichora had certain points incommon with the hyena; the unicorn may have been the single-horned rhinoceros.To the student of the secret wisdom these composite animals and birds simplyrepresent various forces working in the invisible worlds. This is a point whichnearly all writers on the subject of mediævel monsters seem to have overlooked.(See Vlyssis Aldrovandi’s Monstrorum Historia, 1642, and Physica Curiosa, by P.Gaspare Schotto, 1697.)There are also legends to the effect that long before the appearance of humanbeings there existed a race or species of composite creatures which wasdestroyed by the gods. The temples of antiquity preserved their own historicalrecords and possessed information concerning the prehistoric world that hasnever been revealed to the uninitiated. According to these records, the humanrace evolved from a species of creature that partook somewhat of the nature ofan amphibian, for at that time primitive man had the gills of a fish and waspartly covered with scales. To a limited degree, the human embryo demonstratesthe possibility of such a condition. As a result of the theory of man’s originin water, the fish was looked upon as the progenitor of the human family. Thisgave rise to the ichthyolatry of the Chaldeans, Phœnicians, and Brahmins. TheAmerican Indians believe that the waters of lakes, rivers, and oceans areinhabited by a mysterious people, the “Water Indians.”The fish has been used as an emblem of damnation; but among the Chinese ittypified contentment and good fortune, and fishes appear on many of their coins.When Typhon, or Set, the Egyptian evil genius, had divided the body of the godOsiris into fourteen parts, he cast one part into the river Nile, where,according to Plutarch, it was devoured by three fishes—the lepidotus (probablythe lepidosiren), the phagrus, and the oxyrynchus (a form of pike). For thisreason the Egyptians would not eat the flesh of these fishes, believing that todo so would be to devour the body of their god. When used as a symbol of evil,the fish represented the earth (man’s lower nature) and the tomb (the sepulcherof the Mysteries). Thus was Jonah three days in the belly of the “great fish,”as Christ was three days in the tomb.Several early church fathers believed that the “whale” which swallowed Jonah wasthe symbol of God the Father, who, when the hapless prophet was thrownoverboard, accepted Jonah into His own nature until a place of safety wasreached. The story of Jonah is really a legend of initiation into the Mysteries,and the “great fish” represents the darkness of ignorance which engulfs man whenhe is thrown over the side of the ship (is born) into the sea (life). The customof building ships in the form of fishes or birds, common in ancient times, couldgive rise to the story, and mayhap Jonah was merely picked up by another vesseland carried into port, the pattern of the ship causing it to be called a “greatfish.” (“Veritatis simplex oratio est!”) More probably the “whale” of Jonah isbased upon the pagan mythological creature, hippocampus, part horse and partdolphin, for the early Christian statues and carvings show the compositecreature and not a true whale.It is reasonable to suppose that the mysterious sea serpents which, according tothe Mayan and Toltec legends, brought the gods to Mexico were Viking or Chaldeanships, built in the shape of composite sea monsters or dragons. H. P. Blavatskyadvances the theory that the word cetus, the great whale, is derived from keto,a name for the fish god, Dagon, and that Jonah was actually confined in a cellhollowed out in the body of a gigantic statue of Dagon after he had beencaptured by Phœnician sailors and carried to one of their cities. There is nodoubt a great mystery in the gigantic form of cetus, which is still preserved asa constellation.According to many scattered fragments extant, man’s lower nature was symbolizedby a tremendous, awkward creature resembling a great sea-serpent, or dragon,called leviathan. All symbols having serpentine form or motion signify the solarenergy in one of its many forms. This great creature of the sea thereforerepresents the solar life force imprisoned in water and also the divine energycoursing through the body of man, where, until transmuted, it manifests itselfas a writhing, twisting monster—man’s greeds, passions, and lusts. Among thesymbols of Christ as the Savior of men are a number relating to the mystery ofHis divine nature concealed within the personality of the lowly Jesus.078 [images/00079.jpg] THE MANTICHORA.The most remarkable of allegorical creatures was the mantichora. which Ctesiasdescribes as having a flame-colored body, lionlike in shape, three rows ofteeth, a human head and ears, blue eyes, a tail ending in a series of spikes andstings, thorny and scorpiontike, and a voice which sounded like the blare oftrumpets. This synthetic quadruped ambled into mediæval works on naturalhistory, but. though seriously considered, had never been seen, because itinhabited inaccessible regions and consequently was difficult to locate. The Gnostics divided the nature of the Christian Redeemer into two parts—the oneJesus, a mortal man; the other, Christos, a personification of Nous, theprinciple of Cosmic Mind. Nous, the greater, was for the period of three years(from baptism to crucifixion) using the fleshly garment of the mortal man(Jesus). In order to illustrate this point and still conceal it from theignorant, many strange, and often repulsive, creatures were used whose roughexteriors concealed magnificent organisms. Kenealy, in his notes on the Book ofEnoch, observes: “Why the caterpillar was a symbol of the Messiah is evident;because, under a lowly, creeping, and wholly terrestrial aspect, he conceals thebeautiful butterfly-form, with its radiant wings, emulating in its varied colorsthe Rainbow, the Serpent, the Salmon, the Scarab, the Peacock, and the dyingDolphin * * *.”"},{"pageContent":"INSECTS In 1609 Henry Khunrath’s Amphitheatrum Sapientiœ Æternœ was published. EliphasLevi declared that within its pages are concealed all the great secrets ofmagical philosophy. A remarkable plate in this work shows the Hermetic sciencesbeing attacked by the bigoted and ignorant pedagogues of the seventeenthcentury. In order to express his complete contempt for his slanderers, Khunrathmade out of each a composite beast, adding donkey ears to one and a false tailto another. He reserved the upper part of the picture for certain pettybackbiters to whom he gave appropriate forms. The air was filled with strangecreatures—great dragon flies, winged frogs, birds with human heads, and otherweird forms which defy description—heaping venom, gossip, spite, slander, andother forms of persecution upon the secret arcanum of the wise. The drawingindicated that their attacks were ineffectual. Poisonous insects were often usedto symbolize the deadly power of the human tongue.Insects of all kinds were also considered emblematic of the Nature spirits anddaemons, for both were believed to inhabit the atmosphere. Mediaeval drawingsshowing magicians in the act of invoking spirits often portray the mysteriouspowers of the other world, which the conjurer has exorcised, as appearing to himin composite part-insect forms. The early philosophers apparently held theopinion that the diseases which swept through communities in the form of plagueswere actually living creatures, but instead of considering a number of tinygerms they viewed the entire plague as one individuality and gave it a hideousshape to symbolize its destructiveness. The fact that plagues came in the aircaused an insect or a bird to be used as their symbol.Beautiful symmetrical forms were assigned to all natural benevolent conditionsor powers, but to unnatural or malevolent powers were assigned contorted andabnormal figures. The Evil One was either hideously deformed or else of thenature of certain despised animals. A popular superstition during the MiddleAges held that the Devil had the feet of a rooster, while the Egyptians assignedto Typhon (Devil) the body of a hog.The habits of the insects were carefully studied. Therefore the ant was lookedupon as emblematic of industry and foresight, as it stored up supplies for thewinter and also had strength to move objects many times its own weight. Thelocusts which swept down in clouds, and in some parts of Africa and Asiaobscured the sun and destroyed every green thing, were considered fit emblems ofpassion, disease, hate, and strife; for these emotions destroy all that is goodin the soul of man and leave a barren desert behind them. In the folklore ofvarious nations, certain insects are given special significance, but the oneswhich have received world-wide veneration and consideration are the scarab, theking of the insect kingdom; the scorpion, the great betrayer; the butterfly, theemblem of metamorphosis; and the bee, the symbol of industry.The Egyptian scarab is one of the most remarkable symbolic figures everconceived by the mind of man. It was evolved by the erudition of the priestcraftfrom a simple insect which, because of its peculiar habits and appearance,properly symbolized the strength of the body, the resurrection of the soul, andthe Eternal and Incomprehensible Creator in His aspect as Lord of the Sun. E. A.Wallis Budge says, in effect, of the worship of the scarab by the Egyptians:079 [images/00080.jpg] ROYAL EGYPTIAN SCARAB.The flat under side of a scarab usually bears an inscription relating to thedynasty during which it was cut. These scarabs were sometimes used as seals.Some were cut from ordinary or precious stones; others were made of clay, bakedand glazed. Occasionally the stone scarabs were also glazed. The majority of thesmall scarabs are pierced as though originally used as beads. Some are so hardthat they will cut glass. In the picture above, A shows top and side views ofthe scarab, and B the under surface with the name of Men-ka-Ra within thecentral cartouche. “Yet another view held in primitive times was that the sky was a vast meadowover which a huge beetle crawled, pushing the disk of the sun before him. Thisbeetle was the Sky-god, and, arguing from the example of the beetle (Scarabœussacer), which was observed to roll along with its hind legs a ball that wasbelieved to contain its eggs, the early Egyptians thought that the ball of theSky-god contained his egg and that the sun was his offspring. Thanks, however,to the investigations of the eminent entomologist, Monsieur J. H. Fabre, we nowknow that the ball which the Scarabœus sacer rolls along contains not its eggs,but dung that is to serve as food for its egg, which it lays in a carefullyprepared place.”Initiates of the Egyptian Mysteries were sometimes called scarabs; again, lionsand panthers. The scarab was the emissary of the sun, symbolizing light, truth,and regeneration. Stone scarabs, called heart scarabs, about three inches long,were placed in the heart cavity of the dead when that organ was removed to beembalmed separately as part of the process of mummifying. Some maintain that thestone beetles were merely wrapped in the winding cloths at the time of preparingthe body for eternal preservation. The following passage concerning this appearsin the great Egyptian book of initiation, The Book of the Dead: “And behold,thou shalt make a scarab of green stone, which shall be placed in the breast ofa man, and it shall perform for him, ‘the opening of the mouth: The funeralrites of many nations bear a striking resemblance to the initiatory ceremoniesof their Mysteries.Ra, the god of the sun, had three important aspects. As the Creator of theuniverse he was symbolized by the head of a scarab and was called Khepera, whichsignified the resurrection of the soul and a new life at the end of the mortalspan. The mummy cases of the Egyptian dead were nearly always ornamented withscarabs. Usually one of these beetles, with outspread wings, was painted on themummy case directly over the breast of the dead. The finding of such greatnumbers of small stone scarabs indicates that they were a favorite article ofadornment among the Egyptians. Because of its relationship to the sun, thescarab symbolized the divine part of man’s nature. The fact that its beautifulwings were concealed under its glossy shell typified the winged soul of manhidden within its earthly sheath. The Egyptian soldiers were given the scarab astheir special symbol because the ancients believed that these creatures were allof the male sex and consequently appropriate emblems of virility, strength, andcourage.Plutarch noted the fact that the scarab rolled its peculiar ball of dungbackwards, while the insect itself faced the opposite direction. This made it anespecially fitting symbol for the sun, because this orb (according to Egyptianastronomy) was rolling from west to east, although apparently moving in theopposite direction. An Egyptian allegory states that the sunrise is caused bythe scarab unfolding its wings, which stretch out as glorious colors on eachside of its body—the solar globe—and that when it folds its wings under its darkshell at sunset, night follows. Khepera, the scarab-headed aspect of Ra, isoften symbolized riding through the sea of the sky in a wonderful ship calledthe Boat of the Sun.The scorpion is the symbol of both wisdom and self-destruction. It was called bythe Egyptians the creature accursed; the time of year when the sun entered thesign of Scorpio marked the beginning of the rulership of Typhon. When the twelvesigns of the zodiac were used to represent the twelve Apostles (although thereverse is true), the scorpion was assigned to Judas Iscariot—the betrayer.The scorpion stings with its tail, and for this reason it has been called abackbiter, a false and deceitful thing. Calmet, in his Dictionary of the Bible,declares the scorpion to be a fit emblem of the wicked and the symbol ofpersecution. The dry winds of Egypt are said to be produced by Typhon, whoimparts to the sand the blistering heat of the infernal world and the sting ofthe scorpion. This insect was also the symbol of the spinal fire which,according to the Egyptian Mysteries, destroyed man when it was permitted togather at the base of his spine (the tail of the scorpion). The red star Antaresin the back of the celestial scorpion was considered the worst light in theheavens. Kalb al Akrab, or the heart of the scorpion, was called by the ancientsthe lieutenant or deputy of Mars. (See footnote to Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos.)Antares was believed to impair the eyesight, often causing blindness if it roseover the horizon when a child was born. This may refer again to the sand storm,which was capable of blinding unwary travelers.080 [images/00081.jpg] THE FLEUR-DE-LIS.The bee was used as a symbol of royalty by the immortal Charlemagne, and it isprobable that the fleur-de-lis. or lily of France, is merely a conventionalizedbee and not a flower. There is an ancient Greek legend to the effect that thenine Muses occasionally assumed the form of bees. The scorpion was also the symbol of wisdom, for the fire which it controlled wascapable of illuminating as well as consuming. Initiation into the GreaterMysteries among the pagans was said to take place only in the sign of thescorpion. In the papyrus of Ani (The Book of the Dead), the deceased likens hissoul to a scorpion, saying: “I am a swallow, I am that scorpion, the daughter ofRa!” Elizabeth Goldsmith, in her treatise on Sex Symbolism, states that thescorpions were a “symbol of Selk, the Egyptian goddess of writing, and also[were] revered by the Babylonians and Assyrians as guardians of the gateway ofthe sun. Seven scorpions were said to have accompanied Isis when she searchedfor the remains of Osiris scattered by Set” (Typhon).In his Chaldean Account of the Genesis, George Smith, copying from the cuneiformcylinders, in describing the wanderings of the hero Izdubar (Nimrod), throwssome light on the scorpion god who guards the sun. The tablet which hetranslated is not perfect, but the meaning is fairly clear: “* * * who each dayguard the rising sun. Their crown was at the lattice of heaven, under hell theirfeet were placed [the spinal column]. The scorpion man guarded the gate, burningwith terribleness, their appearance was like death, the might of his fear shookthe forest. At the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun, they guardedthe sun; Izdubar saw them and fear and terror came into his face.” Among theearly Latins there was a machine of war called the scorpion. It was used forfiring arrows and probably obtained its name from a long beam, resembling ascorpion’s tail, which flew up to hurl the arrows. The missiles discharged bythis machine were also called scorpions.The butterfly (under the name of Psyche, a beautiful maiden with wings ofopalescent light) symbolizes the human soul because of the stages it passesthrough in order to unfold its power of flight. The three divisions throughwhich the butterfly passes in its unfoldment resemble closely the three degreesof the Mystery School, which degrees are regarded as consummating the unfoldmentof man by giving him emblematic wings by which he may soar to the skies.Unregenerate man, ignorant and helpless, is symbolized by the stage between ovumand larva; the disciple, seeking truth and dwelling in meditation, by the secondstage, from larva to pupa, at which time the insect enters its chrysalis (thetomb of the Mysteries); the third stage, from pupa to imago (wherein the perfectbutterfly comes forth), typifies the unfolded enlightened soul of the initiaterising from the tomb of his baser nature.Night moths typify the secret wisdom, because they are hard to discover and areconcealed by the darkness (ignorance). Some are emblems of death, as Acherontiaatropos, the death’s-head moth, which has a marking on its body somewhat like ahuman skull. The death-watch beetle, which was believed to give warning ofapproaching death by a peculiar ticking sound, is another instance of insectsinvolved in human affairs.Opinions differ concerning the spider. Its shape makes it an appropriate emblemof the nerve plexus and ganglia of the human body Some Europeans consider itextremely bad luck to kill a spider—possibly because it is looked upon as anemissary of the Evil One, whom no person desires to offend. There is a mysteryconcerning all poisonous creatures, especially insects. Paracelsus taught thatthe spider was the medium for a powerful but evil force which the BlackMagicians used in their nefarious undertakings.Certain plants, minerals, and animals have been sacred among all the nations ofthe earth because of their peculiar sensitiveness to the astral fire—amysterious agency in Nature which the scientific world has contacted through itsmanifestations as electricity and magnetism. Lodestone and radium in the mineralworld and various parasitic growths in the plant kingdom are strangelysusceptible to this cosmic electric fire, or universal life force. The magiciansof the Middle Ages surrounded themselves with such creatures as bats, spiders,cats, snakes, and monkeys, because they were able to appropriate the life forcesof these species and use them to the attainment of their own ends. Some ancientschools of wisdom taught that all poisonous insects and reptiles are germinatedout of the evil nature of man, and that when intelligent human beings no longerbreed hate in their own souls there will be no more ferocious animals, loathsomediseases, or poisonous plants and insects.Among the American Indians is the legend of a “Spider Man,” whose web connectedthe heaven worlds with the earth. The secret schools of India symbolize certainof the gods who labored with the universe during its making as connecting therealms of light with those of darkness by means of webs. Therefore the buildersof the cosmic system who held the embryonic universe together with threads ofinvisible force were sometimes referred to as the Spider Gods and their rulerwas designated The Great Spider.The beehive is found in Masonry as a reminder that in diligence and labor for acommon good true happiness and prosperity are found. The bee is a symbol ofwisdom, for as this tiny insect collects pollen from the flowers, so men mayextract wisdom from the experiences of daily life. The bee is sacred to thegoddess Venus and, according to mystics, it is one of several forms of lifewhich came to the earth from the planet Venus millions of years ago. Wheat andbananas are said to be of similar origin. This is the reason why the origin ofthese three forms of life cannot be traced. The fact that bees are ruled byqueens is one reason why this insect is considered a sacred feminine symbol.In India the god Prana-the personification of the universal life force—issometimes shown surrounded by a circle of bees. Because of its importance inpollenizing flowers, the bee is the accepted symbol of the generative power. Atone time the bee was the emblem of the French kings. The rulers of France worerobes embroidered with bees, and the canopies of their thrones were decoratedwith gigantic figures of these insects.The fly symbolizes the tormentor, because of the annoyance it causes to animals.The Chaldean god Baal was often called Baal-Zebul, or the god of the dwellingplace. The word zebub, or zabab, means a fly, and Baal-Zebul became Baalzebub,or Beezelbub, a word which was loosely translated to mean Jupiter’s fly. The flywas looked upon as a form of the divine power, because of its ability to destroydecaying substances and thus promote health. The fly may have obtained its namezebub from its peculiar buzzing or humming. Inman believes that Baalzebub, whichthe Jews ridiculed as My Lord of Flies, really means My Lord Who Hums orMurmurs.Inman recalls the singing Memnon on the Egyptian desert, a tremendous figurewith an Æolian harp on the top of its head. When the wind blows strongly thisgreat statue sighs, or hums. The Jews changed Baalzebub into Beelzebub, and madehim their prince of devils by interpreting dæmon as “demon.” Naudæus, indefending Virgil from accusations of sorcery, attempted a wholesale denial ofthe miracles supposedly performed by Virgil and produced enough evidence toconvict the poet on all counts. Among other strange feats, Virgil fashioned afly out of brass, and after certain mysterious ceremonies, placed it over one ofthe gates of Naples. As a result, no flies entered the city for more than eightyears."},{"pageContent":"REPTILES The serpent was chosen as the head of the reptilian family. Serpent worship insome form has permeated nearly all parts of the earth. The serpent mounds of theAmerican Indian; the carved-stone snakes of Central and South America; thehooded cobras of India; Python, the great snake of the Greeks; the sacredserpents of the Druids; the Midgard snake of Scandinavia; the Nagas of Burma,Siam, and Cambodia; the brazen serpent of the Jews; the mystic serpent ofOrpheus; the snakes at the oracle of Delphi twining themselves around the tripodupon which the Pythian priestess sat, the tripod itself being in the form oftwisted serpents; the sacred serpents preserved in the Egyptian temples; theUraeus coiled upon the foreheads of the Pharaohs and priests;—all these bearwitness to the universal veneration in which the snake was held. In the ancientMysteries the serpent entwining a staff was the symbol of the physician. Theserpent-wound staff of Hermes remains the emblem of the medical profession.Among nearly all these ancient peoples the serpent was accepted as the symbol ofwisdom or salvation. The antipathy which Christendom feels towards the snake isbased upon the little-understood allegory of the Garden of Eden.The serpent is true to the principle of wisdom, for it tempts man to theknowledge of himself. Therefore the knowledge of self resulted from man’sdisobedience to the Demiurgus, Jehovah. How the serpent came to be in the gardenof the Lord after God had declared that all creatures which He had made duringthe six days of creation were good has not been satisfactorily answered by theinterpreters of Scripture. The tree that grows in the midst of the garden is thespinal fire; the knowledge of the use of that spinal fire is the gift of thegreat serpent. Notwithstanding statements to the contrary, the serpent is thesymbol and prototype of the Universal Savior, who redeems the worlds by givingcreation the knowledge of itself and the realization of good and evil. If thisbe not so, why did Moses raise a brazen serpent upon a cross in the wildernessthat all who looked upon it might be saved from the sting of the lesser snakes?Was not the brazen serpent a prophecy of the crucified Man to come? If theserpent be only a thing of evil, why did Christ instruct His disciples to be aswise as serpents?The accepted theory that the serpent is evil cannot be substantiated. It haslong been viewed as the emblem of immortality It is the symbol of reincarnation,or metempsychosis, because it annually sheds its skin, reappearing, as it were,in a new body. There is an ancient superstition to the effect that snakes neverdie except by violence and that, if uninjured, they would live forever. It wasalso believed that snakes swallowed themselves, and this resulted in their beingconsidered emblematic of the Supreme Creator, who periodically reabsorbed Hisuniverse back into Himself.In Isis Unveiled, H. P. Blavatsky makes this significant statement concerningthe origin of serpent worship: “Before our globe had become egg-shaped or roundit was a long trail of cosmic dust or fire-mist, moving and writhing like aserpent. This, say the explanations, was the Spirit of God moving on the chaosuntil its breath had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume the annularshape of a serpent with its tail in its mouth—emblem of eternity in itsspiritual and of our world in its physical sense.”The seven-headed snake represents the Supreme Deity manifesting through HisElohim, or Seven Spirits, by whose aid He established His universe. The coils ofthe snake have been used by the pagans to symbolize the motion and also theorbits of the celestial bodies, and it is probable that the symbol of theserpent twisted around the egg—which was common to many of the ancient Mysteryschools—represented both the apparent motion of the sun around the earth, andthe bands of astral light, or the great magical agent, which move about theplanet incessantly.Electricity was commonly symbolized by the serpent because of its motion.Electricity passing between the poles of a spark gap is serpentine in itsmotion. Force projected through atmosphere was called The Great Snake. Beingsymbolic of universal force, the serpent was emblematic of both good and evil.Force can tear down as rapidly as it can build up. The serpent with its tail inits mouth is the symbol of eternity, for in this position the body of thereptile has neither beginning nor end. The head and tail represent the positiveand negative poles of the cosmic life circuit. The initiates of the Mysterieswere often referred to as serpents, and their wisdom was considered analogous tothe divinely inspired power of the snake. There is no doubt that the title“Winged Serpents” (the Seraphim?) was given to one of the invisible hierarchiesthat labored with the earth during its early formation.There is a legend that in the beginning of the world winged serpents rained uponthe earth. These were probably the demigods which antedate the historicalcivilization of every nation. The symbolic relationship between the sun and theserpent found literal witness in the fact that life remains in the snake untilsunset, even though it be cut into a dozen parts. The Hopi Indians consider theserpent to be in close communication with the Earth Spirit. Therefore, at thetime of their annual snake dance they send their prayers to the Earth Spirit byfirst specially sanctifying large numbers of these reptiles and then liberatingthem to return to the earth with the prayers of the tribe.The great rapidity of motion manifested by lizards has caused them to beassociated with Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, whose winged feet traveledinfinite distances almost instantaneously. A point which must not be overlookedin connection with reptiles in symbolism is clearly brought out by the eminentscholar, Dr. H. E. Santee, in his Anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord: “Inreptiles there are two pineal bodies, an anterior and a posterior, of which theposterior remains undeveloped but the anterior forms a rudimentary, cyclopeaneye. In the Hatteria, a New Zealand lizard, it projects through the parietalfora- men and presents an imperfect lens and retina and, in its long stalk,nerve fibers.”Crocodiles were regarded by the Egyptians both as symbols of Typhon and emblemsof the Supreme Deity, of the latter because while under water the crocodile iscapable of seeing—Plutarch asserts—though its eyes are covered by a thinmembrane. The Egyptians declared that no matter how far away the crocodile laidits eggs, the Nile would reach up to them in its next inundation, this reptilebeing endowed with a mysterious sense capable of making known the extent of theflood months before it took place. There were two kinds of crocodiles. Thelarger and more ferocious was hated by the Egyptians, for they likened it to thenature of Typhon, their destroying demon. Typhon waited to devour all who failedto pass the Judgment of the Dead, which rite took place in the Hall of Justicebetween the earth and the Elysian Fields. Anthony Todd Thomson thus describesthe good treatment accorded the smaller and tamer crocodiles, which theEgyptians accepted as personifications of good: “They were fed daily andoccasionally had mulled wine poured down their throats. Their ears wereornamented with rings of gold and precious stones, and their forefeet adornedwith bracelets.”To the Chinese the turtle was a symbol of longevity. At a temple in Singapore anumber of sacred turtles are kept, their age recorded by carvings on theirshells. The American Indians use the ridge down the back of the turtle shell asa symbol of the Great Divide between life and death. The turtle is a symbol ofwisdom because it retires into itself and is its own protection. It is also aphallic symbol, as its relation to long life would signify. The Hindussymbolized the universe being supported on the backs of four great elephantswho, in turn, are standing upon an immense turtle which is crawling continuallythrough chaos.The Egyptian sphinx, the Greek centaur, and the Assyrian man-bull have much incommon. All are composite creatures combining human and animal members; in theMysteries all signify the composite nature of man and subtly refer to thehierarchies of celestial beings that have charge of the destiny of mankind.These hierarchies are the twelve holy animals now known as constellations—stargroups which are merely symbols of impersonal spiritual impulses. Chiron, thecentaur, teaching the sons of men, symbolizes the intelligences of theconstellation of Sagittarius, who were the custodians of the secret doctrinewhile (geocentrically) the sun was passing through the sign of Gemini. Thefive-footed Assyrian man-bull with the wings of an eagle and the head of a manis a reminder that the invisible nature of man has the wings of a god, the headof a man, and the body of a beast. The same concept was expressed through thesphinx—that armed guardian of the Mysteries who, crouching at the gate of thetemple, denied entrance to the profane. Thus placed between man and his divinepossibilities, the sphinx also represented the secret doctrine itself.Children’s fairy stories abound with descriptions of symbolic monsters, fornearly all such tales are based upon the ancient mystic folklore."},{"pageContent":"IXX Fishes, Insects, Animals, Reptiles, and Birds PART II As appropriate emblems of various human and divine attributes birds wereincluded in religious and philosophic symbolism—that of pagans and of Christiansalike. Cruelty was signified by the buzzard; courage by the eagle;self-sacrifice by the pelican; and pride by the peacock. The ability of birds toleave the earth and fly aloft toward the source of light has resulted in theirbeing associated with aspiration, purity, and beauty. Wings were therefore oftenadded to various terrene creatures in an effort to suggest transcendency.Because their habitat was among the branches of the sacred trees in the heartsof ancient forests, birds were also regarded as the appointed messengers of thetree spirits and Nature gods dwelling in these consecrated groves, and throughtheir clear notes the gods themselves were said to speak. Many myths have beenfabricated to explain the brilliant plumage of birds. A familiar example is thestory of Juno’s peacock, in whose tail feathers were placed the eyes of Argus.Numerous American Indian legends also deal with birds and the origin of thevarious colors of feathers. The Navahos declare that when all living thingsclimbed to the stalk of a bamboo to escape the Flood, the wild turkey was on thelowest branch and his tail feathers trailed in the water; hence the color wasall washed out.Gravitation, which is a law in the material world, is the impulse toward thecenter of materiality; levitation, which is a law in the spiritual world, is theimpulse toward the center of spirituality. Seeming to be capable of neutralizingthe effect of gravity, the bird was said to partake of a nature superior toother terrestrial creation; and its feathers, because of their sustaining power,came to be accepted as symbols of divinity, courage, and accomplishment. Anotable example is the dignity attached to eagle feathers by the AmericanIndians, among whom they are insignia of merit. Angels have been invested withwings because, like birds, they were considered to be the intermediaries betweenthe gods and men and to inhabit the air or middle kingdom betwixt heaven andearth. As the dome of the heavens was likened to a skull in the GothicMysteries, so the birds which flew across the sky were regarded as thoughts ofthe Deity. For this reason Odin’s two messenger ravens were called Hugin andMunin—thought and memory.081 [images/00082.jpg] THE PHŒNIX ON ITS NEST OF FLAMES.The phœnix is the most celebrated of all the symbolic creatures fabricated bythe ancient Mysteries for the purpose of concealing the great truths of esotericphilosophy. Though modern scholars of natural history declare the existence ofthe phoenix to be purely mythical, Pliny describes the capture of one of thesebirds and its exhibition in the Roman Forum during the reign of the EmperorClaudius. Among the Greeks and Romans, the eagle was the appointed bird of Jupiter andconsequently signified the swiftly moving forces of the Demiurgus; hence it waslooked upon as the mundane lord of the birds, in contradistinction to thephoenix, which was symbolic of the celestial ruler. The eagle typified the sunin its material phase and also the immutable Demiurgic law beneath which allmortal creatures must bend. The eagle was also the Hermetic symbol of sulphur,and signified the mysterious fire of Scorpio—the most profoundly significantsign of the zodiac and the Gate of the Great Mystery. Being one of the threesymbols of Scorpio, the eagle, like the Goat of Mendes, was an emblem of thetheurgic art and the secret processes by which the infernal fire of the scorpionwas transmuted into the spiritual light-fire of the gods.Among certain American Indian tribes the thunderbird is held in peculiar esteem.This divine creature is said to live above the clouds; the flapping of its wingscauses the rumbling which accompanies storms, while the flashes from its eyesare the lightning. Birds were used to signify the vital breath; and among theEgyptians, mysterious hawklike birds with human heads, and carrying in theirclaws the symbol of immortality, are often shown hovering as emblems of theliberated soul over the mummified bodies of the dead. In Egypt the hawk was thesacred symbol of the sun; and Ra, Osiris, and Horus are often depicted with theheads of hawks. The cock, or rooster, was a symbol of Cashmala (Cadmillus) inthe Samothracian Mysteries, and is also a phallic symbol sacred to the sun. Itwas accepted by the Greeks as the emblem of Ares (Mars) and typifiedwatchfulness and defense. When placed in the center of a weather vane itsignifies the sun in the midst of the four corners of creation. The Greekssacrificed a rooster to the gods at the time of entering the EleusinianMysteries. Sir Francis Bacon is supposed to have died as the result of stuffinga fowl with snow. May this not signify Bacon’s initiation into the paganMysteries which still existed in his day?Both the peacock and the ibis were objects of veneration because they destroyedthe poisonous reptiles which were popularly regarded as the emissaries of theinfernal gods. Because of the myriad of eyes in its tail feathers the peacockwas accepted as the symbol of wisdom, and on account of its general appearanceit was often confused with the fabled phœnix of the Mysteries. There is acurious belief that the flesh of the peacock will not putrefy even though keptfor a considerable time. As an outgrowth of this belief the peacock became theemblem of immortality, because the spiritual nature of man—like the flesh ofthis bird—is incorruptible.The Egyptians paid divine honors to the ibis and it was a cardinal crime to killone, even by accident. It was asserted that the ibis could live only in Egyptand that if transported to a foreign country it would die of grief. TheEgyptians declared this bird to be the preserver of crops and especially worthyof veneration because it drove out the winged serpents of Libya which the windblew into Egypt. The ibis was sacred to Thoth, and when its head and neck weretucked under its wing its body closely resembled a human heart. (SeeMontfaucon’s Antiquities.) The black and white ibis was sacred to the moon; butall forms were revered because they destroyed crocodile eggs, the crocodilebeing a symbol of the detested Typhon.Nocturnal birds were appropriate symbols of both sorcery and the secret divinesciences: sorcery because black magic cannot function in the light of truth(day) and is powerful only when surrounded by ignorance (night); and the divinesciences because those possessing the arcana are able to see through thedarkness of ignorance and materiality. Owls and bats were consequently oftenassociated with either witchcraft or wisdom. The goose was an emblem of thefirst primitive substance or condition from which and within which the worldswere fashioned. In the Mysteries, the universe was likened to an egg which theCosmic Goose had laid in space. Because of its blackness the crow was the symbolof chaos or the chaotic darkness preceding the light of creation. The grace andpurity of the swan were emblematic of the spiritual grace and purity of theinitiate. This bird also represented the Mysteries which unfolded thesequalities in humanity. This explains the allegories of the gods (the secretwisdom) incarnating in the body of a swan (the initiate).082 [images/00083.jpg] PHŒNIX OR EAGLE, WHICH?On the left is the bird’s head from the first Great Seal of the United States(1782) and on the right the Great Seal of 1902. When the first Great Seal wasactually cut, the bird represented upon it was very different from the eaglewhich now appears: the neck was much longer and the tuft of feathers at theupper back part of the head was quite noticeable; the beak bore littleresemblance to that of the eagle: and the entire bird was much thinner and itswings shorter. It requires very little imagination to trace in this firstso-called eagle the mythological phœnix of antiquity. What is more, there isevery reason why a phœnix bird should be used to represent a new country risingout of an old, while as Benjamin Franklin caustically noted, the eagle was noteven a bird of good moral character! Being scavengers, the vulture, the buzzard, and the condor signified that formof divine power which by disposing of refuse and other matter dangerous to thelife and health of humanity cleanses and purifies the lower spheres. These birdswere therefore adopted as symbols of the disintegrative processes whichaccomplish good while apparently destroying, and by some religions have beenmistakenly regarded as evil. Birds such as the parrot and raven were accordedveneration because, being able to mimic the human voice, they were looked uponas links between the human and animal kingdoms.The dove, accepted by Christianity as the emblem of the Holy Ghost, is anextremely ancient and highly revered pagan yonic emblem. In many of the ancientMysteries it represented the third person of the Creative Triad, or theFabricator of the world. As the lower worlds were brought into existence througha generative process, so the dove has been associated with those deitiesidentified with the procreative functions. It is sacred to Astarte, Cybele,Isis, Venus, Juno, Mylitta, and Aphrodite. On account of its gentleness anddevotion to its young, the dove was looked upon as the embodiment of thematernal instinct. The dove is also an emblem of wisdom, for it represents thepower and order by which the lower worlds are maintained. It has long beenaccepted as a messenger of the divine will, and signifies the activity of God.The name dove has been given to oracles and to prophets. “The true name of thedove was Ionah or Iönas; it was a very sacred emblem, and at one time almostuniversally received; it was adopted by the Hebrews; and the mystic Dove wasregarded as a symbol from the days of Noah by all those who were of the Churchof God. The prophet sent to Ninevah as God’s messenger was called Jonah or theDove; our Lord’s forerunner, the Baptist, was called in Greek by the name ofIoannes; and so was the Apostle of Love, the author of the fourth Gospel and ofthe Apocalypse, named Ioannes.” (Bryant’s Analysis of Ancient Mythology.)In Masonry the dove is the symbol of purity and innocence. It is significantthat in the pagan Mysteries the dove of Venus was crucified upon the four spokesof a great wheel, thus foreshadowing the mystery of the crucified Lord of Love.Although Mohammed drove the doves from the temple at Mecca, occasionally he isdepicted with a dove sitting upon his shoulder as the symbol of divineinspiration. In ancient times the effigies of doves were placed upon the headsof scepters to signify that those bearing them were overshadowed by divineprerogative. In mediæval art, the dove frequently was pictured as an emblem ofdivine benediction."},{"pageContent":"THE PHŒNIX Clement, one of the ante-Nicæan Fathers, describes, in the first century afterChrist, the peculiar nature and habits of the phoenix, in this wise: “There is acertain bird which is called a Phœnix. This is the only one of its kind andlives five hundred years. And when the time of its dissolution draws near thatit must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and otherspices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as theflesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by thejuices of the dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquiredstrength, it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, andbearing these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city calledHeliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places them onthe altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its former abode.The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and find that it hasreturned exactly as the five hundredth year was completed.”Although admitting that he had not seen the phoenix bird (there being only onealive at a time), Herodotus amplifies a bit the description given by Clement:“They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to becredible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, allplastered with myrrh, to the temple of the sun, and there buries the body. Inorder to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he findsthat he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside;after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then ofexactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over asI have said, and deposits it in the temple of the sun. Such is the story theytell of the doings of this bird.”Both Herodotus and Pliny noted the general resemblance in shape between thephœnix and the eagle, a point which the reader should carefully consider, for itis reasonably certain that the modern Masonic eagle was originally a phoenix.The body of the phœnix is described as having been covered with glossy purplefeathers, while its long tail feathers were alternately blue and red. Its headwas light in color and about its neck was a circlet of golden plumage. At theback of its head the phoenix had a peculiar tuft of feathers, a fact quiteevident, although it has been overlooked by most writers and symbolists.The phœnix was regarded as sacred to the sun, and the length of its life (500 to1000 years) was taken as a standard for measuring the motion of the heavenlybodies and also the cycles of time used in the Mysteries to designate theperiods of existence. The diet of the bird was unknown. Some writers declarethat it subsisted upon the atmosphere; others that it ate at rare intervals butnever in the presence of man. Modern Masons should realize the special Masonicsignificance of the phoenix, for the bird is described as using sprigs of acaciain the manufacture of its nest.083 [images/00084.jpg] AN EGYPTIAN PHŒNIX.The Egyptians occasionally represented the phœnix as having the body of a manand the wings of a bird. This biform creature had a tuft of feathers upon itshead and its arms were upraised in an attitude of prayer. As the phœnix was thesymbol of regeneration, the tuft of feathers on the back of its head might wellsymbolize the activity of the pineal gland, or third eye, the occult function ofwhich was apparently well understood by the ancient priesthood. The phœnix (which is the mythological Persian roc) is also the name of aSouthern constellation, and therefore it has both an astronomical and anastrological significance. In all probability, the phœnix was the swan of theGreeks, the eagle of the Romans, and the peacock of the Far East. To the ancientmystics the phœnix was a most appropriate symbol of the immortality of the humansoul, for just as the phœnix was reborn out of its own dead self seven timesseven, so again and again the spiritual nature of man rises triumphant from hisdead physical body.Mediaeval Hermetists regarded the phœnix as a symbol of the accomplishment ofalchemical transmutation, a process equivalent to human regeneration. The namePhœnix was also given to one of the secret alchemical formulae. The familiarpelican of the Rose Croix degree, feeding its young from its own breast, is inreality a phoenix, a fact which can be confirmed by an examination of the headof the bird. The ungainly lower part of the pelican’s beak is entirely missing,the head of the phoenix being far more like that of an eagle than of a pelican.In the Mysteries it was customary to refer to initiates as phœnixes or men whohad been born again, for just as physical birth gives man consciousness in thephysical world, so the neophyte, after nine degrees in the womb of theMysteries, was born into a consciousness of the spiritual world. This is themystery of the initiation to which Christ referred when he said, “Except a manbe born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John iii. 3). The phœnix is afitting symbol of this spiritual birth.084 [images/00085.jpg] THE OBVERSE AND REVERSE OF THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The significance of the mystical number 13, which frequently appears upon theGreat Seal of the United States, is not limited to the number of the originalcolonies. The sacred emblem of the ancient initiates, here composed of 13 stars,also appears above the head of the “eagle.” The motto, E Pluribus Unum, contains13 letters, as does also the inscription, Annuit Cœptis. The “eagle” clutches inits right talon a branch bearing 13 leaves and 13 berries and in its left asheaf of 13 arrows. The face of the pyramid, exclusive of the panel containingthe date, consists of 72 stones arranged in 13 rows. European mysticism was not dead at the time the United States of America wasfounded. The hand of the Mysteries controlled in the establishment of the newgovernment, for the signature of the Mysteries may still be seen on the GreatSeal of the United States of America. Careful analysis of the seal discloses amass of occult and Masonic symbols, chief among them the so-called Americaneagle—a bird which Benjamin Franklin declared unworthy to be chosen as theemblem of a great, powerful, and progressive people. Here again only the studentof symbolism can see through the subterfuge and realize that the American eagleupon the Great Seal is but a conventionalized phœnix, a fact plainly discerniblefrom an examination of the original seal. In his sketch of The History of theSeal of the United States, Gaillard Hunt unwittingly brings forward muchmaterial to substantiate the belief that the original seal carried the phœnixbird on its obverse surface and the Great Pyramid of Gizeh upon its reversesurface. In a colored sketch submitted as a design for the Great Seal by WilliamBarton in 1782, an actual phœnix appears sitting upon a nest of flames. Thisitself demonstrates a tendency towards the use of this emblematic bird.If any one doubts the presence of Masonic and occult influences at the time theGreat Seal was designed, he should give due consideration to the comments ofProfessor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, who wrote concerning the unfinishedpyramid and the All-Seeing Eye which adorned the reverse of the seal, asfollows: “The device adopted by Congress is practically incapable of effectivetreatment; it can hardly (however artistically treated by the designer) lookotherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic fraternity.” (The History of theSeal of the United States.)The eagles of Napoleon and Caesar and the zodiacal eagle of Scorpio are reallyphœnixes, for the latter bird—not the eagle—is the symbol of spiritual victoryand achievement. Masonry will be in a position to solve many of the secrets ofits esoteric doctrine when it realizes that both its single- and double-headedeagles are phoenixes, and that to all initiates and philosophers the phœnix isthe symbol of the transmutation and regeneration of the creative energy—commonlycalled the accomplishment of the Great Work. The double-headed phoenix is theprototype of an androgynous man, for according to the secret teachings therewill come a time when the human body will have two spinal cords, by means ofwhich vibratory equilibrium will be maintained in the body.Not only were many of the founders of the United States Government Masons, butthey received aid from a secret and august body existing in Europe, which helpedthem to establish this country for a peculiar and particular purpose known onlyto the initiated few. The Great Seal is the signature of this exaltedbody—unseen and for the most part unknown—and the unfinished pyramid upon itsreverse side is a trestlebroard setting forth symbolically the task to theaccomplishment of which the United States Government was dedicated from the dayof its inception."},{"pageContent":"ANIMALS The lion is the king of the animal family and, like the head of each kingdom, issacred to the sun, whose rays are symbolized by the lion’s shaggy mane. Theallegories perpetuated by the Mysteries (such as the one to the effect that thelion opens the secret book) signify that the solar power opens the seed pods,releasing the spiritual life within. There was also a curious belief among theancients that the lion sleeps with his eyes open, and for this reason the animalwas chosen as a symbol of vigilance. The figure of a lion placed on either sideof doors and gateways is an emblem of divine guardianship. King Solomon wasoften symbolized as a lion. For ages the feline family has been regarded withpeculiar veneration. In several of the Mysteries—most notably the Egyptian—thepriests wore the skins of lions, tigers, panthers, pumas, or leopards. Herculesand Samson (both Solar symbols) slew the lion of the constellation of Leo androbed themselves in his skin, thus signifying that they represented the sunitself when at the summit of the celestial arch.t Bubastis in Egypt was the temple of the famous goddess Bast, the cat deity ofthe Ptolemies. The Egyptians paid homage to the cat, especially when its fur wasof three shades or its eyes of different colors. To the priests the cat wassymbolic of the magnetic forces of Nature, and they surrounded themselves withthese animals for the sake of the astral fire which emanated from their bodies.The cat was also a symbol of eternity, for when it sleeps it curls up into aball with its head and tail touching. Among the Greeks and Latins the cat wassacred to the goddess Diana. The Buddhists of India invested the cat withspecial significance, but for a different reason. The cat was the only animalabsent at the death of the great Buddha, because it had stopped on the way tochase a mouse. That the symbol of the lower astral forces should not be presentat the liberation of the Buddha is significant.Regarding the cat, Herodotus says: “Whenever a fire breaks out, cats areagitated with a kind of divine motion, which they that keep them observe,neglecting the fire: The cats, however, in spite of their care, break from them,leaping even over the heads of their keepers to throw themselves into the fire.The Egyptians then make great mourning for their death. If a cat dies a naturaldeath in a house, all they of that house shave their eyebrows: If a dog, theyshave the head and all the body. They used to embalm their dead cats, and carrythem to Bubastis to be interred in a sacred house.” (Montfaucon’s Antiquities.)The most important of all symbolic animals was the Apis, or Egyptian bull ofMemphis, which was regarded as the sacred vehicle for the transmigration of thesoul of the god Osiris. It was declared that the Apis was conceived by a bolt oflightning, and the ceremony attendant upon its selection and consecration wasone of the most impressive in Egyptian ritualism. The Apis had to be marked in acertain manner. Herodotus states that the bull must be black with a square whitespot on his forehead, the form of an eagle (probably a vulture) on his back, abeetle upon (under) his tongue, and the hair of his tail lying two ways. Otherwriters declare that the sacred bull was marked with twenty-nine sacred symbols,his body was spotted, and upon his right side was a white mark in the form of acrescent. After its sanctification the Apis was kept in a stable adjacent to thetemple and led in processionals through the streets of the city upon certainsolemn occasions. It was a popular belief among the Egyptians that any childupon whom the bull breathed would become illustrious. After reaching a certainage (twenty-five years) the Apis was taken either to the river Nile or to asacred fountain (authorities differ on this point) and drowned, amidst thelamentations of the populace. The mourning and wailing for his death continueduntil the new Apis was found, when it was declared that Osiris had reincarnated,whereupon rejoicing took the place of grief.The worship of the bull was not confined to Egypt, but was prevalent in manynations of the ancient world. In India, Nandi—the sacred white bull of Siva—isstill the object of much veneration; and both the Persians and the Jews acceptedthe bull as an important religious symbol. The Assyrians, Phœnicians, Chaldeans,and even the Greeks reverenced this animal, and Jupiter turned himself into awhite bull to abduct Europa. The bull was a powerful phallic emblem signifyingthe paternal creative power of the Demiurgus. At his death he was frequentlymummified and buried with the pomp and dignity of a god in a specially preparedsarcophagus. Excavations in the Serapeum at Memphis have uncovered the tombs ofmore than sixty of these sacred animals.As the sign rising over the horizon at the vernal equinox constitutes the starrybody for the annual incarnation of the sun, the bull not only was the celestialsymbol of the Solar Man but, because the vernal equinox took place in theconstellation of Taurus, was called the breaker or opener of the year. For thisreason in astronomical symbolism the bull is often shown breaking the annularegg with his horns. The Apis further signifies that the God-Mind is incarnatedin the body of a beast and therefore that the physical beast form is the sacredvehicle of divinity. Man’s lower personality is the Apis in which Osirisincarnates. The result of the combination is the creation of Sor-Apis(Serapis)—the material soul as ruler of the irrational material body andinvolved therein. After a certain period (which is determined by the square offive, or twenty-five years), the body of the Apis is destroyed and the soulliberated by the water which drowns the material life. This was indicative ofthe washing away of the material nature by the baptismal waters of divine lightand truth. The drowning of the Apis is the symbol of death; the resurrection ofOsiris in the new bull is the symbol of eternal renovation. The white bull wasalso symbolically sacred as the appointed emblem of the initiates, signifyingthe spiritualized material bodies of both man and Nature.When the vernal equinox no longer occurred in the sign of Taurus, the Sun Godincarnated in the constellation of Aries and the ram then became the vehicle ofthe solar power. Thus the sun rising in the sign of the Celestial Lamb triumphsover the symbolic serpent of darkness. The lamb is a familiar emblem of puritybecause of its gentleness and the whiteness of its wool. In many of the paganMysteries it signified the Universal Savior, and in Christianity it is thefavorite symbol of Christ. Early church paintings show a lamb standing upon alittle hill, and from its feet pour four streams of living water signifying thefour Gospels. The blood of the lamb is the solar life pouring into the worldthrough the sign of Aries.The goat is both a phallic symbol and also an emblem of courage or aspirationbecause of its surefootedness and ability to scale the loftiest peaks. To thealchemists the goat’s head was the symbol of sulphur. The practice among theancient Jews of choosing a scapegoat upon which to heap the sins of mankind ismerely an allegorical depiction of the Sun Man who is the scapegoat of the worldand upon whom are cast the sins of the twelve houses (tribes) of the celestialuniverse. Truth is the Divine Lamb worshiped throughout pagandom and slain forthe sins of the world, and since the dawn of time the Savior Gods of allreligions have been personifications of this Truth. The Golden Fleece sought byJason and his Argonauts is the Celestial Lamb—the spiritual and intellectualsun. The secret doctrine is also typified by the Golden Fleece—the wool of theDivine Life, the rays of the Sun of Truth. Suidas declares the Golden Fleece tohave been in reality a book, written upon skin, which contained the formulæ forthe production of gold by means of chemistry. The Mysteries were institutionselected for the transmutation of base ignorance into precious illumination. Thedragon of ignorance was the terrible creature set to guard the Golden Fleece,and represents the darkness of the old year which battles with the sun at thetime of its equinoctial passage.Deer were sacred in the Bacchic Mysteries of the Greeks; the Bacchantes wereoften clothed in fawnskins. Deer were associated with the worship of the moongoddess and the Bacchic orgies were usually conducted at night. The grace andspeed of this animal caused it to be accepted as the proper symbol of estheticabandon. Deer were objects of veneration with many nations. In Japan, herds ofthem are still maintained in connection with the temples.The wolf is usually associated with the principle of evil, because of themournful discordance of its howl and the viciousness of its nature. InScandinavian mythology the Fenris Wolf was one of the sons of Loki, the infernalgod of the fires. With the temple of Asgard in flames about them, the gods underthe command of Odin fought their last great battle against the chaotic forces ofevil. With frothing jowls the Fenis Wolf devoured Odin, the Father of the Gods,and thus destroyed the Odinic universe. Here the Fenris Wolf represents thosemindless powers of Nature that overthrew the primitive creation.The unicorn, or monoceros, was a most curious creation of the ancient initiates.It is described by Thomas Boreman as “a beast, which though doubted of by manywriters, yet is by others thus described: He has but one horn, and that anexceedingly rich one, growing out of the middle of his forehead. His headresembles an hart‘s, his feet an elephant’s, his tail a boar’s, and the rest ofhis body an horse’s. The horn is about a foot and half in length. His voice islike the lowing of an ox. His mane and hair are of a yellowish colour. His hornis as hard as iron, and as rough as any file, twisted or curled, like a flamingsword; very straight, sharp, and every where black, excepting the point. Greatvirtues are attributed to it, in expelling of poison and curing of severaldiseases. He is not a beast of prey.” (See Redgrove’s Bygone Beliefs.)While the unicorn is mentioned several times in Scripture, no proof has yet beendiscovered of its existence. There are a number of drinking horns in variousmuseums presumably fashioned from its spike. It is reasonably certain, however,that these drinking vessels were really made either from the tusks of some largemammal or the horn of a rhinoceros. J. P. Lundy believes that the horn of theunicorn symbolizes the horn of salvation mentioned by St. Luke which, prickingthe hearts of men, turns them to a consideration of salvation through Christ.Mediaeval Christian mystics employed the unicorn as an emblem of Christ, andthis creature must therefore signify the spiritual life in man. The single hornof the unicorn may represent the pineal gland, or third eye, which is thespiritual cognition center in the brain. The unicorn was adopted by theMysteries as a symbol of the illumined spiritual nature of the initiate, thehorn with which it defends itself being the flaming sword of the spiritualdoctrine against which nothing can prevail.In the Book of Lambspring, a rare Hermetic tract, appears an engraving showing adeer and a unicorn standing together in a wood. The picture is accompanied bythe following text: “The Sages say truly that two animals are in this forest:One glorious, beautiful, and swift, a great and strong deer; the other anunicorn. * * * If we apply the parable of our art, we shall call the forest thebody. * * * The unicorn will be the spirit at all times. The deer desires noother name but that of the soul; * * *. He that knows how to tame and masterthem by art, to couple them together, and to lead them in and out of the forest,may justly be called a Master.”The Egyptian devil, Typhon, was often symbolized by the Set monster whoseidentity is obscure. It has a queer snoutlike nose and pointed ears, and mayhave been a conventional hyena. The Set monster lived in the sand storms andwandered about the world promulgating evil. The Egyptians related the howling ofthe desert winds with the moaning cry of the hyena. Thus when in the depths ofthe night the hyena sent forth its doleful wail it sounded like the lastdespairing cry of a lost soul in the clutches of Typhon. Among the duties ofthis evil creature was that of protecting the Egyptian dead against graverobbers.Among other symbols of Typhon was the hippopotamus, sacred to the god Marsbecause Mars was enthroned in the sign of Scorpio, the house of Typhon. The asswas also sacred to this Egyptian demon. Jesus riding into Jerusalem upon theback of an ass has the same significance as Hermes standing upon the prostrateform of Typhon. The early Christians were accused of worshiping the head of anass. A most curious animal symbol is the hog or sow, sacred to Diana, andfrequently employed in the Mysteries as an emblem of the occult art. The wildboar which goared Atys shows the use of this animal in the Mysteries.According to the Mysteries, the monkey represents the condition of man beforethe rational soul entered into his constitution. Therefore it typifies theirrational man. By some the monkey is looked upon as a species not ensouled bythe spiritual hierarchies; by others as a fallen state wherein man has beendeprived of his divine nature through degeneracy. The ancients, thoughevolutionists, did not trace man’s ascent through the monkey; the monkey theyconsidered as having separated itself from the main stem of progress. The monkeywas occasionally employed as a symbol of learning. Cynocephalus, the dog-headedape, was the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol of writing, and was closely associatedwith Thoth. Cynocephalus is symbolic of the moon and Thoth of the planetMercury. Because of the ancient belief that the moon followed Mercury about theheavens the dog-ape was described as the faithful companion of Thoth.The dog, because of its faithfulness, denotes the relationship which shouldexist between disciple and master or between the initiate and his God. Theshepherd dog was a type of the priestcraft. The dog’s ability to sense andfollow unseen persons for miles symbolized the transcendental power by which thephilosopher follows the thread of truth through the labyrinth of earthly error.The dog is also the symbol of Mercury. The Dog Star, Sirius or Sothis, wassacred to the Egyptians because it presaged the annual inundations of the Nile.As a beast of burden the horse was the symbol of the body of man forced tosustain the weight of his spiritual constitution. Conversely, it also typifiedthe spiritual nature of man forced to maintain the burden of the materialpersonality. Chiron, the centaur, mentor of Achilles, represents the primitivecreation which was the progenitor and instructor of mankind, as described byBerossus. The winged horse and the magic carpet both symbolize the secretdoctrine and the spiritualized body of man. The wooden horse of Troy, secretingan army for the capture of the city, represents man’s body concealing within itthose infinite potentialities which will later come forth and conquer hisenvironment. Again, like Noah’s Ark, it represents the spiritual nature of manas containing a host of latent potentialities which subsequently become active.The siege of Troy is a symbolic account of the abduction of the human soul(Helena) by the personality (Paris) and its final redemption, throughpersevering struggle, by the secret doctrine—the Greek army under the command ofAgamemnon."},{"pageContent":"XX Flowers, plants, Fruits, and Trees The yoni and phallus were worshiped by nearly all ancient peoples as appropriatesymbols of God’s creative power. The Garden of Eden, the Ark, the Gate of theTemple, the Veil of the Mysteries, the vesica piscis or oval nimbus, and theHoly Grail are important yonic symbols; the pyramid, the obelisk, the cone, thecandle, the tower, the Celtic monolith, the spire, the campanile, the Maypole,and the Sacred Spear are symbolic of the phallus. In treating the subject ofPriapic worship, too many modern authors judge pagan standards by their own andwallow in the mire of self-created vulgarity. The Eleusinian Mysteries—thegreatest of all the ancient secret societies—established one of the highestknown standards of morality and ethics, and those criticizing their use ofphallic symbols should ponder the trenchant words of King Edward III, “Honi soitqui maly pense.”The obscene rites practiced by the later Bacchanalia and Dionysia were no morerepresentative of the standards of purity originally upheld by the Mysteriesthan the orgies occasionally occurring among the adherents of Christianity tillthe eighteenth century were representative of primitive Christianity. SirWilliam Hamilton, British Minister at the Court of Naples, declares that in1780, Isernia, a community of Christians in Italy, worshiped with phallicceremonies the pagan god Priapus under the name of St. Cosmo. (See Two Essays onthe Worship of Priapus, by Richard Payne Knight.)Father, mother, and child constitute the natural trinity. The Mysteriesglorified the home as the supreme institution consisting of this trinityfunctioning as a unit. Pythagoras likened the universe to the family, declaringthat as the supreme fire of the universe was in the midst of its heavenlybodies, so, by analogy, the supreme fire of the world was upon its hearthstones.The Pythagorean and other schools of philosophy conceived the one divine natureof God to manifest itself in the threefold aspect of Father, Mother, and Child.These three constituted the Divine Family, whose dwelling place is creation andwhose natural and peculiar symbol is the 47th problem of Euclid. God the Fatheris spirit, God the Mother is matter, and God the Child—the product of thetwo—represents the sum of living things born out of and constituting Nature. Theseed of spirit is sown in the womb of matter, and by an immaculate (pure)conception the progeny is brought into being. Is not this the true mystery ofthe Madonna holding the Holy Babe in her arms? Who dares to say that suchsymbolism is improper? The mystery of life is the supreme mystery, revealed inall of its divine dignity and glorified as Nature’s perfect achievement by theinitiated sages and seers of all ages.085 [images/00086.jpg] THE TREE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.This remarkable example of the use of the tree in symbolism is from the Chateaude Pierrefonds in the little town of Pierrefonds in northern France. The eightside branches end in conventional cuplike flowers, from each of which rises thebody of a knight carrying in his hand a ribbon bearing his name. The centralstem is surmounted by a larger flower, from which emerges the body of KingArthur himself. The tree is a favorite motif in heraldry. The one trunk with itsmultitude of branches caused the tree to be frequently used in diagrammingfamily lineage, from which practice has arisen the custom of terming such tables“family trees.” The prudery of today, however, declares this same mystery to be unfit for theconsideration of holy-minded people. Contrary to the dictates of reason, astandard has been established which affirms that innocence bred of ignorance ismore to be desired than virtue born of knowledge. Eventually, however, man willlearn that he need never be ashamed of truth. Until he does learn this, he isfalse to his God, to his world, and to himself. In this respect, Christianityhas woefully failed in its mission. While declaring man’s body to be the livingtemple of the living God, in the same breath it asserts the substances andfunctions of this temple to be unclean and their study defiling to the sensitivesentiments of the righteous. By this unwholesome attitude, man’s body—the houseof God—is degraded and defamed. Yet the cross itself is the oldest of phallicemblems, and the lozenge-shaped windows of cathedrals are proof that yonicsymbols have survived the destruction of the pagan Mysteries. The very structureof the church itself is permeated with phallicism. Remove from the ChristianChurch all emblems of Priapic origin and nothing is left, for even the earthupon which it stands was, because of its fertility, the first yonic symbol. Asthe presence of these emblems of the generative processes is either unknown orunheeded by the majority, the irony of the situation is not generallyappreciated. Only those conversant with the secret language of antiquity arecapable of understanding the divine significance of these emblems.Flowers were chosen as symbols for many reasons. The great variety of flora madeit possible to find some plant or flower which would be a suitable figure fornearly any abstract quality or condition. A plant might be chosen because ofsome myth connected with its origin, as the stories of Daphne and Narcissus;because of the peculiar environment in which it thrived, as the orchid and thefungus; because of its significant shape, as the passion flower and the Easterlily; because of its brilliance or fragrance, as the verbena and the sweetlavender; because it preserved its form indefinitely, as the everlasting flower;because of unusual characteristics, as the sunflower and heliotrope, which havelong been sacred because of their affinity for the sun.The plant might also be considered worthy of veneration because from its crushedleaves, petals, stalks, or roots could be extracted healing unctions, essences,or drugs affecting the nature and intelligence of human beings—such as the poppyand the ancient herbs of prophecy. The plant might also be regarded asefficacious in the cure of many diseases because its fruit, leaves, petals, orroots bore a resemblance in shape or color to parts or organs of the human body.For example, the distilled juices of certain species of ferns, also the hairymoss growing upon oaks, and the thistledown were said to have the power ofgrowing hair; the dentaria, which resembles a tooth in shape, was said to curethe toothache; and the palma Christi plant, because of its shape, cured allafflictions of the hands.The blossom is really the reproductive system of the plant and is thereforesingularly appropriate as a symbol of sexual purity—an absolute requisite of theancient Mysteries. Thus the flower signifies this ideal of beauty andregeneration which must ultimately take the place of lust and degeneracy.Of all symbolic flowers the lotus blossom of India and Egypt and the rose of theRosicrucians are the most important. In their symbolism these two flowers areconsidered identical. The esoteric doctrines for which the Eastern lotus standshave been perpetuated in modern Europe under the form of the rose. The rose andthe lotus are yonic emblems, signifying primarily the maternal creative mystery,while the Easter lily is considered to be phallic.The Brahmin and Egyptian initiates, who undoubtedly understood the secretsystems of spiritual culture whereby the latent centers of cosmic energy in manmay be stimulated, employed the lotus blossoms to represent the spinningvortices of spiritual energy located at various points along the spinal columnand called chakras, or whirling wheels, by the Hindus. Seven of these chakrasare of prime importance and have their individual correspondences in the nerveganglia and plexuses. According to the secret schools, the sacral ganglion iscalled the four-petaled lotus; the prostatic plexus, the six-petaled lotus; theepi gastric plexus and navel, the ten-petaled lotus; the cardiac plexus, thetwelve-petaled lotus; the pharyngeal plexus, the sixteen-petaled lotus; thecavernous plexus, the two-petaled lotus; and the pineal gland or adjacentunknown center, the thousand-petaled lotus. The color, size, and number ofpetals upon the lotus are the keys to its symbolic import. A hint concerning theunfoldment of spiritual understanding according to the secret science of theMysteries is found in the story of Aaron’s rod that budded, and also in Wagner’sgreat opera, Tannhäuser, where the budding staff of the Pope signifies theunfolding blossoms upon the sacred rod of the Mysteries—the spinal column.The Rosicrucians used a garland of roses to signify the same spiritual vortices,which are referred to in the Bible as the seven lamps of the candlestick and theseven churches of Asia. In the 1642 edition of Sir Francis Bacon’s History ofHenry the Seventh is a frontispiece showing Lord Bacon with Rosicrucian rosesfor shoe buckles.In the Hindu system of philosophy, each petal of the form bears a certain symbolwhich gives an added clue to the meaning of the flower. The Orientals also usedthe lotus plant to signify the growth of man through the three periods of humanconsciousness—ignorance, endeavor, and understanding. As the lotus exists inthree elements (earth, water, and air) so man lives in three worlds—material,intellectual, and spiritual. As the plant, with its roots in the mud and theslime, grows upward through the water and finally blossoms forth in the lightand air, so the spiritual growth of man is upward from the darkness of baseaction and desire into the light of truth and understanding, the water servingas a symbol of the ever-changing world of illusion through which the soul mustpass in its struggle to reach the state of spiritual illumination. The rose andits Eastern equivalent, the lotus, like all beautiful flowers, representspiritual unfoldment and attainment: hence, the Eastern deities are often shownseated upon the open petals of the lotus blossoms.The lotus was also a universal motif in Egyptian art and architecture. The roofsof many temples were upheld by lotus columns, signifying the eternal wisdom; andthe lotus-headed scepter—symbolic of self-unfoldment and divine prerogative—wasoften carried in religious processions. When the flower had nine petals, it wassymbolic of man; when twelve, of the universe and the gods; when seven, of theplanets and the law; when five, of the senses and the Mysteries; and when three,of the chief deities and the worlds. The heraldic rose of the Middle Agesgenerally has either five or ten petals, thereby showing its relationship to thespiritual mystery of man through the Pythagorean pentad and decad."},{"pageContent":"CULTUS ARBORUM The worship of trees as proxies of Divinity was prevalent throughout the ancientworld. Temples were often built in the heart of sacred groves, and nocturnalceremonials were conducted under the wide-spreading branches of great trees,fantastically decorated and festooned in honor of their patron deities. In manyinstances the trees themselves were believed to possess the attributes of divinepower and intelligence, and therefore supplications were often addressed tothem. The beauty, dignity, massiveness, and strength of oaks, elms, and cedarsled to their adoption as symbols of power, integrity, permanence, virility, anddivine protection.Several ancient peoples—notably the Hindus and Scandinavians—regarded theMacrocosm, or Grand Universe, as a divine tree growing from a single seed sownin space. The Greeks, Persians, Chaldeans, and Japanese have legends describingthe axle tree or reed upon which the earth revolves. Kapila declares theuniverse to be the eternal tree, Brahma, which springs from an imperceptible andintangible seed—the material monad. The mediaeval Qabbalists representedcreation as a tree with its roots in the reality of spirit and its branches inthe illusion of tangible existence. The Sephirothic tree of the Qabbalah wastherefore inverted, with its roots in heaven and its branches upon the earth.Madam Blavatsky notes that the Great Pyramid was considered to be a symbol ofthis inverted tree, with its root at the apex of the pyramid and its branchesdiverging in four streams towards the base.The Scandinavian world-tree, Yggdrasil, supports on its branches nine spheres orworlds, which the Egyptians symbolized by the nine stamens of the persea oravocado. All of these are enclosed within the mysterious tenth sphere or cosmicegg—the definitionless Cipher of the Mysteries. The Qabbalistic tree of the Jewsalso consists of nine branches, or worlds, emanating from the First Cause orCrown, which surrounds its emanations as the shell surrounds the egg. The singlesource of life and the endless diversity of its expression has a perfect analogyin the structure of the tree. The trunk represents the single origin of alldiversity; the roots, deeply imbedded in the dark earth, are symbolic of divinenutriment; and its multiplicity of branches spreading from the central trunkrepresent the infinity of universal effects dependent upon a single cause.The tree has also been accepted as symbolic of the Microcosm, that is, man.According to the esoteric doctrine, man first exists potentially within the bodyof the world-tree and later blossoms forth into objective manifestation upon itsbranches. According to an early Greek Mystery myth, the god Zeus fabricated thethird race of men from ash trees. The serpent so often shown wound around thetrunk of the tree usually signifies the mind—the power of thought—and is theeternal tempter or urge which leads all rational creatures to the ultimatediscovery of reality and thus overthrows the rule of the gods. The serpenthidden in the foliage of the universal tree represents the cosmic mind; and inthe human tree, the individualized intellect.The concept that all life originates from seeds caused grain and various plantsto be accepted as emblematic of the human spermatozoon, and the tree wastherefore symbolic of organized life unfolding from its primitive germ. Thegrowth of the universe from its primitive seed may be likened to the growth ofthe mighty oak from the tiny acorn. While the tree is apparently much greaterthan its own source, nevertheless that source contains potentially every branch,twig, and leaf which will later be objectively unfolded by the processes ofgrowth.Man’s veneration for trees as symbols of the abstract qualities of wisdom andintegrity also led him to designate as trees those individuals who possessedthese divine qualities to an apparently superhuman degree. Highly illuminedphilosophers and priests were therefore often referred to as trees or treemen-for example, the Druids, whose name, according to one interpretation,signifies the men of the oak trees, or the initiates of certain Syrian Mysterieswho were called cedars; in fact it is far more credible and probable that thefamous cedars of Lebanon, cut down for the building of King Solomon’s Temple,were really illumined, initiated sages. The mystic knows that the true supportsof God’s Glorious House were not the logs subject to decay but the immortal andimperishable intellects of the tree hierophants.Trees are repeatedly mentioned in the Old and New Testaments, and in thescriptures of various pagan nations. The Tree of Life and the Tree of theKnowledge of Good and Evil mentioned in Genesis, the burning bush in which theangel appeared to Moses, the famous vine and fig tree of the New Testament, thegrove of olives in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus went to pray, and themiraculous tree of Revelation which bore twelve manners of fruit and whoseleaves were for the healing of the nations, all bear witness to the esteem inwhich trees were held by the scribes of Holy Writ. Buddha received hisillumination while under the bodhi tree, near Madras in India, and several ofthe Eastern gods are pictured sitting in meditation beneath the spreadingbranches of mighty trees. Many of the great sages and saviors carried wands,rods, or staves cut from the wood of sacred trees, as the rods of Moses andAaron; Gungnir—the spear of Odin—cut from the Tree of Life; and the consecratedrod of Hermes, around which the fighting serpents entwined themselves.The numerous uses which the ancients made of the tree and its products arefactors in its symbolism. Its worship was, to a certain degree, based upon itsusefulness. Of this J. P. Lundy writes: “Trees occupy such an important place inthe economy of nature by way of attracting and retaining moisture, and shadingthe water-sources and the soil so as to prevent barrenness and desolation; theyare so useful to man for shade, for fruit, for medicine, for fuel, for buildinghouses and ships, for furniture, for almost every department of life, that it isno wonder that some of the more conspicuous ones, such as the oak, the pine, thepalm, and the sycamore, have been made sacred and used for worship.” (SeeMonumental Christianity.)The early Fathers of the church sometimes used the tree to symbolize Christ.They believed that ultimately Christianity would grow up like a mighty oak andovershadow all other faiths of mankind. Because it annually discards itsfoliage, the tree was also looked upon as an appropriate emblem of resurrectionand reincarnation, for though apparently dying each fall it blossomed forthagain with renewed verdure each ensuing spring.Under the appellations of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Goodand Evil is concealed the great arcanum of antiquity—the mystery of equilibrium.The Tree of Life represents the spiritual point of balance—the secret ofimmortality. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, as its name implies,represents polarity, or unbalance—the secret of mortality. The Qabbalists revealthis by assigning the central column of their Sephirothic diagram to the Tree ofLife and the two side branches to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.“Unbalanced forces perish in the void,” declares the secret work, and all ismade known. The apple represents the knowledge of the procreative processes, bythe awakening of which the material universe was established. The allegory ofAdam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is a cosmic myth, revealing the methods ofuniversal and individual establishment. The literal story, accepted for so manycenturies by an unthinking world, is preposterous, but the creative mystery ofwhich it is the symbol is one of Nature’s profoundest verities. The Ophites(serpent worshipers) revered the Edenic snake because it was the cause ofindividual existence. Though humanity is still wandering in a world of good andevil, it will ultimately attain completion and eat of the fruit of the Tree ofLife growing in the midst of the illusionary garden of worldly things. Thus theTree of Life is also the appointed symbol of the Mysteries, and by partaking ofits fruit man attains immortality.The oak, the pine, the ash, the cypress, and the palm are the five trees ofgreatest symbolic importance. The Father God of the Mysteries was oftenworshiped under the form of an oak; the Savior God—frequently the WorldMartyr—in the form of a pine; the world axis and the divine nature in humanityin the form of an ash; the goddesses, or maternal principle, in the form of acypress; and the positive pole of generation in the form of the inflorescence ofthe male date palm. The pine cone is a phallic symbol of remote antiquity. Thethyrsus of Bacchus—a long wand or staff surmounted by a pine cone or cluster ofgrapes and entwined with ivy or grape-vine leaves, sometimes ribbons—signifiesthat the wonders of Nature may only be accomplished by the aid of solarvirility, as symbolized by the cone or grapes. In the Phrygian Mysteries,Atys—the ever-present sun-savior—dies under the branches of the pine tree (anallusion to the solar globe at the winter solstice) and for this reason the pinetree was sacred to his cult. This tree was also sacred in the Mysteries ofDionysos and Apollo.Among the ancient Egyptians and Jews the acacia, or tamarisk, was held in thehighest religious esteem; and among modern Masons, branches of acacia, cypress,cedar, or evergreen are still regarded as most significant emblems. Theshittim-wood used by the children of Israel in the construction of theTabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant was a species of acacia. In describingthis sacred tree, Albert Pike has written: “The genuine acacia, also, is thethorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew around the body of Osiris. It was asacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammeddestroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur; and of it the ‘crownof thorns’ was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. Itis a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of life; for it has beenknown, when planted as a door-post, to take root again and shoot out buddingboughs above the threshhold.” (See Morals and Dogma.)It is quite possible that much of the veneration accorded the acacia is due tothe peculiar attributes of the mimosa, or sensitive plant, with which it wasoften identified by the ancients. There is a Coptic legend to the effect thatthe sensitive plant was the first of all trees or shrubs to worship Christ. Therapid growth of the acacia and its beauty have also caused it to be regarded asemblematic of fecundity and generation.The symbolism of the acacia is susceptible of four distinct interpretations: (1)it is the emblem of the vernal equinox—the annual resurrection of the solardeity; (2) under the form of the sensitive plant which shrinks from human touch,the acacia signifies purity and innocence, as one of the Greek meanings of itsname implies; (3) it fittingly typifies human immortality and regeneration, andunder the form of the evergreen represents that immortal part of man whichsurvives the destruction of his visible nature; (4) it is the ancient andrevered emblem of the Mysteries, and candidates entering the tortuouspassageways in which the ceremonials were given carried in their hands branchesof these sacred plants or small clusters of sanctified flowers.Albert G. Mackey calls attention to the fact that each of the ancient Mysterieshad its own peculiar plant sacred to the gods or goddesses in whose honor therituals were celebrated. These sacred plants were later adopted as the symbolsof the various degrees in which they were used. Thus, in the Mysteries ofAdonis, lettuce was sacred; in the Brahmin and Egyptian rites, the lotus; amongthe Druids, the mistletoe; and among certain of the Greek Mysteries, the myrtle.(See Encyclopœdia of Freemasonry. )As the legend of CHiram Abiff is based upon the ancient Egyptian Mystery ritualof the murder and resurrection of Osiris, it is natural that the sprig of acaciashould be preserved as symbolic of the resurrection of CHiram. The chestcontaining the body of Osiris was washed ashore near Byblos and lodged in theroots of a tamarisk, or acacia, which, growing into a mighty tree, enclosedwithin its trunk the body of the murdered god. This is undoubtedly the origin ofthe story that a sprig of acacia marks the grave of CHiram. The mystery of theevergreen marking the grave of the dead sun god is also perpetuated in theChristmas tree.The apricot and quince are familiar yonic symbols, while the bunch of grapes andthe fig are phallic. The pomegranate is the mystic fruit of the Eleusinianrites; by eating it, Prosperine bound herself to the realms of Pluto. The fruithere signifies the sensuous life which, once tasted, temporarily deprives man ofimmortality. Also on account of its vast number of seeds the pomegranate wasoften employed to represent natural fecundity. For the same reason, Jacob Bryantin his Ancient Mythology notes that the ancients recognized in this fruit anappropriate emblem of the Ark of the Deluge, which contained the seeds of thenew human race. Among the ancient Mysteries the pomegranate was also consideredto be a divine symbol of such peculiar significance that its true explanationcould not be divulged. It was termed by the Cabiri “the forbidden secret.” ManyGreek gods and goddesses are depicted holding the fruit or flower of thepomegranate in their hands, evidently to signify that they are givers of lifeand plenty. Pomegranate capitals were placed upon the pillars of Jachin and Boazstanding in front of King Solomon’s Temple; and by the order of Jehovah,pomegranate blossoms were embroidered upon the bottom of the High Priest’sephod.Strong wine made from the juice of the grape was looked upon as symbolic of thefalse life and false light of the universe, for it was produced by a falseprocess—artificial fermentation. The rational faculties are clouded by strongdrink, and the animal nature, liberated from bondage, controls theIndividual—facts which necessarily were of the greatest spiritual significance.As the lower nature is the eternal tempter seeking to lead man into excesseswhich inhibit the spiritual faculties, the grape and its product were used tosymbolize the Adversary.The juice of the grape was thought by the Egyptians to resemble human blood moreclosely than did any other substance. In fact, they believed that the grapesecured its life from the blood of the dead who had been buried in the earth.According to Plutarch, “The priests of the sun at Heliopolis never carry anywine into their temples, * * * and if they made use of it at any time in theirlibations to the gods, it was not because they looked upon it as in its ownnature acceptable to them; but they poured it upon their altars as the blood ofthose enemies who formerly had fought against them. For they look upon the vineto have first sprung out of the earth after it was fattened with the carcassesof those who fell in the wars against the gods. And this, say they, is thereason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and besidethemselves, filling than as it were with the blood of their own ancestors. (SeeIsis and Osiris.)Among some cults the state of intoxication was viewed as a condition somewhatakin to ecstasy, for the individual was believed to be possessed by theUniversal Spirit of Life, whose chosen vehicle was the vine. In the Mysteries,the grape was often used to symbolize lust and debauchery because of itsdemoralizing effect upon the emotional nature. The fact was recognized, however,that fermentation was the certain evidence of the presence of the solar fire,hence the grape was accepted as the proper symbol of the Solar Spirit—the giverof divine enthusiasm. In a somewhat similar manner, Christians have acceptedwine as the emblem of the blood of Christ, partaking of it in Holy Communion.Christ, the exoteric emblem of the Solar Spirit, said, “I am the vine.” He wastherefore worshiped with the wine of ecstasy in the same manner as were hispagan prototypes—Bacchus, Dionysos, Atys, and Adonis.The mandragora officinarum, or mandrake, is accredited with possessing the mostremarkable magical powers. Its narcotic properties were recognized by theGreeks, who employed it to deaden pain during surgical operations, and it hasbeen identified also with baaras, the mystic herb used by the Jews for castingout demons. In the Jewish Wars, Josephus describes the method of securing thebaaras, which he declares emits flashes of lightning and destroys all who seekto touch it, unless they proceed according to certain rules supposedlyformulated by King Solomon himself.The occult properties of the mandrake, while little understood, have beenresponsible for the adoption of the plant as a talisman capable of increasingthe value or quantity of anything with which it was associated. As a phalliccharm, the mandrake was considered to be an infallible cure for sterility. Itwas one of the Priapic symbols which the Knights Templars were accused ofworshiping. The root of the plant closely resembles a human body and often borethe outlines of the human head, arms, or legs. This striking similarity betweenthe body of man and the mandragora is one of the puzzles of natural science andis the real basis for the veneration in which this plant was held. In IsisUnveiled, Madam Blavatsky notes that the mandragora seems to occupy upon earththe point where the vegetable and animal kingdoms meet, as the zoophites andpolypi do in the sea. This thought opens a vast field of speculation concerningthe nature of this animal-plant.According to a popular superstition, the mandrake shrank from being touched and,crying out with a human voice, clung desperately to the soil in which it wasimbedded. Anyone who heard its cry while plucking it either immediately died orwent mad. To circumvent this tragedy, it was customary to dig around the rootsof the mandrake until the plant was thoroughly loosened and then to tie one endof a cord about the stalk and fasten the other end to a dog. The dog, obeyinghis master’s call, thereupon dragged the root from the earth and became thevictim of the mandragora curse. When once uprooted, the plant could be handledwith immunity.During the Middle Ages, mandrake charms brought great prices and an art wasevolved by which the resemblance between the mandragora root and the human bodywas considerably accentuated. Like most superstitions, the belief in thepeculiar powers of the mandrake was founded upon an ancient secret doctrineconcerning the true nature of the plant. “It is slightly narcotic,” says ElpihasLevi, “and an aphrodisiacal virtue was ascribed to it by the ancients, whorepresented it as being sought by Thessalian sorcerers for the composition ofphiltres. Is this root the umbilical vestige of our terrestrial origin, as acertain magical mysticism has suggested? We dare not affirm it seriously, but itis true all the same that man issued from the slime of earth and his firstappearance must have been in the form of a rough sketch. The analogies of Naturecompel us to admit the notion, at least as a possibility. The first men were, inthis case, a family of gigantic, sensitive mandrogores, animated by the sun, whorooted themselves up from the earth.” (See Transcendental Magic.)The homely onion was revered by the Egyptians as a symbol of the universebecause its rings and layers represented the concentric planes into whichcreation was divided according to the Hermetic Mysteries. It was also regardedas possessing great medicinal virtue. Because of peculiar properties resultingfrom its pungency, the garlic plant was a powerful agent in transcendentalmagic. To this day no better medium has been found for the treatment ofobsession. Vampirism and certain forms of insanity—especially those resultingfrom mediumship and the influences of elemental larvæ—respond immediately to theuse of garlic. In the Middle Ages, its presence in a house was believed to wardoff all evil powers.Trifoliate plants, such as the shamrock, were employed by many religious cultsto represent the principle of the Trinity. St. Patrick is supposed to have usedthe shamrock to illustrate this doctrine of the triune Divinity. The reason forthe additional sanctity conferred by a fourth leaf is that the fourth principleof the Trinity is man, and the presence of this leaf therefore signifies theredemption of humanity.Wreaths were worn during initiation into the Mysteries and the reading of thesacred books to signify that these processes were consecrated to the deities. Onthe symbolism of wreaths, Richard Payne Knight writes: “Instead of beads,wreaths of foliage, generally of laurel, olive, myrtle, ivy, or oak, appear uponcoins, sometimes encircling the symbolical figures, and sometimes as chapletsupon their heads. All these were sacred to some peculiar personifications of thedeity, and significant of some particular attributes, and, in general, allevergreens were Dionysiac plants; that is, symbols of the generative power,signifying perpetuity of youth and vigor, as the circles of beads and diademssignify perpetuity of existence.” (See Symbolical Language of Ancient Art andMythology.)"},{"pageContent":"XXI Stones, metals, and gems Cach of the four primary elements as taught by the early philosophers has itsanalogue in the quaternary terrestrial constitution of man. The rocks and earthcorrespond to the bones and flesh; the water to the various fluids; the air tothe gases; and the fire to the bodily heat. Since the bones are the frameworkthat sustains the corporeal structure, they may be regarded as a fitting emblemof the spirit—that divine foundation which supports the composite fabric ofmind, soul, and body. To the initiate, the skeleton of death holding in bonyfingers the reaper’s scythe denotes Saturn (Kronos), the father of the gods,carrying the sickle with which he mutilated Ouranos, his own sire.In the language of the Mysteries, the spirits of men are the powdered bones ofSaturn. The latter deity was always worshiped under the symbol of the base orfooting, inasmuch as he was considered to be the substructure upholdingcreation. The myth of Saturn has its historical basis in the fragmentary recordspreserved by the early Greeks and Phœnicians concerning a king by that name whoruled over the ancient continent of Hyperborea. Polaris, Hyperborea, andAtlantis, because they lie buried beneath the continents and oceans of themodern world, have frequently been symbolized as rocks supporting upon theirbroad surfaces new lands, races, and empires. According to the ScandinavianMysteries, the stones and cliffs were formed from the bones of Ymir, theprimordial giant of the seething clay, while to the Hellenic mystics the rockswere the bones of the Great Mother, Gaea.After the deluge sent by the gods to destroy mankind at the close of the IronAge, only Deucalion and Pyrrha were left alive. Entering a ruined sanctuary topray, they were directed by an oracle to depart from the temple and with headsveiled and garments unbound cast behind them the bones of their mother.Construing the cryptic message of the god to mean that the earth was the GreatMother of all creatures, Deucalion picked up loose rocks and, bidding Pyrrha dolikewise, cast them behind him. From these rocks there sprang forth a new andstalwart race of human beings, the rocks thrown by Deucalion becoming men andthose thrown by Pyrrha becoming women. In this allegory is epitomized themystery of human evolution; for spirit, by ensouling matter, becomes thatindwelling power which gradually but sequentially raises the mineral to thestates of the plant; the plant to the plane of the animal; the animal to thedignity of man; and man to the estate of the gods.The solar system was organized by forces operating inward from the great ring ofthe Saturnian sphere; and since the beginnings of all things were under thecontrol of Saturn, the most reasonable inference is that the first forms ofworship were dedicated to him and his peculiar symbol—the stone. Thus theintrinsic nature of Saturn is synonymous with that spiritual rock which is theenduring foundation of the Solar Temple, and has its antitype or lower octave inthat terrestrial rock—the planet Earth—which sustains upon its jagged surfacethe diversified genera of mundane life.Although its origin is uncertain, litholatry undoubtedly constitutes one of theearliest forms of religious expression. “Throughout all the world,” writesGodfrey Higgins, “the first object of Idolatry seems to have been a plain,unwrought stone, placed in the ground, as an emblem of the generative orprocreative powers of nature.” (See The Celtic Druids.) Remnants of stoneworship are distributed over the greater part of the earth’s surface, a notableexample being the menhirs at Carnac, in Brittany, where several thousandgigantic uncut stones are arranged in eleven orderly rows. Many of thesemonoliths stand over twenty feet out of the sand in which they are embedded, andit has been calculated that some of the larger ones weigh as much as 250,000pounds. By some it is believed that certain of the menhirs mark the location ofburied treasure, but the most plausible view is that which regards Carnac as amonument to the astronomical knowledge of antiquity. Scattered throughout theBritish Isles and Europe, these cairns, dolmens, menhirs, and cistvaens stand asmute but eloquent testimonials to the existence and achievements of races nowextinct.Of particular interest are the rocking or logan stones, which evince themechanical skill of these early peoples. These relics consist of enormousboulders poised upon one or two small points in such a manner that the slightestpressure will sway them, but the greatest effort is not sufficient to overthrowthem. These were called living stones by the Greeks and Latins, the most famousone being the Gygorian stone in the Strait of Gibraltar. Though so perfectlybalanced that it could be moved with the stalk of a daffodil, this rock couldnot be upset by the combined weight of many men. There is a legend that Herculesraised a rocking stone over the graves of the two sons of Boreas whom he hadkilled in combat. This stone was so delicately poised that it swayed back andforth with the wind, but no application of force could overturn it. A number oflogan stones have been found in Britain, traces of one no longer standing havingbeen discovered in Stonehenge. (See The Celtic Druids.) It is interesting tonote that the green stones forming the inner ring of Stonehenge are believed tohave been brought from Africa.In many cases the monoliths are without carving or inscription, for theyundoubtedly antedate both the use of tools and the art of writing. In someinstances the stones have been trued into columns or obelisks, as in the runicmonuments and the Hindu Lingams and sakti stones; in other instances they arefashioned into rough likenesses of the human body, as in the Easter Islandstatues, or into the elaborately sculptured figures of the Central AmericanIndians and the Khmers of Cambodia. The first rough-stone images can hardly beconsidered as effigies of any particular deity but rather as the crude effort ofprimitive man to portray in the enduring qualities of stone the procreativeattributes of abstract Divinity. An instinctive recognition of the stability ofDeity has persisted through all the intervening ages between primitive man andmodern civilization. Ample proof of the survival of litholatry in the Christianfaith is furnished by allusions to the rock of refuge, the rock upon which thechurch of Christ was to be founded, the corner stone which the buildersrejected, Jacob’s stony pillow which he set up and anointed with oil, the slingstone of David, the rock Moriah upon which the altar of King Solomon’s Templewas erected, the white stone of Revelation, and the Rock of Ages.Stones were highly venerated by prehistoric peoples primarily because of theirusefulness. Jagged bits of stone were probably man’s first weapons; rocky cliffsand crags constituted his first fortifications, and from these vantage points hehurled loose boulders down upon marauders. In caverns or rude huts fashionedfrom slabs of rock the first humans protected themselves from the rigors of theelements. Stones were set up as markers and monuments to primitive achievement;they were also placed upon the graves of the dead, probably as a precautionarymeasure to prevent the depredations of wild beasts. During migrations, it wasapparently customary for primitive peoples to carry about with them stones takenfrom their original habitat. As the homeland or birthplace of a race wasconsidered sacred, these stones were emblematic of that universal regard sharedby all nations for the place of their geniture. The discovery that fire could beproduced by striking together two pieces of stone augmented man’s reverence forstones, but ultimately the hitherto unsuspected world of wonders opened by thenewly discovered element of fire caused pyrolatry to supplant stone worship. Thedark, cold Father—stone—gave birth out of itself to the bright, glowingSun—fire; and the newly born flame, by displacing its parent, became the mostimpressive and mysterious of all religio-philosophic symbols, widespread andenduring through the ages.The body of every thing was likened to a rock, trued either into a cube or moreornately chiseled to form a pedestal, while the spirit of every thing waslikened to the elaborately carved figure surmounting it. Accordingly, altarswere erected as a symbol of the lower world, and fires were kept burning uponthem to represent that spiritual essence illuminating the body it surmounted.The square is actually one surface of a cube, its corresponding figure in planegeometry, and its proper philosophic symbol. Consequently, when considering theearth as an element and not as a body, the Greeks, Brahmins, and Egyptiansalways referred to its four corners, although they were fully aware that theplanet itself was a sphere.Because their doctrines were the sure foundation of all knowledge and the firststep in the attainment of conscious immortality, the Mysteries were oftenrepresented as cubical or pyramidal stones. Conversely, these stories themselvesbecame the emblem of that condition of self-achieved godhood. The unchange-ability of the stone made it an appropriate emblem of God—the immovable andunchangeable Source of Existence—and also of the divine sciences—the eternalrevelation of Himself to mankind. As the personification of the rationalintellect, which is the true foundation of human life, Mercury, or Hermes, wassymbolized in a like manner. Square or cylindrical pillars, surmounted by abearded head of Hermes and called hermæ, were set up in public places. Terminus,a form of Jupiter and god of boundaries and highways, from whose name is derivedthe modern word terminal, was also symbolized by an upright stone, sometimesornamented with the head of the god, which was placed at the borders ofprovinces and the intersections of important roads.The philosopher’s stone is really the philosophical stone, for philosophy istruly likened to a magic jewel whose touch transmutes base substances intopriceless gems like itself. Wisdom is the alchemist’s powder of projection whichtransforms many thousand times its own weight of gross ignorance into theprecious substance of enlightenment."},{"pageContent":"THE TABLETS OF THE LAW While upon the heights of Mount Sinai, Moses received from Jehovah two tabletsbearing the characters of the Decalogue traced by the very finger of Israel’sGod. These tables were fashioned from the divine sapphire, Schethiyâ, which theMost High, after removing from His own throne, had cast into the Abyss to becomethe foundation and generator of the worlds. This sacred stone, formed ofheavenly dew, was sundered by the breath of God, and upon the two parts weredrawn in black fire the figures of the Law. These precious inscriptions, aglowwith celestial splendor, were delivered by the Lord on the Sabbath day into thehands of Moses, who was able to read the illumined letters from the reverse sidebecause of the transparency of the great jewel. (See The Secret Doctrine inIsrael or The Zohar for details of this legend.)The Ten Commandments are the ten shining gems placed by the Holy One in thesapphire sea of Being, and in the depths of matter the reflections of thesejewels are seen as the laws governing the sublunary spheres. They are the sacredten by which the Supreme Deity has stamped His will upon the face of Nature.This same decad was celebrated by the Pythagoreans under the form of thetetractys—that triangle of spermatic points which reveals to the initiated thewhole working of the cosmic scheme; for ten is the number of perfection, the keyto creation, and the proper symbol of God, man, and the universe.Because of the idolatry of the Israelites, Moses deemed the people unworthy toreceive the sapphire tables; hence he destroyed them, that the Mysteries ofJehovah should not be violated. For the original set Moses substituted twotablets of rough stone into the surface of which he had cut ten ancient letters.While the former tables—partaking of the divinity of the Tree of Life—blazedforth eternal verities, the latter—partaking of the nature of the Tree of Goodand Evil—revealed only temporal truths. Thus the ancient tradition of Israelreturned again to heaven, leaving only its shadow with the children of thetwelve tribes.One of the two tables of stone delivered by the Lawgiver to his followers stoodfor the oral, the other for the written traditions upon which the RabbinicalSchool was founded. Authorities differ widely as to the size and substance ofthe inferior tables. Some describe them as being so small that they could beheld in the hollow of a man’s hand; others declare that each table was ten ortwelve cubits in length and of enormous weight. A few even deny that the tableswere of stone, maintaining that they were of a wood called sedr, which,according to the Mohammedans, grows profusely in Paradise.The two tables signify respectively the superior and the inferior worlds— thepaternal and the maternal formative principles. In their undivided state theypresent the Cosmic Androgyne. The breaking of the tables signifies obscurely theseparation of the superior and the inferior spheres and also the division of thesexes. In the religious processionals of the Greeks and Egyptians an ark or shipwas carried which contained stone tablets, cones, and vessels of various shapesemblematic of the procreative processes. The Ark of the Israelites—which waspatterned after the sacred chests of the Isiac Mysteries—contained three holyobjects, each having an important phallic interpretation: the pot of manna, therod that budded, and the Tablets of the Law—the first, second, and thirdPrinciples of the Creative Triad. The manna, the blossoming staff, and the stonetables are also appropriate images respectively of the Qabbalah, the Mishna, andthe written law—the spirit, soul, and body of Judaism. When placed in KingSolomon’s Everlasting House, the Ark of the Covenant contained only the Tabletsof the Law. Does this indicate that even at that early date the secret traditionhad been lost and the letter of the revelation alone remained?As representing the power that fabricated the lower, or Demiurgic, sphere, thetablets of stone were sacred to Jehovah in contradistinction to the tablets ofsapphire that signified the potency that established the higher, or celestial,sphere. Without doubt the Mosaic tablets have their prototype in the stonepillars or obelisks placed on either side of the entrance to pagan temples.These columns may pertain to that remote time when men worshiped the Creatorthrough His zodiacal sign of Gemini, the symbol of which is still the phallicpillars of the Celestial Twins. “The Ten Commandments,” writes HargraveJennings, “are inscribed in two groups of five each, in columnar form. The fiveto the right (looking from the altar) mean the ‘Law’; the five to the left meanthe ‘Prophets.’ The right stone is masculine, the left stone is feminine. Theycorrespond to the two disjoined pillars of stone (or towers) in the front ofevery cathedral, and of every temple in the heathen times.” (See TheRosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries.) The same author states that the Law ismasculine because it was delivered direct from the Deity, while the Prophets, orGospels, were feminine because born through the nature of man.The right Tablet of the Law further signifies Jachin—the white pillar of light;the left Tablet, Boaz—the shadowy pillar of darkness. These were the names ofthe two pillars cast from brass set up on the porch of King Solomon’s Temple.They were eighteen cubits in height and beautifully ornamented with wreaths ofchainwork, nets, and pomegranates. On the top of each pillar was a largebowl—now erroneously called a ball or globe—one of the bowls probably containingfire and the other water. The celestial globe (originally the bowl of fire),surmounting the right-hand column (Jachin), symbolized the divine man; theterrestrial globe (the bowl of water), surmounting the left-hand column (Boaz),signified the earthly man. These two pillars respectively connote also theactive and the passive expressions of Divine Energy, the sun and the moon,sulphur and salt, good and bad, light and darkness. Between them is the doorleading into the House of God, and standing thus at the gates of Sanctuary theyare a reminder that Jehovah is both an androgynous and an anthropomorphic deity.As two parallel columns they denote the zodiacal signs of Cancer and Capricorn,which were formerly placed in the chamber of initiation to represent birth anddeath—the extremes of physical life. They accordingly signify the summer and thewinter solstices, now known to Freemasons under the comparatively modernappellation of the “two St. Johns.”In the mysterious Sephirothic Tree of the Jews, these two pillars symbolizeMercy and Severity. Standing before the gate of King Solomon’s Temple, thesecolumns had the same symbolic import as the obelisks before the sanctuaries ofEgypt. When interpreted Qabbalistically, the names of the two pillars mean “Instrength shall My House be established.” In the splendor of mental and spiritualillumination, the High Priest stood between the pillars as a mute witness to theperfect virtue of equilibrium—that hypothetical point equidistant from allextremes. He thus personified the divine nature of man in the midst of hiscompound constitution—the mysterious Pythagorean Monad in the presence of theDuad. On one side towered the stupendous column of the intellect; on the other,the brazen pillar of the flesh. Midway between these two stands the glorifiedwise man, but he cannot reach this high estate without first suffering upon thecross made by joining these pillars together. The early Jews occasionallyrepresented the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, as the legs of Jehovah, therebysignifying to the modern philosopher that Wisdom and Love, in their most exaltedsense, support the whole order of creation—both mundane and supermundane."},{"pageContent":"THE HOLY GRAIL Like the sapphire Schethiyâ, the Lapis Exilis, crown jewel of the ArchangelLucifer, fell from heaven. Michael, archangel of the sun and the Hidden God ofIsrael, at the head of the angelic hosts swooped down upon Lucifer and hislegions of rebellious spirits. During the conflict, Michael with his flamingsword struck the flashing Lapis Exilis from the coronet of his adversary, andthe green stone fell through all the celestial rings into the dark andimmeasurable Abyss. Out of Lucifer’s radiant gem was fashioned the Sangreal, orHoly Grail, from which Christ is said to have drunk at the Last Supper.Though some controversy exists as to whether the Grail was a cup or a platter,it is generally depicted in art as a chalice of considerable size and unusualbeauty. According to the legend, Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail Cup tothe place of the crucifixion and in it caught the blood pouring from the woundsof the dying Nazarene. Later Joseph, who had become custodian of the sacredrelics—the Sangreal and the Spear of Longinus—carried them into a distantcountry. According to one version, his descendants finally placed these relicsin Glastonbury Abbey in England; according to another, in a wonderful castle onMount Salvat, Spain, built by angels in a single night. Under the name ofPrester John, Parsifal, the last of the Grail Kings, carried the Holy Cup withhim into India, and it disappeared forever from the Western World. Subsequentsearch for the Sangreal was the motif for much of the knight-errantry of theArthurian legends and the ceremonials of the Round Table. (See the Morted’Arthur.)No adequate interpretation has ever been given to the Grail Mysteries. Somebelieve the Knights of the Holy Grail to have been a powerful organization ofChristian mystics perpetuating the Ancient Wisdom under the rituals andsacraments of the oracular Cup. The quest for the Holy Grail is the eternalsearch for truth, and Albert G. Mackey sees in it a variation of the Masoniclegend of the Lost Word so long sought by the brethren of the Craft. There isalso evidence to support the claim that the story of the Grail is an elaborationof an early pagan Nature myth which has been preserved by reason of the subtlemanner in which it was engrafted upon the cult of Christianity. From thisparticular viewpoint, the Holy Grail is undoubtedly a type of the ark or vesselin which the life of the world is preserved and therefore is significant of thebody of the Great Mother—Nature. Its green color relates it to Venus and to themystery of generation; also to the Islamic faith, whose sacred color is greenand whose Sabbath is Friday, the day of Venus.The Holy Grail is a symbol both of the lower (or irrational) world and of thebodily nature of man, because both are receptacles for the living essences ofthe superior worlds. Such is the mystery of the redeeming blood which,descending into the condition of death, overcomes the last enemy by ensoulingall substance with its own immortality. To the Christian, whose mystic faithespecially emphasizes the love element, the Holy Grail typifies the heart inwhich continually swirls the living water of eternal life. Moreover, to theChristian, the search for the Holy Grail is the search for the real Self which,when found, is the consummation of the magnum opus.The Holy Cup can be discovered only by those who have raised themselves abovethe limitations of sensuous existence. In his mystic poem, The Vision of SirLaunfal, James Russell Lowell discloses the true nature of the Holy Grail byshowing that it is visible only to a certain state of spiritual consciousness.Only upon returning from the vain pursuit of haughty ambition did the aged andbroken knight see in the transformed leper’s cup the glowing chalice of hislifelong dream. Some writers trace a similarity between the Grail legend and thestories of the martyred Sun Gods whose blood, descending from heaven into theearth, was caught in the cup of matter and liberated therefrom by the initiatoryrites. The Holy Grail may also be the seed pod so frequently employed in theancient Mysteries as an emblem of germination and resurrection; and if thecuplike shape of the Grail be derived from the flower, it signifies theregeneration and spiritualization of the generative forces in man.There are many accounts of stone images which, because of the substancesentering into their composition and the ceremonials attendant upon theirconstruction, were ensouled by the divinities whom they were created toresemble. To such images were ascribed various human faculties and powers, suchas speech, thought, and even motion. While renegade priests doubtless resortedto trickery—an instance of which is related in a curious apocryphal fragmententitled Bel and the Dragon and supposedly deleted from the end of the Book ofDaniel—many of the phenomena recorded in connection with sanctified statues andrelics can hardly be explained unless the work of supernatural agencies beadmitted.History records the existence of stones which, when struck, threw all who heardthe sound into a state of ecstasy. There were also echoing images whichwhispered for hours after the room itself had become silent, and musical stonesproductive of the sweetest harmonies. In recognition of the sanctity which theGreeks and Latins ascribed to stones, they placed their hands upon certainconsecrated pillars when taking an oath. In ancient times stones played a partin determining the fate of accused persons, for it was customary for juries toreach their verdicts by dropping pebbles into a bag.Divination by stones was often resorted to by the Greeks, and Helena is said tohave foretold by lithomancy the destruction of Troy. Many popular superstitionsabout stones survive the so-called Dark Ages. Chief among these is the oneconcerning the famous black stone in the seat of the coronation chair inWestminster Abbey, which is declared to be the actual rock used by Jacob as apillow. The black stone also appears several times in religious symbolism. Itwas called Helio- gabalus, a word presumably derived from Elagabal, theSyro-Phœnician sun god. This stone was sacred to the sun and declared to possessgreat and diversified properties. The black stone in the Caaba at Mecca is stillrevered throughout the Mohammedan world. It is said to have been whiteoriginally and of such brilliancy that it could be seen many days’ journey fromMecca, but as ages passed it became blackened by the tears of pilgrims and thesins of the world."},{"pageContent":"THE MAGIC OF METALS AND GEMS According to the teachings of the Mysteries, the rays of the celestial bodies,striking the crystallizing influences of the lower world, become the variouselements. Partaking of the astral virtues of their source, these elementsneutralize certain unbalanced forms of celestial activity and, when properlycombined, contribute much to the well-being of man. Little is known todayconcerning these magical properties, but the modern world may yet find itprofitable to consider the findings of the early philosophers who determinedthese relationships by extensive experimentation. Out of such research arose thepractice of identifying the metals with the bones of the various deities. Forexample, the Egyptians, according to Manetho, considered iron to be the bone ofMars and the lodestone the bone of Horus. By analogy, lead would be the physicalskeleton of Saturn, copper of Venus, quicksilver of Mercury, gold of the sun,silver of the moon, and antimony of the earth. It is possible that uranium willprove to be the metal of Uranus and radium to be the metal of Neptune.The four Ages of the Greek mystics—the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the BronzeAge, and the Iron Age—are metaphoric expressions referring to the four majorperiods in the life of all things. In the divisions of the day they signifydawn, midday, sunset, and midnight; in the duration of gods, men, and universes,they denote the periods of birth, growth, maturity, and decay. The Greek Agesalso bear a close correspondence to the four Yugas of the Hindus: Krita-Yuga,Treta-Yuga, Dvapara-Yuga, and Kali-Yuga. Their method of calculation isdescribed by Ullamudeian as follows; “In each of the 12 signs there are 1800minutes; multiply this number by 12 you have 21600; e.g. 1800 × 12=21600.Multiply this 21600 by 80 and it will give 1,728,000, which is the duration ofthe first age, called Krita-Υuga. If the same number be multiplied by 60, itwill give 1,296,000, the years of the second age, Treta-Yuga. The same numbermultiplied by 40 gives 864,000, the length of the third age, Dvapara-Yuga. Thesame multiplied by 20 gives 432,000, the fourth age, Kali-Υuga.” (It will benoted that these multipliers decrease in inverse ratio to the Pythagoreantetractys: 1, 2, 3, and 4.)H. P. Blavatsky declares that Orpheus taught his followers how to affect a wholeaudience by means of a lodestone, and that Pythagoras paid particular attentionto the color and nature of precious stones. She adds: “The Buddhists assert thatthe sapphire produces peace of mind, equanimity, and chases all evil thoughts byestablishing a healthy circulation in man. So does an electric battery, with itswell-directed fluid, say our electricians. ‘The sapphire,’ say the Buddhists,‘will open barred doors and dwellings (for the spirit of man); it produces adesire for prayer, and brings with it more peace than any other gem; but he whowould wear it must lead a pure and oly life.“’ (See Isis Unveiled.)086 [images/00087.jpg] THE PYTHAGOREAN SIGNET RING.The number five was peculiarly associated by the Pythagoreans with the art ofhealing, and the pentagram, or five-pointed star, was to them the symbol ofhealth. The above figure represents a magical ring set with a talismanic gembearing the pentalpha, or star formed by five different positions of the GreekAlpha. On this subject Albert Mackey writes: “The disciples of Pythagoras, whowere indeed its real inventors, placed within each of its interior angles one ofthe letters of the Greek word ΥΓEIA or the Latin one SALUS, both of whichsignify health; and thus it was made the talisman of health. They placed it atthe beginning of their epistles as a greeting to invoke a secure health to theircorrespondent. But its use was not confined to the disciples of Pythagoras. As atalisman, it was employed all over the East as a charm to resist evil spirits.” Mythology abounds with accounts of magical rings and talismanic jewels. In thesecond book of his Republic, Plato describes a ring which, when the collet wasturned inward, rendered its wearer invisible. With this Gyges, the shepherd,secured for himself the throne of Lydia. Josephus also describes magical ringsdesigned by Moses and King Solomon, and Aristotle mentions one which broughtlove and honor to its possessor. In his chapter dealing with the subject, HenryCornelius Agrippa not only mentions the same rings, but states, upon theauthority of Philostratus Jarchus, that Apollonius of Tyana extended his life toover 130 years with the aid of seven magical rings presented to him by an EastIndian prince. Each of these seven rings was set with a gem partaking of thenature of one of the seven ruling planets of the week, and by daily changing therings Apollonius protected himself against sickness and death by theintervention of the planetary influences. The philosopher also instructed hisdisciples in the virtues of these talismanic jewels, considering suchinformation to be indispensable to the theurgist. Agrippa describes thepreparation of magical rings as follows: “When any Star [Planet] ascendsfortunately, with the fortunate aspect or conjunction of the Moon, we must takea stone and herb that is under that Star, and make a ring of the metal that issuitable to this Star, and in it fasten the stone, putting the herb or rootunder it—not omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and characters, as alsothe proper suffumigations.” (See Three Books of Occult Philosophy.)The ring has long been regarded as the symbol of attainment, perfection, andimmortality—the last because the circlet of precious metal had neither beginningnor end. In the Mysteries, rings chased to resemble a serpent with its tail inits mouth were worn by the initiates as material evidence of the positionreached by them in the order. Signet rings, engraved with certain secretemblems, were worn by the hierophants, and it was not uncommon for a messengerto prove that he was the official representative of a prince or other dignitaryby bringing with his message either an impression from his master’s ring or thesignet itself. The wedding ring originally was intended to imply that in thenature of the one who wore it the state of equilibrium and completion had beenattained. This plain band of gold therefore bore witness of the union of theHigher Self (God) with the lower self (Nature) and the ceremony consummatingthis indissoluble blending of Divinity and humanity in the one nature of theinitiated mystic constituted the hermetic marriage of the Mysteries.In describing the regalia of a magician, Eliphas Levi declares that on Sunday(the day of the sun) he should carry in his right hand a golden wand, set with aruby or chrysolite; on Monday (the day of the moon) he should wear a collar ofthree strands consisting of pearls, crystals, and selenites; on Tuesday (the dayof Mars) he should carry a wand of magnetized steel and a ring of the same metalset with an amethyst; on Wednesday (the day of Mercury) he should wear anecklace of pearls or glass beads containing mercury, and a ring set with anagate; on Thursday (the day of Jupiter) he should carry a wand of glass or resinand wear a ring set with an emerald or a sapphire; on Friday (the day of Venus)he should carry a wand of polished copper and wear a ring set with a turquoiseand a crown or diadem decorated with lapis lazuli and beryl; and on Saturday(the day of Saturn) he should carry a wand ornamented with onyx stone and wear aring set with onyx and a chain about the neck formed of lead. (See The MagicalRitual of the Sanctum Regnum.)Paracelsus, Agrippa, Kircher, Lilly, and numerous other magicians andastrologers have tabulated the gems and stones corresponding to the variousplanets and zodiacal signs. The following list has been compiled from theirwritings. To the sun is assigned the carbuncle, ruby, garnet—especially thepyrope—and other fiery stones, sometimes the diamond; to the moon, the pearl,selenite, and other forms of crystal; to Saturn, the onyx, jasper, topaz, andsometimes the lapis lazuli; to Jupiter, the sapphire, emerald, and marble; toMars, the amethyst, hyacinth, lodestone, sometimes the diamond; to Venus, theturquoise, beryl, emerald, and sometimes the pearl, alabaster, coral, andcarnelian; to Mercury, the chrysolite, agate, and variegated marble.To the zodiac the same authorities assigned the following gems and stones: ToAries the sardonyx, bloodstone, amethyst, and diamond; to Taurus the carnelian,turquoise, hyacinth, sapphire, moss agate, and emerald; to Gemini the topaz,agate, chrysoprase, crystal, and aquamarine; to Cancer the topaz, chal- cedony,black onyx, moonstone, pearl, cat’s-eye, crystal, and sometimes the emerald; toLeo the jasper, sardonyx, beryl, ruby, chrysolite, amber, tourmaline, sometimesthe diamond; to Virgo the emerald, carnelian, jade, chrysolite, and sometimesthe pink jasper and hyacinth; to Libra, the beryl, sardius, coral, lapis lazuli,opal, and sometimes the diamond; to Scorpio the amethyst, beryl, sardonyx,aquamarine, carbuncle, lodestone, topaz, and malachite; to Sagittarius thehyacinth, topaz, chrysolite, emerald, carbuncle, and turquoise; to Capricorn thechrysoprase, ruby, malachite, black onyx, white onyx, jet, and moonstone; toAquarius the crystal, sapphire, garnet, zircon, and opal; to Pisces thesapphire, jasper, chrysolite, moonstone, and amethyst.Both the magic mirror and the crystal ball are symbols little understood. Woe tothat benighted mortal who accepts literally the stories circulated concerningthem! He will discover—often at the cost of sanity and health—that sorcery andphilosophy, while often confused, have nothing in common. The Persian Magicarried mirrors as an emblem of the material sphere which reflects Divinity fromits every part. The crystal ball, long misused as a medium for the cultivationof psychical powers, is a threefold symbol: (1) it signifies the crystallineUniversal Egg in whose transparent depths creation exists; (2) it is a properfigure of Deity previous to Its immersion in matter; (3) it signifies theætheric sphere of the world in whose translucent essences is impressed andpreserved the perfect image of all terrestrial activity.Meteors, or rocks from heaven, were considered tokens of divine favor andenshrined as evidence of a pact between the gods and the community in which theyfell. Curiously marked or chipped natural stones are occasionally found. InChina there is a slab of marble the grain of which forms a perfect likeness ofthe Chinese dragon. The Oberammergau stone, chipped by Nature into a closeresemblance to the popular conception of the face of Christ, is so remarkablethat even the crowned heads of Europe requested the privilege of beholding it.Stones of such nature were held in the highest esteem among primitive peoplesand even today exert a wide influence upon the religiously-minded."},{"pageContent":"XXII Ceremonial Magic and Sorcery Ceremonial magic is the ancient art of invoking and controlling spirits by ascientific application of certain formulae. A magician, enveloped in sanctifiedvestments and carrying a wand inscribed with hieroglyphic figures, could by thepower vested in certain words and symbols control the invisible inhabitants ofthe elements and of the astral world. While the elaborate ceremonial magic ofantiquity was not necessarily evil, there arose from its perversion severalfalse schools of sorcery, or black magic.Egypt, a great center of learning and the birthplace of many arts and sciences,furnished an ideal environment for transcendental experimentation. Here theblack magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman powers untilthey had completely undermined and corrupted the morals of the primitiveMysteries. By establishing a sacerdotal caste they usurped the position formerlyoccupied by the initiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government. Thusblack magic dictated the state religion and paralyzed the intellectual andspiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete andunhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priestcraft. ThePharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council—a committee ofarchsor- cerers elevated to power by the priesthood.These sorcerers then began the systematic destruction of all keys to the ancientwisdom, so that none might have access to the knowledge necessary to reachadeptship without first becoming one of their order. They mutilated the ritualsof the Mysteries while professing to preserve them, so that even though theneophyte passed through the degrees he could not secure the knowledge to whichhe was entitled. Idolatry was introduced by encouraging the worship of theimages which in the beginning the wise had erected solely as symbols for studyand meditation. False interpretations were given to the emblems and figures ofthe Mysteries, and elaborate theologies were created to confuse the minds oftheir devotees. The masses, deprived of their birthright of understanding andgroveling in ignorance, eventually became the abject slaves of the spiritualimpostors. Superstition universally prevailed and the black magicians completelydominated national affairs, with the result that humanity still suffers from thesophistries of the priestcrafts of Atlantis and Egypt.087 [images/00088.jpg] BAPHOMET, THE GOAT OF MENDES.The practice of magic—either white or black—depends upon the ability of theadept to control the universal life force—that which Eliphas Levi calls thegreat magical agent or the astral light. By the manipulation of this fluidicessence the phenomena of transcendentalism are produced. The famoushermaphroditic Goat of Mendes was a composite creature formulated to symbolizethis astral light. It is identical with Baphomet, the mystic pantheos of thosedisciples of ceremonial magic, the Templars, who probably obtained it from theArabians. Fully convinced that their Scriptures sanctioned it, numerous mediaevalQabbalists devoted their lives to the practice of ceremonial magic. Thetranscendentalism of the Qabbalists is founded upon the ancient and magical for-mula of King Solomon, who has long been considered by the Jews as the prince ofceremonial magicians.Among the Qabbalists of the Middle Ages were a great number of black magicianswho strayed from the noble concepts of the Sepher Yetzirah and became enmeshedin demonism and witchcraft. They sought to substitute magic mirrors, consecrateddaggers, and circles spread around posts of coffin nails, for the living of thatvirtuous life which, without the assistance of complicated rituals or submundanecreatures, unfailingly brings man to the state of true individual completion.Those who sought to control elemental spirits through ceremonial magic did solargely with the hope of securing from the invisible worlds either rareknowledge or supernatural power. The little red demon of Napoleon Bonaparte andthe infamous oracular heads of de Medici are examples of the disastrous resultsof permitting elemental beings to dictate the course of human procedure. Whilethe learned and godlike daemon of Socrates seems to have been an exception, thisreally proves that the intellectual and moral status of the magician has much todo with the type of elemental he is capable of invoking. But even the daemon ofSocrates deserted the philosopher when the sentence of death was passed.Transcendentalism and all forms of phenomenalistic magic are but blindalleys—outgrowths of Atlantean sorcery; and those who forsake the straight pathof philosophy to wander therein almost invariably fall victims to theirimprudence. Man, incapable of controlling his own appetites, is not equal to thetask of governing the fiery and tempestuous elemental spirits.Many a magician has lost his life as the result of opening a way wherebysubmundane creatures could become active participants in his affairs. WhenEliphas Levi invoked the spirit of Apollonius of Tyana, what did he hope toaccomplish? Is the gratification of curiosity a motive sufficient to warrant thedevotion of an entire lifetime to a dangerous and unprofitable pursuit? If theliving Apollonius refused to divulge his secrets to the profane, is there anyprobability that after death he would disclose them to the curious-minded? Levihimself did not dare to assert that the specter which appeared to him wasactually the great philosopher, for Levi realized only too well the proclivityof elementals to impersonate those who have passed on. The majority of modernmediumistic apparitions are but elemental creatures masquerading through bodiescomposed of thought substance supplied by the very persons desiring to beholdthese wraiths of decarnate beings."},{"pageContent":"THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF BLACK MAGIC Some understanding of the intricate theory and practice of ceremonial magic maybe derived from a brief consideration of its underlying premises.First. The visible universe has an invisible counterpart, the higher planes ofwhich are peopled by good and beautiful spirits; the lower planes, dark andforeboding, are the habitation of evil spirits and demons under the leadershipof the Fallen Angel and his ten Princes.Second. By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible tocontact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking.Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to any worthy enterprise, but theevil spirits serve only those who live to pervert and destroy.Third. It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magicianbecomes for a stipulated time the master of an elemental being.Fourth. True black magic is performed with the aid of a demoniacal spirit, whoserves the sorcerer for the length of his earthly life, with the understandingthat after death the magician shall become the servant of his own demon. Forthis reason a black magician will go to inconceivable ends to prolong hisphysical life, since there is nothing for him beyond the grave.The most dangerous form of black magic is the scientific perversion of occultpower for the gratification of personal desire. Its less complex and moreuniversal form is human selfishness, for selfishness is the fundamental cause ofall worldly evil. A man will barter his eternal soul for temporal power, anddown through the ages a mysterious process has been evolved which actuallyenables him to make this exchange. In its various branches the black artincludes nearly all forms of ceremonial magic, necromancy, witchcraft, sorcery,and vampirism. Under the same general heading are also included mesmerism andhypnotism, except when used solely for medical purposes, and even then there isan element of risk for all concerned.Though the demonism of the Middle Ages seems to have disappeared, there isabundant evidence that in many forms of modern thought—especially the so-called“prosperity” psychology, “will-power-building” metaphysics, and systems of“high-pressure” salesmanship—black magic has merely passed through ametamorphosis, and although its name be changed its nature remains the same.A well-known magician of the Middle Ages was Dr. Johannes Faustus, more commonlyknown as Dr. Faust. By a study of magical writings he was enabled to bind to hisservice an elemental who served him for many years in various capacities.Strange legends are told concerning the magical powers possessed by Dr. Faust.Upon one occasion the philosopher, being apparently in a playful mood, threw hismantle over a number of eggs in a market-woman’s basket, causing them to hatchinstantly At another time, having fallen overboard from a small boat, he waspicked up and returned to the craft with his clothes still dry. But, like nearlyall other magicians, Dr. Faust came at length to disaster; he was found onemorning with a knife in his back, and it was commonly believed that his familiarspirit had murdered him. Although Goethe’s Dr. Faust is generally regarded asmerely a fictional character, this old magician actually lived during thesixteenth century. Dr. Faust wrote a book describing his experiences withspirits, a section of which is reprinted below. (Dr. Faust must not be confusedwith Johann Fust, the printer.)"},{"pageContent":"EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF DR. FAUST, WITTENBERG, 1524 (An abridged translation from the original German of a book ordered destroyed.)“From my youth I followed art and science and was tireless in my reading ofbooks. Among those which came to my hand was a volume containing all kinds ofinvocations and magical formulae. In this book I discovered information to theeffect that a spirit, whether he be of the fire, the water, the earth or theair, can be compelled to do the will of a magician capable of controlling him. Ialso discovered that according as one spirit has more power than another, eachis adapted for a different operation and each is capable of producing certainsupernatural effects.“After reading this wonderful book, I made several experiments, desiring to testthe accuracy of the statements made therein. At first I had little faith thatwhat was promised would take place. But at the very first invocation which Iattempted a mighty spirit manifested to me, desiring to know why I had invokedhim. His coming so amazed me that I scarcely knew what to say, but finally askedhim if he would serve me in my magical investigations. He replied that ifcertain conditions were agreed upon he would. The conditions were that I shouldmake a pact with him. This I did not desire to do, but as in my ignorance I hadnot protected myself with a circle and was actually at the mercy of the spirit,I did not dare to refuse his request and resigned myself to the inevitable,considering it wisest to turn my mantle according to the wind.“I then told him that if he would be serviceable to me according to my desiresand needs for a certain length of time, I would sign myself over to him. Afterthe pact had been arranged, this mighty spirit, whose name was Asteroth,introduced me to another spirit by the name of Marbuel, who was appointed to bemy servant. I questioned Marbuel as to his suitability for my needs. I asked himhow quick he was, and he answered, ‘As swift as the winds.’ This did not satisfyme, so I replied, ‘You cannot become my servant. Go again whence you have come.’Soon another spirit manifested itself, whose name was Aniguel. Upon asking himthe same question he answered that he was swift as a bird in the air, I said,‘You are still too slow for me. Go whence you came.’ In the same moment anotherspirit by the name of Aciel manifested himself. For the third time I asked myquestion and he answered, ‘I am as swift as human thought.’ ‘You shall serveme,’ I replied. This spirit was faithful for a long time, but to tell you how heserved me is not possible in a document of this length and I will here onlyindicate how spirits are to be invoked and how the circles for protection are tobe prepared. There are many kinds of spirits which will permit themselves to beinvoked by man and become his servant. Of these I will list a few:088 [images/00089.jpg] A MAGIC CIRCLE.The above figure is a complete and faithful representation of a magic circle asdesigned by mediæval conjurers for the invocation of spirits. The magicianaccompanied by his assistant takes his place at the point formed by the crossingof the central lines marked MAGISTER. The words about the circle are the namesof the invisible intelligences, and the small crosses mark points at whichcertain prayers and invocations are recited. The small circle outside isprepared for the spirit to be invoked, and while in use has the signature of thedesired intelligence traced within the triangle. “Aciel: The mightiest among those who serve men. He manifests in pleasing humanform about three feet high. He must be invoked three times before he will comeforth into the circle prepared for him. He will furnish riches and willinstantly fetch things from a great distance, according to the will of themagician. He is as swift as human thought.“Aniguel: Serviceable and most useful, and comes in the form of a ten-year-oldboy. He must be invoked three times. His special power is to discover treasuresand minerals hidden in the ground, which he will furnish to the magician.“Marbuel: A true lord of the mountains and swift as a bird on the wing. He is anopposing and troublesome spirit, hard to control. You must invoke him fourtimes. He appears in the person of Mars [a warrior in heavy armor]. He willfurnish the magician those things which grow above and under the earth. He isparticularly the lord of the spring-root. [The spring-root is a mysterious herb,possibly of a reddish color, which mediaeval magicians asserted had the propertyof drawing forth or opening anything it touched. If placed against a lockeddoor, it would open the door. The Hermetists believed that the red-cappedwoodpecker was specially endowed with the faculty of discovering spring-root, sothey followed this bird to its nest, and then stopped up the hole in the treewhere its young were. The red-crested woodpecker went at once in quest of thespring-root, and, discovering it, brought it to the tree. It immediately drewforth the stopper from the entrance to the nest. The magician then secured theroot from the bird. It was also asserted that because of its structure, theetheric body of the spring-root was utilized as a vehicle of expression bycertain elemental spirits which manifested through the proclivity of drawing outor opening things.]“Aciebel: A mighty ruler of the sea, controlling things both upon and under thewater. He furnishes things lost or sunk in rivers, lakes, and oceans, such assunken ships and treasures. The more sharply you invoke him, the swifter he isupon his errands.“Machiel: Comes in the form of a beautiful maiden and by her aid the magician israised to honor and dignity. She makes those she serves worthy and noble,gracious and kindly, and assists in all matters of litigation and justice. Shewill not come unless invoked twice.“Baruel: The master of all arts. He manifests as a master workman and comeswearing an apron. He can teach a magician more in a moment than all the masterworkmen of the world combined could accomplish in twenty years. He must beinvoked three times.“These are the spirits most serviceable to man, but there are numerous otherswhich, for lack of space, I am unable to describe. Now, if you desire the aid ofthe spirit to get this or that, then you must first draw the sign of the spiritwhom you desire to invoke. The drawing must be made just in front of a circlemade before sunrise, in which you and your assistants will stand. If you desirefinancial assistance, then you must invoke the spirit Aciel. Draw his sign infront of the circle. If you need other things, then draw the sign of the spiritcapable of furnishing them. On the place where you intend to make the circle,you must first draw a great cross with a large sword with which no one ever hasbeen hurt. Then you must make three concentric circles. The innermost circle ismade of a long narrow strip of virgin parchment and must be hung upon twelvecrosses made of the wood of cross-thorn. Upon the parchment you must write thenames and symbols according to the figure which follows. Outside this firstcircle make the second as follows:“First secure a thread of red silk that has been spun or twisted to the leftinstead of the right. Then place in the ground twelve crosses made of laurelleaves, and also prepare a long strip of new white paper. Write with an unusedpen the characters and symbols as seen on the second circle. Wind this latterstrip of paper around with the red silken thread and pin them upon the twelvecrosses of laurel leaves. Outside this second circle make a third one which isalso of virgin parchment and pinned upon twelve crosses of consecrated palm.When you have made these three circles, retire into them until at last you standin the center upon a pentagram drawn in the midst of the great cross firstdrawn. Now, to insure success, do everything according to the description, andwhen you have read off the sacred invocation pronounce the name of the spiritwhich you desire to appear. It is essential that you pronounce the name verydistinctly. You must also note the day and the hour, for each spirit can only beinvoked at certain times.”While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elementaldemon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitelythe powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many yearselapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. Aworld of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness loomsnearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething maelstrom,expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid todie—because he will become the servant of his own demon—the magician commitscrime after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence. Realizing that lifeis maintained by the aid of a mysterious universal life force which is thecommon property of all creatures, the black magician often becomes an occultvampire, stealing this energy from others. According to mediaeval superstition,black magicians turned themselves into werewolves and roamed the earth at night,attacking defenseless victims for the life force contained in their blood."},{"pageContent":"MODUS OPERANDI FOR THE INVOCATION OF SPIRITS The following condensed extract from an ancient manuscript is reproducedherewith as representative of the ritualism of ceremonial magic.

But should the operation be performed in a retired part ofa house, et cetera, the circle may remain, as it might serve in a like futureoperation, but the room or building must be locked up to avoid the intrusion ofstrangers.”The agreement set forth above is purely ceremonial magic. In the case of blackmagic, it is the magician and not the demon who must sign the pact. When theblack magician binds an elemental to his service, a battle of wits ensues, whichthe demon eventually wins. With his own blood the magician signs the pactbetween himself and the demon, for in the arcanum of magic it is declared that“he controls the soul who controls the blood of another.” As long as themagician does not fail, the elemental will fulfil to the letter his obligationunder the pact, but the demon will try in every possible way to prevent themagician from carrying out his part of the contract. When the conjurer,ensconced within his circle, has evoked the spirit he desires to control and hasmade known his intention, the spirit will answer somewhat as follows: “I cannotaccede to your request nor fulfil it, unless after fifty years, you giveyourself to me, body and soul, to do with as I may please.”If the magician refuses, other terms will be discussed. The spirit may say: “Iwill remain in your service as long as on every Friday morning you will go forthupon the public street giving alms in the name of Lucifer. The first time youfail in this you belong to me.”If the magician still refuses, realizing that the demon will make it impossiblefor him to fulfil his contract, other terms will be discussed, until at last apact is agreed upon. It may read as follows: “I hereby promise the Great SpiritLucifuge, Prince of Demons, that each year I will bring unto him a human soul todo with as it may please him, and in return Lucifuge promises to bestow upon methe treasures of the earth and fulfil my every desire for the length of mynatural life. If I fail to bring him each year the offering specified above,then my own soul shall be forfeit to him. Signed ............” [Invocant signspact with his own blood.]"},{"pageContent":"THE PENTAGRAM In symbolism, an inverted figure always signifies a perverted power. The averageperson does not even suspect the occult properties of emblematic pentacles. Onthis subject the great Paracelsus has written: “No doubt many will scoff at theseals, their characters and their uses, which are described in these books,because it seems incredible to them that metals and characters which are deadshould have any effect. Yet no one has ever proved that the metals and also thecharacters as we know them are dead, for the salts, sulphur, and quintessencesof metals are the highest preservatives of human life and are far superior toall other simples.” (Translated from the original German.)The black magician cannot use the symbols of white magic without bringing downupon himself the forces of white magic, which would be fatal to his schemes. Hemust therefore distort the hierograms so that they typify the occult fact thathe himself is distorting the principles for which the symbols stand. Black magicis not a fundamental art; it is the misuse of an art. Therefore it has nosymbols of its own. It merely takes the emblematic figures of white magic, andby inverting and reversing them signifies that it is left-handed.A good instance of this practice is found in the pentagram or five-pointed star,made of five connected lines. This figure is the time-honored symbol of themagical arts, and signifies the five properties of the Great Magical Agent, thefive senses of man, the five elements of nature, the five extremities of thehuman body By means of the pentagram within his own soul, man not only maymaster and govern all creatures inferior to himself, but may demandconsideration at the hands of those superior to himself.The pentagram is used extensively in black magic, but when so used its formalways differs in one of three ways: The star may be broken at one point by notpermitting the converging lines to touch; it may be inverted by having one pointdown and two up; or it may be distorted by having the points of varying lengths.When used in black magic, the pentagram is called the “sign of the cloven hoof,”or the footprint of the Devil. The star with two points upward is also calledthe “Goat of Mendes,” because the inverted star is the same shape as a goat’shead. When the upright star turns and the upper point falls to the bottom, itsignifies the fall of the Morning Star."},{"pageContent":"XXIII The Elements and Their inhabitants For the most comprehensive and lucid exposition of occult pneumatology (thebranch of philosophy dealing with spiritual substances) extant, mankind isindebted to Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus vonHohenheim), prince of alchemists and Hermetic philosophers and true possessor ofthe Royal Secret (the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life). Paracelsusbelieved that each of the four primary elements known to the ancients (earth,fire, air, and water) consisted of a subtle, vaporous principle and a grosscorporeal substance.Air is, therefore, twofold in nature—tangible atmosphere and an intangible,volatile substratum which may be termed spiritual air. Fire is visible andinvisible, discernible and indiscernible—a spiritual, ethereal flame manifestingthrough a material, substantial flame. Carrying the analogy further, waterconsists of a dense fluid and a potential essence of a fluidic nature. Earth haslikewise two essential parts—the lower being fixed, terreous, immobile; thehigher, rarefied, mobile, and virtual. The general term elements has beenapplied to the lower, or physical, phases of these four primary principles, andthe name elemental essences to their corresponding invisible, spiritualconstitutions. Minerals, plants, animals, and men live in a world composed ofthe gross side of these four elements, and from various combinations of themconstruct their living organisms.Henry Drummond, in Natural Law in the Spiritual World, describes this process asfollows: “If we analyse this material point at which all life starts, we shallfind it to consist of a clear structureless, jelly-like substance resemblingalbumen or white of egg. It is made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen.Its name is protoplasm. And it is not only the structural unit with which allliving bodies start in life, but with which they are subsequently built up.‘Protoplasm,’ says Huxley, ‘simple or nucleated, is the formal basis of alllife. It is the clay of the Potter.”’The water element of the ancient philosophers has been metamorphosed into thehydrogen of modern science; the air has become oxygen; the fire, nitrogen; theearth, carbon.090 [images/00091.jpg] A SALAMANDER, ACCORDING TO PARACELSUS.The Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Persians often mistook the salamanders for gods,because of their radiant splendor and great power. The Greeks, following theexample of earlier nations, deified the fire spirits and in their honor keptincense and altar fires burning perpetually. Just as visible Nature is populated by an infinite number of living creatures,so, according to Paracelsus, the invisible, spiritual counterpart of visibleNature (composed of the tenuous principles of the visible elements) is inhabitedby a host of peculiar beings, to whom he has given the name elementals, andwhich have later been termed the Nature spirits. Paracelsus divided these peopleof the elements into four distinct groups, which he called gnomes, undines,sylphs, and salamanders. He taught that they were really living entities, manyresembling human beings in shape, and inhabiting worlds of their own, unknown toman because his undeveloped senses were incapable of functioning beyond thelimitations of the grosser elements.The civilizations of Greece, Rome, Egypt, China, and India believed implicitlyin satyrs, sprites, and goblins. They peopled the sea with mermaids, the riversand fountains with nymphs, the air with fairies, the fire with Lares andPenates, and the earth with fauns, dryads, and hamadryads. These Nature spiritswere held in the highest esteem, and propitiatory offerings were made to them.Occasionally, as the result of atmospheric conditions or the peculiarsensitiveness of the devotee, they became visible. Many authors wrote concerningthem in terms which signify that they had actually beheld these inhabitants ofNature’s finer realms. A number of authorities are of the opinion that many ofthe gods worshiped by the pagans were elementals, for some of these invisibleswere believed to be of commanding stature and magnificent deportment.The Greeks gave the name dœmon to some of these elementals, especially those ofthe higher orders, and worshiped them. Probably the most famous of these dœmonsis the mysterious spirit which instructed Socrates, and of whom that greatphilosopher spoke in the highest terms. Those who have devoted much study to theinvisible constitution of man realize that it is quite probable the daemon ofSocrates and the angel of Jakob Böhme were in reality not elementals, but theovershadowing divine natures of these philosophers themselves. In his notes toApuleius on the God of Socrates, Thomas Taylor says:“As the daemon of Socrates, therefore, was doubtless one of the highest order,as may be inferred from the intellectual superiority of Socrates to most othermen, Apuleius is justified in calling this dæmon a God. And that the daemon ofSocrates indeed was divine, is evident from the testimony of Socrates himself inthe First Alcibiades: for in the course of that dialogue he clearly says,‘I havelong been of the opinion that the God did not as yet direct me to hold anyconversation with you.’ And in the Apology he most unequivocally evinces thatthis daemon is allotted a divine transcendency, considered as ranking in theorder of dæmons.”The idea once held, that the invisible elements surrounding and interpenetratingthe earth were peopled with living, intelligent beings, may seem ridiculous tothe prosaic mind of today This doctrine, however, has found favor with some ofthe greatest intellects of the world. The sylphs of Facius Cardan, thephilosopher of Milan; the salamander seen by Benvenuto Cellini; the pan of St.Anthony; and Le petit homme rouge (the little red man, or gnome) of NapoleonBonaparte, have found their places in the pages of history.Literature has also perpetuated the concept of Nature spirits. The mischievousPuck of Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream; the elementals of AlexanderPope’s Rosicrucian poem, The Rape of the Lock; the mysterious creatures of LordLytton’s Zanoni; James Barrie’s immortal Tinker Bell; and the famous bowlersthat Rip Van Winkle encountered in the Catskill Mountains, are well-knowncharacters to students of literature. The folklore and mythology of all peoplesabound in legends concerning these mysterious little figures who haunt oldcastles, guard treasures in the depths of the earth, and build their homes underthe spreading protection of toadstools. Fairies are the delight of childhood,and most children give them up with reluctance. Not so very long ago thegreatest minds of the world believed in the existence of fairies, and it isstill an open question as to whether Plato, Socrates, and Iamblichus were wrongwhen they avowed their reality.Paracelsus, when describing the substances which constitute the bodies of theelementals, divided flesh into two kinds, the first being that which we have allinherited through Adam. This is the visible, corporeal flesh. The second wasthat flesh which had not descended from Adam and, being more attenuated, was notsubject to the limitations of the former. The bodies of the elementals werecomposed of this transubstantial flesh. Paracelsus stated that there is as muchdifference between the bodies of men and the bodies of the Nature spirits asthere is between matter and spirit.“Yet,” he adds, “the Elementals are not spirits, because they have flesh, bloodand bones; they live and propagate offspring; they eat and talk, act and sleep,&c., and consequently they cannot be properly called ‘spirits’ They are beingsoccupying a place between men and spirits, resembling men and spirits,resembling men and women in their organization and form, and resembling spiritsin the rapidity of their locomotion.” (Philosophia Occulta, translated by FranzHartmann.) Later the same author calls these creatures composita, inasmuch asthe substance out of which they are composed seems to be a composite of spiritand matter. He uses color to explain the idea. Thus, the mixture of blue and redgives purple, a new color, resembling neither of the others yet composed ofboth. Such is the case with the Nature spirits; they resemble neither spiritualcreatures nor material beings, yet are composed of the substance which we maycall spiritual matter, or ether.Paracelsus further adds that whereas man is composed of several natures (spirit,soul, mind, and body) combined in one unit, the elemental has but one principle,the ether out of which it is composed and in which it lives. The reader mustremember that by ether is meant the spiritual essence of one of the fourelements. There are as many ethers as there are elements and as many distinctfamilies of Nature spirits as there are ethers. These families are completelyisolated in their own ether and have no intercourse with the denizens of theother ethers; but, as man has within his own nature centers of consciousnesssensitive to the impulses of all the four ethers, it is possible for any of theelemental kingdoms to communicate with him under proper conditions.The Nature spirits cannot be destroyed by the grosser elements, such as materialfire, earth, air, or water, for they function in a rate of vibration higher thanthat of earthy substances. Being composed of only one element or principle (theether in which they function), they have no immortal spirit and at death merelydisintegrate back into the element from which they were originallyindividualized. No individual consciousness is preserved after death, for thereis no superior vehicle present to contain it. Being made of but one substance,there is no friction between vehicles: thus there is little wear or tearincurred by their bodily functions, and they therefore live to great age. Thosecomposed of earth ether are the shortest lived; those composed of air ether, thelongest. The average length of life is between three hundred and a thousandyears. Paracelsus maintained that they live in conditions similar to our earthenvironments, and are somewhat subject to disease. These creatures are thoughtto be incapable of ,spiritual development, but most of them are of a high moralcharacter.Concerning the elemental ethers in which the Nature spirits exist, Paracelsuswrote: “They live in the four elements: the Nymphæ in the element of water, theSylphes in that of the air, the Pigmies in the earth, and the Salamanders infire. They are also called Undinæ, Sylvestres, Gnomi, Vulcani, &c. Each speciesmoves only in the element to which it belongs, and neither of them can go out ofits appropriate element, which is to them as the air is to us, or the water tofishes; and none of them can live in the element belonging to another class. Toeach elemental being the element in which it lives is transparent, invisible andres- pirable, as the atmosphere is to ourselves.” (Philosophia Occulta,translated by Franz Hartmann.)The reader should be careful not to confuse the Nature spirits with the truelife waves evolving through the invisible worlds. While the elementals arecomposed of only one etheric (or atomic) essence, the angels, archangels, andother superior, transcendental entities have composite organisms, consisting ofa spiritual nature and a chain of vehicles to express that nature not unlikethose of men, but not including the physical body with its attendantlimitations.To the philosophy of Nature spirits is generally attributed an Eastern origin,probably Brahmanic; and Paracelsus secured his knowledge of them from Orientalsages with whom he came in contact during his lifetime of philosophicalwanderings. The Egyptians and Greeks gleaned their information from the samesource. The four main divisions of Nature spirits must now be consideredseparately, according to the teachings of Paracelsus and the Abbé de Villars andsuch scanty writings of other authors as are available."},{"pageContent":"THE GNOMES The elementals who dwell in that attenuated body of the earth which is calledthe terrreous ether are grouped together under the general heading of gnomes.(The name is probably derived from the Greek genomus, meaning earth dweller. SeeNew English Dictionary. )Just as there are many types of human beings evolving through the objectivephysical elements of Nature, so there are many types of gnomes evolving throughthe subjective ethereal body of Nature. These earth spirits work in an elementso close in vibratory rate to the material earth that they have immense powerover its rocks and flora, and also over the mineral elements in the animal andhuman kingdoms. Some, like the pygmies, work with the stones, gems, and metals,and are supposed to be the guardians of hidden treasures. They live in caves,far down in what the Scandinavians called the Land of the Nibelungen. InWagner’s wonderful opera cycle, The Ring of the Nibelungen, Alberich makeshimself King of the Pygmies and forces these little creatures to gather for himthe treasures concealed beneath the surface of the earth.Besides the pygmies there are other gnomes, who are called tree and forestsprites. To this group belong the sylvestres, satyrs, pans, dyrads, hamadryads,durdalis, elves, brownies, and little old men of the woods. Paracelsus statesthat the gnomes build houses of substances resembling in their constituenciesalabaster, marble, and cement, but the true nature of these materials isunknown, having no counterpart in physical nature. Some families of gnomesgather in communities, while others are indigenous to the substances with and inwhich they work. For example, the hamadryads live and die with the plants ortrees of which they are a part. Every shrub and flower is said to have its ownNature spirit, which often uses the physical body of the plant as itshabitation. The ancient philosophers, recognizing the principle ofintelligencemanifesting itself in every department of Nature alike, believed that thequality of natural selection exhibited by creatures not possessing organizedmentalities expressed in reality the decisions of the Nature spirits themselves.091 [images/00092.jpg] CONVENTIONAL GNOMES.The type of gnome most frequently seen is the brownie, or elf, a mischievous andgrotesque little creature from twelve to eighteen inches high, usually dressedin green or russet brown. Most of them appear as very aged, often with longwhite beards, and their figures are inclined to rotundity. They can be seenscampering out of holes in the stumps of trees and sometimes they vanish byactuary dissolving into the tree itself. C. M. Gayley, in The Classic Myths, says: “It was a pleasing trait in the oldpaganism that it loved to trace in every operation of nature the agency ofdeity. The imagination of the Greeks peopled the regions of earth and sea withdivinities, to whose agency it attributed the phenomena that our philosophyascribes to the operation of natural law.” Thus, in behalf of the plant itworked with, the elemental accepted and rejected food elements, depositedcoloring matter therein, preserved and protected the seed, and performed manyother beneficent offices. Each species was served by a different but appropriatetype of Nature spirit. Those working with poisonous shrubs, for example, wereoffensive in their appearance. It is said the Nature spirits of poison hemlockresemble closely tiny human skeletons, thinly covered with a semi-transparentflesh. They live in and through the hemlock, and if it be cut down remain withthe broken shoots until both die, but while there is the slightest evidence oflife in the shrub it shows the presence of the elemental guardian.Great trees also have their Nature spirits, but these are much larger than theelementals of smaller plants. The labors of the pygmies include the cutting ofthe crystals in the rocks and the development of veins of ore. When the gnomesare laboring with animals or human beings, their work is confined to the tissuescorresponding with their own natures. Hence they work with the bones, whichbelong to the mineral kingdom, and the ancients believed the reconstruction ofbroken members to be impossible without the cooperation of the elementals.The gnomes are of various sizes—most of them much smaller than human beings,though some of them have the power of changing their stature at will. This isthe result of the extreme mobility of the element in which they function.Concerning them Abbé de Villars wrote: “The earth is filled well nigh to itscenter with Gnomes, people of slight stature, who are the guardians oftreasures, minerals and precious stones. They are ingenious, friends of man, andeasy to govern.”Not all authorities agree concerning the amiable disposition of the gnomes. Manystate that they are of a tricky and malicious nature, difficult to manage, andtreacherous. Writers agree, however, that when their confidence is won they arefaithful and true. The philosophers and initiates of the ancient world wereinstructed concerning these mysterious little people and were taught how tocommunicate with them and gain their cooperation in undertakings of importance.The magi were always warned, however, never to betray the trust of theelementals, for if they did, the invisible creatures, working through thesubjective nature of man, could cause them endless sorrow and probably ultimatedestruction. So long as the mystic served others, the gnomes would save him, butif he sought to use their aid selfishly to gain temporal power they would turnupon him with unrelenting fury. The same was true if he sought to deceive them.The earth spirits meet at certain times of the year in great conclaves, asShakespeare suggests in his Midsummer Night’s Dream, where the elementals allgather to rejoice in the beauty and harmony of Nature and the prospects of anexcellent harvest. The gnomes are ruled over by a king, whom they greatly loveand revere. His name is Gob; hence his subjects are often called goblins.Mediaeval mystics gave a corner of creation (one of the cardinal points) to eachof the four kingdoms of Nature spirits, and because of their earthy characterthe gnomes were assigned to the North—the place recognized by the ancients asthe source of darkness and death. One of the four main divisions of humandisposition was also assigned to the gnomes, and because so many of them dweltin the darkness of caves and the gloom of forests their temperament was said tobe melancholy, gloomy and despondent. By that it is not meant that theythemselves are of such disposition, but rather that they have special controlover elements of similar consistency.The gnomes marry and have families, and the female gnomes are called gno- mides.Some wear clothing woven of the element in which they live. In other instancestheir garments are part of themselves and grow with them, like the fur ofanimals. The gnomes are said to have insatiable appetites, and to spend a greatpart of the time eating, but they earn their food by diligent and conscientiouslabor. Most of them are of a miserly temperament, fond of storing things away insecret places. There is abundant evidence of the fact that small children oftensee the gnomes, inasmuch as their contact with the material side of Nature isnot yet complete and they still function more or less consciously in theinvisible worlds.According to Paracelsus, “Man lives in the exterior elements and the Elementalslive in the interior elements. The latter have dwellings and clothing, mannersand customs, languages and governments of their own, in the same sense as thebees have their queens and herds of animals their leaders.” (PhilosophiaOcculta, translated by Franz Hartmann.)Paracelsus differs somewhat from the Greek mystics concerning the environmentallimitations imposed on the Nature spirits. The Swiss philosopher constitutesthem of subtle invisible ethers. According to this hypothesis they would bevisible only at certain times and only to those en rapport with their etherealvibrations. The Greeks, on the other hand, apparently believed that many Naturespirits had material constitutions capable of functioning in the physical world.Often the recollection of a dream is so vivid that, upon awakening, a personactually believes that he has passed through a physical experience. Thedifficulty of accurately judging as to the end of physical sight and thebeginning of ethereal vision may account for these differences of opinion.Even this explanation, however, does not satisfactorily account for the satyrwhich, according to St. Jerome, was captured alive during the reign ofConstantine and exhibited to the people. It was of human form with the horns andfeet of a goat. After its death it was preserved in salt and taken to theEmperor that he might testify to its reality. (It is within the bounds ofprobability that this curiosity was what modern science knows as monstrosity. )"},{"pageContent":"THE UNDINES As the gnomes were limited in their function to the elements of the earth, sothe undines (a name given to the family of water elementals) function in theinvisible, spiritual essence called humid (or liquid) ether. In its vibratoryrate this is close to the element water, and so the undines are able to control,to a great degree, the course and function of this fluid in Nature. Beauty seemsto be the keynote of the water spirits. Wherever we find them pictured in art orsculpture, they abound in symmetry and grace. Controlling the waterelement—which has always been a feminine symbol—it is natural that the waterspirits should most often be symbolized as female.092 [images/00093.jpg] A MERMAID.Probably the most famous of the undines were the mythological mermaids, withwhich early mariners peopled the Seven Seas. Belief in the existence of thesecreatures, the upper half of their bodies human in form and the lower halffishlike, may have been inspired by fiocks of penguins seen at a great distance,or possibly seals. In mediæval descriptions of the mermaids, it was also statedthat their hair was green like seaweed and that they wore wreaths twisted fromthe blossoms of subaqueous plants and sea anemones. There are many groups of undines. Some inhabit waterfalls, where they can beseen in the spray; others are indigenous to swiftly moving rivers; some havetheir habitat in dripping, oozing fens or marshes; while other groups dwell inclear mountain lakes. According to the philosophers of antiquity, every fountainhad its nymph; every ocean wave its oceanid. The water spirits were known undersuch names as oreades, nereides, limoniades, naiades, water sprites, sea maids,mermaids, and potamides. Often the water nymphs derived their names from thestreams, lakes, or seas in which they dwelt.In describing them, the ancients agreed on certain salient features. In general,nearly all the undines closely resembled human beings in appearance and size,though the ones inhabiting small streams and fountains were of correspondinglylesser proportions. It was believed that these water spirits were occasionallycapable of assuming the appearance of normal human beings and actuallyassociating with men and women. There are many legends about these spirits andtheir adoption by the families of fishermen, but in nearly every case theundines heard the call of the waters and returned to the realm of Neptune, theKing of the Sea.Practically nothing is known concerning the male undines. The water spirits didnot establish homes in the same way that the gnomes did, but lived in coralcaves under the ocean or among the reeds growing on the banks of rivers or theshores of lakes. Among the Celts there is a legend to the effect that Irelandwas peopled, before the coming of its present inhabitants, by a strange race ofsemidivine creatures; with the coming of the modern Celts they retired into themarshes and fens, where they remain even to this day. Diminutive undines livedunder lily pads and in little houses of moss sprayed by waterfalls. The undinesworked with the vital essences and liquids in plants, animals, and human beings,and were present in everything containing water. When seen, the undinesgenerally resembled the goddess of Greek statuary. They rose from the waterdraped in mist and could not exist very long apart from it.There are many families of undines, each with its peculiar limitations. It isimpossible to consider them here in detail. Their ruler, Necksa, they love andhonor, and serve untiringly. Their temperament is said to be vital, and to themhas been given as their throne the western corner of creation. They are ratheremotional beings, friendly to human life and fond of serving mankind. They aresometimes pictured riding on dolphins or other great fish and seem to have aspecial love of flowers and plants, which they serve almost as devotedly andintelligently as the gnomes. Ancient poets have said that the songs of theundines were heard in the West Wind and that their lives were consecrated to thebeautifying of the material earth."},{"pageContent":"THE SALAMANDERS The third group of elementals is the salamanders, or spirits of fire, who livein that attenuated, spiritual ether which is the invisible fire element ofNature. Without them material fire cannot exist; a match cannot be struck norwill flint and steel give off their spark without the assistance of asalamander, who immediately appears (so the mediaeval mystics believed), evokedby friction. Man is unable to communicate successfully with the salamanders,owing to the fiery element in which they dwell, for everything is resolved toashes that comes into their presence. By specially prepared compounds of herbsand perfumes the philosophers of the ancient world manufactured many kinds ofincense. When incense was burned, the vapors which arose were especiallysuitable as a medium for the expression of these elementals, who, by borrowingthe ethereal effluvium from the incense smoke, were able to make their presencefelt.The salamanders are as varied in their grouping and arrangement as either theundines or the gnomes. There are many families of them, differing in appearance,size, and dignity. Sometimes the salamanders were visible as small balls oflight. Paracelsus says: “Salamanders have been seen in the shapes of fieryballs, or tongues of fire, running over the fields or peering in houses.”(Philosophia Occulta, translated by Franz Hartmann.)Mediaeval investigators of the Nature spirits were of the opinion that the mostcommon form of salamander was lizard-like in shape, a foot or more in length,and visible as a glowing Urodela, twisting and crawling in the midst of thefire. Another group was described as huge flaming giants in flowing robes,protected with sheets of fiery armor. Certain mediaeval authorities, among themthe Abbé de Villars, held that Zarathustra (Zoroaster) was the son of Vesta(believed to have been the wife of Noah) and the great salamander Oromasis.Hence, from that time onward, undying fires have been maintained upon thePersian altars in honor of Zarathustra’s flaming father.One most important subdivision of the salamanders was the Acthnici. Thesecreatures appeared only as indistinct globes. They were supposed to float overwater at night and occasionally to appear as forks of flame on the masts andrigging of ships (St. Elmo’s fire). The salamanders were the strongest and mostpowerful of the elementals, and had as their ruler a magnificent flaming spiritcalled Djin, terrible and awe-inspiring in appearance. The salamanders weredangerous and the sages were warned to keep away from them, as the benefitsderived from studying them were often not commensurate with the price paid. Asthe ancients associated heat with the South, this corner of creation wasassigned to the salamanders as their throne, and they exerted special influenceover all beings of fiery or tempestuous temperament. In both animals and men,the salamanders work through the emotional nature by means of the body heat, theliver, and the blood stream. Without their assistance there would be no warmth."},{"pageContent":"THE SYLPHS While the sages said that the fourth class of elementals, or sylphs, lived inthe element of air, they meant by this not the natural atmosphere of the earth,but the invisible, intangible, spiritual medium—an ethereal substance similar incomposition to our atmosphere, but far more subtle. In the last discourse ofSocrates, as preserved by Plato in his Phœdo, the condemned philosopher says:“And upon the earth are animals and men, some in a middle region, others[elementals] dwelling about the air as we dwell about the sea; others in islandswhich the air flows round, near the continent; and in a word, the air is used bythem as the water and the sea are by us, and the ether is to them what the airis to us. Moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such that they have nodisease [Paracelsus disputes this], and live much longer than we do, and havesight and hearing and smell, and all the other senses, in far greaterperfection, in the same degree that air is purer than water or the ether thanair. Also they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell,and they hear their voices and receive their answers, and are conscious of themand hold converse with them, and they see the sun, moon, and stars as theyreally are, and their other blessedness is of a piece with this.” While thesylphs were believed to live among the clouds and in the surrounding air, theirtrue home was upon the tops of mountains.In his editorial notes to the Occult Sciences of Salverte, Anthony Todd Thomsonsays: “The Fayes and Fairies are evidently of Scandinavian origin, although thename of Fairy is supposed to be derived from, or rather [is] a modification ofthe Persian Peri, an imaginary benevolent being, whose province it was to guardmen from the maledictions of evil spirits; but with more probability it may bereferred to the Gothic Fagur, as the term Elves is from Alfa, the generalappellation for the whole tribe. If this derivation of the name of Fairy beadmitted, we may date the commencement of the popular belief in British Fairiesto the period of the Danish conquest. They were supposed to be diminutive aerialbeings, beautiful, lively, and beneficent in their intercourse with mortals,inhabiting a region called Fairy Land, Alf-heinner; commonly appearing on earthat intervals—when they left traces of their visits, in beautiful green-rings,where the dewy sward had been trodden in their moonlight dances.”To the sylphs the ancients gave the labor of modeling the snowflakes andgathering clouds. This latter they accomplished with the cooperation of theundines who supplied the moisture. The winds were their particular vehicle andthe ancients referred to them as the spirits of the air. They are the highest ofall the elementals, their native element being the highest in vibratory rate.They live hundreds of years, often attaining to a thousand years and neverseeming to grow old. The leader of the sylphs is called Paralda, who is said todwell on the highest mountain of the earth. The female sylphs were calledsylphids.It is believed that the sylphs, salamanders, and nymphs had much to do with theoracles of the ancients; that in fact they were the ones who spoke from thedepths of the earth and from the air above.The sylphs sometimes assume human form, but apparently for only short periods oftime. Their size varies, but in the majority of cases they are no larger thanhuman beings and often considerably smaller. It is said that the sylphs haveaccepted human beings into their communities and have permitted them to livethere for a considerable period; in fact, Paracelsus wrote of such an incident,but of course it could not have occurred while the human stranger was in hisphysical body By some, the Muses of the Greeks are believed to have been sylphs,for these spirits are said to gather around the mind of the dreamer, the poet,and the artist, and inspire him with their intimate knowledge of the beautiesand workings of Nature. To the sylphs were given the eastern corner of creation.Their temperament is mirthful, changeable, and eccentric. The peculiar qualitiescommon to men of genius are supposedly the result of the cooperation of sylphs,whose aid also brings with it the sylphic inconsistency. The sylphs labor withthe gases of the human body and indirectly with the nervous system, where theirinconstancy is again apparent. They have no fixed domicile, but wander aboutfrom place to place—elemental nomads, invisible but ever-present powers in theintelligent activity of the universe."},{"pageContent":"GENERAL OBSERVATIONS Certain of the ancients, differing with Paracelsus, shared the opinion that theelemental kingdoms were capable of waging war upon one another, and theyrecognized in the battlings of the elements disagreements among these kingdomsof Nature spirits. When lightning struck a rock and splintered it, they believedthat the salamanders were attacking the gnomes. As they could not attack oneanother on the plane of their own peculiar etheric essences, owing to the factthat there was no vibratory correspondence between the four ethers of whichthese kingdoms are composed, they had to attack through a common denominator,namely, the material substance of the physical universe over which they had acertain amount of power.Wars were also fought within the groups themselves; one army of gnomes wouldattack another army, and civil war would be rife among them. Philosophers oflong ago solved the problems of Nature’s apparent inconsistencies byindividualizing and personifying all its forces, crediting them with havingtemperaments not unlike the human and then expecting them to exhibit typicalhuman inconsistencies. The four fixed signs of the zodiac were assigned to thefour kingdoms of elementals. The gnomes were said to be of the nature of Taurus;the undines, of the nature of Scorpio; the salamanders exemplified theconstitution of Leo; while the sylphs manipulated the emanations of Aquarius.The Christian Church gathered all the elemental entities together under thetitle of demon. This is a misnomer with far-reaching consequences, for to theaverage mind the word demon means an evil thing, and the Nature spirits areessentially no more malevolent than are the minerals, plants, and animals. Manyof the early Church Fathers asserted that they had met and debated with theelementals.As already stated, the Nature spirits are without hope of immortality, althoughsome philosophers have maintained that in isolated cases immortality wasconferred upon them by adepts and initiates who understood certain subtleprinciples of the invisible worlds. As disintegration takes place in thephysical world, so it takes place in the ethereal counterpart of physicalsubstance. Under normal conditions at death, a Nature spirit is merely resolvedback into the transparent primary essence from which it was originallyindividualized. Whatever evolutionary growth is made is recorded solely in theconsciousness of that primary essence, or element, and not in the temporarilyindividualized entity of the elemental. Being without man’s compound organismand lacking his spiritual and intellectual vehicles, the Nature spirits aresubhuman in their rational intelligence, but from their functions—limited to oneelement—has resulted a specialized type of intelligence far ahead of man inthose lines of research peculiar to the element in which they exist.The terms incubus and succubus have been applied indiscriminately by the ChurchFathers to elementals. The incubus and succubus, however, are evil and unnaturalcreations, whereas elementals is a collective term for all the inhabitants ofthe four elemental essences. According to Paracelsus, the incubus and succubus(which are male and female respectively) are parasitical creatures subsistingupon the evil thoughts and emotions of the astral body These terms are alsoapplied to the superphysical organisms of sorcerers and black magicians. Whilethese larvœ are in no sense imaginary beings, they are, nevertheless, theoffspring of the imagination. By the ancient sages they were recognized as theinvisible cause of vice because they hover in the ethers surrounding the morallyweak and continually incite them to excesses of a degrading nature. For thisreason they frequent the atmosphere of the dope den, the dive, and the brothel,where they attach themselves to those unfortunates who have given themselves upto iniquity By permitting his senses to become deadened through indulgence inhabit-forming drugs or alcoholic stimulants, the individual becomes temporarilyen rapport with these denizens of the astral plane. The houris seen by thehasheesh or opium addict and the lurid monsters which torment the victim ofdelirium tremens are examples of submundane beings, visible only to those whoseevil practices are the magnet for their attraction.Differing widely from the elementals and also the incubus and succubus is thevampire, which is defined by Paracelsus as the astral body of a person eitherliving or dead (usually the latter state). The vampire seeks to prolongexistence upon the physical plane by robbing the living of their vital energiesand misappropriating such energies to its own ends.In his De Ente Spirituali Paracelsus writes thus of these malignant beings: “Ahealthy and pure person cannot become obsessed by them, because such Larvae canonly act upon men if the latter make room for them in their minds. A healthymind is a castle that cannot be invaded without the will of its master; but ifthey are allowed to enter, they excite the passions of men and women, theycreate cravings in them, they produce bad thoughts which act injuriously uponthe brain; they sharpen the animal intellect and suffocate the moral sense. Evilspirits obsess only those human beings in whom the animal nature ispredominating. Minds that are illuminated by the spirit of truth cannot bepossessed; only those who are habitually guided by their own lower impulses maybecome subjected to their influences.” (See Paracelsus, by Franz Hartmann.)A strange concept, and one somewhat at variance with the conventional, is thatevolved by the Count de Gabalis concerning the immaculate conception, namely,that it represents the union of a human being with an elemental. Among theoffspring of such unions he lists Hercules, Achilles, Æneas, Theseus,Melchizedek, the divine Plato, Apollonius of Tyana, and Merlin the Magician."},{"pageContent":"XXIV Hermetic Pharmacology, Chemistry, and Therapeutics The art of healing was originally one of the secret sciences of the priestcraft,and the mystery of its source is obscured by the same veil which hides thegenesis of religious belief. All higher forms of knowledge were originally inthe possession of the sacerdotal castes. The temple was the cradle ofcivilization. The priests, exercising their divine prerogative, made the lawsand enforced them; appointed the rulers and controlled them; ministered to theneeds of the living, and guided the destinies of the dead. All branches oflearning were monopolized by the priesthood, who admitted into their ranks onlythose intellectually and morally qualified to perpetuate their arcanum. Thefollowing quotation from Plato’s Statesman is apropos of the subject: “* * * inEgypt, the King himself is not allowed to reign, unless he have priestly powers;and if he should be one of another class, and have obtained the throne byviolence, he must get enrolled in the priestcraft.”Candidates aspiring to membership in the religious orders underwent severe teststo prove their worthiness. These ordeals were called initiations. Those whopassed them successfully were welcomed as brothers by the priests and wereinstructed in the secret teachings. Among the ancients, philosophy, science, andreligion were never considered as separate units: each was regarded as anintegral part of the whole. Philosophy was scientific and religious; science wasphilosophic and religious; religion was philosophic and scientific. Perfectwisdom was considered unattainable save as the result of harmonizing all threeof these expressions of mental and moral activity.While modern physicians accredit Hippocrates with being the father of medicine,the ancient therapeutœ ascribed to the immortal Hermes the distinction of beingthe founder of the art of healing. Clemens Alexandrinus, in describing the bookspurported to be from the stylus of Hermes, divided the sacred writings into sixgeneral classifications, one of which, the Pastophorus, was devoted to thescience of medicine. The Smaragdine, or Emerald Tablet, found in the valley ofEbron and generally accredited to Hermes, is in reality a chemical formula of ahigh and secret order.Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician, during the fifth century before Christ,dissociated the healing art from the other sciences of the temple and therebyestablished a precedent for separateness. One of the consequences is the presentwidespread crass scientific materialism. The ancients realized theinterdependence of the sciences. The moderns do not; and as a result, incompletesystems of learning are attempting to maintain isolated individualism. Theobstacles which confront present-day scientific research are largely the resultof prejudicial limitations imposed by those who are unwilling to accept thatwhich transcends the concrete perceptions of the five primary human senses."},{"pageContent":"THE PARACELSIAN SYSTEM OF MEDICAL PHILOSOPHY During the Middle Ages the long-ignored axioms and formulae of Hermetic wisdomwere assembled once more, and chronicled, and systematic attempts were made totest their accuracy. To Theophrastus of Hohenheim, who called himself Paracelsus(a name meaning “greater than Celsus”), the world is indebted for much of theknowledge it now possesses of the ancient systems of medicine. Paracelsusdevoted his entire life to the study and exposition of Hermetic philosophy.Every notion and theory was grist to his mill, and, while members of the medicalfraternity belittle his memory now as they opposed his system then, the occultworld knows that he will yet be recognized as the greatest physician of alltimes. While the heterodox and exotic temperament of Paracelsus has been heldagainst him by his enemies, and his wanderlust has been called vaga- bondage, hewas one of the few minds who intelligently sought to reconcile the art ofhealing with the philosophic and religious systems of paganism and Christianity.In defending his right to seek knowledge in all parts of the earth, and amongall classes of society, Paracelsus wrote: “Therefore I consider that it is forme a matter of praise, not of blame, that I have hitherto and worthily pursuedmy wanderings. For this will I bear witness respecting nature: he who willinvestigate her ways must travel her books with his feet. That which is writtenis investigated not through its letters, but nature from land to land—as often aland so often a leaf. Thus is the Codex of Nature, thus must its leaves beturned.” (Paracelsus, by John Maxson Stillman.)Paracelsus was a great observationalist, and those who knew him best have calledhim “The Second Hermes” and “The Trismegistus of Switzerland.” He traveledEurope from end to end, and may have penetrated Eastern lands while running downsuperstitions and ferreting out supposedly lost doctrines. From the gypsies helearned much concerning the uses of simples, and apparently from the Arabiansconcerning the making of talismans and the influences of the heavenly bodies.Paracelsus felt that the healing of the sick was of far greater importance thanthe maintaining of an orthodox medical standing, so he sacrificed what mightotherwise have been a dignified medical career and at the cost of lifelongpersecution bitterly attacked the therapeutic systems of his day.Uppermost in his mind was the hypothesis that everything in the universe is goodfor something—which accounts for his cutting fungus from tombstones andcollecting dew on glass plates at midnight. He was a true explorer of Nature’sarcanum. Many authorities have held the opinion that he was the discoverer ofmesmerism, and that Mesmer evolved the art as the result of studying thewritings of this great Swiss physician.The utter contempt which Paracelsus felt for the narrow systems of medicine invogue during his lifetime, and his conviction of their inadequacy, are bestexpressed in his own quaint way: “But the number of diseases that originate fromsome unknown causes is far greater than those that come from mechanical causes,and for such diseases our physicians know no cure because not knowing suchcauses they cannot remove them. All they can prudently do is to observe thepatient and make their guesses about his condition; and the patient may restsatisfied if the medicines administered to him do no serious harm, and do notprevent his recovery. The best of our popular physicians are the ones that doleast harm. But, unfortunately, some poison their patients with mercury, otherspurge them or bleed them to death. There are some who have learned so much thattheir learning has driven out all their common sense, and there are others whocare a great deal more for their own profit than for the health of theirpatients. A disease does not change its state to accommodate itself to theknowledge of the physician, but the physician should understand the causes ofthe disease. A physician should be a servant of Nature, and not her enemy; heshould be able to guide and direct her in her struggle for life and not throw,by his unreasonable interference, fresh obstacles in the way of recovery.” (Fromthe Paragranum, translated by Franz Hartmann.)The belief that nearly all diseases have their origin in the invisible nature ofman (the Astrum) is a fundamental precept of Hermetic medicine, for whileHermetists in no way disregarded the physical body, they believed that man’smaterial constitution was an emanation from, or an objectification of, hisinvisible spiritual principles. A brief, but it is believed fairlycomprehensive, resume of the Hermetic principles of Paracelsus follows.There is one vital substance in Nature upon which all things subsist. It iscalled archœus, or vital life force, and is synonymous with the astral light orspiritual air of the ancients. In regard to this substance, Eliphas Levi haswritten: “Light, that creative agent, the vibrations of which are the movementand life of all things; light, latent in the universal ether, radiating aboutabsorbing centres, which, being saturated thereby, project movement and life intheir turn, so forming creative currents; light, astralized in the stars,animalized in animals, humanized in human beings; light, which vegetates allplants, glistens in metals, produces all forms of Nature and equilibrates all bythe laws of universal sympathy—this is the light which exhibits the phenomena ofmagnetism, divined by Paracelsus, which tinctures the blood, being released fromthe air as it is inhaled and discharged by the hermetic bellows of the lungs.”(The History of Magic.)This vital energy has its origin in the spiritual body of the earth. Everycreated thing has two bodies, one visible and substantial, the other invisibleand transcendent. The latter consists of an ethereal counterpart of the physicalform; it constitutes the vehicle of archœus, and may be called a vital body.This etheric shadow sheath is not dissipated by death, but remains until thephysical form is entirely disintegrated. These “etheric doubles,” seen aroundgraveyards, have given rise to a belief in ghosts. Being much finer in itssubstances than the earthly body, the etheric double is far more susceptible toimpulses and inharmonies. It is derangements of this astral light body thatcause much disease. Paracelsus taught that a person with a morbid mentalattitude could poison his own etheric nature, and this infection, diverting thenatural flow of vital life force, would later appear as a physical ailment. Allplants and minerals have an invisible nature composed of this “archæus,” buteach manifests it in a different way.Concerning the astral-light bodies of flowers, James Gaffarel, in 1650, wrotethe following: “I answer, that though they be chopt in pieces, brayed in aMortar, and even burnt to Ashes; yet do they neverthelesse retaine, (by a cer-taine Secret, and wonderfull Power of Nature), both in the Juyce, and in theAshes, the selfe same Forme, and Figure, that they had before: and though it benot there Visible, yet it may by Art be drawne forth, and made Visible to theEye, by an Artist. This perhaps will seem a Ridiculous story to those, who readeonly the Titles of Bookes: but, those that please, may see this truth confirmed,if they but have recourse to the Workes of M. du Chesne, S. de la Violette, oneof the best Chymists that our Age hath produced; who affirmes, that himselfe sawan Excellent Polich Physician of Cracovia, who kept, in Glasses, the Ashes ofalmost all the Hearbs that are knowne: so that, when any one, out of Curiosity,had a desire to see any of them, as (for example) a Rose, in one of his Glasses,he tooke That where the Ashes of a Rose were preserved; and holding it over alighted Candle, so soone as it ever began to feele the Heat, you shouldpresently see the Ashes begin to Move; which afterwards rising up, anddispersing themselves about the Glasse, you should immediately observe a kind oflittle Dark Cloud; which dividing it selfe into many parts, it came at length torepresent a Rose; but so Faire, so Fresh, and so Perfect a one, that you wouldhave thought it to have been as Substancial, & as Odoriferous a Rose, as groweson the Rose-tree.” (Unheard-of Curiosities Concerning Talismanical Sculpture ofthe Persians.)Paracelsus, recognizing derangements of the etheric double as the most importantcause of disease, sought to reharmonize its substances by bringing into contactwith it other bodies whose vital energy could supply elements needed, or werestrong enough to overcome the diseased conditions existing in the aura of thesufferer. Its invisible cause having been thus removed, the ailment speedilyvanished.The vehicle for the archæus, or vital life force, Paracelsus called the mumia. Agood example of a physical mumia is vaccine, which is the vehicle of asemi-astral virus. Anything which serves as a medium for the transmission of thearchaeus, whether it be organic or inorganic, truly physical or partlyspiritualized, was termed a mumia. The most universal form of the mumia wasether, which modern science has accepted as a hypothetical substance serving asa medium between the realm of vital energy and that of organic and inorganicsubstance.The control of universal energy is virtually impossible, save through one of itsvehicles (the mumia). A good example of this is food. Man does not securenourishment from dead animal or plant organisms, but when he incorporates theirstructures into his own body he first gains control over the mumia, or ethericdouble, of the animal or plant. Having obtained this control, the human organismthen diverts the flow of the archæus to its own uses. Paracelsus says: “Thatwhich constitutes life is contained in the Mumia, and by imparting the Mumia weimpart life.” This is the secret of the remedial properties of talismans andamulets, for the mumia of the substances of which they are composed serves as achannel to connect the person wearing them with certain manifestations of theuniversal vital life force.According to Paracelsus, in the same way that plants purify the atmosphere byaccepting into their constitutions the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals andhumans, so may plants and animals accept disease elements transferred to them byhuman beings. These lower forms of life, having organisms and needs differentfrom man, are often able to assimilate these substances without ill effect. Atother times, the plant or animal dies, sacrificed in order that the moreintelligent, and consequently more useful, creature may survive. Paracelsusdiscovered that in either case the patient was gradually relieved of his malady.When the lower life had either completely assimilated the foreign mumia from thepatient, or had itself died and disintegrated as the result of its inability todo so, complete recovery resulted. Many years of investigation were necessary todetermine which herb or animal most readily accepted the mumia of each ofvarious diseases.Paracelsus discovered that in many cases plants revealed by their shape theparticular organs of the human body which they served most effectively. Themedical system of Paracelsus was based on the theory that by removing thediseased etheric mumia from the organism of the patient and causing it to beaccepted into the nature of some distant and disinterested thing ofcomparatively little value, it was possible to divert from the patient the flowof the archæus which had been continually revitalizing and nourishing themalady. Its vehicle of expression being transplanted, the archaeus necessarilyaccompanied its mumia, and the patient recovered."},{"pageContent":"THE HERMETIC THEORY CONCERNING THE CAUSATIONS OF DISEASE According to the Hermetic philosophers, there were seven primary causes ofdisease. The first was evil spirits. These were regarded as creatures born ofdegenerate actions, subsisting on the vital energies of those to whom theyattached themselves. The second cause was a derangement of the spiritual natureand the material nature: these two, failing to coordinate, produced mental andphysical subnormality. The third was an unhealthy or abnormal mental attitude.Melancholia, morbid emotions, excess of feeling, such as passions, lusts,greeds, and hates, affected the mumia, from which they reacted into the physicalbody, where they resulted in ulcers, tumors, cancers, fevers, and tuberculosis.The ancients viewed the disease germ as a unit of mumia which had beenimpregnated with the emanations from evil influences which it had contacted. Inother words, germs were minute creatures born out of man’s evil thoughts andactions.The fourth cause of disease was what the Orientals called Karma, that is, theLaw of Compensation, which demanded that the individual pay in full for theindiscretions and delinquencies of the past. A physician had to be very carefulhow he interfered with the workings of this law, lest he thwart the plan ofEternal Justice. The fifth cause was the motion and aspects of the heavenlybodies. The stars did not compel the sickness but rather impelled it. TheHermetists taught that a strong and wise man ruled his stars, but that anegative, weak person was ruled by them. These five causes of disease are allsuperphysical in nature. They must be estimated by inductive and deductivereasoning and a careful consideration of the life and temperament of thepatient.The sixth cause of disease was a misuse of faculty, organ, or function, such asoverstraining a member or overtaxing the nerves. The seventh cause was thepresence in the system of foreign substances, impurities, or obstructions. Underthis heading must be considered diet, air, sunlight, and the presence of foreignbodies. This list does not include accidental injuries; such do not belong underthe heading of disease. Frequently they are methods by which the Law of Karmaexpresses itself.According to the Hermetists, disease could be prevented or successfully combatedin seven ways. First, by spells and invocations, in which the physician orderedthe evil spirit causing the disease to depart from the patient. This procedurewas probably based on the Biblical account of the man possessed of devils whomJesus healed by commanding the devils to leave the man and enter into a herd ofswine. Sometimes the evil spirits entered a patient at the bidding of someonedesiring to injure him. In these cases the physician commanded the spirits toreturn to the one who sent them. It is recorded that in some instances the evilspirits departed through the mouth in the form of clouds of smoke; sometimesfrom the nostrils as flames. It is even averred that the spirits might depart inthe form of birds and insects.The second method of healing was by vibration. The inharmonies of the bodieswere neutralized by chanting spells and intoning the sacred names or by playingupon musical instruments and singing. Sometimes articles of various colors wereexposed to the sight of the sick, for the ancients recognized, at least in part,the principle of color therapeutics, now in the process of rediscovery.The third method was with the aid of talismans, charms, and amulets. Theancients believed that the planets controlled the functions of the human bodyand that by making charms out of different metals they could combat themalignant influences of the various stars. Thus, a person who is anæmic lacksiron. Iron was believed to be under the control of Mars. Therefore, in order tobring the influence of Mars to the sufferer, around his neck was hung a talismanmade of iron and bearing upon it certain secret instructions reputed to have thepower of invoking the spirit of Mars. If there was too much iron in the system,the patient was subjected to the influence of a talisman composed of the metalcorresponding to some planet having an antipathy to Mars. This influence wouldthen offset the Mars energy and thus aid in restoring normality.The fourth method was by the aid of herbs and simples. While they used metaltalismans, the majority of the ancient physicians did not approve of mineralmedicine in any form for internal use. Herbs were their favorite remedies. Likethe metals, each herb was assigned to one of the planets. Having diagnosed bythe stars the sickness and its cause, the doctors then administered the herbalantidote.The fifth method of healing disease was by prayer. All ancient peoples believedin the compassionate intercession of the Deity for the alleviation of humansuffering. Paracelsus said that faith would cure all disease. Few persons,however, possess a sufficient degree of faith.The sixth method—which was prevention rather than cure—was regulation of thediet and daily habits of life. The individual, by avoiding the things whichcaused illness, remained well. The ancients believed that health was the normalstate of man; disease was the result of man’s disregard of the dictates ofNature.The seventh method was “practical medicine,” consisting chiefly of bleeding,purging, and similar lines of treatment. These procedures, while useful inmoderation, were dangerous in excess. Many a useful citizen has died twenty-fiveor fifty years before his time as the result of drastic purging or of having allthe blood drained out of his body.Paracelsus used all seven methods of treatment, and even his worst enemiesadmitted that he accomplished results almost miraculous in character. Near hisold estate in Hohenheim, the dew falls very heavily at certain seasons of theyear, and Paracelsus discovered that by gathering the dew under certainconfigurations of the planets he obtained a water possessing marvelous medicinalvirtue, for it had absorbed the properties of the heavenly bodies."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC HERBALISM AND PHARMACOLOGY The herbs of the fields were sacred to the early pagans, who believed that thegods had made plants for the cure of human ills. When properly prepared andapplied, each root and shrub could be used for the alleviation of suffering, orfor the development of spiritual, mental, moral, or physical powers. In TheMistletoe and Its Philosophy, P. Davidson pays the following beautiful tributeto the plants: “Books have been written on the language of flowers and herbs,the poet from the earliest ages has held the sweetest and most loving conversewith them, kings are even glad to obtain their essences at second hand toperfume themselves; but to the true physician—Nature’s High-Priest-they speak ina far higher and more exalted strain. There is not a plant or mineral which hasdisclosed the last of its properties to the scientists. How can they feelconfident that for every one of the discovered properties there may not be manypowers concealed in the inner nature of the plant? Well have flowers been calledthe ‘Stars of Earth,’and why should they not be beautiful? Have they not fromthe time of their birth smiled in the splendor of the sun by day, and slumberedunder the brightness of the stars by night? Have they not come from another andmore spiritual world to our earth, seeing that God made ‘every plant of thefield BEFORE it was in the earth, and every herb of the field BEFORE IT GREW’?”Many primitive peoples used herbal remedies, with many remarkable cures. TheChinese, Egyptians, and American Indians cured with herbs diseases for whichmodern science knows no remedy. Doctor Nicholas Culpeper, whose useful lifeended in 1654, was probably the most famous of herbalists. Finding that themedical systems of his day were unsatisfactory in the extreme, Culpeper turnedhis attention to the plants of the fields, and discovered a medium of healingwhich gained for him national renown.In Doctor Culpeper’s correlation of astrology and herbalism, each plant wasunder the jurisdiction of one of the planets or luminaries. He believed thatdisease was also controlled by celestial configurations. He summed up his systemof treatment as follows: “You may oppose diseases by Herbs of the planetopposite to the planet that causes them: as diseases of Jupiter by Herbs ofMercury, and the contrary; diseases of the Luminaries by the Herbs of Saturn,and the contrary; diseases of Mars by Herbs of Venus and the contrary. * * *There is a way to cure diseases sometimes by Sympathy, and so every planet cureshis own disease; as the Sun and Moon by their Herbs cure the Eyes, Saturn theSpleen, Jupiter the Liver, Mars the Gall and diseases of choler, and Venusdiseases in the Instruments of Generation.” (The Complete Herbal.)Mediaeval European herbalists rediscovered only in part the ancient Hermeticsecrets of Egypt and Greece. These earlier nations evolved the fundamentals ofnearly all modern arts and sciences. At that time the methods used in healingwere among the secrets imparted to initiates of the Mysteries. Unctions,collyria, philters, and potions were concocted to the accompaniment of strangerites. The effectiveness of these medicines is a matter of historical record.Incenses and perfumes were also much used.Barrett in his Magus describes the theory on which they worked, as follows:“For, because our spirit is the pure, subtil, lucid, airy and unctuous vapour ofthe blood, nothing, therefore, is better adapted for collyriums than the likevapours which are more suitable to our spirit in substance; for then, by reasonof their likeness, they do more stir up, attract and transform the spirit.”093 [images/00094.jpg] CHEMICAL SYLLABLES.De Monte-Snyders declares that each of the above characters forms one syllableof a word having seven syllables, the word itself representing the moterioprima, or first substance of the universe. As all the substance is composed ofseven powers combined according to certain cosmic laws, a great mystery isconcealed within the sevenfold constitution of God, man, and the universe. Ofthe above seven characters, De Monte-Snyders writes: “Whoever wants to know thetrue name and character of the materia prima shall know that out of thecombination of the above figures syllables are produced, and out of these theverbum significativum.” Poisons were thoroughly studied, and in some communities extracts of deadlyherbs were administered to persons sentenced to death—as in the case ofSocrates. The infamous Borgias of Italy developed the art of poisoning to itshighest degree. Unnumbered brilliant men and women were quietly and efficientlydisposed of by the almost superhuman knowledge of chemistry which for manycenturies was preserved in the Borgia family.Egyptian priests discovered herb extracts by means of which temporaryclairvoyance could be induced, and they made use of these during the initiatoryrituals of their Mysteries. The drugs were sometimes mixed with the food givento candidates; and at other times were presented in the form of sacred potions,the nature of which was explained. Shortly after the drugs were administered tohim, the neophyte was attacked by a spell of dizziness. He found himselffloating through space, and while his physical body was absolutely insensible(being guarded by priests that no ill should befall it) the candidate passedthrough a number of weird experiences, which he was able to relate afterregaining consciousness. In the light of present-day knowledge, it is difficultto appreciate an art so highly developed that by means of draughts, perfumes,and incenses any mental attitude desired could be induced almostinstantaneously, yet such an art actually existed among the priestcraft of theearly pagan world.Concerning this subject, H. P. Blavatsky, the foremost occultist of thenineteenth century, has written: “Plants also have like mystical properties in amost wonderful degree, and the secret of the herbs of dreams and enchantmentsare only lost to European science, and useless to say, too, are unknown to it,except in a few marked instances, such as opium and hashish. Yet, the psychicaleffects of even these few upon the human system are regarded as evidences of atemporary mental disorder. The women of Thessaly and Epirus, the femalehierophants of the rites of Sabazius, did not carry their secrets away with thedownfall of their sanctuaries. They are still preserved, and those who are awareof the nature of Soma, know the properties of other plants as well.” (IsisUnveiled.)Herbal compounds were used to cause temporary clairvoyance in connection withthe oracles, especially the one at Delphi. Words spoken while in these imposedtrances were regarded as prophetic. Modern mediums, while under control as theresult of partly self-imposed catalepsy, give messages somewhat similar to thoseof the ancient prophets, but in the majority of cases their results are far lessaccurate, for the soothsayers of today lack the knowledge of Nature’s hiddenforces. ,The Mysteries taught that during the higher degrees of initiation the godsthemselves took part in the instruction of candidates or at least were present,which was in itself a benediction. As the deities dwelt in the invisible worldsand came only in their spiritual bodies, it was impossible for the neophyte tocognize them without the assistance of drugs which stimulated the clairvoyantcenter of his consciousness (probably the pineal gland). Many initiates in theancient Mysteries stated emphatically that they had conversed with theimmortals, and had beheld the gods.When the standards of the pagans became corrupted, a division took place in theMysteries. The band of truly enlightened ones separated themselves from the restand, preserving the most important of their secrets, vanished without leaving atrace. The rest slowly drifted, like rudderless ships, on the rocks ofdegeneracy and disintegration. Some of the less important of the secret formulaefell into the hands of the profane, who perverted them-as in the case of theBacchanalia, during which drugs were mixed with wine and became the real causeof the orgies.In certain parts of the earth it was maintained that there were natural wells,springs, or fountains, in which the water (because of the minerals through whichit coursed) was tinctured with sacred properties. Temples were often built nearthese spots, and in some cases natural caves which chanced to be in the vicinitywere sanctified to some deity“The aspirants to initiation, and those who came to request prophetic dreams ofthe Gods, were prepared by a fast, more or less prolonged, after which theypartook of meals expressly prepared; and also of mysterious drinks, such as thewater of Lethe, and the water of Mnemosyne in the grotto of Trophonius; or ofthe Ciceion in the mysteries of the Eleusinia. Different drugs were easily mixedup with the meats or introduced into the drinks, according to the state of mindor body into which it was necessary to throw the recipient, and the nature ofthe visions he was desirous of procuring.” (Salverte’s The Occult Sciences.) Thesame author states that certain sects of early Christianity were accused ofusing drugs for the same general purposes as the pagans.The sect of the Assassins, or the Yezidees as they are more generally known,demonstrated a rather interesting aspect of the drug problem. In the eleventhcentury this order, by capturing the fortress of Mount Alamont, establisheditself at Irak. Hassan Sabbah, the founder of the order, known as the “Old Manof the Mountain,” is suspected of having controlled his followers by the use ofnarcotics. Hassan made his followers believe that they were in Paradise, wherethey would be forever if they implicitly obeyed him while they were alive. DeQuincey, in his Confessions of an Opium Eater, describes the peculiarpsychological effects produced by this product of the poppy, and the use of asimilar drug may have given rise to the idea of Paradise which filled the mindsof the Yezidees.The philosophers of all ages have taught that the visible universe was but afractional part of the whole, and that by analogy the physical body of man is inreality the least important part of his composite constitution. Most of themedical systems of today almost entirely ignore the superphysical man. They paybut scant attention to causes, and concentrate their efforts on amelioratingeffects. Paracelsus, noting the same proclivity on the part of physicians duringhis day, aptly remarked: “There is a great difference between the power thatremoves the invisible causes of disease, and which is Magic, and that whichcauses merely external effects [to] disappear, and which is Physic, Sorcery, andQuackery.” (Translated by Franz Hartmann.)Disease is unnatural, and is evidence that there is a maladjustment within orbetween organs or tissues. Permanent health cannot be regained until harmony isrestored. The outstanding virtue of Hermetic medicine was its recognition ofspiritual and psychophysical derangements as being largely responsible for thecondition which is called physical disease. Suggestive therapy was used withmarked success by the priest-physicians of the ancient world. Among the AmericanIndians, the Shamans—or “Medicine Men”—dispelled sickness with the aid ofmysterious dances, invocations, and charms. The fact that in spite of theirignorance of modern methods of medical treatment these sorcerers effectedinnumerable cures, is well worthy of consideration.The magic rituals used by the Egyptian priests for the curing of disease werebased upon a highly developed comprehension of the complex workings of the humanmind and its reactions upon the physical constitution. The Egyptian and Brahminworlds undoubtedly understood the fundamental principle of vibrotherapeutics. Bymeans of chants and mantras, which emphasized certain vowel and consonantsounds, they set up vibratory reactions which dispelled congestions and assistedNature in reconstructing broken members and depleted organisms. They alsoapplied their knowledge of the laws governing vibration to the spiritualconstitution of man; by their intonings, they stimulated latent centers ofconsciousness and thereby vastly increased the sensitiveness of the subjectivenature.In the Book of Coming Forth by Day, many of the Egyptian secrets have beenpreserved to this generation. While this ancient scroll has been welltranslated, only a few understand the secret significance of its magicalpassages. Oriental races have a keen realization of the dynamics of sound. Theyknow that every spoken word has tremendous power and that by certainarrangements of words they can create vortices of force in the invisibleuniverse about them and thereby profoundly influence physical substance. TheSacred Word by which the world was established, the Lost Word which Masonry isstill seeking, and the threefold Divine Name symbolized by A. U. M.—the creativetone of the Hindus—all are indicative of the veneration accorded the principleof sound.The so-called “new discoveries” of modern science are often only rediscov- eriesof secrets well known to the priests and philosophers of ancient pagandom. Man’sinhumanity to man has resulted in the loss of records and formulae which, hadthey been preserved, would have solved many of the greatest problems of thiscivilization. With sword and firebrand, races obliterate the records of theirpredecessors, and then inevitably meet with an untimely fate for need of thevery wisdom they have destroyed."},{"pageContent":"XXV The Qabbalah, the Secret Doctrine of Israel Albert Pike, quoting from Transcendental Magic, thus sums up the importance ofQabbalism as a key to Masonic esotericism : “One is filled with admiration, onpenetrating into the Sanctuary of the Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical,so simple, and at the same time so absolute. The necessary union of ideas andsigns, the consecration of the most fundamental realities by the primitivecharacters; the Trinity of Words, Letters, and Numbers; a philosophy simple asthe alphabet, profound and infinite as the Word; theorems more complete andluminous than those of Pythagoras; a theology summed up by counting on one’sfingers; an Infinite which can be held in the hollow of an infant’s hand; tenciphers and twenty-two letters, a triangle, a square, and a circle,—these areall the elements of the Kabalah. These are the elementary principles of thewritten Word, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world!” (Moralsand Dogma.)Hebrew theology was divided into three distinct parts. The first was the law,the second was the soul of the law, and the third was the soul of the soul ofthe law. The law was taught to all the children of Israel; the Mishna, or thesoul of the law, was revealed to the Rabbins and teachers; but the Qabbalah, thesoul of the soul of the law, was cunningly concealed, and only the highestInitiates among the Jews were instructed in its secret principles.According to certain Jewish mystics, Moses ascended Mount Sinai three times,remaining in the presence of God forty days each time. During the first fortydays the tables of the written law were delivered to the prophet; during thesecond forty days he received the soul of the law; and during the last fortydays God instructed him in the mysteries of the Qabbalah, the soul of the soulof the law. Moses concealed in the first four books of the Pentateuch the secretinstructions that God had given him, and for centuries students of Qabbalismhave sought therein the secret doctrine of Israel. As the spiritual nature ofman is concealed in his physical body, so the unwritten law—the Mishna and theQabbalah —is concealed within the written teachings of the Mosaic code. Qabbalahmeans the secret or hidden tradition, the unwritten law, and according to anearly Rabbi, it was delivered to man in order that through the aid of itsabstruse principles he might learn to understand the mystery of both theuniverse about him and the universe within him.The origin of Qabbalism is a legitimate subject for controversy. Early initiatesof the Qabbalistic Mysteries believed that its principles were first taught byGod to a school of His angels before the fall of man. The angels latercommunicated the secrets to Adam, so that through the knowledge gained from anunderstanding of its principles fallen humanity might regain its lost estate.The Angel Raziel was dispatched from heaven to instruct Adam in the mysteries ofthe Qabbalah. Different angels were employed to initiate the succeedingpatriarchs in this difficult science. Tophiel was the teacher of Shem, Raphaelof Isaac, Metatron of Moses, and Michael of David. (See Faiths of the World.)Christian D. Ginsburg has written: “From Adam it passed over to Noah, and thento Abraham, the friend of God, who emigrated with it to Egypt, where thepatriarch allowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze out. It was inthis way that the Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the other Easternnations could introduce it into their philosophical systems. Moses, who waslearned in all the wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated into it in the land ofhis birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in thewilderness, when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole fortyyears, but received lessons in it from one of the angels. * * * Moses alsoinitiated the seventy Elders into the secrets of this doctrine and they againtransmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who formed the unbroken line oftradition, David and Solomon were most initiated into the Kabbalah.” (See TheKabbalah.)According to Eliphas Levi, the three greatest books of Qabbalism are the SepherYetzirah, The Book of Formation; the Sepher ha Zohar, The Book of Splendor; andthe Apocalypse, The Book of Revelation. The dates of the writing of these booksare by no means thoroughly established. Qabbalists declare that the SepherYetzirah was written by Abraham. Although it is by far the oldest of theQabbalistic books, it was probably from the pen of the Rabbi Akiba, A.D. 120.The Sepher ha Zohar presumably was written by Simeon ben Jochai, a disciple ofAkiba. Rabbi Simeon was sentenced to death about A.D. 161 by Lucius Verus,co-regent of the Emperor Marc Aurelius Antoninus. He escaped with his son and,hiding in a cave, transcribed the manuscript of the Zohar with the assistance ofElias, who appeared to them at intervals. Simeon was twelve years in the cave,during which time he evolved the complicated symbolism of the “Greater Face” andthe “Lesser Face.” While discoursing with disciples Rabbi Simeon expired, andthe “Lamp of Israel” was extinguished. His death and burial were accompanied bymany supernatural phenomena. The legend goes on to relate that the secretdoctrines of Qabbalism had been in existence since the beginning of the world,but that Rabbi Simeon was the first man permitted to reduce them to writing.Twelve hundred years later the books which he had compiled were discovered andpublished for the benefit of humanity by Moses de León. The probability is thatMoses de León himself compiled the Zohar about A.D. 1305, drawing his materialfrom the unwritten secrets of earlier Jewish mystics. The Apocalypse, accreditedto St. John the Divine, is also of uncertain date, and the identity of itsauthor has never been satisfactorily proved.Because of its brevity and because it is the key to Qabbalistic thought, theSepher Yetzirah is reproduced in full in this chapter. So far as is known, theSepher ha Zohar has never been completely translated into English, but it can beobtained in French. (S. L. MacGregor-Mathers translated three books of the Zoharinto English.) The Zohar contains a vast number of philosophical tenets, and aparaphrase of its salient points is embodied in this work.Few realize the influence exerted by Qabbalism over mediaeval thought, bothChristian and Jewish. It taught that there existed within the sacred writings ahidden doctrine which was the key to those writings. This is symbolized by thecrossed keys upon the papal crest. Scores of learned minds began to search forthose arcane truths by which the race should be redeemed; and that their laborwas not without its reward, their subsequent writings have demonstrated.The theories of Qabbalism are inextricably interwoven with the tenets ofalchemy, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry. The words Qabbalism andHermeticism are now considered as synonymous terms covering all the arcana andesotericism of antiquity. The simple Qabbalism of the first centuries of theChristian Era gradually evolved into an elaborate theological system, whichbecame so involved that it was next to impossible to comprehend its dogma.The Qabbalists divided the uses of their sacred science into five sections. TheNatural Qabbalah was used solely to assist the investigator in his study ofNature’s mysteries. The Analogical Qabbalah was formulated to exhibit therelationship which exists between all things in Nature, and it revealed to thewise that all creatures and substances were one in essence, and that man—theLittle Universe—was a replica in miniature of God—the Great Universe. TheContemplative Qabbalah was evolved for the purpose of revealing through thehigher intellectual faculties the mysteries of the celestial spheres. By its aidthe abstract reasoning faculties cognized the measureless planes of infinity andlearned to know the creatures existing within them. The Astrological Qabbalahinstructed those who studied its lore in the power, magnitude, and actualsubstance of the sidereal bodies, and also revealed the mystical constitution ofthe planet itself. The fifth, or Magical Qabbalah, was studied by such asdesired to gain control over the demons and subhuman intelligences of theinvisible worlds. It was also highly valued as a method of healing the sick bytalismans, amulets, charms, and invocations.094 [images/00095.jpg] THE TETRAGRAMMATON. By arranging the four letters of the Great Name,095 [images/00096.jpg](IHVH), inthe form of the Pythagorean Tetractys, the 72 powers of the Great Name of Godare manifested. The key to the problem is as follows:096 [images/00097.jpg] The Sepher Yetzirah, according to Adolph Franck, differs from other sacred booksin that it does not explain the world and the phenomena of which it is the stageby leaning on the idea of God or by setting itself up as the interpreter of thesupreme will. This ancient work rather reveals God by estimating His manifoldhandiwork. In preparing the Sepher Yetzirah for the consideration of the reader,five separate English translations have been compared. The resulting form, whileit embodies the salient features of each, is not a direct translation from anyone Hebrew or Latin text. Although the purpose was to convey the spirit ratherthan the letter of the ancient document, there are no wide deviations from theoriginal rendition. So far as known, the first translation of the SepherYetzirah into English was made by the Rev. Dr. Isidor Kalisch, in 1877. (SeeArthur Edward Waite.) In this translation the Hebrew text accompanies theEnglish words. The work of Dr. Kalisch has been used as the foundation of thefollowing interpretation, but material from other authorities has beenincorporated and many passages have been rewritten to simplify the generaltheme.At hand also was a manuscript copy in English of the Book of the CabalistickArt, by Doctor John Pistor. The document is undated; but judging from thegeneral type of the writing, the copy was made during the eighteenth century.The third volume used as a reference was the Sepher Yetzirah, by the late Wm.Wynn Westcott, Magus of the Rosicrucian Society of England. The fourth was theSepher Yetzirah, or The Book of Creation, according to the translation in theSacred Books and Early Literature of the East, edited by Prof. Charles F. Horne.The fifth was a recent publication, The Book of Formation, by Knut Stenring,containing an introduction by Arthur Edward Waite. At hand also were four othercopies—two German, one Hebrew, and one Latin. Certain portions of the SepherYetzirah are considered older and more authentic than the rest, but thecontroversy regarding them is so involved and nonproductive that it is uselessto add further comment. The doubtful passages are therefore included in thedocument at the points where they would naturally fall."},{"pageContent":"THE SEPHER YETZIRAH, THE BOOK OF FORMATION "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE > 1.

Ten are the numbers (of the Sephiroth) out of Nothing, ten—not nine;> ten—not eleven. Comprehend this great wisdom, understand this knowledge and be> wise. Inquire into the mystery and ponder it.

The ten ineffable Sephiroth have ten infinitudes, which are as follows:> > The infinite beginning and the infinite end;> > The infinite good and the infinite evil;> > The infinite height and the infinite depth;> > The infinite East and the infinite West;> > The infinite North and the infinite South;> > > and over them is the Lord Superlatively One, the faithful King.

The appearance of the ten spheres (Sephiroth) out of Nothing is as a flash> of lightning or a sparkling flame, and they are without beginning or end.

That which remains—when every knowable thing has beenremoved—is AIN SOPH, the eternal state of Being. Although indefinable, theAbsolute permeates all space. Abstract to the degree of inconceivability, AINSOPH is the unconditioned state of all things. Substances, essences, andintelligences are manifested out of the inscrutability of AIN SOPH, but theAbsolute itself is without substance, essence, or intelligence. AIN SOPH may belikened to a great field of rich earth out of which rises a myriad of plants,each different in color, formation, and fragrance, yet each with its roots inthe same dark loam—which, however, is unlike any of the forms nurtured by it.The “plants” are universes, gods, and man, all nourished by AIN SOPH and allwith their source in one definitionless essence; all with their spirits, souls,and bodies fashioned from this essence, and doomed, like the plant, to return tothe black ground—AIN SOPH, the only Immortal—whence they came.AIN SOPH was referred to by the Qabbalists as The Most Ancient of all theAncients. It was always considered as sexless. Its symbol was a closed eye.While it may be truly said of AIN SOPH that to define It is to defile It, theRabbis postulated certain theories regarding the manner in which AIN SOPHprojected creations out of Itself, and they also assigned to this AbsoluteNot-Being certain symbols as being descriptive, in part at least, of Its powers.The nature of AIN SOPH they symbolize by a circle, itself emblematic ofeternity. This hypothetical circle encloses a dimensionless area ofincomprehensible life, and the circular boundary of this life is abstract andmeasureless infinity.148 [images/00149.jpg] THE HEBREW TRIAD.The Qabbalists used the letter. Shin, to signify the trinity of the first threeSephiroth. The central circle slightly above the other two is the firstSephira—Kether, the White Head, the Crown. The other two circles representChochmah, the Father, and Binah, the Mother. From the union of the Divine Fatherand the Divine Mother are produced the worlds and the generations of livingthings. The three flame-like points of the letter have long been used to concealthis Creative Triad of the Qabbalists. According to this concept, God is not only a Center but also Area.Centralization is the first step towards limitation. Therefore, centers whichform in the substances of AIN SOPH are finite because they are predestined todissolution back into the Cause of themselves, while AIN SOPH Itself is infinitebecause It is the ultimate condition of all things. The circular shape given toAIN SOPH signifies that space is hypothetically enclosed within a greatcrystal-like globe, outside of which there is nothing, not even a vacuum. Withinthis globe—symbolic of AIN SOPH—creation and dissolution take place. Everyelement and principle that will ever be used in the eternities of Kosmic birth,growth, and decay is within the transparent substances of this intangiblesphere. It is the Kosmic Egg which is not broken till the great day “Be WithUs,” which is the end of the Cycle of Necessity, when all things return to theirultimate cause.In the process of creation the diffused life of AIN SOPH retires from thecircumference to the center of the circle and establishes a point, which is thefirst manifesting One—the primitive limitation of the all-pervading O. When theDivine Essence thus retires from the circular boundary to the center, It leavesbehind the Abyss, or, as the Qabbalists term it, the Great Privation. Thus, inAIN SOPH is established a twofold condition where previously had existed butone. The first condition is the central point—the primitive objectified radianceof the eternal, subjectified life. About this radiance is darkness caused by thedeprivation of the life which is drawn to the center to create the first point,or universal germ. The universal AIN SOPH, therefore, no longer shines throughspace, but rather upon space from an established first point. Isaac Myerdescribes this process as follows: “The Ain Soph at first was filling All andthen made an absolute concentration into Itself which produced the Abyss, Deep,or Space, the Aveer Qadmon or Primitive Air, the Azoth; but this is notconsidered in the Qabbalah as a perfect void or vacuum, a perfectly empty Space,but is thought of as the Waters or Crystalline Chaotic Sea, in which was acertain degree of Light inferior to that by which all the created [worlds andhierarchies] were made.” (See The Qabbalah.)In the secret teachings of the Qabbalah it is taught that man’s body isenveloped in an ovoid of bubble-like iridescence, which is called the Auric Egg.This is the causal sphere of man. It bears the same relationship to man’sphysical body that die globe of AIN SOPH bears to Its treated universes. Infact, this Auric Egg is the AIN SOPH sphere of the entity called man. Inreality, therefore, the supreme consciousness of man is in this aura, whichextends in all directions and completely encircles his lower bodies. As theconsciousness in the Kosmic Egg is withdrawn into a central point, which is thencalled God—the Supreme One—so the consciousness in the Auric Egg of man isconcentrated, thereby causing the establishment of a point of consciousnesscalled the Ego. As the universes in Nature are formed from powers latent in theKosmic Egg, so everything used by man in all his incarnations throughout thekingdoms of Nature is drawn from the latent powers within his Auric Egg. Mannever passes from this egg; it remains even after death. His births, deaths, andrebirths all take place within it, and it cannot be broken until the lesser day“Be With Us,” when mankind—like the universe—is liberated from the Wheel ofNecessity."},{"pageContent":"THE QABBALISTIC SYSTEM OF WORLDS On the accompanying circular chart, the concentric rings representdiagrammatically the forty rates of vibration (called by the Qabbalists Spheres)which emanate from AIN SOPH. The circle X 1 is the outer boundary of space. Itcircumscribes the area of AIN SOPH. The nature of AIN SOPH Itself is dividedinto three parts, represented by the spaces respectively between X 1 and X 2, X2 and X 3, X 3 and A 1; thus:X 1 to X 2,149 [images/00150.jpg]AIN, the vacuum of pure spirit.X 2 to X 3,150 [images/00151.jpg]AIN SOPH, the Limitless and Boundless.X 3 to A 1,151 [images/00152.jpg]AIN SOPH AUR, the Limitless Light.It should be borne in mind that in the beginning the Supreme Substance, AIN,alone permeated the area of the circle; the inner rings had not yet come intomanifestation. As the Divine Essence concentrated Itself, the rings X 2 and X 3became apprehensible, for AIN SOPH is a limitation of AIN, and AIN SOPH AUR, orLight, is a still greater limitation. Thus the nature of the Supreme One isconsidered to be threefold, and from this threefold nature the powers andelements of creation were reflected into the Abyss left by the motion of AINSOPH towards the center of Itself. The continual motion of AIN SOPH towards thecenter of Itself resulted in the establishment of the dot in the circle. The dotwas called God, as being the supreme individualization of the Universal Essence.Concerning this the Zohar says:“When the concealed of the Concealed wished to reveal Himself He first made asingle point: the Infinite was entirely unknown, and diffused no light beforethis luminous point violently broke through into vision.”The name of this point is I AM, called by the Hebrews Eheieh. The Qabbalistsgave many names to this dot. On this subject Christian D. Ginsberg writes, insubstance: The dot is called the first crown, because it occupies the highestposition. It is called the aged, because it is the first emanation. It is calledthe primordial or smooth point. It is called the white head, the LongFace—Macroprosophus—and the inscrutable height, because it controls and governsall the other emanations.When the white shining point had appeared, it was called Kether, which means theCrown, and out of it radiated nine great globes, which arranged themselves inthe form of a tree. These nine together with the first crown constituted thefirst system of Sephiroth. These ten were the first limitation of ten abstractpoints within the nature of AIN SOPH Itself. The power of AIN SOPH did notdescend into these globes but rather was reflected upon them as the light of thesun is reflected upon the earth and planets. These ten globes were called theshining sapphires, and it is believed by many Rabbins that the word sapphire isthe basis of the word Sephira (the singular of Sephiroth). The great area whichhad been privated by the withdrawal of AIN SOPH into the central point, Kether,was now filled by four concentric globes called worlds, or spheres, and thelight of the ten Sephiroth was reflected down through each of these in turn.This resulted in the establishment of four symbolical trees, each bearing thereflections of the ten Sephirothic globes.The 40 spheres of creation out of AIN SOPH are divided into four great worldchains, as follows:A 1 to A 10, Atziluth, the Boundless World of Divine Names.B 1 to B 10, Briah, the Archangelic World of Creations.C 1 to C 10, Yetzirah, the Hierarchal World of Formations.D 1 to D 10, Assiah, the Elemental World of Substances.Each of these worlds has ten powers, or spheres—a parent globe and nine otherswhich come out of it as emanations, each globe born out of the one preceding. Onthe plane of Atziluth (A 1 to A 10), the highest and most divine of all thecreated worlds, the unmanifested AIN SOPH established His first point or dot inthe Divine Sea—the three spheres of X. This dot—A 1—contains all creation withinit, but in this first divine and uncontaminated state the dot, or firstmanifested God, was not considered as a personality by the Qabbalists but ratheras a divine establishment or foundation. It was called the First Crown and fromit issued the other circles of the Atziluthic World: A 2, A 3, A 4, A 5, A 6, A7, A 8, A 9, and A 10. In the three lower worlds these circles areintelligences, planets, and elements, but in this first divine world they arecalled the Rings of the Sacred Names.The first ten great circles (or globes) of light which were manifested out ofAIN SOPH and the ten names of God assigned to them by the Qabbalists are asfollows:From AIN SOPH came A 1, the First Crown, and the name of the first power of Godwas Eheieh, which means I Am [That I Am].From A 1 came A 2, the first Wisdom, and the name of the second power of God wasJehovah, which means Essence of Being.From A 2 came A 3, the first Understanding, and the name of the third power ofGod was Jehovah Elohim, which means God of Gods.From A 3 came A 4, the first Mercy, and the name of the fourth power of God wasEl, which means God the Creator.From A 4 came A 5, the first Severity, and the name of the fifth power of Godwas Elohim Gibor, which means God the Potent.From A 5 came A 6, the first Beauty, and the name of the sixth power of God wasEloah Vadaath, which means God the Strong.From A 6 came A 7, the first Victory, and the name of the seventh power of Godwas Jehovah Tzaboath, which means God of Hosts.From A 7 came A 8, the first Glory, and the name of the eighth power of God wasElohim Tzaboath, which means Lord God of Hosts.From A 8 came A 9, the first Foundation, and the name of the ninth power of Godwas Shaddai, El Chai, which means Omnipotent.From A 9 came A 10, the first Kingdom, and the name of the tenth power of Godwas Adonai Melekh, which means God.From A 10 came B 1, the Second Crown, and the World of Briah was established.The ten emanations from A 1 to A 10 inclusive are called the foundations of allcreations. The Qabbalists designate them the ten roots of the Tree of Life. Theyare arranged in the form of a great human figure called Adam Qadmon—the man madefrom the fire mist (red dirt), the prototypic Universal Man. In the AtziluthicWorld, the powers of God are most purely manifested. These ten pure and perfectradiations do not descend into the lower worlds and take upon themselves forms,but are reflected upon the substances of the inferior spheres. From the first,or Atziluthic, World they are reflected into the second, or Briatic, World. Asthe reflection always lacks some of the brilliancy of the original image, so inthe Briatic World the ten radiations lose part of their infinite power. Areflection is always like the thing reflected, but smaller and fainter.In the second world, B 1 to B 10, the order of the spheres is the same as in theAtziluthic World, but the ten circles of light are less brilliant and moretangible, and are here referred to as ten great Spirits—divine creatures whoassist in the establishment of order and intelligence in the universe. Asalready noted, B 1 is born out of A 10 and is included within all the spheressuperior to itself. Out of B 1 are taken nine globes—B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5, B 6, B7, B 8, B 9, and B 10—which constitute the World of Briah. These tensubdivisions, however, are really the ten Atziluthic powers reflected into thesubstance of the Briatic World. B 1 is the ruler of this world, for it containsall the other rings of its own world and also the rings of the third and fourthworlds, C and D. In the World of Briah the ten spheres of light are called theArchangels of Briah. Their order and powers are as follows:From A 10 came B 1, the Second Crown; it is called Metatron, the Angel of thePresence.From B 1 came B 2, the second Wisdom; it is called Raziel, the Herald of Deitywho revealed the mysteries of Qabbalah to Adam.From B 2 came B 3, the second Understanding; it is called Tsaphkiel, theContemplation of God.From B 3 came B 4, the second Mercy; it is called Tsadkiel, the Justice of God.From B 4 came B 5, the second Severity; it is called Samael, the Severity ofGod.From B 5 came B 6, the second Beauty; it is called Michael, Like Unto God.From B 6 came B 7, the second Victory; it is called Haniel, the Grace of God.From B 7 came B 8, the second Glory; it is called Raphael, the Divine Physician.From B 8 came B 9, the second Foundation; it is called Gabriel, the Man-God.From B 9 came B 10, the second Kingdom; it is called Sandalphon, the Messias.From B 10 came C 1, the Third Crown, and the World of Yetzirah was established.The ten Archangels of Briah are conceived to be ten great spiritual beings,whose duty is to manifest the ten powers of the Great Name of God existent inthe Atziluthic World, which surrounds and interpenetrates the entire world ofcreation. All things manifesting in the lower worlds exist first in theintangible rings of the upper spheres, so that creation is, in truth, theprocess of making tangible the intangible by extending the intangible intovarious vibratory rates. The ten globes of Briatic power, while themselvesreflections, are mirrored downward into the third or Yetziratic World, wherestill more limited in their expression they become the spiritual and invisiblezodiac which is behind the visible band of constellations. In this third worldthe ten globes of the original Atziluthic World are greatly limited and dimmed,but they are still infinitely powerful in comparison with the state of substancein which man dwells. In the third world, C 1 to C 10, the globes becomehierarchies of celestial creatures, called the Choirs of Yetzirah. Here again,all are included within the ring C 1, the power which controls the YetziraticWorld and which includes within itself and controls the entire world D. Theorder of the globes and the names of the hierarchies composing them are asfollows:152 [images/00153.jpg] THE PLAN OF DIVINE ACTIVITY.According to the Qabbalists, the life of the Supreme Creator permeates allsubstance, all space, and all time, but for diagrammatic purposes the Supreme,All-Inclusive Life is limited by Circle 3. which may be called “the boundaryline of Divine existence.” The Divine Life permeating the area bounded by Circle3 is focused at Point 1, which thus becomes the personification of theimpersonal life and is termed “the First Crown.” The creative forces pouringthrough Point 1 come into manifestation as the objective universe in theintermediate space, Circle 2. From B 10 came C 1, the Third Crown; the Hierarchy is the Cherubim, Chaioth HaKadosh, the Holy Animals.From C 1 came C 2, the third Wisdom; the Hierarchy is the Cherubim, Orphanim,the Wheels.From C 2 came C 3, the third Understanding; the Hierarchy is the Thrones,Aralim, the Mighty Ones.From C 3 came C 4, the third Mercy; the Hierarchy is the Dominations,Chashmalim, the Brilliant Ones.From C 4 came C 5, the third Severity; the Hierarchy is the Powers, Seraphim,the Flaming Serpents.From C 5 came C 6, the third Beauty; the Hierarchy is the Virtues, Melachim, theKings.From C 6 came C 7, the third Victory; the Hierarchy is the Principalities,Elohim, the Gods.From C 7 came C 8, the third Glory; the Hierarchy is the Archangels, Ben Elohim,the Sons of God.From C 8 came C 9, the third Foundation; the Hierarchy is the Angels, Cherubim,the Seat of the Sons.From C 9 came C 10, the third Kingdom; the Hierarchy is Humanity, the Ishim, theSouls of Just Men.From C 10 came D 1, the Fourth Crown, and the World of Assiah was established.From the Yetziratic World the light of the ten spheres is reflected into theWorld of Assiah, the lowest of the four. The ten globes of the originalAtziluthic World here take upon themselves forms of physical matter and thesidereal system is the result. The World of Assiah, or the elemental world ofsubstance, is the one into which humanity descended at the time of Adam’s fall.The Garden of Eden is the three upper worlds, and for his sins man was forcedinto the sphere of substance and assumed coats of skin (bodies). All of thespiritual forces of the upper worlds, A, B, C, when they strike against theelements of the lower world, D, are distorted and perverted, resulting in thecreation of hierarchies of demons to correspond with the good spirits in each ofthe higher worlds. In all the ancient Mysteries, matter was regarded as thesource of all evil and spirit the source of all good, for matter inhibits andlimits, often so clogging the inner perceptions that man is unable to recognizehis own divine potentialities. Since matter thus prevents humanity from claimingits birthright, it is called the Adversary, the power of evil. The fourth world,D, is the world of solar systems, comprising not only the one of which the earthis a part but all the solar systems in the universe.Opinions differ as to the arrangement of the globes of this last world, D 1 to D10 inclusive. The ruler of the fourth world is D 1, called by some the FieryHeaven; by others the Primum Mobile, or the First Motion. From this whirlingfire emanates the material starry zodiac, D 2, in contradistinction to theinvisible spiritual zodiac of the Yetziratic World. From the zodiac, D 2, aredifferentiated the spheres of the planets in concatenate order. The ten spheresof the World of Assiah are as follows:From C 10 came D 1, the Fourth Crown; Rashith Ha-Galagalum, the Primum Mobile,the fiery mist which is the beginning of the material universe.From D 1 came D 2, the fourth Wisdom; Masloth, the Zodiac, the Firmament of theFixed Stars.From D 2 came D 3, the fourth Understanding; Shabbathai, the sphere of Saturn.From D 3 came D 4, the fourth Mercy; Tzedeg, the sphere of Jupiter.From D 4 came D 5, the fourth Severity; Madim, the sphere of Mars.153 [images/00154.jpg] THE QABBALISTIC SCHEME OF THE FOUR WORLDS.In the above chart the dark line between X3 and A1 constitutes the boundary ofthe original dot, while the concentric circles within this heavier linesymbolize the emanations and worlds which came forth from the dot. As this dotis contained within the outer rings X 1, X 2, and X 3, and represents the firstestablishment of individualized existence, so the lower universe symbolized bythe forty concentric circles within the dot represents the lower creationevolved out of and yet contained within the nature of the first Crown, which maybe called God, within whom the divine powers, the celestial beings, the siderealworlds, and man, live and move and have their being. It is highly important thatall the rings within A1 be considered as being enclosed by the primitive dot,which is itself encircled by the great ring X1, or the Auric Egg of AIN SOPH.Each ring includes within its own nature all the rings within itself and isincluded within the natures of all the rings outside of itself. Thus, A 1—theprimitive dot—controls and contains the thirty-nine rings which it encloses, allof these partaking of its nature in varying degrees according to theirrespective dignities. Consequently, the entire area from A 1 to D 10 inclusiveis the original dot, and the rings symbolize the divisions which took placewithin it and the emanations which poured out from it after its establishment inthe midst of the abstract nature of AIN SOPH. The powers of the rings decreasetowards the center of the diagram, for power is measured by the number of thingscontrolled, and each ring controls the rings within it and is controlled by therings outside of it. Thus, while A 1 controls thirty-nine rings besides itself,B 1 controls only twenty-nine rings besides its own. Therefore, A 1 is morepowerful than B 1. As the greatest spiritual solidity, or permanence, is at thecircumference and the greatest material density, or impermanence, is at thecenter of the diagram, the rings as they decrease in power become more materialand substantial until the center sphere, D 10, symbolizes the actual chemicalelements of the earth. The rates of vibration are also lower as the ringsapproach the center. Thus, the vibration of A 2 is lower than A 1 but higherthan A 3, and so on in decreasing scale towards the center. A 1 being thehighest and D 10 the lowest sphere of creation. While A 1, the ruler ofcreation, controls the circles marked A, B, C, and D, it is less than the threerings of AIN SOPH-X 1, X 2, and X 3—and therefore bows before the throne of theineffable Creator from whose substances it was individualized.From D 5 came D 6, the fourth Beauty; Shemesh, the sphere of the Sun.From D 6 came D 7, the fourth Victory; Nogah, the sphere of Venus.From D 7 came D 8, the fourth Glory; Kokab, the sphere of Mercury.From D 8 came D 9, the fourth Foundation; Levanah, the sphere of the Moon.From D 9 came D 10, the Fourth Kingdom; Cholom Yosodoth, the sphere of the FourElements.By inserting a sphere (which he calls the Empyrean) before the Primum Mobile,Kircher moves each of the other spheres down one, resulting in the eliminationof the sphere of the elements and making D 10 the sphere of the Moon.In the World of Assiah are to be found the demons and tempters. These arelikewise reflections of the ten great globes of Atziluth, but because of thedistortion of the images resulting from the base substances of the World ofAssiah upon which they are reflected, they become evil creatures, called shellsby the Qabbalists. There are ten hierarchies of these demons to correlate withthe ten hierarchies of good spirits composing the Yetziratic World. There arealso ten Archdemons, corresponding to the ten Archangels of Briah. The blackmagicians use these inverted spirits in their efforts to attain their nefariousends, but in time the demon destroys those who bind themselves to it. The tenorders of demons and the ten Archdemons of the World of Assiah are as follows:D 1, the evil Crown; the hierarchy is called Thaumiel, the doubles of God, theTwo-headed; the Archdemons are Satan and Moloch.From D 1 came D 2, the evil Wisdom; the hierarchy is called Chaigidiel, thosewho obstruct; the Archdemon is Adam Belial.From D 2 came D 3, the evil Understanding; the hierarchy is called Sathar- ial,the concealment of God; the Archdemon is Lucifuge.From D 3 came D 4, the evil Mercy; the hierarchy is called Gamchicoth, thedisturber of things; the Archdemon is Astaroth.From D 4 came D 5, the evil Severity; the hierarchy is called Golab, incen-diarism and burning; the Archdemon is Asmodeus.From D 5 came D 6, the evil Beauty; the hierarchy is called Togarini, thewranglers; the Archdemon is Belphegor.From D 6 came D 7, the evil Victory; the hierarchy is called Harab Serap, thedispensing Raven; the Archdemon is Baal Chanan.From D7 came D8, the evil Glory; the hierarchy is called Samael, the embroiler;the Archdemon is Adramelek.From D 8 came D 9, the evil Foundation; the hierarchy is called Gamaliel, theobscene; the Archdemon is Lilith.From D 9 came D 10, the evil Kingdom; the hierarchy is called Nahemoth, theimpure; the Archdemon is Nahema.The Qabbalists declare that the worlds, intelligences, and hierarchies wereestablished according to the vision of Ezekiel. By the man of Ezekiel’s visionis symbolized the World of Atziluth; by the throne, the World of Briah; by thefirmament, the World of Yetzirah; and by the living creatures the World ofAssiah. These spheres are the wheels within wheels of the prophet. TheQabbalists next established a human figure in each of the four worlds: A 1 wasthe head and A 10 the feet of the man of Atziluth; B 1 was the head and B 10 thefeet of the man of Briah; C 1 was the head and C 10 the feet of the man ofYetzirah; D 1 was the head and D 10 the feet of the man of Assiah. These fourare called the World Men. They are considered androgynous and are the prototypesof humanity.The human body, like that of the universe, is considered to be a materialexpression of ten globes or spheres of light. Therefore man is called theMicrocosm —the little world, built in the image of the great world of which heis a part. The Qabbalists also established a mysterious universal man with hishead at A 1 and his feet at D 10. This is probably the secret significance ofthe great figure of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, with its head in the World ofAtziluth, its arms and hands in the World of Briah, its generative system in theWorld of Yetzirah, and its legs and feet in the World of Assiah. This is theGrand Man of the Zohar, of whom Eliphas Levi writes:“It is not less astonishing to observe at the beginning of the Zohar theprofundity of its notions and the sublime simplicity of its images. It is saidas follows: ‘The science of equilibrium is the key of occult science. Unbalancedforces perish in the void. So passed the kings of the elder world, the princesof the giants. They have fallen like trees without roots, and their place isfound no more. Through the conflict of unbalanced forces, the devastated earthwas void and formless, until the Spirit of God made for itself a place in heavenand reduced the mass of waters. All the aspirations of Nature were directed thentowards unity of form, towards the living synthesis of equilibrated forces; theface of God, crowned with light, rose over the vast sea and was reflected in thewaters thereof. His two eyes were manifested, radiating with splendour, dartingtwo beams of light which crossed with those of the reflection. The brow of Godand His eyes formed a triangle in heaven, and its reflection formed a secondtriangle in the waters. So was revealed the number six, being that of universalcreation.’ The text, which would be unintelligible in a literal version, istranslated here by way of interpretation. The author makes it plain that thehuman form which he ascribes to Deity is only an image of his meaning and thatGod is beyond expression by human thought or representation by any figure.Pascal said that God is a circle, of which the center is everywhere and thecircumference nowhere. But how is one to imagine a circle apart from itscircumference? The Zohar adopts the antithesis of this paradoxical image and inrespect of the circle of Pascal would say rather that the circumference iseverywhere, while that which is nowhere is the center. It is however to abalance and not to a circle that it compares the universal equilibrium ofthings. It affirms that equilibrium is everywhere and so also is the centralpoint where the balance hangs in suspension. We find that the Zohar is thus moreforcible and more profound than Pascal. * * * The Zohar is a genesis of light;the Sepher Yetzirah is a ladder of truth. Therein are expounded thetwo-and-thirty absolute symbols of speech—being numbers and letters. Each letterproduces a number, an idea and a form, so that mathematics are applicable toforms and ideas, even as to numbers, in virtue of an exact proportion, and aperfect correspondence. By the science of the Sepher Yetzirah, the human mind isrooted in truth and in reason; it accounts for all progress possible tointelligence by means of the evolution of numbers. Thus does the Zohar representabsolute truth, while the Sepher Yetzirah furnishes the method of itsacquisition, its discernment and application.” (History of Magic.)By placing man himself at the point D 10, his true constitution is revealed. Heexists upon four worlds, only one of which is visible. It is then made evidentthat his parts and members upon the material plane are, by analogy, hierarchiesand intelligences in the higher worlds. Here, again, the law of interpenetrationis evidenced. Although within man is the entire universe (the 43 spheresinterpenetrating D 10), he is ignorant of its existence because he cannotexercise control over that which is superior to or greater than himself.Nevertheless, all these higher spheres exercise control over him, as hisfunctions and activities demonstrate. If they did not, he would be an inert massof substance. Death is merely the result of deflecting the life impulses of thehigher rings away from the lower body.The control of the transubstantial rings over their own material reflection iscalled life, and the spirit of man is, in reality, a name given to this greathost of intelligences, which are focused upon substance through a point calledthe ego, established in the midst of themselves. X 1 is the outside boundary ofthe human Auric Egg, and the entire diagram becomes a cross section of theconstitution of man, or a cross section of the Kosmic constitution, ifcorrelated with the universe. By the secret culture of the Qabbalistic School,man is taught how to climb the rings (unfold his consciousness) until at last hereturns to AIN SOPH. The process by which this is accomplished is called theFifty Gates of Light. Kircher, the Jesuit Qabbalist, declares that Moses passedthrough forty-nine of the gates, but that Christ alone passed the fiftieth gate.To the third edition of the Sepher Yetzirah translated from the Hebrew by Wm.Wynn Westcott are appended the Fifty Gates of Intelligence emanating from Binah,the second Sephira. The source of this information is Kircher’s ŒdiPusÆgyptiacus. The gates are divided into six orders, of which the first four haveeach ten subdivisions, the fifth nine, and the sixth only one.The first order of gates is termed Elementary and its divisions are as follows:(1) Chaos, Hyle, the First Matter; (2) Formless, void, lifeless; (3) The Abyss;(4) Origin of the Elements; (5) Earth (no seed germs); (6) Water; (7) Air; (8)Fire; (9) Differentiation of qualities; (10) Mixture and combination.The second order of gates is termed Decad of Evolution and its divisions are asfollows: (11) Minerals differentiate; (12) Vegetable principles appear; (13)Seeds germinate in moisture; (14) Herbs and Trees; (15) Fructification invegetable life; (16) Origin of low forms of animal life; (17) Insects andReptiles appear; (18) Fishes, vertebrate life in the waters; (19) Birds,vertebrate life in the air; (20) Quadrupeds, vertebrate earth animals.The third order of gates is termed Decad of Humanity and its divisions are asfollows: (21) Appearance of Man; (22) Material human body; (23) Human Soulconferred; (24) Mystery of Adam and Eve; (25) Complete Man as the Microcosm;(26) Gift of five human faces acting exteriorly; (27) Gift of five powers to thesoul; (28) Adam Kadmon, the Heavenly Man; (29) Angelic beings; (30) Man in theimage of God.The fourth order of gates is termed World of Spheres and its divisions are asfollows: (31) The Heaven of the Moon; (32) The Heaven of Mercury; (33) TheHeaven of Venus; (34) The Heaven of the Sun; (35) The Heaven of Mars; (36) TheHeaven of Jupiter; (37) The Heaven of Saturn; (38) The Firmament; (39) ThePrimum Mobile; (40) The Empyrean Heaven.The fifth order of gates is termed The Angelic World and its divisions are asfollows: (41) Ishim—Sons of Fire; (42) Orphanim—Cherubim; (43) Aralim—Thrones;(44) Chashmalim—Dominions; (45) Seraphim—Virtues; (46) Melachim—Powers; (47)Elohim—Principalities; (48) Ben Elohim—Angels; (49) Cherubim—Archangels. [Theorder of the Angels is a matter of controversy, the arrangement above differingfrom that accepted in other sections of this volume. The Rabbins disagreefundamentally as to the proper sequence of the Angelic names.]The sixth order is termed The Archetype and consists of but one gate: (50) God,AIN SOPH, He whom no mortal eye hath seen. The fiftieth gate leads from creationinto the Creative Principle and he who passes through it returns into theunlimited and undifferentiated condition of ALL. The fifty gates reveal acertain evolutionary process and it was declared by the Rabbins that he whowould attain to the highest degree of understanding must pass sequentiallythrough all of these orders of life, each of which constituted a gate in thatthe spirit, passing from the lower to the higher, found in each more responsiveorganism new avenues of self-expression."},{"pageContent":"XXVII The Tree of the sephiroth The Tree of the Sephiroth may be considered an invaluable compendium of thesecret philosophy which originally was the spirit and soul of Chasidism. TheQabbalah is the priceless heritage of Israel, but each year those who comprehendits true principles become fewer in number. The Jew of today, if he lacks arealization of the profundity of his people’s doctrines, is usually permeatedwith that most dangerous form of ignorance, modernism, and is prone to regardthe Qabbalah either as an evil to be shunned like the plague or as a ridiculoussuperstition which has survived the black magic of the Dark Ages. Yet withoutthe key which the Qabbalah supplies, the spiritual mysteries of both the Old andthe New Testament must remain unsolved by Jew and Gentile alike.The Sephirothic Tree consists of ten globes of luminous splendor arranged inthree vertical columns and connected by 22 channels or paths. The ten globes arecalled the Sephiroth and to them are assigned the numbers 1 to 10. The threecolumns are called Mercy (on the right), Severity (on the left), and, betweenthem, Mildness, as the reconciling power. The columns may also be said torepresent Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, which form the triune support of theuniverse, for it is written that the foundation of all things is the Three. The22 channels are the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and to them are assigned themajor trumps of the Tarot deck of symbolic cards.Eliphas Levi declared that by arranging the Tarot cards according to a definiteorder man could discover all that is knowable concerning his God, his universe,and himself. When the ten numbers which pertain to the globes (Sephiroth) arecombined with the 22 letters relating to the channels, the resultant sum is32—the number peculiar to the Qabbalistic Paths of Wisdom. These Paths,occasionally referred to as the 32 teeth in the mouth of the Vast154 [images/00155.jpg] THE SEPHIROTHIC TREE OF THE LATER QABBALISTS.Having demonstrated that the Qabbalists divided the universe into four worlds,each consisting of ten spheres, it is necessary to consider next how the tenspheres of each world were arranged into what is called the “Sephirothic Tree.”This Tree is composed of ten circles, representing the numbers 1 to 10 andconnected together by twenty-two canals—the twenty-two letters of the Hebrewalphabet. The ten numbers plus the twenty-two letters result in the occultnumber 32, which, according to the Mishno, signifies the Thirty-two Paths ofWisdom. Letters and numbers, according to the Qabbalists, are the keys to allknowledge, for by a secret system of arranging them the mysteries of creationare revealed. For this reason they are called “the Paths of Wisdom.” This occultfact is carefully concealed in the 32nd degree of Freemasonry.There are four trees, one in each of the four worlds described in the precedingchapter. The first is in the Atziluthic World, the ten circles being the tenglobes of light established in the midst of AIN SOPH. The powers and attributesof this Tree are reflected into each of the three lower worlds, the form of theTree remaining the same but its power diminishing as it descends. To furthercomplicate their doctrine, the Qabbalists created another tree, which was acomposite of all four of the world trees but consisted of only ten globes. Inthis single tree were condensed all the arcana previously scattered through thevoluminous archives of Qabbalistic literature. Countenance or as the 32 nerves that branch out from the Divine Brain, areanalogous to the first 32 degrees of Freemasonry, which elevate the candidate tothe dignity of a Prince of the Royal Secret. Qabbalists also consider itextremely significant that in the original Hebrew Scriptures the name of Godshould occur 32 times in the first chapter of Genesis. (In the Englishtranslations of the Bible the name appears 33 times.) In the mystic analysis ofthe human body, according to the Rabbins, 32 spinal segments lead upward to theTemple of Wisdom—the skull.The four Qabbalistic Trees described in the preceding chapter were combined bylater Jewish scholars into one all-inclusive diagram and termed by them not onlythe Sephirothic but also the Archetypal, or Heavenly, Adam. According to someauthorities, it is this Heavenly Adam, and not a terrestrial man, whose creationis described in the opening chapters of Genesis. Out of the substances of thisdivine man the universe was formed; in him it remains and will continue evenafter dissolution shall resolve the spheres back into their own primitivesubstance. The Deity is never conceived of as actually contained in theSephiroth, which are purely hypothetical vessels employed to define the limitsof the Creative Essence. Adolph Franck rather likens the Sephiroth tovaricolored, transparent glass bowls filled with pure light, which apparentlyassumes the color of its containers but whose essential nature remains everunchanged and unchangeable.The ten Sephiroth composing the body of the prototypic Adam, the numbers relatedto them, and the parts of the universe to which they correspond are as follows:155 [images/00156.jpg] 156 [images/00157.jpg] It must continually be emphasized that the Sephiroth and the properties assignedto them, like the tetractys of the Pythagoreans, are merely symbols of thecosmic system with its multitude of parts. The truer and fuller meaning of theseemblems may not be revealed by writing or by word of mouth, but must be divinedas the result of study and meditation. In the Sepher ha Zohar it is written thatthere is a garment—the written doctrine—which every man may see. Those withunderstanding do not look upon the garment but at the body beneath it—theintellectual and philosophical code. The wisest of all, however, the servants ofthe Heavenly King, look at nothing save the soul—the spiritual doctrine—which isthe eternal and ever-springing root of the law. Of this great truth Eliphas Levialso writes declaring that none can gain entrance to the secret House of Wisdomunless he wear the voluminous cape of Apollonius of Tyana and carry in his handthe lamp of Hermes. The cape signifies the qualities of self-possession andself-reliance which must envelope the seeker as a cloak of strength, while theever- burning lamp of the sage represents the illumined mind and perfectlybalanced intellect without which the mystery of the ages can never be solved.The Sephirothic Tree is sometimes depicted as a human body, thus more definitelyestablishing the true identity of the first, or Heavenly, Man—Adam Kadmon—theIdea of the Universe. The ten divine globes (Sephiroth) are then considered asanalogous to the ten sacred members and organs of the Protogonos, according tothe following arrangement. Kether is the crown of the Prototypic Head andperhaps refers to the pineal gland; Chochmah and Binah are the right and lefthemispheres respectively of the Great Brain; Chesed and Geburah (Pechad) are theright and left arms respectively, signifying the active creative members of theGrand Man; Tiphereth is the heart, or, according to some, the entire viscera;Netsah and Hod are the right and left legs respectively, or the supports of theworld; Jesod is the generative system, or the foundation of form; and Malchuthrepresents the two feet, or the base of being. Occasionally Jesod is consideredas the male and Malchuth as the female generative power. The Grand Man thusconceived is the gigantic image of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, with head of gold,arms and chest of silver, body of brass, legs of iron, and feet of clay. Themediaeval Qabbalists also assigned one of the Ten Commandments and a tenth partof the Lord’s Prayer in sequential order to each of the ten Sephiroth.Concerning the emanations from Kether which establish themselves as three triadsof Creative Powers—termed in the Sepher ha Zohar three heads each with threefaces—H. P. Blavatsky writes: “This [Kether] was the first Sephiroth, containingin herself the other nine157 [images/00158.jpg]Sephiroth, or intelligences. Intheir totality and unity they represent the archetypal man, Adam Kadmon, theπρωτóγoνoς, who in his individuality or unity is yet dual, or bisexual, theGreek Didumos, for he is the prototype of all humanity. Thus we obtain threetrinities, each contained in a ‘head.’ In the first head, or face (thethree-faced Hindu Trimurti), we find Sephira [Kether], the first androgyne, atthe apex of the upper triangle, emitting Hachama [Chochmah], or Wisdom, amasculine and active potency—also called Jah,158 [images/00159.jpg]—and Binah,159 [images/00160.jpg]or Intelligence, a female and passive potency, alsorepresented by the name Jehovah160 [images/00161.jpg]These three form the firsttrinity or ‘face’ of the Sephiroth. This triad emanated Hesed, 161[images/00162.jpg]or Mercy, a masculine active potency, also called El, fromwhich emanated Geburah 162 [images/00163.jpg]or Justice, also called Eloha, afeminine passive potency; from the union of these two was produced Tiphereth 163[images/00164.jpg]Beauty, Clemency, the Spiritual Sun, known by the divine nameElohim; and the second triad, ‘face,’ or ‘head,’ was formed. These emanating, intheir turn, the masculine potency Netzah, n164 [images/00165.jpg]Firmness, orJehovah Sabaoth, who issued the feminine passive potency Hod, 165[images/00166.jpg]Splendor, or Elohim Sabaoth; the two produced Jesod, 166[images/00167.jpg]Foundation, who is the mighty living one El-Chai, thusyielding the third trinity or ‘head.’ The tenth Sephiroth is rather a duad, andis represented on the diagrams as the lowest circle. It is Malchuth orKingdom,167 [images/00168.jpg]and Shekinah168 [images/00169.jpg]also calledAdonai, and Cherubim among the angelic hosts. The first ‘Head’ is called theIntellectual world; the second ‘Head’ is the Sensuous, or the world ofPerception, and the third is the material or Physical world.” (See IsisUnveiled.)Among the later Qabbalists there is also a division of the Sephirothic Tree intofive parts, in which the distribution of the globes is according to thefollowing order:> 1. Macroprosophus, or the Great Face, is the term applied to Kether as the> first and most exalted of the Sephiroth and includes the nine potencies or> Sephiroth issuing from Kether.> 2. Abba, the Great Father, is the term generally applied to Chochmah—Universal> Wisdom—the first emanation of Kether, but, according to Ibn Gebirol, Chochmah> represents the Son, the Logos or the Word born from the union of Kether and> Binah.> 169 [images/00170.jpg]> > A TABLE OF SEPHIROTHIC CORRESPONDENCES.

The Bride of Microprosophus is the Malchuth—the epitome of the Sephiroth,> its quaternary constitution being composed of blendings of the four elements.> This is the divine Eve that is taken out of the side of Microprosophus and> combines the potencies of the entire Qabbalistic Tree in one sphere, which may> be termed man.According to the mysteries of the Sephiroth, the order of the Creation, or theDivine Lightning Flash which zigzags through the four worlds according to theorder of the divine emanations, is thus described: From AIN SOPH, the Nothingand All, the Eternal and Unconditioned Potency, issues Macroprosophus, the LongFace, of whom it is written, “Within His skull exist daily thirteen thousandmyriads of worlds which draw their existence from Him and by Him are upheld.”(See The Greater Holy Assembly.) Macroprosophus, the directionalized will of AINSOPH, corresponding to Kether, the Crown of the Sephiroth, gives birth out ofHimself to the nine lesser spheres of which He is the sum and the overbroodingcause. The 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, by the various combinations ofwhich the laws of the universe are established, constitute the scepter ofMacroprosophus which He wields from His flaming throne in the Atziluthic World.From this eternal and ancient androgyne—Kether—come forth Chochmah, the GreatFather, and Binah, the Great Mother. These two are usually referred to as Abbaand Aima respectively—the first male and the first female, the prototypes ofsex. These correspond to the first two letters of the sacred name, Jehovah,170[images/00171.jpg]IHVH. The Father is the171 [images/00172.jpg]or I, and theMother is the172 [images/00173.jpg]or H. Abba and Aima symbolize the creativeactivities of the universe, and are established in the creative world of Briah.In the Sepher ha Zohar it is written, “And therefore are all things establishedin the equality of male and female; for were it not so, how could they subsist?This beginning is the Father of all things; the Father of all Fathers; and bothare mutually bound together, and the one path shineth into the other—Chochmah,Wisdom, as the Father; Binah, Understanding, as the Mother.”There is a difference of opinion concerning certain of the relationships of theparts of the first triad. Some Qabbalists, including Ibn Gebirol, considerKether as the Father, Binah as the Mother, and Chochmah as the Son. In thislater arrangement, Wisdom, which is the attribute of the Son, becomes thecreator of the lower spheres. The symbol of Binah is the dove, a proper emblemfor the brooding maternal instinct of the Universal Mother.Because of the close similarity of their creative triad to the ChristianTrinity, the later Qabbalists rearranged the first three Sephiroth and added amysterious point called Daath—a hypothetical eleventh Sephira. This is locatedwhere the horizontal line connecting Chochmah and Binah crosses the verticalline joining Kether and Tiphereth. While Daath is not mentioned by the firstQabbalists, it is a highly important element and its addition to the SephirothicTree was not made without full realization of the significance of such action.If Chochmah be considered the active, intelligent energy of Kether, and Binahthe receptive capacity of Kether, then Daath becomes the thought which, createdby Chochmah, flows into Binah. The postulation of Daath clarifies the problem ofthe Creative Trinity, for here it is diagrammatically represented as consistingof Chochmah (the Father), Binah (the Mother, or Holy Ghost), and Daath, the Wordby which the worlds were established. Isaac Myer discounts the importance ofDaath, declaring it a subterfuge to conceal the fact that Kether, and notChochmah, is the true Father of the Creative Triad. He makes no attempt to givea satisfactory explanation for the symbolism of this hypothetical Sephira.According to the original conception, from the union of the Divine Father andthe Divine Mother is produced Microprosophus—the Short Face or the LesserCountenance, which is established in the Yetziratic World of formation andcorresponds to the letter173 [images/00174.jpg]or V, in the Great Name. The sixpowers of Microprosophus flow from and are contained in their own source, whichis Binah, the Mother of the Lesser Adam. These constitute the spheres of thesacred planets; their name is Elohim, and they move upon the face of the deep.The tenth Sephira—Malchuth, the Kingdom—is described as the Bride of the LesserAdam, created back to back with her lord, and to it is assigned the final H, orH, the last letter of the Sacred Name. The dwelling place of Malchuth is in thefourth world—Assiah—and it is composed of all the superior powers reflected intothe elements of the terrestrial sphere. Thus it will be seen that theQabbalistic Tree extends through four worlds, with its branches in matter andits roots in the Ancient of Ancients—Macroprosophus.Three vertical columns support the universal system as typified by theSephirothic Tree. The central pillar has its foundation in Kether, the EternalOne. It passes downward through the hypothetical Sephira, Daath, and thenthrough Tiphereth and Jesod, with its lower end resting upon the firm foundationof Malchuth, the last of the globes. The true import of the central pillar isequilibrium. It demonstrates how the Deity always manifests by emanating polesof expression from the midst of Itself but remaining free from the illusion ofpolarity. If the numbers of the four Sephiroth connected by this column be addedtogether (1 + 6 + 9 + 10), the sum is 26, the number of Jehovah. (See chapter onPythagorean Mathematics.)The column on the right, which is called Jachin, has its foundation on Chochmah,the outpouring Wisdom of God; the three globes suspended from it are allmasculine potencies. The column at the left is called Boaz. The three globesupon it are feminine and receptive potencies, for it is founded inUnderstanding, a receptive and maternal potency. Wisdom, it will be noted, isconsidered as radiant or outpouring, and Understanding as receptive, orsomething which is filled by the flowing of Wisdom. The three pillars areultimately united in Malchuth, in which all the powers of the superior worldsare manifested.The four globes upon the central column reveal the function of the creativepower in the various worlds. In the first world the creative power is Will—theone Divine Cause; in the second world, the hypothetical Daath—the Word comingforth from the Divine Thought; in the third world, Tiphereth—the Sun, or focalpoint between God and Nature; in the fourth world it is twofold, being thepositive and negative poles of the reproductive system, of which Jesod is themale and Malchuth the female.In Kircher’s Sephirothic Tree it should be especially noted that the ornamentsof the Tabernacle appear in the various parts of the diagram. These indicate adirect relationship between the sacred House of God and the universe—arelationship which must always be considered as existing between the Deitythrough whose activity the world is produced and the world itself, which must bethe house or vehicle of that Deity. Could the modern scientific world but sensethe true profundity of these philosophical deductions of the ancients, it wouldrealize that those who fabricated the structure of the Qabbalah possessed aknowledge of the celestial plan comparable in every respect with that of themodern savant.The Tetragrammaton, or the four-lettered Name of God, written thus174[images/00175.jpg]is pronounced Jehovah. The first letter is175[images/00176.jpg]Yod, the Germ, the Life, the Flame, the Cause, the One, andthe most fundamental of the Jewish phallic emblems. Its numerical value is 10,and it is to be considered as the 1 containing the 10. In the Qabbalah it isdeclared that the Yod is in reality three Yods, of which the first is thebeginning, the second is the center, and the third is the end. Its throne is theSephira Chochmah (according to Ibn Gebirol, Kether), from which it goes forth toimpregnate Binah, which is the first176 [images/00177.jpg]He. The result of thisunion is Tiphereth, which is the177 [images/00178.jpg]Vau, whose power is 6 andwhich symbolizes the six members of the Lesser Adam. The final178[images/00179.jpg]He, is Malchuth, the Inferior Mother, partaking in part of thepotencies of the Divine Mother, the first He. By placing the four letters of theTetragrammaton in a vertical column, a figure closely resembling the human bodyis produced, with Yod for the head, the first He for the arms and shoulders, Vaufor the trunk of the body, and the final He for the hips and legs. If the Hebrewletters be exchanged for their English equivalents, the form is not materiallychanged or the analogy altered. It is also extremely significant that byinserting the letter179 [images/00180.jpg]Shin, in the middle of the nameJehovah, the word Jehoshua, or Jesus, is formed thus:180 [images/00181.jpg] In the Qabbalistic Mysteries, according to Eliphas Levi, the name Jehovah isoccasionally written by connecting together 24 dots—the 24 powers before thethrone—and it is believed that the name of the Power of Evil is the sign ofJehovah reversed or inverted. (See Transcendental Magic.) Of the Great Word,Albert Pike writes: “The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealedand profound meaning of the Ineffable Name of Deity, communicated by God toMoses; and which meaning was long lost by the very precautions taken to concealit. The true pronunciation of that name was in truth a secret, in which,however, was involved the far more profound secret of its meaning. In thatmeaning is included all the truth that can be known by us, in regard to thenature of God.” (See Morals and Dogma.)"},{"pageContent":"XXVIII Dabbalistic Keys to the Creation of Man Henrie Stephen, in A World of Wonders, published in 1607, mentions a monk of St.Anthony who declared that while in Jerusalem the patriarch of that city hadshown him not only one of the ribs of the Word made flesh and some rays from theStar of Bethlehem, but also the snout of a seraph, a finger nail of a cherub,the horns of Moses, and a casket containing the breath of Christ! To a peoplebelieving implicitly in a seraph sufficiently tangible to have its proboscispreserved, the more profound issues of Judaistic philosophy must necessarily beincomprehensible. Nor is it difficult to imagine the reaction taking place inthe mind of some ancient sage should he hear that a cherub—which, according toSt. Augustine, signifies the Evangelists; according to Philo Judæus, theoutermost circumference of the entire heavens; and according to several of theChurch Fathers, the wisdom of God—had sprouted finger nails. The hopelessconfusion of divine principles with the allegorical figures created to representthem to the limited faculties of the uninitiated has resulted in the mostatrocious misconceptions of spiritual truths. Concepts well-nigh as preposterousas these, however, still stand as adamantine barriers to a true understanding ofOld and New Testament symbolism; for, until man disentangles his reasoningpowers from the web of venerated absurdities in which his mind has lain ensnaredfor centuries, how can Truth ever be discovered?The Old Testament—especially the Pentateuch—contains not only the traditionalaccount of the creation of the world and of man, but also, locked within it, thesecrets of the Egyptian initiators of Moses concerning the genesis of thegod-man (the initiate) and the mystery of his rebirth through philosophy. Whilethe Lawgiver of Israel is known to have compiled several works other than thosegenerally attributed to him, the writings now commonly circulated as thepurported sixth and seventh books of Moses are in reality spurious treatises onblack magic foisted on the credulous during the Middle Ages. Out of the hundredsof millions of pious and thoughtful students of Holy Writ, it is almostinconceivable that but a mere handful have sensed the sublimity of the esotericteachings of Sod (the Jewish Mysteries of Adonai). Yet familiarity with thethree Qabbalistical processes termed Gematria, Notarikon, and Temurah makespossible the discovery of many of the profoundest truths of ancient Jewishsuperphysics.181 [images/00182.jpg] THE VISION OF EZEKIEL.This plate, which is from the first Protestant Bible published in Spanish, showsthe Mercavah, or chariot of Jehovah, which appeared to Ezekiel by the riverChebar. The prophet beheld four strange creatures (E), each having four heads,four wings, and brazen hoofs like those of a calf. And there were four wheels(F) filled with eyes. Where the cherubim went the wheels went also. The spacebetween the cherubim and the wheels was filled with coals of fire. Upon the topof the chariot was a throne, upon which sat the likeness of a man (H). Ezekielfell upon his knees when he beheld the Mercavah surrounded by a whirlwind ofclouds and flames (A, B, C). A hand (K) reached out from the clouds and theprophet was ordered to eat of a scroll which the hand held forth.According to the mystics, the wheels supporting the throne of God represent theorbits of the planets, and the entire solar system is properly the Mercavah, orchariot of God. One of the divisions of the Qabbalah—that dealing wtih the artsand sciences of those planes which are under the heavens—is called the Mercavah.In the Zohar it is written that the celestial throne of Ezekiel’s visionsignifies the traditional law; the appearance of a man sitting upon the thronerepresents the written law. Philo Judæus in describing the cherubim upon the Arkof the Covenant declares that the figures are an intimation of the revolutionsof the whole heavens, one of the cherubim representing the outer circumferenceand the other the inner sphere. Facing each other, they represent the twohemispheres of the world. The flaming sword of the cherubim of Genesis is thecentral motion and agitation of the heavenly bodies. In all probability it alsorepresents the solar ray. By Germatria is meant not only the exchange of letters for their numericalequivalents but also the method of determining by an analysis of itsmeasurements the mystic purpose for which a building or other object wasconstructed. S. L. MacGregor-Mathers, in The Kabbalah Unveiled, gives thisexample of the application of Gematria: “Thus also the passage, Gen. xviii. 2VHNH SHLSHH, Vehenna Shalisha, ‘And lo, three men,’ equals in numerical valueALV MIKAL GBRIAL VRPAL, Elo Mikhael Gabriel Ve-Raphael, ‘These are Mikhael,Gabriel and Raphael;’ for each phrase=701.” Assuming the sides of a scalene tobe 11,9, and 6 inches, a triangle of such dimensions would then be anappropriate symbol of Jehovah, for the sum of its three sides would be 26, thenumerical value of the Hebrew word IHVH. Gematria also includes the system ofdiscovering the arcane meaning of a word by analyzing the size and arrangementof the strokes employed in the formation of its various letters. Gematria wasemployed by the Greeks as well as the Jews. The books of the NewTestament—particularly those attributed to St. John—contain many examples of itsuse. Nicephorus Callistus declared the Gospel according to St. John to have beendiscovered in a cavern under the Temple at Jerusalem, the volume having beensecreted “long anterior to the Christian æra.” The existence of interpolatedmaterial in the fourth Gospel substantiates the belief that the work wasoriginally written without any specific reference to the man Jesus, thestatements therein accredited to Him being originally mystical discoursesdelivered by the personification of the Universal Mind. The remaining Johanninewritings—the Epistles and the Apocalypse—are enshrouded by a similar veil ofmystery.By Notarikon each letter of a word may become the initial character of a newword. Thus from BRASHITH, first word in the book of Genesis, are extracted sixwords which mean that “in the beginning the Elohim saw that Israel would acceptthe law.” Mr. MacGregor-Mathers also gives six additional examples of Notarikonformed from the above word by Solomon Meir Ben Moses, a mediæval Qabbalist. Fromthe famous acrostic ascribed to the Ery- thræan Sibyl, St. Augustine derived theword IXΘΥΣ, which by Notarikon was expanded into the phrase, “Jesus Christ, Sonof God, Savior.” By another use of Notarikon, directly the reverse of the first,the initial, last, or middle letters of the words of a sentence may be joinedtogether to form a new word or words. For example, the name Amen, µν, may beextracted from182 [images/00183.jpg]“the Lord is the faithful King.” Becausethey had embodied these cryptic devices in their sacred writings, the ancientpriests admonished their disciples never to translate, edit, or rewrite thecontents of the sacred books.Under the general heading of Temurah several systems may be grouped andexplained in which various letters are substituted for other letters accordingto prearranged tables or certain mathematical arrangements of letters, regularor irregular. Thus the alphabet may be broken into two equal parts and writtenin horizontal lines so that the letters of the lower row can be exchanged forthose of the upper row, or vice versa. By this procedure the letters of the wordKuzu may be exchanged for those of IHVH, the Tetragrammaton. In another form ofTemurah the letters are merely rearranged.183 [images/00184.jpg]is the stonewhich is found in the center of the world, from which point the earth spread outon all sides. When broken in two the stone is184 [images/00185.jpg]which means“the placing of God.” (See Pekudei Rakov, 71, 72.) Again, Temurah may consist ofa simple anagram, as in the English word live, which reversed becomes evil. Thevarious systems of Temurah are among the most complicated and profound devicesof the ancient Rabbins.Among theological scholars there is a growing conviction that the hithertoaccepted translations of the Scriptural writings do not adequately express thespirit of the original documents.“After the first copy of the Book of God,” writes H. P. Blavatsky, “has beenedited and launched on the world by Hilkiah, this copy disappears, and Ezra hasto make a new Bible, which Judas Maccabeus finishes; * * * when it was copiedfrom the horned letters into square letters, it was corrupted beyondrecognition; * * * the Masorah completed the work of destruction; finally, wehave a text, not 900 years old, abounding with omissions, interpolations, andpremeditated perversions.” (See Isis Unveiled.)Prof. Crawford Howell Toy of Harvard notes: “Manuscripts were copied andrecopied by scribes who not only sometimes made errors in letters and words, butpermitted themselves to introduce new material into the text, or to combine inone manuscript, without mark of division, writings composed by different men;instances of these sorts of procedure are found especially in Micah andJeremiah, and the groups of prophecies which go under the names of Isaiah andZachariah.” (See Judaism and Christianity.)Does the mutilated condition of the Holy Bible—in part accidental—represent nonethe less a definite effort to confuse the uninitiated reader and thus betterconceal the secrets of the Jewish Tannaim? Never has the Christian world been inpossession of those hidden scrolls which contain the secret doctrine of Israel,and if the Qabbalists were correct in their assumption that the lost books ofthe Mosaic Mysteries have been woven into the fabric of the Torah, then theScriptures are veritably books within books. In rabbinical circles the opinionis prevalent that Christendom never has understood the Old Testament andprobably never will. In fact, the feeling exists—in some quarters, at least—thatthe Old Testament is the exclusive possession of the Jewish faith; also thatChristianity, after its unrelenting persecution of the Jew, takes unwarrantedliberties when it includes strictly Jewish writings in its sacred canon. But, asnoted by one rabbi, if Christianity must use the Jewish Scriptures, it should atleast strive to do so with some degree of intelligence!In the opening chapter of Genesis it is stated that after creating light andseparating it from darkness, the seven Elohim divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. Having thusestablished the inferior universe in perfect accord with the esoteric teachingsof the Hindu, Egyptian, and Greek Mysteries, the Elohim next turned theirattention to the production of flora and fauna and lastly man. “And God said,Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. * * * So God created man inhis own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created hethem. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply,and replenish the earth, * * *.”Consider in thoughtful silence the startling use of pronouns in the aboveextract from “the most perfect example of English literature.” When the pluraland androgynous Hebrew word Elohim was translated into the singular and sexlessword God, the opening chapters of Genesis were rendered comparativelymeaningless. It may have been feared that had the word been correctly translatedas “the male and female creative agencies,” the Christians would have beenjustly accused of worshiping a plurality of gods in the face of their repeatedclaims to monotheism! The plural form of the pronouns us and our revealsunmistakably, however, the pantheistic nature of Divinity. Further, theandrogynous constitution of the Elohim (God) is disclosed in the next verse,where he (referring to God) is said to have created man in his own image, maleand female; or, more properly, as the division of the sexes had not yet takenplace, male-female. This is a deathblow to the time-honored concept that God isa masculine potency as portrayed by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the SistineChapel. The Elohim then order these androgynous beings to be fruitful. Note thatneither the masculine nor the feminine principle as yet existed in a separatestate! And, lastly, note the word “replenish.” The prefix re denotes “back to anoriginal or former state or position,” or “repetition or restoration.” (SeeWebster’s International Dictionary, 1926.) This definite reference to a humanityexisting prior to the “creation of man” described in Genesis must be evident tothe most casual reader of Scripture.An examination of Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, and commentaries disclosesthe plural form of the word Elohim to be beyond the comprehension of theirrespected authors and editors. The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of ReligiousKnowledge thus sums up the controversy over the plural form of the word Elohim:“Does it now or did it originally signify plurality of divine being?” ADictionary of the Bible, edited by James Hastings, contains the followingconclusion, which echoes the sentiments of more critical etymologists of theBible: “The use of the plur. Elohim is also difficult to explain.” Dr. Havernickconsiders the plural form Elohim to signify the abundance and super-richnessexisting in the Divine Being. His statement, which appears in The Popular andCritical Bible Encyclopædia, is representative of the efforts made to circumventthis extremely damaging word. The International Standard Bible Dictionaryconsiders the explanations offered by modern theologians—of which Dr.Havernick’s is a fair example—to be too ingenious to have been conceived by theearly Hebrews and maintains that the word represents the survival of apolytheistic stage of Semitic thought. The Jewish Encyclopedia supports thelatter assumption with the following concise statement: “As far as epigraphicmaterial, traditions, and folk-lore throw light on the question, the Semites areshown to be of polytheistic leanings.”Various schools of philosophy, both Jewish and Gentile, have offeredexplanations erudite and otherwise of the identity of Adam. In this primordialman the Neo-Platonists recognized the Platonic Idea of humanity—the archetype orpattern of the genus homo. Philo Judæus considered Adam to represent the humanmind, which could understand (and hence give names to) the creatures about it,but could not comprehend (and hence left nameless) the mystery of its ownnature. Adam was also likened to the Pythagorean monad which by virtue of itsstate of perfect unity could dwell in the Edenic sphere. When through a processakin to fission the monad became the duad—the proper symbol of discord anddelusion—the creature thus formed was exiled from its celestial home. Thus thetwofold man was driven from the Paradise belonging to the undivided creation andcherubim and a flaming sword were placed on guard at the gates of the CausalWorld. Consequently, only after the reestablishment of unity within himself canman regain his primal spiritual state.According to the Isarim, the secret doctrine of Israel taught the existence offour Adams, each dwelling in one of the four Qabbalistic worlds. The first, orheavenly, Adam dwelt alone in the Atziluthic sphere and within his natureexisted all spiritual and material potentialities. The second Adam resided inthe sphere of Briah. Like the first Adam, this being was androgynous and thetenth division of its body (its heel, Malchuth) corresponded to the church ofIsrael that shall bruise the serpent’s head. The third Adam—likewiseandrogynous—was clothed in a body of light and abode in the sphere of Yetzirah.The fourth Adam was merely the third Adam after the fall into the sphere ofAssiah, at which time the spiritual man took upon himself the animal shell orcoat of skins. The fourth Adam was still considered as a single individual,though division had taken place within his nature and two shells or physicalbodies existed, in one of which was incarnated the masculine and in the otherthe feminine potency. (For further details consult Isaac Myer.)The universal nature of Adam is revealed in the various accounts concerning thesubstances of which he was formed. It was originally ordained that the “dirt” tobe used in fashioning him was to be derived from the seven worlds. As theseplanes, however, refused to give of their substances, the Creator wrenched fromthem by force the elements to be employed in the Adamic constitution. St.Augustine discovered a Notarikon in the name of Adam. He showed that the fourletters, A-D-A-M, are the first letters of the four words Anatole Dysis ArktosMesembria, the Greek names for the four corners of the world. The same authoralso sees in Adam a prototype of Christ, for he writes: “Adam sleeps that Evemay be formed: Christ dies, that the Church may be formed. While Adam sleeps,Eve is formed from his side. When Christ is dead, His side is smitten with aspear, that there flow forth sacraments to form the church. * * * Adam himselfwas the figure of Him that was to come.”In his recent work, Judaism, George Foote Moore thus describes the proportionsof the Adamic man: “He was a huge mass that filled the whole world to all thepoints of the compass. The dust of which his body was formed was gathered fromevery part of the world, or from the site of the future altar. Of greaterinterest is the notion that man was created androgynous, because it is probablya bit of foreign lore adapted to the first pair in Genesis. R. Samuel bar Nahman(third century), said, when God created Adam, He created him facing both ways(185 [images/00186.jpg]); then He sawed him in two and made two backs, one foreach figure.”The Zohar holds the concept of two Adams: the first a divine being who, steppingforth from the highest original darkness, created the second, or earthly, Adamin His own image. The higher, or celestial, man was the Causal sphere with itsdivine potencies and potentialities considered as a gigantic personality; itsmembers, according to the Gnostics, being the basic elements of existence. ThisAdam may have been symbolized as facing both ways to signify that with one faceit looked upon the proximate Cause for itself and with the other face lookedupon the vast sea of Cosmos into which it was to be immersed.Philosophically, Adam may be regarded as representative of the full spiritualnature of man—androgynous and not subject to decay. Of this fuller nature themortal man has little comprehension. Just as spirit contains matter withinitself and is both the source and ultimate of the state denominated matter, soEve represents the lower, or mortal, portion that is taken out of, or hastemporal existence in, the greater and fuller spiritual creation. Beingrepresentative of the inferior part of the individual, Eve is the temptress who,conspiring with the serpent of mortal knowledge, caused Adam to sink into atrancelike condition in which he was unconscious of his own higher Self. WhenAdam seemingly awoke, he actually sank into sleep, for he no longer was in thespirit but in the body; division having taken place within him, the true Adamrested in Paradise while his lesser part incarnated in a material organism (Eve)and wandered in the darkness of mortal existence.The followers of Mohammed apparently sensed more accurately than the uninitiatedof other sects the true mystic import of Paradise, for they realized that priorto his fall the dwelling place of man was not in a physical garden in anyparticular part of the earth but rather in a higher sphere (the angelic world)watered by four mystical streams of life. After his banishment from Paradise,Adam alighted on the Island of Ceylon, and this spot is sacred to certain Hindusects who recognize the old Island of Lanka—once presumably connected with themainland by a bridge—as the actual site of the Garden of Eden from which thehuman race migrated. According to the Arabian Nights (Sir Richard Burton’stranslation), Adam’s footprint may still be seen on the top of a Ceylonesemountain. In the Islamic legends, Adam was later reunited with his wife andafter his death his body was brought to Jerusalem subsequent to the Flood forburial by Melchizedek. (See the Koran.)The word ADM signifies a species or race and only for lack of properunderstanding has Adam been considered as an individual. As the Macrocosm, Adamis the gigantic Androgyne, even the Demiurgus; as the Microcosm, he is the chiefproduction of the Demiurgus and within the nature of the Microcosm the Demiurgusestablished all the qualities and powers which He Himself possessed. TheDemiurgus, however, did not possess immortality and, therefore, could not bestowit upon Adam. According to legend, the Demiurgus strove to keep man fromlearning the incompleteness of his Maker. The Adamic man consequently partook ofthe qualities and characteristics of the angels who were the ministers of theDemiurgus. It was affirmed by the Gnostic Christians that the redemption ofhumanity was assured through the descent of Nous (Universal Mind), who was agreat spiritual being superior to the Demiurgus and who, entering into theconstitution of man, conferred conscious immortality upon the Demiurgicfabrications.That phallic symbolism occupies an important place in early Jewish mysticism isindisputable. Hargrave Jennings sees in the figure of Adam a type of the lingamof Shiva, which was a stone representative of the creative power of the WorldGenerator. “In Gregorie’s works * * *,” writes Jennings, “is a passage to theeffect that ‘Noah daily prayed in the Ark before the Body of Adam,’ i.e., beforethe Phallus—Adam being the primitive Phallus, great procreator of the humanrace. ‘It may possibly seem strange,’ he says, ‘that this orison should be dailysaid before the body of Adam,’ but ‘it is a most confessed tradition among theeastern men that Adam was commanded by God that his dead body should be keptabove ground till a fullness of time should come to commit it186[images/00187.jpg]to the middle of the earth by a priest of the Most High God.’This means Mount Moriah, the Meru of India. ‘This body of Adam was embalmed andtransmitted from father to son, till at last it was delivered up by Lamech intothe hands of Noah.’ ” (See Phallicism.)This interpretation somewhat clarifies the Qabbalistic assertion that in thefirst Adam were contained all the souls of the Israelites. (See Sod.) Thoughaccording to the Aurea Legenda Adam was buried with the three seeds of the Treeof Knowledge in his mouth, it should be borne in mind that apparentlyconflicting myths were often woven around a single individual. One of theprofound mysteries of Qabbalism is that set forth in the Notarikon based uponthe letters of the name Adam (ADM). These three letters form the initials of thenames Adam, David, and the Messiah, and these three personalities were said tocontain one soul. As this soul represents the World Soul of humanity, Adamsignifies the involving soul, the Messiah the evolving soul, and David thatcondition of the soul termed epigenesis.In common with certain philosophic institutions of Asia, the Jewish Mysteriescontained a strange doctrine concerning the shadows of the Gods. Gazing downinto the Abyss, the Elohim beheld their own shadows and from these shadowspatterned the inferior creation. “In the dramatic representation of the creationof man in the Mysteries,” writes the anonymous Master of Balliol College, “theAleim [Elohim] were represented by men who, when sculpturing the form of anAdamite being, of a man, traced the outline of it on their own shadow, ormodelled it on their own shadow traced on the wall. This is how the art ofdrawing originated in Egypt, and the hieroglyphic figures carved on the Egyptianmonuments have so little relief that they still resemble a shadow.”In the ritualism of the early Jewish Mysteries the pageantry of creation wasenacted, the various actors impersonating the Creative Agencies. The red dirtfrom which the Adamic man was fashioned may signify fire, particularly sinceAdam is related to the Yod, or fire flame, which is the first letter of thesacred name Jehovah. In John ii. 20 it is written that the Temple was forty andsix years in the building, a statement in which St. Augustine sees a secret andsacred Gematria; for, according to the Greek philosophy of numbers, thenumerical value of the name Adam is 46. Adam thus becomes the type of theTemple, for the House of God—like primitive man—was a microcosm or epitome ofthe universe.In the Mysteries, Adam is accredited with having the peculiar power of spiritualgeneration. Instead of reproducing his kind by the physical generativeprocesses, he caused to issue from himself—or, more correctly, to be reflectedupon substance—a shadow of himself. This shadow he then ensouled and it became aliving creature. These shadows, however, remain only as long as the originalfigure of which they are the reflections endures, for with the removal of theoriginal the host of likenesses vanish with it. Herein is the key to theallegorical creation of Eve out of the side of Adam; for Adam, representative ofthe idea or pattern, is reflected into the material universe as a multitude ofensouled images which collectively are designated Eve. According to anothertheory, the division of the sexes took place in the archetypal sphere; hence theshadows in the lower world were divided into two classes consistent with theorders established in the Archetype. In the apparently incomprehensibleattraction of one sex for the other Plato recognized a cosmic urge towardreunion of the severed halves of this archetypal Being.Exactly what is to be inferred by the division of the sexes as symbolicallydescribed in Genesis is a much-debated question. That man was primarilyandrogynous is quite universally conceded and it is a reasonable presumptionthat he will ultimately regain this bisexual state. As to the manner in whichthis will be accomplished two opinions are advanced. One school of thoughtaffirms that the human soul was actually divided into two parts (male andfemale) and that man remains an unperfected creature until these parts arereunited through the emotion which man calls love. From this concept has grownthe much-abused doctrine of “soul mates” who must quest through the ages untilthe complementary part of each severed soul is discovered. The modern concept ofmarriage is to a certain degree founded upon this ideal.According to the other school, the so-called division of the sexes resulted fromsuppression of one pole of the androgynous being in order that the vitalenergies manifesting through it might be diverted to development of the rationalfaculties. From this point of view man is still actually androgynous andspiritually complete, but in the material world the feminine part of man’snature and the masculine part of woman’s nature are quiescent. Through spiritualunfoldment and knowledge imparted by the Mysteries, however, the latent elementin each nature is gradually brought into activity and ultimately the human beingthus regains sexual equilibrium. By this theory woman is elevated from theposition of being man’s errant part to one of complete equality. From this pointof view, marriage is regarded as a companionship in which two completeindividualities manifesting opposite polarities are brought into associationthat each may thereby awaken the qualities latent in the other and thus assistin the attainment of individual completeness. The first theory may be said toregard marriage as an end; the second as a means to an end. The deeper schoolsof philosophy have leaned toward the latter as more adequately acknowledging theinfinite potentialities of divine completeness in both aspects of creation.The Christian Church is fundamentally opposed to the theory of marriage,claiming that the highest degree of spirituality is achievable only by thosepreserving the virginal state. This concept seemingly originated among certainsects of the early Gnostic Christians, who taught that to propagate the humanspecies was to increase and perpetuate the power of the Demiurgus; for the lowerworld was looked upon as an evil fabrication created to ensnare the souls of allborn into it—hence it was a crime to assist in bringing souls to earth. When,therefore, the unfortunate father or mother shall stand before the FinalTribunal, all their offspring will also appear and accuse them of being thecause of those miseries attendant upon physical existence. This view isstrengthened by the allegory of Adam and Eve, whose sin through which humanityhas been brought low is universally admitted to have been concerned with themystery of generation. Mankind, owing to Father Adam its physical existence,regards its progenitor as the primary cause of its misery; and in the JudgmentDay, rising up as a mighty progeny, will accuse its common paternal ancestor.Those Gnostic sects maintaining a more rational attitude on the subject declaredthe very existence of the lower worlds to signify that the Supreme Creator had adefinite purpose in their creation; to doubt his judgment was, therefore, agrievous error. The church, however, seemingly arrogated to itself theastonishing prerogative of correcting God in this respect, for wherever possibleit continued to impose celibacy, a practice resulting in an alarming number ofneurotics. In the Mysteries, celibacy is reserved for those who have reached acertain degree of spiritual unfoldment. When advocated for the mass ofunenlightened humanity, however, it becomes a dangerous heresy, fatal alike toboth religion and philosophy. As Christendom in its fanaticism has blamed everyindividual Jew for the crucifixion of Jesus, so with equal consistency it hasmaligned every member of the feminine sex. In vindication of Eve philosophyclaims that the allegory signifies merely that man is tempted by his emotions todepart from the sure path of reason.Many of the early Church Fathers sought to establish a direct relationshipbetween Adam and Christ, thereby obviously discounting the extremely sinfulnature of man’s common ancestor, since it is quite certain that when St.Augustine likens Adam to Christ and Eve to the church he does not intend tobrand the latter institution as the direct cause of the fall of man. For someinexplicable reason, however, religion has ever regarded intellectualism—in factevery form of knowledge—as fatal to man’s spiritual growth. The IgnorantineFriars are an outstanding example of this attitude.In this ritualistic drama—possibly derived from the Egyptians—Adam, banishedfrom the Garden of Eden, represents man philosophically exiled from the sphereof Truth. Through ignorance man falls; through wisdom he redeems himself. TheGarden of Eden represents the House of the Mysteries (see The Vision of Enoch)in the midst of which grew both the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledgeof Good and Evil.Man, the banished Adam, seeks to pass from the outer court of the Sanctuary (theexterior universe) into the sanctum sanctorum, but before him rises a vastcreature armed with a flashing sword that, moving slowly but continually, sweepsclear a wide circle, and through this “Ring Pass Not” the Adamic man cannotbreak.The cherubim address the seeker thus: “Man, thou art dust and to dust thou shaltreturn. Thou wert fashioned by the Builder of Forms; thou belongest to thesphere of form, and the breath that was breathed into thy soul was the breath ofform and like a flame it shall flicker out. More than thou art thou canst notbe. Thou art a denizen of the outer world and it is forbidden thee to enter thisinner place.”And the Adam replies: “Many times have I stood within this courtyard and beggedadmission to my Father’s house and thou hast refused it me and sent me back towander in darkness. True it is that I was fashioned out of the dirt and that myMaker could not confer upon me the boon of immortality. But no more shalt thousend me away; for, wandering in the darkness, I have discovered that theAlmighty hath decreed my salvation because He hath sent out of the most hiddenMystery His Only Begotten who didst take upon Himself the world fashioned by theDemiurgus. Upon the elements of that world was He crucified and from Him hathpoured forth the blood of my salvation. And God, entering into His creation,hath quickened it and established therein a road that leadeth to Himself. Whilemy Maker could not give me immortality, immortality was inherent in the verydust of which I was composed, for before the world was fabricated and before theDemiurgus became the Regent of Nature the Eternal Life had impressed itself uponthe face of Cosmos. This is its sign—the Cross. Do you now deny me entrance, Iwho have at last learned the mystery of myself?”And the voice replies: “He who is aware, IS! Behold!”Gazing about him, Adam finds himself in a radiant place, in the midst of whichstands a tree with flashing jewels for fruit and entwined about its trunk aflaming, winged serpent crowned with a diadem of stars. It was the voice of theserpent that had spoken.“Who art thou?” demands the Adam.“I,” the serpent answers, “am Satan who was stoned; I am the Adversary—the Lordwho is against you, the one who pleads for your destruction before the EternalTribunal. I was your enemy upon the day that you were formed; I have led youinto temptation; I have delivered you into the hands of evil; I have malignedyou; I have striven ever to achieve your undoing. I am the guardian of the Treeof Knowledge and I have sworn that none whom I can lead astray shall partake ofits fruits.”The Adam replies: “For uncounted ages have I been thy servant. In my ignorance Ilistened to thy words and they led me into paths of sorrow. Thou hast placed inmy mind dreams of power, and when I struggled to realize those dreams theybrought me naught but pain. Thou hast sowed in me the seeds of desire, and whenI lusted after the things of the flesh agony was my only recompense. Thou hastsent me false prophets and false reasoning, and when I strove to grasp themagnitude of Truth I found thy laws were false and only dismay rewarded mystrivings. I am done with thee forever, O artful Spirit! I have tired of thyworld of illusions. No longer will I labor in thy vineyards of iniquity. Getthee behind me, tempter, and the host of thy temptations. There is no happiness,no peace, no good, no future in the doctrines of selfishness, hate, and passionpreached by thee. All these things do I cast aside. Renounced is thy ruleforever!”And the serpent makes answer: “Behold, O Adam, the nature of thy Adversary!” Theserpent disappears in a blinding sunburst of radiance and in its place stands anangel resplendent in shining, golden garments with great scarlet wings thatspread from one corner of the heavens to the other. Dismayed and awestruck, theAdam falls before the divine creature.“I am the Lord who is against thee and thus accomplishes thy salvation,”continues the voice. “Thou hast hated me, but through the ages yet to be thoushalt bless me, for I have led thee out of the sphere of the Demiurgus; I haveturned thee against the illusion of worldliness; I have weaned thee of desire; Ihave awakened in thy soul the immortality of which I myself partake. Follow me,O Adam, for I am the Way, the Life, and the Truth!”"},{"pageContent":"XXIX An Analysis of the Tarot Cards Opinions of authorities differ widely concerning the origin of playing cards,the purpose for which they were intended, and the time of their introductioninto Europe. In his Researches into the History of Playing Cards, Samuel WellerSinger advances the opinion that cards reached Southern Europe from India by wayof Arabia. It is probable that the Tarot cards were part of the magical andphilosophical lore secured by the Knights Templars from the Saracens or one ofthe mystical sects then flourishing in Syria. Returning to Europe, the Templars,to avoid persecution, concealed the arcane meaning of the symbols by introducingthe leaves of their magical book ostensibly as a device for amusement andgambling. In support of this contention, Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer states:“That cards were brought by the home-returning warriors, who imported many ofthe newly acquired customs and habits of the Orient to their own countries,seems to be a well-established fact; and it does not contradict the statementmade by some writers who declared that the gypsies—who about that time began towander over Europe—brought with them and introduced cards, which they used, asthey do at the present day, for divining the future.” (See The Devil’s PictureBooks.)Through the Gypsies the Tarot cards may be traced back to the religioussymbolism of the ancient Egyptians. In his remarkable work, The Gypsies, SamuelRoberts presents ample proof of their Egyptian origin. In one place he writes:“When Gypsies originally arrived in England is very uncertain. They are firstnoticed in our laws, by several statutes against them in the reign of HenryVIII, in which they are described as ‘an outlandish people, calling themselvesEgyptians; who do not profess any craft or trade, but go about in great numbers,* * *.“’ A curious legend relates that after the destruction of the Serapeum inAlexandria, the large body of attendant priests banded themselves together topreserve the secrets of the rites of Serapis. Their descendants (Gypsies)carrying with them the most precious of the volumes saved from the burninglibrary—the Book of Enoch, or Thoth (the Tarot)—became wanderers upon the faceof the earth, remaining a people apart with an ancient language and a birthrightof magic and mystery.187 [images/00188.jpg] EARLY PORTUGUESE CARDS.In writing of the deck from which the four cavaliers (jacks) here reproducedwere taken, William Andrew Chatto notes: “Some of the specimens of Portuguesecards given in the ‘Jeux de Cartes Tarots et de Cartes Numérales’ have very muchthe appearance of having been originally suggested by, if not copied from, anOriental type; more especially in the suits of Danari and Bastoni,—Money andClubs. In those cards the circular figure, generally understood as representingDanari, or Money, is certainly much more like the Chakra, or quoit of Vichnou[Vishnu], as seen in Hindostanee drawings, than a piece of coin; while on thetop of the Club there is a diamond proper, which is another of the attributes ofthe same deity.” Also worthy of note are the Rosicrucian and Masonic emblemsappearing on various mediæval decks. As the secrets of these organizations wereoften concealed in cryptic engravings, it is very probable that the enigmaticdiagrams upon various decks of cards were used both to conceal and to perpetuatethe political and philosophical arcana of these orders. The frontispiece of Mr.Chatto’s book shows a knave of hearts bearing a shield emblazoned with a crownedRosicrucian rose. Count de Gébelin believed the word Tarot itself to be derived from two Egyptianwords, Tar, meaning “road,” and Ro, meaning “royal.” Thus the Tarot constitutesthe royal road to wisdom. (See Le Monde Primitif.) In his History of Magic, P.Christian, the mouthpiece of a certain French secret society, presents afantastic account of a purported initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries whereinthe 22 major Tarots assume the proportions of trestleboards of immense size andline a great gallery. Stopping before each card in turn, the initiator describedits symbolism to the candidate. Edouard Schuré, whose source of information wassimilar to that of Christian’s, hints at the same ceremony in his chapter oninitiation into the Hermetic Mysteries. (See The Great Initiates.) While theEgyptians may well have employed the Tarot cards in their rituals, these Frenchmystics present no evidence other than their own assertions to support thistheory. The validity also of the so-called Egyptian Tarots now in circulationhas never been satisfactorily established. The drawings are not only quitemodern but the symbolism itself savors of French rather than Egyptian influence.The Tarot is undoubtedly a vital element in Rosicrucian symbolism, possibly thevery book of universal knowledge which the members of the order claimed topossess. The Rota Mundi is a term frequently occurring in the early manifestoesof the Fraternity of the Rose Cross. The word Rota by a rearrangement of itsletters becomes Taro, the ancient name of these mysterious cards. W.F.C. Wigstonhas discovered evidence that Sir Francis Bacon employed the Tarot symbolism inhis ciphers. The numbers 21, 56, and 78, which are all directly related to thedivisions of the Tarot deck, are frequently involved in Bacon’s cryptograms. Inthe great Shakespearian Folio of 1623 the Christian name of Lord Bacon appears21 times on page 56 of the Histories. (See The Columbus of Literature.)Many symbols appearing upon the Tarot cards have definite Masonic interest. ThePythagorean numerologist will also find an important relationship to existbetween the numbers on the cards and the designs accompanying the numbers. TheQabbalist will be immediately impressed by the significant sequence of thecards, and the alchemist will discover certain emblems meaningless save to oneversed in the divine chemistry of transmutation and regeneration. As the Greeksplaced the letters of their alphabet—with their corresponding numbers—upon thevarious parts of the body of their humanly represented Logos, so the Tarot cardshave an analogy not only in the parts and members of the universe but also inthe divisions of the human body. They are in fact the key to the magicalconstitution of man.The Tarot cards must be considered (1) as separate and complete hieroglyphs,each representing a distinct principle, law, power, or element in Nature; (2) inrelation to each other as the effect of one agent operating upon another; and(3) as vowels and consonants of a philosophic alphabet. The laws governing allphenomena are represented by the symbols upon the Tarot cards, whose numericalvalues are equal to the numerical equivalents of the phenomena. As everystructure consists of certain elemental parts, so the Tarot cards represent thecomponents of the structure of philosophy. Irrespective of the science orphilosophy with which the student is working, the Tarot cards can be identifiedwith the essential constituents of his subject, each card thus being related toa specific part according to mathematical and philosophical laws. “An imprisonedperson,” writes Eliphas Levi, “with no other book than the Tarot, if he knew howto use it, could in a few years acquire universal knowledge, and would be ableto speak on all subjects with unequalled learning and inexhaustible eloquence.”(See Transcendental Magic.)The diverse opinions of eminent authorities on the Tarot symbolism are quiteirreconcilable. The conclusions of the scholarly Court de Gébelin and thebizarre Grand Etteila—the first authorities on the subject—not only are atradical variance but both are equally discredited by Levi, whose arrangement ofthe Tarot trumps was rejected in turn by Arthur Edward Waite and Paul Case asbeing an effort to mislead students. The followers of Levi—especially Papus,Christian, Westcott, and Schure—are regarded by the “reformed Tarotists” ashonest but benighted individuals who wandered in darkness for lack of PamelaColeman Smith’s new deck of Tarot cards with revisions by Mr. Waite.Most writers on the Tarot (Mr. Waite a notable exception) have proceeded uponthe hypothesis that the 22 major trumps represent the letters of the Hebrewalphabet. This supposition is based upon nothing more substantial than thecoincidence that both consist of 22 parts. That Postel, St. Martin, and Levi allwrote books divided into sections corresponding to the major Tarots is aninteresting sidelight on the subject. The major trump cards portray incidentsfrom the Book of Revelation; and the Apocalypse of St. John is also divided into22 chapters. Assuming the Qabbalah to hold the solution to the Tarot riddle,seekers have often ignored other possible lines of research. The task, however,of discovering the proper relationship sustained by the Tarot trumps to theletters of the Hebrew alphabet and the Paths of Wisdom thus far has not met withany great measure of success. The major trumps of the Tarot and the 22 lettersof the Hebrew alphabet cannot be synchronized without first fixing the correctplace of the unnumbered, or zero, card—Le Mat, the Fool. Levi places this cardbetween the 20th and 21st Tarots, assigning to it the Hebrew letter Shin188[images/00189.jpg]The same order is followed by Papus, Christian, and Waite, thelast, however, declaring this arrangement to be incorrect. Westcott makes thezero card the 22nd of the Tarot major trumps. On the other hand, both Court deGébelin and Paul Case place the unnumbered card before the first numbered cardof the major trumps, for if the natural order of the numbers (according toeither the Pythagorean or Qabbalistic system) be adhered to, the zero card mustnaturally precede the number 1.This does not dispose of the problem, however, for efforts to assign a Hebrewletter to each Tarot trump in sequence produce an effect far from convincing.Mr. Waite, who reedited the Tarot, expresses himself thus: “I am not to beincluded among those who are satisfied that there is a valid correspondencebetween Hebrew letters and Tarot Trump symbols.” (See introduction to The Bookof Formation by Knut Stenring.) The real explanation may be that the majorTarots no longer are in the same sequence as when they formed the leaves ofHermes’ sacred book, for the Egyptians—or even their Arabian successors—couldhave purposely confused the cards so that their secrets might be betterpreserved. Mr. Case has developed a system, which, while superior to most,depends largely upon two debatable points, namely, the accuracy of Mr. Waite’srevised Tarot and the justification for assigning the first letter of the Hebrewalphabet to the unnumbered, or zero, card. Since Aleph (the first Hebrew letter)has the numerical value of 1, its assignment to the zero card is equivalent tothe statement that zero is equal to the letter Aleph and therefore synonymouswith the number 1.With rare insight, Court de Gébelin assigned the zero card to AIN SOPH, theUnknowable First Cause. As the central panel of the Bembine Table represents theCreative Power surrounded by seven triads of manifesting divinities, so may thezero card represent that Eternal Power of which the 21 surrounding ormanifesting aspects are but limited expressions. If the 21 major trumps beconsidered as limited forms existing in the abstract substance of the zero card,it then becomes their common denominator. Which letter, then, of the Hebrewalphabet is the origin of all the remaining letters? The answer is apparent:Yod. In the presence of so many speculations, one more may not offend. The zerocard—Le Mat, the Fool—has been likened to the material universe because themortal sphere is the world of unreality. The lower universe, like the mortalbody of man, is but a garment, a motley costume, well likened to cap and bells.Beneath the garments of the fool is the divine substance, however, of which thejester is but a shadow; this world is a Mardi Gras—a pageantry of divine sparksmasked in the garb of fools. Was not this zero card (the Fool) placed in theTarot deck to deceive all who could not pierce the veil of Illusion?The Tarot cards were entrusted by the illumined hierophants of the Mysteriesinto the keeping of the foolish and the ignorant, thus becoming play-things—inmany instances even instruments of vice. Man’s evil habits therefore actuallybecame the unconscious perpetrators of his philosophical precepts. “We mustadmire the wisdom of the Initiates,” writes Papus, “who utilized vice and madeit produce more beneficial results than virtue.” Does not this act of theancient priests itself afford proof that the entire mystery of the Tarot iswrapped up in the symbolism of its zero card? If knowledge was thus entrusted tofools, should it not be sought for in this card?If Le Mat be placed before the first card of the Tarot deck and the others laidout in a horizontal line in sequence from left to right, it will be found thatthe Fool is walking toward the other trumps as though about to pass through thevarious cards. Like the spiritually hoodwinked and bound neophyte, Le Mat isabout to enter upon the supreme adventure—that of passage through the gates ofthe Divine Wisdom. If the zero card be considered as extraneous to the majortrumps, this destroys the numerical analogy between these cards and the Hebrewletters by leaving one letter without a Tarot correspondent. In this event itwill be necessary to assign the missing letter to a hypothetical Tarot cardcalled the elements, assumed to have been broken up to form the 56 cards of theminor trumps. It is possible that each of the major trumps may be subject to asimilar division.The first numbered major trump is called Le Bateleur, the Juggler, and accordingto Court de Géblein, indicates the entire fabric of creation to be but a dream,existence a juggling of divine elements, and life a perpetual game of hazard.The seeming miracles of Nature are but feats of cosmic legerdemain. Man is likethe little ball in the hands of the juggler, who waves his wand and, presto! theball vanishes. The world looking on does not realize that the vanished articleis still cleverly concealed by the juggler in the hollow of his hand. This isalso the Adept whom Omar Khayyam calls “the master of the show.” His message isthat the wise direct the phenomena of Nature and are never deceived thereby.The magician stands behind a table on which are spread out a number of objects,prominent among them a cup—the Holy Grail and the cup placed by Joseph inBenjamin’s sack; a coin—the tribute money and the wages of a Master Builder; anda sword—that of Goliath and also the mystic blade of the philosopher whichdivides the false from the true. The magician’s hat is in the form of the cosmiclemniscate, signifying the first motion of creation. His right hand points tothe earth; his left holds aloft the wand symbolic of his mastership over theterrestrial universe—the objects on the table. The wand is the rod of Jacob andalso the staff that budded—the human spine crowned with the globe of creativeintelligence. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the magician wears a uræus or goldenband about his forehead, the table before him is in the form of a perfect cube,and his girdle is the serpent of eternity devouring its own tail.The second numbered major trump is called La Papesse, the Female Pope, and hasbeen associated with a curious legend of the only woman who ever sat in thepontifical chair. Pope Joan is supposed to have accomplished this bymasquerading in male attire, and was stoned to death when her subterfuge wasdiscovered. This card portrays a seated woman crowned with a tiara surmounted bya lunar crescent. In her lap is the Tora, or book of the Law (usually partlyclosed), and in her left hand are the keys to the secret doctrine, one gold andthe other silver. Behind her rise two pillars (Jachin and Boaz) with amulticolored veil stretched between. Her throne stands upon a checkerboardfloor. A figure called Juno is occasionally substituted for La Papesse. Like thefemale hierophant of the Mysteries of Cybele, this symbolic figure personifiesthe Shekinah, or Divine Wisdom. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the priestess isveiled, a reminder that the full countenance of truth is not revealed touninitiated man. A veil also covers one-half of her book, thus intimating thatbut one-half of the mystery of being can be comprehended.The third numbered major trump is called L‘Impératrice, the Empress, and hasbeen likened to the “woman clothed with the sun” described in the Apocalypse. Onthis card appears the winged figure of a woman seated upon a throne, supportingwith her right hand a shield emblazoned with a phœnix and holding in her left ascepter surmounted by an orb or trifoliate flower. Beneath her left foot issometimes shown the crescent. Either the Empress is crowned or her head issurrounded by a diadem of stars; sometimes both. She is called Generation, andrepresents the threefold spiritual world out of which proceeds the fourfoldmaterial world. To the graduate of the College of the Mysteries she is the AlmaMater out of whose body the initiate has been “born again.” In thepseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Empress is shown seated upon a cube filled with eyesand a bird is balanced upon the forefinger of her left hand. The upper part ofher body is surrounded by a radiant golden nimbus. Being emblematic of the powerfrom which emanates the entire tangible universe, L’Impératrice is frequentlysymbolized as pregnant.The fourth numbered major trump is called L’Empereur, the Emperor, and by itsnumerical value is directly associated with the great Deity revered by thePythagoreans under the form of the tetrad. His symbols declare the Emperor to bethe Demiurgus, the Great King of the inferior world. The Emperor is dressed inarmor and his throne is a cube stone, upon which a phœnix is also clearlyvisible. The king has his legs crossed in a most significant manner and carrieseither a scepter surmounted by an orb or a scepter in his right hand and an orbin his left. The orb itself is evidence that he is supreme ruler of the world.Upon his right and left breasts respectively appear the symbols of the sun andmoon, which in symbolism are referred to as the eyes of the Great King. Theposition of the body and legs forms the symbol of sulphur, the sign of theancient alchemical monarch. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the figure is inprofile. He wears a Masonic apron and the skirt forms a right-angled triangle.Upon his head is the Crown of the North and his forehead is adorned with thecoiled urœus.The fifth numbered major trump is called Le Pape, the Pope, and represents thehigh priest of a pagan or Christian Mystery school. In this card the hierophantwears the tiara and carries in his left hand the triple cross surmounting theglobe of the world. His right hand, bearing upon its back the stigmata, makes“the ecclesiastic sign of esotericism,” and before him kneel two suppliants oracolytes. The back of the papal throne is in the form of a celestial and aterrestrial column. This card signifies the initiate or master of the mystery oflife and, according to the Pythagoreans, the spiritual physician. Theillusionary universe in the form of two figures (polarity) kneels before thethrone upon which sits the initiate who has elevated his consciousness to theplane of spiritual understanding and reality. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot theMaster wears the urœus. A white and a black figure—life and death, light anddarkness, good and evil—kneel before him. The initiate’s mastery over unrealityis indicated by the tiara and the triple cross, emblems of rulership over thethree worlds which have issued from the Unknowable First Cause.The sixth numbered major trump is called L’Amoureux, the Lovers. There are twodistinct forms of this Tarot. One shows a marriage ceremony in which a priest isuniting a youth and a maiden (Adam and Eve?) in holy wedlock. Sometimes a wingedfigure above transfixes the lovers with his dart. The second form of the cardportrays a youth with a female figure on either side. One of these figures wearsa golden crown and is winged, while the other is attired in the flowing robes ofthe bacchante and on her head is a wreath of vine leaves. The maidens representthe twofold soul of man (spiritual and animal), the first his guardian angel andthe second his ever-present demon. The youth stands at the beginning of maturelife, “the Parting of the Ways,” where he must choose between virtue and vice,the eternal and the temporal. Above, in a halo of light, is the genius of Fate(his star), mistaken for Cupid by the uninformed. If youth chooses unwisely, thearrow of blindfolded Fate will transfix him. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot thearrow of the genius points directly to the figure of vice, thereby signifyingthat the end of her path is destruction. This card reminds man that the price offree will—or, more correctly, the power of choice—is responsibility.The seventh numbered major trump is called Le Chariot, the Chariot, and portraysa victorious warrior crowned and riding in a chariot drawn by black and whitesphinxes or horses. The starry canopy of the chariot is upheld by four columns.This card signifies the Exalted One who rides in the chariot of creation. Thevehicle of the solar energy being numbered seven reveals the arcane truth thatthe seven planets are the chariots of the solar power which rides victorious intheir midst. The four columns supporting the canopy represent the four MightyOnes who uphold the worlds represented by the star-strewn drapery. The figurecarries the scepter of the solar energy and its shoulders are ornamented withlunar crescents—the Urim and Thummim. The sphinxes drawing the chariot representthe secret and unknown power by which the victorious ruler is moved continuouslythrough the various parts of his universe. In certain Tarot decks the victorsignifies the regenerated man, for the body of the chariot is a cubic stone. Theman in armor is not standing in the chariot but is rising out of the cube, thustypifying the ascension of the 3 out of the 4—the turning upward of the flap ofthe Master Mason’s apron. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the warrior carries thecurved sword of Luna, is bearded to signify maturity, and wears the collar ofthe planetary orbits. His scepter (emblematic of the threefold universe) iscrowned with a square upon which is a circle surmounted by a triangle.189 [images/00190.jpg] A CARD FROM THE MANTEGNA PACK.Among the more curious examples of playing cards are those of the Mantegna deck.In 1820, a perfect deck of fifty cards brought the then amazing price of eightypounds. The fifty subjects composing the Mantegna deck, each of which isrepresented by an appropriate figure, are: (1) A beggar; (2) A page; (3) Agoldsmith; (4) A merchant: (5) A gentleman; (6) A knight; (7) The Doge; (8) Aking; (9) An emperor: (10) The Pope; (11) Calliope; (12) Urania; (13)Terpsichore; (14) Erato; (15) Polyhymnia; (16) Thalia; (17) Melpomene; (18)Euterpe; (19) Clio; (20) Apollo; (21) Grammar; (22) Logic; (23) Rhetoric; (24)Geometry; (25) Arithmetic; (26) Music; (27) Poetry; (28) Philosophy; (29)Astrology; (30) Theology; (31) Astronomy; (32) Chronology; (33) Cosmogony; (34)Temperance; (35) Prudence; (36) Fortitude; (37) Justice; (38) Charity; (39)Hope; (40) Faith; (41) the Moon; (42) Mercury; (43) Venus; (44) the Sun; (45)Mars; (46) Jupiter; (47) Saturn; (48) the eighth Sphere; (49) the Primum Mobile;(50) the First Cause. The Qabbalistic significance of these cards is apparent,and it is possible that they have a direct analogy to the fifty gates of lightreferred to in Qabbalistic writings. The eighth numbered major trump is called La Justice, Justice, and portrays aseated figure upon a throne, the back of which rises in the form of two columns.Justice is crowned and carries in her right hand a sword and in her left a pairof scales. This card is a reminder of the judgment of the soul in the hall ofOsiris. It teaches that only balanced forces can endure and that eternal Justicedestroys with the sword that which is unbalanced. Sometimes Justice is depictedwith a braid of her own hair twisted around her neck in a manner resembling ahangman’s knot. This may subtly imply that man is the cause of his own undoing,his actions (symbolized by his hair) being the instrument of his annihilation.In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the figure of Justice is raised upon a dais ofthree steps, for Justice can be fully administered only by such as have beenelevated to the third degree. Justice is blindfolded, that the visible shall inno way influence its decision. (For reasons he considers beyond his readers’intelligence, Mr. Waite reversed the eighth and eleventh major trumps.)The ninth numbered major trump is called L’Hermite, the Hermit, and portrays anaged man, robed in a monkish habit and cowl, leaning upon a staff. This card waspopularly supposed to represent Diogenes in his quest for an honest man. In hisright hand the recluse carries a lamp which he partly conceals within the foldsof his cape. The hermit thereby personifies the secret organizations which foruncounted centuries have carefully concealed the light of the Ancient Wisdomfrom the profane. The staff of the hermit is knowledge, which is man’s main andonly enduring support. Sometimes the mystic rod is divided by knobs into sevensections, a subtle reference to the mystery of the seven sacred centers alongthe human spine. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the hermit shields the lamp behinda rectangular cape to emphasize the philosophic truth that wisdom, if exposed tothe fury of ignorance, would be destroyed like the tiny flame of a lampunprotected from the storm. Man’s bodies form a cloak through which his divinenature is faintly visible like the flame of the partly covered lantern. Throughrenunciation—the Hermetic life—man attains depth of character and tranquillityof spirit.The tenth numbered major trump is called La Roue de Fortune, the Wheel ofFortune, and portrays a mysterious wheel with eight spokes—the familiar Buddhistsymbol of the Cycle of Necessity. To its rim cling Anubis and Typhon—theprinciples of good and evil. Above sits the immobile sphinx, carrying the swordof Justice and signifying the perfect equilibrium of Universal Wisdom. Anubis isshown rising and Typhon descending; but when Typhon reaches the bottom, evilascends again, and when Anubis reaches the top good wanes once more. The Wheelof Fortune represents the lower universe as a whole with Divine Wisdom (thesphinx) as the eternal arbiter between good and evil. In India, the chakra, orwheel, is associated with the life centers either of a world or of anindividual. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the sphinx is armed with a javelin, andTyphon is being thrown from the wheel. The vertical columns, supporting thewheel and so placed that but one is visible, represent the axis of the worldwith the inscrutable sphinx upon its northern pole. Sometimes the wheel with itssupports is in a boat upon the water. The water is the Ocean of Illusion, whichis the sole foundation of the Cycle of Necessity.The eleventh numbered major trump is called La Force, Strength, and portrays agirl wearing a hat in the form of a lemniscate, with her hands upon the mouth ofan apparently ferocious lion. Considerable controversy exists as to whether themaid is closing or opening the lion’s mouth. Most writers declare her to beclosing the jaws of the beast, but a critical inspection conveys the oppositeimpression. The young woman symbolizes spiritual strength and the lion eitherthe animal world which the girl is mastering or the Secret Wisdom over which sheis mistress. The lion also signifies the summer solstice and the girl, Virgo,for when the sun enters this constellation, the Virgin robs the lion of hisstrength. King Solomon’s throne was ornamented with lions and he himself waslikened to the king of beasts with the key of wisdom between its teeth. In thissense, the girl may be opening the lion’s mouth to find the key containedtherein, for courage is a prerequisite to the attainment of knowledge. In thepseudo-Egyptian Tarot the symbolism is the same except that the maiden isrepresented as a priestess wearing an elaborate crown in the form of a birdsurmounted by serpents and an ibis.The twelfth numbered major trump is called Le Pendu, the Hanged Man, andportrays a young man hanging by his left leg from a horizontal beam, the lattersupported by two tree trunks from each of which six branches have been removed.The right leg of the youth is crossed in back of the left and his arms arefolded behind his back in such a way as to form a cross surmounting a downwardpointing triangle. The figure thus forms an inverted symbol of sulphur and,according to Levi, signifies the accomplishments of the magnum opus. In somedecks the figure carries under each arm a money bag from which coins areescaping. Popular tradition associates this card with Judas Iscariot, who issaid to have gone forth and hanged himself, the money bags representing thepayment he received for his crime.Levi likens the hanged man to Prometheus, the Eternal Sufferer, furtherdeclaring that the upturned feet signify the spiritualization of the lowernature. It is also possible that the inverted figure denotes the loss of thespiritual faculties, for the head is below the level of the body. The stumps ofthe twelve branches are the signs of the zodiac divided into two groups—positiveand negative. The picture therefore depicts polarity temporarily triumphant overthe spiritual principle of equilibrium. To attain the heights of philosophy,therefore, man must reverse (or invert) the order of his life. He then loses hissense of personal possession because he renounces the rule of gold in favor ofthe golden rule. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the hanged man is suspendedbetween two palm trees and signifies the Sun God who dies perennially for hisworld.The thirteenth numbered major trump is called La Mort, Death, and portrays areaping skeleton with a great scythe cutting off the heads, hands, and feetrising out of the earth about it. In the course of its labors the skeleton hasapparently cut off one of its own feet. Not all Tarot decks show thispeculiarity, but this point well emphasizes the philosophic truth that unbalanceand destructiveness are synonymous. The skeleton is the proper emblem of thefirst and supreme Deity because it is the foundation of the body, as theAbsolute is the foundation of creation. The reaping skeleton physicallysignifies death but philosophically that irresistible impulse in Nature whichcauses every being to be ultimately absorbed into the divine condition in whichit existed before the illusionary universe had been manifested. The blade of thescythe is the moon with its crystallizing power. The field in which death reapsis the universe, and the card discloses that all things growing out of the earthshall be cut down and return to earth again.Kings, queens, courtesans, and knaves are alike to death, the master of thevisible and apparent parts of all creatures. In some Tarot decks death issymbolized as a figure in armor mounted on a white horse which tramples underfoot old and young alike. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot a rainbow is seen behindthe figure of death, thus signifying that the mortality of the body of itselfachieves the immortality of the spirit. Death, though it destroys form, cannever destroy life, which continually renews itself. This card is the symbol ofthe constant renovation of the universe—disintegration that reintegration mayfollow upon a higher level of expression.The fourteenth numbered major trump is called La Temperance, Temperance, andportrays an angelic figure with the sun upon her forehead. She carries two urns,one empty and the other full, and continually pours the contents of the upperinto the lower. In some Tarot decks the flowing water takes the form of thesymbol of Aquarius. Not one drop, however, of the living water is lost in thisendless transference between the superior vessel and the inferior. When thelower urn is filled the vases are reversed, thus signifying that life poursfirst from the invisible into the visible, then from the visible back into theinvisible. The spirit controlling this flow is an emissary of the great Jehovah,Demiurgus of the world. The sun, or light cluster, upon the woman’s foreheadcontrols the flow of water, which, being drawn upward into the air by the solarrays, descends upon the earth as rain, to be drawn up and fall again adinfinitum. Herein is also shown the passage of the human life forces back andforth between the positive and negative poles of the creative system. In thepseudo-Egyptian Tarot the symbolism is the same, except that the winged figureis male instead of female. It is surrounded by a solar nimbus and pours waterfrom a golden urn into a silver one, typifying the descent of the celestialforces into the sublunary spheres.The fifteenth numbered major trump is called Le Diable, the Devil, and portraysa creature resembling Pan with the horns of a ram or deer, the arms and body ofa man, and the legs and feet of a goat or dragon. The figure stands upon a cubicstone, to a ring in the front of which are chained two satyrs. For a scepterthis so-called demon carries a lighted torch or candle. The entire figure issymbolic of the magic powers of the astral light, or universal mirror, in whichthe divine forces are reflected in an inverted, or infernal, state. The demon iswinged like a bat, showing that it pertains to the nocturnal, or shadowy,inferior sphere. The animal natures of man, in the form of a male and a femaleelemental, are chained to its footstool. The torch is the false light whichguides unillumined souls to their own undoing. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarotappears Typhon—a winged creature composed of a hog, a man, a bat, a crocodile,and a hippopotamus—standing in the midst of its own destructiveness and holdingaloft the firebrand of the incendiary. Typhon is created by man’s own misdeeds,which, turning upon their maker, destroy him.The sixteenth numbered major trump is called Le Feu du Ciel, the Fire of Heaven,and portrays a tower the battlements of which, in the form of a crown, are beingdestroyed by a bolt of lightning issuing from the sun. The crown, beingconsiderably smaller than the tower which it surmounts, possibly indicates thatits destruction resulted from its insufficiency The lightning bolt sometimestakes the form of the zodiacal sign of Scorpio and the tower may be considered aphallic emblem. Two figures are falling from the tower, one in front and theother behind. This Tarot card is popularly associated with the traditional fallof man. The divine nature of humanity is depicted as a tower. When his crown isdestroyed, man falls into the lower world and takes upon himself the illusion ofmateriality. Here also is a key to the mystery of sex. The tower is supposedlyfilled with gold coins which, showering out in great numbers from the rent madeby the lightning bolt, suggest potential powers. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarotthe tower is a pyramid, its apex shattered by a lightning bolt. Here is areference to the missing capstone of the Universal House. In support of Levi’scontention that this card is connected with the Hebrew letter Ayin, the fallingfigure in the foreground is similar in general appearance to the sixteenthletter of the Hebrew alphabet.The seventeenth numbered major trump is called Les Etoiles, the Stars, andportrays a young girl kneeling with one foot in water and the other on land, herbody somewhat suggesting the swastika. She has two urns, the contents of whichshe pours upon the land and sea. Above the girl’s head are eight stars, one ofwhich is exceptionally large and bright. Court de Gébelin considers the greatstar to be Sothis, or Sirius; the other seven are the sacred planets of theancients. He believes the female figure to be Isis in the act of causing theinundations of the Nile which accompanied the rising of the Dog Star. Theunclothed figure of Isis may well signify that Nature does not receive hergarment of verdure until the rising of the Nile waters releases the germinallife of plants and flowers. The bush and bird (or butterfly) signify the growthand resurrection which accompany the rising of the waters. In thepseudo-Egyptian Tarot the great star contains a diamond composed of a black andwhite triangle, and the flowering bush is a tall plant with a trifoliate headupon which a butterfly alights. Here Isis is in the form of an upright triangleand the vases have become shallow cups. The elements of water and earth underher feet represent the opposites of Nature sharing impartially in the divineabundance.The eighteenth numbered major trump is called La Lune, the Moon, and portraysLuna rising between two towers—one light and the other dark. A dog and a wolfare baying at the rising moon, and in the foreground is a pool of water fromwhich emerges a crawfish. Between the towers a path winds, vanishing in theextreme background. Court de Gébelin sees in this card another reference to therising of the Nile and states on the authority of Pausanius that the Egyptiansbelieved the inundations of the Nile to result from the tears of the moongoddess which, falling into the river, swelled its flow. These tears are seendropping from the lunar face. Court de Gébelin also relates the towers to thePillars of Hercules, beyond which, according to the Egyptians, the luminariesnever passed. He notes also that the Egyptians represented the tropics as dogswho as faithful doorkeepers prevented the sun and moon from penetrating too nearthe poles. The crab or crawfish signifies the retrograde motion of the moon.This card also refers to the path of wisdom. Man in his quest of reality emergesfrom the pool of illusion. After mastering the guardians of the gates of wisdomhe passes between the fortresses of science and theology and follows the windingpath leading to spiritual liberation. His way is faintly lighted by human reason(the moon), which is but a reflection of divine wisdom. In the pseudo-EgyptianTarot the towers are pyramids, the dogs are black and white respectively, andthe moon is partly obscured by clouds. The entire scene suggests the dreary anddesolate place in which the Mystery dramas of the Lesser Rites were enacted.The nineteenth numbered major trump is called Le Soleil, the Sun, and portraystwo children—probably Gemini, the Twins—standing together in a garden surroundedby a magic ring of flowers. One of these children should be shown as male andthe other female. Behind them is a brick wall apparently enclosing the garden.Above the wall the sun is rising, in rays alternately straight and curved.Thirteen teardrops are falling from the solar face. Levi, seeing in the twochildren Faith and Reason, which must coexist as long as the temporal universeendures, writes: “Human equilibrium requires two feet, the worlds gravitate bymeans of two forces, generation needs two sexes. Such is the meaning of thearcanum of Solomon, represented by the two pillars of the temple, Jakin andBohas.” (See Transcendental Magic.) The sun of Truth is shining into the gardenof the world over which these two children, as personifications of eternalpowers, preside. The harmony of the world depends upon the coordination of twoqualities symbolized throughout the ages as the mind and the heart. In thepseudo-Egyptian Tarot the children give place to a youth and a maiden. Abovethem in a solar nimbus is the phallic emblem of generation—a line piercing acircle. Gemini is ruled by Mercury and the two children personify the serpentsentwined around the caduceus.The twentieth numbered major trump is called Le Jugement, the Judgment, andportrays three figures rising apparently from their tombs, though but one coffinis visible. Above them in a blaze of glory is a winged figure (presumably theAngel Gabriel) blowing a trumpet. This Tarot represents the liberation of man’sthreefold spiritual nature from the sepulcher of his material constitution.Since but one-third of the spirit actually enters the physical body, the othertwo-thirds constituting the Hermetic anthropos or overman, only one of the threefigures is actually rising from the tomb. Court de Gébelin believes that thecoffin may have been an afterthought of the card makers and that the sceneactually represents creation rather than resurrection. In philosophy these twowords are practically synonymous. The blast of the trumpet represents theCreative Word, by the intoning of which man is liberated from his terrestriallimitations. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot it is evident that the three figuressignify the parts of a single being, for three mummies are shown emerging fromone mummy case.The twenty-first numbered major trump is called Le Monde, the World, andportrays a female figure draped with a scarf which the wind blows into the formof the Hebrew letter Kaph. Her extended hands—each of which holds a wand—and herleft leg, which crosses behind the right, cause the figure to assume the form ofthe alchemical symbol of sulphur. The central figure is surrounded by a wreathin the form of a vesica piscis which Levi likens to the Qabbalistic crownKether. The Cherubim of Ezekiel’s vision occupy the corners of the card. ThisTarot is called the Microcosm and the Macrocosm because in it are summed upevery agency contributing to the structure of creation. The figure in the formof the emblem of sulphur represents the divine fire and the heart of the GreatMystery. The wreath is Nature, which surrounds the fiery center. The Cherubimrepresent the elements, worlds, forces, and planes issuing out of the divinefiery center of life. The wreath again signifies the crown of the initiate whichis given to those who master the four guardians and enter into the presence ofunveiled Truth. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Cherubim surround a wreathcomposed of twelve trifoliate flowers—the decanates of the zodiac. A humanfigure kneels below this wreath, playing upon a harp of three strings, for thespirit must create harmony in the triple constitution of its inferior naturebefore it can gain for itself the solar crown of immortality.The four suits of the minor trumps are considered as analogous to the fourelements, the four corners of creation, and the four worlds of Qabbalism. Thekey to the lesser Tarots is presumably the Tetragrammaton, or the four-lettername of Jehovah, IHVH. The four suits of the minor trumps represent also themajor divisions of society: cups are the priesthood, swords the military, coinsthe tradesmen, and rods the farming class. From the standpoint of what Court deGébelin calls “political geography,” cups represent the northern countries,swords the Orient, coins the Occident, and rods the southern countries. The tenpip cards of each suit represent the nations composing each of these granddivisions. The kings are their governments, the queens their religions, theknights their histories and national characteristics, and the pages their artsand sciences. Elaborate treatises have been written concerning the use of theTarot cards in divination, but as this practice is contrary to the primarypurpose of the Tarot no profit can result from its discussion.Many interesting examples of early playing cards are found in the museums ofEurope, and there are also noteworthy specimens in the cabinets of variousprivate collectors. A few hand-painted decks exist which are extremely artistic.These depict various important personages contemporary with the artists. In someinstances, the court cards are portraitures of the reigning monarch and hisfamily. In England engraved cards became popular, and in the British Museum arealso to be seen some extremely quaint stenciled cards. Heraldic devices wereemployed; and Chatto, in his Origin and History of Playing Cards, reproducesfour heraldic cards in which the arms of Pope Clement IX adorn the king ofclubs. There have been philosophical decks with emblems chosen from Greek andRoman mythology, also educational decks ornamented with maps or pictorialrepresentations of famous historic places and incidents. Many rare examples ofplaying cards have been found bound into the covers of early books. In Japanthere are card games the successful playing of which requires familiarity withnearly all the literary masterpieces of that nation. In India there are circulardecks depicting episodes from Oriental myths. There are also cards which in onesense of the word are not cards, for the designs are on wood, ivory, and evenmetal. There are comic cards caricaturing disliked persons and places, and thereare cards commemorating various human achievements. During the American CivilWar a patriotic deck was circulated in which stars, eagles, anchors, andAmerican flags were substituted for the suits and the court cards were famousgenerals.Modern playing cards are the minor trumps of the Tarot, from each suit of whichthe page, or valet, has been eliminated, leaving 13 cards. Even in its abridgedform, however, the modern deck is of profound symbolic importance, for itsarrangement is apparently in accord with the divisions of the year. The twocolors, red and black, represent the two grand divisions of the year—that duringwhich the sun is north of the equator and that during which it is south of theequator. The four suits represent the seasons, the ages of the ancient Greeks,and the Yugas of the Hindus. The twelve court cards are the signs of the zodiacarranged in triads of a Father, a Power, and a Mind according to the uppersection of the Bembine Table. The ten pip cards of each suit represent theSephirothic trees existing in each of the four worlds (the suits). The 13 cardsof each suit are the 13 lunar months in each year, and the 52 cards of the deckare the 52 weeks in the year. Counting the number of pips and reckoning thejacks, queens, and kings as 11, 12, and 13 respectively, the sum for the 52cards is 364. If the joker be considered as one point, the result is 365, or thenumber of days in the year. Milton Pottenger believed that the United States ofAmerica was laid out according to the conventional deck of playing cards, andthat the government will ultimately consist of 52 States administered by a 53rdundenominated division, the District of Columbia.The court cards contain a number of important Masonic symbols. Nine are fullface and three are profile. Here is the broken “Wheel of the Law,” signifyingthe nine months of the prenatal epoch and the three degrees of spiritualunfoldment necessary to produce the perfect man. The four armed kings are theEgyptian Ammonian Architects who gouged out the universe with knives. They arealso the cardinal signs of the zodiac. The four queens, carrying eight-petaledflowers symbolic of the Christ, are the fixed signs of the zodiac. The fourjacks, two of whom bear acacia sprigs—the jack of hearts in his hand, the jackof clubs in his hat—are the four common signs of the zodiac. It should be notedalso that the court cards of the spade suit will not look upon the pip in thecorner of the card but face away from it as though fearing this emblem of death.The Grand Master of the Order of the Cards is the king of clubs, who carries theorb as emblematic of his dignity.In its symbolism chess is the most significant of all games. It has been called“the royal game”—the pastime of kings. Like the Tarot cards, the chessmenrepresent the elements of life and philosophy. The game was played in India andChina long before its introduction into Europe. East Indian princes were wont tosit on the balconies of their palaces and play chess with living men standingupon a checkerboard pavement of black and white marble in the courtyard below.It is popularly believed that the Egyptian Pharaohs played chess, but anexamination of their sculpture and illuminations has led to the conclusion thatthe Egyptian game was a form of draughts. In China, chessmen are often carved torepresent warring dynasties, as the Manchu and the Ming. The chessboard consistsof 64 squares alternately black and white and symbolizes the floor of the Houseof the Mysteries. Upon this field of existence or thought move a number ofstrangely carved figures, each according to fixed law. The white king is Ormuzd;the black king, Ahriman; and upon the plains of Cosmos the great war betweenLight and Darkness is fought through all the ages. Of the philosophicalconstitution of man, the kings represent the spirit; the queens the mind; thebishops the emotions; the knights the vitality; the castles, or rooks, thephysical body. The pieces upon the kings’ side are positive; those upon thequeens’ side, negative. The pawns are the sensory impulses and perceptivefaculties—the eight parts of the soul. The white king and his suite symbolizethe Self and its vehicles; the black king and his retinue, the not-self—thefalse Ego and its legion. The game of chess thus sets forth the eternal struggleof each part of man’s compound nature against the shadow of itself. The natureof each of the chessmen is revealed by the way in which it moves; geometry isthe key to their interpretation. For example: The castle (the body) moves on thesquare; the bishop (the emotions) moves on the slant; the king, being thespirit, cannot be captured, but loses the battle when so surrounded that itcannot escape."},{"pageContent":"XXX The Tabernacle in the Wilderness There is no doubt that much of the material recorded in the first five books ofthe Old Testament is derived from the initiatory rituals of the EgyptianMysteries. The priests of Isis were deeply versed in occult lore, and theIsraelites during their captivity in Egypt learned from them many thingsconcerning the significance of Divinity and the manner of worshiping It. Theauthorship of the first five books of the Old Testament is generally attributedto Moses, but whether or not he was the actual writer of them is a matter ofcontroversy. There is considerable evidence to substantiate the hypothesis thatthe Pentateuch was compiled at a much later date, from oral traditions.Concerning the authorship of these books, Thomas Inman makes a rather startlingstatement: “It is true that we have books which purport to be the books ofMoses; so there are, or have been, books purporting to be written by Homer,Orpheus, Enoch, Mormon, and Junius; yet the existence of the writings, and thebelief that they were written by those whose name they bear, are no realevidences of the men or the genuineness of the works called by their names. Itis true also that Moses is spoken of occasionally in the time of the early Kingsof Jerusalem; but it is clear that these passages are written by a late hand,and have been introduced into the places where they are found, with the definiteintention of making it appear that the lawgiver was known to David and Solomon.”(See Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names.)While this noted scholar undoubtedly had much evidence to support his belief, itseems that this statement is somewhat too sweeping in character. It isapparently based upon the fact that Thomas Inman doubted the historicalexistence of Moses. This doubt was based upon the etymological resemblance ofthe word Moses to an ancient name for the sun. As the result of thesedeductions, Inman sought to prove that the Lawgiver of Israel was merely anotherform of the omnipresent solar myth. While Inman demonstrated that by transposingtwo of the ancient letters the word Moses (190 [images/00191.jpg]) becameShemmah (191 [images/00192.jpg]), an appellation of the celestial globe, heseems to have overlooked the fact that in the ancient Mysteries the initiateswere often given names synonymous with the sun, to symbolize the fact that theredemption and regeneration of the solar power had been achieved within theirown natures. It is far more probable that the man whom we know as Moses was anaccredited representative of the secret schools, laboring—as many otheremissaries have labored—to instruct primitive races in the mysteries of theirimmortal souls.192 [images/00193.jpg] THE ANCIENT OF DAYS.It is in this form that Jehovah is generally pictured by the Qabbalists. Thedrawing is intended to represent the Demiurgus of the Greeks and Gnostics,called by the Greeks “Zeus,” the Immortal Mortal, and by the Hebrews “IHUH.”The true name of the Grand Old Man of Israel who is known to history as Moseswill probably never be ascertained. The word Moses, when understood in itsesoteric Egyptian sense, means one who has been admitted into the MysterySchools of Wisdom and has gone forth to teach the ignorant concerning the willof the gods and the mysteries of life, as these mysteries were explained withinthe temples of Isis, Osiris, and Serapis. There is much controversy concerningthe nationality of Moses. Some assert that he was a Jew, adopted and educated bythe ruling house of Egypt; others hold the opinion that he was a full-bloodedEgyptian. A few even believe him to be identical with the immortal Hermes, forboth these illustrious founders of religious systems received tablets fromheaven supposedly written by the finger of God. The stories told concerningMoses, his discovery in the ark of bulrushes by Pharaoh’s daughter, his adoptioninto the royal family of Egypt, and his later revolt against Egyptian autocracycoincide exactly with certain ceremonies through which the candidates of theEgyptian Mysteries passed in their ritualistic wanderings in search of truth andunderstanding. The analogy can also be traced in the movements of the heavenlybodies.It is not strange that the erudite Moses, initiated in Egypt, should teach theJews a philosophy containing the more important principles of Egyptianesotericism. The religions of Egypt at the time of the Israelitic captivity werefar older than even the Egyptian priests themselves realized. Histories weredifficult to compile in those days, and the Egyptians were satisfied to tracetheir race back to a mythological period when the gods themselves walked theearth and with their own power established the Double Empire of the Nile. TheEgyptians did not dream that these divine progenitors were the Atlanteans, who,forced to abandon their seven islands because of volcanic cataclysms, hadimmigrated into Egypt—then an Atlantean colony—where they established a greatphilosophic and literary center of civilization which was later to influenceprofoundly the religions and sciences of unnumbered races and peoples. TodayEgypt is forgotten, but things Egyptian will always be remembered and revered.Egypt is dead—yet it lives immortal in its literature, philosophy, andarchitectonics.As Odin founded his Mysteries in Scandinavia, and Quexalcoatl in Mexico, soMoses, laboring with the then nomadic people of Israel’s twelve tribes,established in the midst of them his secret and symbolic school, which has cometo be known as The Tabernacle Mysteries. The Tabernacle of the Jews was merely atemple patterned after the temples of Egypt, and transportable to meet the needsof that roving disposition for which the Israelites were famous. Every part ofthe Tabernacle and the enclosure which surrounded it was symbolic of some greatnatural or philosophic truth. To the ignorant it was but a place to which tobring offerings and in which to make sacrifice; to the wise it was a temple oflearning, sacred to the Universal Spirit of Wisdom.While the greatest minds of the Jewish and Christian worlds have realized thatthe Bible is a book of allegories, few seem to have taken the trouble toinvestigate its symbols and parables. When Moses instituted his Mysteries, he issaid to have given to a chosen few initiates certain oral teachings which couldnever be written but were to be preserved from one generation to the next byword-of-mouth transmission. Those instructions were in the form of philosophicalkeys, by means of which the allegories were made to reveal their hiddensignificance. These mystic keys to their sacred writings were called by the Jewsthe Qabbalah (Cabala, Kaballah).The modem world seems to have forgotten the existence of those unwrittenteachings which explained satisfactorily the apparent contradictions of thewritten Scriptures, nor does it remember that the pagans appointed theirtwo-faced Janus as custodian of the key to the Temple of Wisdom. Janus has beenmetamorphosed into St. Peter, so often symbolized as holding in his hand the keyto the gate of heaven. The gold and silver keys of “God’s Vicar on Earth,” thePope, symbolize this “secret doctrine” which, when properly understood, unlocksthe treasure chest of the Christian and Jewish Qabbalah.The temples of Egyptian mysticism (from which the Tabernacle was copied)were—according to their own priests—miniature representations of the universe.The solar system was always regarded as a great temple of initiation, whichcandidates entered through the gates of birth; after threading the tortuouspassageways of earthly existence, they finally approached the veil of the GreatMystery—Death—through whose gate they vanished back into the invisible world.Socrates subtly reminded his disciples that Death was, in reality, the greatinitiation, for his last words were: “Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will youremember to pay the debt?” (As the rooster was sacred to the gods and thesacrifice of this bird accompanied a candidate’s introduction into theMysteries, Socrates implied that he was about to take his great initiation.)Life is the great mystery, and only those who pass successfully through itstests and trials, interpreting them aright and extracting the essence ofexperience therefrom, achieve true understanding. Thus, the temples were builtin the form of the world and their rituals were based upon life and itsmultitudinous problems. Not only was the Tabernacle itself patterned accordingto Egyptian mysticism; its utensils were also of ancient and accepted form. TheArk of the Covenant itself was an adaptation of the Egyptian Ark, even to thekneeling figures upon its lid. Bas-reliefs on the Temple of Philæ show Egyptianpriests carrying their Ark—which closely resembled the Ark of the Jews—upontheir shoulders by means of staves like those described in Exodus.The following description of the Tabernacle and its priests is based upon theaccount of its construction and ceremonies recorded by Josephus in the ThirdBook of his Antiquities of the Jews. The Bible references are from a “Breeches”Bible (famous for its rendering of the seventh verse of the third chapter ofGenesis), printed in London in 1599, and the quotations are reproduced in theiroriginal spelling and punctuation."},{"pageContent":"THE BUILDING OF THE TABERNACLE Moses, speaking for Jehovah, the God of Israel, appointed two architects tosuperintend the building of the Tabernacle. They were Besaleel, the son of Uri,of the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.Their popularity was so great that they were also the unanimous choice of thepeople. When Jacob upon his deathbed blessed his sons (see Genesis xlix), heassigned to each a symbol. The symbol of Judah was a lion; that of Dan a serpentor a bird (possibly an eagle). The lion and the eagle are two of the four beastsof the Cherubim (the fixed signs of the zodiac); and the Rosicrucian alchemistsmaintained that the mysterious Stone of the Wise (the Soul) was compounded withthe aid of the Blood of the Red Lion and the Gluten of the White Eagle. It seemsprobable that there is a hidden mystic relationship between fire (the Red Lion),water (the White Eagle), as they were used in occult chemistry, and therepresentatives of these two tribes whose symbols were identical with thesealchemical elements.As the Tabernacle was the dwelling place of God among men, likewise the soulbody in man is the dwelling place of his divine nature, round which gathers atwelvefold material constitution in the same manner that the tribes of Israelcamped about the enclosure sacred to Jehovah. The idea that the Tabernacle wasreally symbolic of an invisible spiritual truth outside the comprehension of theIsraelites is substantiated by a statement made in the eighth chapter ofHebrews: “Who serve unto the paterne and shadowe of heavenly things, as Moseswas warned by God, when he was about to finish the Tabernacle.” Here we find thematerial physical place of worship called a “shadow” or symbol of a spiritualinstitution, invisible but omnipotent.The specifications of the Tabernacle are described in the book of Exodus,twenty-fifth chapter: “Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speake unto thechildren of Israel that they receive an offering for me: of every man, whoseheart giveth it freely, ye shall take the offering for me. And this is theoffering which ye shall take of them, gold and silver, and brass, and bluesilke, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linnen and goats haire. And rammesskinnes coloured red, and the skinnes of badgers, and the wood Shittim, oyle forthe light, spices for anoynting oyle, and for the perfume of sweet favour, onixstones, and stones to be set in the Ephod, and in the breastplate. Also theyshall make me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. According to all that Ishew thee, even so shall ye make the forme of the Tabernacle, and the fashion ofall the instruments thereof.”The court of the Tabernacle was an enclosed area, fifty cubits wide and onehundred cubits long, circumscribed by a wall of linen curtains hung from brazenpillars five cubits apart. (The cubit is an ancient standard of measurement, itslength being equal to the distance between the elbow and the extreme end of theindex finger, approximately eighteen inches.) There were twenty of these pillarson each of the longer sides and ten on the shorter. Each pillar had a base ofbrass and a capital of silver. The Tabernacle was always laid out with the longsides facing north and south and the short sides facing east and west, with theentrance to the east, thus showing the influence of primitive sun worship.The outer court served the principal purpose of isolating the tent of theTabernacle proper, which stood in the midst of the enclosure. At the entrance tothe courtyard, which was in the eastern face of the rectangle, stood the Altarof Burnt Offerings, made of brass plates over wood and ornamented with the hornsof bulls and rams. Farther in, but on a line with this altar, stood the Laver ofPurification, a great vessel containing water for priestly ablutions. The Laverwas twofold in its construction, the upper part being a large bowl, probablycovered, which served as a source of supply for a lower basin in which thepriests bathed themselves before participating in the various ceremonials. It issupposed that this Laver was encrusted with the metal mirrors of the women ofthe twelve tribes of Israel.The dimensions of the Tabernacle proper were as follows: “Its length, when itwas set up, was thirty cubits, and its breadth was ten cubits. The one of itswalls was on the south, and the other was exposed to the north, and on the backpart of it remained the west. It was necessary that its height should be equalto its breadth (ten cubits).” (Josephus.)It is the custom of bibliologists to divide the interior of the Tabernacle intotwo rooms: one room ten cubits wide, ten cubits high, and twenty cubits long,which was called the Holy Place and contained three special articles offurniture, namely, the Seven-Branched Candlestick, the Table of the Shewbread,and the Altar of Burnt Incense; the other room ten cubits wide, ten cubits high,and ten cubits long, which was called the Holy of Holies and contained but onearticle of furniture—the Ark of the Covenant. The two rooms were separated fromeach other by an ornamental veil upon which were embroidered many kinds offlowers, but no animal or human figures.Josephus hints that there was a third compartment which was formed bysubdividing the Holy Place, at least hypothetically, into two chambers. TheJewish historian is not very explicit in his description of this third room, andthe majority of writers seem to have entirely overlooked and neglected thispoint, although Josephus emphatically states that Moses himself divided theinner tent into three sections. The veil separating the Holy Place from the Holyof Holies was hung across four pillars, which probably indicated in a subtle waythe four elements, while at the entrance to the tent proper the Jews placedseven pillars, referring to the seven senses and the seven vowels of the SacredName. That later only five pillars are mentioned may be accounted for by thefact that at the present time man has only five developed senses and five activevowels. The early Jewish writer of The Baraitha treats of the curtains asfollows:“There were provided ten curtains of blue, of purple, and scarlet, andfine-twined linen. As is said, ‘Moreover thou shall make the tabernacle with tencurtains of fine-twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet.’ * * * Therewere provided eleven curtains of goats’ hair, and the length of every one ofthem was thirty cubits, * * *. Rabbi Judah said, ‘There were two covers—thelower one of rams’ skins dyed red, and the upper one of badgers’ skins.”’Calmet is of the opinion that the Hebrew word translated “badger” really means“dark purple” and therefore did not refer to any particular animal, but probablyto a heavily woven waterproof fabric of dark and inconspicuous color. During thetime of Israel’s wanderings through the wilderness, it is supposed that a pillarof fire hovered over the Tabernacle at night, while a column of smoke traveledwith it by day. This cloud was called by the Jews the Shechinah and was symbolicof the presence of the Lord. In one of the early Jewish books rejected at thetime of the compiling of the Talmud the following description of the Shechinahappears:“Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lordfilled the Tabernacle. And that was one of the clouds of glory, which served theIsraelites in the wilderness forty years. One on the right hand, and one on theleft, and one before them, and one behind them. And one over them, and a clouddwelling in their midst (and the cloud, the Shechinah which was in the tent),and the pillar of cloud which moved before them, making low before them the highplaces, and making high before them the low places, and killing serpents andscorpions, and burning thorns and briars, and guiding them in the straight way.”(From The Baraitha, the Book of the Tabernacle.)"},{"pageContent":"THE FURNISHINGS OF THE TABERNACLE There is no doubt that the Tabernacle, its furnishings and ceremonials, whenconsidered esoterically, are analogous to the structure, organs, and functionsof the human body. At the entrance to the outer court of the Tabernacle stoodthe Altar of Burnt Offerings, five cubits long and five cubits wide but onlythree cubits high. Its upper surface was a brazen grill upon which the sacrificewas placed, while beneath was a space for the fire. This altar signified that acandidate, when first entering the precincts of sanctuary, must offer upon thebrazen altar not a poor unoffending bull or ram but its correspondence withinhis own nature. The bull, being symbolic of earthiness, represented his owngross constitution which must be burned up by the fire of his Divinity. (Thesacrificing of beasts, and in some cases human beings, upon the altars of thepagans was the result of their ignorance concerning the fundamental principleunderlying sacrifice. They did not realize that their offerings must come fromwithin their own natures in order to be acceptable.)Farther westward, in line with the Brazen Altar, was the Laver of Purificationalready described. It signified to the priest that he should cleanse not onlyhis body but also his soul from all stains of impurity, for none who is notclean in both body and mind can enter into the presence of Divinity and live.Beyond the Laver of Purification was the entrance to the Tabernacle proper,facing the east, so that the first rays of the rising sun might enter and lightthe chamber. Between the encrusted pillars could be seen the Holy Place, amysterious chamber, its walls hung with magnificent drapes embroidered with thefaces of Cherubs.Against the wall on the southern side of the Holy Place stood the greatCandlestick, or lampstand, of cast gold, which was believed to weigh about ahundred pounds. From its central shaft branched out six arms, each ending in acup-shaped depression in which stood an oil lamp. There were seven lamps, threeon the arms at each side and one on the central stem. The Candlestick wasornamented with seventy-two almonds, knops, and flowers. Josephus says seventy,but wherever this round number is used by the Hebrews it really meansseventy-two. Opposite the Candlestick, against the northern wall, was a tablebearing twelve loaves of Shewbread in two stacks of six loaves each. (Calmet isof the opinion that the bread was not stacked up but spread out on the table intwo rows, each containing six loaves.) On this table also stood two lightedincensories, which were placed upon the tops of the stacks of Shewbread so thatthe smoke of the incense might be an acceptable aroma to the Lord, bearing withit in its ascent the soul of the Shewbread.n the center of the room, almost against the partition leading into the Holy ofHolies, stood the Altar of Burnt Incense, made of wood overlaid with goldenplates. Its width and length were each a cubit and its height was two cubits.This altar was symbolic of the human larynx, from which the words of man’s mouthascend as an acceptable offering unto the Lord, for the larynx occupies theposition in the constitution of man between the Holy Place, which is the trunkof his body, and the Holy of Holies, which is the head with its contents.Into the Holy of Holies none might pass save the High Priest, and he only atcertain prescribed times. The room contained no furnishings save the Ark of theCovenant, which stood against the western wall, opposite the entrance. In Exodusthe dimensions of the Ark are given as two and a half cubits for its length, onecubit and a half its breadth and one cubit and a half its height. It was made ofshittim-wood, gold plated within and without, and contained the sacred tabletsof the Law delivered to Moses upon Sinai. The lid of the Ark was in the form ofa golden plate upon which knelt two mysterious creatures called Cherubim, facingeach other, with wings arched overhead. It was upon this mercy seat between thewings of the celestials that the Lord of Israel descended when He desired tocommunicate with His High Priest.The furnishings of the Tabernacle were made conveniently portable. Each altarand implement of any size was supplied with staves which could be put throughrings; by this means it could be picked up and carried by four or more bearers.The staves were never removed from the Ark of the Covenant until it was finallyplaced in the Holy of Holies of the Everlasting House, King Solomon’s Temple.There is no doubt that the Jews in early times realized, at least in part, thattheir Tabernacle was a symbolic edifice. Josephus realized this and while he hasbeen severely criticized because he interpreted the Tabernacle symbolismaccording to Egyptian and Grecian paganism, his description of the secretmeanings of its drapes and furnishings is well worthy of consideration. He says:“When Moses distinguished the tabernacle into three parts, and allowed two ofthem to the priests, as a place accessible and common, he denoted the land andthe sea, these being of general access to all; but he set apart the thirddivision for God, because heaven is inaccessible to men. And when he orderedtwelve loaves to be set on a table, he denoted the year, as distinguished intoso many months. By branching out the candlestick into seventy parts, he secretlyintimated the Decani, or seventy divisions of the planets; and as to the sevenlamps upon the candlesticks, they referred to the course of the planets, ofwhich that is the number. The veils too, which were composed of four things,they declared the four elements; for the plain linen was proper to signify theearth, because the flax grows out of the earth; the purple signified the sea,because that color is dyed by the blood of a sea shell-fish; the blue is fit tosignify the air; and the scarlet will naturally be an indication of fire.“Now the vestment of the high-priest being made of linen, signified the earth;the blue denoted the sky, being like lightning in its pomegranates, and in thenoise of the bells resembling thunder. And for the Ephod, it showed that God hadmade the universe of four (elements); and as for the gold interwoven, * * * itrelated to the splendor by which all things are enlightened. He also appointedthe breastplate to be placed in the middle of the Ephod, to resemble the earth,for that has the very middle place of the world. And the girdle whichencompassed the high-priest round signified the ocean, for that goes round aboutand includes the universe. Each of the sardonyxes declares to us the sun and themoon, those, I mean, that were in the nature of buttons on the high-priest’sshoulders. And for the twelve stones, whether we understand by them the months,or whether we understand the like number of the signs of that circle which theGreeks call the Zodiac, we shall not be mistaken in their meaning. And for themitre, which was of a blue colour, it seems to me to mean heaven; for howotherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it? That it was alsoillustrated with a crown, and that of gold also, is because of that splendourwith which God is pleased.“ It is also symbolically significant that theTabernacle was built in seven months and dedicated to God at the time of the newmoon.193 [images/00194.jpg] THE ARK WITH ITS CHERUBIM.Josephus tells us that the Cherubim were flying creatures but different inappearance from anything to be seen on earth; therefore impossible to describe.Moses is supposed to have seen these beings kneeling at the footstool of Godwhen he was picked up and brought into the presence of Jehovah. It is probablethat they resembled, at least in general appearance, the famous Cherubim ofEzekiel. The metals used in the building of the Tabernacle were all emblematic. Goldrepresents spirituality, and the golden plates laid over the shittim-wood wereemblems of the spiritual nature which glorifies the human nature symbolized bythe wood. Mystics have taught that man’s physical body is surrounded by a seriesof invisible bodies of diverse colors and great splendor. In the majority ofpeople the spiritual nature is concealed and imprisoned in the material nature,but in a few this internal constitution has been objectified and the spiritualnature is outside, so that it surrounds man’s personality with a great radiance.Silver, used as the capitals for the pillars, has its reference to the moon,which was sacred to the Jews and the Egyptians alike. The priests held secretritualistic ceremonies at the times of the new and the full moon, both of whichperiods were sacred to Jehovah. Silver, so the ancients taught, was gold withits sun-ray turned inward instead of objectified. While gold symbolized thespiritual soul, silver represented the purified and regenerated human nature ofman.The brass used in the outer altars was a composite substance consisting of analloy of precious and base metals. Thus, it represented the constitution of theaverage individual, who is a combination of both the higher and the lowerelements.The three divisions of the Tabernacle should have a special interest toFreemasons, for they represent the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, while thethree orders of priests who served the Tabernacle are preserved to modernMasonry as the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craftsman, and the Master Mason.The Hawaiian Islanders built a Tabernacle not unlike that of the Jews, exceptthat their rooms were one above another and not one behind another, as in thecase of the Tabernacle of the Israelites. The three rooms are also the threeimportant chambers of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh."},{"pageContent":"THE ROBES OF GLORY As explained in the quotation from Josephus, the robes and adornments of theJewish priests had a secret significance, and even to this day there is areligious cipher language concealed in the colors, forms, and uses of sacredgarments, not only among the Christian and Jewish priests but also among paganreligions. The vestments of the Tabernacle priests were called Cahanææ; those ofthe High Priest were termed Cahanææ Rabbœ. Over the Machanese, an undergarmentresembling short trousers, they wore the Chethone, a finely woven linen robe,which reached to the ground and had long sleeves tied to the arms of the wearer.A brightly embroidered sash, twisted several times around the waist (a littlehigher than is customary), with one end pendent in front, and a closely fittinglinen cap, designated Masnaemphthes, completed the costume of the ordinarypriest.The vestments of the High Priest were the same as those of the lesser degrees,except that certain garments and adornments were added. Over the specially wovenwhite linen robe the High Priest wore a seamless and sleeveless habit, sky-bluein color and reaching nearly to his feet. This was called the Meeir and wasornamented with a fringe of alternated golden bells and pomegranates. InEcclesiasticus (one of the books rejected from the modern Bible), these bellsand their purpose are described in the following words: “And he compassed himwith pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went,there might be a sound and a noise that might be heard in the temple, for amemorial to the children of his people.” The Meeir was also bound in with avariegated girdle finely embroidered and with gold wire inserted through theembroidery.The Ephod, a short vestment described by Josephus as resembling a coat orjacket, was worn over the upper part of the Meeir. The threads of which theEphod was woven were of many colors, probably red, blue, purple, and white, likethe curtains and coverings of the Tabernacle. Fine gold wires were also woveninto the fabric. The Ephod was fastened at each shoulder with a large onyx inthe form of a button, and the names of the twelve sons of Jacob were engravenupon these two stones, six on each. These onyx buttons were supposed to haveoracular powers, and when the High Priest asked certain questions, they emitteda celestial radiance. When the onyx on the right shoulder was illuminated, itsignified that Jehovah answered the question of the High Priest in theaffirmative, and when the one on the left gleamed, it indicated a negativeanswer to the query.In the middle of the front surface of the Ephod was a space to accommodate theEssen, or Breastplate of Righteousness and Prophecy, which, as its namesignifies, was also an oracle of great power. This pectoral was roughly squarein shape and consisted of a frame of embroidery into which were set twelvestones, each held in a socket of gold. Because of the great weight of itsstones, each of which was of considerable size and immense value, thebreastplate was held in position by special golden chains and ribbons. Thetwelve stones of the breastplate, like the onyx stones at the shoulders of theEphod, had the mysterious power of lighting up with Divine glory and so servingas oracles. Concerning the strange power of these flashing symbols of Israel’stwelve tribes, Josephus writes:“Yet will I mention what is still more wonderful than this: For God declaredbeforehand, by those twelve stones which the High Priest bare upon his breastand which were inserted into his breastplate, when they should be victorious inbattle; for so great a splendor shone forth from them before the army began tomarch, that all the people were sensible of God’s being present for theirassistance. Whence it came to pass that those Greeks, who had a veneration forour laws, because they could not possibly contradict this, called thebreastplate ‘the Oracle’.” The writer then adds that the stones ceased to lightup and gleam some two hundred years before he wrote his history, because theJews had broken the laws of Jehovah and the God of Israel was no longer pleasedwith His chosen people.The Jews learned astronomy from the Egyptians, and it is not unlikely that thetwelve jewels of the breastplate were symbolic of the twelve constellations ofthe zodiac. These twelve celestial hierarchies were looked upon as jewelsadorning the breastplate of the Universal Man, the Macroprosophus, who isreferred to in the Zohar as The Ancient of Days. The number twelve frequentlyoccurs among ancient peoples, who in nearly every case had a pantheon consistingof twelve demigods and goddesses presided over by The Invincible One, who wasHimself subject to the Incomprehensible All-Father. This use of the numbertwelve is especially noted in the Jewish and Christian writings. The twelveprophets, the twelve patriarchies, the twelve tribes, and the twelveApostles—each group has a certain occult significance, for each refers to theDivine Duodecimo, or Twelvefold Deity, whose emanations are manifested in thetangible created Universe through twelve individualized channels. The secretdoctrine also taught the priests that the jewels represented centers of lifewithin their own constitutions, which when unfolded according to the esotericinstructions of the Temple, were capable of absorbing into themselves andradiating forth again the Divine light of the Deity. (The East Indian lotusblossoms have a similar meaning.) The Rabbis have taught that each twisted linenthread used in weaving the Tabernacle curtains and ornamentations consisted oftwenty-four separate strands, reminding the discerning that the experiencegained during the twenty-four hours of the day (symbolized in Masonry by thetwenty-four-inch rule) becomes the threads from which are woven the Garments ofGlory."},{"pageContent":"THE URIM AND THUMMIM In the reverse side of the Essen, or breastplate, was a pocket containingmysterious objects—the Urim and Thummim. Aside from the fact that they were usedin divination, little is now known about these objects. Some writers contendthat they were small stones (resembling the fetishes still revered by certainaboriginal peoples) which the Israelites had brought with them out of Egyptbecause of their belief that they possessed divine power. Others believe thatthe Urim and Thummim were in the form of dice, used for deciding events by beingcast upon the ground. A few have maintained that they were merely sacred names,written on plates of gold and carried as talismans. “According to some, the Urimand the Thummim signify ‘lights and perfections,’ or ‘light and truth’ whichlast present a striking analogy to the two figures of Re (Ra) and Themi in thebreastplate worn by the Egyptians.” (Gardner’s The Faiths of the World.)Not the least remarkable of the vestments of the High Priest was his bonnet, orheaddress. Over the plain white cap of the ordinary priest this dignitary worean outer cloth of blue and a crown of gold, the crown consisting of three bands,one above the other like the triple miter of the Persian Magi. This crownsymbolized that the High Priest was ruler not only over the three worlds whichthe ancients had differentiated (heaven, earth, and hell), but also over thethreefold divisions of man and the universe—the spiritual, intellectual, andmaterial worlds. These divisions were also symbolized by the three apartments ofthe Tabernacle itself.At the peak of the headdress was a tiny cup of gold, made in the form of aflower. This signified that the nature of the priest was receptive and that hehad a vessel in his own soul which, cuplike, was capable of catching the eternalwaters of life pouring upon him from the heavens above. This flower over thecrown of his head is similar in its esoteric meaning to the rose growing out ofa skull, so famous in Templar symbology. The ancients believed that thespiritual nature escaping from the body passed upward through the crown of thehead; therefore, the flowerlike calyx, or cup, symbolized also the spiritualconsciousness. On the front of the golden crown were inscribed in Hebrew,Holiness unto the Lord.Though robes and ornaments augmented the respect and veneration of theIsraelites for their High Priest, such trappings meant nothing to Jehovah.Therefore, before entering the Holy of Holies, the High Priest removed hisearthly finery and entered into the presence of the Lord God of Israelunclothed. There he could be robed only in his own virtues, and his spiritualitymust adorn him as a garment.There is a legend to the effect that any who chanced to enter the Holy of Holiesunclean were destroyed by a bolt of Divine fire from the Mercy Seat. If the HighPriest had but one selfish thought, he would be struck dead. As no man knowswhen an unworthy thought may flash through his mind, precautions had to be takenin case the High Priest should be struck dead while in the presence of Jehovah.The other priests could not enter the sanctuary; therefore, when their leaderwas about to go in and receive the commands of the Lord, they tied a chainaround one of his feet so that if he were struck down while behind the veil theycould drag the body out."},{"pageContent":"XXXI The Fraternity of the Rose Cross Tho were the Rosicrucians? Were they an organization of profound thinkersrebelling against the inquisitional religious and philosophical limitations oftheir time or were they isolated transcendentalists united only by thesimilarity of their viewpoints and deductions? Where was the “House of the HolySpirit,” in which, according to their manifestoes, they met once a year to planthe future activities of their Order? Who was the mysterious person referred toas “Our Illustrious Father and Brother C.R.C.”? Did those three letters actuallystand for the words “Christian Rosie Cross”? Was Christian Rosencreutz, thesupposed author of the Chymical Nuptials, the same person who with three othersfounded “The Society of the Rose Cross”?What relationship existed between Rosicrucianism and mediaeval Freemasonry ? Whywere the destinies of these two organizations so closely interwoven? Is the“Brotherhood of the Rose Cross” the much-sought-after link connecting theFreemasonry of the Middle Ages with the symbolism and mysticism of antiquity,and are its secrets being perpetuated by modern Masonry? Did the originalRosicrucian Order disintegrate in the latter part of the eighteenth century, ordoes the Society still exist as an organization, maintaining the same secrecyfor which it was originally famous? What was the true purpose for which the“Brotherhood of the Rose Cross” was formed? Were the Rosicrucians a religiousand philosophic brotherhood, as they claimed to be, or were their avowed tenetsa blind to conceal the true object of the Fraternity, which possibly was thepolitical control of Europe? These are some of the problems involved in thestudy of Rosicrucianism.There are four distinct theories regarding the Rosicrucian enigma. Each is theresult of a careful consideration of the evidence by scholars who have spenttheir lives ransacking the archives of Hermetic lore. The conclusions reacheddemonstrate clearly the inadequacy of the records available concerning thegenesis and early activities of the “Brethren of the Rose Cross.”"},{"pageContent":"THE FIRST POSTULATE It is assumed that the Rosicrucian Order existed historically in accordance withthe description of its foundation and subsequent activities published in itsmanifesto, the Fama Fraternitatis, which is believed to have been written in theyear 1610, but apparently did not appear in print until 1614, although anearlier edition is suspected by some authorities. Intelligent consideration ofthe origin of Rosicrucianism requires a familiarity with the contents of thefirst and most important of its documents. The Fama Fraternitatis begins with areminder to all the world of God’s goodness and mercy, and it warns theintelligentsia that their egotism and covetousness cause them to follow afterfalse prophets and to ignore the true knowledge which God in His goodness hasrevealed to them. Hence, a reformation is necessary, and God has raised upphilosophers and sages for this purpose.In order to assist in bringing about the reformation, a mysterious person called“The Highly Illuminated Father C.R.C.,” a German by birth, descended of a noblefamily, but himself a poor man, instituted the “Secret Society of the RoseCross.” C.R.C. was placed in a cloister when only five years of age, but laterbecoming dissatisfied with its educational system, he associated himself with abrother of Holy Orders who was setting forth on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.They started out together, but the brother died at Cyprus and C.R.C. continuedalone to Damascus. Poor health prevented him from reaching Jerusalem, so heremained at Damascus, studying with the philosophers who dwelt there.While pursuing his studies, he heard of a group of mystics and Qabbalistsabiding in the mystic Arabian city of Damcar. Giving up his desire to visitJerusalem, he arranged with the Arabians for his transportation to Damcar.C.R.C. was but sixteen years of age when he arrived at Damcar. He was receivedas one who had been long expected, a comrade and a friend in philosophy, and wasinstructed in the secrets of the Arabian adepts. While there, C.R.C. learned theArabic tongue and translated the sacred book M into Latin, and upon returning toEurope he brought this important volume with him.After studying three years in Damcar, C.R.C. departed for the city of Fez, wherethe Arabian magicians declared further information would be given him. At Fez hewas instructed how to communicate with the Elementary inhabitants [probably theNature spirits], and these disclosed to him many other great secrets of Nature.While the philosophers in Fez were not so great as those in Damcar, the previousexperiences of C.R.C. enabled him to distinguish the true from the false andthus add greatly to his store of knowledge.After two years in Fez, C.R.C. sailed for Spain, carrying with him manytreasures, among them rare plants and animals accumulated during his wanderings.He fondly hoped that the learned men of Europe would receive with gratitude therare intellectual and material treasures which he had brought for theirconsideration. Instead he encountered only ridicule, for the so-called wise wereafraid to admit their previous ignorance lest their prestige be impaired. Atthis point in the narrative is an interpolation stating that Paracelsus, whilenot a member of the “Fraternity of the Rose Cross,” had read the book M and froma consideration of its contents had secured information which made him theforemost physician of mediaeval Europe.Tired, but not discouraged, as the result of the fruitlessness of his efforts,C.R.C. returned to Germany, where he built a house in which he could quietlycarry on his study and research. He also manufactured a number of rarescientific instruments for research purposes. While he could have made himselffamous had he cared to commercialize his knowledge, he preferred thecompanionship of God to the esteem of men.After five years of retirement he decided to renew his struggle for areformation of the arts and sciences of his day, this time with the aid of a fewtrusted friends. He sent to the cloister where his early training had beenreceived and called to himself three brethren, whom he bound by an oath topreserve inviolate the secrets he should impart and to write down for the sakeof posterity the information he should dictate. These four founded the“Fraternity of the Rose Cross.” They prepared its secret cipher language and,according to the Fama, a great dictionary in which all forms of wisdom wereclassified to the glorification of God. They also began the work of transcribingthe book M, but found the task too difficult because of the demands of the greatnumbers of sick who came to them for healing.Having completed a newer and larger building, which they called the “House ofthe Holy Spirit,” they decided to include four new members in the Fraternity,thus increasing the number to eight, seven of whom were German. All wereunmarried. Working industriously together, they speedily completed the arduouslabor of preparing the documents, instructions, and arcana of the Order. Theyalso put the house called “Sancti Spiritus” in order.They then decided to separate and visit the other countries of the earth, notonly that their wisdom might be given to others who deserved it but also thatthey might check and correct any mistakes existing in their own system. Beforeseparating, the Brethren prepared six rules, or by-laws, and each bound himselfto obey them. The first rule was that they should take to themselves no otherdignity or credit than that they were willing to heal the sick without charge.The second was that from that time on forever they should wear no special robeor garment, but should dress according to the custom of the country wherein theydwelt. The third stated that every year upon a certain day they should meet inthe “House of the Holy Spirit,” or, if unable to do so, should be represented byan epistle. The fourth decreed that each member should search for a worthyperson to succeed him at his own demise. The fifth stated that the letters“R.C.” should be their seal, mark, and character from that time onward. Thesixth specified that the Fraternity should remain unknown to the world for aperiod of one hundred years.194 [images/00195.jpg] THE CRUCIFIED ROSE.The original symbol of the Rosicrucian Fraternity was a hieroglyphic rosecrucified upon a cross. The cross was often raised upon a three-stepped Calvary.Occasionally the symbol of a cross rising from a rose was used in connectionwith their activities. The Rosicrucian rose was drawn upon the Round Table ofKing Arthur, and is the central motif for the links forming the chain from whichthe “Great George” is suspended among the jewels of The Order of the Garter.Hargrave Jennings suspects this Order of having some connection with theRosicrucians. After they had sworn to this code five of the Brothers departed to distantlands, and a year later two of the others also went their way, leaving FatherC.R.C. alone in the “House of the Holy Spirit.” Year after year they met withgreat joy, for they had quietly and sincerely promulgated their doctrines amongthe wise of the earth.When the first of the Order died in England, it was decided that the burialplaces of the members should be secret. Soon afterward Father C.R.C. called theremaining six together, and it is supposed that then he prepared his ownsymbolic tomb. The Fama records that none of the Brothers alive at the time ofits writing knew when Father C.R.C. died or where he was buried. His body wasaccidentally discovered 120 years after his death when one of the Brothers, whopossessed considerable architectural skill, decided to make some alterations inthe “House of the Holy Spirit.” [It is only suspected that the tomb was in thisbuilding.]While making his alterations, the Brother discovered a memorial tablet uponwhich were inscribed the names of the early members of the Order. This hedecided to transfer to a more imposing chapel, for at that time no one knew inwhat country Father C.R.C. had died, this information having been concealed bythe original members. In attempting to remove the memorial tablet, which washeld in place by a large nail, some stones and plastering were broken from thewall, disclosing a door concealed in the masonry. The members of the Orderimmediately cleared away the rest of the debris and uncovered the entrance to avault. Upon the door in large letters were the words: POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO.This, according to the mystic interpretation of the Brethren, meant, “In 120years I shall come forth.”The following morning the door was opened and the members entered a vault withseven sides and seven corners, each side five feet broad and eight feet high.Although the sun never penetrated this tomb, it was brilliantly illuminated by amysterious light in the ceiling. In the center was a circular altar, upon whichwere brass plates engraved with strange characters. In each of the seven sideswas a small door which, upon being opened, revealed a number of boxes filledwith books, secret instructions, and the supposedly lost arcanum of theFraternity.Upon moving the altar to one side a brass cover was disclosed. Lifting thisrevealed a body, presumably that of C.R.C., which, although it had lain there120 years, was as well preserved as though it had just been interred. It wasornamented and attired in the robes of the Order, and in one hand was clasped amysterious parchment which, next to the Bible, was the most valued possession ofthe Society. After thoroughly investigating the contents of the secret chamber,the brass plate and altar were put back in place, the door of the vault wasagain sealed, and the Brothers went their respective ways, their spirits raisedand their faith increased by the miraculous spectacle which they had beheld.The document ends by saying in effect, “In accordance with the will of FatherC.R.C., the Fama has been prepared and sent forth to the wise and learned of allEurope in five languages, that all may know and understand the secrets of theaugust Fraternity. All of sincere soul who labor for the glory of God areinvited to communicate with the Brethren and are promised that their appealshall be heard, regardless of where they are or how the messages are sent. Atthe same time, those of selfish and ulterior motives are warned that only sorrowand misery will attend any who attempt to discover the Fraternity without aclean heart and a pure mind.”Such, in brief, is the story of the Fama Fraternitatis. Those who accept itliterally regard Father C.R.C. as the actual founder of the Brotherhood, whichhe is believed to have organized about 1400. The fact that historicalcorroboration of the important points of the Fama has never been discovered isheld against this theory. There is no proof that Father C.R.C. ever approachedthe learned men of Spain. The mysterious city of Damcar cannot be found, andthere is no record that anywhere in Germany there existed a place where greatnumbers of the halt and sick came and were mysteriously healed. A. E. Waite’sThe Secret Tradition in Freemasonry contains a picture of Father C.R.C. showinghim with a long beard upon his breast, sitting before a table upon which burns acandle. One hand is supporting his head and the other is resting the tip of itsindex finger on the temple of a human skull. The picture, however, provesnothing. Father C.R.C. was never seen by other than members of his own Order,and they did not preserve a description of him. That his name was ChristianRosencreutz is most improbable, as the two were not even associated until thewriting of the Chymical Nuptials."},{"pageContent":"THE SECOND POSTULATE Those Masonic brethren who have investigated the subject accept the historicalexistence of the “Brotherhood of the Rose Cross” but are divided concerning theorigin of the Order. One group holds the society originated in mediaeval Europeas an outgrowth of alchemical speculation. Robert Macoy, 33°, believes thatJohann Valentin Andreæ, a German theologian, was the true founder, and he alsobelieves it possible that this divine merely reformed and amplified an existingsociety which had been founded by Sir Henry Cornelius Agrippa. Some believe thatRosicrucianism represented the first European invasion of Buddhist and Brahminculture. Still others hold the opinion that the “Society of the Rose Cross” wasfounded in Egypt during the philosophic supremacy of that empire, and that italso perpetuated the Mysteries of ancient Persia and Chaldea.In his Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins writes: “The Rosicrucians of Germany arequite ignorant of their origin; but, by tradition, they suppose themselvesdescendants of the ancient Egyptians, Chaldeans, Magi, and Gymnosophists.” (Thelast was a name given by the followers of Alexander the Great to a caste ofnaked Wise Men whom they found meditating along the river banks in India.) Theconsensus among these factions is that the story of Father C.R.C., like theMasonic legend of Hiram Abiff, is an allegory and should not be consideredliterally. A similar problem has confronted students of the Bible, who havefound not only difficult, but in the majority of cases impossible, their effortsto substantiate the historical interpretation of the Scriptures.Admitting the existence of the Rosicrucians as a secret society with bothphilosophic and political ends, it is remarkable that an organization withmembers in all parts of Europe could maintain absolute secrecy throughout thecenturies. Nevertheless, the “Brothers of the Rose Cross” were apparently ableto accomplish this. A great number of scholars and philosophers, among them SirFrancis Bacon and Wolfgang von Goethe, have been suspected of affiliation withthe Order, but their connection has not been established to the satisfaction ofprosaic historians. Pseudo-Rosicrucians abounded, but the true members of the“Ancient and Secret Order of The Unknown Philosophers” have successfully livedup to their name; to this day they remain unknown.During the Middle Ages a number of tracts appeared, purporting to be from thepens of Rosicrucians. Many of them, however, were spurious, being issued fortheir self-aggrandizement by unscrupulous persons who used the revered and magicname Rosicrucian in the hope of gaining religious or political power. This hasgreatly complicated the work of investigating the Society. One group ofpseudo-Rosicrucians went so far as to supply its members with a black cord bywhich they were to know each other, and warned them that if they broke their vowof secrecy the cord would be used to strangle them. Few of the principles ofRosicrucianism have been preserved in literature, for the original Fraternitypublished only fragmentary accounts of its principles and activities.In his Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, Dr. Franz Hartmann describes theFraternity as “A secret society of men possessing superhuman—if notsupernatural—powers; they were said to be able to prophesy future events, topenetrate into the deepest mysteries of Nature, to transform Iron, Copper, Lead,or Mercury into Gold, to prepare an Elixir of Life, or Universal Panacea, by theuse of which they could preserve their youth and manhood; and moreover it wasbelieved that they could command the Elemental Spirits of Nature, and knew thesecret of the Philosopher’s Stone, a substance which rendered him who possessedit all-powerful, immortal, and supremely wise.”The same author further defines a Rosicrucian as “A person who by the process ofspiritual awakening has attained a practical knowledge of the secretsignificance of the Rose and the Cross. * * * To call a person a Rosicruciandoes not make him one, nor does the act of calling a person a Christian make hima Christ. The real Rosicrucian or Mason cannot be made; he must grow to be oneby the expansion and unfoldment of the divine power within his own heart. Theinattention to this truth is the cause that many churches and secret societiesare far from being that which their names express.”The symbolic principles of Rosicrucianism are so profound that even today theyare little appreciated. Their charts and diagrams are concerned with weightycosmic principles which they treat with a philosophic understanding decidedlyrefreshing when compared with the orthodox narrowness prevalent in their day.According to the available records, the Rosicrucians were bound together bymutual aspirations rather than by the laws of a fraternity. The “Brothers of theRose Cross” are believed to have lived unobtrusively, laboring industriously intrades and professions, disclosing their secret affiliation to no one—in manycases not even to their own families. After the death of C.R.C., most of theBrethren apparently had no central meeting place. Whatever initiatory ritual theOrder possessed was so closely guarded that it has never been revealed.Doubtless it was couched in chemical terminology.195 [images/00196.jpg] THE ROSICRUCIAN ROSE.The rose is a yonic symbol associated with generation, fecundity, and purity.The fact that flowers blossom by unfolding has caused them to be chosen assymbolic of spiritual unfoldment. The red color of the rose refers to the bloodof Christ, and the golden heart concealed within the midst of the flowercorresponds to the spiritual gold concealed within the human nature. The numberof its petals being ten is also a subtle reminder of the perfect Pythagoreannumber. The rose symbolizes the heart, and the heart has always been accepted byChristians as emblematic of the virtues of love and compassion, as well as thenature of Christ—the personification of these virtues. The rose as a religiousemblem is of great antiquity. It was accepted by the Greeks as the symbol of thesunrise, or the coming of dawn. In his Metamorphosis, or Golden Ass, Apuleius,turned into a donkey because of his foolishness, regained his human shape byeating a sacred rose given him by the Egyptian priests.The presence of a hieroglyphic rose upon the escutcheon of Martin Luther hasbeen the basis of much speculation as to whether any connection existed betweenhis Reformation and the secret activities of the Brothers of the Rose Cross. Efforts to join the Order were apparently futile, for the Rosicrucians alwayschose their disciples. Having agreed on one who they believed would do honor totheir illustrious fraternity, they communicated with him in one of manymysterious ways. He might receive a letter, either anonymous or with a peculiarseal, usually bearing the letters “C.R.C.” or “R.C.” upon it. He would beinstructed to go to a certain place at an appointed time. What was disclosed tohim he never revealed, although in many cases his later writings showed that anew influence had come into his life, deepening his understanding and broadeninghis intellect. A few have written allegorically concerning what they beheld whenin the august presence of the “Brethren of the Rose Cross.”Alchemists were sometimes visited in their laboratories by mysterious strangers,who delivered learned discourses concerning the secret processes of the Hermeticarts and, after disclosing certain processes, departed, leaving no trace. Othersdeclared that the “Brothers of the Rose Cross” communicated with them throughdreams and visions, revealing the secrets of Hermetic wisdom to them while theywere asleep. Having been instructed, the candidate was bound to secrecy not onlyconcerning the chemical formulae which had been disclosed to him but alsoconcerning the method by which he had secured them. While these nameless adeptswere suspected of being “Brothers of the Rose Cross,” it could never be provedwho they were, and those visited could only conjecture.Many suspect the Rosicrucian rose to be a conventionalization of the Egyptianand Hindu lotus blossom, with the same symbolic meaning as this more ancientsymbol. The Divine Comedy stamps Dante Alighieri as being familiar with thetheory of Rosicrucianism. Concerning this point, Albert Pike in his Morals andDogma makes this significant statement: “His Hell is but a negative Purgatory.His heaven is composed of a series of Kabalistic circles, divided by a cross,like the Pantacle of Ezekiel. In the center of this cross blooms a rose, and wesee the symbol of the Adepts of the Rose-Croix for the first time publiclyexpounded and almost categorically explained.”Doubt has always existed as to whether the name Rosicrucian came from the symbolof the rose and cross, or whether this was merely a blind to deceive theuninformed and further conceal the true meaning of the Order. Godfrey Higginsbelieves that the word Rosicrucian is not derived from the flower but from theword Ros, which means dew. It is also interesting to note that the word Rasmeans wisdom, while Rus is translated concealment. Doubtless all of thesemeanings have contributed to Rosicrucian symbolism.A. E. Waite holds with Godfrey Higgins that the process of forming thePhilosopher’s Stone with the aid of dew is the secret concealed within the nameRosicrucian. It is possible that the dew referred to is a mysterious substancewithin the human brain, closely resembling the description given by alchemistsof the dew which, falling from heaven, redeemed the earth. The cross is symbolicof the human body, and the two symbols together—the rose on the cross—signifythat the soul of man is crucified upon the body, where it is held by threenails.It is probable that Rosicrucian symbolism is a perpetuation of the secret tenetsof the Egyptian Hermes, and that the Society of Unknown Philosophers is the truelink connecting modern Masonry, with its mass of symbols, to ancient EgyptianHermeticism, the source of that symbolism. In his Doctrine and Literature of theKabalah, A. E. Waite makes this important observation: “There are certainindications which point to a possible connection between Masonry andRosicrucianism, and this, if admitted, would constitute the first link in itsconnection with the past. The evidence is, however, inconclusive, or at leastunex- tricated. Freemasonry per se, in spite of the affinity with mysticismwhich I have just mentioned, has never exhibited any mystic character, nor hasit a clear notion how it came by its symbols.”Many of those connected with the development of Freemasonry were suspected ofbeing Rosicrucians; some, as in the case of Robert Fludd, even wrote defenses ofthis organization. Frank C. Higgins, a modern Masonic symbolist, writes: “DoctorAshmole, a member of this fraternity [Rosicrucian], is revered by Masons as oneof the founders of the first Grand Lodge in London.” (See Ancient Freemasonry.)Elias Ashmole is but one of many intellectual links connecting Rosicrucianismwith the genesis of Freemasonry. The Encyclopœdia Britannica notes that EliasAshmole was initiated into the Freemasonic Order in 1646, and further statesthat he was “the first gentleman, or amateur, to be ‘accepted’.”On this same subject, Papus, in his Tarot of the Bohemians, has written: “Wemust not forget that the Rosicrucians were the Initiators of Leibnitz, and thefounders of actual Freemasonry through Ashmole.” If the founders of Freemasonrywere initiated into the Great Arcanum of Egypt—and the symbolism of modernMasonry would indicate that such was the case—then it is reasonable to supposethat they secured their information from a society whose existence they admittedand which was duly qualified to teach them these symbols and allegories.One theory concerning the two Orders is to the effect that Freemasonry was anoutgrowth of Rosicrucianism; in other words, that the “Unknown Philosophers”became known through an organization which they created to serve them in thematerial world. The story goes on to relate that the Rosicrucian adepts becamedissatisfied with their progeny and silently withdrew from the Masonichierarchy, leaving behind their symbolism and allegories, but carrying away thekeys by which the locked symbols could be made to give up their secret meanings.Speculators have gone so far as to state that, in their opinion, modernFreemasonry has completely absorbed Rosicrucianism and succeeded it as theworld’s greatest secret society. Other minds of equal learning declare that theRosicrucian Brotherhood still exists, preserving its individuality as the resultof having withdrawn from the Masonic Order.According to a widely accepted tradition, the headquarters of the RosicrucianOrder is near Carlsbad, in Austria (see Doctor Franz Hartmann). Another versionhas it that a mysterious school, resembling in general principles theRosicrucian Fraternity, which calls itself “The Bohemian Brothers,” stillmaintains its individuality in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) of Germany. Onething is certain: with the rise of Freemasonry, the Rosicrucian Order in Europepractically disappeared, and notwithstanding existing statements to thecontrary, it is certain that the 18th degree (commonly known as the Rose-Croix)perpetuates many of the symbols of the Rosicrucian Fire Alchemists.In an anonymous unpublished manuscript of the eighteenth century bearing theearmarks of Rosicrucian Qabbalism appears this statement: “Yet will I now givethe over-wise world a paradox to be solved, namely, that some illuminated menhave undertaken to found Schools of Wisdom in Europe and these for some peculiarreason have called themselves Fratres Rosæ Crucis. But soon afterwards camefalse schools into existence and corrupted the good intentions of these wisemen. Therefore, the Order no longer exists as most people would understandexistence, and as this Fraternity of the Seculo Fili call themselves Brothers ofthe Rosie Cross, so also will they in the Seculo Spiritus Sancti call themselvesBrothers of the Lily Cross and the Knights of the White Lion. Then will theSchools of Wisdom begin again to blossom, but why the first one chose their nameand why the others shall also choose theirs, only those can solve who haveunderstanding grounded in Nature.”Political aspirations of the Rosicrucians were expressed through the activitiesof Sir Francis Bacon, the Comte de St.-Germain, and the Comte di Cagliostro. Thelast named is suspected of having been an emissary of the Knights Templars, asociety deeply involved in transcendentalism, as Eliphas Levi has noted. Thereis a popular supposition to the effect that the Rosicrucians were at leastpartial instigators of the French Revolution. (Note particularly theintroduction to Lord Bulwer-Lytton’s Rosicrucian novel Zanoni.)"},{"pageContent":"THE THIRD POSTULATE The third theory takes the form of a sweeping denial of Rosicrucianism,asserting that the so-called original Order never had any foundation in fact butwas entirely a product of imagination. This viewpoint is best expressed by anumber of questions which are still being asked by investigators of this elusivegroup of metaphysicians. Was the “Brotherhood of the Rose Cross” merely amythical institution created in the fertile mind of some literary cynic for thepurpose of deriding the alchemical and Hermetic sciences? Did the “House of theHoly Spirit” ever exist outside the imagination of some mediaeval mystic? Wasthe whole Rosicrucian story a satire to ridicule the gullibility of scholasticEurope? Was the mysterious Father C.R.C. a product of the literary genius ofJohann Valentin Andreæ, or another of similar mind, who, attempting to scorealchemical and Hermetic philosophy, unwittingly became a great power infurthering the cause of its promulgation? That at least one of the earlydocuments of the Rosicrucians was from the pen of Andreæ there is little doubt,but for just what purpose he compiled it still remains a matter of speculation.Did Andreæ himself receive from some unknown person, or persons, instructions tobe carried out? If he wrote the Chymical Nuptials of Christian Rosencreutz whenonly fifteen years old, was he overshadowed in the preparation of that book?To these vital questions no answers are forthcoming. A number of personsaccepted the magnificent imposture of Andreæ as absolute truth. It is maintainedby many that, as a consequence, numerous psuedo-societies sprang up, eachasserting that it was the organization concerning which the Fama Fraternitatisand the Confessio Fraternitatis were written. Beyond doubt there are manyspurious orders in existence today; but few of them can offer valid claims thattheir history dates back farther than the beginning of the nineteenth century.The mystery associated with the Rosicrucian Fraternity has resulted in endlesscontroversy. Many able minds, notable among them Eugenius Philalethes, MichaelMaier, John Heydon, and Robert Fludd, defended the concrete existence of “TheSociety of Unknown Philosophers.” Others equally qualified have asserted it tobe of fraudulent origin and doubtful existence. Eugenius Philalethes, whilededicating books to the Order, and himself writing an extended exposition of itsprinciples, disclaims all personal connection with it. Many others have donelikewise.Some are of the opinion that Sir Francis Bacon had a hand in the writing of theFama and Confessio Fraternitatis, on the basis that the rhetorical style ofthese works is similar to that of Bacon’s New Atlantis. They also contend thatcertain statements in the latter work point to an acquaintance with Rosicruciansymbology. The elusiveness of the Rosicrucians has caused them to be favoritesubjects for literary works. Outstanding among the romances which have beenwoven around them is Zanoni. The author, Lord Bulwer-Lytton, is regarded by someas a member of the Order, while others assert that he applied for membership butwas rejected. Pope’s Rape of the Lock, the Comte de Gabalis by Abbé de Villars,and essays by De Quincey, Hartmann, Jennings, Mackenzie, and others, areexamples of Rosicrucian literature. Although the existence of these mediaevalRosicrucians is difficult to prove, sufficient evidence is at hand to make itextremely probable that there existed in Germany, and afterwards in France,Italy, England, and other European countries, a secret society of illuminatedsavants who made contributions of great import to the sum of human knowledge,while maintaining absolute secrecy concerning their personalities and theirorganization."},{"pageContent":"THE FOURTH POSTULATE The apparent incongruities of the Rosicrucian controversy have also beenaccounted for by a purely transcendental explanation. There is evidence thatearly writers were acquainted with such a supposition—which, however, waspopularized only after it had been espoused by Theosophy. This theory assertsthat the Rosicrucians actually possessed all the supernatural powers with whichthey were credited; that they were in reality citizens of two worlds: that,while they had physical bodies for expression on the material plane, they werealso capable, through the instructions they received from the Brotherhood, offunctioning in a mysterious ethereal body not subject to the limitations of timeor distance. By means of this “astral form” they were able to function in theinvisible realm of Nature, and in this realm, beyond reach of the profane, theirtemple was located.According to this viewpoint, the true Rosicrucian Brotherhood consisted of alimited number of highly developed adepts, or initiates, those of the higherdegrees being no longer subject to the laws of mortality; candidates wereaccepted into the Order only after long periods of probation; adepts possessedthe secret of the Philosopher’s Stone and knew the process of transmuting thebase metals into gold, but taught that these were only allegorical termsconcealing the true mystery of human regeneration through the transmutation ofthe “base elements” of man’s lower nature into the “gold” of intellectual andspiritual realization. According to this theory, those who have sought to recordthe events of importance in connection with the Rosicrucian controversy haveinvariably failed because they approached their subject from a purely physicalor materialistic angle.These adepts were believed to have been able to teach man how to function awayfrom his physical body at will by assisting him to remove the “rose from thecross.” They taught that the spiritual nature was attached to the material format certain points, symbolized by the “nails” of the crucifixion; but by threealchemical initiations which took place in the spiritual world, in the trueTemple of the Rose Cross, they were able to “draw” these nails and permit thedivine nature of man to come down from its cross. They concealed the processesby which this was accomplished under three alchemical metaphoric expressions:“The Casting of the Molten Sea,” “The Making of the Rose Diamond,” and “TheAchieving of the Philosopher’s Stone.”While the intellectualist flounders among contradictory theories, the mystictreats the problem in an entirely different manner. He believes that the trueRosicrucian Fraternity, consisting of a school of supermen (not unlike thefabled Mahatmas of India), is an institution existing not in the visible worldbut in its spiritual counterpart, which he sees fit to call the “inner planes ofNature”; that the Brothers can be reached only by those who are capable oftranscending the limitations of the material world. To substantiate theirviewpoint, these mystics cite the following significant statement from theConfessio Fraternitatis: “A thousand times the unworthy may clamour, a thousandtimes may present themselves, yet God hath commanded our ears that they shouldhear none of them, and hath so compassed us about with His clouds that unto us,His servants, no violence can be done; wherefore now no longer are we beheld byhuman eyes, unless they have received strength borrowed from the eagle.” Inmysticism the eagle is a symbol of initiation (the spinal Spirit Fire), and bythis is explained the inability of the unregenerated world to understand theSecret Order of the Rose Cross.Those professing this theory regard the Comte de St.-Germain as their highestadept and assert that he and Christian Rosencreutz were one and the sameindividual. They accept fire as their universal symbol because it was the oneelement by means of which they could control the metals. They declaredthemselves the descendants of Tubal-cain and Hiram Abiff, and that the purposeof their existence was to preserve the spiritual nature of man through ages ofmateriality. “The Gnostic sects, the Arabs, Alchemists, Templars, Rosicrucians,and lastly the Freemasons, form the Western chain in the transmission of occultscience.” (See The Tarot of the Bohemians translated by A. E. Waite from theFrench of Papus.)Max Heindel, the Christian mystic, described the Rosicrucian Temple as an“etheric structure” located in and around the home of a European countrygentleman. He believed that this invisible building would ultimately be moved tothe American continent. Mr. Heindel referred to the Rosicrucian Initiates as soadvanced in the science of life that “death had forgotten them.”"},{"pageContent":"XXXII Rosicrucian Doctrines and Tenets Trustworthy information is unavailable concerning the actual philosophicalbeliefs, political aspirations, and humanitarian activities of the RosicrucianFraternity. Today, as of old, the mysteries of the Society are preservedinviolate by virtue of their essential nature; and attempts to interpretRosicrucian philosophy are but speculations, anything to the contrarynotwithstanding.Evidence points to the probable existence of two distinct Rosicrucian bodies: aninner organization whose members never revealed their identity or teachings tothe world, and an outer body under the supervision of the inner group. In allprobability, the symbolic tomb of Christian Rosencreutz, Knight of the GoldenStone, was in reality this outer body, the spirit of which is in a more exaltedsphere. For a period of more than a century subsequent to 1614, the outer bodycirculated tracts and manifestoes under either its own name or the names ofvarious initiated members. The purpose of these writings was apparently toconfuse and mislead investigators, and thus effectively to conceal the actualdesigns of the Fraternity.When Rosicrucianism became the philosophical “fad” of the seventeenth century,numerous documents on the subject were also circulated for purely commercialpurposes by impostors desirous of capitalizing its popularity. The cunninglycontrived artifices of the Fraternity itself and the blundering literaryimpostures of charlatans formed a double veil behind which the innerorganization carried on its activities in a manner totally dissimilar to itspurposes and principles as publicly disseminated. The Fratres Rosœ Crucisnaïvely refer to the misunderstandings which they have for obvious reasonspermitted to exist concerning themselves as being “clouds” within which theylabor and behind which they are concealed.An inkling of the substance of Rosicrucianism—its esoteric doctrines—can begleaned from an analysis of its shadow—its exoteric writings. In one of the mostimportant of their “clouds,” the Confessio Fraternitatis, the Brethren of theFraternity of R.C. seek to justify their existence and explain (?) the purposesand activities of their Order. In its original form the Confessio is dividedinto fourteen chapters, which are here epitomized."},{"pageContent":"CONFESSIO FRATERNITATIS R.C. AD ERUDITOS EUROPÆ Chapter I. Do not through hasty judgment or prejudice misinterpret thestatements concerning our Fraternity published in our previous manifesto—theFama Fraternitatis. Jehovah, beholding the decadence of civilization, seeks toredeem humanity by revealing to the willing and by thrusting upon the reluctantthose secrets which previously He had reserved for His elect. By this wisdom thegodly shall be saved, but the sorrows of the ungodly shall be multiplied. Whilethe true purpose of our Order was set forth in the Fama Fraternitatis,misunderstandings have arisen through which we have been falsely accused ofheresy and treason. In this document we hope so to clarify our position that thelearned of Europe will be moved to join with us in the dissemination of divineknowledge according to the will of our illustrious founder.Chapter II. While it is alleged by many that the philosophic code of our day issound, we declare it to be false and soon to die of its own inherent weakness.Just as Nature, however, provides a remedy for each new disease that manifestsitself, so our Fraternity has provided a remedy for the infirmities of theworld’s philosophic system. The secret philosophy of the R.C. is founded uponthat knowledge which is the sum and head of all faculties, sciences, and arts.By our divinely revealed system—which partakes much of theology and medicine butlittle of jurisprudence—we analyze the heavens and the earth; but mostly westudy man himself, within whose nature is concealed the supreme secret. If thelearned of our day will accept our invitation and join themselves to ourFraternity, we will reveal to them undreamed-of secrets and wonders concerningthe hidden workings of Nature.Chapter III. Do not believe that the secrets discussed in this brief documentare lightly esteemed by us. We cannot describe fully the marvels of ourFraternity lest the uninformed be overwhelmed by our astonishing declarationsand the vulgar ridicule the mysteries which they do not comprehend. We also fearthat many will be confused by the unexpected generosity of our proclamation, fornot understanding the wonders of this sixth age they do not realize the greatchanges which are to come. Like blind men living in a world full of light, theydiscern only through the sense of feeling. [By sight is implied spiritualcognition: by feeling, the material senses.]Chapter IV. We firmly believe that through deep meditation on the inventions ofthe human mind and the mysteries of life, through the cooperation of the angelsand spirits, and through experience and long observation, our loving ChristianFather C.R.C. was so fully illumined with God’s wisdom that were all the booksand writings of the world lost and the foundations of science overturned, theFraternity of R.C. could reestablish the structure of world thought upon thefoundation of divine truth and integrity. Because of the great depth andperfection of our knowledge, those desiring to understand the mysteries of theFraternity of R.C. cannot attain to that wisdom immediately, but must grow inunderstanding and knowledge. Therefore, our Fraternity is divided into gradesthrough which each must ascend step by step to the Great Arcanum. Now that ithas pleased God to lighten unto us His sixth candelabrum, is it not better toseek truth in this way than to wander through the labyrinths of worldlyignorance?Furthermore, those who receive this knowledge shall become masters of all artsand crafts; no secret shall be hidden from them; and all good works of the past,present, and future shall be accessible to them. The whole world shall become asone book and the contradictions of science and theology shall be reconciled.Rejoice, O humanity! for the time has come when God has decreed that the numberof our Fraternity shall be increased, a labor that we have joyously undertaken.The doors of wisdom are now open to the world, but only to those who have earnedthe privilege may the Brothers present themselves, for it is forbidden to revealour knowledge even to our own children. The right to receive spiritual truthcannot be inherited: it must be evolved within the soul of man himself.Chapter V. Though we may be accused of indiscretion in offering our treasures sofreely and promiscuously—without discriminating between the godly, the wise, theprince, the peasant—we affirm that we have not betrayed our trust; for althoughwe have published our Fama in five languages, only those understand it who havethat right. Our Society is not to be discovered by curiosity seekers, but onlyby serious and consecrated thinkers; nevertheless we have circulated our Fama infive mother tongues so that the righteous of all nations may have an opportunityto know of us, even though they be not scholars. A thousand times the unworthymay present themselves and clamor at the gates, but God has forbidden us of theFraternity of R.C. to hear their voices, and He has surrounded us with Hisclouds and His protection so that no harm may come to us, and God has decreedthat we of the Order of R.C. can no longer be seen by mortal eyes unless theyhave received strength borrowed from the eagle. We further affirm that we shallreform the governments of Europe and pattern them according to the systemapplied by the philosophers of Damcar. All men desirous of securing knowledgeshall receive as much as they are capable of understanding. The rule of falsetheology shall be overthrown and God shall make His will known through Hischosen philosophers.Chapter VI. Because of the need of brevity, it is enough to say that our FatherC.R.C. was born in the year 1378 and departed at the age of 106, leaving to usthe labor of spreading the doctrine of philosophic religion to the entire world.Our Fraternity is open to all who sincerely seek for truth; but we publicly warnthe false and impious that they cannot betray or injure us, for God hasprotected our Fraternity, and all who seek to do it harm shall have their evildesigns return and destroy them, while the treasures of our Fraternity shallremain untouched, to be used by the Lion in the establishment of his kingdom.Chapter VII. We declare that God, before the end of the world, shall create agreat flood of spiritual light to alleviate the sufferings of humankind.Falsehood and darkness which have crept into the arts, sciences, religions, andgovernments of humanity—making it difficult for even the wise to discover thepath of reality—shall be forever removed and a single standard established, sothat all may enjoy the fruitage of truth. We shall not be recognized as thoseresponsible for this change, for people shall say that it is the result of theprogressiveness of the age. Great are the reforms about to take place; but we ofthe Fraternity of R.C. do not arrogate to ourselves the glory for this divinereformation, since many there are, not members of our Fraternity but honest,true and wise men, who by their intelligence and their writings shall hasten itscoming. We testify that sooner the stones shall rise up and offer their servicesthan that there shall be any lack of righteous persons to execute the will ofGod upon earth.Chapter VIII. That no one may doubt, we declare that God has sent messengers andsigns in the heavens, namely, the new stars in Serpentarius and Cygnus, to showthat a great Council of the Elect is to take place. This proves that God revealsin visible nature—for the discerning few—signs and symbols of all things thatare coming to pass. God has given man two eyes, two nostrils, and two ears, butonly one tongue. Whereas the eyes, the nostrils, and the ears admit the wisdomof Nature into the mind, the tongue alone may give it forth. In various agesthere have been illumined ones who have seen, smelt, tasted, or heard the willof God, but it will shortly come to pass that those who have seen, smelt,tasted, or heard shall speak, and truth shall be revealed. Before thisrevelation of righteousness is possible, however, the world must sleep away theintoxication of her poisoned chalice (filled with the false life of thetheological vine) and, opening her heart to virtue and understanding, welcomethe rising sun of Truth.Chapter IX. We have a magic writing, copied from that divine alphabet with whichGod writes His will upon the face of celestial and terrestrial Nature. With thisnew language we read God’s will for all His creatures, and just as astronomerspredict eclipses so we prognosticate the obscurations of the church and how longthey shall last. Our language is like unto that of Adam and Enoch before theFall, and though we understand and can explain our mysteries in this our sacredlanguage, we cannot do so in Latin, a tongue contaminated by the confusion ofBabylon.Chapter X. Although there are still certain powerful persons who oppose andhinder us—because of which we must remain concealed—we exhort those who wouldbecome of our Fraternity to study unceasingly the Sacred Scriptures, for such asdo this cannot be far from us. We do not mean that the Bible should becontinually in the mouth of man, but that he should search for its true andeternal meaning, which is seldom discovered by theologians, scientists, ormathematicians because they are blinded by the opinions of their sects. We bearwitness that never since the beginning of the world has there been given to mana more excellent book than the Holy Bible. Blessed is he who possesses it, moreblessed he who reads it, most blessed he who understands it, and most godlike hewho obeys it.Chapter XI. We wish the statements we made in the Fama Fraternitatis concerningthe transmutation of metals and the universal medicine to be rightly understood.While we realize that both these works are attainable by man, we fear that manyreally great minds may be led away from the true quest of knowledge andunderstanding if they permit themselves to limit their investigation to thetransmutation of metals. When to a man is given power to heal disease, toovercome poverty, and to reach a position of worldly dignity, that man is besetby numerous temptations and unless he possess true knowledge and fullunderstanding he will become a terrible menace to mankind. The alchemist whoattains to the art of transmuting base metals can do all manner of evil unlesshis understanding be as great as his self-created wealth. We therefore affirmthat man must first gain knowledge, virtue, and understanding; then all otherthings may be added unto him. We accuse the Christian Church of the great sin ofpossessing power and using it unwisely; therefore we prophesy that it shall fallby the weight of its own iniquities and its crown shall be brought to naught.Chapter XII. In concluding our Confessio, we earnestly admonish you to castaside the worthless books of pseudo-alchemists and philosophers (of whom thereare many in our age), who make light of the Holy Trinity and deceive thecredulous with meaningless enigmas. One of the greatest of these is a stageplayer, a man with sufficient ingenuity for imposition. Such men are mingled bythe Enemy of human welfare among those who seek to do good, thus making Truthmore difficult of discovery. Believe us, Truth is simple and unconcealed, whilefalsehood is complex, deeply hidden, proud, and its fictitious worldlyknowledge, seemingly aglitter with godly luster, is often mistaken for divinewisdom. You that are wise will turn from these false teachings and come to us,who seek not your money but freely offer you our greater treasure. We desire notyour goods, but that you should become partakers of our goods. We do not derideparables, but invite you to understand all parables and all secrets. We do notask you to receive us, but invite you to come unto our kingly homes and palaces,not because of ourselves but because we are so ordered by the Spirit of God, thedesire of our most excellent Father C.R.C., and the need of the present moment,which is very great.Chapter XIII. Now that we have made our position clear: that we sincerelyconfess Christ; disavow the Papacy; devote our lives to true philosophy andworthy living; and daily invite and admit into our Fraternity the worthy of allnations, who thereafter share with us the Light of God: will you not joinyourselves with us to the perfection of yourselves, the development of all thearts, and the service of the world? If you will take this step, the treasures ofevery part of the earth shall be at one time given unto you, and the darknesswhich envelopes human knowledge and which results in the vanities of materialarts and sciences shall be forever dispelled.Chapter XIV. Again we warn those who are dazzled by the glitter of gold or thosewho, now upright, might be turned by great riches to a life of idleness andpomp, not to disturb our sacred silence with their clamorings; for though therebe a medicine which will cure all diseases and give unto all men wisdom, yet itis against the will of God that men should attain to understanding by any meansother than virtue, labor, and integrity. We are not permitted to manifestourselves to any man except it be by the will of God. Those who believe thatthey can partake of our spiritual wealth against the will of God or without Hissanction will find that they shall sooner lose their lives in seeking us thanattain happiness by finding us."},{"pageContent":"FRATERNITAS R.C. Johann Valentin Andreæ is generally reputed to be the author of the Confessio.It is a much-mooted question, however, whether Andreæ did not permit his name tobe used as a pseudonym by Sir Francis Bacon. Apropos of this subject are twoextremely significant references occurring in the introduction to thatremarkable potpourri, The Anatomy of Melancholy. This volume first appeared in1621 from the pen of Democritus Junior, who was afterwards identified as RobertBurton, who, in turn, was a suspected intimate of Sir Francis Bacon. Onereference archly suggests that at the time of publishing The Anatomy ofMelancholy in 1621 the founder of the Fraternity of R.C. was still alive. Thisstatement—concealed from general recognition by its textual involvement—hasescaped the notice of most students of Rosicrucianism. In the same work therealso appears a short footnote of stupendous import. It contains merely thewords: “Joh. Valent. Andreas, Lord Verulam.” This single line definitely relatesJohann Valentin Andreæ to Sir Francis Bacon, who was Lord Verulam, and by itspunctuation intimates that they are one and the same individual.196 [images/00197.jpg] THE ALCHEMICAL ANDROGYNE.The Turbæ Philosophorum is one of the earliest known documents on alchemy in theLatin tongue. Its exact origin is unknown. It is sometimes referred to as TheThird Pythagorical Synod. As its name implies, it is an assembly of the sagesand sets forth the alchemical viewpoints of many of the early Greekphilosophers. The symbol reproduced above is from a rare edition of the TurbæPhilosophorum published in Germany in 1750, and represents by a hermaphroditicfigure the accomplishment of the magnum opus. The active and passive principlesof Nature were often depicted by male and female figures, and when these twoprinciples were harmoniously conjoined in any one nature or body it wascustomary to symbolize this state of perfect equilibrium by the composite figureabove shown.Prominent among Rosicrucian apologists was John Heydon, who inscribes himself “AServant of God, and a Secretary of Nature.” In his curious work, The Rosie CrossUncovered, he gives an enigmatic but valuable description of the Fraternity ofR.C. in the following language:“Now there are a kind of men, as they themselves report, named Rosie Crucians, adivine fraternity that inhabit the suburbs of heaven, and these are the officersof the Generalissimo of the world, that are as the eyes and ears of the greatKing, seeing and hearing all things: they say these Rosie Crucians areseraphically illuminated, as Moses was, according to this order of the elements,earth refin’d to water, water to air, air to fire.” He further declares thatthese mysterious Brethren possessed polymorphous powers, appearing in anydesired form at will. In the preface of the same work, he enumerates the strangepowers of the Rosicrucian adepts:“I shall here tell you what Rosie Crucians are, and that Moses was their Father,and he was Θ∈o πας; some say they were of the order of Elias, some say theDisciples of Ezekiel; * * * For it should seem Rosie Crucians were not onlyinitiated into the Mosaical Theory, but have arrived also to the power ofworking miracles, as Moses, Elias, Ezekiel, and the succeeding Prophets did, asbeing transported where they please, as Habakkuk was from Jewry to Babylon, oras Philip, after he had baptized the Eunuch to Azorus, and one of these wentfrom me to a friend of mine in Devonshire, and came and brought me an answer toLondon the same day, which is four days journey; they taught me excellentpredictions of Astrology and Earthquakes; they slack the Plague in Cities; theysilence the violent Winds and Tempests; they calm the rage of the Sea andRivers; they walk in the Air, they frustrate the malicious aspects of Witches;they cure all Diseases.”The writings of John Heydon are considered a most important contribution toRosicrucian literature. John Heydon was probably related to Sir Christo- pherHeydon, “a Seraphically Illuminated Rosie Crucian,” whom the late F. LeighGardner, Hon. Secretary Soc. Ros. in Anglia, believes to have been the source ofhis Rosicrucian knowledge. In his Bibliotheca Rosicruciana he makes thefollowing statement concerning John Heydon: “On the whole, from the internalevidence of his writings, he appears to have gone through the lower grade of theR.C. Order and to have given out much of this to the world.” John Heydontraveled extensively, visiting Arabia, Egypt, Persia, and various parts ofEurope, as related in a biographical introduction to his work, The Wise-MansCrown, Set with Angels, Planets, Metals, etc., or The Glory of the Rosie Cross—awork declared by him to be a translation into English of the mysterious book Mbrought from Arabia by Christian Rosencreutz.Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes), another champion of the Order,corroborates the statement of John Heydon concerning the ability of theRosicrucian initiates to make themselves invisible at will: “The Fraternity ofR.C. can move in this white mist. ‘Whosoever would communicate with us must beable to see in this light, or us he will never see—unless by our own will.’”The Fraternity of R.C. is an august and sovereign body, arbitrarily manipulatingthe symbols of alchemy, Qabbalism, astrology, and magic to the attainment of itsown peculiar purposes, but entirely independent of the cults whose terminologyit employs. The three major objects of the Fraternity are:> 1. The abolition all monarchical forms of government and the substitution> therefor of the rulership of the philosophic elect. The present democracies> are the direct outgrowth of Rosicrucian efforts to liberate the masses from> the domination of despotism. In the early part of the eighteenth century the> Rosicrucians turned their attention to the new American Colonies, then forming> the nucleus of a great nation in the New World. The American War of> Independence represents their first great political experiment and resulted in> the establishment of a national government founded upon the fundamental> principles of divine and natural law. As an imperishable reminder of their sub> rosa activities, the Rosicrucians left the Great Seal of the United States.> The Rosicrucians were also the instigators of the French Revolution, but in> this instance were not wholly successful, owing to the fact that the> fanaticism of the revolutionists could not be controlled and the Reign of> Terror ensued.> 2. The reformation of science, philosophy, and ethics. The Rosicrucians> declared that the material arts and sciences were but shadows of the divine> wisdom, and that only by penetrating the innermost recesses of Nature could> man attain to reality and understanding. Though calling themselves Christians,> the Rosicrucians were evidently Platonists and also profoundly versed in the> deepest mysteries of early Hebrew and Hindu theology. There is undeniable> evidence that the Rosicrucians desired to reestablish the institutions of the> ancient Mysteries as the foremost method of instructing humanity in the secret> and eternal doctrine. Indeed, being in all probability the perpetuators of the> ancient Mysteries, the Rosicrucians were able to maintain themselves against> the obliterating forces of dogmatic Christianity only by absolute secrecy and> the subtlety of their subterfuges. They so carefully guarded and preserved the> Supreme Mystery—the identity and interrelationship of the Three Selves—that no> one to whom they did not of their own accord reveal themselves has ever> secured any satisfactory information regarding either the existence or the> purpose of the Order. The Fraternity of R.C., through its outer organization,> is gradually creating an environment or body in which the Illustrious Brother> C.R.C. may ultimately incarnate and consummate for humanity the vast spiritual> and material labors of the Fraternity.> 3. The discovery of the Universal Medicine, or panacea, for all forms of> disease. There is ample evidence that the Rosicrucians were successful in> their quest for the Elixir of Life. In his Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum,> Elias Ashmole states that the Rosicrucians were not appreciated in England,> but were welcomed on the Continent. He also states that Queen Elizabeth was> twice cured of the smallpox by the Brethren of the Rosy Cross, and that the> Earl of Norfolk was healed of leprosy by a Rosicrucian physician. In the> quotations that follow it is hinted by John Heydon that the Brothers of the> Fraternity possessed the secret of prolonging human existence indefinitely,> but not beyond the time appointed by the will of God:“And at last they could restore by the same course every Brother that died tolife again, and so continue many ages; the rules you find in the fourth book. ** * After this manner began the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, first by fourpersons, who died and rose again until Christ, and then they came to worship asthe Star guided them to Bethlehem of Judea, where lay our Saviour in hismother’s arms; and then they opened their treasure and presented unto him gifts,gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and by the commandment of God went home to theirhabitation. These four waxing young again successively many hundreds of years,made a magical language and writing, with a large dictionary, which we yet dailyuse to God’s praise and glory, and do find great wisdom therein. * * * Nowwhilst Brother C.R. was in a proper womb quickening, they concluded to draw andreceive yet others more into their Fraternity.”The womb herein referred to was apparently the glass casket, or container, inwhich the Brothers were buried. This was also called the philosophical egg.After a certain period of time the philosopher, breaking the shell of his egg,came forth and functioned for a prescribed period, after which he retired againinto his shell of glass. The Rosicrucian medicine for the healing of all humaninfirmities may be interpreted either as a chemical substance which produces thephysical effects described or as spiritual understanding—the true healing powerwhich, when a man has partaken of it, reveals truth to him. Ignorance is theworst form of disease, and that which heals ignorance is therefore the mostpotent of all medicines. The perfect Rosicrucian medicine was for the healing ofnations, races, and individuals.In an early unpublished manuscript, an unknown philosopher declares alchemy,Qabbalism, astrology, and magic to have been divine sciences originally, butthat through perversion they had become false doctrines, leading seekers afterwisdom ever farther from their goal. The same author gives a valuable key toesoteric Rosicrucianism by dividing the path of spiritual attainment into threesteps, or schools, which he calls mountains. The first and lowest of thesemountains is Mount Sophia; the second, Mount Qabbalah; and the third, MountMagia. These three mountains are sequential stages of spiritual growth. Theunknown author then states:“By philosophy is to be understood the knowledge of the workings of Nature, bywhich knowledge man learns to climb to those higher mountains above thelimitations of sense. By Qabbalism is to be understood the language of theangelic or celestial beings, and he who masters it is able to converse with themessengers of God. On the highest of the mountains is the School of Magia(Divine Magic, which is the language of God) wherein man is taught the truenature of all things by God Himself.”There is a growing conviction that if the true nature of Rosicrucianism weredivulged, it would cause consternation, to say the least. Rosicrucian symbolshave many meanings, but the Rosicrucian meaning has not yet been revealed. Themount upon which stands the House of the Rosy Cross is still concealed byclouds, in which the Brethren hide both themselves and their secrets. MichaelMaier writes: “What is contained in the Fama and Confessio is true. It is a verychildish objection that the brotherhood have promised so much and performed solittle. With them, as elsewhere, many are called but few are chosen. The mastersof the order hold out the rose as the remote prize, but they impose the cross onthose who are entering.” (See Silentium post Clamores, by Maier, and TheRosicrucians and the Freemasons, by De Quincey.)The rose and the cross appear upon the stained glass windows of LichfieldChapter House, where Walter Conrad Arensberg believes Lord Bacon and his motherto have been buried. A crucified rose within a heart is watermarked into thededication page of the 1628 edition of Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy.The fundamental symbols of the Rosicrucians were the rose and the cross; therose female and the cross male, both universal phallic emblems. While suchlearned gentlemen as Thomas Inman, Hargrave Jennings, and Richard Payne Knighthave truly observed that the rose and the cross typify the generative processes,these scholars seem unable to pierce the veil of symbolism; they do not realizethat the creative mystery in the material world is merely a shadow of the divinecreative mystery in the spiritual world. Because of the phallic significance oftheir symbols, both the Rosicrucians and the Templars have been falsely accusedof practicing obscene rites in their secret cremonials. While it is quite truethat the alchemical retort symbolizes the womb, it also has a far moresignificant meaning concealed under the allegory of the second birth. Asgeneration is the key to material existence, it is natural that the Fraternityof R.C. should adopt as its characteristic symbols those exemplifying thereproductive processes. As regeneration is the key to spiritual existence, theytherefore founded their symbolism upon the rose and the cross, which typify theredemption of man through the union of his lower temporal nature with his highereternal nature. The rosy cross is also a hieroglyphic figure representing theformula of the Universal Medicine."},{"pageContent":"XXXIII Fifteen Rosicrucian and Qabbalistic Diagrams In his well-known work, The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries, HargraveJennings reproduces five Qabbalistic charts which he declares to be genuineRosicrucian drawings. He gives no information concerning their origin nor doeshe attempt an elucidation of their symbolism. A recent writer who reproduced oneof these charts correlated it to the emblematic tomb of Father C.R.C., thusexposing the true nature of Christian Rosencreutz.The five plates reproduced in Hargrave Jennings’ book are part of a series offifteen diagrams which appear in The Magical, Qabbalistical, and TheosophicalWritings of Georgius von Welling, on the Subject of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.This extremely rare volume was published at Frankfort and Leipzig in 1735 and1760. The numbers and figures on the charts refer to the chapters and sectionsof the Writings. These fifteen charts constitute a remarkable and invaluableaddition to the few other known admittedly authentic Qabbalistic and Rosicruciandiagrams.Lucifer is the greatest mystery of symbolism. The secret knowledge of theRosicrucians concerning Lucifer is nowhere so plainly set forth as in theseplates, which virtually reveal his true identity, a carefully guarded secretabout which little has been written. Lucifer is represented by the number 741.Von Welling does not give a complete exposition of the fifteen charts; to havedone so would have been contrary to the principles of Qabbalistic philosophy.The deeper significance of the symbols is revealed only by profound study andcontemplation.Table I, Figures 1-11. Figure 1 is a Ptolemaic chart showing the truerelationship existing between the primordial elements. Its secret significanceis as follows: The outer ring enclosed by the lines A and B is the region ofSchamayim, a Qabbalistic name for the Supreme Deity, signifying the expanse ofthe heavens, or a spiritual fiery water. Schamayim is “The Ocean of Spirit,”within which all created and uncreated things exist and by the life of whichthey are animated. In the lower worlds Schamayim becomes the astral light.197 [images/00198.jpg] TABLE I, FIGURES 1-11.The space between B and C marks the orbits or planes of the seven SpiritualIntelligences called the Divine Planets (not the visible planets). According tothe Mysteries, the souls of men enter the lower worlds through ring B, the fixedstars. All creation reflects the glory of Schamayim, the energy that filtersinto the spheres of the elements through the windows of the stars and planets.Between C and D lies the region of the subtle, spiritual air, a subdivision ofether. D to E marks the surface of the earth and sea, by which are also meantgrades of ether. E to F marks the lower region, called “The Gathering of theWaters and the Production of the Virgin Earth,” or “Ares.” The alchemists calledthis “quicksand,” the true mystic foundation of the solid earth. F to G marksthe circle of the subterranean air, which is more dense and coarse than that inthe outer space, C to D. In this denser atmosphere the stellar influences andcelestial impulses are crystallized into corporeal spirits, thus forming themultitude of forms which exist without knowledge of their own fiery source. G isthe region of the central fire of the element earth, a coarse fire incontradistinction to the divine fiery Schamayim. The sphere of the starryheavens likewise has its opposite in the sphere of the subterranean air; and thesphere of the upper air (or subtle vaporous water) has its opposite in thesphere E to F. The focal point, D to E, between the three higher and the threelower spheres, is called “The Reservoir.” It receives impressions from both thesuperior and the inferior regions and is common to both.Figure 2 is the Qabbalistic symbol of elemental water; Figure 9 represents thespiritual invisible water. Figure 3 is the Qabbalistic symbol of elemental air;Figure 7 represents the spiritual and invisible air. Figure 4 is the Qabbalisticsign of the elemental earth; Figure 8 represents the spiritual and invisibleearth. Figure 5 is the Qabbalistic sign of the elemental fire; Figure 6represents the spiritual and invisible fire. Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 symbolizethe four elements before the descent of Lucifer. They are the four rivers spokenof in Genesis, having their source in the one river, Figure 10, which representsthe elements superimposed on one another. The golden ball in the center isSchamayim, the fiery source of all elements. Figure 11 is the emblem of thebeginning and the end of all creatures. From it all things proceed and to it allmust return again, to become one with the fiery water of divine understanding.Table II, Figures 12-51. Figures 12, 13, 14 demonstrate the sphere as a symbolof motion to be emblematic of fire, water, and air; and the cube as a symbol ofweight to be emblematic of earth. The sphere rests upon a point, the cube upon asurface; the sphere is therefore used to symbolize spirit, and the cube, matter.Figure 14 demonstrates that atmosphere rushing in behind a falling objectincreases its velocity and apparently adds to its weight. The essential natureof each element is occultly signified by the peculiar symbol and characterassigned to it.Of Figure 15, the symbol of salt, von Welling writes, in substance: The cube hassix sides, corresponding to the six days of creation, with the point of rest(the seventh day) in the center of the cube. On each surface of the cube appearthe signs of the four elements [triangles]. The alchemists declared that saltwas the first created substance produced by the fire (Schamayim) which flowedout of God. In salt all creation is concentrated; in salt are the beginning andend of all things. The cube, furthermore, is composed of twelve bodies, each ofwhich has six sides. These bodies are the twelve fundamental pillars of the trueinvisible church, and when these twelve bodies are multiplied by their six sidesthe magical number 72 results. The wise have said that nothing is perfect untilit has been dissolved, separated, and again united so that it becomes a bodycomposed of twelve bodies, like the cube. The cube also consists of six pyramidswith the six surfaces of the cube as their bases. The points of these sixpyramids meet at the center of the cube. These six pyramids, each consisting offour triangles, signify the elements, and produce the magical number 24, whichrefers to the Elders before the Throne. The six surfaces and the pointconstitute the magical number 7. If 7 be multiplied by 7 and the product by 7again, and so on 7 times, the answer will reveal the method used by the ancientsfor measuring the periods of eternity; thus: (1) 7 x 7 = 49; (2) 49 × 7 = 343;(3) 343 × 7 = 2,401; (4) 2,401 × 7 = 16,807; (5) 16,807 × 7 = 117,649; (6)117,649 × 7 = 823,543; (7) 823,543 × 7 = 5,764,801. (This is not to be taken asearth years or times.) The 5,000,000 represents the great hall year; the 700,000the great Sabbath year, wherein all human beings gradually gain trueunderstanding and become heirs to their original and eternal inheritance, whichwas lost when they were enmeshed in the lower elements. The 64,800 is the numberof the fallen angels, and the last one year signifies the liberation of Luciferand return to his original estate.198 [images/00199.jpg] TABLE II, FIGURES 12-51. Figure 16 is another symbol of salt, while Figure 17 (the dot) is the sign ofspirit, gold, the sun, or the germ of life. If the dot be moved before itself itbecomes a line, Figure 18. This motion of the dot is the first motion. Thebeginning and end of every line is a dot. Figure 19 is the circle. It is thesecond motion and the most perfect of all lines. Out of it are formed allfigures and bodies imaginable. Figure 20 represents the outpouring of the upperand spiritual life into manifestation. Figure 21 represents darkness, for it isthe loosening of the sub-terrene destructive principle. Figure 20 is also thesymbol of day, and Figure 21 of night.Figure 22 is a symbol of water; Figure 23 is the complete universal character oflight and darkness. The upright triangle represents Schamayim; the invertedtriangle the dark earth which imprisons the infernal subterranean fire. It is“The First Day of Creation,” or the time of the separation of Schamayim andAres. Figure 24 represents the six days of creation and proves that the elementsare an outflow of the Divine Fire which, breaking up, becomes the substances ofthe tangible universe, as signified in Figure 25.Figure 26 is the character of the air, showing that air is born out of theEternal Light and the ethereal water. Figure 27 is the character of water. It isthe inversion of Figure 26, indicating that its origin is from the lower fireand not the higher. Its upper part signifies that water does not lack the Divineelement, but as a universal mirror reflects the heavenly influences. Figures 28and 29 are symbols of salt, showing that it is both fire and water in one.Figure 30 is the character of fire in all its attributes, and Figure 31 (thesame inverted), water in all its powers. Figure 32 is the character of salt inall its attributes. Figure 33 represents both gold and the sun. Their essentialnatures are identical, being formed from the first fire out of Schamayim. Theyare perfect, as can be seen from their symbol, for no more perfect form can beproduced out of the dot than the circle.Figure 34 is the character of the greater and lesser worlds; as the dot issurrounded by its circumference, this world is surrounded by Schamayim. Man (theLittle World) is included in this symbol because his inner nature is potentialgold (Aphar Min Haadamah), which gold is his eternal indestructible spiritualbody. Gold is the masculine principle of the universe.Figure 35 is the character of silver and the moon. It signifies that silver(like gold) is a perfect metal, except that the red part of its nature is turnedinward. Silver is the feminine principle of the universe.Figure 36 is the character of copper and Venus; Figure 37, of iron and Mars;Figure 38, of tin and Jupiter; Figure 39, of lead and Saturn; Figure 40, ofMercury (both the planet and the element); Figure 41, of antimony, the key metalof the earth itself; Figure 42, of arsenic; Figure 43, of sulphur; Figure 44, ofcinnabar; Figure 45 of quicklime; Figure 46, of nitre; and Figure 47, ofvitriol. Figure 48 is the character of sal ammoniac, which element derives itsname from the Temple of Jupiter Ammon in an Egyptian desert, where it was found.Figure 49 is the char-acter of alum; Figure 50, of alkali, a name of Arabianorigin; and Figure 51, of sal tartar, a substance possessing great occultvirtue.199 [images/00200.jpg] TABLE III, FIGURE 52. Table III, Figure 52. The eight globes and the central square represent theseven days of creation. The three worlds wherein creation occurs are symbolizedby three concentric rings. The German words in the outer ring are extracts fromthe first chapter of Genesis. The words around the outside of the outer ring areThe First Day. The four small globes inside the outer ring deal with theabstract phases of creation. The upper globe containing the triangle enclosesthe words Heaven and Earth. The globe to the right contains the word Light, andthe one to the left, Jehovah Elohim in the upper part and Darkness in the lowerpart. The globe at the bottom contains the word Day in the upper half and Nightin the lower.The four globes within the second ring depict the second, third, fourth, andfifth days of creation. The white globe above divided by a dotted line isdesignated The Second Day; the globe to the left with the mountains, The ThirdDay; the globe to the right with the planetary rings, The Fourth Day; and theglobe below bisected by a dotted line, The Fifth Day. The square in the centralring containing the human form is marked The Sixth Day. This chart is adiagrammatic exposition of the three layers of the macrocosmic and microcosmicauric eggs, showing the forces active within them.Table IV, Figure 53. Figure 53 has been designated the symbolic tomb ofChristian Rosencreutz. The upper circle is the first world—the Divine Sphere ofGod. The triangle in the center is the throne of God. The small circles at thepoints of the star symbolize the seven great Spirits before the throne,mentioned in the Book of Revelation, in the midst of which walks the Alpha andOmega—the Son of God. The central triangle contains three flames—the DivineTrinity. From the lowest of these flames proceeds the first divine outflow,shown by two parallel lines descending through the throne of Saturn (the SpiritOrifelis, through whom God manifested Himself). Passing through the boundary ofthe celestial universe and the 22 spheres of the lower system, the lines end atpoint B, the throne of Lucifer, in whom the divine outpouring is concentratedand reflected. From him the divine light irradiates in succession to d(Capricorn), e (Gemini), f (Libra), g (Taurus), h (Pisces), i (Aquarius), k(Cancer), l (Virgo), m (Aries), n (Leo), o (Scorpio), p (Sagittarius), thenceback to d. The zodiacal circles represent twelve orders of great and beneficentSpirits, and the smaller circles within the ring of fixed stars mark the orbitsof the sacred planets.200 [images/00201.jpg] TABLE IV, FIGURE 53.201 [images/00202.jpg] TABLE V, FIGURE 54.202 [images/00203.jpg] TABLE VI, FIGURES 55-59.203 [images/00204.jpg] TABLE VII, FIGURES 1-5, 7, AND 8. Table V, Figure 54. Figure 54 is similar to Figure 53, but represents theuniverse at the time God manifested Himself through the character ofJupiter, theSpirit Sachasiel. Von Welling gives no reason for the change in the order ofinflux into the twelve orders of spirits, for the third world, for the adding ofanother circle and the interlaced triangles in the upper world, or for theletters Y and Z. In the upper triangle, A represents the Father Principle, F thedivine outflow, G the point of influx into the twelve orders of spirits(probably Sagittarius). The letters H, I, J, K, L, M, N, 0, P, Q R, S, and Tdenote the sequential points of irradiations to each other; W and X, the Worldof the Sons of God; and B, C, D, and E, the World of Lucifer. This plate showsthe universe after the descent of Lucifer into matter. According to von Welling,when Lucifer wanted to control power, the influx of the divine light instantlyceased. Lucifer’s world (which later became the solar system), with all itslegions of spirits (who in their essence were Schamayim) reflecting his ideasand inverting the divine light, was turned into darkness. Lucifer’s Schamayimthereupon became a contracted disc, a tangible substance; and Chaos came intoexistence.Table VI, Figures 55-59. Figure 55 symbolizes the Chaos of Lucifer; Figure 56,the separation of light from darkness; Figure 57, the light in the midst of thedarkness; and Figure 58, the regions of the elements and their inhabitants. Thefour A’s signify the Abyss surrounding all things. The A B is the fiery throneof Lucifer. The plane of g is the subterranean air; f, the subterranean water;c, the earth region; d, the outer water; e, the outer air; W and X the region ofSchamayim. The elemental inhabitants of the planes differ in goodness accordingto their proximity to the center of wickedness; (A B). The earth’s surface (c)divides the subterranean elementals from those of the outer water, air, and fire(d, e, and X). The elementals of the upper strata (the upper half of c, and allof a, e, and X) represent an ascending scale of virtue, while those of the lowerstrata (the lower half of c, and all of f, g, and A B) represent a descendingscale of depravity.204 [images/00205.jpg] TABLE VIII, FIGURE 6. The region of air (e) is a partial exception to this order. While air is closeto the light and filled with beautiful spirits, it is also the habitation ofBeelzebub, the Evil Spirit of the air, with his legion of elemental demons. Uponthe subtle element of air are impressed the influences of the stars; thethoughts, words, and deeds of man; and a myriad of mysterious influences fromthe various planes of Nature. Man inhales these impressions, and they producediverse effects upon his mind. In air are suspended also the seed germs by whichwater is impregnated and made capable of bringing forth forms of organic andinorganic life. The grotesque figures seen in crystal caves and frost picturesupon windows are caused by these aerial impressions. While the air elementalsare great and wise, they are treacherous and confused because amenable to bothgood and evil impressions. The mighty elemental beings who inhabit the waterylight fire of the region X cannot be deceived by the spirits of darkness. Theylove the creatures of the waters, for the watery element (d) proceeded from thefiery water (X). Mortal man cannot endure the society of these fiery spirits,but gains wisdom from them through the creatures of the waters in which theycontinually mirror themselves. Figure 59 represents this solar system, with Wand X as the locality of the Garden of Eden.205 [images/00206.jpg] TABLE X, FIGURES 10-15. Table VII, Figures 1-5, 7, 8. (Table VIII has Figure 6.) Figure 1 is the triunedivine sulphur, the All-Perfect out of the All-Perfect, the Soul of creatures.The threefold Divine One is symbolized by three interlaced circles designatedalchemically salt, sulphur, and mercury. In the central triangle is the divinename Ehieh. Geist means spirit. The other words require no translation. Figure 2is common destructive sulphur. A bar placed in the triangle makes it thecharacter of earth. Figure 3 is true oil of vitriol, composed of a circle withtwo diameters and two reversed half-circles hanging below. In this are hiddenthe characters of all metals. Tin is symbolized by Figure 4 and iron by Figure5. Figure 7 is the solar system according to Copernicus. Figure 8 is the lastjudgment. The sun is removed from the center of the solar system and replaced bythe earth. This changes the respective positions of all the other planets exceptMars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which retain their respective circles. The letter asignifies the circle of the sun; b, that of Mercury; c, that of Venus; d, (sic)that of the moon; and E, that of the earth.

In Figure 6 the letter a marks the center of eternity. Themotion of the rays toward b, d, and c was the first divine manifestation and issymbolized by the equilateral triangle, b, d, c. The eternal world within theinner circle became manifest in the water (salt), the light (mercury), and thefire (sulphur) of the archetypal world, represented by the three circles (f, e,g) within the triangle of complete equality (h, i, k), which is in turnsurrounded by the circle of the high throne. The circle f is namedunderstanding; e, wisdom; g, reason. In circle i is the word Father; in circleh, Son; in circle k, Spirit. The seven outer circles are the seven spiritsbefore the throne. The lower part of the figure is similar to Figures 53 and 54.The outer circles are the angelic world ending in the cognizable world of theSons of God. Then comes the circle of the visible constellations and fixedstars; within this is the solar system with the sun as the center (l). Ungrundmeans the Abyss.Table IX, Figure 9. Figure 9 is a synthesis of the Old and New Testaments andrepresents the interblending planes of being. In the right margin the sevenouter circles contain the names of the planetary angels. The words in thegraduated circles from the top triangle downward read: (1) Abyss of Compassion;(2) Zion; (3) The New Heaven and the New Earth; (4) The New Jerusalem; (5)Paradise; (6) The Bosom of Abraham; (7) The Outer Courts of the Lord. From belowthe circles of darkness reach upward, each divine principle being opposed by aninfernal opposite. The small circle on the left containing a triangle and crossis named The Tree of Life, and that on the right The Tree of the Knowledge ofGood and Evil. In the center of the diagram is the Trinity, joined with thesuperior and inferior planes by lines of activity.Table X, Figures 10-15.

Is the idea one at whichthe learned of the modern world can afford to scoff? Alchemy was more than aspeculative art: it was also an operative art. Since the time of the immortalHermes, alchemists have asserted (and not without substantiating evidence) thatthey could manufacture gold from tin, silver, lead, and mercury. That the galaxyof brilliant philosophic and scientific minds who, over a period of two thousandyears, affirmed the actuality of metallic transmutation and multiplication,could be completely sane and rational on all other problems of philosophy andscience, yet hopelessly mistaken on this one point, is untenable. Nor is itreasonable that the hundreds declaring to have seen and performed transmutationsof metals could all have been dupes, inbeciles, or liars.Those assuming that all alchemists were of unsound mentality would be forced toput in this category nearly all the philosophers and scientists of the ancientand mediaeval worlds. Emperors, princes, priests, and common towns-folk havewitnessed the apparent miracle of metallic metamorphosis. In the face ofexisting testimony, anyone is privileged to remain unconvinced, but the scofferelects to ignore evidence worthy of respectful consideration. Many greatalchemists and Hermetic philosophers occupy an honored niche in the Hall ofFame, while their multitudinous critics remain obscure. To list all thesesincere seekers after Nature’s great arcanum is impossible, but a few willsuffice to acquaint the reader with the superior types of intellect whointerested themselves in this abstruse subject.Among the more prominent names are those of Thomas Norton, Isaac of Holland,Basil Valentine (the supposed discoverer of antimony), Jean de Meung, RogerBacon, Albertus Magnus, Quercetanus Gerber (the Arabian who brought theknowledge of alchemy to Europe through his writings), Paracelsus, NicholasFlammel, John Frederick Helvetius, Raymond Lully, Alexander Sethon, MichaelSendivogius, Count Bernard of Treviso, Sir George Ripley, Picus de Mirandola,John Dee, Henry Khunrath, Michael Maier, Thomas Vaughan, J. B. von Helmont, JohnHeydon, Lascaris, Thomas Charnock, Synesius (Bishop of Ptolemais), Morieu, theComte di Cagliostro, and the Comte de St.-Germain. There are legends to theeffect that King Solomon and Pythagoras were alchemists and that the formermanufactured by alchemical means the gold used in his temple.212 [images/00213.jpg] PARACELSUS.In his Biographia Antiqua, Francis Barrett appends to the name of Paracelsus thefollowng titles of distinction: “The Prince of Physicians and Philosophers byFire; Grand Paradoxical Physician; The Trismegistus of Switzerland; FirstReformer of Chymical Philosophy; Adept in Alchymy, Cabala, and Magic; Nature’sFaithful Secretary; Master of the Elixir of Life and The Philosopher’s Stone,”and the “Great Monarch of Chymical Secrets.”Albert Pike takes sides with the alchemical philosopher by declaring that thegold of the Hermetists was a reality. He says: “The Hermetic Science, like allthe real sciences, is mathematically demonstrable. Its results, even material,are as rigorous as that of a correct equation. The Hermetic Gold is not only atrue dogma, a light without Shadow, a Truth without alloy of falsehood; it isalso a material gold, real, pure, the most precious that can be found in themines of the earth.” So much for the Masonic angle.William and Mary jointly ascended the throne of England in 1689, at which timealchemists must have abounded in the kingdom, for during the first year of theirreign they repealed an Act made by King Henry IV in which that sovereigndeclared the multiplying of metals to be a crime against the crown. In Dr. Sig-mund Bacstrom’s Collection of Alchemical Manuscripts is a handwritten copy ofthe Act passed by William and Mary, copied from Chapter 30 of Statutes at Largefor the first year of their reign. The Act reads as follows: “An Act to repealthe Statute made in the 5th year of King Henry IV, late king of England,[wherein] it was enacted, among other things, in these words, or to this effect,namely: ‘that none from henceforth should use to multiply Gold or Silver or usethe craft of multiplication, and if any the same do they shall incur the pain offelony.’ And whereas, since the making of the said statute, divers persons haveby their study, industry and learning, arrived to great skill & perfection inthe art of melting and refining of metals, and otherwise improving andmultiplying them and their ores, which very much abound in this realm, andextracting gold and silver out of the same, but dare not to exercise their saidskill within this realm, for fear of falling under the penalty of the saidstatute, but exercise the said art in foreign parts, to the great loss anddetriment of this realm: Be it therefore enacted by the King’s and Queen’s mostexcellent Majesties, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritualand temporal and Commons in this present parliament assembled, that fromhenceforth the aforesaid branch, article, or sentence, contained in the saidact, and every word, matter and thing contained in the said branch or sentence,shall be repealed, annulled, revoked, and for ever made void, any thing in thesaid act to the contrary in any wise whatsoever notwithstanding. Providedalways, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all the gold andsilver that shall be extracted by the aforesaid art of melting or refining ofmetals, and otherwise improving and multiplying of them and their ores, asbefore set forth, be from henceforth employed for no other use or useswhatsoever but for the increase of monies; and that the place hereby appointedfor the disposal thereof shall be their Majesties mint, within the Tower ofLondon, at which place they are to receive the full and true value of their goldand silver, so procured, from time to time, according to the assay and finenessthereof, and so for any greater or less weight, and that none of that metal ofgold and silver so refined and procured be permitted to be used or disposed ofin any other place or places within their Majesties dominions.” After thisrepealing measure had become effective, William and Mary encouraged the furtherstudy of alchemy.Dr. Franz Hartmann has collected reliable evidence concerning four differentalchemists who transmuted base metals into gold not once but many times. One ofthese accounts concerns a monk of the Order of St. Augustine named WenzelSeiler, who discovered a small amount of mysterious red powder in his convent.In the presence of Emperor Leopold I, King of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia, hetransmuted quantities of tin into gold. Among other things which he dipped intohis mysterious essence was a large silver medal. That part of the medal whichcame in contact with the gold-producing substance was transmuted into the purestquality of the more precious metal. The rest remained silver. With regard tothis medal, Dr. Hartmann writes:“The most indisputable proof (if appearances can prove anything) of thepossibility of transmuting base metals into gold, may be seen by everyone whovisits Vienna; it being a medal preserved in the Imperial treasury chamber, andit is stated that this medal, consisting originally of silver, has been partlytransformed into gold, by alchemical means, by the same Wenzel Seiler who wasafterwards made a knight by the Emperor Leopold I. and given the title Wenzes-laus Ritter von Reinburg.” (In the Pronaos of the Temple of Wisdom.)Space limitations preclude a lengthy discussion of the alchemists. A briefsketch of the lives of four should serve to show the general principles on whichthey worked, the method by which they obtained their knowledge, and the usewhich they made of it. These four were Grand Masters of this secret science; andthe stories of their wanderings and strivings, as recorded by their own pens andby contemporaneous disciples of the Hermetic art, are as fascinating as anyromance of fiction."},{"pageContent":"PARACELSUS OF HOHENHEIM The most famous of alchemical and Hermetic philosophers was Philippus AureolusTheophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. This man, who called himself Paracelsus,declared that some day all the doctors of Europe would turn from the otherschools and, following him, revere him above every other physician. The accepteddate of the birth of Paracelsus is December 17, 1493. He was an only child. Bothhis father and mother were interested in medicine and chemistry. His father wasa physician and his mother the superintendent of a hospital. While still ayouth, Paracelsus became greatly interested in the writings of Isaac of Holland,and determined to reform the medical science of his day.When twenty years old he began a series of travels which continued for abouttwelve years. He visited many European countries, including Russia. It ispossible that he penetrated into Asia. It was in Constantinople that the greatsecret of the Hermetic arts was bestowed upon him by Arabian adepts. Hisknowledge of the Nature spirits and the inhabitants of the invisible worlds heprobably secured from the Brahmins of India with whom he came in contact eitherdirectly or through their disciples. He became an army physician, and hisunderstanding and skill brought him great success.Upon his return to Germany, he began his long-dreamed-of reformation of themedical arts and sciences. He was opposed on every hand and criticizedunmercifully. His violent temper and tremendously strong personality undoubtedlyprecipitated many storms upon his head which might have been avoided had he beenof a less caustic disposition. He flayed the apothecaries, asserting that theydid not use the proper ingredients in their prescriptions and did not considerthe needs of their patients, desiring only to collect exorbitant fees for theirconcoctions.The remarkable cures which Paracelsus effected only made his enemies hate himmore bitterly, for they could not duplicate the apparent miracles which hewrought. He not only treated the more common diseases of his day but is said tohave actually cured leprosy, cholera, and cancer. His friends claimed for himthat he all but raised the dead. His systems of healing were so heterodox,however, that slowly but surely his enemies overwhelmed him and again and againforced him to leave the fields of his labors and seek refuge where he was notknown.There is much controversy concerning the personality of Paracelsus. That he hadan irascible disposition there is no doubt. His hatred for physicians and forwomen amounted to a mania; for them he had nothing but abuse. As far as can belearned, there was never a love affair in his life. His peculiar appearance andimmoderate system of living were always held against him by his adversaries. Itis believed that his physical abnormalities may have been responsible for muchof the bitterness against society which he carried with him throughout all hisintolerant and tempestuous life.His reputed intemperance brought upon him still more persecution, for it wasasserted that even during the time of his professorship in the University ofBasel he was seldom sober. Such an accusation is difficult to understand in viewof the marvelous mental clarity for which he was noted at all times. The vastamount of writing which he accomplished (the Strassburg Edition of his collectedworks is in three large volumes, each containing several hundred pages) is amonumental contradiction of the tales regarding his excessive use of alcoholics.No doubt many of the vices of which he is accused were sheer inventions by hisenemies, who, not satisfied with hiring assassins to murder him, sought tobesmirch his memory after they had revengefully ended his life. The manner inwhich Paracelsus met his death is uncertain, but the most credible account isthat he died as the indirect result of a scuffle with a number of assassins whohad been hired by some of his professional enemies to make away with the one whohad exposed their chicanery.Few manuscripts are extant in the handwriting of Paracelsus, for he dictated themajority of his works to his disciples, who wrote them down. Professor JohnMaxson Stillman, of Stanford University, pays the following tribute to hismemory: “Whatever be the final judgment as to the relative importance ofParacelsus in the upbuilding of medical science and practice, it must berecognized that he entered upon his career at Basel with the zeal and theself-assurance of one who believed himself inspired with a great truth, anddestined to effect a great advance in the science and practice of medicine. Bynature he was a keen and open-minded observer of whatever came under hisobservation, though probably also not a very critical analyst of the observedphenomena. He was evidently an unusually self-reliant and independent thinker,though the degree of originality in his thought may be a matter of legitimatedifferences of opinion. Certainly once having, from whatever combination ofinfluences, made up his mind to reject the sacredness of the authority ofAristotle, Galen and Avicenna, and having found what to his mind was asatisfactory substitute for the ancient dogmas in his own modification of theneo-Platonic philosophy, he did not hesitate to burn his ships behind him.“Having cut loose from the dominant Galenism of his time, he determined topreach and teach that the basis of the medical science of the future should bethe study of nature, observation of the patient, experiment and experience, andnot the infallible dogmas of authors long dead. Doubtless in the pride andself-confidence of his youthful enthusiasm he did not rightly estimate thetremendous force of conservatism against which he directed his assaults. If so,his experience in Basel surely undeceived him. From that time on he was to be awanderer again, sometimes in great poverty, sometimes in moderate comfort, butmanifestly disillusioned as to the immediate success of his campaign thoughnever in doubt as to its ultimate success—for to his mind his new theories andpractice of medicine were at one with the forces of nature, which were theexpression of God’s will, and eventually they must prevail.”213 [images/00214.jpg] ALBERTUS MAGNUS.Albert de Groot was born about 1206 and died at the age of 74. It has been saidof him that he was “magnus in magia, major in philosophia, maximus intheologia.” He was a member of the Dominican order and the mentor of St. ThomasAquinas in alchemy and philosophy. Among other positions of dignity occupied byAlbertus Magnus was that of Bishop of Regensburg. He was beatified in 1622.Albertus was an Aristotelian philosopher, an astrologer, and a profound studentof medicine and physics. During his youth, he was considered of deficientmentality, but his sincere service and devotion were rewarded by a vision inwhich the Virgin Mary appeared to him and bestowed upon him great philosophicaland intellectual powers. Having become master of the magical sciences, Albertusbegan the construction of a curious automaton, which he invested with the powersof speech and thought. The Android, as it was called, was composed of metals andunknown substances chosen according to the stars and endowed with spiritualqualities by magical formulæ and invocations, and the labor upon it consumedover thirty years. St. Thomas Aquinas, thinking the device to be a diabolicalmechanism, destroyed it, thus frustrating the labor of a lifetime. In spite ofthis act, Albertus Magnus left to St. Thomas Aquinas his alchemical formulæ,including (according to legend) the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone.On one occasion Albertus Magnus invited William II, Count of Holland and King ofthe Romans, to a garden party in midwinter. The ground was covered with snow,but Albertus had prepared a sumptuous banquet in the open grounds of hismonastery at Cologne. The guests were amazed at the imprudence of thephilosopher, but as they sat down to eat Albertus uttered a few words, and thesnow disappeared, the garden was filled with flowers and singing birds, and theair was warm with the breezes of summer. As soon as the feast was over, the snowreturned, much to the amazement of the assembled nobles. (For details, see TheLives of Alchemystical Philosophers.) This strange man, his nature a mass of contradictions, his stupendous geniusshining like a star through the philosophic and scientific darkness of mediaevalEurope, struggling against the jealousy of his colleagues as well as against theirascibility of his own nature, fought for the good of the many against thedomination of the few. He was the first man to write scientific books in thelanguage of the common people so that all could read them.Even in death Paracelsus found no rest. Again and again his bones were dug upand reinterred in another place. The slab of marble over his grave bears thefollowing inscription: “Here lies buried Philip Theophrastus the famous Doctorof Medicine who cured Wounds, Leprosy, Gout, Dropsy and other incurable Maladiesof the Body, with wonderful Knowledge and gave his Goods to be divided anddistributed to the Poor. In the Year 1541 on the 24th day of September heexchanged Life for Death. To the Living Peace, to the Sepulchred Eternal Rest.”A. M. Stoddart, in her Life of Paracelsus, gives a remarkable testimonial of thelove which the masses had for the great physician. Referring to his tomb, shewrites: “To this day the poor pray there. Hohenheim’s memory has ‘blossomed inthe dust’ to sainthood, for the poor have canonized him. When cholera threatenedSalzburg in 1830, the people made a pilgrimage to his monument and prayed him toavert it from their homes. The dreaded scourge passed away from them and ragedin Germany and the rest of Austria.” It was supposed that one early teacher ofParacelsus was a mysterious alchemist who called himself Solomon Trismosin.Concerning this person nothing is known save that after some years of wanderinghe secured the formula of transmutation and claimed to have made vast amounts ofgold. A beautifully illuminated manuscript of this author, dated 1582 and calledSplendor Solis, is in the British Museum. Trismosin claimed to have lived to theage of 150 as the result of his knowledge of alchemy. One very significantstatement appears in his Alchemical Wanderings, which work is supposed tonarrate his search for the Philosopher’s Stone: “Study what thou art, whereofthou art a part, what thou knowest of this art, this is really what thou art.All that is without thee also is within, thus wrote Trismosin.”"},{"pageContent":"RAYMOND LULLY This most famous of all the Spanish alchemists was born about the year 1235. Hisfather was seneschal to James the First of Aragon, and young Raymond was broughtup in the court surrounded by the temptations and profligacy abounding in suchplaces. He was later appointed to the position which his father had occupied. Awealthy marriage ensured Raymond’s financial position, and he lived the life ofa grandee.One of the most beautiful women at the court of Aragon was Donna AmbrosiaEleanora Di Castello, whose virtue and beauty had brought her great renown. Shewas at that time married and was not particularly pleased to discover that youngLully was rapidly developing a passion for her. Wherever she went Raymondfollowed, and at last over a trivial incident he wrote some very amorous versesto her, which produced an effect quite different from what he had expected. Hereceived a message inviting him to visit the lady. He responded with alacrity.She told him that it was only fair that he should behold more of the beautyconcerning which he wrote such appealing poems and, drawing aside part of hergarments, disclosed that one side of her body was nearly eaten away by a cancer.Raymond never recovered from the shock. It turned the entire course of his life.He renounced the frivolities of the court and became a recluse.Some time afterwards while doing penance for his worldly sins a vision appearedto him in which Christ told him to follow in the direction in which He shouldlead. Later the vision was repeated. Hesitating no longer, Raymond divided hisproperty among his family and retired to a hut on the side of a hill, where hedevoted himself to the study of Arabic, that he might go forth and convert theinfidels. After six years in this retreat he set out with a Mohammedan servant,who, when he learned that Raymond was about to attack the faith of his people,buried his knife in his master’s back. Raymond refused to allow his would-beassassin to be executed, but later the man strangled himself in prison.When Raymond regained his health he became a teacher of the Arabic language tothose who intended traveling in the Holy Land. It was while so engaged that hecame in contact with Arnold of Villa Nova, who taught him the principles ofalchemy. As a result of this training, Raymond learned the secret of thetransmutation and multiplication of metals. His life of wandering continued, andduring the course of it he arrived at Tunis, where he began to debate with theMohammedan teachers, and nearly lost his life as the result of his fanaticalattacks upon their religion. He was ordered to leave the country and never toreturn again upon pain of death. Notwithstanding their threats he made a secondvisit to Tunis, but the inhabitants instead of killing him merely deported himto Italy.An unsigned article appearing in Household Words, No. 273, a magazine conductedby Charles Dickens, throws considerable light on Lully’s alchemical ability.“Whilst at Vienna he [Lully] received flattering letters from Edward the Second,King of England, and from Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, entreating him tovisit them. He had also, in the course of his travels, met with John Cremer,Abbot of Westminster, with whom he formed a strong friendship; and it was moreto please him than the king, that Raymond consented to go to England. [A tractby John Cremer appears in the Hermetic Museum, but there is no record in theannals of Westminster of anyone by that name.] Cremer had an intense desire tolearn the last great secret of alchemy—to make the powder of transmutation—andRaymond, with all his friendship, had never disclosed it. Cremer, however, setto work very cunningly; he was not long in discovering the object that wasnearest to Raymond’s heart—the conversion of the infidels. He told the kingwonderful stories of the gold Lully had the art to make; and he worked uponRaymond by the hope that King Edward would be easily induced to raise a crusadeagainst the Mahommedans, if he had the means.“Raymond had appealed so often to popes and kings that he had lost all faith inthem; nevertheless, as a last hope, he accompanied his friend Cremer to England.Cremer lodged him in his abbey, treating him with distinction; and there Lullyat last instructed him in the powder, the secret of which Cremer had so longdesired to know. When the powder was perfected, Cremer presented him to theking, who received him as a man may be supposed to receive one who could givehim boundless riches. Raymond made only one condition; that the gold he madeshould not be expended upon the luxuries of the court or upon a war with anyChristian king; and that Edward himself should go in person with an army againstthe infidels. Edward promised everything and anything.“Raymond had apartments assigned him in the Tower, and there he tells us hetransmuted fifty thousand pounds weight of quicksilver, lead, and tin into puregold, which was coined at the mint into six million of nobles, each worth aboutthree pounds sterling at the present day. Some of the pieces said to have beencoined out of this gold are still to be found in antiquarian collections. [Whiledesperate attempts have been made to disprove these statements, the evidence isstill about equally divided.] To Robert Bruce he sent a little work entitled Ofthe Art of Transmuting Metals. Dr. Edmund Dickenson relates that when thecloister which Raymond occupied at Westminster was removed, the workmen foundsome of the powder, with which they enriched themselves.“During Lully’s residence in England, he became the friend of Roger Bacon.Nothing, of course, could be further from King Edward’s thoughts than to go on acrusade. Raymond’s apartments in the Tower were only an honorable prison; and hesoon perceived how matters were. He declared that Edward would meet with nothingbut misfortune and misery for his breach of faith. He made his escape fromEngland in 1315, and set off once more to preach to the infidels. He was now avery old man, and none of his friends could ever hope to see his face again.“He went first to Egypt, then to Jerusalem, and thence to Tunis a third time.There he at last met with the martyrdom he had so often braved. The people fellupon him and stoned him. Some Genoese merchants carried away his body, in whichthey discerned some feeble signs of life. They carried him on board theirvessel; but, though he lingered awhile, he died as they came in sight ofMajorca, on the 28th of June, 1315 at the age of eighty-one. He was buried withgreat honour in his family chapel at St. Ulma, the viceroy and all the principalnobility attending.”"},{"pageContent":"NICHOLAS FLAMMEL In the latter part of the fourteenth century there lived in Paris one whosebusiness was that of illuminating manuscripts and preparing deeds and documents.To Nicholas Flammel the world is indebted for its knowledge of a most remarkablevolume, which he bought for a paltry sum from some bookdealer with whom hisprofession of scrivener brought him in contact. The story of this curiousdocument, called the Book of Abraham the Jew, is best narrated in his own wordsas preserved in his Hieroglyphical Figures: “Whilst therefore, I NicholasFlammel, Notary, after the decease of my parents, got my living at our art ofwriting, by making inventories, dressing accounts, and summing up the expensesof tutors and pupils, there fell into my hands for the sum of two florins, aguilded book, very old and large. It was not of paper, nor of parchment, asother books be, but was only made of delicate rinds (as it seemed to me) oftender young trees. The cover of it was of brass, well bound, all engraven withletters, or strange figures; and for my part I think they might well be Greekcharacters, or some such like ancient language. Sure I am. I could not readthem, and I know well they were not notes nor letters of the Latin nor of theGaul, for of them we understand a little.“As for that which was within it, the leaves of bark or rind, were engraven andwith admirable diligence written, with a point of iron, in fair and neat Latinletters colored. It contained thrice seven leaves, for so were they counted inthe top of the leaves, and always every seventh leaf there was painted a virginand serpent swallowing her up. In the second seventh, a cross where a serpentwas crucified; and the last seventh, there were painted deserts, orwildernesses, in the midst whereof ran many fair fountains, from whence thereissued out a number of serpents, which ran up and down here and there. Upon thefirst of the leaves, was written in great capital letters of gold, Abraham theJew, Prince, Priest, Levite, Astrologer, and Philosopher, to the Nation of theJews, by the Wrath of God dispersed among the Gauls, sendeth Health. After thisit was filled with great execrations and curses (with this word Maranatha, whichwas often repeated there) against every person that should cast his eyes uponit, if he were not Sacrificer or Scribe.“He that sold me this book knew not what it was worth nor more than I when Ibought it; I believe it had been stolen or taken from the miserable Jews, orfound in some part of the ancient place of their abode. Within the book, in thesecond leaf, he comforted his nation, counselling them to fly vices, and aboveall idolatry, attending with sweet patience the coming of the Messias, Whoshould vanquish all the kings of the earth and should reign with His people inglory eternally. Without doubt this had been some very wise and understandingman.“In the third leaf, and in all the other writings that followed, to help hiscaptive nation to pay their tributes unto the Roman emperors, and to do otherthings, which I will not speak of, he taught them in common words thetransmutation of metals; he painted the vessels by the sides, and he advertisedthem of the colors, and of all the rest, saving of the first agent, of the whichhe spake not a word, but only (as he said) in the fourth and fifth leaves entirehe painted it, and figured it with very great cunning and workmanship: foralthough it was well and intelligibly figured and painted, yet no man could everhave been able to understand it, without being well skilled in their Cabala,which goeth by tradition, and without having well studied their books.“The fourth and fifth leaves therefore, were without any writing, all full offair figures enlightened, or as it were enlightened, for the work was veryexquisite. First he painted a young man with wings at his ancles, having in hishand a Caducean rod, writhen about with two serpents, wherewith he struck upon ahelmet which covered his head. He seemed to my small judgment, to be the GodMercury of the pagans: against him there came running and flying with openwings, a great old man, who upon his head had an hour glass fastened, and in hishand a book (or sythe) like death, with the which, in terrible and furiousmanner, he would have cut off the feet of Mercury. On the other side of thefourth leaf, he painted a fair flower on the top of a very high mountain whichwas sore shaken with the North wind; it had the foot blue, the flowers white andred, the leaves shining like fine gold: and round about it the dragons andgriffons of the North made their nests and abode.“On the fifth leaf there was a fair rose tree flowered in the midst of a sweetgarden, climbing up against a hollow oak; at the foot whereof boiled a fountainof most white water, which ran headlong down into the depths, notwithstanding itfirst passed among the hands of infinite people, who digged in the earth seekingfor it; but because they were blind, none of them knew it, except here and thereone who considered the weight. On the last side of the fifth leaf there was aking with a great fauchion, who made to be killed in his presence by somesoldiers a great multitude of little infants, whose mothers wept at the feet ofthe unpitiful soldiers: the blood of which infants was afterwards by othersoldiers gathered up, and put in a great vessel, wherein the sun and the mooncame to bathe themselves.“And because that this history did represent the more part of that of theinnocents slain by Herod, and that in this book I learned the greatest part ofthe art, this was one of the causes why I placed in their church-yard theseHieroglyphic Symbols of this secret science. And thus you see that which was inthe first five leaves.“I will not represent unto you that which was written in good and intelligibleLatin in all the other written leaves, for God would punish me, because I shouldcommit a greater wickedness, than he who (as it is said) wished that all the menof the World had but one head that he might cut it off with one blow. Havingwith me therefore this fair book, I did nothing else day nor night, but studyupon it, understanding very well all the operations that it showed, but notknowing with what matter I should begin, which made me very heavy and solitary,and caused me to fetch many a sigh. My wife Perrenella, whom I loved as myself,and had lately married was much astonished at this, comforting me, and earnestlydemanding, if she could by any means deliver me from this trouble. I could notpossibly hold my tongue, but told her all, and showed this fair book, whereof atthe same instant that she saw it, she became as much enamoured as myself, takingextreme pleasure to behold the fair cover, gravings, images, and portraits,whereof notwithstanding she understood as little as I: yet it was a greatcomfort to me to talk with her, and to entertain myself, what we should do tohave the interpretation of them.”Nicholas Flammel spent many years studying the mysterious book. He even paintedthe pictures from it all over the walls of his house and made numerous copieswhich he showed to the learned men with whom he came in contact, but none couldexplain their secret significance. At last he determined to go forth in quest ofan adept, or wise man, and after many wanderings he met a physician—by nameMaster Canches—who was immediately interested in the diagrams and asked to seethe original book. They started forth together for Paris, and on the way thephysician adept explained many of the principles of the hieroglyphics toFlammel, but before they reached their journey’s end Master Canches was takenill and died. Flammel buried him at Orleans, but having meditated deeply on theinformation he had secured during their brief acquaintance, he was able, withthe assistance of his wife, to work out the formula for transmuting base metalsinto gold. He performed the experiment several times with perfect success, andbefore his death caused a number of hieroglyphic figures to be painted upon anarch of St. Innocent’s churchyard in Paris, wherein he concealed the entireformula as it had been revealed to him from the Book of Abraham the Jew."},{"pageContent":"COUNT BERNARD OF TREVISO Of all those who sought for the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher’s Stone, fewpassed through the chain of disappointments that beset Count Bernard of Treviso,who was born in Padua in 1406 and died in 1490. His search for the Philosopher’sStone and the secret of the transmutation of metals began when he was butfourteen years of age. He spent not only a lifetime but also a fortune in hisquest. Count Bernard went from one alchemist and philosopher to another, each ofwhom unfolded some pet theorem which he eagerly accepted and experimented withbut always without the desired result. His family believed him to be mad anddeclared that he was disgracing his house by his experiments, which were rapidlyreducing him to a state of penury. He traveled in many countries, hoping that indistant places he would find wise men capable of assisting him. At last as hewas approaching his seventy-sixth year, he was rewarded with success. The greatsecrets of the Elixir of Life, the Philosopher’s Stone, and the transmutation ofmetals were revealed to him. He wrote a little book describing the results ofhis labors, and while he lived only a few years to enjoy the fruitage of hisdiscovery he was thoroughly satisfied that the treasure he had found was worththe lifetime spent in search of it. An example of the industry and perseverancedisplayed by him is to be found in one of the processes which some foolishpretender coaxed him to attempt and which resulted in his spending twenty yearscalcining egg shells and nearly an equal period distilling alcohol and othersubstances. In the history of alchemical research there never was a more patientand persevering disciple of the Great Arcanum.Bernard declared the process of dissolution, accomplished not with fire but withmercury, to be the supreme secret of alchemy."},{"pageContent":"XXXV The Theory and Practice of Alchemy PART I Alchemy, the secret art of the land of Khem, is one of the two oldest sciencesknown to the world. The other is astrology. The beginnings of both extend backinto the obscurity of prehistoric times. According to the earliest recordsextant, alchemy and astrology were considered as divinely revealed to man sothat by their aid he might regain his lost estate. According to old legendspreserved by the Rabbins, the angel at the gate of Eden instructed Adam in themysteries of Qabbalah and of alchemy, promising that when the human race hadthoroughly mastered the secret wisdom concealed within these inspired arts, thecurse of the forbidden fruit would be removed and man might again enter into theGarden of the Lord. As man took upon himself “coats of skins” (physical bodies)at the time of his fall, so these sacred sciences were brought by him into thelower worlds incarnated in dense vehicles, through which their spiritualtranscendental natures could no longer manifest themselves. Therefore they wereconsidered as being dead or lost.The earthly body of alchemy is chemistry, for chemists do not realize that halfof The Book of Torah is forever concealed behind the veil of Isis (see theTarot), and that so long as they study only material elements they can at bestdiscover but half of the mystery. Astrology has crystallized into astronomy,whose votaries ridicule the dreams of ancient seers and sages, deriding theirsymbols as meaningless products of superstition. Nevertheless, theintelligentsia of the modern world can never pass behind the veil which dividesthe seen from the unseen except in the way appointed—the Mysteries.What is life? What is intelligence? What is force? These are the problems to thesolution of which the ancients consecrated their temples of learning. Who shallsay that they did not answer those questions? Who would recognize the answers ifgiven? Is it possible that under the symbols of alchemy and astrology liesconcealed a wisdom so abstruse that the mind of this race is not qualified toconceive its principles?The Chaldeans, Phœnicians, and Babylonians were familiar with the principles ofalchemy, as were many early Oriental races. It was practiced in Greece and Rome;was the master science of the Egyptians. Khem was an ancient name for the landof Egypt; and both the words alchemy and chemistry are a perpetual reminder ofthe priority of Egypt’s scientific knowledge. According to the fragmentarywritings of those early peoples, alchemy was to them no speculative art. Theyimplicitly believed in the multiplication of metals; and in the face of theirreiterations both the scholar and the materialist should be more kindly in theirconsideration of alchemical theorems. Evolutionists trace the unfoldment of thearts and sciences up through the growing intelligence of the prehistoric man,while others, of a transcendental point of view, like to consider them as beingdirect revelations from God.Many interesting solutions to the riddle of alchemy’s origin have been advanced.One is that alchemy was revealed to man by the mysterious Egyptian demigodHermes Trismegistus. This sublime figure, looking through the mists of time andbearing in his hand the immortal Emerald, is credited by the Egyptians as beingthe author of all the arts and sciences. In honor of him all scientificknowledge was gathered under the general title of The Hermetic Arts. When thebody of Hermes was interred in the Valley of Ebron (or Hebron), the divineEmerald was buried with it. Many centuries afterward the Emerald wasdiscovered—according to one version, by an Arabian initiate; according toanother, by Alexander the Great, King of Macedon. By means of the power of thisEmerald, upon which were the mysterious inscriptions of the Thrice GreatHermes—thirteen sentences in all—Alexander conquered all the then known world.Not having conquered himself, however, he ultimately failed. Regardless of hisglory and power, the prophecies of the talking trees were fulfilled, andAlexander was cut down in the midst of his triumph. (There are persistent rumorsto the effect that Alexander was an initiate of high order who failed because ofhis inability to withstand the temptations of power.)214 [images/00215.jpg] THE LEAVES OF HERMES’ SACRED TREE.In his Key to Alchemy, Samuel Norton divides into fourteen parts the processesor states through which the alchemical substances pass from the time they arefirst placed in the test tube until ready as medicines for plants, minerals, ormen:> 1.

Kenealy, quoting from the Cosmodromium of Doctor Gobelin Persona,describes the incident of Alexander and the talking trees, into the presence ofwhich the King of Macedon is said to have been brought while on his campaign inIndia: “And now Alexander marched into other quarters equally dangerous; at onetime over the tops of mountains, at another through dark valleys, in which hisarmy was attacked by serpents and wild beasts, until after three hundred days hecame into a most pleasant mountain, on whose sides hung chains or ropes of gold.This mountain had two thousand and fifty steps all of purest sapphire, by whichone could ascend to the summit, and near this Alexander encamped. And on a day,Alexander with his Twelve Princes, ascended by the aforenamed steps to the topof the Mountain, and found there a Palace marvellously beautiful, having TwelveGates, and seventy windows of the purest gold, and it was called the Palace ofthe Sun, and there was in it a Temple all of gold, before whose gates were vinetrees bearing bunches of carbuncles and pearls, and Alexander and his Princeshaving entered the Palace, found there a Man lying on a golden bedstead; he wasvery stately and beautiful in appearance, and his head and beard were white assnow. Then Alexander and his princes bent the knee to the Sage who spake thus:‘Alexander, thou shalt now see what no earthly man hath ever before seen orheard.’ To whom Alexander made answer: ‘O, Sage, most happy, how dost thou knowme?’ He replied: ‘Before the wave of the Deluge covered the face of the earth Iknew thy works.’ He added: ‘Wouldst thou behold the most hallowed Trees of theSun and Moon, which announce all future things?’ Alexander made answer: ‘It iswell, my lord; greatly do we long to see them.’***“Then the Sage said: ‘Put away your rings and ornaments, and take off yourshoes, and follow me.’ And Alexander did so, and choosing out three from thePrinces, and leaving the rest to await his return, he followed the Sage, andcame to the Trees of the Sun and Moon. The Tree of the Sun has leaves of redgold, the Tree of the Moon has leaves of silver, and they are very great, andAlexander, at the suggestion of the Sage questioned the Trees, asking if heshould return in triumph to Macedon? to which the Trees gave answer, No, butthat he should live yet another year and eight months, after which he should dieby a poisoned cup. And when he inquired, Who was he who should give him thatpoison? he received no reply, and the Tree of the Moon said to him, that hisMother, after a most shameful and unhappy death, should lie long unburied, butthat happiness was in store for his sisters.” (See The Book of Enoch, The SecondMessenger of God.)In all probability, the so-called talking trees were merely strips of wood withtables of letters upon them, by means of which oracles were evoked. At one timebooks written upon wood were called “talking trees.” The difficulty in decidingthe origin of alchemy is directly due to ignoring the lost continent ofAtlantis. The Great Arcanum was the most prized of the secrets of the Atlanteanpriestcraft. When the land of Atlas sank, hierophants of the Fire Mysterybrought the formula to Egypt, where it remained for centuries in the possessionof the sages and philosophers. It gradually moved into Europe, where its secretsare still preserved intact. Those disagreeing with the legend of Hermes and hisEmerald Tablet see in the two hundred angels who descended upon the mountains,as described by the Prophet Enoch, the first instructors in the alchemical art.Regardless of its originator, it was left to the Egyptian priests to preservealchemy for the modern world. Egypt, because of the color of its earth, wascalled “the black empire” and is referred to in the Old Testament as “the landof darkness.” By reason of its possible origin there, alchemy has long beenknown as “the black art,” not in the sense of evil but in the sense of thatdarkness which has always enshrouded its secret processes.During the Middle Ages, alchemy was not only a philosophy and a science but alsoa religion. Those who rebelled against the religious limitations of their dayconcealed their philosophic teachings under the allegory of gold-making. In thisway they preserved their personal liberty and were ridiculed rather thanpersecuted. Alchemy is a threefold art, its mystery well symbolized by atriangle. Its symbol is 3 times 3—three elements or processes in three worlds orspheres. The 3 times 3 is part of the mystery of the 33rd degree of Freemasonry,for 33 is 3 times 3, which is 9, the number of esoteric man and the number ofemanations from the root of the Divine Tree. It is the number of worldsnourished by the four rivers that pour out of the Divine Mouth as the verbumfiat. Beneath the so-called symbolism of alchemy is concealed a magnificentconcept, for this ridiculed and despised craft still preserves intact the triplekey to the gates of eternal life. Realizing, therefore, that alchemy is amystery in three worlds—the divine, the human, and the elemental—It can easilybe appreciated why the sages and philosophers created and evolved an intricateallegory to conceal their wisdom.Alchemy is the science of multiplication and is based upon the naturalphenomenon of growth. “Nothing from nothing comes,” is an extremely ancientadage. Alchemy is not the process of making something from nothing; it is theprocess of increasing and improving that which already exists. If a philosopherwere to state that a living man could be made from a stone, the unenlightenedwould probably exclaim, “Impossible!” Thus would they reveal their ignorance,for to the wise it is known that in every stone is the seed of man. Aphilosopher might declare that a universe could be made out of a man, but thefoolish would regard this as an impossibility, not realizing that a man is aseed from which a universe may be brought forth.God is the “within” and the “without” of all things. The Supreme One manifestsHimself through growth, which is an urge from within outward, a struggle forexpression and manifestation. There is no greater miracle in the growing andmultiplication of gold by the alchemist than in a tiny mustard seed producing abush many thousands of times the size of the seed. If a mustard seed produces ahundred thousand times its own size and weight when planted in an entirelydifferent substance (the earth), why should not the seed of gold be multiplied ahundred thousand times by art when that seed is planted in its earth (the basemetals) and nourished artificially by the secret process of alchemy?Alchemy teaches that God is in everything; that He is One Universal Spirit,manifesting through an infinity of forms. God, therefore, is the spiritual seedplanted in the dark earth (the material universe). By art it is possible so togrow and expand this seed that the entire universe of substance is tincturedthereby and becomes like unto the seed—pure gold. In the spiritual nature of manthis is termed regeneration; in the material body of the elements it is calledtransmuta-tion. As it is in the spiritual and material universes, so it is inthe intellectual world. Wisdom cannot be imparted to an idiot because the seedof wisdom is not within him, but wisdom may be imparted to an ignorant person,however ignorant he may be, because the seed of wisdom exists in him and can bedeveloped by art and culture. Hence a philosopher is only an ignorant man withinwhose nature a projection has taken place.Through art (the process of learning) the whole mass of base metals (the mentalbody of ignorance) was transmuted into pure gold (wisdom), for it was tincturedwith understanding. If, then, through faith and proximity to God theconsciousness of man may be transmuted from base animal desires (represented bythe masses of the planetary metals) into a pure, golden, and godlyconsciousness, illumined and redeemed, and the manifesting God within that oneincreased from a tiny spark to a great and glorious Being; if also the basemetals of mental ignorance can, through proper endeavor and training, betransmuted into transcendent genius and wisdom, why is the process in two worldsor spheres of application not equally true in the third? If both the spiritualand mental elements of the universe can be multiplied in their expression, thenby the law of analogy the material elements of the universe can also bemultiplied, if the necessary process can be ascertained.That which is true in the superior is true in the inferior. If alchemy be agreat spiritual fact, then it is also a great material fact. If it can takeplace in the universe, it can take place in man; if it can take place in man, itcan take place in the plants and minerals. If one thing in the universe grows,than everything in the universe grows. If one thing can be multiplied, then allthings can be multiplied, “for the superior agrees with the inferior and theinferior agrees with the superior.” But as the way for the redemption of thesoul is concealed by the Mysteries, so the secrets for the redemption of themetals are also concealed, that they may not fall into the hands of the profaneand thereby become perverted.If any would grow metals, he must first learn the secrets of the metals: he mustrealize that all metals—like all stones, plants, animals, and universes—growfrom seeds, and that these seeds are already in the body of Substance (the wombof the World Virgin); for the seed of man is in the universe before he is born(or grows), and as the seed of the plant exists for all time though the plantlive but a part of that time, so the seeds of spiritual gold and material goldare ever present in all things. The metals grow throughout the ages, becauselife is imparted to them from the sun. They grow imperceptibly, in form liketiny shrubs, for everything grows in some way. Only the methods of growthdiffer, according to kind and magnitude.One of the great axioms is, “Within everything is the seed of everything,”although by the simple processes of Nature it may remain latent for manycenturies, or its growth may be exceedingly slow. Therefore, every grain of sandcontains not only the seed of the precious metals as well as the seed of theprice- less gems, but also the seeds of sun, moon, and stars. As within thenature of man is reflected the entire universe in miniature, so in each grain ofsand, each drop of water, each tiny particle of cosmic dust, are concealed allthe parts and elements of cosmos in the form of tiny seed germs so minute thateven the most powerful microscope cannot detect them. Trillions of times smallerthan the ion or electron, these seeds—unrecognizable and incomprehensible—awaitthe time assigned them for growth and expression. (Consider the monads ofLeibnitz.)215 [images/00216.jpg] A TABLE OF MEDIÆVAL ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS.Hermetists used the curious symbols shown in this rare table to representvarious chemical elements and alchemical processes. The full meaning of thesestrange characters has never been revealed, the characters concealingeffectually within their own forms the occult secrets regarding the spiritualnature of the metals and elements which they represent.In their allegories the alchemists also used human, animal, and plant emblems;sometimes weird composite figures, such as the dragon, the winged serpent, theunicorn, and the phœnix. In almost every case they symbolized gold as a kingwith a crown on his head and often with a scepter in his hand. Sometimes theydepicted him with the face of the solar disc surrounded by rays. Silver waspersonified as a woman, whom they called the queen. She wore no crown but oftenstood upon a lunar crescent, much after the fashion of the Madonna. Mercury wastypified as a youth with wings, often with two heads, carrying serpents orsometimes the caduceus. Lead they symbolized by an old man with a scythe in hishand; iron by a soldier dressed in armor. To aqua fortis was given the curiousname “the ostrich’s stomach,” and to the attainment of the “Great Work” theyassigned the symbol of the phœnix sitting upon a nest of fire. The union ofelements they symbolized by a marriage, the process of putrefaction by a skull,antimony by a dragon. There are two methods whereby growth may be accomplished. The first is byNature, for Nature is an alchemist forever achieving the apparently impossible.The second is by art, and through art is produced in a comparatively short timethat which requires Nature almost endless periods to duplicate. The truephilosopher, desiring to accomplish the Magnum Opus, patterns his conductaccording to the laws of Nature, recognizing that the art of alchemy is merely amethod copied from Nature but with the aid of certain secret formulae greatlyshortened by being correspondingly intensified. Nature, in order to achieve hermiracles, must work through either extensiveness or intensiveness. The extensiveprocesses of Nature are such as are used in the transmutation of the pitch ofblack carbon into diamonds, requiring millions of years of natural hardening.The intensive process is art, which is ever the faithful servant of Nature (asDr. A. Dee says), supplementing her every step and cooperating with her in allher ways. “So, in this philosophical work, Nature and Art ought so lovingly toembrace each other, as that Art may not require what Nature denies, nor Naturedeny what may be perfected by Art. For Nature assenting, she demeans herselfobediently to every artist, whilst by their industry she is helped, nothindered.” (Dr. A. Dee in his Chemical Collections.)By means of this art the seed which is within the soul of a stone may be made togerminate so intensively that in a few moments a diamond is grown from the seedof itself. If the seed of the diamond were not in the marble, granite, and sand,a diamond could not be grown therefrom. But as the seed is within all thesethings, a diamond may be grown out of any other substance in the universe. Insome substances, however, it is easier to perform this miracle because in themthese germs have already been long fertilized and are thus more nearly preparedfor the vivifying process of the art. Likewise, to teach some men wisdom iseasier than to teach others, for some already have a foundation upon which towork, while in others the thinking faculties are entirely dormant. Alchemy,therefore, should be regarded as the art of increasing and bringing into perfectflower with the greatest possible expedition. Nature may accomplish her desiredend or, because of the destructiveness exercised by one element over another,she may not; but with the aid of the true art, Nature always accomplishes herend, for this art is not subject either to the wastings of time or to thevandalism of elemental reactions.In his History of Chemistry, James Campbell Brown, late professor of chemistryin the University of Liverpool, sums up the ends which alchemists sought toachieve, in the following paragraphs:“This, therefore, was the general aim of the alchemists—to carry out in thelaboratory, as far as possible, the process which Nature carried out in theinterior of the earth. Seven leading problems occupied their attention:—> “1. The preparation of a compound named elixir, magisterium medicine, or> philosopher’s stone, which possessed the property of transmuting the baser> metals into gold and silver, and of performing many other marvelous> operations. * * *> “2. The creation of homunculi, or living beings, of which many wonderful but> incredible tales are told.> “3. The preparation of the alcahest or universal solvent, which dissolved> every substance which was immersed in it. * * *> “4. Palingenesis, or the restoration of a plant from its ashes. Had they> succeeded in this, they would have hoped to be able to raise the dead.> [Professor Brown takes a great deal for granted.]> “5. The preparation of spiritus mundi, a mystic substance possessing many> powers, the principal of which was its capacity of dissolving gold.> “6. The extraction of the quintessence or active principle of all substances.> “7. The preparation of aurum potabile, liquid gold, a sovereign remedy,> because gold being itself perfect could produce perfection in the human> frame.” "},{"pageContent":"ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLISM In alchemy there are three symbolic substances: mercury, sulphur, and salt. Tothese was added a fourth mysterious life principle called Azoth. Concerning thefirst three, Herr von Welling has written: “There are three basic chemicalsubstances which are called by the philosophers salt, sulphur, and mercury, butwhich are not to be confounded in any way with the crude salt, sulphur, andmercury taken from the earth or secured from the apothecary. Salt, sulphur, andmercury each has a triune nature, for each of these substances contains, inreality, also the other two substances, according to the secret arcanum of thewise. The body of salt is, therefore, threefold, namely salt, sulphur, andmercury; but in the body of salt one of the three (salt) predominates. Mercuryis likewise composed of salt, sulphur, and mercury with the latter elementpredominating. Sulphur, similarly, is actually salt, sulphur, and mercury, withsulphur predominating. These nine divisions—3 times 3, plus Azoth (themysterious universal life force), equals 10, the sacred decad of Pythagoras.Concerning the nature of Azoth there is much controversy. Some view it as theinvisible, eternal fire; others as electricity; still others as magnetism.Transcendentalists refer to it as the astral light.“The universe is surrounded by the sphere of the stars. Beyond that sphere isthe sphere of Schamayim, which is the Divine fiery water, the first outflow ofthe Word of God, the flaming river pouring from the presence of the Eternal.Schamayim, the fiery androgynous water, divides. The fire becomes the solar fireand the water becomes the lunar water. Schamayim is the universalmercury—sometimes called Azoth—the measureless spirit of life. The spiritualfiery original water—Schamayim—comes through Eden (in Hebrew, vapor) and poursitself into four main rivers [the elements]. This is the river of livingwater—Azoth [the fiery mercurial essence] that flows out from the throne of Godand the Lamb. In this Eden [vaporous essence or mist] is the spiritual earth[incomprehensible and intangible], or the dust Aphar, out of which God formedAdam min Haadamah, the spiritual body of man, which body must sometime becomerevealed.”In another part of his writings von Welling also says that there was no materialuniverse until Lucifer, attempting to perform the cosmic alchemy, misused theSchamayim, or the Divine Fire. In order to reestablish the Schamayim whichLucifer had perverted, this universe was formed as a means of liberating it fromthe dark cloud within which it was locked by the failure of Lucifer’s attempt tocontrol it. These statements clearly emphasize the fact that the earlyphilosophers recognized in the Bible a book of chemical and alchemical formulae.It is essential that this point be kept in mind at all times. Woe to that seekerwho accepts as literal the rambling allegories of the alchemists. Such a one cannever enter the inner sanctuary of truth. Elias Ashmole in his Theatrum ChemicumBritannicum thus describes the methods employed by the alchemists to concealtheir true doctrines: “Their chiefest study was to wrap up their Secrets inFables, and spin out their Fancies in Vailes and shadows, whose Radii seems toextend every way, yet so, that they meet in a Common Center, and point onely atOne thing.”The fact that the Scriptures reveal a hidden knowledge, if consideredallegorically, is clearly demonstrated by a parable describing King Solomon, hiswives, concubines, and virgins, which parable occurs in Geheime Figuren derRosenkreuzer, published in Ultona in 1785. Dr. Hartmann, who translated part ofthis work into English, declared that the wives of Solomon represented the arts,the concubines the sciences, and the virgins the still unrevealed secrets ofNature. By order of the King the virgins were forced to remove their veils, thussignifying that by means of wisdom (Solomon) the mystic arts were forced todisclose their hidden parts to the philosopher, while to the uninitiated worldonly the outside garments were visible. (Such is the mystery of the veil ofIsis.)As the alchemist must do his work in four worlds simultaneously if he wouldachieve the Magnum Opus, a table showing the analogies of the three principlesin the four worlds may clarify the relationship which the various parts bear toeach other. The early masters of the art of alchemical symbolism did notstandardize either their symbols or their terms. Thus it required greatfamiliarity with the subject combined with considerable intuitive power tounravel some of their enigmatical statements. The third and fourth divisions ofthe following table are given alternative renderings, owing to the fact thatsome authors did not draw a clear line between spirit and soul. According to theScriptures, spirit is indestructible, but soul is destructible. Obviously, then,they are not synonymous. It is clearly stated that “the soul that sinneth, itshall die,” but “the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” The table ofanalogies, as nearly as they can be established, is as follows:THE TRIUNE POWER IN FOUR WORLDS216 [images/00217.jpg] The alternative renderings of 3 and 4 are:217 [images/00218.jpg] Paracelsus made a different arrangement, somewhat Aristotelian, in which thethree phases of the Triune God are omitted, combining only the elements of thesecond, third, and fourth worlds:218 [images/00219.jpg] The main point, however, is proved: the alchemical philosophers used the symbolsof salt, sulphur, and mercury to represent not only chemicals but the spiritualand invisible principles of God, man, and the universe. The three substances(salt, sulphur, and mercury) existing in four worlds, as shown in the table, sumup to the sacred number 12. As these 12 are the foundations of the Great Work,they are called in Revelation the twelve foundation stones of the sacred city.In line with the same idea Pythagoras asserted that the dodecahedron, ortwelve-faced symmetrical geometric solid, was the foundation of the universe.May there not be a relation also between this mysterious 3 times 4 and the fourparties of three which in the legend of the third degree of Freemasonry go forthto the four angles of the cherubim, the composite creature of four parts?The following table shows the angles to which the parties of three (salt,sulphur, and mercury) go in search of CHiram:219 [images/00220.jpg] One more table should prove of interest to Masonic scholars: one showing therelationship existing between the three substances, salt, sulphur, and mercury,and certain symbols with which Masons are familiar. This table also has analternative rendering, based on the interblending of philosophic principles,which are difficult—if not impossible—to separate into chronological order.220 [images/00221.jpg] The alternative rendering of No. 2 is:221 [images/00222.jpg] In alchemy is found again the perpetuation of the Universal Mystery; for assurely as Jesus died upon the cross, Hiram (CHiram) at the west gate of theTemple, Orpheus on the banks of the river Hebros, Christna on the banks of theGanges, and Osiris in the coffin prepared by Typhon, so in alchemy, unless theelements first die, the Great Work cannot be achieved. The stages of thealchemical processes can be traced in the lives and activities of nearly all theworld Saviors and teachers, and also among the mythologies of several nations.It is said in the Bible that “except a man be born again, he cannot see thekingdom of God.” In alchemy it is declared that without putrefaction the GreatWork cannot be accomplished. What is it that dies on the cross, is buried in thetomb of the Mysteries, and that dies also in the retort and becomes black withputrefaction? Also, what is it that does this same thing in the nature of man,that he may rise again, phœnix-like, from his own ashes (caput mortuum)?The solution in the alchemical retort, if digested a certain length of time,will turn into a red elixir, which is called the universal medicine. Itresembles a fiery water and is luminous in the dark. During the process ofdigestion it passes through many colors which has given rise to its being calledthe peacock because of its iridescence during one of the periods of itsdigestion. If the augmentations of its power be carried too far, the test tubecontaining the substance will explode and vanish as dust. This commonly occursand is the greatest danger involved in the preparation of the medicine for menand metals. If developed too far, it will also seep through the glass, for thereis no physical container sufficiently strong to hold it. The reason for this isthat it is no longer a substance but a divine essence partaking of theinterpenetrative power of Divinity. When it is properly developed, thisuniversal solvent in liquid form will dissolve into itself all other metals. Inthis high state the universal salt is a liquid fire. This salt dissolved withthe proper amount of any metal and run through the different stages of digestionand rotations of augmentations will eventually become a medicine for thetransmuting of inferior metals.The True Way of Nature by Hermes Trismegistus, given out by a genuine Freemason,I.C.H., describes the danger of over-augmenting the universal salt: “But thismultiplication cannot be carried on ad infinitum but it attains completeness inthe ninth rotation. For when this tincture has been rotated nine times it cannotbe exalted any further because it will not permit any further separation. For assoon as it perceives only the smallest degree of material fire it goes instantlyinto a flux and passes through the glass like hot oil through paper.”In classifying the processes through which the chemical elements must passbefore the Hermetic medicine is produced, lack of uniformity in terminology isevidenced, for in The True Way of Nature seven stages are given, while in theDictionnaire Mytho-Hermétique twelve are noted. These twelve are linked with thesigns of the zodiac in a manner worthy of consideration.> 1. Aries, Calcination> 2. Taurus, Congelation> 3. Gemini, Fixation> 4. Cancer, Dissolution> 5. Leo, Digestion> 6. Virgo, Distillation> 7. Libra, Sublimation> 8. Scorpio, Separation> 9. Sagittarius, Incineration> 10. Capricorn, Fermentation> 11. Aquarius, Multiplication> 12. Pisces, ProjectionThis arrangement opens an interesting field of speculation which may be of greatservice if intelligently carried out. These twelve “steps” leading up to theaccomplishment of the Magnum Opus are a reminder of the twelve degrees of theancient Rosicrucian Mysteries. To a certain degree, Rosicrucianism was chemistrytheologized and alchemy philosophized. According to the Mysteries, man wasredeemed as the result of his passage in rotation through the twelve mansions ofthe heavens. The twelve processes by means of which the “secret essence” may bediscovered remind the student forcibly of the twelve Fellow Craftsmen who aresent forth in search of the murdered Builder of the Universe, the UniversalMercury.According to Solomon Trismosin, the stages through which matter passes in itsjourney towards perfection are divided into twenty-two parts, each of which isrepresented by an appropriate drawing. There is an important connection betweenthe twenty-two emblems of Trismosin, the twenty-two major cards of the Tarot,and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. These mysterious Tarot cardsare themselves an alchemical formula, if properly interpreted. As if tosubstantiate the claims of mediaeval philosophers that King Solomon was a masterof alchemy, Dr. Franz Hartmann has noted that the much-abused and misunderstoodSong of Solomon is in reality an alchemical formula. The student of naturalphilosophy will immediately recognize the “dark maid of Jerusalem,” not as aperson but as a material sacred to the sages. Dr. Hartmann writes: “The ‘Song ofSolomon,’ in the Old Testament, is a description of the processes of Alchemy. Inthis Song the Subjectum is described in Cant. i., 5; the Lilium artis in C. ii.,1; the Preparation and Purification in C. ii., 4; the Fire in C. ii., 7, and C.iv., 16; the Putrefaction in C. iii., 1; Sublimation and Distillation in C.iii., 6; Coagulation and Change of Colors, C. v., 9 to 14; Fixation, C. ii., 12,and C. viii., 4; Multiplication, C. vi., 7; Augmentation and Projection, C.viii., 8, etc., etc.”A tiny particle of the Philosopher’s Stone, if cast upon the surface of water,will, according to an appendix to the work on the universal salt by Herr vonWelling, immediately begin a process of recapitulating in miniature the historyof the universe, for instantly the tincture—like the Spirits of Elohim—movesupon the face of the waters. A miniature universe is formed which thephilosophers have affirmed actually rises out of the water and floats in theair, where it passes through all the stages of cosmic unfoldment and finallydisintegrates into dust again. Not only is it possible to prepare a medicine formetals; it is also possible to prepare a tincture for minerals by means of whichpieces of granite and marble can be turned into precious stones; also stones ofinferior quality may be improved.As one of the great alchemists fittingly observed, man’s quest for gold is oftenhis undoing, for he mistakes the alchemical processes, believing them to bepurely material. He does not realize that the Philosopher’s Gold, thePhilosopher’s Stone, and the Philosopher’s Medicine exist in each of the fourworlds and that the consummation of the experiment cannot be realized until itis successfully carried on in four worlds simultaneously according to oneformula. Furthermore, one of the constituents of the alchemical formula existsonly within the nature of man himself, without which his chemicals will notcombine, and though he spend his life and fortune in chemical experimentation,he will not produce the desired end. The paramount reason why the materialscientist is incapable of duplicating the achievements of the mediaevalalchemists—although he follow every step carefully and accurately—is that thesubtle element which comes out of the nature of the illuminated and regeneratedalchemical philosopher is missing in his experimentation.On this subject Dr. Franz Hartmann in a footnote to his translation of extractsfrom Paracelsus clearly expresses the conclusions of a modern investigator ofalchemical lore: “I wish to warn the reader, who might be inclined to try any ofthe alchemical prescriptions * * *, not to do so unless he is an alchemist,because, although I know from personal experience that these prescriptions arenot only allegorically but literally true, and will prove successful in thehands of an alchemist, they would only cause a waste of time and money in thehands of one who has not the necessary qualifications. A person who wants to bean alchemist must have in himself the ‘magnesia’, which means, the magneticpower to attract and ‘coagulate’ invisible astral elements.”In considering the formulae on the following pages, it must be recognized thatthe experiments cannot be successfully conducted unless the one who performsthem be himself a Magus. If two persons, one an initiate and the otherunilluminated in the supreme art, were to set to work, side by side, using thesame vessels, the same substances, and exactly the same modus operandi, theinitiate would produce his “gold” and the uninitiated would not. Unless thegreater alchemy has first taken place within the soul of man, he cannot performthe lesser alchemy in the retort. This is an invariable rule, although it iscunningly hidden in the allegories and emblems of Hermetic philosophy. Unless aman be “born again” he cannot accomplish the Great Work, and if the student ofalchemical formulae will remember this, it will save him much sorrow anddisappointment. To speak of that part of the mystery which is concerned with thesecret life principle within the actual nature of man, is forbidden, for it isdecreed by the Masters of the art that each shall discover that for himself onthis subject it is unlawful to speak at greater length."},{"pageContent":"XXXVI The Theory and Practice of Alchemy PART II All true philosophers of the natural or Hermetic sciences begin their laborswith a prayer to the Supreme Alchemist of the Universe, beseeching Hisassistance in the consummation of the Magnum Opus. The prayer that follows,written in a provincial German centuries ago by an adept now unknown, isrepresentative:“O holy and hallowed Trinity, Thou undivided and triple Unity! Cause me to sinkinto the abyss of Thy limitless eternal Fire, for only in that Fire can themortal nature of man be changed into humble dust, while the new body of the saltunion lies in the light. Oh, melt me and transmute me in this Thy holy Fire, sothat on the day at Thy command the fiery waters of the Holy Spirit draw me outfrom the dark dust, giving me new birth and making me alive with His breath. MayI also be exalted through the humble humility of Thy Son, rising through Hisassistance out of the dust and ashes and changing into a pure spiritual body ofrainbow colors like unto the transparent, crystal-like, paradisiacal gold, thatmy own nature may be redeemed and purified like the elements before me in theseglasses and bottles. Diffuse me in the waters of life as though I were in thewine cellar of the eternal Solomon. Here the fire of Thy love will receive newfuel and will blaze forth so that no streams can extinguish it. Through the aidof this divine fire, may I in the end be found worthy to be called into theillumination of the righteous. May I then be sealed up with the light of the newworld that I may also attain unto the immortality and glory where there shall beno more alternation of light and darkness. Amen.”222 [images/00223.jpg] THE KEY TO ALCHEMY ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIANS.The priests of Egypt not only used the scarab as a symbol of regeneration butalso discovered in its habits many analogies to the secret processes wherebybase metals could be transmuted into gold. They saw in the egg of the scarab theseed of the metals, and the above figure shows the path of this seed through thevarious planetary bodies until, finally reaching the center, it is perfected andthen returns again to its source. The words in the small spiral at the top read:“The spiral progress of the mundane spirit.” After the scarab has wound its wayaround the spiral to the center of the lower part of the figure, it returns tothe upper world along the path bearing the words: “Return of the spirit to thecenter of unity.”"},{"pageContent":"THE ORIGIN OF ALCHEMICAL FORMULÆ Apparently but few of the mediaeval alchemists discovered the Great Arcanumwithout aid, some authors declaring that none of them attained the desired endwithout the assistance of a Master or Teacher. In every instance the identity ofthese Masters has been carefully concealed, and even during the Middle Agesspeculation ran rife concerning them. It was customary to call such illuminatedsages adepts, a title which indicated that they possessed the true secrets oftransmutation and multiplication. These adepts were polyonymous individuals whounexpectedly appeared and disappeared again, leaving no trace of theirwhereabouts. There are indications that a certain degree of organization existedamong them. The most powerful of the alchemical organizations were theRosicrucians, the Illuminati, and certain Arabian and Syrian sects.In the documents which follow, references are made to the “Brethren” or“Brothers.” These are to signify that those who had actually accomplished theMagnum Opus were banded together and known to each other by cipher codes andsecret signs or symbols. Apparently a number of these illuminated adepts dweltin Arabia, for several of the great European alchemists were initiated in AsiaMinor. When a disciple of the alchemical arts had learned the supreme secret, heguarded it jealously, revealing to no man his priceless treasure. He was notpermitted to disclose it even to the members of his immediate family.As the years passed, one who had discovered the secret—or, more properly, one towhom it had been revealed—sought for some younger man worthy to be entrustedwith the formulae. To this one, and to this one only, as a rule, the philosopherwas permitted to disclose the arcanum. The younger man then became the“philosophical son” of the old sage, and to him the latter bequeathed hissecrets. Occasionally, however, an adept, on finding a sincere and earnestseeker, would instruct him in the fundamental principles of the art, and if thedisciple persisted, he was quietly initiated into the august fraternity of theBrethren. In such manner the alchemical processes were preserved, but the numberof those who knew them did not increase rapidly.During the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries a considerablenumber of alchemical adepts made their way from place to place throughoutEurope, appearing and disappearing apparently at will. According to populartradition, these adepts were immortal, and kept themselves alive by means of themysterious medicine that was one of the goals of alchemical aspiration. It isasserted that some lived hundreds of years, taking no food except this elixir, afew drops of which would preserve their youth for a long period of time. Thatsuch mysterious men did exist there can be little doubt, as their presence isattested by scores of reliable witnesses.It is further asserted that they are still to be found by those who havequalified themselves to contact them. The philosophers taught that like attractslike, and that when the disciple has developed a virtue and integrity acceptableto the adepts they will appear to him and reveal those parts of the secretprocesses which cannot be discovered without such help. “Wisdom is as a flowerfrom which the bee its honey makes and the spider poison, each according to itsown nature.” (By an unknown adept.)The reader must bear in mind at all times that the formulae and emblems ofalchemy are to be taken primarily as allegorical symbols; for until theiresoteric significance has been comprehended, their literal interpretation isvalueless. Nearly every alchemical formula has one element purposely omitted, itbeing decided by the mediaeval philosophers that those who could not with theirown intelligence discover that missing substance or process were not qualifiedto be entrusted with secrets which could give them control over great masses ofhumanity and likewise subject to their will the elemental forces of Nature."},{"pageContent":"THE EMERALD TABLET OF HERMES The oldest and most revered of all the alchemical formulae is the sacred EmeraldTablet of Hermes. Authorities do not agree as to the genuineness of this Table,some declaring it to be a post-Christian fraud, but there is much evidence that,regardless of its author, the Table is of great antiquity. While the symbol ofthe Emerald Table is of special Masonic import—relating as it does to thepersonality of CHiram (Hiram)—it is first and fundamentally an alchemicalformula, relating both to the alchemy of the base metals and the divine alchemyof human regeneration.In Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom’s collection of alchemical manuscripts is a sectiondevoted to the translations and interpretations of this remarkable Tablet, whichwas known to the ancients as the Tabula Smaragdina. Dr. Bacstrom was initiatedinto the Brotherhood of the Rose Cross on the island of Mauritius by one ofthose unknown adepts who at that time called himself Comte de Chazal. Dr.Bacstrom’s translations and notes on the Emerald Tablet are, in part, asfollows, the actual text being reproduced in capital letters:“The Emerald Table, the Most Ancient Monument of the Chaldeans concerning theLapis Philosophorum (the stone of the philosophers).“The Emerald Table furnishes the origin of the allegorical history of King Hiram(rather Chiram). The Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Hebrews in what concerns Chiramhave taken their knowledge from one and the same fountain; Homerus, who relatesthis history in a different manner, followed that original, and Virgil followedHomerus, as Hesiodus took the subject for his Theogony likewise from thence,which Ovidius took afterwards for a pattern for his Metamorphosis. The knowledgeof Nature’s secret operations constitutes the principal sense of all theseancient writings, but ignorance framed out of it that external or veiledmythology and the lower class of people turned it into idolatry.“The Genuine Translation from the Original Very Ancient Chaldee is as Follows:“THE SECRET WORKS OF CHIRAM ONE IN ESSENCE, BUT THREE IN ASPECT.“(The two first large words mean the Secret Work.)“(The second line in large letters, reads: Chiram Telat Machasot, i.e. Chiramthe Universal Agent, One in Essence but three in aspect. )“IT IS TRUE, NO LIE, CERTAIN, AND TO BE DEPENDED UPON, THE SUPERIOR AGREES WITHTHE INFERIOR, AND THE INFERIOR WITH THE SUPERIOR, TO EFFECT THAT ONE TRULYWONDERFUL WORK. AS ALL THINGS OWE THEIR EXISTENCE TO THE WILL OF THE ONLY ONE,SO ALL THINGS OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO THE ONE ONLY THING, THE MOST HIDDEN, BY THEARRANGEMENT OF THE ONLY GOD. THE FATHER OF THAT ONE ONLY THING IS THE SUN, ITSMOTHER IS THE MOON, THE WIND CARRIES IT IN ITS BELLY; BUT ITS NOURSE IS ASPIRITUOUS EARTH. THAT ONE ONLY THING (after God) IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS INTHE UNIVERSE. ITS POWER IS PERFECT, AFTER IT HAS BEEN UNITED TO A SPIRITUOUSEARTH.“(Process-First Distillation.) SEPARATE THAT SPIRITUOUS EARTH FROM THE DENSE ORCRUDE BY MEANS OF A GENTLE HEAT, WITH MUCH ATTENTION.“(Last Digestion.) IN GREAT MEASURE IT ASCENDS FROM THE EARTH UP TO HEAVEN, ANDDESCENDS AGAIN, NEWBORN, ON THE EARTH, AND THE SUPERIOR AND THE INFERIOR AREINCREASED IN POWER. The Azoth ascends from the Earth, from the bottom of theGlass, and redescends in Veins and drops into the Earth and by this continualcirculation the Azoth is more and more subtilized, Volatilizes Sol and carriesthe volatilized Solar atoms along with it and thereby becomes a Solar Azoth,i.e. our third, and genuine Sophic Mercury, and this circulation of the SolarAzoth must continue until it ceases of itself, and the Earth has sucked it allin, when it must become the black pitchy matter, the Toad [the substances in thealchemical retort and also the lower elements in the body of man], which denotescomplete putrefaction or Death of the Compound.“BY THIS THOU WILT PARTAKE OF THE HONOURS OF THE WHOLE WORLD. Without doubt asthe black, pitchy matter will and must of necessity become White and Red, andthe Red having been carried to perfection, medicinally and for Metals, is thenfully capable to preserve mentem sanam in carpore sano until the natural periodof Life and promise us ample means, in infinitum multipliable, to be benevolentand charitable without any diminution of our inexhaustible resources, thereforewell may it be called the Glory [Honours] of the Whole World, as truly the studyand contemplation of the L. P. [Lapis Philosophorum], harmonising with DivineTruths, elevates the mind to God our Creator and merciful Father, and if Heshould permit us to possess it practically must eradicate the very principle ofAvarice, Envy, and Evil Inclinations, and cause our hearts to melt in gratitudetoward Him that has been so kind to us! Therefore the Philosophers say withgreat Truth, that the L. P. either finds a good man or makes one.“AND DARKNESS WILL FLY FROM THEE. By invigorating the Organs the Soul makes useof for communicating with exterior objects, the Soul must acquire greater powersnot only for conception but also for retention, and therefore if we wish toobtain still more knowledge, the organs and secret springs of physical lifebeing wonderfully strengthened and invigorated, the Soul must acquire new powersfor conceiving and retaining, especially if we pray to God for knowledge, andconfirm our prayers by faith, all Obscurity must vanish of course. That this hasnot been the case with all possessors, was their own fault, as they contentedthemselves merely with the Transmutation of Metals.“(Use.) THIS IS THE STRENGTH OF ALL POWERS. This is a very strong figure, toindicate that the L. P. positively does possess all the Powers concealed inNature, not for destruction but for exaltation and regeneration of matter, inthe three Departments of Nature.“WITH ALL THIS THOU WILT BE ABLE TO OVERCOME ALL THINGS, AND TO TRANSMUTE ALLWHAT IS FINE ([ART]) AND WHAT IS COARSE ([ART]). It will conquer every subtilThing, of course, as it refixes the most subtil Oxygen into its own fiery Natureand that with more power, penetration and virtue, in a tenfold ratio, at everymultiplication, and each time in a much shorter period, until its power becomesincalculable, which multiplied power also penetrates [overcomes] every SolidThing, such as unconquerable Gold and Silver, the otherwise unalterable Mercury,Crystals and Glass Fluxes, to which it is able to give natural hardness andfixity, as Philaletha does attest, and is proved by an artificial Diamond, in myfather’s time, in possession of Prince Lichtenstein in Vienna, valued at FiveHundred Thousand Ducats, fixed by the Lapis [Philosopher’s Stone].“IN THIS MANNER THE WORLD WAS CREATED; THE ARRANGEMENTS TO FOLLOW THIS ROAD AREHIDDEN. FOR THIS REASON I AM CALLED CHIRAM TELAT MECHASOT, ONE IN ESSENCE, BUTTHREE IN ASPECT. IN THIS TRINITY IS HIDDEN THE WISDOM OF THE WHOLE WORLD (i.e.,in Chiram and its Use). It is thought that Hermes was Moses or Zoroaster,otherwise Hermes signifies a Serpent, and the Serpent used to be an Emblem ofKnowledge or Wisdom. The Serpent is met with everywhere amongst theHieroglyphics of the ancient Egyptians, so is the Globe with Wings, the Sun andMoon, Dragons and Griffins, whereby the Egyptians denoted their sublimeknowledge of the Lapis Philosophorum, according to Suidas, the hints in theScriptures, and even De Non where he speaks of the sanctuaries of the ancientEgyptian Temples.“IT IS ENDED NOW, WHAT I HAVE SAID CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF THE SUN. FINISH OFTHE TABULA SMARAGDINA. What I have said or taught of the Solar Work, is nowfinished. The perfect Seed, fit for multiplication.“This I know is acknowledged to be the genuine Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis.”"},{"pageContent":"A LETTER FROM THE BROTHERS OF R. C. (ROSE CROSS) Although Eugenius Philalethes disclaimed membership in the RosicrucianFraternity, it is believed that for a number of years he was the head of thatOrder. In a little work called Lumen de Lumine, or A New Magical LightDiscovered and Communicated to the World, published in London in 1651, EugeniusPhilalethes gives a remarkable letter, presumably from the Rosicrucian Order.Accompanying the letter is an emblematic figure setting forth in symbolic formthe processes and formulae of the Philosopher’s Stone. This epistle is anexcellent example of the Rosicrucian system of combining abstract theologicalspeculations with concrete chemical formulae. With the aid of the materialcontained in various parts of this present book the student would do well to sethimself the task of solving the riddle contained in this hieroglyph.“A Letter from the Brothers of R. C. Concerning the Invisible, Magical Mountain,And the Treasure therein Contained.“Every man naturally desires a superiority, to have treasures of Gold and Silver[intellect and soul], and to seem great in the eyes of the world. God indeedcreated all things for the use of man, that he might rule over them, andacknowledge therein the singular goodness and omnipotence of God, give Himthanks for His benefits, honor Him and praise Him. But there is no man looksafter these things, otherwise than by spending his days idly; they would enjoythem without any previous labor and danger; neither do they look them out ofthat place where God hath treasured them up, Who expects also that man shouldseek for them there, and to those that seek will He give them. But there is notany that labors for a possession in that place, and therefore these riches arenot found: For the way to this place, and the place itself hath been unknown fora long time, and it is hidden from the greatest part of the world. Butnotwithstanding it be difficult and laborious to find out this way and place,yet the place should be sought after.“But it is not the will of God to conceal anything from those that are His, andtherefore in this last age, before the final judgment comes, all these thingsshall be manifested to those that are worthy: As He Himself (though obscurely,lest it should be manifested to the unworthy) hath spoken in a certain place:There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hidden that shall notbe known. We therefore being moved by the Spirit of God, do declare the will ofGod to the world, which we have also already performed and published in severallanguages. But most men either revile, or contemne that, our Manifesto, (theFama and Confessio Fraternitatis) or else waiving the Spirit of God, they expectthe proposals thereof from us, supposing we will straightway teach them how tomake gold by Art, or furnish them with ample treasures, whereby they may livepompously in the face of the world, swagger, and make wars, turn usurers,gluttons, and drunkards, live unchastely, and defile their whole life withseveral other sins, all which things are contrary to the blessed will of God.These men should have learned from those Ten Virgins (whereof five that werefoolish demanded oil for their lamps, from those five that were wise) how thatthe case is much otherwise.“It is expedient that every man should labor for this treasure by the assistanceof God, and his own particular search and industry. But the perverse intentionsof these fellows we understand out of their own writings, by the singular graceand revelation of God. We do stop our ears, and wrap ourselves as it were inclouds, to avoid the bellowings and howlings of those men, who in vain cry outfor gold. And hence indeed it comes to pass that they brand us with infinitecalumnies and slanders, which notwithstanding we do not resent but God in Hisgood time will judge them for it. But after that we had well known (thoughunknown to you) and perceived also by your writing how diligently you are toperuse the Holy Scripture, and seek the true knowledge of God: we have alsoabove many thousands, thought you worthy of some answer, and we signify thismuch to you by the will of God and the admonition of the Holy Ghost.“There is a mountain situated in the midst of the earth, or center of the world,which is both small and great. It is soft, also above measure hard and stony. Itis far off, and near at hand, but by the providence of God, invisible. In it arehidden most ample treasures, which the world is not able to value. This mountainby envy of the devil, who always opposeth the glory of God and the happiness ofman, is compassed about with very cruel beasts and other [sic] ravenous birds,which make the way thither both difficult and dangerous; and therefore hitherto,because the time is not yet come, the way thither could not be sought after norfound out. But now at last the way is to be found by those that are worthy, butnotwithstanding by every man’s self-labor and endeavors.“To this mountain you shall go in a certain night (when it comes) most long andmost dark, and see that you prepare yourselves by prayer. Insist upon the waythat leads to the mountain, but ask not of any man where the way lies: onlyfollow your Guide, who will offer himself to you, and will meet you in the waybut you shall not know him. This Guide will bring you to the mountain atmidnight, when all things are silent and dark. It is necessary that you armyourselves with a resolute heroic courage, lest you fear those things that willhappen, and so fall back. You need no sword, nor any other bodily weapons, onlycall upon God sincerely and heartily.“When you have discovered the mountain, the first miracle that will appear isthis. A most vehement and very great wind, that will shake the mountain andshatter the rocks to pieces. You shall be encountered also by lions and dragonsand other terrible beasts, but fear not any of these things. Be resolute andtake heed that you return not, for your Guide who brought you thither will notsuffer any evil to befall you. As for the treasure, it is not yet discovered butit is very near. After this wind will come an earthquake, that will overthrowthose things which the wind hath left and make all flat. But be sure that youfall not off.“The earthquake being past, there shall follow a fire, that will consume theearthly rubbish, and discover the treasure, but as yet you cannot see it. Afterall these things and near the daybreak there shall be a great calm, and youshall see the Day-Star arise and the dawning will appear, and you shall perceivea great treasure. The chiefest thing in it, and the most perfect, is a certainexalted tincture, with which the world (if it served God and were worthy of suchgifts) might be tinged and turned into most pure gold.“This tincture being used, as your Guide shall teach you, will make you youngwhen you are old, and you shall perceive no disease in any part of your bodies.By means of this tincture also you shall find pearls of that excellency whichcannot be imagined. But do not you arrogate anything to yourself because of yourpresent power, but be contented with that which your Guide shall communicate toyou. Praise God perpetually for this His gift, and have a special care that youuse it not for worldly pride, but employ it in such works which are contrary tothe world. Use it rightly and enjoy it so, as if you had it not. Live atemperate life, and beware of all sin, otherwise your Guide will forsake you,and you shall be deprived of this happiness. For know this of a truth, whosoeverabuseth this tincture and lives not exemplarly, purely, and devoutly before menhe shall lose this benefit, and scarce any hope will there be left ever torecover it afterwards.”If, as transcendentalists believe, the initiations into the Fraternity of theRose Cross were given in the invisible worlds which surround and interpene-trate the visible universe, it is not beyond the range of possibility that thisallegory is to be considered in the light of an initiatory ritual as well as analchemical formula.As has been noted, it is difficult to secure a complete formula for any of thealchemical operations. The one presented here is the most nearly complete of anyavailable. The collecting of the rays and energies of the celestial bodies asprecipitated in dew is a process which Paracelsus used with great success. Bearconstantly in mind that these processes are only for those who have beenproperly instructed in the secret art.“A TRUE REVELATION OF THE MANUAL OPERATION FOR THE UNIVERSAL MEDICINE COMMONLYCALLED ”THE PHILOSOPHER‘S STONE.’ By the celebrated philosopher of Leyden, asattested upon his deathbed with his own Blood, Anno Domini 1662. To my LovingCousin and Son, the True Hermetic Philosopher—“Dear Loving Cousin and Son:“Although I had resolved never to give in writing to any person the secret ofthe Ancient Sages, yet notwithstanding out of peculiar affection and love toyou, I have taken it upon me, to which the nearness of our relation obliges me,and especially because this temporal life is short, and Art is very dark and youmay therefore not attain the wished for end;—but my Son because so precious ajewel belongs not to swine; and also this so great a gift of God may be treatedcarefully and Christianlike, in consideration thereof I do so largely declaremyself to thee.“I conjure thee with hand and mouth sacredly;“1st. That most especially thou faithfully keep the same from all wicked,lustful and criminal persons.“2dly. That thou exalt not thyself in any way.“3dly. That thou seek to advance the honor of thy Creator of all things and thegood of thy neighbor, preserve it sacredly that thy Lord may not have cause tocomplain of thee at the last day. I have written here in this treatise such apart of the Kingdom of Heaven, just as I myself have worked this treasure andfinished it with my fingers, therefore I have subscribed all this work with myblood, lying on my deathbed in Leyden.“THE PROCESS—In the Name of God, take of the purest and cleanest salt, sea salt,so as it is made by the sun itself, if such as is brought by shipping fromSpain, (I used salt that came from St. Uber) let it be dried in a warm stove,grind it in a stone mortar, as fine as possible to a powder, that it may be somuch the easier dissolved and taken up by our Dew-water, which is thus to be hadin the months of May or June: When the Moon is at the full, observe when the dewfalls with an East or South East wind. Then you must have sticks about one and ahalf feet high above the ground when driven in the Earth. Upon two or three suchsticks, lay some four square plates of glass, and as the dew falls it easilyfastens on the glass like a vapour, then have glass Vessels in readiness, letthe dew drain from the sides of the glasses into your vessels. Do this until youhave enough. The full of the Moon is a good season, afterwards it will be hard.”The solar rays descending from the sun carry with them solar sulphur—the DivineFire. These rays are crystallized by contact with the lunar rays. The solar raysare also met by the emanations pouring upward from the earth’s surface and arethus still further crystallized into a partly tangible substance, which issoluble in pure water. This substance is the “Magical Mountain of the Moon”referred to in the R. C. letter. The crystallization of the solar and lunar raysin water (dew) produces the virgin earth—a pure, invisible substance,uncontaminated by material matter. When the virgin earth crystals are wet, theyappear green; when dry, white.Von Welling makes a suggestion for the extraction of the solar life fromstagnant water, but is reticent both as to naming the essence extracted and alsoas to the various processes through which it must pass to be refined andincreased in power. His hint, however, is both valuable and unusual:“Take sweet clean water and seal it in a large bottle, leaving about one-fourthempty. Place the bottle in the sun for some weeks until it rots, showing aprecipitation in the bottom. This precipitation, when properly manipulated bydistillation, will produce a clear, fiery, burning oil, the constituents and useof which are only known to the wise.”The philosopher of Leyden continues: “Now when you have enough of your dew closeyour glasses exactly, and keep it till you use it, that none of its spirits mayevaporate, which may easily happen. Set it therefore in a cool place, that nowarmth may come to it, or else the subtle spirit will rise and be gone; whichwill not so happen if after you have filled your glasses with Dew quite full,you close them very well with wax.“Now in the Name of God, take of this Dew-water as much as thou wilt, put in aclean dissolving glass, then cast a little of your forementioned powdered saltinto it to be dissolved, and continue to put it in till your Dew-water willdissolve no more or till the salt lies in it four days without being dissolved,then it has enough, and unto your Dew is given its proper powder. Of thiscompounded water, take as much as thou wilt, I took about a pound and a half,and put it into a round vial with a short neck, fill it with our water and luteit with a good lute, a cover and stopple that fits it well, that the subtle andliving spirit of the dew may not fume away, for if they should the soul of thesalt will never be stirred up, nor the work ever brought to a right end. Let thelute dry very well of itself, and set it in the furnace of B. M. to putrefy.Make a slow fire and let it digest for forty days or fifty, and that the fume ofthe water be continually round about it, and you will see your matter growblack, which is a token of its putrefaction.“As soon as you have taken it out, have your dry furnace ready. Set your glasswith the matter into an inner globe to coagulate, give it a slow degree of fire,continue it equally for twelve or fifteen days, and your matter will begin tocoagulate and to fasten round about your glass like a gray salt, which as soonas you see and before it be two days, slacken the fire that it may coolleisurely. Then have in readiness your putrefying furnace as before. Set yourglass therein and give the same degree of fire as before. Let it stand twelvedays, and again you will see the matter resolve and open as before, and openitself, but you must every time see that the lute and your glass is not hurt.When you set your glass in the putrefying furnace, take care that the neck ofyour glass is covered with a wooden or glass stopper that fits it exactly, thatthe moisture of the water may not come at it.“When you see it black set your glass as before to coagulate and when it beginsto be of a grayish color and whitish, set it in a third time to putrefy, andcoagulate to the fifth time, until you see that your water in its dissolution isclean, pellucid and clear, and that it appears in its Calcination of a finewhite like Snow. Then it is prepared and becomes a Salt fixed which will melt onhot Silver plate like wax; but before you set this your Salt out, set it again[in] the furnace of putrefaction that it may dissolve of itself, then let itcool, open your Glass and you will find your Matter lessened a third part. Butinstead of your former Salt Water you will have a fine Sweet and verypenetrating Water which the Philosophers have hid under very wonderful Names—Itis the Mercury of all true Philosophers, the Water out of which comes Gold andSilver, for they say its Father is Gold and its Mother is Silver. Thus hast thouthe strength of both these Luminaries conjoined in this Water, most true, in itsright Pondus.“Prescription. 5 Drops of this Water taken inwardly strengthens theunderstanding and memory, and opens to us most wonderful and sweet things, ofwhich no man hath heard, and of which I dare not further write, because of theOath I made God to the contrary. Time and the holy use of this blessed Waterwill teach us, as soon as you have taken it inwardly such influence will happento thee as if the whole heavens and all the stars with their powers are workingin thee. All Knowledge and secret Arts will be opened to thee as in a dream, butthe most excellent of all is, you will perfectly learn rightly to know allcreatures in their Nature, and by means thereof, the true understanding of God,the Creator of us, Heaven and Earth, like David and Moses and all the Saints ofGod, for the wisdom of our fountain of living Water will instruct thee as it didSolomon and the Brethren of our fraternity.”In his rare treatise on Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, von Welling discloses asecret not generally revealed in alchemical writings, namely, that thealchemists were concerned not only with the transmutation of metals but had acomplete cosmological and philosophical system based upon the Qabbalah.According to von Welling, the universal salt (in watery form) is a positive curefor all the physical ailments of mankind; it is in every living thing, but fromsome things it is more easily secured than from others: especially is this trueof virgin earth; it is the universal solvent, the alkahest. The same writer alsostates that in the first stages of its preparation this salt will cure any andall diseases of the heart. The anonymous philosopher of Leyden continues:“Would you now proceed further with our blessed Water to the forementionedintention of preparing a Tincture for Metals, hearken my Son—“Take in the NAME of the Lord, of thy Paradisiacal Water, of heavenly Water ofMercury, as much as thou wilt, put it into a Glass to dissolve, and set it in aslow heat of Ashes, that it may just feel the warmth, then have ready wellpurified Gold for the Red, or Silver for the White Elixir, for in both theProcesses are the same. Let your Gold or Silver be beaten as thin as leaf Gold,cast it by degrees into your dissolving Glass, that contains your blessed Water,as you did in the beginning with your Salt, and it will melt like Ice in WarmWater, and continue so to do till your Gold or Silver lie therein four dayswithout dissolving, then it has received its due Pondus. Then put thisdissolution as before into a round Glass, fill it two thirds parts full, seal ithermetically as before, let your Sigillum be well dried. Set it in the furnaceof Balneum Vapori, make a fire and let it remain forty days, as before, thenwill the Gold or Silver be dissolved radically and will turn of the deepestblack in the world, which as soon as you see, have your other drying furnace inreadiness.”Continuing: “Philosophers say there is no true solution of the body without aproceeding coagulation of the spirit, for they are interchangeably mixed in adue proportion, whereby the bodily essence becomes of a spiritual penetratingnature. On the other hand, the incomprehensible spiritual essential virtue isalso made corporeal by the fire, because there is made between them so near arelation or friendship, like as the heavens operate to the very Depth of Earth,and producing from thence all the treasures and riches of the whole World.“Admirandum Naturæ Operationem in Archidoxes Cognitam.“With this Powder—You may as follows project on metals. Take five parts of fineGold or Silver according as you work, and melt it in a Crucible. Wrap up yourMedicine in Wax, cast it therein, give a strong fire for an hour, then take theCrucible out, as it were, calcined, then cast one part on ten parts of imperfectmetals, be it what it will, and the same will be immediately changed into purerMetal, than what is brought out of the Mines and produced by Melting; and whenyou augment it in strength and virtue by resolving and coagulating, the fifthtime it will resolve itself in three days and be coagulated in twenty-four hourstime, to an incredible and most highly pellucid Stone or Red Shining burningCoal. For the white work it will become like a white stream of Lightning.“Of this last coagulation take one part, cast it upon five thousand of meltedGold or Silver as before. It changes the same into perfect Medicine, one partwhereof will tinge one hundred thousand parts of melted imperfect Metals intothe very finest Gold or Silver. So far I have brought and further I would notcome, for as I would set in the matter [to distill] six times in twelve hours,it subtilized so highly that the most part (like somewhat most wonderful tobehold) past through the Glass causing an inexpressible odoriferous Smell. Takeheed that it happens not to you.“Many more wonders of this holy Art might be added, namely how to preparetherewith all sorts of precious Stones, and other most admirable things, but itwould require too great a book to express the whole as it ought to be,especially as the Art is endless and not to be apprehended with one view, and mypurpose has been, Loving Cousin and Son, devoutly to lead thee into theMysteries of Nature and this holy Science, and I have faithfully performed it.”In conclusion, the letter states: “Go thou to work as I have done before thee,fear God, Love thy neighbour from the bottom of thy Soul sincerely. So will inthe Manual operation, everything to thee, and when thou art at work therein manyof our brethren will reveal themselves to thee, of our holy order, privately;For I have on my part by the Eternal God wrote the truth which I found out byprayer and searching into Nature, which work I have seen with my eyes, and withmy hands extracted. Therefore also I have subscribed this Testament with my ownblood, the last day of my Life on my deathbed. Actum Leyden, 27 March 1662.”"},{"pageContent":"XXXVII The Chemical Marriage The self-admitted author of The Chemical Marriage, Johann Valentin Andreæ, bornin Württemberg in 1586, was twenty-eight years of age when that work was firstpublished. It was presumably written about twelve years prior to itspublication—or when the author was fifteen or sixteen years old. The fact isalmost incredible that one so young could produce a volume containing the wealthof symbolic thought and philosophy hidden between the lines of The ChemicalMarriage. This book makes the earliest known reference to Christian Rosencreutz,and is generally regarded as the third of the series of original Rosicrucianmanifestoes. As a symbolic work, the book itself is hopelessly irreconcilablewith the statements made by Andreæ concerning it. The story of The ChemicalMarriage relates in detail a series of incidents occurring to an aged man,presumably the Father C.R.C. of the Fama and Confessio. If Father C.R.C. wasborn in 1378, as stated in the Confessio, and is identical with the ChristianRosencreutz of The Chemical Marriage, he was elevated to the dignity of a Knightof the Golden Stone in the eighty-first year of his life (1459). In the light ofhis own statements, it is inconceivable that Andreæ could have been Father RosyCross.Many figures found in the various books on symbolism published in the early partof the seventeenth century bear a striking resemblance to the characters andepisodes in The Chemical Marriage. The alchemical wedding may prove to be thekey to the riddle of Baconian Rosicrucianism. The presence in the German text ofThe Chemical Marriage of some words in English indicates its author to have beenconversant also with that language. The following summary of the main episodesof the seven days of The Chemical Marriage will give the reader a fairlycomprehensive idea of the profundity of its symbolism."},{"pageContent":"THE FIRST DAY Christian Rosencreutz, having prepared in his heart the Paschal Lamb togetherwith a small unleavened loaf, was disturbed while at prayer one evening beforeEaster by a violent storm which threatened to demolish not only his little housebut the very hill on which it stood. In the midst of the tempest he was touchedon the back and, turning, he beheld a glorious woman with wings filled witheyes, and robed in sky-colored garments spangled with stars. In one hand sheheld a trumpet and in the other a bundle of letters in every language. Handing aletter to C.R.C., she immediately ascended into the air, at the same timeblowing upon her trumpet a blast which shook the house. Upon the seal of theletter was a curious cross and the words In hoc signo vinces. Within, traced inletters of gold on an azure field, was an invitation to a royal wedding.C.R.C. was deeply moved by the invitation because it was the fulfillment of aprophecy which he had received seven years before, but so unworthy did he feelthat he was paralyzed with fear. At length, after resorting to prayer, he soughtsleep. In his dreams he found himself in a loathsome dungeon with a multitude ofother men, all bound and fettered with great chains. The grievousness of theirsufferings was increased as they stumbled over each other in the darkness.Suddenly from above came the sound of trumpets; the cover of the dungeon waslifted, and a ray of light pierced the gloom. Framed in the light stood ahoary-headed man who announced that a rope would be lowered seven times andwhoever could cling to the rope would be drawn up to freedom.Great confusion ensued. All sought to grasp the rope and many were pulled awayfrom it by others. C.R.C. despaired of being saved, but suddenly the rope swungtowards him and, grasping it, he was raised from the dungeon. An aged womancalled the “Ancient Matron” wrote in a golden yellow book the names of thosedrawn forth, and each of the redeemed was given for remembrance a piece of goldbearing the symbol of the sun and the letters DLS. C.R.C., who had been injuredwhile clinging to the rope, found it difficult to walk. The aged woman bade himnot to worry, but to thank God who had permitted him to come into so high alight. Thereupon trumpets sounded and C.R.C. awoke, but so vivid was the dreamthat he was still sensible of the wounds received while asleep.With renewed faith C.R.C. arose and prepared himself for the Hermetic Marriage.He donned a white linen coat and bound a red ribbon crosswise over hisshoulders. In his hat he stuck four roses and for food he carried bread, water,and salt. Before leaving his cottage, he knelt and vowed that whatever knowledgewas revealed to him he would devote to the service of his neighbor. He thendeparted from his house with joy."},{"pageContent":"THE SECOND DAY As he entered the forest surrounding his little house, it seemed to C.R.C. thatall Nature had joyously prepared for the wedding. As he proceeded singingmerrily, he came to a green heath in which stood three great cedars, one bearinga tablet with an inscription describing the four paths that led to the palace ofthe King: the first short and dangerous, the second circuitous, the third apleasant and royal road, and the fourth suitable only for incorruptible bodies.Weary and perplexed, C.R.C. decided to rest and, cutting a slice of bread, wasabout to partake thereof when a white dove begged it from him. The dove was atonce attacked by a raven, and in his efforts to separate the birds C.R.C.unknowingly ran a considerable distance along one of the four paths—that leadingsouthward. A terrific wind preventing him from retracing his steps, the weddingguest resigned himself to the loss of his bread and continued along the roaduntil he espied in the distance a great gate. The sun being low, he hastenedtowards the portal, upon which, among other figures, was a tablet bearing thewords Procul hinc procul ite profani.A gatekeeper in sky-colored habit immediately asked C.R.C. for his letter ofinvitation and, on receiving it, bade him enter and requested that he purchase atoken. After describing himself as a Brother of the Red Rosie Cross, C.R.C.received in exchange for his water bottle a golden disk bearing the letters S C.Night drawing near, the wanderer hastened on to a second gate, guarded by alion, and to which was affixed a tablet with the words Date et dabitur volis,where he presented a letter given him by the first gatekeeper. Being urged topurchase a token bearing the letters S M, he gave his little package of salt andthen hastened on to reach the palace gates before they were locked for thenight.A beautiful virgin called Virgo Lucifera was extinguishing the castle lights asC.R.C. approached, and he was barely able to squeeze through the closing gates.As they closed they caught part of his coat, which he was forced to leavebehind. Here his name was written in the Lord Bridegroom’s little vellum bookand he was presented with a new pair of shoes and also a token bearing theletters S P N. He was then conducted by pages to a small chamber where the“ice-grey locks” were cut from the crown of his head by invisible barbers, afterwhich he was ushered into a spacious hall where a goodly number of kings,princes, and commoners were assembled. At the sound of trumpets each seatedhimself at the table, taking a position corresponding to his dignity, so thatC.R.C. received a very humble seat. Most of the pseudo-philosophers presentbeing vain pretenders, the banquet became an orgy, which, however, suddenlyceased at the sound of stately and inspired music. For nearly half an hour noone spoke. Then amidst a great sound the door of the dining hall swung open andthousands of lighted tapers held by invisible hands entered. These were followedby the two pages lighting the beautiful Virgo Lucifera seated on a self-movingthrone. The white-and-gold-robed Virgin then rose and announced that to preventthe admission of unworthy persons to the mystical wedding a set of scales wouldbe erected the following day upon which each guest would be weighed to determinehis integrity: Those unwilling to undergo this ordeal she stated should remainin the dining hall. She then withdrew, but many of the tapers stayed toaccompany the guests to their quarters for the night.Most of those present were presumptuous enough to believe that they could besafely weighed, but nine—including C.R.C.—felt their shortcomings so deeply thatthey feared the outcome and remained in the hall while the others were led awayto their sleeping chambers. These nine were bound with ropes and left alone indarkness. C.R.C. then dreamed that he saw many men suspended over the earth bythreads, and among them flew an aged man who, cutting here and there a thread,caused many to fall to earth. Those who in arrogance had soared to lofty heightsaccordingly fell a greater distance and sustained more serious injury than themore humble ones who, falling but a short distance, often landed without mishap.Considering this dream to be a good omen, C.R.C. related it to a companion,continuing in discourse with him until dawn."},{"pageContent":"THE THIRD DAY Soon after dawn the trumpets sounded and the Virgo Lucifera, arrayed in redvelvet, girded with a white sash, and crowned with a laurel wreath, enteredaccompanied by two hundred men in red and-white livery. She intimated to C.R.C.and his eight companions that they might fare better than the other,self-satisfied guests. Golden scales were then hung in the midst of the hall andnear them were placed seven weights, one good-sized, four small, and two verylarge. The men in livery, each carrying a naked sword and a strong rope, weredivided into seven groups and from each group was chosen a captain, who wasgiven charge of one of the weights. Having remounted her high throne, VirgoLucifera ordered the ceremony to begin. The first to step on the scales was anemperor so virtuous that the balances did not tip until six weights had beenplaced upon the opposite end. He was therefore turned over to the sixth group.The rich and poor alike stood upon the scales, but only a few passed the testsuccessfully. To these were given velvet robes and wreaths of laurel, afterwhich they were seated upon the steps of Virgo Lucifera’s throne. Those whofailed were ridiculed and scourged.The “inquisition” being finished, one of the captains begged Virgo Lucifera topermit the nine men who had declared themselves unworthy also to be weighed, andthis caused C.R.C. anguish and fear. Of the first seven one succeeded and wasgreeted with joy. C.R.C. was the eighth and he not only withstood all theweights but even when three men hung on the opposite end of the beam he couldnot be moved. A page cried out: “THAT IS HE!” C.R.C. was quickly set at libertyand permitted to release one of the captives. He chose the first emperor. VirgoLucifera then requested the red roses that C.R.C. carried, which he immediatelygave her. The ceremony of the scales ended about ten o’clock in the forenoon.After agreeing upon the penalties to be imposed upon those whose shortcomingshad been thus exposed, a dinner was served to all. The few successful “artists,”including C.R.C., were given the chief seats, after which the Golden Fleece anda Flying Lion were bestowed upon them in the name of the Bridegroom. VirgoLucifera then presented a magnificent goblet to the guests, stating that theKing had requested all to share its contents. Following this, C.R.C. and hiscompanions were taken out upon a scaffolding where they beheld the variouspenalties suffered by those who failed. Before leaving the palace, each of therejected guests was given a draught of forgetfulness. The elect then returned tothe castle, where to each was assigned a learned page, who conducted themthrough the various parts of the edifice. C.R.C. saw many things his companionswere not privileged to behold, including the Royal Sepulcher, where he learned“more than is extant in all books.” He also visited a magnificent library and anobservatory containing a great globe thirty feet in diameter and with all thecountries of the world marked upon it.At supper the various guests propounded enigmas and C.R.C. solved the riddlewhich Virgo Lucifera asked concerning her own identity. Then entered the dininghall two youths and six virgins beautifully robed, followed by a seventh virginwearing a coronet. The latter was called the Duchess, and was mistaken for theHermetic Bride. The Duchess told C.R.C. that he had received more than theothers, therefore should make a greater return. The Duchess then asked each ofthe virgins to pick up one of the seven weights which still remained in thegreat room. To Virgo Lucifera was given the heaviest weight, which was hung inthe Queen’s chamber during the singing of a hymn. In the second chamber thefirst virgin hung her weight during a similar ceremony; thus they proceeded fromroom to room until the weights had been disposed of. The Duchess then presentedher hand to C.R.C. and his companions and, followed by her virgins, withdrew.Pages then conducted the guests to their sleeping chambers. The one assigned toC.R.C. was hung with rare tapestries and with beautiful paintings."},{"pageContent":"THE FOURTH DAY After washing and drinking in the garden from a fountain which bore severalinscriptions—among them one reading, “Drink, brothers, and live”—the guests, ledby Virgo Lucifera, ascended the 365 steps of the royal winding stairs. Theguests were given wreaths of laurel and, a curtain being raised, foundthemselves in the presence of the King and Queen. C.R.C. was awestruck by theglory of the throne room and especially by the magnificence of the Queen’srobes, which were so dazzling that he could not gaze upon them. Each guest waspresented to the King by one of the virgins and after this ceremony the VirgoLucifera made a short speech in which she recited the achievements of the honest“artists” and begged that each be questioned as to whether she had properlyfulfilled her duty. Old Atlas then stepped forward and in the name of theirRoyal Majesties greeted the intrepid band of philosophers and assured VirgoLucifera that she should receive a royal reward.The length of the throne room was five times its width. To the west was a greatporch in which stood three thrones, the central one elevated. On each throne sattwo persons: on the first an ancient king with a young consort; on the third ablack king with a veiled matron beside him; and on the central throne two youngpersons over whose heads hung a large and costly crown, about which hovered alittle Cupid who shot his arrows first at the two lovers and then about thehall. Before the Queen a book bound in black velvet lay on a small altar, onwhich were golden decorations. Beside this were a burning candle, a celestialglobe, a small striking-watch, a little crystal pipe from which ran a stream ofclear blood-red liquor, and a skull with a white serpent crawling in and out ofthe orbits. After their presentations, the guests retired down the windingstairs to the great hall.Later the Virgo Lucifera announced that a comedy was to be performed for thebenefit of the six royal guests in a building called the House of the Sun.C.R.C. and his companions formed part of the royal procession, which after aconsiderable walk arrived at the theater. The play was in seven acts, and afterits happy ending all returned through the garden and up the winding stairs tothe throne room. C.R.C. noticed the young King was very sad and that at thebanquet following he often sent meat to the white serpent in the skull. Thefeast over, the young King, holding in his hand the little black book from thealtar, asked the guests if they would all be true to him through prosperity andadversity, and when they tremblingly agreed he asked that each should sign hisname in the little black book as proof of his fealty. The royal persons thendrank from the little crystal fountain, the others afterwards doing likewise.This was called the “Draught of Silence.” The royal persons then sadly shookhands with all present. Suddenly a little bell tinkled and immediately the kingsand queens took off their white garments and donned black ones, the room washung in sable draperies, and the tables were removed. The eyes of the royalpersons were bound with six black taffeta scarfs and six coffins were placed inthe center of the room. An executioner, a Moor, robed in black and bearing anaxe, entered, and beheaded in turn each of the six royal persons. The blood ofeach was caught in a golden goblet, which was placed in the coffins with thebody. The executioner was also decapitated and his head placed in a small chest.The Virgo Lucifera, after assuring C.R.C. and his companions that all should bewell if they were faithful and true, ordered the pages to conduct them to theirrooms for the night while she remained to watch with the dead. About midnightC.R.C. awakened suddenly and, looking from his window, beheld seven shipssailing upon a lake. Above each hovered a flame; these he believed to be thespirits of the beheaded. When the ships reached shore, the Virgo Lucifera metthem and on each of six of the vessels was placed a covered coffin. As soon asthe coffins had been thus disposed of, the lights were extinguished and theflames passed back over the lake so that there remained but one light for awatch in each ship. After beholding this strange ceremony, C.R.C. returned tohis bed and slept till morning."},{"pageContent":"THE FIFTH DAY Rising at daybreak and entreating his page to show him other treasures of thepalace, C.R.C. was conducted down many steps to a great iron door bearing acurious inscription, which he carefully copied. Passing through, he foundhimself in the royal treasury, the light in which came entirely from some hugecarbuncles. In the center stood the triangular sepulcher of Lady Venus. Liftinga copper door in the pavement, the page ushered C.R.C. into a crypt where stooda great bed upon which, when his guide had raised the coverlets, C.R.C. beheldthe body of Venus. Led by his page, C.R.C. then rejoined his companions, sayingnothing to them of his experience.223 [images/00224.jpg] THE UNIVERSE CREATED BY THE DUAL PRINCIPLE OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS.The Supreme Deity is symbolized by the small globe at the top, which is dividedinto two hemispheres, the dark half representing the divine darkness with whichthe Deity surrounds Himself and which serves as His hiding place. The radianthemisphere signifies the divine light which is in God and which, pouring forth,manifests as the objective creative power. The large dark globe to the left andbeneath the dark half of the upper sphere signifies the potential darkness whichwas upon the face of the primordial deep and within which moved the Spirit ofGod. The light globe to the right is the Deity who is revealed out of thedarkness. Here the shining Word has dissipated the shadows and a gloriousuniverse has been formed. The divine power of this radiant globe is cognizableto man as the sun. The large central sphere divided horizontally into a lightand a dark section represents the created universe partaking of the light anddarkness which are in the nature of the Creator. The dark half represents theDeep, or Chaos, the Eternal Waters pouring forth out of the Deity; the lighthalf, the power of God which animates the waters and establishes order in Chaos.The light half-circle containing the figure of Apollo represents the diurnalhemisphere of the world, which the ancient Mysteries was ruled over by Apollo.The dark half-circle is the nocturnal hemisphere ruled over by Dionysius(Dionysos), whose figure is faintly visible in the gloom. Virgo Lucifera, robed in black velvet and accompanied by her virgins, then ledthe guests out into the courtyard where stood six coffins, each with eightpall-bearers. C.R.C. was the only one of the group of “artists” who suspectedthe royal bodies were no longer in these coffins. The coffins were lowered intograves and great stones rolled over them. The Virgo Lucifera then made a shortoration in which she exhorted each to assist in restoring the royal persons tolife, declaring that they should journey with her to the Tower of Olympus, wherethe medicines necessary to the resurrection of the six royal persons could alonebe found. C.R.C. and his companions followed Virgo Lucifera to the seashore,where all embarked on seven ships disposed according to a certain strange order.As the ships sailed across the lake and through a narrow channel into the opensea, they were attended by sirens, nymphs, and sea goddesses, who in honor ofthe wedding presented a great and beautiful pearl to the royal couple. When theships came in sight of the Tower of Olympus, Virgo Lucifera ordered thedischarge of cannon to signal their approach. Immediately a white flag appearedupon the tower and a small gilded pinnace, containing an ancient man—the wardenof the tower—with his white-clad guards came out to meet the ships.The Tower of Olympus stood upon an island which was exactly square and wassurrounded by a great wall. Entering the gate, the group was led to the bottomof the central tower, which contained an excellent laboratory where the guestswere fain to beat and wash plants, precious stones, and all sorts of things,extract their juice and essence, and put these latter into glasses. VirgoLucifera set the “artists” to work so arduously that they felt they were meredrudges. When the day’s work was finished, each was assigned a mattress on thestone floor. Being unable to sleep, C.R.C. wandered about contemplating thestars. Chancing upon a flight of steps leading to the top of the wall, heclimbed up and looked out upon the sea. Remaining here for some time, aboutmidnight he beheld seven flames which, passing over the sea towards him,gathered themselves on the top of the spire of the central tower. Simultaneouslythe winds arose, the sea became tempestuous, and the moon was covered withclouds. With some fear C.R.C. ran down the stairs and returned to the tower and,lying down on his mattress, was lulled to sleep by the sound of a gently flowingfountain in the laboratory."},{"pageContent":"THE SIXTH DAY The next morning the aged warden of the tower, after examining the workperformed by the wedding guests in the laboratory and finding it satisfactory,caused ladders, ropes, and large wings to be brought forth, and addressed theassembled “artists” thus: “My dear sons, one of these three things must each ofyou this day constantly bear about with him.” Lots were cast and to C.R.C., muchto his chagrin, fell a heavy ladder. Those who secured wings had them fastenedto their backs so cunningly that it was impossible to detect that they wereartificial. The aged warden then locked the “artists” in the lower room of thetower, but in a short time a round hole was uncovered in the ceiling and VirgoLucifera invited all to ascend. Those with wings flew at once through theopening, those with ropes had many difficulties, while C.R.C. with his laddermade reasonable speed. On the second floor the wedding guests, musicians, andVirgo Lucifera gathered about a fountain-like contrivance containing the bodiesof the six royal persons.Virgo Lucifera then placed the Moor’s head in a kettle-like receptacle in theupper part of the fountain and poured upon it the substances prepared on theprevious day in the laboratory. The virgins placed lamps beneath. Thesesubstances when they boiled passed out through holes in the sides of the kettleand, falling upon the bodies in the fountain below, dissolved them. The sixroyal bodies having been reduced thus to a liquid state, a tap was opened in thelower end of the fountain and the fluid drained into an immense golden globe,which, when filled, was of great weight. All but the wedding guests then retiredand shortly a hole in the ceiling opened as before and the guests ascendedpell-mell to the third floor. Here the globe were suspended by a strong chain.The walls of the apartment were of glass, and mirrors were so arranged that thesun’s rays were concentrated upon the central globe, thus causing it to becomevery hot. Later the sun’s rays were deflected and the globe permitted to cool,after which it was cut open with a diamond, revealing a beautiful white egg.Carrying this with her, Virgo Lucifera departed.The guests, having ascended through another trap door, found themselves upon thefourth floor, where stood a square kettle filled with silver sand warmed by agentle fire. The great white egg was placed upon the warm sand to mature. In ashort time it cracked and there emerged an ugly, ill-tempered bird, which wasfed with the blood of the beheaded royal persons diluted with prepared water. Ateach feeding its feathers changed color; from black they turned to white and atlast they became varicolored, the disposition of the bird improving the while.Dinner was then served, after which Virgo Lucifera departed with the bird. Theguests ascended with ropes, ladders, and wings to the fifth floor, when a bathcolored with fine white powder had been prepared for the bird, which enjoyedbathing in it until the lamps placed beneath the bath caused the water to becomeuncomfortably warm. When the heat had removed all the bird’s feathers it wastaken out, but the fire continued until nothing remained in the bath save asediment in the form of a blue stone. This was later pounded up and made into apigment; with this, all of the bird except the head was painted.The guests thereupon ascended to the sixth floor, where stood a small altarresembling that in the King’s throne room. The bird drank from the littlefountain and was fed with the blood of the white serpent which crawled throughthe openings in the skull. The sphere by the altar revolved continuously. Thewatch struck one, two, and then three, at which time the bird, laying its neckupon the book, suffered itself to be decapitated. Its body was burned to ashes,which were placed in a box of cypress wood. Virgo Lucifera told C.R.C. and threeof his comrades that they were lazy and sluggish “labourators” and wouldtherefore be excluded from the seventh room. Musicians were sent for, who withcornets were to “blow” the four in ridicule from the chamber. C.R.C. and histhree companions were disheartened until the musicians told them to be of goodcheer and led them up a winding stair to the eighth floor of the tower directlybeneath the roof. Here the old warden, standing upon a little round furnace,welcomed them and congratulated them upon being chosen by Virgo Lucifera forthis greater work. Virgo Lucifera then entered, and after laughing at theperplexity of her guests, emptied the ashes of the bird into another vessel,filling the cypress box with useless matter. She thereupon returned to theseventh floor, presumably to mislead those assembled there by setting them towork upon the false ashes in the box.C.R.C. and his three friends were set to work moistening the bird’s ashes withspecially prepared water until the mixture became of doughlike consistency,after which it was heated and molded into two miniature forms. Later these wereopened, disclosing two bright and almost transparent human images about fourinches high (homunculi), one male and the other female. These tiny forms werelaid upon satin cushions and fed drop by drop with the blood of the bird untilthey grew to normal size and of great beauty. Though the bodies had theconsistency of flesh, they showed no signs of life, for the soul was not inthem. The bodies were next surrounded with torches and their faces covered withsilk. Virgo Lucifera then appeared, bearing two curious white garments. Thevirgins also entered, among them six bearing great trumpets. A trumpet wasplaced upon the mouth of one of the two figures and C.R.C. saw a tiny hole openin the dome of the tower and a ray of light descend through the tube of thetrumpet and enter the body. This process was repeated three times on each body.The two newly ensouled forms were then removed upon a traveling couch. In abouthalf an hour the young King and Queen awakened and the Virgo Lucifera presentedthem with the white garments. These they donned and the King in his own personmost graciously returned thanks to C.R.C. and his companions, after which theroyal persons departed upon a ship. C.R.C. and his three privileged friends thenrejoined the other “artists,” making no mention of that which they had seen.Later the entire party were assigned handsome chambers, where they rested tillmorning."},{"pageContent":"THE SEVENTH DAY In the morning Virgo Lucifera announced that each of the wedding guests hadbecome a “Knight of the Golden Stone.” The aged warden then presented each manwith a gold medal, bearing on one side the inscription “Ar. Nat. Mi.” and on theother, “Tem. Na. F.” The entire company returned in twelve ships to the King’spalace. The flags on the vessels bore the signs of the zodiac, and C.R.C. satunder that of Libra. As they entered the lake, many ships met them and the Kingand Queen, together with their lords, ladies, and virgins, rode forth on agolden barge to greet the returning guests. Atlas then made a short oration inthe King’s behalf, also asking for the royal presents. In reply the aged wardendelivered to Cupid, who hovered about the royal pair, a small, curious-shapedcasket. C.R.C. and the old lord, each bearing a snow-white ensign with a redcross on it, rode in the carriage with the King. At the first gate stood theporter with blue clothes, who, upon seeing C.R.C., begged him to intercede withthe King to release him from that post of servitude. The King replied that theporter was a famous astrologer who was forced to keep the gate as a punishmentfor the crime of having gazed upon Lady Venus reposing upon her couch. The Kingfurther declared that the porter could be released only when another was foundwho had committed the same crime. Upon hearing this, C.R.C.’s heart sank, for herealized himself to be the culprit, but he remained silent at that time.The newly created Knights of the Golden Stone were obliged to subscribe to fivearticles drawn up by His Royal Highness: (1) That they would ascribe their Orderonly to God and His handmaid, Nature. (2) That they should abominate alluncleanness and vice. (3) That they should always be ready to assist the worthyand needy. (4) That they should not use their knowledge and power for theattainment of worldly dignity. (5) That they should not desire to live longerthan God had decreed. They were then duly installed as Knights, which ceremonywas ratified in a little chapel where C.R.C. hung up his Golden Fleece and hishat for an eternal memorial, and here he inscribed the following: Summa Scientianihil Scire, Fr. Christianus Rosencreutz. Eques aurei Lapidis. Anno 1459.After the ceremony, C.R.C. admitted that he was the one who had beheld Venus andconsequently must become the porter of the gate. The King embraced him fondlyand he was assigned to a great room containing three beds—one for himself, onefor the aged lord of the tower, and the third for old Atlas. The ChemicalMarriage here comes to an abrupt end, leaving the impression that C.R.C. was toassume his duties as porter on the following morning. The book ends in themiddle of a sentence, with a note in italics presumably by the editor.Under the symbolism of an alchemical marriage, mediæval philosophers concealedthe secret system of spiritual culture whereby they hoped to coordinate thedisjecta membra of both the human and social organisms. Society, theymaintained, was a threefold structure and had its analogy in the triuneconstitution of man, for as man consists of spirit, mind, and body, so societyis made up of the church, the state, and the populace. The bigotry of thechurch, the tyranny of the state, and the fury of the mob are the threemurderous agencies of society which seek to destroy Truth as recounted in theMasonic legend of Hiram Abiff. The first six days of The Chemical Marriage setforth the processes of philosophical “creation” through which every organismmust pass. The three kings are the threefold spirit of man and their consortsthe corresponding vehicles of their expression in the lower world. Theexecutioner is the mind, the higher part of which—symbolized by the head—isnecessary to the achievement of the philosophical labor. Thus the parts ofman—by the alchemists symbolized as planets and elements—when blended togetheraccording to a certain Divine formula result in the creation of two philosophic“babes” which, fed upon the blood of the alchemical bird, become rulers of theworld.From an ethical standpoint, the young King and Queen resurrected at the summitof the tower and ensouled by Divine Life represent the forces of Intelligenceand Love which must ultimately guide society. Intelligence and Love are the twogreat ethical luminaries of the world and correspond to enlightened spirit andregenerated body. The bridegroom is reality and the bride the regenerated beingwho attains perfection by becoming one with reality through a cosmic marriagewherein the mortal part attains immortality by being united with its ownimmortal Source. In the Hermetic Marriage divine and human consciousness areunited in holy wedlock and he in whom this sacred ceremony takes place isdesignated as “Knight of the Golden Stone”; he thereby becomes a divinephilosophic diamond composed of the quintessence of his own sevenfoldconstitution.Such is the true interpretation of the mystical process of becoming “a bride ofthe Lamb.” The Lamb of God is signified by the Golden Fleece that Jason wasforced to win before he could assume his kingship. The Flying Lion is illuminedwill, an absolute prerequisite to the achievement of the Great Work. The episodeof weighing the souls of men has its parallel in the ceremony described in theEgyptian Book of the Dead. The walled city entered by C.R.C. represents thesanctuary of wisdom wherein dwell the real rulers of the world—the initiatedphilosophers.Like the ancient Mysteries after which it was patterned, the Order of the RoseCross possessed a secret ritual which was lived by the candidate for aprescribed number of years before he was eligible to the inner degrees of thesociety. The various floors of the Tower of Olympus represent the orbits of theplanets. The ascent of the philosophers from one floor to another also parallelscertain rituals of the Eleusinian Mysteries and the rites of Mithras wherein thecandidate ascended the seven rungs of a ladder or climbed the seven steps of apyramid in order to signify release from the influences of the PlanetaryGovernors. Man becomes master of the seven spheres only when he transmutes theimpulses received from them. He who masters the seven worlds and is reunitedwith the Divine Source of his own nature consummates the Hermetic Marriage."},{"pageContent":"XXXVIII Bacon, Shakspere, and the Rosicrucians The present consideration of the Bacon-Shakspere-Rosicrucian controversy isundertaken not for the vain purpose of digging up dead men’s bones but rather inthe hope that a critical analysis will aid in the rediscovery of that knowledgelost to the world since the oracles were silenced. It was W.F.C. Wigston whocalled the Bard of Avon “phantom Captain Shake- speare, the Rosicrucian mask.”This constitutes one of the most significant statements relating to theBacon-Shakspere controversy.It is quite evident that William Shakspere could not, unaided, have produced theimmortal writings bearing his name. He did not possess the necessary literaryculture, for the town of Stratford where he was reared contained no schoolcapable of imparting the higher forms of learning reflected in the writingsascribed to him. His parents were illiterate, and in his early life he evinced atotal disregard for study. There are in existence but six known examples ofShakspere’s handwriting. All are signatures, and three of them are in his will.The scrawling, uncertain method of their execution stamps Shakspere asunfamiliar with the use of a pen, and it is obvious either that he copied asignature prepared for him or that his hand was guided while he wrote. Noautograph manuscripts of the “Shakespearian” plays or sonnets have beendiscovered, nor is there even a tradition concerning them other than thefantastic and impossible statement appearing in the foreword of the Great Folio.A well-stocked library would be an essential part of the equipment of an authorwhose literary productions demonstrate him to be familiar with the literature ofall ages, yet there is no record that Shakspere ever possessed a library, nordoes he make any mention of books in his will. Commenting on the knownilliteracy of Shakspere’s daughter Judith, who at twenty-seven could only makeher mark, Ignatius Donnelly declares it to be unbelievable that WilliamShakspere if he wrote the plays bearing his name would have permitted his owndaughter to reach womanhood and marry without being able to read one line of thewritings that made her father wealthy and locally famous.224 [images/00225.jpg] HEADPIECE SHOWING LIGHT AND SHADED A’S.The ornamental headpiece shown above has long been considered a Baconian orRosicrucian signature. The light and the dark A’s appear in several volumespublished by emissaries of the Rosicrucians. If the above figure be comparedwith that from Alciati Emblemata on the following page, the cryptic use of thetwo A’s will be further demonstrated. The query also has been raised, “Where did William Shakspere secure hisknowledge of modem French, Italian, Spanish, and Danish, to say nothing ofclassical Latin and Greek?” For, in spite of the rare discrimination with whichLatin is used by the author of the Shakespearian plays, Ben Jonson, who knewShakspere intimately, declared that the Stratford actor understood “small Latinand less Greek”! It is not also more than strange that no record exists ofWilliam Shakspere’s having ever played a leading role in the famous dramas he issupposed to have written or in others produced by the company of which he was anumber? True, he may have owned a small interest in the Globe Theatre orBlackfriars, but apparently the height of his thespian achievements was theGhost in Hamlet!In spite of his admitted avarice, Shakspere seemingly made no effort during hislifetime to control or secure remuneration from the plays bearing his name, manyof which were first published anonymously As far as can be ascertained, none ofhis heirs were involved in any manner whatsoever in the printing of the FirstFolio after his death, nor did they benefit financially therefrom. Had he beentheir author, Shakspere’s manuscripts and unpublished plays would certainly haveconstituted his most valued possessions, yet his will—while making specialdisposition of his second-best and his “broad silver gilt bowl”—neither mentionsnor intimates that he possessed any literary productions whatsoever.While the Folios and Quartos usually are signed “William Shakespeare,” all theknown autographs of the Stratford actor read “William Shakspere.” Does thischange in spelling contain any significance heretofore generally overlooked?Furthermore, if the publishers of the First Shakespearian Folio revered theirfellow actor as much as their claims in that volume would indicate, why didthey, as if in ironical allusion to a hoax which they were perpetrating, placean evident caricature of him on the title page?Certain absurdities also in Shakspere’s private life are irreconcilable. Whilesupposedly at the zenith of his literary career, he was actually engaged inbuying malt, presumably for a brewing business! Also picture the immortalShakspere—the reputed author of The Merchant of Venice—as a moneylender! Yetamong those against whom Shakspere brought action to collect petty sums was afellow townsman—one Philip Rogers—whom he sued for an unpaid loan of twoshillings, or about forty-eight cents! In short, there is nothing known in thelife of Shakspere that would justify the literary excellence imputed to him.225 [images/00226.jpg] THE TITLE PAGE OF BURTON’S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY.Baconian experts declare Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy to be in reality FrancisBacon’s scrapbook in which he gathered strange and rare bits of knowledge duringthe many years of his eventful life. This title page has long been supposed tocontain a cryptic message. The key to this cipher is the pointing figure of themaniac in the lower right-hand corner of the design. According to Mrs. ElizabethWells Gallup, the celestial globe at which the maniac is pointing is a crypticsymbol of Sir Francis Bacon. The planetary signs which appear in the cloudsopposite the marginal figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 signify the planetaryconfigurations which produce the forms of mania depicted. The seated man, withhis head resting upon his hand, is declared by Baconian enthusiasts to representSir Francis Bacon. The philosophic ideals promulgated throughout the Shakespearian plays distinctlydemonstrate their author to have been thoroughly familiar with certain doctrinesand tenets peculiar to Rosicrucianism; in fact the profundity of theShakespearian productions stamps their creator as one of the illuminati of theages. Most of those seeking a solution for the Bacon-Shakspere controversy havebeen intellectualists. Notwithstanding their scholarly attainments, they haveoverlooked the important part played by transcendentalism in the philosophicachievements of the ages. The mysteries of superphysics are inexplicable to thematerialist, whose training does not equip him to estimate the extent of theirramifications and complexities. Yet who but a Platonist, a Qabbalist, or aPythagorean could have written The Tempest, Macbeth, Hamlet, or The Tragedy ofCymbeline? Who but one deeply versed in Paracelsian lore could have conceived AMidsummer Night’s Dream?Father of modern science, remodeler of modern law, editor of the modern Bible,patron of modern democracy, and one of the founders of modern Freemasonry, SirFrancis Bacon was a man of many aims and purposes. He was a Rosicrucian, somehave intimated the Rosicrucian. If not actually the Illustrious Father C.R.C.referred to in the Rosicrucian manifestoes, he was certainly a high initiate ofthe Rosicrucian Order, and it is his activities in connection with this secretbody that are of prime importance to students of symbolism, philosophy, andliterature.Scores of volumes have been written to establish Sir Francis Bacon as the realauthor of the plays and sonnets popularly ascribed to William Shakspere. Animpartial consideration of these documents cannot but convince the open-mindedof the verisimilitude of the Baconian theory. In fact those enthusiasts who foryears have struggled to identify Sir Francis Bacon as the true “Bard of Avon”might long since have won their case had they emphasized its most importantangle, namely, that Sir Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucian initiate, wrote into theShakespearian plays the secret teachings of the Fraternity of R.C. and the truerituals of the Freemasonic Order, of which order it may yet be discovered thathe was the actual founder. A sentimental world, however, dislikes to give up atraditional hero, either to solve a controversy or to right a wrong.Nevertheless, if it can be proved that by raveling out the riddle there can bediscovered information of practical value to mankind, then the best minds of theworld will cooperate in the enterprise. The Bacon-Shakspere controversy, as itsmost able advocates realize, involves the most profound aspects of science,religion, and ethics; he who solves its mystery may yet find therein the key tothe supposedly lost wisdom of antiquity.It was in recognition of Bacon’s intellectual accomplishments that King Jamesturned over to him the translators’ manuscripts of what is now known as the KingJames Bible for the presumable purpose of checking, editing, and revising them.The documents remained in his hands for nearly a year, but no information is tobe had concerning what occurred in that time. Regarding this work, William T.Smedley writes: “It will eventually be proved that the whole scheme of theAuthorised Version of the Bible was Francis Bacon’s.” (See The Mystery ofFrancis Bacon.) The first edition of the King James Bible contains a crypticBaconian headpiece. Did Bacon cryptographically conceal in the Authorized Biblethat which he dared not literally reveal in the text—the secret Rosicrucian keyto mystic and Masonic Christianity?Sir Francis Bacon unquestionably possessed the range of general andphilosophical knowledge necessary to write the Shakespearian plays and sonnets,for it is usually conceded that he was a composer, lawyer, and linguist. Hischaplain, Doctor William Rawley, and Ben Jonson both attest his philosophic andpoetic accomplishments. The former pays Bacon this remarkable tribute: “I havebeen enduced to think that if there were a beame of knowledge derived from Godupon any man in these modern times, it was upon him. For though he was a greatreader of books; yet he had not his knowledge from books but from some groundsand notions from within himself.” (See Introduction to the Resuscitatio.)Sir Francis Bacon, being not only an able barrister but also a polishedcourtier, also possessed that intimate knowledge of parliamentary law and theetiquette of the royal court revealed in the Shakespearian plays which couldscarcely have been acquired by a man in the humble station of the Stratfordactor. Lord Verulam furthermore visited many of the foreign countries formingthe background for the plays and was therefore in a position to create theauthentic local atmosphere contained therein, but there is no record of WilliamShakspere’s ever having traveled outside of England.The magnificent library amassed by Sir Francis Bacon contained the very volumesnecessary to supply the quotations and anecdotes incorporated into theShakespearian plays. Many of the plays, in fact, were taken from plots inearlier writings of which there was no English translation at that time. Becauseof his scholastic acquirements, Lord Verulam could have read the original books;it is most unlikely that William Shakspere could have done so.Abundant cryptographic proof exists that Bacon was concerned in the productionof the Shakespearian plays. Sir Francis Bacon’s cipher number was 33. In theFirst Part of King Henry the Fourth, the word “Francis” appears 33 times uponone page. To attain this end, obviously awkward sentences were required, as:“Anon Francis? No Francis, but tomorrow Francis: or Francis, on Thursday: orindeed Francis when thou wilt. But Francis.”226 [images/00227.jpg] FRANCIS BACON, BARON VERULAM, VISCOUNT ST. ALBANS.Lord Bacon was born in 1561 and history records his death in 1626. There arerecords in existence, however, which would indicate the probability that hisfuneral was a mock funeral and that, leaving England, he lived for many yearsunder another name in Germany, there faithfully serving the secret society tothe promulgation of whose doctrines he had consecrated his life. Little doubtseems to exist in the minds of impartial investigators that Lord Bacon was thelegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Leicester.227 [images/00228.jpg] THE DROESHOUT PORTRAIT OF SHAKSPERE.There are no authentic portraits of Shakspere in existence. The dissimilaritiesin the Droeshout, Chandos, Janssen, Hunt, Ashboume, Soest, and Dunford portraitsprove conclusively that the artists were unaware of Shakspere’s actual features.An examination of the Droeshout portrait discloses several peculiarities.Baconian enthusiasts are convinced that the face is only a caricature, possiblythe death mask of Francis Bacon. A comparison of the Droeshout Shakspere withportraits and engravings of Francis Bacon demonstrates the identity of thestructure of the two faces, the difference in expression being caused by linesof shading. Note also the peculiar line running from the ear down to the chin.Does this line subtly signify that the face itself is a mask, ending at the ear?Notice also that the head is not connected with the body, but is resting on thecollar. Most strange of all is the coat: one-half is on backwards. In drawingthe jacket, the artist has made the left arm correctly, but the right arm hasthe back of the shoulder to the front. Frank Woodward has noted that there are157 letters on the title page. This is a Rosicrucian signature of firstimportance. The date, 1623, plus the two letters “ON” from the word “LONDON,”gives the cryptic signature of Francis Bacon, by a simple numerical cipher. Bymerely exchanging the 26 letters of the alphabet for numbers, 1 becomes A, 6becomes F, 2 becomes B, and 3 becomes C, giving AFBC. To this is added the ONfrom LONDON, resulting in AFBCON, which rearranged forms F. BACON. Throughout the Shakespearian Folios and Quartos occur scores of acrosticsignatures. The simplest form of the acrostic is that whereby a name—in theseinstances Bacon’s—was hidden in the first few letters of lines. In The Tempest,Act I, Scene 2, appears a striking example of the Baconian acrostic:> “Begun to tell me what I am, but stopt> And left me to a bootelesse Inquisition,> Concluding, stay: not yet.” The first letters of the first and second lines together with the first threeletters of the third line form the word BACon. Similar acrostics appearfrequently in Bacon’s acknowledged writings.The tenor of the Shakespearian dramas politically is in harmony with therecognized viewpoints of Sir Francis Bacon, whose enemies are frequentlycaricatured in the plays. Likewise their religious, philosophic, and educationalundercurrents all reflect his personal opinions. Not only do these markedsimilarities of style and terminology exist in Bacon’s writings and theShakespearian plays, but there are also certain historical and philosophicalinaccuracies common to both, such as identical misquotations from Aristotle.Evidently realizing that futurity would unveil his full genius, Lord Verulam inhis will bequeathed his soul to God above by the oblations of his Savior, hisbody to be buried obscurely, his name and memory to men’s charitable speeches,to foreign nations, to succeeding ages, and to his own countrymen after sometime had elapsed. That portion appearing in italics Bacon deleted from his will,apparently fearing that he had said too much.That Sir Francis Bacon’s subterfuge was known to a limited few during hislifetime is quite evident. Accordingly, stray hints regarding the true author ofthe Shakespearian plays may be found in many seventeenth century volumes. Onpage 33 (Bacon’s cipher number) of the 1609 edition of Robert Cawdry’s Treasureor Storehouse of Similes appears the following significant allusion: “Like asmen would laugh at a poore man, if having precious garments lent him to act andplay the part of some honourable personage upon a stage, when the play were atan ende he should keepe them as his owne, and bragge up and downe in them.”Repeated references to the word hog and the presence of cryptographic statementson page 33 of various contemporary writings demonstrate that the keys to Bacon’sciphers were his own name, words playing upon it, or its numerical equivalent.Notable examples are the famous statement of Mistress Quickly in The Merry Wivesof Windsor: “Hang-hog is latten for Bacon, I warrant you”; the title pages ofThe Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia and Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene; and theemblems appearing in the works of Alciatus and Wither. Furthermore, the wordhonorificabilitudinitatibus appearing in the fifth act of Love’s Labour’s Lostis a Rosicrucian signature, as its numerical equivalent (287) indicates.Again, on the title page of the first edition of Sir Francis Bacon’s NewAtlantis, Father Time is depicted bringing a female figure out of the darknessof a cave. Around the device is a Latin inscription: “In time the secret truthshall be revealed.” The catchwords and printer’s devices appearing in volumespublished especially during the first half of the seventeenth century weredesigned, arranged, and in some cases mutilated according to a definite plan.It is evident also that the mispaginations in the Shakespearian Folios and othervolumes are keys to Baconian ciphers, for re-editions—often from new type and bydifferent printers—contain the same mistakes. For example, the First and SecondFolios of Shakespeare are printed from entirely different type and by differentprinters nine years apart, but in both editions page 153 of the Comedies isnumbered 151, and pages 249 and 250 are numbered 250 and 251 respectively. Alsoin the 1640 edition of Bacon’s The Advancement and Profi- cience of Learning,pages 353 and 354 are numbered 351 and 352 respectively, and in the 1641 editionof Du Bartas’ Divine Weeks pages 346 to 350 inclusive are entirely missing,while page 450 is numbered 442. The frequency with which pages ending in numbers50, 51, 52, 53, and 54 are involved will be noted.The requirements of Lord Verulam’s biliteral cipher are fully met in scores ofvolumes printed between 1590 and 1650 and in some printed at other times. Anexamination of the verses by L. Digges, dedicated to the memory of the deceased“Author Maister W. Shakespeare,” reveals the use of two fonts of type for bothcapital and small letters, the differences being most marked in the capital T‘s,N’s, and A’s. (See the First Folio.) The cipher has been deleted from subsequenteditions.The presence of hidden material in the text is often indicated by needlessinvolvement of words. On the sixteenth unnumbered page of the 1641 edition of DuBartas’ Divine Weeks is a boar surmounting a pyramidal text. The text ismeaningless jargon, evidently inserted for cryptographic reasons and marked withBacon’s signature—die hog. The year following publication of the First Folio ofShakespeare’s plays in 1623, there was printed in “Lunæburg” a remarkable volumeon cryptography, avowedly by Gustavus Selenus. It is considered extremelyprobable that this volume constitutes the cryptographic key to the GreatShakespearian Folio.Peculiar symbolical head- and tailpieces also mark the presence of cryptograms.While such ornaments are found in many early printed books, certain emblems arepeculiar to volumes containing Baconian Rosicrucian ciphers. The light and darkshaded A is an interesting example. Bearing in mind the frequent recurrence inBaconian symbolism of the light and dark shaded A and the hog, the followingstatement by Bacon in his Interpretation of Nature is highly significant: “Ifthe sow with her snout should happen to imprint the letter A upon the ground,wouldst thou therefore imagine that she could write out a whole tragedy as oneletter?”The Rosicrucians and other secret societies of the seventeenth century usedwatermarks as mediums for the conveyance of cryptographic references, and bookspresumably containing Baconian ciphers are usually printed upon paper bearingRosicrucian or Masonic watermarks; often there are several symbols in one book,such as the Rose Cross, urns, bunches of grapes, and others.At hand is a document which may prove a remarkable key to a cipher beginning inThe Tragedy of Cymbeline. So far as known it has never been published and isapplicable only to the 1623 Folio of the Shakespearian plays. The cipher is aline-and-word count involving punctuation, especially the long and shortexclamation points and the straight and slanting interrogation points. This codewas discovered by Henry William Bearse in 1900, and after it has been thoroughlychecked its exact nature will be made public.No reasonable doubt remains that the Masonic Order is the direct outgrowth ofthe secret societies of the Middle Ages, nor can it be denied that Freemasonryis permeated by the symbolism and mysticism of the ancient and mediaeval worlds.Sir Francis Bacon knew the true secret of Masonic origin and there is reason tosuspect that he concealed this knowledge in cipher and cryptogram. Bacon is notto be regarded solely as a man but rather as the focal point between aninvisible institution and a world which was never able to distinguish betweenthe messenger and the message which he promulgated. This secret society, havingrediscovered the lost wisdom of the ages and fearing that the knowledge might belost again, perpetuated it in two ways: (1) by an organization (Freemasonry) tothe initiates of which it revealed its wisdom in the form of symbols; (2) byembodying its arcana in the literature of the day by means of cunninglycontrived ciphers and enigmas.Evidence points to the existence of a group of wise and illustrious Fratres whoassumed the responsibility of publishing and preserving for future generationsthe choicest of the secret books of the ancients, together with certain otherdocuments which they themselves had prepared. That future members of theirfraternity might not only identify these volumes but also immediately note thesignificant passages, words, chapters, or sections therein, they created asymbolic alphabet of hieroglyphic designs. By means of a certain key and order,the discerning few were thus enabled to find that wisdom by which a man is“raised” to an illumined life.The tremendous import of the Baconian mystery is daily becoming more apparent.Sir Francis Bacon was a link in that great chain of minds which has perpetuatedthe secret doctrine of antiquity from its beginning. This secret doctrine isconcealed in his cryptic writings. The search for this divine wisdom is the onlylegitimate motive for the effort to decode his cryptograms.228 [images/00229.jpg] A BACONIAN SIGNATURE.The curious volume from which this figure is taken was published in Paris in1618. The attention of the Baconian student is immediately attracted by the formof the hog in the foreground. Bacon often used this animal as a play upon hisown name, especially because the name Bacon was derived from the word beech andthe nut of this tree was used to fatten hogs. The two pillars in the backgroundhave considerable Masonic interest. The two A’s nearly in the center of thepicture—one light and one shaded—are alone almost conclusive proof of Baconianinfluence. The most convincing evidence, however, is the fact that 17 is thenumerical equivalent of the letters of the Latin form of Bacon’s name (F. Baco)and there are 17 letters in the three words appearing in the illustration. Masonic research might discover much of value if it would turn its attention tocertain volumes published during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries whichbear the stamp and signet of that secret society whose members first establishedmodern Freemasonry but themselves remained as an intangible group controllingand directing the activities of the outer body. The unknown history and lostrituals of Freemasonry may be rediscovered in the symbolism and cryptograms ofthe Middle Ages. Freemasonry is the bright and glorious son of a mysterious andhidden father. It cannot trace its parentage because that origin is obscured bythe veil of the superphysical and the mystical. The Great Folio of 1623 is averitable treasure house of Masonic lore and symbolism, and the time is at handwhen that great work should be accorded the consideration which is its due.Though Christianity shattered the material organization of the pagan Mysteries,it could not destroy the knowledge of supernatural power which the paganspossessed. Therefore it is known that the Mysteries of Greece and Egypt weresecretly perpetuated through the early centuries of the church, and later, bybeing clothed in the symbolism of Christianity, were accepted as elements offaith. Sir Francis Bacon was one of those who had been entrusted with theperpetuation and dissemination of the arcana of the superphysical originally inthe possession of the pagan hierophants, and to attain that end eitherformulated the Fraternity of R.C. or was admitted into an organization alreadyexisting under that name and became one of its principal representatives.229 [images/00230.jpg] A CRYPTIC HEADPIECE.Many documents influenced by Baconian philosophy—or intended to conceal Baconianor Rosicrucian cryptograms—use certain conventional designs at the beginning andend of chapters, which reveal to the initiated the presence of concealedinformation. The above ornamental scroll has long been accepted as proof of thepresence of Baconian influence and is to be found only in a certain number ofrare volumes, all of which contain Baconian cryptograms. These cipher messageswere placed in the books either by Bacon himself or by contemporaneous andsubsequent authors belonging to the same secret society which Bacon served withhis remarkable knowledge of ciphers and enigmas. Variants of this headpieceadorn the Great Shakespearian Folio (1623); Bacon’s Novum Organum (1620); theSt. James Bible (1611); Spenser’s Faerie Queene (1611); and Sir Walter Ralegh’sHistory of the World (1614). (See American Baconiana.) For some reason not apparent to the uninitiated there has been a continued andconsistent effort to prevent the unraveling of the Baconian skein. Whatever thepower may be which continually blocks the efforts of the investigators, it is asunremitting now as it was immediately following Bacon’s death, and thoseattempting to solve the enigma still feel the weight of its resentment.A misunderstanding world has ever persecuted those who understood the secretworkings of Nature, seeking in every conceivable manner to exterminate thecustodians of this divine wisdom. Sir Francis Bacon’s political prestige wasfinally undermined and Sir Walter Ralegh met a shameful fate because theirtranscendental knowledge was considered dangerous.The forging of Shakspere’s handwriting; the foisting of fraudulent portraits anddeath masks upon a gullible public; the fabrication of spurious biographies; themutilation of books and documents; the destruction or rendering illegible oftablets and inscriptions containing cryptographic messages, have all compoundedthe difficulties attendant upon the solution of the Bacon-Shakspere-Rosicrucianriddle. The Ireland forgeries deceived experts for years.According to material available, the supreme council of the Fraternity of R.C.was composed of a certain number of individuals who had died what is known asthe “philosophic death.” When the time came for an initiate to enter upon hislabors for the Order, he conveniently “died” under somewhat mysteriouscircumstances. In reality he changed his name and place of residence, and a boxof rocks or a body secured for the purpose was buried in his stead. It isbelieved that this happened in the case of Sir Francis Bacon who, like allservants of the Mysteries, renounced all personal credit and permitted others tobe considered as the authors of the documents which he wrote or inspired.The cryptic writings of Francis Bacon constitute one of the most powerfultangible elements in the mysteries of transcendentalism and symbolic philosophy.Apparently many years must yet pass before an uncomprehending world willappreciate the transcending genius of that mysterious man who wrote the NovumOrganum, who sailed his little ship far out into the unexplored sea of learningthrough the Pillars of Hercules, and whose ideals for a new civilization aremagnificently expressed in the Utopian dream of The New Atlantis. Was SirFrancis Bacon a second Prometheus? Did his great love for the people of theworld and his pity for their ignorance cause him to bring the divine fire fromheaven concealed within the contents of a printed page?In all probability, the keys to the Baconian riddle will be found in classicalmythology. He who understands the secret of the Seven-Rayed God will comprehendthe method employed by Bacon to accomplish his monumental labor. Aliases wereassumed by him in accordance with the attributes and order of the members of theplanetary system. One of the least known—but most important—keys to the Baconianenigma is the Third, or 1637, Edition, published in Paris, of Les Images ouTableaux de platte peinture des deux Philostrates sophistes grecs et les statuesde Callistrate, by Blaise de Vigenere. The title page of this volume—which, asthe name of the author when properly deciphered indicates, was written by orunder the direction of Bacon or his secret society—is one mass of importantMasonic or Rosicrucian symbols. On page 486 appears a plate entitled “HerculesFurieux,” showing a gigantic figure shaking a spear, the ground before himstrewn with curious emblems. In his curious work, Das Bild des Speershüttlersdie Lösung des Shakespeare-Rätsels, Alfred Freund attempts to explain theBaconian symbolism in the Philostrates. Bacon he reveals as the philosophicalHercules, whom time will establish as the true “Spear-Shaker” (Shakespeare)."},{"pageContent":"XXXIX The Cryptogram as a Factor in Symbolic Philosophy No treatise which deals with symbolism would be complete without a sectiondevoted to the consideration of cryptograms. The use of ciphers has long beenrecognized as indispensable in military and diplomatic circles, but the modernworld has overlooked the important role played by cryptography in literature andphilosophy.If the art of deciphering cryptograms could be made popular, it would result inthe discovery of much hitherto unsuspected wisdom possessed by both ancient andmediaeval philosophers. It would prove that many apparently verbose and ramblingauthors were wordy for the sake of concealing words. Ciphers are hidden in themost subtle manner: they may be concealed in the watermark of the paper uponwhich a book is printed; they may be bound into the covers of ancient books;they may be hidden under imperfect pagination; they may be extracted from thefirst letters of words or the first words of sentences; they may be artfullyconcealed in mathematical equations or in apparently unintelligible characters;they may be extracted from the jargon of clowns or revealed by heat as havingbeen written in sympathetic ink; they may be word ciphers, letter ciphers, orapparently ambiguous statements whose meaning could be understood only byrepeated careful readings; they may be discovered in the elaborately illuminatedinitial letters of early books or they may be revealed by a process of countingwords or letters. If those interested in Freemasonic research would give seriousconsideration to this subject, they might find in books and manuscripts of thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries the information necessary to bridge the gapin Masonic history that now exists between the Mysteries of the ancient worldand the Craft Masonry of the last three centuries.230 [images/00231.jpg] A FAMOUS CRYPTIC TITLE PAGE.One year after the publication of the first Great “Shakespearian” Folio, aremarkable volume on cryptograms and ciphers was published. The title page ofthe work is reproduced above. The year of its publication (1624) was during theRosicrucian controversy. The translation of the title page is as follows: “TheCryptomenysis and Cryptography of Gustavus Selenus in nine books, to which isadded a clear explanation of the System of Steganography of John Trithemius,Abbot of Spanheim and Herbipolis, a man of admirable genius. Interspersed withworthy inventions of the Author and others, 1624.”The author of this volume was believed to be Augustus, Duke of Brunswick. Thesymbols and emblems ornamenting the title page, however, are conclusive evidencethat the fine hand of the Rosicrucians was behind its publication. At the bottomof the picture is a nobleman (Bacon?) placing his hat on another man’s head. Inthe oval at the top of the plate, it is possible that the lights are beacons, ora play upon the name Bacon. In the two side panels are striking and subtle“Shakespearian” allusions. On the left is a nobleman (possibly Bacon) handing apaper to another man of mean appearance who carries in his hand a spear. At theright, the man who previously carried the spear is shown in the costume of anactor, wearing spurs and blowing a horn. The allusion to the actor blowing hishorn and the figure carrying the spear suggest much, especially as spear is thelast syllable of the name “Shakespeare.”231 [images/00232.jpg] AN EXAMPLE OF BILITERAL WRITING.In the above sentence note carefully the formation of the letters. Compare eachletter with the two types of letters in the biliteral alphabet table reproducedfrom Lord Bacon’s De Augmentis Scientiarum. A comparison of the “d” in “wisdom”with the “d” in “and” discloses a large loop at the top of the first, while thesecond shows practically no loop at all. Contrast the “i” in “wisdom” with the“i” in “understanding.” In the former the lines are curved and in the latterangular. A similar analysis of the two “e’s” in “desired” reveals obviousdifferences. The “o” in “more” differs only from the “o” in “wisdom” in that atiny line continues from the top over towards the “r.” The “a” in “than” isthinner and more angular than the “a” in “are,” while the “r” in “riches”differs from that in “desired” in that the final upright stroke terminates in aball instead of a sharp point. These minor differences disclose the presence ofthe two alphabets employed in writing the sentence. The arcana of the ancient Mysteries were never revealed to the profane exceptthrough the media of symbols. Symbolism fulfilled the dual office of concealingthe sacred truths from the uninitiated and revealing them to those qualified tounderstand the symbols. Forms are the symbols of formless divine principles;symbolism is the language of Nature. With reverence the wise pierce the veil andwith clearer vision contemplate the reality; but the ignorant, unable todistinguish between the false and the true, behold a universe of symbols. It maywell be said of Nature—the Great Mother—that she is ever tracing strangecharacters upon the surface of things, but only to her eldest and wisest sons asa reward for their faith and devotion does she reveal the cryptic alphabet whichis the key to the import of these tracings.The temples of the ancient Mysteries evolved their own sacred languages, knownonly to their initiates and never spoken save in the sanctuary. The illuminedpriests considered it sacrilege to discuss the sacred truths of the higherworlds or the divine verities of eternal Nature in the same tongue as that usedby the vulgar for wrangling and dissension. A sacred science must needs becouched in a sacred language. Secret alphabets also were invented, and wheneverthe secrets of the wise were committed to writing, characters meaningless to theuninformed were employed. Such forms of writing were called sacred or Hermeticalphabets. Some—such as the famous angelic writing—are still retained in thehigher degrees of Masonry.Secret alphabets were not entirely satisfactory, however, for although theyrendered unintelligible the true nature of the writings, their very presencedisclosed the fact of concealed information—which the priests also sought toconceal. Through patience or persecution, the keys to these alphabets wereeventually acquired and the contents of the documents revealed to the unworthy.This necessitated employment of more subtle methods for concealing the divinetruths. The result was the appearance of cryptic systems of writing designed toconceal the presence of both the message and the cryptogram. Having thus deviseda method of transmitting their secrets to posterity, the illuminati encouragedthe circulation of certain documents specially prepared through incorporatinginto them ciphers containing the deepest secrets of mysticism and philosophy.Thus mediaeval philosophers disseminated their theories throughout Europewithout evoking suspicion, since volumes containing these cryptograms could besubjected to the closest scrutiny without revealing the presence of the hiddenmessage.During the Middle Ages scores of writers—members of secret political orreligious organizations—published books containing ciphers. Secret writingbecame a fad; every European court had its own diplomatic cipher, and theintelligentsia vied with one another in devising curious and complicatedcryptograms. The literature of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenthcenturies is permeated with ciphers, few of which have ever been decoded. Manyof the magnificent scientific and philosophic intellects of this period darednot publish their findings, because of the religious intolerance of their day.In order to preserve the fruitage of their intellectual labors for mankind,these pioneers of progress concealed their discoveries in ciphers, trusting thatfuture generations, more kindly than their own, would discover and appreciatetheir learning.232 [images/00233.jpg] THE BILITERAL ALPHABET.This plate is reproduced from Bacon’s De Augmentis Scientiarum, and shows thetwo alphabets as designed by him for the purpose of his cipher. Each capital andsmall letter has two distinct forms which are designated “a” and “b.” Thebiliteral system did not in every instance make use of two alphabets in whichthe differences were as perceptible as in the example here given, but twoalphabets were always used; sometimes the variations are so minute that itrequires a powerful magnifying glass to distinguish the difference between the“a” and the “b” types of letters. Many churchmen, it is interesting to note, used cryptograms, fearingexcommunication or a worse fate should their scientific researches be suspected.Only recently an intricate cipher of Roger Bacon’s has been unraveled, revealingthe fact that this early scientist was well versed in the cellular theory.Lecturing before the American Philosophical Society, Dr. William RomaineNewbold, who translated the cipher manuscript of the friar, declared: “There aredrawings which so accurately portray the actual appearance of certain objectsthat it is difficult to resist the inference that Bacon had seen them with themicroscope. * * * These are spermatozoa, the body cells and the seminiferoustubes, the ova, with their nuclei distinctly indicated. There are nine largedrawings, of which one at least bears considerable resemblance to a certainstage of development of fertilized cell.” (See Review of Reviews, July, 1921.)Had Roger Bacon failed to conceal this discovery under a complicated cipher, hewould have been persecuted as a heretic and would probably have met the fate ofother early liberal thinkers. In spite of the rapid progress made by science inthe last two hundred and fifty years, it still remains ignorant concerning manyof the original discoveries made by mediaeval investigators. The only record ofthese important findings is that contained in the cryptograms of the volumeswhich they published.233 [images/00234.jpg] THE KEY TO THE BILITERAL CIPHER.After the document to be deciphered has been reduced to its “a” and “b”equivalents, it is then broken up into five-letter groups and the message readwith the aid of the above table. While many authors have written on the subject of cryptography, the books mostvaluable to students of philosophy and religion are: Polygraphia and Stega-nographia, by Trithemius, Abbot of Spanheim; Mercury, or The Secret and SwiftMessenger, by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester; Œdipus Ægyptiacus and other worksby Athanasius Kircher, Society of Jesus; and Cryptomenytices et Crypto- graphiœ,by Gustavus Selenus.To illustrate the basic differences in their construction and use, the variousforms of ciphers are here grouped under seven general headings:1. The literal cipher. The most famous of all literal cryptograms is the famousbiliteral cipher described by Sir Francis Bacon in his De Augmentis Scientiarum.Lord Bacon originated the system while still a young man residing in Paris. Thebiliteral cipher requires the use of two styles of type, one an ordinary faceand the other specially cut. The differences between the two fonts are in manycases so minute that it requires a powerful magnifying glass to detect them.Originally, the cipher messages were concealed only in the italicized words,sentences, or paragraphs, because the italic letters, being more ornate than theRoman letters, offered greater opportunity for concealing the slight butnecessary variations. Sometimes the letters vary a trifle in size; at othertimes in thickness or in their ornamental flourishes. Later, Lord Bacon isbelieved to have had two Roman alphabets specially prepared in which thedifferences were so trivial that it is almost impossible for experts todistinguish them.A careful inspection of the first four “Shakespeare” folios discloses the usethroughout the volumes of several styles of type differing in minute butdistinguishable details. It is possible that all the “Shakespeare” folioscontain ciphers running through the text. These ciphers may have been added tothe original plays, which are much longer in the folios than in the originalquartos, full scenes having been added in some instances.The biliteral cipher was not confined to the writings of Bacon and “Shake-speare,” however, but appears in many books published during Lord Bacon’slifetime and for nearly a century after his death. In referring to the biliteralcipher, Lord Bacon terms it omnia per omnia. The cipher may run through anentire book and be placed therein at the time of printing without the knowledgeof the original author, for it does not necessitate the changing of either wordsor punctuation. It is possible that this cipher was inserted for politicalpurposes into many documents and volumes published during the seventeenthcentury. It is well known that ciphers were used for the same reason as early asthe Council of Nicæa.The Baconian biliteral cipher is difficult to use today, owing to the presentexact standardization of type and the fact that so few books are now hand set.Accompanying this chapter are facsimiles of Lord Bacon’s biliteral alphabet asit appeared in the 1640 English translation of De Augmentis Scientiarum. Thereare four alphabets, two for the capital and two for the small letters. Considercarefully the differences between these four and note that each alphabet has thepower of either the letter a or the letter b, and that when reading a word itsletters are divisible into one of two groups: those which correspond to theletter a and those which correspond to the letter b. In order to employ thebiliteral cipher, a document must contain five times as many letters as thereare in the cipher message to be concealed, for it requires five letters toconceal one. The biliteral cipher somewhat resembles a telegraph code in whichletters are changed into dots and dashes; according to the biliteral system,however, the dots and dashes are represented respectively by a’s and b’s. Theword biliteral is derived from the fact that all letters of the alphabet may bereduced to either a or b. An example of biliteral writing is shown in one of theaccompanying diagrams. In order to demonstrate the working of this cipher, themessage concealed within the words “Wisdom and understanding are more to bedesired than riches” will now be deciphered.234 [images/00235.jpg] A MODERN WHEEL, OR DISC, CIPHER.The above diagram shows a wheel cipher. The smaller, or inner, alphabet movesaround so that any one of its letters may be brought opposite any one of theletters on the larger, or outer, alphabet. In some cases the inner alphabet iswritten backwards, but in the present example, both alphabets read the same way. The first step is to discover the letters of each alphabet and replace them bytheir equivalent a or b in accordance with the key given by Lord Bacon in hisbiliteral alphabet (q. v.). In the word wisdom, the W is from the b alphabet;therefore it is replaced by a b. The i is from the a alphabet; therefore an a isput in its place. The s is also from the a alphabet, but the d belongs to the balphabet. The o and the m both belong to the a alphabet; hence each is replacedby a. By this process the word WISDOM therefore becomes baabaa. Treating theremaining words of the sentence in a similar manner, AND becomes aba;UNDERSTANDING, aaabaaaaaabab; ARE, aba; MORE, abbb; TO, ab; BE, ab; DESIRED,abaabaa; THAN, aaba; RICHES, aaaaaa.The next step is to run all the letters together; thus: baabaaabaaaabaaaaaaabababaabbbabababaabaaaabaaaaaaa. All the combinations used in theBaconian biliteral cipher consist of groups containing five letters each.Therefore the solid line of letters must be broken into groups of five in thefollowing manner: baaba aabaa aabaa aaaab ababa abbba babab aabaa aabaa aaaaa.Each of these groups of five letters now represents one letter of the cipher,and the actual letter can now be determined by comparing the groups with thealphabetical table, The Key to the Biliteral Cipher, from De AugmentisScientiarum (q.v.); baaba = T; aabaa = E; aabaa = E; aaaab = B; ababa = L; abbba= P; babab = X; aabaa = E; aabaa = E; aaaaa = A; but the last five letters ofthe word riches being set off by a period from the initial r, the last five a’sdo not count in the cipher. The letters thus extracted are now brought togetherin order, resulting in TEEBLPXEE.At this point the inquirer might reasonably expect the letters to makeintelligible words; but he will very likely be disappointed, for, as in the caseabove, the letters thus extracted are themselves a cryptogram, doubly involvedto discourage those who might have a casual acquaintance with the biliteralsystem. The next step is to apply the nine letters to what is commonly called awheel (or disc) cipher (q.v.), which consists of two alphabets, one revolvingaround the other in such a manner that numerous transpositions of letters arepossible. In the accompanying cut the A of the inner alphabet is opposite the Hof the outer alphabet, so that for cipher purposes these letters areinterchangeable. The F and M, the R and Υ, the W and D, in fact all the letters,may be transposed as shown by the two circles. The nine letters extracted by thebiliteral cipher may thus be exchanged for nine others by the wheel cipher. Thenine letters are considered as being on the inner circle of the wheel and areexchanged for the nine letters on the outer circle which are opposite the innerletters. By this process the T becomes A; the two E’s become two L’s; the Bbecomes I; the L becomes S; the P becomes W; the X becomes E; and the two E’sbecome two L’s. The result is ALLISWELL, which, broken up into words, reads:“All is well.”Of course, by moving the inner disc of the wheel cipher, many differentcombinations in addition to the one given above can be made of the letters, butthis is the only one which will produce sense, and the cryptogrammatist mustkeep on experimenting until he discovers a logical and intelligible message. Hemay then feel reasonably sure that he has deciphered the system. Lord Baconinvolved the biliteral cipher in many different ways. There are probably a scoreof different systems used in the “Shakespeare” folio alone, some so intricatethat they may forever baffle all attempts at their decipherment. In thosesusceptible of solution, sometimes the a’s and b’s have to be exchanged; atother times the concealed message is written backwards; again only every otherletter is counted; and so on.There are several other forms of the literal cipher in which letters aresubstituted for each other by a prearranged sequence. The simplest form is thatin which two alphabets are written thus:235 [images/00236.jpg] By substituting the letters of the lower alphabet for their equivalents in theupper one, a meaningless conglomeration results, the hidden message beingdecoded by reversing the process. There is also a form of the literal cipher inwhich the actual cryptogram is written in the body of the document, butunimportant words are inserted between important ones according to a prearrangedorder. The literal cipher also includes what are called acrostic signatures—thatis, words written down the column by the use of the first letter of eachline—and also more complicated acrostics in which the important letters arescattered through entire paragraphs or chapters. The two accompanying alchemicalcryptograms illustrate another form of the literal cipher involving the firstletter of each word. Every cryptogram based upon the arrangement or combinationof the letters of the alphabet is called a literal cipher.2. The pictorial cipher. Any picture or drawing with other than its obviousmeaning may be considered a pictorial cryptogram. Instances of pictorial cipherare frequently found in Egyptian symbolism and early religious art. The diagramsof alchemists and Hermetic philosophers are invariably pictorial ciphers. Inaddition to the simple pictorial cipher, there is a more technical form in whichwords or letters are concealed by the number of stones in a wall, by the spreadof birds’ wings in flight, by ripples on the surface of water, or by the lengthand order of lines used in shading. Such cryptograms are not obvious, and mustbe decoded with the aid of an arbitrary measuring scale, the length of the linesdetermining the letter or word concealed. The shape and proportion of abuilding, the height of a tower, the number of bars in a window, the folds of aman’s garments—even the proportions or attitude of the human body—were used toconceal definite figures or characters which could be exchanged for letters orwords by a person acquainted with the code.236 [images/00237.jpg] AN ALCHEMICAL CRYPTOGRAM.James Campbell Brown reprints a curious cipher from Kircher. The capital lettersof the seven words in the outer circle, when read clockwise, form the wordSVLPHVR. From the five words in the second circle, when read in a similarmanner, is derived FIXVM. The capitals of the six words in the inner circle,when properly arranged, also read EST SOL. The following cipher is thusextracted: “Sulphur Fixum Est Sol.” which when translated is: “Fixed sulphur isgold.” Initial letters of names were secreted in architectural arches and spans. Anotable example of this practice is found on the title page of Montaigne’sEssays, third edition, where an initial B is formed by two arches and an F by abroken arch. Pictorial cryptograms are sometimes accompanied by the keynecessary for their decipherment. A figure may point toward the starting pointof the cipher or carry in its hand some implement disclosing the system ofmeasurement used. There are also frequent instances in which the cryptographerpurposely distorted or improperly clothed some figure in his drawing by placingthe hat on backwards, the sword on the wrong side, or the shield on the wrongarm, or by employing some similar artifice. The much-discussed fifth finger onthe Pope’s hand in Raphael’s Sistine Madonna and the sixth toe on Joseph’s footin the same artist’s Marriage of the Virgin are cunningly concealed cryptograms.3. The acroamatic cipher. The religious and philosophical writings of allnations abound with acroamatic cryptograms, that is, parables and allegories.The acroamatic is unique in that the document containing it may be translated orreprinted without affecting the cryptogram. Parables and allegories have beenused since remote antiquity to present moral truths in an attractive andunderstandable manner. The acroamatic cryptogram is a pictorial cipher drawn inwords and its symbolism must be so interpreted. The Old and New Testaments ofthe Jews, the writings of Plato and Aristotle, Homer’s Odyssey and Iliad,Virgil’s Æneid, The Metamorphosis of Apuleius, and Æsop’s Fables are outstandingexamples of acroamatic cryptography in which are concealed the deepest and mostsublime truths of ancient mystical philosophy.The acroamatic cipher is the most subtle of all, for the parable or allegory issusceptible of several interpretations. Bible students for centuries have beenconfronted by this difficulty They are satisfied with the moral interpretationof the parable and forget that each parable and allegory is capable of seveninterpretations, of which the seventh—the highest—is complete and all-inclusive,whereas the other six (and lesser) interpretations are fragmentary, revealingbut part of the mystery. The creation myths of the world are acroamaticcryptograms, and the deities of the various pantheons are only crypticcharacters which, if properly understood, become the constituents of a divinealphabet. The initiated few comprehend the true nature of this alphabet, but theuninitiated many worship the letters of it as gods.4. The numerical cipher. Many cryptograms have been produced in which numbers invarious sequences are substituted for letters, words, or even complete thoughts.The reading of numerical ciphers usually depends upon the possession ofspecially arranged tables of correspondences. The numerical cryptograms of theOld Testament are so complicated that only a few scholars versed in rabbinicallore have ever sought to unravel their mysteries. In his Œdi- pus Ægyptiacus,Athanasius Kircher describes several Arabian Qabbalistic theorems, and a greatpart of the Pythagorean mystery was concealed in a secret method in vogue amongGreek mystics of substituting letters for numbers.The most simple numerical cipher is that in which the letters of the alphabetare exchanged for numbers in ordinary sequence. Thus A becomes 1, B 2, C3, andso on, counting both I and J as 9 and both U and V as 20. The word yes by thissystem would be written 23-5-18. This cipher can be made more difficult byreversing the alphabet so that Z becomes 1, Υ2, X3, and so on. By inserting anon-significant, or uncounted, number after each of the significant numbers thecipher is still more effectively concealed, thus: 23-16-5-9-18. The word yes isfound by eliminating the second and fourth numbers. By adding 23, 5, and 18together the sum 46 results. Therefore 46 is the numerical equivalent of theword yes. According to the simple numerical cipher, the sum 138 is equal to thewords Note carefully. Therefore in a book using this method, line 138, page 138,or paragraph 138 may contain the concealed message. In addition to this simplenumerical cipher there are scores of others so complicated that no one withoutthe key can hope to solve them.Authors sometimes based their cryptograms upon the numerical value of their ownnames; for example, Sir Francis Bacon repeatedly used the cryptic number 33—thenumerical equivalent of his name. Numerical ciphers often involve the paginationof a book. Imperfect pagination, though generally attributed to carelessness,often conceals important secrets. The mispaginations found in the 1623 folio of“Shakspeare” and the consistent recurrence of similar errors in various volumesprinted about the same period have occasioned considerable thought amongscholars and cryptogrammatists. In Baconian cryptograms, all page numbers endingin 89 seem to have a special significance. The 89th page of the Comedies in the1623 folio of “Shakespeare” shows an error of type in the pagination, the “9”being from a considerably smaller font than the “8.” The 189th page is entirelymissing, there being two pages numbered 187; and page 188 shows the second ”8”scarcely more than half the size of the first one. Page 289 is correctlynumbered and has no unusual features, but page 89 of the Histories is missing.Several volumes published by Bacon show similar errors, page 89 being ofteninvolved.There are also numerical ciphers from which the cryptic message may be extractedby counting every tenth word, every twentieth word, or every fiftieth word. Insome cases the count is irregular. The first important word may be found bycounting 100, the second by counting 90, the third by counting 80, and so onuntil the count of 10 is reached. The count then returns to 100 and the processis repeated.5. The musical cipher. John Wilkins, afterwards Bishop of Chester, in 1641circulated an anonymous essay entitled Mercury, or the Secret and SwiftMessenger. In this little volume, which was largely derived from the morevoluminous treatises of Trithemius and Selenus, the author sets forth a methodwhereby musicians can converse with each other by substituting musical notes forthe letters of the alphabet. Two persons understanding the code could conversewith each other by merely playing certain notes upon a piano or otherinstrument. Musical cryptograms can be involved to an inconceivable point; bycertain systems it is possible to take an already existing musical theme andconceal in it a cryptogram without actually changing the composition in any way.The pennants upon the notes may conceal the cipher, or the actual sounds of thenotes may be exchanged for syllables of similar sound. This latter method iseffective but its scope is somewhat limited. Several musical compositions by SirFrancis Bacon are still in existence. An examination of them might revealmusical cryptograms, for it is quite certain that Lord Bacon was well acquaintedwith the manner of their construction.6. The arbitrary cipher. The system of exchanging letters of the alphabet forhieroglyphic figures is too easily decoded to be popular. Albert Pike describesan arbitrary cipher based upon the various parts of the Knights Templars’ cross,each angle representing a letter. The many curious alphabets that have beendevised are rendered worthless, however, by the table of recurrence. Accordingto Edgar Allan Poe, a great cryptogrammatist, the most common letter of theEnglish language is E; the other letters in their order of frequency are asfollows: A, O, I, D, H, N, R, S, T, U, Y, C, F, G, L, M, W, B, K, P, Q X, Z.Other authorities declare the table of frequency to be: E, T, A, O, N, I, R, S,H, D, L, C, W, U, M, F, Y, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q J, Z. By merely counting thenumber of times each character appears in the message, the law of recurrencediscloses the English letter for which the arbitrary character stands. Furtherhelp is also rendered by the fact that if the cryptogram be split up into wordsthere are only three single letters which may form words: A, I, O. Thus anysingle character set off from the rest of the text must be one of these threeletters. For details of this system see The Gold Bug, by Edgar Allan Poe.237 [images/00238.jpg] AN ALCHEMICAL CRYPTOGRAM.Beginning with the word VISITA and reading clockwise, the seven initial lettersof the seven words inscribed in the outer circle read: VITRIOL. This is a verysimple alchemical enigma, but is a reminder that those studying works onHermeticism, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, and Freemasonry should always be on thelookout for concealed meanings hidden either in parables and allegories or incryptic arrangements of numbers, Letters, and words. To render more difficult the decoding of arbitrary ciphers, however, thecharacters are seldom broken up into words, and, further, the table ofrecurrence is partly nullified by assigning two or more different characters toeach letter, thereby making it impossible to estimate accurately the frequencyof recurrence. Therefore, the greater the number of arbitrary characters used torepresent any single letter of the alphabet, the more difficult it is todecipher an arbitrary cryptogram. The secret alphabets of the ancients arecomparatively easy to decode, the only requisites being a table of frequency, aknowledge of the language in which the cryptogram was originally written, amoderate amount of patience, and a little ingenuity.7. The code cipher. The most modern form of cryptogram is the code system. Itsmost familiar form is the Morse code for use in telegraphic and wirelesscommunication. This form of cipher may be complicated somewhat by embodying dotsand dashes into a document in which periods and colons are dots, while commasand semicolons are dashes. There are also codes used by the business world whichcan be solved only by the use of a private code book. Because they furnish aneconomical and efficient method of transmitting confidential information, theuse of such codes is far more prevalent than the average person has anysuspicion.238 [images/00239.jpg] QABBALISTIC AND MAGIC ALPHABETS.Curious alphabets were invented by the early and medieval philosophers toconceal their doctrines and tenets from the profane. Some of these alphabets arestill used to a limited extent in the higher degrees of Freemasonry. Probablythe most famous is the angelic writing, termed in the above plate “The Writingcalled Malachim.” Its figures are supposedly derived from the constellations.Advanced students of occult philosophy will come upon many valuable documents inwhich these figures are used. Under each letter of the first alphabet above isits equivalent in English.Above each letter of the other three alphabets is its Hebrew letter equivalent.In addition to the foregoing classifications there are a number of miscellaneoussystems of secret writing, some employing mechanical devices, others colors. Afew make use of sundry miscellaneous objects to represent words and evencomplete thoughts. But as these more elaborate devices were seldom employed bythe ancients or by the mediaeval philosophers and alchemists, they have nodirect bearing upon religion and philosophy. The mystics of the Middle Ages,borrowing the terminology of the various arts and sciences, evolved a system ofcryptography which concealed the secrets of the human soul under terms generallyapplied to chemistry, biology, astronomy, botany, and physiology. Ciphers ofthis nature can only be decoded by individuals versed in the deep philosophicprinciples upon which these mediaeval mystics based their theories of life. Muchinformation relating to the invisible nature of man is concealed under what seemto be chemical experiments or scientific speculations. Every student ofsymbolism and philosophy, therefore, should be reasonably well acquainted withthe underlying principles of cryptography; in addition to serving him well inhis researches, this art furnishes a fascinating method of developing theacuteness of the mental faculties. Discrimination and observation areindispensable to the seeker after knowledge, and no study is equal tocryptography as a means of stimulating these powers."},{"pageContent":"XL Freemasonic Symbolism In several early Masonic manuscripts—for example, the Harleian, Sloane,Lansdowne, and Edinburgh-Kilwinning—it is stated that the craft of initiatedbuilders existed before the Deluge, and that its members were employed in thebuilding of the Tower of Babel. A Masonic Constitution dated 1701 gives thefollowing naive account of the origin of the sciences, arts, and crafts fromwhich the major part of Masonic symbolism is derived:“How this worthy Science was first begunne, I shall tell. Before Noah’s Flood,there was a man called Lameck as it is written in the 4 Chap. of Gen.: and thisLameck had two Wives. The one was called Adah, and the other Zillah; by thefirst wife Adah he gott two Sons, the one called Jaball, and the other Juball,and by the other wife Zillah he got a Son and Daughter, and the four childrenfound the beginning of all Crafts in the world. This Jaball was the elder Son,and he found the Craft of Geometrie, and he parted flocks, as of Sheep and Lambsin the fields, and first wrought Houses of Stone and Tree, as it is noted in theChap’ aforesaid, and his Brother Juball found the crafte of Musick, of Songs,Organs and Harp. The Third Brother [Tubal-cain] found out Smith’s craft to workIron and steel, and their sister Naamah found out the art of Weaving. Thesechildren did know thatt God would take Vengeance for Sinne, either by fire orwater, wherefor they wrote these Sciences which they had found in Two Pillars ofstone, thatt they might be found after the Flood. The one stone was calledMarbell—cannott burn with Fire, and the other was called Laturus [brass?], thattcannott drown in the Water.” The author of this Constitution thereupon declaresthat one of these pillars was later discovered by Hermes, who communicated tomankind the secrets thereon inscribed.In his Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus writes that Adam had forewarned hisdescendants that sinful humanity would be destroyed by a deluge. In order topreserve their science and philosophy, the children of Seth therefore raised twopillars, one of brick and the other of stone, on which were inscribed the keysto their knowledge. The Patriarch Enoch—whose name means the Initiator—isevidently a personification of the sun, since he lived 365 years. He alsoconstructed an underground temple consisting of nine vaults, one beneath theother, placing in the deepest vault a triangular tablet of gold bearing upon itthe absolute and ineffable Name of Deity. According to some accounts, Enoch madetwo golden deltas. The larger he placed upon the white cubical altar in thelowest vault and the smaller he gave into the keeping of his son, Methusaleh,who did the actual construction work of the brick chambers according to thepattern revealed to his father by the Most High. In the form and arrangement ofthese vaults Enoch epitomized the nine spheres of the ancient Mysteries and thenine sacred strata of the earth through which the initiate must pass to reachthe flaming Spirit dwelling in its central core.According to Freemasonic symbolism, Enoch, fearing that all knowledge of thesacred Mysteries would be lost at the time of the Deluge, erected the twocolumns mentioned in the quotation. Upon the metal column in appropriateallegorical symbols he engraved the secret teaching and upon the marble columnplaced an inscription stating that a short distance away a priceless treasurewould be discovered in a subterranean vault. After having thus faithfullycompleted his labors, Enoch was translated from the brow of Mount Moriah. Intime the location of the secret vaults was lost, but after the lapse of agesthere came another builder—an initiate after the order of Enoch—and he, whilelaying the foundations for another temple to the Great Architect of theUniverse, discovered the long-lost vaults and the secrets contained within.John Leylande was appointed by King Henry VIII to go through the archives of thevarious religious institutions dissolved by the king and remove for preservationany books or manuscripts of an important character. Among the documents copiedby Leylande was a series of questions and answers concerning the mystery ofMasonry written by King Henry VI. In answer to the question, “How came Masonryinto England?” the document states that Peter Gower, a Grecian, traveled forknowledge in Egypt, Syria, and every land where the Phoenicians had plantedMasonry; winning entrance in all lodges of Masons, he learned much, andreturning, dwelt in Greater Greece. He became renowned for his wisdom, formed agreat lodge at Groton, and made many Masons, some of whom journeyed in France,spreading Masonry there; from France in the course of time the order passed intoEngland.To even the superficial student of the subject it must be evident that the nameof Peter Gower, the Grecian, is merely an Anglicized form of Pythagoras;consequently Groton, where he formed his lodge, is easily identified withCrotona. A link is thus established between the philosophic Mysteries of Greeceand mediaeval Freemasonry. In his notes on King Henry’s questions and answers,William Preston enlarges upon the vow of secrecy as it was practiced by theancient initiates. On the authority of Pliny he describes how Anaxarchus, havingbeen imprisoned in order to extort from him some of the secrets with which hehad been entrusted, bit out his own tongue and threw it in the face ofNicocreon, the tyrant of Cyprus. Preston adds that the Athenians revered abrazen statue that was represented without a tongue to denote the sanctity withwhich they regarded their oath-bound secrets. It is also noteworthy that,according to King Henry’s manuscript, Masonry had its origin in the East and wasthe carrier of the arts and sciences of civilization to the primitive humanityof the western nations.Conspicuous among the symbols of Freemasonry are the seven liberal arts andsciences. By grammar man is taught to express in noble and adequate language hisinnermost thoughts and ideals; by rhetoric he is enabled to conceal his idealsunder the protecting cover of ambiguous language and figures of speech; by logiche is trained in the organization of the intellectual faculties with which hehas been endowed; by arithmetic he not only is instructed in the mystery ofuniversal order but also gains the key to multitude, magnitude, and proportion;by geometry he is inducted into the mathematics of form, the harmony and rhythmof angles, and the philosophy of organization; by music he is reminded that theuniverse is founded upon the laws of celestial harmonics and that harmony andrhythm are all-pervading; by astronomy he gains an understanding of theimmensities of time and space, of the proper relationship between himself andthe universe, and of the awesomeness of that Unknown Power which is driving thecountless stars of the firmament through illimitable space. Equipped with theknowledge conferred by familiarity with the liberal arts and sciences, thestudious Freemason therefore finds himself confronted by few problems with whichhe cannot cope."},{"pageContent":"THE DIONYSIAC ARCHITECTS The most celebrated of the ancient fraternities of artisans was that of theDionysiac Architects. This organization was composed exclusively of initiates ofthe Bacchus-Dionysos cult and was peculiarly consecrated to the science ofbuilding and the art of decoration. Acclaimed as being the custodians of asecret and sacred knowledge of architectonics, its members were entrusted withthe design and erection of public buildings and monuments. The superlativeexcellence of their handiwork elevated the members of the guild to a position ofsurpassing dignity; they were regarded as the master craftsmen of the earth.Because of the first dances held in honor of Dionysos, he was considered thefounder and patron of the theater, and the Dionysians specialized in theconstruction of buildings adapted for the presentation of dramatic performances.In the circular or semicircular orchestra they invariably erected an altar toDionysos, and the rites of the Mysteries usually formed the motif for thetragedies and comedies enacted. It is related of Æschylus, the famous Greekpoet, that while appearing in one of his own plays he was suspected by a mob ofangry spectators of revealing one of the profound secrets of the Mysteries andwas forced to seek refuge at the altar of Dionysos.So carefully did the Dionysiac Architects safeguard the secrets of their craftthat only fragmentary records exist of their esoteric teachings. John A. Weissethus sums up the meager data available concerning the order:“They made their appearance certainly not later than 1000 B.C., and appear tohave enjoyed particular privileges and immunities. They also possessed secretmeans of recognition, and were bound together by specialties only known tothemselves. The richer of this fraternity were bound to provide for their poorerbrethren. They were divided into communities, governed by a Master and Wardens,and called γυνoκα (connected houses). They held a grand festival annually, andwere held in high esteem. Their ceremonials were regarded as sacred. It has beenclaimed that Solomon, at the instance of Hiram, King of Tyre, employed them athis temple and palaces. They were also employed at the construction of theTemple of Diana at Ephesus. They had means of intercommunication all over thethen known world, and from them, doubtless, sprang the guilds of the TravelingMasons known in the Middle Ages.” (See The Obelisk and Freemasonry. )The fraternity of the Dionysiac Architects spread throughout all of Asia Minor,even reaching Egypt and India. They established themselves in nearly all thecountries bordering on the Mediterranean, and with the rise of the Roman Empirefound their way into Central Europe and even into England. The most stately andenduring buildings in Constantinople, Rhodes, Athens, and Rome were erected bythese inspired craftsmen. One of the most illustrious of their number wasVitruvius, the great architect, renowned as the author of De Architectura LibriDecem. In the various sections of his book Vitruvius gives several hints as tothe philosophy underlying the Dionysiac concept of the principle of symmetryapplied to the science of architecture, as derived from a consideration of theproportions established by Nature between the parts and members of the humanbody. The following extract from Vitruvius on the subject of symmetry isrepresentative:“The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which must bemost carefully observed by the architect. They are due to proportion, in’αναλoγα. Proportion is a correspondence among the measures of the members of anentire work, and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard. From thisresult the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can beno principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no preciserelation between its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man. Forthe human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the chin to the topof the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the wholeheight; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just thesame; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck andshoulder from the top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth;from the middle of the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we takethe height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to theunder side of the nostrils [and from that point] to a line between the eyebrowsis the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third,comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height ofthe body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also onefourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and itwas by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquityattained to great and endless renown.”The edifices raised by the Dionysiac Builders were indeed “sermons in stone.”Though unable to comprehend fully the cosmic principles thus embodied in thesemasterpieces of human ingenuity and industry, even the uninitiated wereinvariably overwhelmed by the sense of majesty and symmetry resulting from theperfect coordination of pillars, spans, arches, and domes. By variations in thedetails of size, material, type, arrangement, ornamentation, and color, theseinspired builders believed it possible to provoke in the nature of the onlookercertain distinct mental or emotional reactions. Vitruvius, for example,describes the disposition of bronze vases about a room so as to produce certaindefinite changes in the tone and quality of the human voice. In like manner,each chamber in the Mysteries through which the candidate passed had its ownpeculiar acoustics. Thus in one chamber the voice of the priest was amplifieduntil his words caused the very room to vibrate, while in another the voice wasdiminished and softened to such a degree that it sounded like the distanttinkling of silver bells. Again, in some of the underground passageways thecandidate was apparently bereft of the power of speech, for though he shouted atthe top of his voice not even a whisper was audible to his ears. Afterprogressing a few feet, however, he would discover that his softest sigh wouldbe reechoed a hundred times.The supreme ambition of the Dionysiac Architects was the construction ofbuildings which would create distinct impressions consistent with the purposefor which the structure itself was designed. In common with the Pythagoreans,they believed it possible by combinations of straight lines and curves to induceany desired mental attitude or emotion. They labored, therefore, to the end ofproducing a building perfectly harmonious with the structure of the universeitself. They may have even believed that an edifice so constructed-because itwas in no respect at variance with any existing reality—would not be subject todissolution but would endure throughout the span of mortal time. As a logicaldeduction from their philosophic trend of thought, such a building—en rapportwith Cosmos—would also have become an oracle. Certain early works on magicalphilosophy hint that the Ark of the Covenant was oracular in character becauseof specially prepared chambers in its interior. These by their shape andarrangement were so attuned to the vibrations of the invisible world that theycaught and amplified the voices of the ages imprinted upon and eternallyexistent in the substance of the astral light.Unskilled in these ancient subtleties of their profession, modern architectsoften create architectural absurdities which would cause their creators to blushwith shame did they comprehend their actual symbolic import. Thus, phallicemblems are strewn in profusion among the adornments of banks, office buildings,and department stores. Christian churches also may be surmounted with Brahmin orMohammedan domes or be designed in a style suitable for a Jewish synagogue or aGreek temple to Pluto. These incongruities may be considered trivial inimportance by the modern designer, but to the trained psychologist the purposefor which a building was erected is frustrated in large measure by the presenceof such architectural discordances. Vitruvius thus defines the principle ofpropriety as conceived and applied by the Dionysians:“Propriety is that perfection of style which comes when a work is authorita-tively constructed on approved principles. It arises from prescription (Greekθεµατσµ), from usage, or from nature. From prescription, in the case ofhypæthral edifices, open to the sky, in honour of Jupiter Lightning, the Heaven,the Sun, or the Moon: for these are gods whose semblances and manifestations webehold before our very eyes in the sky when it is cloudless and bright. Thetemples of Minerva, Mars, and Hercules will be Doric, since the virile strengthof these gods makes daintiness entirely inappropriate to their houses. Intemples to Venus, Flora, Proserpine, Spring-Water, and the Nymphs, theCorinthian order will be found to have peculiar significance, because these aredelicate divinities and so its rather slender outlines, its flowers, leaves, andornamental volutes will lend propriety where it is due. The construction oftemples of the Ionic order to Juno, Diana, Father Bacchus, and the other gods ofthat kind, will be in keeping with the middle position which they hold; for thebuilding of such will be an appropriate combination of the severity of the Doricand the delicacy of the Corinthian.”In describing the societies of Ionian artificers, Joseph Da Costa declares theDionysiac rites to have been founded upon the science of astronomy, which by theinitiates of this order was correlated to the builder’s art. In variousdocuments dealing with the origin of architecture are found hints to the effectthat the great buildings erected by these initiated craftsmen were based upongeometrical patterns derived from the constellations. Thus, a temple might beplanned according to the constellation of Pegasus or a court of judgment modeledafter the constellation of the Scales. The Dionysians evolved a peculiar code bywhich they were able to communicate with one another in the dark and both thesymbols and the terminology of their guild were derived, in the main, from theelements of architecture.While stigmatized as pagans by reason of their philosophic principles, it isnoteworthy that these Dionysiac craftsmen were almost universally employed inthe erection of early Christian abbeys and cathedrals, whose stones even to thisvery day bear distinguishing marks and symbols cut into their surfaces by theseillustrious builders. Among the ornate carvings upon the fronts of greatchurches of the Old World are frequently found representations of compasses,squares, rules, mallets, and clusters of builders’ tools skillfully incorporatedinto mural decorations and even placed in the hands of the effigies of saintsand prophets standing in exalted niches. A great mystery was contained in theancient portals of the Cathedral of Notre Dame which were destroyed during theFrench Revolution, for among their carvings were numerous Rosicrucian andMasonic emblems; and according to the records preserved by alchemists whostudied their bas-reliefs, the secret processes for metallic transmutation wereset forth in their grotesque yet most significant figures.The checkerboard floor upon which the modern Freemasonic lodge stands is the oldtracing board of the Dionysiac Architects, and while the modern organization isno longer limited to workmen’s guilds it still preserves in its symbols themetaphysical doctrines of the ancient society of which it is presumably theoutgrowth. The investigator of the origin of Freemasonic symbolism who desiresto trace the development of the order through the ages will find a practicalsuggestion in the following statement of Charles W. Heckethorn:“But considering that Freemasonry is a tree the roots of which spread through somany soils, it follows that traces thereof must be found in its fruit; that itslanguage and ritual should retain much of the various sects and institutions ithas passed through before arriving at their present state, and in Masonry wemeet with Indian, Egyptian, Jewish, and Christian ideas, terms, and symbols.”(See The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries.)The Roman Collegia of skilled architects were apparently a subdivision of thegreater Ionian body, their principles and organization being practicallyidentical with the older Ionian institution. It has been suspected that theDionysians also profoundly influenced early Islamic culture, for part of theirsymbolism found its way into the Mysteries of the dervishes. At one time theDionysians referred to themselves as Sons of Solomon, and one of the mostimportant of their symbols was the Seal of Solomon—two interlaced triangles.This motif is frequently seen in conspicuous parts of Mohammedan mosques. TheKnights Templars—who were suspected of anything and everything—are believed tohave contacted these Dionsyiac artificers and to have introduced many of theirsymbols and doctrines into mediaeval Europe. But Freemasonry most of all owes tothe Dionysiac cult the great mass of its symbols and rituals which are relatedto the science of architecture. From these ancient and illustrious artisans italso received the legacy of the unfinished Temple of Civilization—that vast,invisible structure upon which these initiated builders have laboredcontinuously since the inception of their fraternity This mighty edifice, whichhas fallen and been rebuilt time after time but whose foundations remainunmoved, is the true Everlasting House of which the temple on the brow of MountMoriah was but an impermanent symbol.Aside from the operative aspect of their order, the Dionysiac Architects had aspeculative philosophic code. Human society they considered as a rough anduntrued ashlar but lately chiseled from the quarry of elemental Nature. Thiscrude block was the true object upon which these skilled craftsmenlabored—polishing it, squaring it, and with the aid of fine carvingstransforming it into a miracle of beauty. While mystics released their soulsfrom the bondage of matter by meditation and philosophers found their keenestJoy in the profundities of thought, these master workmen achieved liberationfrom the Wheel of Life and Death by learning to swing their hammers with thesame rhythm that moves the swirling forces of Cosmos. They venerated the Deityunder the guise of a Great Architect and Master Craftsman who was ever gougingrough ashlars from the fields of space and truing them into universes. TheDionysians affirmed constructiveness to be the supreme expression of the soul,and attuning themselves with the ever-visible constructive natural processesgoing on around them, believed immortality could be achieved by thus becoming apart of the creative agencies of Nature."},{"pageContent":"SOLOMON, THE PERSONIFICATION OF UNIVERSAL WISDOM The name Solomon may be divided into three syllables, SOL-OM-ON, symbolizinglight, glory, and truth collectively and respectively. The Temple of Solomon is,therefore, first of all “the House of Everlasting Light,” its earthly symbolbeing the temple of stone on the brow of Mount Moriah. According to the Mysteryteachings, there are three Temples of Solomon—as there are three Grand Masters,three Witnesses, and three Tabernacles of the Transfiguration. The first templeis the Grand House of the Universe, in the midst of which sits the sun (SOL)upon his golden throne. The twelve signs of the zodiac as Fellow-Craftsmengather around their shining lord. Three lights—the stellar, the solar, and thelunar—illuminate this Cosmic Temple. Accompanied by his retinue of planets,moons, and asteroids, this Divine King (SOLomon), whose glory no earthly monarchshall ever equal, passes in stately pomp down the avenues of space. WhereasCHiram represents the active physical light of the sun, SOLomon signifies itsinvisible but all-powerful, spiritual and intellectual effulgency.The second symbolic temple is the human body—the Little House made in the imageof the Great Universal House. “Know ye not,” asked the Apostle Paul, “that yeare the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” Freemasonrywithin a temple of stone cannot be other than speculative, but Freemasonrywithin the living temple of the body is operative. The third symbolic temple isthe Soular House, an invisible structure, the comprehension of which is asupreme Freemasonic arcanum. The mystery of this intangible edifice is concealedunder the allegory of the Soma Psuchicon, or Wedding Garment described by St.Paul, the Robes of Glory of the High Priest of Israel, the Yellow Robe of theBuddhist monk, and the Robe of Blue and Gold to which Albert Pike refers in hisSymbolism. The soul, constructed from an invisible fiery substance, a flaminggolden metal, is cast by the Master Workman, CHiram Abiff, into the mold of clay(the physical body) and is called the Molten Sea. The temple of the human soulis built by three Master Masons personifying Wisdom, Love, and Service, and whenconstructed according to the Law of Life the spirit of God dwells in the HolyPlace thereof. The Soular Temple is the true Everlasting House, and he who canraise or cast it is a Master Mason indeed! The best-informed Masonic writershave realized that Solomon’s Temple is a representation in miniature of theUniversal Temple. Concerning this point, A. E. Waite, in A New Encyclopœdia ofFreemasonry, writes: “It is macrocosmic in character, so that the Temple is asymbol of the universe, a type of manifestation itself.”Solomon, the Spirit of Universal Illumination—mental, spiritual, moral, andphysical—is personified in the king of an earthly nation. While a great ruler bythat name may have built a temple, he who considers the story solely from itshistorical angle will never clear away the rubbish that covers the secretvaults. The rubbish is interpolated matter in the form of superficial symbols,allegories, and degrees which have no legitimate part in the originalFreemasonic Mysteries. Concerning the loss of the true esoteric key to Masonicsecrets, Albert Pike writes:“No one journeys now ‘from the high place of Cabaon to the threshing floor ofOman the Yebusite,’ nor has seen, ‘his Master, clothed in blue and gold;’ norare apprentices and Fellow-crafts any longer paid at their respective Columns;nor is the Master’s working tool the Tracing Board, nor does he use in his work‘Chalk, Charcoal, and an Earthen Vessel,’ nor does the Apprentice, becoming aFellow Craft, pass from the square to the compass; for the meanings of thesephrases as symbols have long been lost.”According to the ancient Rabbins, Solomon was an initiate of the Mystery schoolsand the temple which he built was actually a house of initiation containing amass of pagan philosophic and phallic emblems. The pomegranates, the palm-headedcolumns, the pillars before the door, the Babylonian cherubim, and thearrangement of the chambers and draperies all indicate the temple to have beenpatterned after the sanctuaries of Egypt and Atlantis. Isaac Myer, in TheQabbalah, makes the following observation:“The pseudo-Clement of Rome, writes: ‘God made man male and female. The male isChrist: the female, the Church.’ The Qabbalists called the Holy Spirit, themother, and the Church of Israel, the Daughter. Solomon engraved on the walls ofhis Temple, likenesses of the male and female principles, to adumbrate thismystery; such, it is said, were the figures of the cherubim. This was, however,not in obedience to the words of the Thorah. They were symbolical of the Upper,the spiritual, the former or maker, positive or male, and the Lower, thepassive, the negative or female, formed or made by the first.”Masonry came to Northern Africa and Asia Minor from the lost continent ofAtlantis, not under its present name but rather under the general designationSun and Fire Worship. The ancient Mysteries did not cease to exist whenChristianity became the world’s most powerful religion. Great Pan did not die!Freemasonry is the proof of his survival. The pre-Christian Mysteries simplyassumed the symbolism of the new faith, perpetuating through its emblems andallegories the same truths which had been the property of the wise since thebeginning of the world. There is no true explanation, therefore, for Christiansymbols save that which is concealed within pagan philosophy. Without themysterious keys carried by the hierophants of the Egyptian, Brahmin, and Persiancults the gates of Wisdom cannot be opened. Consider with reverent spirit,therefore, the sublime allegory of the Temple and its Builders, realizing thatbeneath its literal interpretation lies hidden a Royal Secret.According to the Talmudic legends, Solomon understood the mysteries of theQabbalah. He was also an alchemist and a necromancer, being able to control thedæmons, and from them and other inhabitants of the invisible worlds he securedmuch of his wisdom. In his translation of Clavicula Solomonis, or The Key ofSolomon the King, a work presumably setting forth the magical secrets gatheredby Solomon and used by him in the conjuration of spirits and which, according toFrank C. Higgins, contains many sidelights on Masonic initiatory rituals, S. L.MacGregor-Mathers recognizes the probability that King Solomon was a magician inthe fullest sense of that word. “I see no reason to doubt,” he affirms, “thetradition which assigns the authorship of the ‘Key’ to King Solomon, for amongothers Josephus, the Jewish historian, especially mentions the magical worksattributed to that monarch; this is confirmed by many Eastern traditions, andhis magical skill is frequently mentioned in the Arabian Nights.”Concerning Solomon’s supernatural powers, Josephus writes in his Eighth Book ofthe Antiquities of the Jews:“Now the sagacity and wisdom which God had bestowed on Solomon was so great thathe exceeded the ancients, in so much that he was no way inferior to theEgyptians, who are said to have been beyond all men in understanding; * * * Godalso enabled him to learn that skill which expelled demons, which is a scienceuseful and sanative to him. He composed such incantations also by whichdistempers are alleviated. And he left behind him the manner of using exor-cisms, by which they drive away demons, so that they never return; and thismethod of cure is of great force unto this day”The mediaeval alchemists were convinced that King Solomon understood the secretprocesses of Hermes by means of which it was possible to multiply metals. Dr.Bacstrom writes that the Universal Spirit (CHiram) assisted King Solomon tobuild his temple, because Solomon being wise in the wisdom of alchemy knew howto control this incorporeal essence and, setting it to work for him, caused theinvisible universe to supply him with vast amounts of gold and silver which mostpeople believed were mined by natural methods.The mysteries of the Islamic faith are now in the keeping of the dervishes—menwho, renouncing worldliness, have withstood the test of a thousand and one daysof temptation. Jelal-ud-din, the great Persian Sufic poet and philosopher, isaccredited with having founded the Order of Mevlevi, or the “dancing dervishes,”whose movements exoterically signify the motions of the celestial bodies andesoterically result in the establishment of a rhythm which stimulates thecenters of spiritual consciousness within the dancer’s body“According to the mystical canon, there are always on earth a certain number ofholy men who are admitted to intimate communion with the Deity. The one whooccupies the highest position among his contemporaries is called the ‘Axis’(Qutb) or ‘Pole’ of his time. * * * Subordinate to the Qtb are two holy beingswho bear the title of ‘The Faithful Ones,’ and are assigned places on his rightand left respectively. Below these is a quartette of intermediate Ones’ (Evtad);and on successively lower planes are five ‘Lights’ (Envr), and seven ‘Very Good’(Akhyar). The next rank is filled by forty ‘Absent Ones’ (Rijal-i-ghaib), alsotermed ‘Martyrs’ (Shuheda). When an ‘Axis’ quits this earthly existence, he issucceeded by the ‘Faithful One’ who has occupied the place at his right hand. ** * For to these holy men, who also bear the collective titles of ‘Lords ofSouls,’ and ‘Directors,’ is committed a spiritual supremacy over mankind farexceeding the temporal authority of earthly rulers.” (See Mysticism and Magic inTurkey, by L. M. J. Garnett.)The Axis is a mysterious individual who, unknown and unsuspected, mingles withmankind and who, according to tradition, has his favorite seat upon the roof ofthe Caaba. J. P. Brown, in The Dervishes, gives a description of these “MasterSouls.”"},{"pageContent":"FREEMASONRY’S PRICELESS HERITAGE The sanctum sanctorum of Freemasonry is ornamented with the gnostic jewels of athousand ages; its rituals ring with the divinely inspired words of seers andsages. A hundred religions have brought their gifts of wisdom to its altar; artsand sciences unnumbered have contributed to its symbolism. Freemasonry is aworld-wide university, teaching the liberal arts and sciences of the soul to allwho will hearken to its words. Its chairs are seats of learning and its pillarsuphold an arch of universal education. Its trestleboards are inscribed with theeternal verities of all ages and upon those who comprehend its sacred depths hasdawned the realization that within the Freemasonic Mysteries lie hidden thelong-lost arcana sought by all peoples since the genesis of human reason.The philosophic power of Freemasonry lies in its symbols—its priceless heritagefrom the Mystery schools of antiquity. In a letter to Robert Freke Gould, AlbertPike writes:“It began to shape itself to my intellectual vision into something more imposingand majestic, solemnly mysterious and grand. It seemed to me like the Pyramidsin their loneliness, in whose yet undiscovered chambers may be hidden, for theenlightenment of coming generations, the sacred books of the Egyptians, so longlost to the world; like the Sphynx half buried in the desert. In its symbolism,which and its spirit of brotherhood are its essence, Freemasonry is more ancientthan any of the world’s living religions. It has the symbols and doctrineswhich, older than himself, Zarathustra inculcated; and it seemed to me aspectacle sublime, yet pitiful—the ancient Faith of our ancestors holding out tothe world its symbols once so eloquent, and mutely and in vain asking for aninterpreter. And so I came at last to see that the true greatness and majesty ofFreemasonry consist in its proprietorship of that and its other symbols; andthat its symbolism is its soul.”Though the temples of Thebes and Karnak be now but majestic heaps of broken andtime-battered stone, the spirit of Egyptian philosophy still marches triumphantthrough the centuries. Though the rock-hewn sanctuaries of the ancient Brahminsbe now deserted and their carvings crumbled into dust, still the wisdom of theVedas endures. Through the oracles be silenced and the House of the Mysteries benow but rows of ghostly columns, still shines the spiritual glory of Hellas withluster undiminished. Though Zoroaster, Hermes, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotleare now but dim memories in a world once rocked by the transcendency of theirintellectual genius, still in the mystic temple of Freemasonry these god-menlive again in their words and symbols; and the candidate, passing through theinitiations, feels himself face-to-face with these illumined hierophants of dayslong past."},{"pageContent":"XLI Mystic Christianity The true story of the life of Jesus of Nazareth has never been unfolded to theworld, either in the accepted Gospels or in the Apocrypha, although a few strayhints may be found in some of the commentaries written by the ante-NiceneFathers. The facts concerning His identity and mission are among the pricelessmysteries preserved to this day in the secret vaults beneath the “Houses of theBrethren.” To a few of the Knights Templars, who were initiated into the arcanaof the Druses, Nazarenes, Essenes, Johannites, and other sects still inhabitingthe remote and inaccessible fastnesses of the Holy Land, part of the strangestory was told. The knowledge of the Templars concerning the early history ofChristianity was undoubtedly one of the main reasons for their persecution andfinal annihilation. The discrepancies in the writings of the early ChurchFathers not only are irreconcilable, but demonstrate beyond question that evenduring the first five centuries after Christ these learned men had for thebasis. of their writings little more substantial than folklore and hearsay. Tothe easy believer everything is possible and there are no problems. Theunemotional person in search of facts, however, is confronted by a host ofproblems with uncertain factors, of which the following are typical:According to popular conception, Jesus was crucified during the thirty-thirdyear of His life and in the third year of His ministry following His baptism.About A.D. 180, St. Irenæus, Bishop of Lyons, one of the most eminent of theante-Nicene theologians, wrote Against Heresies, an attack on the doctrines ofthe Gnostics. In this work Irenæus declared upon the authority of the Apostlesthemselves that Jesus lived to old age. To quote: “They, however, that they mayestablish their false opinion regarding that which is written, ‘to proclaim theacceptable year of the Lord,’ maintain that He preached for one year only, andthen suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus], they are forgetful oftheir own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that agewhich is both more necessary and more honourable than any other; that moreadvanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. Forhow could He have had His disciples, if He did not teach? And how could He havetaught, unless He had reached the age of a Master? For when He came to bebaptised, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to beabout thirty years of age (for thus Luke, who has mentioned His years, hasexpressed it: ‘Now Jesus was, as it were, beginning to be thirty years old,’when He came to receive baptism); and, (according to these men,) He preachedonly one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year Hesuffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained toadvanced age. Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty years, andthat this extends onward to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but fromthe fourtieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, whichOur Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as theGospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John,the disciple of the Lord, (affirming) that John conveyed to them thatinformation. And he remained among them up to the time of Trajan. Some of them,moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and heard the verysame account from them, and bear testimony as to the (validity of) thestatement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as these, orPtolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his dreamsattained to the slightest trace of an apostle?”239 [images/00240.jpg] THE ROUND TABLE OF KING ARTHUR.According to tradition, Arthur, when a boy of fifteen, was crowned King ofBritain, in A.D. 516. Soon after his ascension to the throne he founded theOrder of the Knights of the Round Table at Windsor. Thereafter the Knights metannually at Carleon, Winchester or at Camelot, to celebrate Pentecost. From allparts of Europe came the brave and the bold, seeking admission into this nobleorder of British knighthood. Nobility, virtue, and valor were its requirements,and those possessing these qualities to a marked degree were welcomed to KingArthur’s court at Camelot. Having gathered the bravest and noblest Knights ofEurope about him, King Arthur chose twenty-four who excelled all the others indaring and integrity and formed of them his Circle of the Round Table. Accordingto legend, each of these Knights was so great in dignity and power that nonecould occupy a more exalted seat than another, so when they gathered at thetable to celebrate the anniversary of their foundation it was necessary to use around table that all might occupy chairs of equal importance.While it is probable that the Order of the Round Table had its distinctiverituals and symbols, the knowledge of them has not survived the ages. EliasAshmole, in his volume on the Order of the Garter, inserted a double-page plateshowing the insignia of all the orders of knighthood, the block set aside forthe symbol of the Round Table being left blank. The chief reason for the loss ofthe symbolism of the Round Table was the untimely death of King Arthur upon thefield of Kamblan (A.D. 542) in the forty-first year of his life. While hedestroyed his bitter enemy, Mordred, in this famous battle, it cost him not onlyhis own life but the lives of nearly all his Knights of the Round Table, whodied defending their commander. Commenting on the foregoing passage, Godfrey Higgins remarks that it hasfortunately escaped the hands of those destroyers who have attempted to renderthe Gospel narratives consistent by deleting all such statements. He also notesthat the doctrine of the crucifixion was a vexata questio among Christians evenduring the second century. “The evidence of Irenæus,” he says, “cannot betouched. On every principle of sound criticism, and of the doctrine ofprobabilities, it is unimpeachable.”It should further be noted that Irenæus prepared this statement to contradictanother apparently current in his time to the effect that the ministry of Jesuslasted but one year. Of all the early Fathers, Irenæus, writing within eightyyears after the death of St. John the Evangelist, should have had reasonablyaccurate information. If the disciples themselves related that Jesus lived toadvanced age in the body, why has the mysterious number 33 been arbitrarilychosen to symbolize the duration of His life? Were the incidents in the life ofJesus purposely altered so that His actions would fit more closely into thepattern established by the numerous Savior-Gods who preceded Him? That theseanalogies were recognized and used as a leverage in converting the Greeks andRomans is evident from a perusal of the writings of Justin Martyr, anothersecond-century authority. In his Apology, Justin addresses the pagans thus:“And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was producedwithout sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified anddied, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing differentfrom what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. * * * Andif we assert that the Word of God was born of God in a peculiar manner,different from ordinary generation, let this, as said above, be no extraordinarything to you, who say that Mercury is the angelic word of God. But if any oneobjects that He was crucified, in this also He is on a par with those reputedsons of Jupiter of yours, who suffered as we have now enumerated.”From this it is evident that the first missionaries of the Christian Church werefar more willing to admit the other similarities between their faith and thefaiths of the pagans than were their successors in later centuries.In an effort to solve some of the problems arising from any attempt to chronicleaccurately the life of Jesus, it has been suggested that there may have lived inSyria at that time two or more religious teachers bearing the name Jesus,Jehoshua or Joshua, and that the lives of these men may have been confused inthe Gospel stories. In his Secret Sects of Syria and the Lebanon, Bernard H.Springett, a Masonic author, quotes from an early book, the name of which he wasnot at liberty to disclose because of its connection with the ritual of a sect.The last part of his quotation is germane to the subject at hand:“But Jehovah prospered the seed of the Essenians, in holiness and love, for manygenerations. Then came the chief of the angels, according to the commandment ofGOD, to raise up an heir to the Voice of Jehovah. And, in four generations more,an heir was born, and named Joshua, and he was the child of Joseph and Mara,devout worshippers of Jehovah, who stood aloof from all other people save theEssenians. And this Joshua, in Nazareth, reestablished Jehovah, and restoredmany of the lost rites and ceremonies. In the thirty-sixth year of his age hewas stoned to death in Jerusalem * * *.”Within the last century several books have been published to supplement themeager descriptions in the Gospels of Jesus and His ministry. In some instancesthese narratives claim to be founded upon early manuscripts recently discovered;in others, upon direct spiritual revelation. Some of these writings are highlyplausible, while others are incredible. There are persistent rumors that Jesusvisited and studied in both Greece and India, and that a coin struck in Hishonor in India during the first century has been discovered. Early Christianrecords are known to exist in Tibet, and the monks of a Buddhist monastery inCeylon still preserve a record which indicates that Jesus sojourned with themand became conversant with their philosophyAlthough early Christianity shows every evidence of Oriental influence, this isa subject the modern church declines to discuss. If it is ever establishedbeyond question that Jesus was an initiate of the pagan Greek or AsiaticMysteries, the effect upon the more conservative members of the Christian faithis likely to be cataclysmic. If Jesus was God incarnate, as the solemn councilsof the church discovered, why is He referred to in the New Testament as “calledof God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek”? The words “after theorder” make Jesus one of a line or order of which there must have been others ofequal or even superior dignity If the “Melchizedeks” were the divine or priestlyrulers of the nations of the earth before the inauguration of the system oftemporal rulers, then the statements attributed to St. Paul would indicate thatJesus either was one of these “philosophic elect” or was attempting toreestablish their system of government. It will be remembered that Melchizedekalso performed the same ceremony of the drinking of wine and the breaking ofbread as did Jesus at the Last Supper.George Faber declares the original name of Jesus was Jescua Hammassiah. GodfreyHiggins has discovered two references, one in the Midrashjoheleth and the otherin the Abodazara (early Jewish commentaries on the Scriptures), to the effectthat the surname of Joseph’s family was Panther, for in both of these works itis stated that a man was healed “in the name of Jesus ben Panther.” The namePanther establishes a direct connection between Jesus and Bacchus—who was nursedby panthers and is sometimes depicted riding either on one of these animals orin a chariot drawn by them. The skin of the panther was also sacred in certainof the Egyptian initiatory ceremonials. The monogram IHS, now interpreted tomean Iesus Hominum Salvator (Jesus Savior of Men), is another direct linkbetween the Christian and the Bacchic rites. IHS is derived from the Greek YHΣ,which, as its numerical value (608) signifies, is emblematic of the sun andconstituted the sacred and concealed name of Bacchus. (See The Celtic Druids byGodfrey Higgins.) The question arises, Was early Roman Christianity confusedwith the worship of Bacchus because of the numerous parallelisms in the twofaiths? If the affirmative can be proved, many hitherto incomprehensible enigmasof the New Testament will be solved.It is by no means improbable that Jesus Himself originally propounded asallegories the cosmic activities which were later confused with His own life.That the Xρστóς, Christos, represents the solar power reverenced by every nationof antiquity cannot be controverted. If Jesus revealed the nature and purpose ofthis solar power under the name and personality of Christos, thereby giving tothis abstract power the attributes of a god-man, He but followed a precedent setby all previous World-Teachers. This god-man, thus endowed with all thequalities of Deity, signifies the latent divinity in every man. Mortal manachieves deification only through at-one-ment with this divine Self. Union withthe immortal Self is therefore “saved.” This Christos, or divine man in man, isman’s real hope of salvation—the living Mediator between abstract Deity andmortal humankind. As Atys, Adonis, Bacchus, and Orpheus in all likelihood wereoriginally illumined men who later were confused with the symbolic personageswhom they created as personifications of this divine power, so Jesus has beenconfused with the Christos, or god-man, whose wonders He preached. Since theChristos was the god-man imprisoned in every creature, it was the first duty ofthe initiate to liberate, or “resurrect,” this Eternal One within himself. Hewho attained reunion with his Christos was consequently termed a Christian, orChristened, man.One of the most profound doctrines of the pagan philosophers concerned theUniversal Savior-God who lifted the souls of regenerated men to heaven throughHis own nature. This concept was unquestionably the inspiration for the wordsattributed to Jesus: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh untothe Father but by me.” In an effort to make a single person out of Jesus and HisChristos, Christian writers have patched together a doctrine which must beresolved back into its original constituents if the true meaning of Christianityis to be rediscovered. In the Gospel narratives the Christos represents theperfect man who, having passed through the various stages of the “World Mystery”symbolized by the thirty-three years, ascends to the heaven sphere where he isreunited with his Eternal Father. The story of Jesus as now preserved is—likethe Masonic story of Hiram Abiff—part of a secret initiatory ritualism belongingto the early Christian and pagan Mysteries.During the centuries just prior to the Christian Era, the secrets of the paganMysteries had gradually fallen into the hands of the profane. To the student ofcomparative religion it is evident that these secrets, gathered by a small groupof faithful philosophers and mystics, were reclothed in new symbolical garmentsand thus preserved for several centuries under the name of Mystic Christianity.It is generally supposed that the Essenes were the custodians of this knowledgeand also the initiators and educators of Jesus. If so, Jesus was undoubtedlyinitiated in the same temple of Melchizedek where Pythagoras had studied sixcenturies before.The Essenes—the most prominent of the early Syrian sects—were an order of piousmen and women who lived lives of asceticism, spending their days in simple laborand their evenings in prayer. Josephus, the great Jewish historian, speaks ofthem in the highest terms. “They teach the immortality of the soul,” he says,“and esteem that the rewards of righteousness are to be earnestly striven for.”In another place he adds, “Yet is their course of life better than that of othermen and they entirely addict themselves to husbandry.” The name Essenes issupposed to be derived from an ancient Syrian word meaning “physician,” andthese kindly folk are believed to have held as their purpose of existence thehealing of the sick in mind, soul, and body. According to Edouard Schuré, theyhad two principal communities, or centers, one in Egypt on the banks of LakeMaoris, the other in Palestine at Engaddi, near the Dead Sea. Some authoritiestrace the Essenes back to the schools of Samuel the Prophet, but most agree oneither an Egyptian or Oriental origin. Their methods of prayer, meditation, andfasting were not unlike those of the holy men of the Far East. Membership in theEssene Order was possible only after a year of probation. This Mystery school,like so many others, had three degrees, and only a few candidates passedsuccessfully through all. The Essenes were divided into two distinctcommunities, one consisting of celibates and the other of members who weremarried.The Essenes never became merchants or entered into the commercial life ofcities, but maintained themselves by agriculture and the raising of sheep forwool; also by such crafts as pottery and carpentry. In the Gospels andApocrypha, Joseph, the father of Jesus, is referred to as both a carpenter and apotter. In the Apocryphal Gospel of Thomas and also that of Pseudo-Matthew, thechild Jesus is described as making sparrows out of clay which came to life andflew away when he clapped his hands. The Essenes were regarded as among thebetter educated class of Jews and there are accounts of their having been chosenas tutors for the children of Roman officers stationed in Syria. The fact thatso many artificers were listed among their number is responsible for the order’sbeing considered as a progenitor of modern Freemasonry. The symbols of theEssenes include a number of builders’ tools, and they were secretly engaged inthe erection of a spiritual and philosophical temple to serve as a dwellingplace for the living God.Like the Gnostics, the Essenes were emanationists. One of their chief objectswas the reinterpretation of the Mosaic Law according to certain secret spiritualkeys preserved by them from the time of the founding of their order. It wouldthus follow that the Essenes were Qabbalists and, like several othercontemporary sects flourishing in Syria, were awaiting the advent of the Messiahpromised in the early Biblical writings. Joseph and Mary, the parents of Jesus,are believed to have been members of the Essene Order. Joseph was many years thesenior of Mary. According to The Protevangelium, he was a widower with grownsons, and in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew he refers to Mary as a little childless in age than his own grandchildren. In her infancy Mary was dedicated to theLord, and the Apocryphal writings contain many accounts of miracles associatedwith her early childhood. When she was twelve years old, the priests heldcounsel as to the future of this child who had dedicated herself to the Lord,and the Jewish high priest, bearing the breastplate, entered into the Holy ofHolies, where an angel appeared to him, saying, “Zacharias, go forth and summonthe widowers of the people and let them take a rod apiece and she shall be thewife of him to whom the Lord shall show a sign.” Going forth to meet the priestsat the head of the widowers, Joseph collected the rods of all the other men andgave them into the keeping of the priests. Now Joseph’s rod was but half as longas the others, and the priests on returning the rods to the widowers paid noattention to Joseph’s but left it behind in the Holy of Holies. When all theother widowers had received back their wands, the priests awaited a sign fromheaven, but none came. Joseph, because of his advanced age, did not ask for thereturn of his rod, for to him it was inconceivable that he should be chosen. Butan angel appeared to the high priest, ordering him to give back the short rodwhich lay unnoticed in the Holy of Holies. As the high priest handed the rod toJoseph, a white dove flew from the end of it and rested upon the head of theaged carpenter, and to him was given the child.The editor of The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East calls attentionto the peculiar spirit with which the childhood of Jesus is treated in most ofthe Apocryphal books of the New Testament, particularly in one work attributedto the doubting Thomas, the earliest known Greek version of which dates fromabout A.D. 200: “The child Christ is represented almost as an imp, cursing anddestroying those who annoy him.” This Apocryphal work, calculated to inspire itsreaders with fear and trembling, was popular during the Middle Ages because itwas in full accord with the cruel and persecuting spirit of mediaevalChristianity. Like many other early sacred books, the book of Thomas wasfabricated for two closely allied purposes: first, to outshine the pagans inmiracle working; second, to inspire all unbelievers with the “fear of the Lord.”Apocryphal writings of this sort have no possible basis in fact. At one time anasset, the “miracles” of Christianity have become its greatest liability.Supernatural phenomena, in a credulous age interpolated to impress the ignorant,in this century have only achieved the alienation of the intelligent.In The Greek Gospel of Nicodemus it is declared that when Jesus was brought intothe presence of Pilate the standards borne by the Roman guards bowed their topsin homage to him in spite of every effort made by the soldiers to prevent it. InThe Letters of Pilate the statement also appears that Caesar, being wroth atPilate for executing a just man, ordered him to be decapitated. Praying forforgiveness, Pilate was visited by an angel of the Lord, who reassured the Romangovernor by promising him that all Christendom should remember his name and thatwhen Christ came the second time to judge His people he (Pilate) should comebefore Him as His witness.Stories like the foregoing represent the incrustations that have attachedthemselves to the body of Christianity during the centuries. The popular minditself has been the self-appointed guardian and perpetuator of these legends,bitterly opposing every effort to divest the faith of these questionableaccumulations. While popular tradition often contains certain basic elements oftruth, these elements are usually distorted out of all proportion. Thus, whilethe generalities of the story may be fundamentally true, the details arehopelessly erroneous. Of truth as of beauty it may be said that it is mostadorned when unadorned. Through the mist of fantastic accounts which obscure thetrue foundation of the Christian faith is faintly visible to the discerning fewa great and noble doctrine communicated to the world by a great and noble soul.Joseph and Mary, two devout and holy-minded souls, consecrated to the service ofGod and dreaming of the coming of a Messiah to serve Israel, obeyed theinjunctions of the high priest of the Essenes to prepare a body for the comingof a great soul. Thus of an immaculate conception Jesus was born. By immaculateis meant clean, rather than supernatural.Jesus was reared and educated by the Essenes and later initiated into the mostprofound of their Mysteries. Like all great initiates, He must travel in aneasterly direction, and the silent years of His life no doubt were spent infamiliarizing Himself with that secret teaching later to be communicated by Himto the world. Having consummated the ascetic practices of His order, He attainedto the Christening. Having thus reunited Himself with His own spiritual source,He then went forth in the name of the One who has been crucified since beforethe worlds were and, gathering about Him disciples and apostles, He instructedthem in that secret teaching which had been lost—in part, at least—from thedoctrines of Israel. His fate is unknown, but in all probability He sufferedthat persecution which is the lot of those who seek to reconstruct the ethical,philosophical, or religious systems of their day.To the multitudes Jesus spoke in parables; to His disciples He also spoke inparables, though of a more exalted and philosophic nature. Voltaire said thatPlato should have been canonized by the Christian Church, for, being the firstpropounder of the Christos mystery, he contributed more to its fundamentaldoctrines than any other single individual. Jesus disclosed to His disciplesthat the lower world is under the control of a great spiritual being which hadfashioned it according to the will of the Eternal Father. The mind of this greatangel was both the mind of the world and also the worldly mind. So that menshould not die of worldliness the Eternal Father sent unto creation the eldestand most exalted of His powers—the Divine Mind. This Divine Mind offered Itselfas a living sacrifice and was broken up and eaten by the world. Having given Itsspirit and Its body at a secret and sacred supper to the twelve manners ofrational creatures, this Divine Mind became a part of every living thing. Manwas thereby enabled to use this power as a bridge across which he might pass andattain immortality. He who lifted up his soul to this Divine Mind and served Itwas righteous and, having attained righteousness, liberated this Divine Mind,which thereupon returned again in glory to Its own divine source. And because Hehad brought to them this knowledge, the disciples said one to another: “Lo, Heis Himself this Mind personified!”"},{"pageContent":"THE ARTHURIAN CYCLE AND LEGEND OF THE HOLY GRAIL According to legend, the body of the Christos (the Spiritual Law) was given intothe keeping of two men, of whom the Gospels make but brief mention. These wereNicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, both devout men who, though not listed amongthe disciples or apostles of the Christos, were of all men chosen to becustodians of His sacred remains. Joseph of Arimathea was one of the initiatedbrethren and is called by A. E. Waite, in his A New Encyclopœdia of Freemasonry,“the first bishop of Christendom.” Just as the temporal (or visible) power ofthe Holy See was established by St. Peter(?), so the spiritual (or invisible)body of the faith was entrusted to the “Secret Church of the Holy Grail” throughapostolic succession from Joseph of Arimathea, into whose keeping had been giventhe perpetual symbols of the covenant—the ever-flowing cup and the bleedingspear.Presumably obeying instructions of St. Philip, Joseph of Arimathea, carrying thesacred relics, reached Britain after passing through many and varied hardships.Here a site was allotted to him for the erection of a church, and in this mannerGlastonbury Abbey was founded. Joseph planted his staff in the earth and it tookroot, becoming a miraculous thorn bush which blossomed twice a year and which isnow called the Glastonbury thorn. The end of the life of Joseph of Arimathea isunknown. By some it is believed that, like Enoch, he was translated; by others,that he was buried in Glastonbury Abbey. Repeated attempts have been made tofind the Holy Grail, which many believe to have been hidden in a crypt beneaththe ancient abbey. The Glastonbury chalice recently discovered and by the devoutsupposed to be the original Sangreal can scarcely be accepted as genuine by thecritical investigator. Beyond its inherent interest as a relic, like the famousAntioch chalice it actually proves nothing when it is realized that practicallylittle more was known about the Christian Mysteries eighteen centuries ago thancan be discovered today.The origin of the Grail myth, as of nearly every other element in the greatdrama, is curiously elusive. Sufficient foundation for it may be found in thefolk- lore of the British Isles, which contains many accounts of magiccauldrons, kettles, cups, and drinking horns. The earliest Grail legendsdescribe the cup as a veritable horn of plenty. Its contents were inexhaustibleand those who served it never hungered or thirsted. One account states that nomatter how desperately ill a person might be he could not die within eight daysof beholding the cup. Some authorities believe the Holy Grail to be theperpetuation of the holy cup used in the rites of Adonis and Atys. A communioncup or chalice was used in several of the ancient Mysteries, and the god Bacchusis frequently symbolized in the form of a vase, cup, or urn. In Nature worshipthe ever-flowing Grail signifies the bounty of the harvest by which the life ofman is sustained; like Mercury’s bottomless pitcher, it is the inexhaustiblefountain of natural resource. From the evidence at hand it would indeed beerroneous to ascribe a purely Christian origin to the Grail symbolism.In the Arthurian Cycle appears a strange and mysterious figure—Merlin, themagician. In one of the legends concerning him it is declared that when Jesuswas sent to liberate the world from the bondage of evil, the Adversarydetermined to send an Antichrist to undo His labors. The Devil therefore in theform of a horrible dragon overshadowed a young woman who had taken refuge insanctuary to escape the evil which had destroyed her family. When Merlin, herchild, was born he partook of the characteristics of his human mother and demonfather. Merlin, however, did not serve the powers of darkness but, beingconverted to the true light, retained only two of the supernatural powersinherited from his father: prophecy and miracle working. The story of Merlin’sinfernal father must really be considered as an allegorical allusion to the factthat he was a “philosophical son” of the serpent or dragon, a title applied toall initiates of the Mysteries, who thus acknowledge Nature as their mortalmother and wisdom in the form of the serpent or dragon as their immortal father.Confusion of the dragon and serpent with the powers of evil has resulted as aninevitable consequence from misinterpretation of the early chapters of Genesis.Arthur while an infant was given into the keeping of Merlin, the Mage, and inhis youth instructed by him in the secret doctrine and probably initiated intothe deepest secrets of natural magic. With Merlin’s assistance, Arthur becamethe leading general of Britain, a degree of dignity which has been confused withkingship. After Arthur had drawn the sword of Branstock from the anvil and thusestablished his divine right to leadership, Merlin further assisted him tosecure from the Lady of the Lake the sacred sword Excalibur. After theestablishment of the Round Table, having fulfilled his duty, Merlin disappeared,according to one account vanishing into the air, where he still exists as ashadow communicating at will with mortals; according to another, retiring of hisown accord into a great stone vault which he sealed from within.It is reasonably certain that many legends regarding Charlemagne were laterassociated with Arthur, who is most famous for establishing the Order of theRound Table at Winchester. Reliable information is not to be had concerning theceremonies and initiatory rituals of the “Table Round.” In one story the Tablewas endowed with the powers of expansion and contraction so that fifteen orfifteen hundred could be seated around it, according to whatever need mightarise. The most common accounts fix the number of knights who could be seated atone time at the Round Table at either twelve or twenty-four. The twelve,signified the signs of the zodiac and also the apostles of Jesus. The knights’names and also their heraldic arms were emblazoned upon their chairs. Whentwenty-four are shown seated at the Table, each of the twelve signs of thezodiac is divided into two parts—a light and a dark half—to signify thenocturnal and diurnal phases of each sign. As each sign of the zodiac isascending for two hours every day, so the twenty-four knights represent thehours, the twenty-four elders before the throne in Revelation, and twenty-fourPersian deities who represent the spirits of the divisions of the day. In thecenter of the Table was the symbolic rose of the Passion of Our Lord JesusChrist, the symbol of resurrection in that He “rose” from the dead. There wasalso a mysterious empty seat called the Siege Perilous in which none might sitexcept he who was successful in his quest for the Holy Grail.In the personality of Arthur is to be found a new form of the ever-recurrentcosmic myth. The prince of Britain is the sun, his knights are the zodiac, andhis flashing sword may be the sun’s ray with which he fights and vanquishes thedragons of darkness or it may represent the earth’s axis. Arthur’s Round Tableis the universe; the Siege Perilous the throne of the perfect man. In itsterrestrial sense, Arthur was the Grand Master of a secret Christian-Masonicbrotherhood of philosophic mystics who termed themselves Knights. Arthurreceived the exalted position of Grand Master of these Knights because he hadfaithfully accomplished the withdrawal of the sword (spirit) from the anvil ofthe base metals (his lower nature). As invariably happens, the historical Arthursoon was confused with the allegories and myths of his order until now the twoare inseparable. After Arthur’s death on the field of Kamblan his Mysteriesceased, and esoterically he was borne away on a black barge, as is sobeautifully described by Tennyson in his Morte d’Arthur. The great swordExcalibur was also cast back into the waters of eternity—all of which is a vividportrayal of the descent of cosmic night at the end of the Day of UniversalManifestation. The body of the historical Arthur was probably interred atGlastonbury Abbey, a building closely identified with the mystic rites of boththe Grail and the Arthurian Cycle.The mediaeval Rosicrucians were undoubtedly in possession of the true secret ofthe Arthurian Cycle and the Grail legend, much of their symbolism having beenincorporated into that order. Though the most obvious of all keys to theChristos mystery, the Grail legend has received the least consideration."},{"pageContent":"XLII The Cross and the Crucifixion In Pagan and Christian Mysticism One of the most interesting legends concerning the cross is that preserved inAurea Legenda, by Jacobus de Vorgaine. The story is to the effect that Adam,feeling the end of his life was near, entreated his son Seth to make apilgrimage to the Garden of Eden and secure from the angel on guard at theentrance the Oil of Mercy which God had promised mankind. Seth did not know theway; but his father told him it was in an eastward direction, and the path wouldbe easy to follow, for when Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of theLord, upon the path which their feet had trod the grass had never grown.Seth, following the directions of his father, discovered the Garden of Edenwithout difficulty. The angel who guarded the gate permitted him to enter, andin the midst of the garden Seth beheld a great tree, the branches of whichreached up to heaven. The tree was in the form of a cross, and stood on thebrink of a precipice which led downward into the depths of hell. Among the rootsof the tree he saw the body of his brother Cain, held prisoner by the entwininglimbs. The angel refused to give Seth the Oil of Mercy, but presented himinstead with three seeds from the Tree of Life (some say the Tree of Knowledge).With these Seth returned to his father, who was so overjoyed that he did notdesire to live longer. Three days later he died, and the three seeds were buriedin his mouth, as the angel had instructed. The seeds became a sapling with threetrunks in one, which absorbed into itself the blood of Adam, so that the life ofAdam was in the tree. Noah dug up this tree by the roots and took it with himinto the Ark. After the waters subsided, he buried the skull of Adam under MountCalvary, and planted the tree on the summit of Mount Lebanon.240 [images/00241.jpg] HISTORY OF THE HOLY CROSS.(1) Adam directing Seth how to reach the Garden of Eden. (2) Seth placing thethree seeds from the Tree of Life under the tongue of the dead Adam. (3) TheQueen of Sheba, refusing to place her feet upon the sacred tree, forded thestream. (4) Placing the sacred tree over the door of Solomon’s Temple. (5) Thecrucifixion of Christ upon a cross made from the wood of the holy tree. (6)Distinguishing the true cross from the other two by testing its power to raise acorpse to life. Moses beheld a visionary being in the midst of this tree (the burning bush) andfrom it cut the magical rod with which he was able to bring water out of astone. But because he failed to call upon the Lord the second time he struck therock he was not permitted to carry the sacred staff into the Promised Land; sohe planted it in the hills of Moab. After much searching, King David discoveredthe tree; and his son, Solomon, tried to use it for a pillar in his Temple, buthis carpenters could not cut it so that it would fit; it was always either toolong or too short. At last, disgusted, they cast it aside and used it for abridge to connect Jerusalem with the surrounding hills. When the Queen of Shebacame to visit King Solomon she was expected to walk across this bridge. Instead,when she beheld the tree, she refused to put her foot upon it, but, afterkneeling and praying, removed her sandals and forded the stream. This soimpressed King Solomon that he ordered the log to be overlaid with golden platesand placed above the door of his Temple. There it remained until his covetousgrandson stole the gold, and buried the tree so that the crime would not bediscovered.From the ground where the tree was buried there immediately bubbled forth aspring of water, which became known as Bethesda. To it the sick from all Syriacame to be healed. The angel of the pool became the guardian of the tree, and itremained undisturbed for many years. Eventually the log floated to the surfaceand was used as a bridge again, this time between Calvary and Jerusalem; andover it Jesus passed to be crucified. There was no wood on Calvary; so the treewas cut into two parts to serve as the cross upon which the Son of Man wascrucified. The cross was set up at the very spot where the skull of Adam hadbeen buried. Later, when the cross was discovered by the Empress Helena, thewood was found to be of four different varieties contained in one tree(representing the elements), and thereafter the cross continued to heal all thesick who were permitted to touch it.The prevalent idea that the reverence for the cross is limited to the Christianworld is disproved by even the most superficial investigation of its place inreligious symbolism. The early Christians used every means possible to concealthe pagan origin of their symbols, doctrines, and rituals. They either destroyedthe sacred books of other peoples among whom they settled, or made theminaccessible to students of comparative philosophy, apparently believing that inthis way they could stamp out all record of the pre-Christian origin of theirdoctrines. In some cases the writings of various ancient authors were tamperedwith, passages of a compromising nature being removed or foreign materialinterpolated. The supposedly spurious passage in Josephus concerning Jesus is anexample adduced to illustrate this proclivity."},{"pageContent":"THE LOST LIBRARIES OF ALEXANDRIA Prior to the Christian Era seven hundred thousand of the most valuable books,written upon parchment, papyrus, vellum, and wax, and also tablets of stone,terra cotta, and wood, were gathered from all parts of the ancient world andhoused in Alexandria, in buildings specially prepared for the purpose. Thismagnificent repository of knowledge was destroyed by a series of three fires.The parts that escaped the conflagration lighted by Caesar to destroy the fleetin the harbor were destroyed about A.D. 389 by the Christians in obedience tothe edict of Theodosius, who had ordered the destruction of the Serapeum, abuilding sacred to Serapis in which the volumes were kept. This conflagration issupposed to have destroyed the library that Marcus Antonius had presented toCleopatra to compensate in part for that burned in the fire of the year 51.Concerning this, H. P. Blavatsky, in Isis Unveiled, has written: “They [theRabbis of Palestine and the wise men] say that not all the rolls andmanuscripts, reported in history to have been burned by Caesar, by the Christianmob, in 389, and by the Arab General Amru, perished as it is commonly believed;and the story they tell is the following: At the time of the contest for thethrone, in 51 B.C., between Cleopatra and her brother Dionysius Ptolemy, theBruckion, which contained over seven hundred thousand rolls all bound in woodand fire-proof parchment, was undergoing repairs and a great portion of theoriginal manuscripts, considered among the most precious, and which were notduplicated, were stored away in the home of one of the librarians. * * * Severalhours passed between the burning of the fleet, set on fire by Caesar’s order,and the moment when the first buildings situated near the harbor caught fire intheir turn; and * * * the librarians, aided by several hundred slaves attachedto the museum, succeeded in saving the most precious of the rolls.” In allprobability, the books which were saved lie buried either in Egypt or in India,and until they are discovered the modern world must remain in ignoranceconcerning many great philosophical and mystical truths. The ancient world moreclearly understood these missing links—the continuity of the pagan Mysteries inChristianity."},{"pageContent":"THE CROSS IN PAGAN SYMBOLISM In his article on the Cross and Crucifixion in the Encyclopœdia Britannica,Thomas Macall Fallow casts much light on the antiquity of this ideograph. “Theuse of the cross as a religious symbol in pre-Christian times, and amongnon-Christian peoples, may probably be regarded as almost universal, and in verymany cases it was connected with some form of nature worship.”Not only is the cross itself a familiar object in the art of all nations, butthe veneration for it is an essential part of the religious life of the greaterpart of humanity. It is a common symbol among the American Indians—North,Central, and South. William W. Seymour states: “The Aztec goddess of rain bore across in her hand, and the Toltecs claimed that their deity, Quetzalcoatl,taught them the sign and ritual of the cross, hence his staff, or sceptre ofpower, resembled a crosier, and his mantle was covered with red crosses.” (TheCross in Tradition, History and Art. )The cross is also highly revered by the Japanese and Chinese. To thePythagoreans the most sacred of all numbers was the 10, the symbol of which isan X, or cross. In both the Japanese and Chinese languages the character of thenumber 10 is a cross. The Buddhist wheel of life is composed of two crossessuperimposed, and its eight points are still preserved to Christendom in thepeculiarly formed cross of the Knights Templars, which is essentiallyBuddhistic. India has preserved the cross, not only in its carvings andpaintings, but also in its architectonics; a great number of its temples—likethe churches and cathedrals of Christendom—are raised from cruciformfoundations.On the mandalas of the Tibetans, heaven is laid out in the form of a cross, witha demon king at each of the four gates. A remarkable cross of great antiquitywas discovered in the island caves of Elephanta in the harbor of Bombay. Crossesof various kinds were favorite motifs in the art of Chaldea, Phœnicia, Egypt,and Assyria. The initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries of Greece were given across which they suspended about their necks on a chain, or cord, at the time ofinitiation. To the Rosicrucians, Alchemists, and Illuminati, the cross was thesymbol of light, because each of the three letters LVX is derived from some partof the cross."},{"pageContent":"THE TAU CROSS There are three distinct forms of the cross. The first is called the TAU (morecorrectly the TAV). It closely resembles the modern letter T, consisting of ahorizontal bar resting on a vertical column, the two arms being of equal length.An oak tree cut off some feet above the ground and its upper part laid acrossthe lower in this form was the symbol of the Druid god Hu. It is suspected thatthis symbol originated among the Egyptians from the spread of the horns of abull or ram (Taurus or Aries) and the vertical line of its face. This issometimes designated as the hammer cross, because if held by its vertical baseit is not unlike a mallet or gavel. In one of the Qabbalistic Masonic legends,CHiram Abiff is given a hammer in the form of a TAU by his ancestor, Tubal-cain.The TAU cross is preserved to modern Masonry under the symbol of the T square.This appears to be the oldest form of the cross extant.241 [images/00242.jpg] THE TAU CROSS.The TAU Cross was the sign which the Lord told the people of Jerusalem to markupon their foreheads, as related by the Prophet Ezekiel. It was also placed as asymbol of liberation upon those charged with crimes but acquitted. The TAU cross was inscribed on the forehead of every person admitted into theMysteries of Mithras. When a king was initiated into the Egyptian Mysteries, theTAU was placed against his lips. It was tattooed upon the bodies of thecandidates in some of the American Indian Mysteries. To the Qabbalist, the TAUstood for heaven and the Pythagorean tetractys. The Caduceus of Hermes was anoutgrowth of the TAU cross. (See Albert Pike.)"},{"pageContent":"THE CRUX ANSATA The second type was that of a T, or TAU, cross surmounted by a circle, oftenforeshortened to the form of an upright oval. This was called by the ancientsthe Crux Ansata, or the cross of life. It was the key to the Mysteries ofantiquity and it probably gave rise to the more modern story of St. Peter’sgolden key to heaven. In the Mysteries of Egypt the candidate passed through allforms of actual imaginary dangers, holding above his head the Crux Ansata,before which the powers of darkness fell back abashed. The student is remindedof the words In hoc signo vinces. The TAU form of the cross is not unlike theseal of Venus, as Richard Payne Knight has noted. He states: “The cross in thisform is sometimes observable on coins, and several of them were found in atemple of Serapis [the Serapeum], demolished at the general destruction of thoseedifices by the Emperor Theodosius, and were said by the Christian antiquariesof that time to signify the future life.”242 [images/00243.jpg] THE CRUX ANSATA.Both the cross and the circle were phallic symbols, for the ancient worldvenerated the generative powers of Nature as being expressive of the creativeattributes of the Deity. The Crux Ansata, by combining the masculine TAU withthe feminine oval, exemplified the principles of generation. Augustus Le Plongeon, in his Sacred Mysteries Among the Mayas and Quiches, notesthat the Crux Ansata, which he calls The Key to the Nile and the Symbol ofSymbols, either in its complete form or as a simple TAU, was to be seen adorningthe breasts of statues and bas-reliefs at Palenque, Copan, and throughoutCentral America. He notes that it was always associated with water; that amongthe Babylonians it was the emblem of the water gods; among the Scandinavians, ofheaven and immortality; and among the Mayas, of rejuvenation and freedom fromphysical suffering.Concerning the association of this symbol with the waters of life, Count Gobletd’Alviella, in his Migration of Symbols, calls attention to the fact that aninstrument resembling the Crux Ansata and called the Nilometer was used by theancient Egyptians for measuring and regulating the inundations of the riverNile. It is probable that this relationship to the Nile caused it to beconsidered the symbol of life, for Egypt depended entirely upon the inundationsof this river for the irrigation necessary to insure sufficient crops. In thepapyrus scrolls the Crux Ansata is shown issuing from the mouths of Egyptiankings when they pardoned enemies, and it was buried with them to signify theimmortality of the soul. It was carried by many of the gods and goddesses andapparently signified their divine benevolence and life-giving power. The CairoMuseum contains a magnificent collection of crosses of many shapes, sizes, anddesigns, proving that they were a common symbol among the Egyptians."},{"pageContent":"THE ROMAN AND GREEK CATHOLIC CROSSES The third form of the cross is the familiar Roman or Greek type, which isclosely associated with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, although it isimprobable that the cross used resembled its more familiar modem form. There areunlimited subvari- eties of crosses, differing in the relative proportions oftheir vertical and horizontal sections. Among the secret orders of differentgenerations we find compounded crosses, such as the triple TAU in the Royal Archof Freemasonry and the double and triple crosses of both Masonic and RomanCatholic symbolism.To the Christian the cross has a twofold significance. First, it is the symbolof the death of his Redeemer, through whose martyrdom he feels that he partakesof the glory of God; secondly, it is the symbol of humility, patience, and theburden of life. It is interesting that the cross should be both a symbol of lifeand a symbol of death. Many nations deeply considered the astronomical aspect ofreligion, and it is probable that the Persians, Greeks, and Hindus looked uponthe cross as a symbol of the equinoxes and the solstices, in the belief that atcertain seasons of the year the sun was symbolically crucified upon theseimaginary celestial angles.The fact that so many nations have regarded their Savior as a personification ofthe sun globe is convincing evidence that the cross must exist as anastronomical element in pagan allegory. Augustus Le Plongeon believed that theveneration for the cross was partly due to the rising of a constellation calledthe Southern Cross, which immediately preceded the annual rains, and as thenatives of those latitudes relied wholly upon these rains to raise their crops,they viewed the cross as an annual promise of the approaching storms, which tothem meant life.There are four basic elements (according to both ancient philosophy and modemscience), and the ancients represented them by the four arms of the cross,placing at the end of each arm a mysterious Qabbalistic creature to symbolizethe power of one of these elements. Thus, they symbolized the element of earthby a bull; water by a scorpion, a serpent, or an eagle; fire by a lion; and airby a human head surrounded by wings. It is significant that the four lettersinscribed upon parchment (some say wood) and fastened to the top of the cross atthe time of the crucifixion should be the first letters of four Hebrew wordswhich stand for the four elements: “Iammin, the sea or water; Nour, fire;Rouach, the air; and lebeschah, the dry earth.” (See Morals and Dogma, by AlbertPike.)That a cross can be formed by opening or unfolding the surfaces of a cube hascaused that symbol to be associated with the earth. Though a cross within acircle has long been regarded as a sign of the planet Earth, it should really beconsidered as the symbol of the composite element earth, since it is composed ofthe four triangles of the elements. For thousands of years the cross has beenidentified with the plan of salvation for humanity The elements—salt, sulphur,mercury, and Azoth—used in making the Philosopher’s Stone in Alchemy, were oftensymbolized by a cross. The cross of the four cardinal angles also had its secretsignificance, and Masonic parties of three still go forth to the four cardinalpoints of the compass in search of the Lost Word.The material of which the cross was formed was looked upon as being an essentialelement in its symbolism. Thus, a golden cross symbolized illumination; a silvercross, purification; a cross of base metals, humiliation; a cross of wood,aspiration. The fact that among many nations it was customary to spread the armsin prayer has influenced the symbolism of the cross, which, because of itsshape, has come to be regarded as emblematic of the human body. The four majordivisions of the human structure—bones, muscles, nerves, and arteries—areconsidered to have contributed to the symbolism of the cross. This is especiallydue to the fact that the spinal nerves cross at the base of the spine, and is areminder that “Our Lord was crucified also in Egypt.”Man has four vehicles (or mediums) of expression by means of which the spiritualEgo contacts the external universe: the physical nature, the vital nature, theemotional nature, and the mental nature. Each of these partakes in principle ofone of the primary elements, and the four creatures assigned to them by theQabbalists caused the cross to be symbolic of the compound nature of man."},{"pageContent":"THE CRUCIFIXION—A COSMIC ALLEGORY Saviors unnumbered have died for the sins of man and by the hands of man, andthrough their deaths have interceded in heaven for the souls of theirexecutioners. The martyrdom of the God-Man and the redemption of the worldthrough His blood has been an essential tenet of many great religions. Nearlyall these stories can be traced to sun worship, for the glorious orb of day isthe Savior who dies annually for every creature within his universe, but yearafter year rises again victorious from the tomb of winter. Without doubt thedoctrine of the crucifixion is based upon the secret traditions of the AncientWisdom; it is a constant reminder that the divine nature of man is perpetuallycrucified upon the animal organism. Certain of the pagan Mysteries included inthe ceremony of initiation the crucifixion of the candidate upon a cross, or thelaying of his body upon a cruciform altar. It has been claimed that Apolloniusof Tyana (the Antichrist) was initiated into the Arcanum of Egypt in the GreatPyramid, where he hung upon a cross until unconscious and was then laid in thetomb (the coffer) for three days. While his body was unconscious, his soul wasthought to pass into the realms of the immortals (the place of death). After ithad vanquished death (by recognizing that life is eternal) it returned again tothe body, which then rose from the coffer, after which he was hailed as abrother by the priests, who believed that he had returned from the land of thedead. This concept was, in substance, the teaching of the Mysteries."},{"pageContent":"THE CRUCIFIED SAVIORS The list of the deathless mortals who suffered for man that he might receive theboon of eternal life is an imposing one. Among those connected historically orallegorically with a crucifixion are Prometheus, Adonis, Apollo, Atys, Bacchus,Buddha, Christna, Horus, Indra, Ixion, Mithras, Osiris, Pythagoras,Quetzalcoatl, Semiramis, and Jupiter. According to the fragramentary accountsextant, all these heroes gave their lives to the service of humanity and, withone or two exceptions, died as martyrs for the cause of human progress. In manymysterious ways the manner of their death has been designedly concealed, but itis possible that most of them were crucified upon a cross or tree. The firstfriend of man, the immortal Prometheus, was crucified on the pinnacle of MountCaucasus, and a vulture was placed over his liver to torment him throughouteternity by clawing and rending his flesh with its talons. Prometheus disobeyedthe edict of Zeus by bringing fire and immortality to man, so for man hesuffered until the coming of Hercules released him from his ages of torment.Concerning the crucifixion of the Persian Mithras, J. P. Lundy has written:“Dupuis tells us that Mithra was put to death by crucifixion, and rose again onthe 25th of March. In the Persian Mysteries the body of a young man, apparentlydead, was exhibited, which was feigned to be restored to life. By his sufferingshe was believed to have worked their salvation, and on this account he wascalled their Savior. His priests watched his tomb to the midnight of the vigilof the 25th of March, with loud cries, and in darkness; when all at once thelight burst forth from all parts, the priest cried, Rejoice, O sacred initiated,your God is risen. His death, his pains, and sufferings, have worked yoursalvation.” (See Monumental Christianity.)In some cases, as in that of the Buddha, the crucifixion mythos must be taken inan allegorical rather than a literal sense, for the manner of his death has beenrecorded by his own disciples in the Book of the Great Decease. However, themere fact that the symbolic reference to death upon a tree has been associatedwith these heroes is sufficient to prove the universality of the crucifixionstory.The East Indian equivalent of Christ is the immortal Christna, who, sitting inthe forest playing his flute, charmed the birds and beasts by his music. It issupposed that this divinely inspired Savior of humanity was crucified upon atree by his enemies, but great care has been taken to destroy any evidencepointing in that direction. Louis Jacolliot, in his book The Bible in India,thus describes the death of Christna: “Christna understood that the hour hadcome for him to quit the earth, and return to the bosom of him who had sent him.Forbidding his disciples to follow him, he went, one day, to make his ablutionson the banks of the Ganges * * *. Arriving at the sacred river, he plungedhimself three times therein, then, kneeling, and looking to heaven, he prayed,expecting death. In this position he was pierced with arrows by one of thosewhose crimes he had unveiled, and who, hearing of his journey to the Ganges,had, with a strong troop, followed with the design of assassinating him * * *.The body of the God-man was suspended to the branches of a tree by his murderer,that it might become the prey of vultures. News of the death having spread, thepeople came in a crowd conducted by Ardjouna, the dearest of the disciples ofChristna, to recover his sacred remains. But the mortal frame of the redeemerhad disappeared—no doubt it had regained the celestial abodes * * * and the treeto which it had been attached had become suddenly covered with great red flowersand diffused around it the sweetest perfume.” Other accounts of the death ofChristna declare that he was tied to a cross-shaped tree before the arrows wereaimed at him.The existence in Moor’s The Hindu Pantheon of a plate of Christna with nailwounds in his hands and feet, and a plate in Inman’s Ancient Faiths showing anOriental deity with what might well be a nail hole in one of his feet, should besufficient motive for further investigation of this subject by those of unbiasedminds. Concerning the startling discoveries which can be made along these lines,J. P. Lundy in his Monumental Christianity presents the following information:“Where did the Persians get their notion of this prophecy as thus interpretedrespecting Christ, and His saving mercy and love displayed on the cross? Both bysymbol and actual crucifix we see it on all their monuments. If it came fromIndia, how did it get there, except from the one common and original centre ofall primitive and pure religion? There is a most extraordinary plate,illustrative of the whole subject, which representation I believe to be anteriorto Christianity. It is copied from Moor’s Hindu Pantheon, not as a curiosity,but as a most singular monument of the crucifixion. I do not venture to give ita name, other than that of a crucifixion in space. * * * Can it be theVictim-Man, or the Priest and Victim both in one, of the Hindu mythology, whooffered himself a sacrifice before the worlds were? Can it be Plato’s second Godwho impressed himself on the universe in the form of the cross? Or is it hisdivine man who would be scourged, tormented, fettered, have his eyes burnt out;and lastly, having suffered all manner of evils, would be crucified? Platolearned his theology in Egypt and the East, and must have known of thecrucifixion of Krishna, Buddha, Mithra [et al]. At any rate, the religion ofIndia had its mythical crucified victim long anterior to Christianity, as a typeof the real one [Pro Deo et Ecclesia!], and I am inclined to think that we haveit in this remarkable plate.”The modern world has been misled in its attitude towards the so-called pagandeities, and has come to view them in a light entirely different from their truecharacters and meanings. The ridicule and slander heaped by Christendom uponChristna and Bacchus are excellent examples of the persecution of immortalprinciples by those who have utterly failed to sense the secret meaning of theallegories. Who was the crucified man of Greece, concerning whom vague rumorshave been afloat? Higgins thinks it was Pythagoras, the true story of whosedeath was suppressed by early Christian authors because it conflicted with theirteachings. Was it true also that the Roman legionaries carried on the field ofbattle standards upon which were crosses bearing the crucified Sun Man?"},{"pageContent":"THE CRUCIFIXION OF QUETZALCOATL One of the most remarkable of the crucified World Saviors is the CentralAmerican god of the winds, or the Sun, Quetzalcoatl, concerning whose activitiesgreat secrecy was maintained by the Indian priests of Mexico and CentralAmerica. This strange immortal, whose name means feathered snake, appears tohave come out of the sea, bringing with him a mysterious cross. On his garmentswere embellished clouds and red crosses. In his honor, great serpents carvedfrom stone were placed in different parts of Mexico.243 [images/00244.jpg] THE CRUCIFIXION OF QUETZALCOATL. (FROM THE CODEX BORGIANUS.)Lord Kingsborough writes: “May we not refer to the seventy-third page of theBorgian MS., which represents Quexalcoatl both crucified, and as it were cut inpieces for the cauldron, and with equal reason demand, whether anyone can helpthinking that the Jews of the New World [Lord Kingsborough sought to prove thatthe Mexicans were descendants of the Jews] applied to their Messiah not only allthe prophecies contained in the Old Testament relating to Christ, but likewisemany of the incidents recorded of him in the Gospels.” The cross of Quetzalcoatl became a sacred symbol among the Mayas, and accordingto available records the Maya Indian angels had crosses of various pigmentspainted on their foreheads. Similar crosses were placed over the eyes of thoseinitiated into their Mysteries. When Cortez arrived in Mexico, he brought withhim the cross. Recognizing this, the natives believed that he was Quetzalcoatlreturned, for the latter had promised to come back in the infinite future andredeem his people.In Anacalypsis, Godfrey Higgins throws some light on the cross and its symbolismin America: “The Incas had a cross of very fine marble, or beautiful jasper,highly polished, of one piece, three-fourths of an ell in length, and threefingers in width and thickness. It was kept in a sacred chamber of a palace, andheld in great veneration. The Spaniards enriched this cross with gold andjewels, and placed it in the cathedral of Cuzco. Mexican temples are in the formof a cross, and face the four cardinal points. Quexalcoatl is represented in thepaintings of the Codex Borgianus nailed to the cross. Sometimes even the twothieves are there crucified with him. In Vol. II. plate 75, the God is crucifiedin the Heavens, in a circle of nineteen figures, the number of the Metoniccycle. A serpent is depriving him of the organs of generation. In the CodexBorgianus, (pp. 4, 72, 73, 75,) the Mexican God is represented crucified andnailed to the cross, and in another place hanging to it, with a cross in hishands. And in one instance, where the figure is not merely outlined, the crossis red, the clothes are coloured, and the face and hands quite black. If thiswas the Christianity of the German Nestorius, how came he to teach that thecrucified Savior was black? The name of the God who was crucified wasQuexalcoatl.”The crucifixion of the Word in space, the crucifixion of the dove often seen inreligious symbolism—both of these are reminders of pagan overshadowing. The factthat a cross is formed by the spread wings of a bird in relation to its body isno doubt one of the reasons why the Egyptians used a bird to symbolize theimmortal nature of man, and often show it hovering over the mummified body ofthe dead and carrying in one of its claws the sign of life and in the other thesign of breath."},{"pageContent":"THE NAILS OF THE PASSION The three nails of the Passion have found their way into the symbolism of manyraces and faiths. There are many legends concerning these nails. One of these isto the effect that originally there were four nails, but one was dematerializedby a Hebrew Qabbalist and magician just as they were about to drive it throughthe foot of the Master. Hence it was necessary to cross the feet. Another legendrelates that one of the nails was hammered into a crown and that it still existsas the imperial diadem of a European house. Still another story has it that thebit on the bridle of Constantine’s horse was a Passion nail. It is improbable,however, that the nails were made of iron, for at that time it was customary touse sharpened wooden pegs. Hargrave Jennings, in his Rosicrucians, Their Ritesand Mysteries, calls attention to the fact that the mark or sign used in Englandto designate royal property and called the broad arrow is nothing more nor lessthan the three nails of the crucifixion grouped together, and that by placingthem point to point the ancient symbol of the Egyptian TAU cross is formed.In his Ancient Freemasonry, Frank C. Higgins reproduces the Masonic apron of acolossal stone figure at Quirigua, Guatemala. The central ornament of the apronis the three Passion nails, arranged exactly like the British broad arrow. Thatthree nails should be used to crucify the Christ, three murderers to kill CHiramAbiff, and three wounds to slay Prince Coh, the Mexican Indian Osiris, issignificant.C. W. King, in his Gnostics and Their Remains, thus describes a Gnostic gem:“The Gnostic Pleroma, or combination of all the Æons [is] expressed by theoutline of a man holding a scroll * * *. The left hand is formed like three bentspikes or nails; unmistakably the same symbol that Belus often holds in hisextended hand on the Babylonian cylinders, afterwards discovered by the JewishCabalists in the points of the letter Shin, and by the mediaeval mystics in theThree Nails of the Cross.” From this point Hargrave Jennings continues King’sspeculations, noting the resemblance of the nail to an obelisk, or pillar, andthat the Qabbalistic value of the Hebrew letter Shin, or Sin, is 300, namely,100 for each spike.The Passion nails are highly important symbols, especially when it is realizedthat, according to the esoteric systems of culture, there are certain secretcenters of force in the palms of the hands and in the soles of the feet.The driving of the nails and the flow of blood and water from the wounds weresymbolic of certain secret philosophic practices of the Temple. Many of theOriental deities have mysterious symbols on the hands and feet. The so-calledfootprints of Buddha are usually embellished with a magnificent sunburst at thepoint where the nail pierced the foot of Christ.In his notes on the theology of Jakob Böhme, Dr. Franz Hartmann thus sums up themystic symbolism of the crucifixion: “The cross represents terrestrial life, andthe crown of thorns the sufferings of the soul within the elementary body, butalso the victory of the spirit over the elements of darkness. The body is naked,to indicate that the candidate for immortality must divest himself of all claimsfor terrestrial things. The figure is nailed to the cross, which symbolizes thedeath and surrender of the self-will, and that it should not attempt toaccomplish anything by its own power, but merely serve as an instrument whereinthe Divine will is executed. Above the head are inscribed the letters: I. N. R.J. whose most important meaning is: In Nobis Regnat Jesus (Within ourselvesreigns Jesus). But this signification of this inscription can be practicallyknown only to those who have actually died relatively to the world of desires,and risen above the temptation for personal existence; or, to express it inother words, those who have become alive in Christ, and in whom thus the kingdomof Jesus (the holy love-will issuing from the heart of God) has beenestablished.” One of the most interesting interpretations of the crucifixionallegory is that which identifies the man Jesus with the personal consciousnessof the individual. It is this personal consciousness that conceives of anddwells in the sense of separateness, and before the aspiring soul can bereunited with the ever-present and all-pervading Father this personality must besacrificed that the Universal Consciousness may be liberated."},{"pageContent":"XLIII The Mystery of the Apocalypse The presence of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus marked that city as sacred to theMystery religion, for the Seven Wonders of the ancient world were erected toindicate the repositories of recondite knowledge. Of Ephesus, H. P. Blavatskywrites:“It was a focus of the universal ‘secret’ doctrines; the weird laboratorywhence, fashioned in elegant Grecian phraseology, sprang the quintessence ofBuddhistic, Zoroastrian, and Chaldean philosophy. Artemis, the gigantic concretesymbol of theosophico-pantheistic abstractions, the great mother Multi-mamma,androgyne and patroness of the ‘Ephesian writings,‘was conquered by Paul; butalthough the zealous converts of the apostles pretended to burn all their bookson ‘curious arts,’ τα περεργα, enough of these remained for them to study whentheir first zeal had cooled off.” (See Isis Unveiled.)Being a great center of pagan learning, Ephesus has been the locale for manyearly Christian myths. The assertion has been made that it was the last domicileof the Virgin Mary; also that the tomb of St. John the Divine was located there.According to legend, St. John did not depart from this life in the usual mannerbut, selecting his vault, entered it while still alive, and closing the entrancebehind him, vanished forever from mortal sight. A rumor was current in ancientEphesus that St. John would sleep in his tomb until the return of the Savior,and that when the apostle turned over on his. sepulchral couch the earth abovemoved like the coverlets of a bed.244 [images/00245.jpg] THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB.Before the throne of God was the crystal sea representing the Schamayim, or theliving waters which are above the heavens. Before the throne also were fourcreatures—a butt, a lion, an eagle, and a man. These represented the fourcorners of creation, and the multitude of eyes with which they were covered arethe stars of the firmament. The twenty-four elders have the same significance asthe priests gathered around the statue of Ceres in the Greater Eleusinian Riteand also the Persian Genii, or gods of the hours of the day, who, casting awaytheir crowns, glorify the Holy One. As symbolic of the divisions of time, theelders adore the timeless and enduring Spirit in the midst of them.Subjected to more criticism than any other book now incorporated in the NewTestament, the Apocalypse—popularly accredited to St. John the Divine—is by farthe most important but least understood of the Gnostic Christian writings.Though Justin Martyr declared the Book of Revelation to have been written by“John, one of Christ’s apostles,” its authorship was disputed as early as thesecond century after Christ. In the third century these contentions became acuteand even Dionysius of Alexandria and Eusebius attacked the Johannine theory,declaring that both the Book of Revelation and the Gospel according to St. Johnwere written by one Cerinthus, who borrowed the name of the great apostle thebetter to foist his own doctrines upon the Christians. Later Jerome questionedthe authorship of the Apocalypse and during the Reformation his objections wererevived by Luther and Erasmus. The once generally accepted notion that the Bookof Revelation was the actual record of a “mystical experience” occurring to St.John while that seer was an exile in the Isle of Patmos is now regarded withdis- favor by more critical scholars. Other explanations have therefore beenadvanced to account for the symbolism permeating the volume and the originalmotive for its writing. The more reasonable of these theories may be summed upas follows:First, upon the weight of evidence furnished by its own contents the Book ofRevelation may well be pronounced a pagan writing—one of the sacred books of theEleusinian or Phyrgian Mysteries. As a corollary, the real author of a worksetting forth the profundities of Egyptian and Greek mysticism must have been aninitiate himself and consequently obligated to write only in the symboliclanguage of the Mysteries.Second, it is possible that the Book of Revelation was written to reconcile theseeming discrepancies between the early Christian and pagan religiousphilosophies. When the zealots of the primitive Christian Church sought toChristianize pagandom, the pagan initiates retorted with a powerful effort topaganize Christianity. The Christians failed but the pagans succeeded. With thedecline of paganism the initiated pagan hierophants transferred their base ofoperations to the new vehicle of primitive Christianity, adopting the symbols ofthe new cult to conceal those eternal verities which are ever the pricelesspossession of the wise. The Apocalypse shows clearly the resultant fusion ofpagan and Christian symbolism and thus bears irrefutable evidence of theactivities of these initiated minds operating through early ChristianityThird, the theory has been advanced that the Book of Revelation represents theattempt made by the unscrupulous members of a certain religious order toundermine the Christian Mysteries by satirizing their philosophy. This nefariousend they hoped to attain by showing the new faith to be merely a restatement ofthe ancient pagan doctrines, by heaping ridicule upon Christianity, and by usingits own symbols toward its disparagement. For example, the star which fell toearth (Rev. viii. 10-11) could be construed to mean the Star of Bethlehem, andthe bitterness of that star (called Wormwood and which poisoned mankind) couldsignify the “false” teachings of the Christian Church. While the last theory hasgained a certain measure of popularity, the profundity of the Apocalypse leadsthe discerning reader to the inevitable conclusion that this is the leastplausible of the three hypotheses. To those able to pierce the veil of itssymbolism, the inspired source of the document requires no further corroborativeevidence.In the final analysis, true philosophy can be limited by neither creed norfaction; in fact it is incompatible with every artificial limitation of humanthought. The question of the pagan or Christian origin of the Book of Revelationis, consequently, of little importance. The intrinsic value of the book lies inits magnificent epitome of the Universal Mystery—an observation which led St.Jerome to declare that it is susceptible of seven entirely differentinterpretations. Untrained in the reaches of ancient thought, the moderntheologian cannot possibly cope with the complexities of the Apocalypse, for tohim this mystic writing is but a phantasmagoria the divine inspiration of whichhe is sorely tempted to question. In the limited space here available it ispossible to sketch but briefly a few of the salient features of the vision ofthe seer of Patmos. A careful consideration of the various pagan Mysteries willassist materially also in filling the inevitable gaps in this abridgment.In the opening chapter of the Apocalypse, St. John describes the Alpha and Omegawho stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. Surrounded by hisflaming planetary regents, this Sublime One thus epitomizes in one impressiveand mysterious figure the entire sweep of humanity’s evolutionary growth—past,present, and future.“The first stages of man’s earthly development,” writes Dr. Rudolph Steiner,“ran their course at a period when the earth was still ‘fiery’; and the firsthuman incarnations were formed out of the element of fire; at the end of hisearthly career man will himself radiate his inner being outwards creatively bythe force of the element of fire. This continuous development from the beginningto the end of the earth reveals itself to the ‘seer,’ when he sees on the astralplane the archetype of evolving man. * * * The beginning of the earthlyevolution stands forth in the fiery feet, its end in the fiery countenance, andthe complete power of the ‘creative word,’ to be finally won, is seen in thefiery source coming out of the mouth.” (See Occult Seals and Columns.)In his Restored New Testament, James Morgan Pryse traces the relationship of thevarious parts of the Alpha and Omega to the seven sacred planets of theancients. To quote:“The Logos-figure described is a composite picture of the seven sacred planets:he has the snowy-white hair of Kronos (‘Father Time’), the blazing eyes of‘wide-seeing’ Zeus, the sword of Ares, the shining face of Helios, and the chi-ton and girdle of Aphrodite; his feet are of mercury, the metal sacred toHermes, and his voice is like the murmur of the ocean’s waves (the ‘manywaters’), alluding to Selene, the Moon-Goddess of the four seasons and of thewaters.”The seven stars carried by this immense Being in his right hand are theGovernors of the world; the flaming sword issuing from his mouth is the CreativeFiat, or Word of Power, by which the illusion of material permanence is slain.Here also is represented, in all his symbolic splendor, the hierophant of thePhrygian Mysteries, his various insignia emblematic of his divine attributes.Seven priests bearing lamps are his attendants and the stars carried in his handare the seven schools of the Mysteries whose power he administers. As one bornagain out of spiritual darkness into perfect wisdom, this archimagus is made tosay: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forever more,Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.”In the second and third chapters St. John delivers to the “seven churches whichare in Asia” the injunctions received by him from the Alpha and Omega. Thechurches are here analogous to the rungs of a Mithraic ladder, and John, being“in the spirit,” ascended through the orbits of the seven sacred planets untilhe reached the inner surface of the Empyrean.“After the soul of the prophet,” writes the anonymous author of Mankind: TheirOrigin and Destiny, “in his ecstatic state has passed in its rapid flightthrough the seven spheres, from the sphere of the moon to that of Saturn, orfrom the planet which corresponds to Cancer, the gate of men, to that ofCapricorn, which is the gate of the gods, a new gate opens to him in the highestheaven, and in the zodiac, beneath which the seven planets revolve; in a word,in the firmament, or that which the ancients called crystallinum primum, or thecrystal heaven.”When related to the Eastern system of metaphysics, these churches represent thechakras, or nerve ganglia, along the human spine, the “door in heaven” being thebrahmarandra, or point in the crown of the skull (Golgotha), through which thespinal spirit fire passes to liberation. The church of Ephesus corresponds tothe muladhara, or sacral ganglion, and the other churches to the higher gangliaaccording to the order given in Revelation. Dr. Steiner discovers a relationshipbetween the seven churches and the divisions of the Aryan race. Thus, the churchof Ephesus stands for the Arch-Indian branch; the church of Smyrna, theArch-Persians; the church of Pergamos, the Chaldean-Egyptian-Semitic; the churchof Thyatira, the Grecian-Latin-Roman; the church of Sardis, theTeuton-Anglo-Saxon; the church of Philadelphia, the Slavic; and the church ofLaodicea, the Manichæan. The seven churches also signify the Greek vowels, ofwhich Alpha and Omega are the first and the last. A difference of opinion existsas to the order in which the seven planets should be related to the churches.Some proceed from the hypothesis that Saturn represents the church of Ephesus;but from the fact that this city was sacred to the moon goddess and also thatthe sphere of the moon is the first above that of the earth, the planetsobviously should ascend in their ancient order from the moon to Saturn. FromSaturn the soul would naturally ascend through the door in the Empyrean.245 [images/00246.jpg] JOHN’S VISION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM.In the upper left-hand comer is shown the destruction of Babylon, also the angelwhich cast the great millstone into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence shallthat great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all.” Belowis the horseman, called Faithful and True, casting the beast into the bottomlesspit. At the lower right is the angel with the key to the bottomless pit, whowith a great chain binds Satan for a thousand years. In the heavens above isrepresented one like unto the Son of Man, who carries a great sickle with whichhe reaps the harvests of the world. In the center is the Holy City, the NewJerusalem, with its twelve gates and the mountain of the Lamb rising in themidst thereof. From the throne of the Lamb pours the great river of crystal, orliving water, signifying the spiritual doctrine: upon all who discover and drinkof its waters is conferred immortality. Kneeling upon a high cliff, St. Johngazes down upon the mystic city, the archetype of the perfect civilization yetto be. Above the New Jerusalem, in a great sunburst of glory, is the throne ofthe Ancient One, which is the light of those who dwell in the matchless empireof the spirit. Beyond the recognition of the uninitiated world is anever-increasing aggregation composed of the spiritual elect. Though they walkthe earth as ordinary mortals, they are of a world apart and through theirceaseless efforts the kingdom of God is being slowly but surely established uponearth. These illumined souls are the builders of the New Jerusalem, and theirbodies are the living stones in its walls. Lighted by the torch of truth theycarry on their work; through their activities the golden age will return to theearth and the power of sin and death will be destroyed. For this reason the wisedeclare that virtuous and illumined men, instead of ascending to heaven, willbring heaven down and establish it in the midst of earth itself. In the fourth and fifth chapters St. John describes the throne of God upon whichsat the Holy One “which was and is, and is to come.” About the throne weretwenty-four lesser seats upon which sat twenty-four elders arrayed in whitegarments and wearing crowns of gold. “And out of the throne proceeded light-nings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burningbefore the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.” He who sat upon thethrone held in His right hand a book sealed with seven seals which no man inheaven or earth had been found worthy to open. Then appeared a Lamb (Aries, thefirst and chief of the zodiacal signs) which had been slain, having seven horns(rays) and seven eyes (lights). The Lamb took the book from the right hand ofHim that sat upon the throne and the four beasts and all the elders fell downand worshiped God and the Lamb. During the early centuries of the ChristianChurch the lamb was universally recognized as the symbol of Christ, and notuntil after the fifth synod of Constantinople (the “Quinisext Synod,” A.D. 692)was the figure of the crucified man substituted for that of Agnus Dei. Asshrewdly noted by one writer on the subject, the use of a lamb is indicative ofthe Persian origin of Christianity, for the Persians were the only people tosymbolize the first sign of the zodiac by a lamb.Because a lamb was the sin offering of the ancient pagans, the early mysticChristians considered this animal as an appropriate emblem of Christ, whom theyregarded as the sin offering of the world. The Greeks and the Egyptians highlyvenerated the lamb or ram, often placing its horns upon the foreheads of theirgods. The Scandinavian god Thor carried a hammer made from a pair of ram’shorns. The lamb is used in preference to the ram apparently because of itspurity and gentleness; also, since the Creator Himself was symbolized by Aries,His Son would consequently be the little Ram or Lamb. The lambskin apron worn bythe Freemasons over that part of the body symbolized by Typhon or Judasrepresents that purification of the generative processes which is a prerequisiteto true spirituality. In this allegory the Lamb signifies the purifiedcandidate, its seven horns representing the divisions of illuminated reason andin seven eyes the chakras, or perfected sense-perceptions.The sixth to eleventh chapters inclusive are devoted to an account of theopening of the seven seals on the book held by the Lamb. When the first seal wasbroken, there rode forth a man on a white horse wearing a crown and holding inhis hand a bow. When the second seal was broken, there rode forth a man upon ared horse and in his hand was a great sword. When the third seal was brokenthere rode forth a man upon a black horse and with a pair of balances in hishand. And when the fourth seal was broken there rode forth Death upon a palehorse and hell followed after him. The four horsemen of the Apocalypse may beinterpreted to signify the four main divisions of human life. Birth isrepresented by the rider on the white horse who comes forth conquering and toconquer; the impetuosity of youth by the rider on the red horse who took peacefrom the earth; maturity by the rider on the black horse who weighs all thingsin the scales of reason; and death by the rider on the pale horse who was givenpower over a fourth part of the earth. In the Eastern philosophy these horsemensignify the four yugas, or ages, of the world which, riding forth at theirappointed times, become for a certain span the rulers of creation.Commenting on the twenty-fourth allocution of Chrysostom, in The Origin of allReligious Worship, Dupuis notes that each of the four elements was representedby a horse bearing the name of the god “who is set over the element.” The firsthorse, signifying the fire ether, was called Jupiter and occupied the highestplace in the order of the elements. This horse was winged, very fleet, and,describing the largest circle, encompassed all the others. It shone with thepurest light, and on its body were the images of the sun, the moon, the stars,and all the bodies in the ethereal regions. The second horse, signifying theelement of air, was Juno. It was inferior to the horse of Jupiter and describeda smaller circle; in color was black but that part exposed to the sun becameluminous, thus signifying the diurnal and nocturnal conditions of air. The thirdhorse, symbolizing the element of water, was sacred to Neptune. It was of heavygait and described a very small circle. The fourth horse, signifying the staticelement of earth, described as immovable and champing its bit, was the steed ofVesta. Despite their differences in temperature, these four horses livedharmoniously together, which is in accord with the principles of thephilosophers, who declared the world to be preserved by the concord and harmonyof its elements. In time, however, the racing horse of Jupiter burned the maneof the horse of earth; the thundering steed of Neptune also became covered withsweat, which overflowed the immovable horse of Vesta and resulted in the delugeof Deucalion. At last the fiery horse of Jupiter will consume the rest, when thethree inferior elements—purified by reabsorption in the fiery ether—will comeforth renewed, constituting “a new heaven and a new earth.”When the fifth seal was opened St. John beheld those who had died for the wordof God. When the sixth seal was broken there was a great earthquake, the sunbeing darkened and the moon becoming like blood. The angels of the winds cameforth and also another angel, who sealed upon their foreheads 144,000 of thechildren of Israel that they should be preserved against the awful day oftribulation. By adding the digits together according to the Pythagorean systemof numerical philosophy, the number 144,000 is reduced to 9, the mystic symbolof man and also the number of initiation, for he who passes through the ninedegrees of the Mysteries receives the sign of the cross as emblematic of hisregeneration and liberation from the bondage of his own infernal, or inferior,nature. The addition of the three ciphers to the original sacred number 144indicates the elevation of the mystery to the third sphere.When the seventh seal was broken there was silence for the space of half anhour. Then came forth seven angels and to each was given a trumpet. When theseven angels sounded their trumpets—intoned the seven-lettered Name of theLogos—great catastrophes ensued. A star, which was called Wormwood, fell fromheaven, thereby signifying that the secret doctrine of the ancients had beengiven to men who had profaned it and caused the wisdom of God to become adestructive agency. And another star—symbolizing the false light of human reasonas distinguished from the divine reason of the initiate—fell from heaven and toit (materialistic reason) was given the key to the bottomless pit (Nature),which it opened, causing all manner of evil creatures to issue forth. And therecame also a mighty angel who was clothed in a cloud, whose face was as the sunand his feet and legs as pillars of fire, and one foot was upon the waters andthe other upon the land (the Hermetic Anthropos). This celestial being gave St.John a little book, bidding him eat it, which the seer did. The book isrepresentative of the secret doctrine—that spiritual food which is thenourishment of the spirit. And St. John, being “in the spirit,” ate his fill ofthe wisdom of God and the hunger of his soul was appeased.The twelfth chapter treats of a great wonder appearing in the heavens: a womanclothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown oftwelve stars. This woman represents the constellation of Virgo and also theEgyptian Isis, who, about to be delivered of her son Horus, is attacked byTyphon, the latter attempting to destroy the child predestined by the gods toslay the Spirit of Evil. The war in heaven relates to the destruction of theplanet Ragnarok and to the fall of the angels. The virgin can be interpreted tosignify the secret doctrine itself and her son the initiate born out of the“womb of the Mysteries.” The Spirit of Evil thus personified in the great dragonattempted to control mankind by destroying the mother of those illumined soulswho have labored unceasingly for the salvation of the world. Wings were given tothe Mysteries (the virgin) and they flew into the wilderness; and the evildragon tried to destroy them with a flood (of false doctrine) but the earth(oblivion) swallowed up the false doctrines and the Mysteries endured.The thirteenth chapter describes a great beast which rose out of the sea, havingseven heads and ten horns. Faber sees in this amphibious monster the Demiurgus,or Creator of the world, rising out of the Ocean of Chaos. While mostinterpreters of the Apocalypse consider the various beasts described therein astypical of evil agencies, this viewpoint is the inevitable result ofunfamiliarity with the ancient doctrines from which the symbolism of the book isderived. Astronomically, the great monster rising out of the Sea is theconstellation of Cetus (the whale). Because religious ascetics looked upon theuniverse itself as an evil and ensnaring fabrication, they also came to regardits very Creator as a weaver of delusions. Thus the great sea monster (theworld) and its Maker (the Demiurgus), whose strength is derived from the Dragonof Cosmic Power, came to be personified as a beast of horror and destruction,seeking to swallow up the immortal part of human nature. The Seven heads of themonster represent the seven stars (spirits) composing the constellation of theGreat Dipper, called by the Hindus Rishis, or Cosmic Creative Spirits. The tenhorns Faber relates to the ten primordial patriarchs. These may also denote theancient zodiac of ten signs.The number of the beast (666) is an interesting example of the use of Qabbalismin the New Testament and among early Christian mystics. In the following tableKircher shows that the names of Antichrist as given by Iranæus all have 666 astheir numerical equivalent.246 [images/00247.jpg] James Morgan Pryse also notes that according to this method of figuring, theGreek term φρην, which signifies the lower mind, has 666 as its numericalequivalent. It is also well known to Qabbalists that ’Iησoυς, Jesus, has for itsnumerical value another sacred and secret number—888. Adding the digits of thenumber 666 and again adding the digits of the sum gives the sacred number 9—thesymbol of man in his unregenerate state and also the path of his resurrection.The fourteenth chapter opens with the Lamb standing on Mount Zion (the easternhorizon), about Him gathered the 144,000 with the name of God written in theirforeheads. An angel thereupon announces the fall of Babylon—the city ofconfusion or worldliness. Those perish who do not overcome worldliness and enterinto the realization that spirit—and not matter—is enduring; for, having nointerests other than those which are material, they are swept to destructionwith the material world. And St. John beheld One like unto the Son of Man(Perseus) riding upon a cloud (the substances of the invisible world) andbearing in his hand a sharp sickle, and with the sickle the Shining One reapedthe earth. This is a symbol of the Initiator releasing into the sphere ofreality the higher natures of those who, symbolized by ripened grain, havereached the point of liberation. And there came another angel(Boötes)—Death—also with a sickle (Karma), who reaped the vines of the earth(those who have lived by the false light) and cast them into the winepress ofthe wrath of God (the purgatorial spheres).The fifteenth to eighteenth chapters inclusive contain an account of sevenangels (the Pleiades) who pour their vials upon the earth. The contents of theirvials (the loosened energy of the Cosmic Bull) are called the seven lastplagues. Here also is introduced a symbolic figure, termed “the harlot ofBabylon,” which is described as a woman seated upon a scarlet-colored beasthaving seven heads and ten horns. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarletand bedecked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, having in her hand a goldencup full of abominations. This figure may be an effort (probably interpolated)to vilify Cybele, or Artemis, the Great Mother goddess of antiquity Because thepagans venerated the Mater Deorum through symbols appropriate to the femininegenerative principle they were accused by the early Christians of worshiping acourtesan. As nearly all the ancient Mysteries included a test of the neophyte’smoral character, the temptress (the animal soul) is here portrayed as a pagangoddess.In the nineteenth and twentieth chapters is set forth the preparation of thatmystical sacrament called the marriage of the Lamb. The bride is the soul of theneophyte, which attains conscious immortality by uniting itself to its ownspiritual source. The heavens opened once more and St. John saw a white horse,and the rider (the illumined mind) which sat upon it was called Faithful andTrue. Out of his mouth issued a sharp sword and the armies of heaven followedafter him. Upon the plains of heaven was fought the mystic Armageddon—the lastgreat war between light and darkness. The forces of evil under the PersianAhriman battled against the forces of good under Ahura-Mazda. Evil wasvanquished and the beast and the false prophet cast into a lake of fierybrimstone. Satan was bound for a thousand years. Then followed the lastjudgment; the books were opened, including the book of life. The dead werejudged according to their works and those whose names were not in the book oflife were cast into a sea of fire. To the neophyte, Armageddon represents thelast struggle between the flesh and the spirit when, finally overcoming theworld, the illumined soul rises to union with its spiritual Self. The judgmentsignifies the weighing of the soul and was borrowed from the Mysteries ofOsiris. The rising of the dead from their graves and from the sea of illusionrepresents the consummation of the process of human regeneration. The sea offire into which those are cast who fail in the ordeal of initiation signifiesthe fiery sphere of the animal world.In the twenty-first and twenty-second chapters are pictured the new heaven andthe new earth to be established at the close of Ahriman’s reign. St. John,carried in the spirit to a great and high mountain (the brain), beheld the NewJerusalem descending as a bride adorned for her husband. The Holy Cityrepresents the regenerated and perfected world, the trued ashlar of the Mason,for the city was a perfect cube, it being written, “the length and the breadthand the height of it are equal.” The foundation of the Holy City consisted of ahundred and forty-four stones in twelve rows, from which it is evident that theNew Jerusalem represents the microcosm, patterned after the greater universe inwhich it stands. The twelve gates of this symbolic dodecahedron are the signs ofthe zodiac through which the celestial impulses descend into the inferior world;the jewels are the precious stones of the zodiacal signs; and the transparentgolden streets are the streams of spiritual light along which the initiatepasses on his path towards the sun. There is no material temple in that city,for God and the Lamb are the temple; and there is neither sun nor moon, for Godand the Lamb are the light. The glorified and spiritualized initiate is heredepicted as a city. This city will ultimately be united with the spirit of Godand absorbed into the Divine Effulgency.And St. John beheld a river, the Water of Life, which proceeded out of thethrone of the Lamb. The river represents the stream pouring from the FirstLogos, which is the life of all things and the active cause of all creation.There also was the Tree of Life (the spirit) bearing twelve manner of fruit,whose leaves were for the healing of the nations. By the tree is alsorepresented the year, which every month yields some good for the maintenance ofexisting creatures. Jesus then tells St. John that He is the root and theoffspring of David and the bright and morning star (Venus). St. John concludeswith the words, “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”"},{"pageContent":"XLIV The Faith of Islam Representative of the attitude of Christendom toward Islam, till recent years atleast, is Alexander Ross’s postscript to the Anglicized version, published in1649, of Sieur Du Ryer’s French translation of the Koran. The author of thepostscript directs the following invective against Mohammed and the Koran:“Good Reader, the great Arabian Impostor now at last after a thousand years, isby the way of France arrived in England, and his Alcoran, or gallimaufry oferrors, (a brat as deformed as the parent, and as full of heresies as his scaldhead was of scurvy) hath learned to speak English. * * * If you will take abrief view of the Alcoran, you shall find it a hodgepodge made up of these fouringredients: 1. Of Contradictions. 2. Of Blasphemy. 3. Of ridiculous Fables. 4.Of Lies.”The accusation of blasphemy is emphasized against Mohammed because he affirmedthat God, being unmarried, was incapable of having a Son! The fallacy of thisargument, however, is apparent from the Prophet’s own views of the nature of Godas contained in the second sura of the Koran:“To Allah [God] belongeth the east and the west; therefore, whithersoever yeturn yourselves to pray, there is the face of Allah; for Allah is omnipresentand omniscient. They say, Allah hath begotten children: Allah forbid! To himbelongeth whatever is in heaven, and on earth; all is possessed by him, theCreator of heaven and earth; and when he decreeth a thing, he only saith untoit, Be, and it is.” In other words, the God of Islam has but to desire and theobject of that desire at once comes into being, whereas the God of AlexanderRoss must proceed in accord with the laws of human generation!Mohammed, Prophet of Islam, “the desired of all nations,” was born in Mecca,A.D. 570 (?) and died in Medina, A.D. 632, or in the eleventh year after theHegira. Washington Irving thus describes the signs and wonders accompanying thebirth of the Prophet:247 [images/00248.jpg] MOHAMMED’S NIGHT JOURNEY TO HEAVEN.In the seventeenth sura of the Koran it is written that upon a certain nightMohammed was transported from the temple at Mecca to that of Jerusalem, but nodetails are given of the strange journey. In the Mishktu ’l-Mosabih, Mohammed ismade to describe his ascent through the seven heavens into the icy presence ofthe many-veiled God and his subsequent return to his own bed, all in a singlenight. Mohammed was awakened in the night by the Angel Gabriel, who, afterremoving the Prophet’s heart, washed the cavity with Zamzam water and filled theheart itself with faith and science. A strange creature, called Alborak, or thelightning bolt, was brought for the conveyance of the Prophet. Alborak isdescribed as a white animal of the shape and size of a mule, with the head of awoman and the tail of a peacock. According to some versions, Mohammed merelyrode Alborak to Jerusalem, where, dismounting upon Mount Moriah, he caught holdof the lower rung of a golden ladder lowered from heaven and, accompanied byGabriel, ascended through the seven spheres separating the earth from the innersurface of the empyrean. At the gate of each sphere stood one of the patriarchs,whom Mohammed saluted as he entered the various planes. At the gate of the firstheaven stood Adam; at the gate of the second, John and Jesus (sisters’ sons); atthe third, Joseph; at the fourth, Enoch; at the fifth, Aaron; at the sixth,Moses; and at the seventh, Abraham. Another order of the patriarchs and prophetsis given which places Jesus at the gate of the seventh heaven, and upon reachingthis point Mohammed is said to have requested Jesus to intercede for him beforethe throne of God. “His mother suffered none of the pangs of travail. At the moment of his cominginto the world a celestial light illumined the surrounding country, and thenewborn child, raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed: ‘God is great! There is noGod but God, and I am his prophet!’ Heaven and earth, we are assured, wereagitated at his advent. The Lake Sawa shrank back to its secret springs, leavingits borders dry; while the Tigris, bursting its bounds, overflowed theneighboring lands. The palace of Khosru the king of Persia shook on itsfoundations, and several of its towers were toppled to the earth. * * * In thesame eventful night the sacred fire of Zoroaster, which, guarded by the Magi,had burned without interruption for upward of a thousand years, was suddenlyextinguished, and all the idols in the world fell down.” (See Mahomet and HisSuccessors.)While the Prophet was still but a toddling babe, the Angel Gabriel with seventywings came to him, and cutting open the child, withdrew the heart. This Gabrielcleansed of the black drop of original sin which is in every human heart becauseof the perfidy of Adam and then returned the organ to its proper place in theProphet’s body. (See footnote in E. H. Palmer’s translation of the Qur’an.)In his youth Mohammed traveled with the Meccan caravans, on one occasion actedas armor-bearer for his uncle, and spent a considerable time among the Bedouins,from whom he learned many of the religious and philosophic traditions of ancientArabia. While traveling with his uncle, Abu Taleb, Mohammed contacted theNestorian Christians, having encamped on a certain night near one of theirmonasteries. Here the young Prophet-to-be secured much of his informationconcerning the origin and doctrines of the Christian faith.With the passing years Mohammed attained marked success in business and whenabout twenty-six years old married one of his employers, a wealthy widow nearlyfifteen years his senior. The widow, Khadijah by name, was apparently somewhatmercenary, for, finding her young business manager most efficient, she resolvedto retain him in that capacity for life! Khadijah was a woman of exceptionalmentality and to her integrity and devotion must be ascribed the early successof the Islamic cause. By his marriage Mohammed was elevated from a position ofcomparative poverty to one of great wealth and power, and so exemplary was hisconduct that he became known throughout Mecca as “the faithful and true.”Mohammed would have lived and died an honored and respected Meccan had he notunhesitatingly sacrificed both his wealth and social position in the service ofthe God whose voice he heard while meditating in the cavern on Mount Hira in themonth of Ramadan. Year after year Mohammed climbed the rocky and desolate slopesof Mount Hira (since called Jebel Nur, “the mountain of light”) and here in hisloneliness cried out to God to reveal anew the pure religion of Adam, thatspiritual doctrine lost to mankind through the dissensions of religiousfactions. Khadijah, solicitous over her husband’s ascetic practices which wereimpairing his physical health, sometimes accompanied him in his weary vigil, andwith womanly intuition sensed the travail of his soul. At last one night in hisfortieth year as he lay upon the floor of the cavern, enveloped in his cloak, agreat light burst upon him. Overcome with a sense of perfect peace andunderstanding in the blessedness of the celestial presence, he lostconsciousness. When he came to himself again the Angel Gabriel stood before him,exhibiting a silken shawl with mysterious characters traced upon it. From thesecharacters Mohammed gained the basic doctrines later embodied in the Koran. ThenGabriel spoke in a clear and wonderful voice, declaring Mohammed to be theProphet of the living God.In awe and trembling, Mohammed hastened to Khadijah, fearing the vision to havebeen inspired by the same evil spirits who served the pagan magicians so greatlydespised by him. Khadijah assured him that his own virtuous life would be hisprotection and that he need fear no evil. Thus reassured, the Prophet awaitedfurther visitations from Gabriel. When these did not come, however, such adespair filled his soul that he attempted self-destruction, only to be stoppedin the very act of casting himself over a cliff by the sudden reappearance ofGabriel, who again assured the Prophet that the revelations needed by his peoplewould be given to him as necessity arose.Possibly as a result of his lonely periods of meditation, Mohammed seemingly wassubject to ecstatic swoons. On the occasions when the various suras of the Koranwere dictated he is said to have fallen unconscious, and, regardless of thechill of the surrounding air, to have been covered with beads of perspiration.Often these attacks came without warning; at other times he would sit wrapped ina blanket to prevent a chill from the copious perspiration, and while apparentlyunconscious would dictate the various passages which a small circle of trustedfriends would either commit to memory or reduce to writing. On one occasion inlater life when Abu Bekr referred to the gray hairs in his beard, Mohammed,lifting the end of his beard and looking at it, declared its whiteness to be dueto the physical agony attendant upon his periods of inspiration.If the writings attributed to Mohammed be considered as merely thehallucinations of an epileptic—and for that reason discounted—his Christiandetractors should beware lest with the doctrines of the Prophet they alsoundermine the very teachings which they themselves affirm, for many of thedisciples, apostles, and saints of the early church are known to have beensubject to nervous disorders. Mohammed’s first convert was his own wife,Khadijah, who was followed by other members of his immediate family, acircumstance which moved Sir William Muir to note:“It is strongly corroborative of Mohammed’s sincerity that the earliest convertsto Islam were not only of upright character, but his own bosom friends andpeople of his household; who, intimately acquainted with his private life, couldnot fail otherwise to have detected those discrepancies which ever more or lessexist between the professions of the hypocritical deceiver abroad and hisactions at home.” (See The Life of Mohammad.)Among the first to accept the faith of Islam was Abu Bekr, who became Mohammed’sclosest and most faithful friend, in fact his alter ego. Abu Bekr, a man ofbrilliant attainments, contributed materially to the success of the Prophet’senterprise, and in accord with the express wish of the Prophet became the leaderof the faithful after Mohammed’s death. A’isha, the daughter of Abu Bekr, laterbecame the wife of Mohammed, thus still further cementing the bond of fraternitybetween the two men. Quietly, but industriously, Mohammed promulgated hisdoctrines among a small circle of powerful friends. When the enthusiasm of hisfollowers finally forced his hand and he publicly announced his mission, he wasalready the leader of a strong and well-organized faction. Fearing Mohammed’sgrowing prestige, the people of Mecca, waiving the time-honored tradition thatblood could not be spilt within the holy city, decided to exterminate Islam byassassinating the Prophet. All the different groups combined in this undertakingso that the guilt for the crime might thereby be more evenly distributed.Discovering the danger in time, Mohammed left his friend Ali in his bed and fledwith Abu Bekr from the city, and after adroitly eluding the Meccans, joined themain body of his followers that had preceded him to Yathrib (afterwards calledMedina). Upon this incident—called the Hegira or “flight”—is based the Islamicchronological system.Dating from the Hegira the power of the Prophet steadily grew until in theeighth year Mohammed entered Mecca after practically a bloodless victory andestablished it as the spiritual center of his faith. Planting his standard tothe north of Mecca, he rode into the city, and after circling seven times thesacred Caaba, ordered the 360 images within its precincts to be hewn down. Hethen entered the Caaba itself, cleansed it of its idolatrous associations, andrededi- cated the structure to Allah, the monotheistic God of Islam. Mohammednext granted amnesty to all his enemies for their attempts to destroy him. Underhis protection Mecca increased in power and glory, becoming the focal point of agreat annual pilgrimage, which even to this day winds across the desert in themonths of pilgrimage and numbers over threescore thousand in its train.In the tenth year after the Hegira, Mohammed led the valedictory pilgrimage andfor the last time rode at the head of the faithful along the sacred way leadingto Mecca and the Black Stone. As the premonition of death was strong upon him,he desired this pilgrimage to be the perfect model for all the thousands thatwould follow.“Conscious that life was waning away within him,” writes Washington Irving,“Mahomet, during this last sojourn in the sacred city of his faith, sought toengrave his doctrines deeply in the minds and hearts of his followers. For thispurpose he preached frequently in the Caaba from the pulpit, or in the open airfrom the back of his camel. ‘Listen to my words,’ would he say, ‘for I know notwhether, after this year, we shall ever meet here again. Oh, my hearers, I ambut a man like yourselves; the angel of death may at any time appear, and I mustobey his summons.’” While thus preaching, the very heavens are said to haveopened and the voice of God spoke, saying: “This day I have perfected yourreligion, and accomplished in you my grace.” When these words were uttered themultitude fell down in adoration and even Mohammed’s camel knelt. (See Mahometand His Successors.) Having completed the valedictory pilgrimage, Mohammedreturned to Medina.In the seventh year after the Hegira (A.H. 7) an attempt was made at Kheibar topoison the Prophet. As Mohammed took the first mouthful of the poisoned food,the evil design was revealed to him either by the taste of the meat or, as thefaithful believe, by divine intercession. He had already swallowed a smallportion of the food, however, and for the remainder of his life he sufferedalmost constantly from the effects of the poison. In A.H. 11, when his finalillness came upon him, Mohammed insisted that the subtle effects of the poisonwere the indirect cause of his approaching end. It is related that during hislast sickness he rose one night and visited a burial ground on the outskirts ofMedina, evidently believing that he, too, would soon be numbered with the dead.At this time he told an attendant that the choice had been offered him ofcontinuing his physical life or going to his Lord, and that he had chosen tomeet his Maker.Mohammed suffered greatly with his head and side and also from fever, but onJune 8th seemed convalescent. He joined his followers in prayer and, seatinghimself in the courtyard, delivered a lecture to the faithful in a clear andpowerful voice. Apparently he overtaxed his strength, for it was necessary toassist him into the house of A‘isha, which opened into the court of the mosque.Here upon a rough pallet laid on the bare floor the prophet of Islam spent hislast two hours on earth. When she saw that her aged husband was sufferingintense pain, A’isha—then but a girl of twenty—lifting the gray head of the manshe had known from infancy and who must have seemed more like a father than ahusband, supported him in her arms until the end. Feeling that death was uponhim, Mohammed prayed: “O Lord, I beseech Thee, assist me in the agonies ofdeath.” Then almost in a whisper he repeated three times: “Gabriel, come closeunto me.” (For details consult The Life of Mohammad by Sir William Muir.) In TheHero as Prophet, Thomas Carlyle writes thus of the death of Mohammed: “His lastwords were a prayer, broken ejaculations of a heart struggling-up in tremblinghope towards its Maker.”Mohammed was buried under the floor of the apartment in which he died. Thepresent condition of the grave is thus described:“Above the Hujrah is a green dome, surmounted by a large gilt crescent,springing from a series of globes. Within the building are the tombs of Muham-mad, Ab Bakr, and‘Umar, with a space reserved for the grave of our Lord JesusChrist, who Muslims say will again visit the earth, and die and be buried atal-Madnah. The grave of Ftimah, the Prophet’s daughter, is supposed to be in aseparate part of the building, although some say she was buried in Baq’. TheProphet’s body is said to be stretched full length on the right side, with theright palm supporting the right cheek, the face fronting Makkah. Close behindhim is placed Ab Bakr, whose face fronts Muhammad’s shoulder, and then ’Umar,who occupies the same position with respect to his predecessor. AmongstChristian historians there is a popular story to the effect that Muhammadansbelieved the coffin of their Prophet to be suspended in the air, which has nofoundation whatever in Muslim literature, and Niebuhr thinks the story must havearisen from the rude pictures sold to strangers.” (See A Dictionary of Islam.)Concerning the character of Mohammed there have been the grossestmisconceptions. No evidence exists to support the charges of extreme cruelty andlicentiousness laid at his door. On the other hand, the more closely the life ofMohammed is scrutinized by dispassionate investigators, the more apparent becomethe finer qualities of his nature. In the words of Carlyle:“Mahomet himself, after all that can be said about him, was not a sensual man.We so err widely if we consider this man as a common voluptuary, intent mainlyon base enjoyments—nay, on enjoyments of any kind. His household was of thefrugalest, his common diet barley bread and water. Sometimes for months therewas not a fire once lighted on his hearth. * * * A poor, hard-working,ill-provided man; careless of what vulgar man toiled for. * * * They called hima Prophet, you say? Why, he stood there face to face with them; there, notenshrined in any mystery, visibly clouting his own cloak, cobbling his ownshoes, fighting, counselling, ordering in the midst of them, they must have seenwhat kind of man he was, let him be called what you like! No emperor with histiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of his own clouting.”Confused by the apparently hopeless task of reconciling the life of the Prophetwith the absurd statements long accepted as authentic, Washington Irving weighshim in the scales of fairness.“His military triumphs awakened no pride nor vainglory, as they would have donehad they been effected for selfish purposes. In the time of his greatest power,he maintained the same simplicity of manners and appearances as in the days ofhis adversity. * * * It is this perfect abnegation of self, connected with thisapparent heart-felt piety, running throughout the various phases of his fortune,which perplex one in forming a just estimate of Mahomet’s character. * * * Whenhe hung over the death-bed of his infant son Ibrahim, resignation to the will ofGod was exhibited in his conduct under this keenest of afflictions; and the hopeof soon rejoining his child in Paradise was his consolation.” (See Mahomet andHis Successors.)A‘isha, questioned after the death of the Prophet concerning his habits, repliedthat he mended his own clothes, cobbled his own shoes, and helped her in thehousehold duties. How far removed from Western concepts of Mohammed’s sanguinarycharacter is A’isha’s simple admission that he loved most of all to sew! He alsoaccepted the invitations of slaves and sat at meals with servants, declaringhimself to be a servant. Of all vices he hated lying the most. Before his deathhe freed all his slaves. He never permitted his family to use for personal endsany of the alms or tithe money given by his people. He was fond of sweetmeatsand used rain water for drinking purposes. His time he divided into three parts,namely: the first he gave to God, the second to his family, and the third tohimself. The latter portion, however, he later sacrificed to the service of hispeople. He dressed chiefly in white but also wore red, yellow, and green.Mohammed entered Mecca wearing a black turban and bearing a black standard. Hewore only the plainest of garments, declaring that rich and conspicuous raimentdid not become the pious, and did not remove his shoes at prayer. He wasparticularly concerned with the cleanliness of his teeth and at the time of hisdeath, when too weak to speak, indicated his desire for a toothpick. Whenfearful of forgetting something, the Prophet tied a thread to his ring. He oncehad a very fine gold ring but, noting that his followers had taken to wearingsimilar rings in emulation of him, he removed his own and threw it away lest hisfollowers form an evil habit. (See The Life of Mohammad.)248 [images/00249.jpg] THE CAABA, THE HOLY PLACE OF ISLAM.The Coaba, or cube-shaped bulding in the midst of the great court of the mosqueat Mecca, is the most holy spot in the Islamic world. Toward it the followers ofthe Prophet must face five times a day at the appointed hours of prayer. Likethe devotees of nearly all other faiths, the Mussulman originally faced the Eastwhile in prayer, but by a later decree he was ordered to turn his face towardMecca.Little is known of the history of the Caaba prior to its rededication as aMohammedan mosque, other than that the building was a pagan temple. At the timethe Prophet captured Mecca, the Caaba and surrounding court contained 360 idols,which were destroyed by Mohammed before he actually gained access to the shrineitself. The “Ancient House,” as the Caaba is called, is an irregular cubemeasuring about 38 feet in length, 35 feet in height, and 30 feet in width. Thelength of each side wall varies slightly and that of the end walls over a foot.In the southeast corner of the wall at a convenient distance above the ground(about five feet) is embedded the sacred and mysterious black stone or aeroliteof Abraham. When first given to that patriarch by the Angel Gabriel this stonewas of such shining whiteness as to be visible from every part of the earth, butlater it became black because of the sins of men. This black stone, oval inshape and about seven inches in diameter, was broken in the seventh century andis now held together by a silver mounting.According to tradition, 2,000 years before the creation of the world the Caabawas first constructed in heaven, where a model of it still remains. Adam erectedthe Caaba on earth exactly below the spot in heaven occupied by the original,and selected the stones from the five sacred mountains: Sinai, al-Jud, Hir.Olivet, and Lebanon. Ten thousand angels were appointed to guard the structure.At the time of the Deluge the sacred house was destroyed, but afterward wasrebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. (For details see A Dictionary of Islam).It is probable that the site of the Caaba was originally occupied by aprehistoric stone altar or ring of uncut monoliths similar to those ofStonehenge. Like the temple at Jerusalem, the Caaba has undergone manyvicissitudes, and the present structure does not antedate the seventeenthcentury of the Christian Era. When Mecca was sacked in A.D. 930, the famousblack stone was captured by the Carmathians, in whose possession it remainedover twenty years, and it is a moot question whether the stone finally returnedby them in exchange for a princely ransom was actually the original block or asubstitute.On the north side of the Caaba are the supposed graves of Hagar and Ishmael, andnear the door (which is about seven feet above the ground) is the stone uponwhich Abraham stood white rebuilding the Caaba. Various coverings have alwaysbeen thrown over the cube-shaped structure; the present drape, which is replacedannually, is a black brocade embroidered in gold. Small pieces of the old drapeare cherished by pilgrims as holy relics.Entrance to the Caaba is effected by a movable Right of steps. The interior islined with varicolored marble, silver, and gilt. Although the building isgenerally conceived to be windowless, this point is disputed. Access to the roofis had through a silver-plated door. In addition to the sacred books the Caabacontains thirteen lamps. The great courtyard around the building contains anumber of holy objects, and is bounded by a colonnade which originally consistedof 360 pillars. Opening into the courtyard are nineteen gates, the sacred andsignificant number of the Metonic Cycle and also the number of stones in theinner ring of Stonehenge. Seven great minarets tower above the Caaba, and one ofthe sacred ceremonials in connection with the building includes sevencircumambulations about the central Caaba in an apparent effort to portray themotion of the celestial bodies. The most frequent, and apparently the most damaging, accusation brought againstMohammed is that of polygamy. Those who sincerely believe the harem to beirreconcilable with spirituality should with consistency move for theexpurgation of the Psalms of David and the Proverbs of Solomon from the list ofinspired writings, for the harem of Islam’s Prophet was insignificant comparedwith that maintained by Israel’s wisest king and the reputed favorite of theMost High! The popular conception that Mohammed taught that woman had no souland could attain heaven only through marriage is not substantiated by the wordsand attitude of the Prophet during his lifetime. In a paper entitled TheInfluence of Islam on Social Conditions, read at the World’s Parliament ofReligions held in Chicago, in 1893, Mohammed Webb states the charge and answersit thus:“It has been said that Mohammed and the Koran denied a soul to woman and rankedher with the animals. The Koran places her on a perfect and complete equalitywith man, and the Prophet’s teachings often place her in a position superior tothe male in some respects.” Mr. Webb justifies his stand by quoting from thethirty-fifth verse of the thirty-third sura of the Koran:“Verily the Moslems of either sex, and the true believers of either sex, and thedevout men, and the devout women, and the men of veracity, and the women ofveracity, and the patient men, and the patient women, and the humble men, andthe humble women, and the alms-givers of either sex, and the men who fast, andthe women who fast, and the chaste men, and the chaste women, and those ofeither sex who remember Allah frequently: for them hath Allah preparedforgiveness and a great reward.” Here the attainment of heaven is clearly setforth as a problem whose only solution is that of individual merit.On the day of his death Mohammed told Fatima, his beloved daughter, and Safiya,his aunt: “Work ye out that which shall gain acceptance for you with the Lord:for I verily have no power with Him to save you in any wise.” The Prophet didnot advise either woman to rely upon the virtues of her husband nor in anymanner did he indicate woman’s salvation to be dependent upon the human frailtyof her spouse.Everything to the contrary notwithstanding, Mohammed is not responsible for thecontradictions and inconsistencies in the Koran, for the volume was not compiledand did not assume its present form until over twenty years after his death. Inits present state the Koran is, for the major part, a jumble of hearsay throughwhich occasionally shines forth an example of true inspiration. From what isknown of the man Mohammed, it is reasonable to suppose that these nobler andfiner portions represent the actual doctrines of the Prophet; the remainder areobvious interpolations, some arising from misunderstanding and others directforgeries calculated to satisfy the temporal ambitions of conquering Islam. Onthis subject, Godfrey Higgins speaks with his usual perspicacity:“Here we have the Koran of Mohammed and the first four sincere and zealouspatriarchs, and the Koran of the conquering and magnificent Saracens—puffed upwith pride and vanity. The Koran of the eclectic philosopher was not likely tosuit the conquerors of Asia. A new one must be grafted on the old, to find ajustification for their enormities.” (See Anacalypsis.)To the discerning few it is evident that Mohammed had a knowledge of that secretdoctrine which must needs constitute the core of every great philosophical,religious, or ethical institution. Through one of four possible avenues Mohammedmay have contacted the ancient Mystery teachings: (1) through direct contactwith the Great School in the invisible world; (2) through the NestorianChristian monks; (3) through the mysterious holy man who appeared anddisappeared at frequent intervals during the period in which the suras of theKoran were revealed; (4) through a decadent school already existing in Arabia,which school in spite of its lapse into idolatry still retained the secrets ofthe Ancient Wisdom cult. The arcana of Islam may yet be demonstrated to havebeen directly founded upon the ancient pagan Mysteries performed at the Caabacenturies before the birth of the Prophet; in fact it is generally admitted thatmany of the ceremonials now embodied in the Islamic Mysteries are survivals ofpagan Arabia.The feminine principle is repeatedly emphasized in Islamic symbolism. Forexample, Friday, which is sacred to the planet Venus, is the Moslem’s holy day;green is the color of the Prophet and, being symbolic of verdure, is inevitablyassociated with the World Mother; and both the Islamic crescent and the scimitarmay be interpreted to signify the crescent shape of either the moon or Venus.“The famous ‘Stone of Cabar,’ Kaaba, Cabir, or Kebir, at Mecca,” says Jennings,“which is so devoutly kissed by the Faithful, is a Talisman. It is said that thefigure of Venus is seen to this day engraved upon it with a crescent. This veryCaaba itself was at first an idolatrous temple, where the Arabians worshippedAl-Uzza (God and Issa), that is Venus.” (See Kenealy’s Enoch, The SecondMessenger of God.)“The Mussulmans,” writes Sir William Jones, “are already a sort of heterodoxChristians: they are Christians, if Locke reasons justly, because they firmlybelieve the immaculate conception, divine character, and miracles of the MESSIAH; but they are heterodox, in denying vehemently his character of Son, and hisequality, as God, with the Father, of whose unity and attributes they entertainand express the most awful ideas; while they consider our doctrine as perfectblasphemy, and insist that our copies of the Scriptures have been corrupted bothby Jews and Christians.”The following lines are declared by the followers of the Prophet to have beendeleted from the Christian Gospels: “And when Jesus, the Son of Mary, said, Ochildren of Israel, verily I am the apostle of God sent unto you, confirming thelaw which was delivered before me, and bringing good tidings of an apostle whoshall come after me, and whose name shall be AHMED.” In the present textcontaining the prophecy of Jesus concerning a comforter to come after Him, it isfurther claimed that the word comforter should be translated illustrious andthat it had a direct reference to Mohammed; also that the tongues of flame thatdescended upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost in no way could beinterpreted as signifying the promised comforter. When asked, however, fordefinite proof that the original Gospels contained these so-called expurgatedreferences to Mohammed, the Moslems make a counter-demand for production of theoriginal documents upon which Christianity is founded. Until such writings arediscovered, the point under dispute must remain a source of controversyTo ignore the heritage of culture received from Islam would be an unpardonableoversight, for when the crescent triumphed over the cross in Southern Europe itwas the harbinger of a civilization which had no equal in its day. In Studies ina Mosque, Stanley Lane-Poole writes:“For nearly eight centuries under her Mohammedan rulers Spain set to all Europea shining example of a civilized and enlightened state. * * * Art, literatureand science prospered as they then prospered nowhere else in Europe. Studentsflocked from France and Germany and England to drink from the fountains oflearning which flowed only in the cities of the Moors. The surgeons and doctorsof Andalusia were in the van of science; women were encouraged to devotethemselves to serious study, and a lady doctor was not unknown among the peopleof Cordova. Mathematics, astronomy and botany, history, philosophy andjurisprudence, were to be mastered in Spain and in Spain alone.”The Library of Original Sources thus sums up the effects of Islam:“The results of Mohammedism have been greatly underestimated. In the centuryafter Mohammed’s death it wrested Asia Minor, Africa, and Spain fromChristianity, more than half of the civilized world, and established acivilization, the highest in the world during the Dark Ages. It brought theArabian race to their highest development, raised the position of women in theEast, though it retained polygamy, was intensively monotheistic, and until theTurks gained control for the most part encouraged progress.”In the same work, among the great Islamic scientists and philosophers who havemade substantial contributions to human knowledge are listed Gerber, or Djafer,who in the ninth century laid the foundations for modern chemistry; Ben Musa,who in the tenth century introduced the theory of algebra; Alhaze, who in theeleventh century made a profound study of optics and discovered the magnifyingpower of convex lenses; and in the eleventh century also, both Avicenna, or IbnSina, whose medical encyclopedia was the standard of his age, and the greatQabbalist Avicebron, or Ibn Gebirol.“Looking back upon the science of the Mohammedans,” resumes the authority justquoted, “it will be seen that they laid the first foundations of chemistry, andmade important advances in mathematics and optics. Their discoveries never hadthe influence they should have had upon the course of European civilization, butthis was because Europe itself was not enlightened enough to grasp and make useof them. Gerber’s observation that oxidized iron weighs heavier than beforeoxidation had to be made over again. So had some of their work in optics, andmany of their geographical discoveries. They had rounded Africa long beforeVasco da Gama. The composition of gunpowder came into Northern Europe from them.We must never forget that the dark ages in Christian Europe were the bright onesof the Mohammedan world. In the field of philosophy the Arabs started byadopting the neo-Platonism they found in Europe, and gradually working back toAristotle.”What means the subtle mystery of the phoenix reborn every six hundred years?Faintly from within the sanctuary of the World Mysteries is whispered theanswer. Six hundred years before Christ the phoenix of wisdom (Pythagoras?)spread its wings and died upon the altar of humanity, consumed by thesacrificial fire. In Nazareth the bird was again reborn from its own ashes, onlyto die upon the tree which had its roots in Adam’s skull. In A.D. 600 appearedAhmed (Mohammed). Again the phœnix suffered, this time from the poison ofKheibar, and from its charred ashes rose to spread its wings across the face ofMongolia, where in the twelfth century Genghis Khan established the rule ofwisdom. Circling the mighty desert of Gobi, the phoenix again gave up its form,which now lies buried in a glass sarcophagus under a pyramid bearing upon it theineffable figures of the Mysteries. After the lapse of six hundred years fromthe death of Genghis Khan did Napoleon Bonaparte—who believed himself to be theman of destiny—contact in his wanderings this strange legend of the continualperiodic rebirth of wisdom? Did he feel the spreading wings of the phœnix withinhimself and did he believe the hope of the world had taken flesh in him? Theeagle on his standard may well have been the phoenix. This would explain why hewas moved to believe himself predestined to establish the kingdom of Christ onearth and is, perhaps, the clue to his little-understood friendliness toward theMoslem."},{"pageContent":"XLV American Indian Symbolism The North American Indian is by nature a symbolist, a mystic, and a philosopher.Like most aboriginal peoples, his soul was en rapport with the cosmic agenciesmanifesting about him. Not only did his Manidos control creation from theirexalted seats above the clouds, but they also descended into the world of menand mingled with their red children. The gray clouds hanging over the horizonwere the smoke from the calumets of the gods, who could build fires of petrifiedwood and use a comet for a flame. The American Indian peopled the forests,rivers, and sky with myriads of superphysical and invisible beings. There arelegends of entire tribes of Indians who lived in lake bottoms; of races who werenever seen in the daytime but who, coming forth from their hidden caves, roamedthe earth at night and waylaid unwary travelers; also of Bat Indians, with humanbodies and batlike wings, who lived in gloomy forests and inaccessible cliffsand who slept hanging head downward from great branches and outcroppings ofrock. The red man’s philosophy of elemental creatures is apparently the outcomeof his intimate contact with Nature, whose inexplicable wonders become thegenerating cause of such metaphysical speculations.In common with the early Scandinavians, the Indians of North America consideredthe earth (the Great Mother) to be an intermediate plane, bounded above by aheavenly sphere (the dwelling place of the Great Spirit) and below by a dark andterrifying subterranean world (the abode of shadows and of submundane powers).Like the Chaldeans, they divided the interval between the surface of earth andheaven into various strata, one consisting of clouds, another of the paths ofthe heavenly bodies, and so on. The underworld was similarly divided and likethe Greek system represented to the initiated the House of the Lesser Mysteries.Those creatures capable of functioning in two or more elements were consideredas messengers between the spirits of these various planes. The abode of the deadwas presumed to be in a distant place: in the heavens above, the earth below,the distant corners of the world, or across wide seas. Sometimes a river flowsbetween the world of the dead and that of the living, in this respectparalleling Egyptian, Greek, and Christian theology. To the Indian the numberfour has a peculiar sanctity, presumably because the Great Spirit created Hisuniverse in a square frame. This is suggestive of the veneration accorded thetetrad by the Pythagoreans, who held it to be a fitting symbol of the Creator.The legendary narratives of the strange adventures of intrepid heroes who whilein the physical body penetrated the realms of the dead prove beyond question thepresence of Mystery cults among the North American red men. Wherever theMysteries were established they were recognized as the philosophic equivalentsof death, for those passing through the rituals experienced all after-deathconditions while still in the physical body. At the consummation of the ritualthe initiate actually gained the ability to pass in and out of his physical bodyat will. This is the philosophic foundation for the allegories of adventures inthe Indian Shadow Land, or World of Ghosts.249 [images/00250.jpg] NAVAHO SAND PAINTING.The Navaho dry or sand paintings are made by sprinkling varicolored groundpigment upon a base of smooth sand. The one here reproduced is encircled by therainbow goddess, and portrays an episode from the Navaho cosmogony myth.According to Hasteen Klah, the Navaho sand priest who designed this painting,the Navahos do not believe in idolatry; hence they make no images of their gods,but perpetuate only the mental concept of them. Just as the gods draw picturesupon the moving clouds, so the priests make paintings on the sand, and when thepurpose of the drawing has been fulfilled it is effaced by a sweep of the hand.According to this informant, the Zuni, Hopi, and Navaho nations had a commongenesis; they all came out of the earth and then separated into three nations.The Navahos first emerged about 3,000 years ago at a point now called La PlatteMountain in Colorado. The four mountains sacred to the Navahos are La PlatteMountain, Mount Taylor, Navaho Mountain, and San Francisco Mountain. While thesethree nations were under the earth four mountain ranges were below with them.The eastern mountains were white, the southern blue, the western yellow, and thenorthern black. The rise and fall of these mountains caused the alternation ofday and night. When the white mountains rose it was day under the earth; whenthe yellow ones rose, twilight; the black mountains brought night, and the blue,dawn. Seven major deities were recognized by the Navahos, but Hasteen Klah wasunable to say whether the Indians related these deities to the planets.Bakochiddy, one of these seven major gods, was white in color with light reddishhair and gray eyes. His father was the sun ray and his mother the daylight. Heascended to heaven and in some respects his life parallels that of Christ. Toavenge the kid- naping of his child, Kahothsode, a fish god, caused a greatflood to arise. To escape destruction, the Zunis, Hopis, and Navahos ascended tothe surface of the earth.The sand painting here reproduced is part of the medicine series prepared forthe healing of disease. In the healing ceremony the patient is placed upon thedrawing, which is made in a consecrated hogan, and all outsiders excluded. Thesacred swastika in the center of the drawing is perhaps the most nearlyuniversal of religious emblems and represents the four corners of the world. Thetwo hunchback gods at the right and left assume their appearance by reason ofthe great clouds borne upon their backs. In Navaho religious art, maledivinities are always shown with circular heads and female divinities withsquare heads. “From coast to coast,” writes Hartley Burr Alexander, “the sacred Calumet is theIndian’s altar, and its smoke is the proper offering to Heaven.” (See Mythologyof All Races.) In the Notes on the same work is given the following descriptionof the pipe ceremony:“The master of ceremonies, again rising to his feet, filled and lighted the pipeof peace from his own fire. Drawing three whiffs, one after the other, he blewthe first towards the zenith, the second towards the ground, and the thirdtowards the Sun. By the first act he returned thanks to the Great Spirit for thepreservation of his life during the past year, and for being permitted to bepresent at this council. By the second, he returned thanks to his Mother, theEarth, for her various productions which had ministered to his sustenance. Andby the third, he returned thanks to the Sun for his never-failing light, evershining upon all.”It was necessary for the Indian to secure the red stone for his calumet from thepipestone quarry where in some remote past the Great Spirit had come and, afterfashioning with His own hands a great pipe, had smoked it toward the fourcorners of creation and thus instituted this most sacred ceremony. Scores ofIndian tribes—some of them traveling thousands of miles—secured the sacred stonefrom this single quarry, where the mandate of the Great Spirit had decreed thateternal peace should reign.The Indian does not worship the sun; he rather regards this shining orb as anappropriate symbol of the Great and Good Spirit who forever radiates life to hisred children. In Indian symbolism the serpent—especially the GreatSerpent—corroborates other evidence pointing to the presence of the Mysteries onthe North American Continent. The flying serpent is the Atlantean token of theinitiate; the seven-headed snake represents the seven great Atlantean islands(the cities of Chibola?) and also the seven great prehistoric schools ofesoteric philosophy. Moreover, who can doubt the presence of the secret doctrinein the Americas when he gazes upon the great serpent mound in Adams County,Ohio, where the huge reptile is represented as disgorging the Egg of Existence?Many American Indian tribes are reincarnationists, some are transmigrationists.They even called their children by the names supposed to have borne by them in aformer life. There is an account of an instance where a parent by inadvertencehad given his infant the wrong name, whereupon the babe cried incessantly untilthe mistake had been rectified! The belief in reincarnation is also prevalentamong the Eskimos. Aged Eskimos not infrequently kill themselves in order toreincarnate in the family of some newly married loved one.The American Indians recognize the difference between the ghost and the actualsoul of a dead person, a knowledge restricted to initiates of the Mysteries. Incommon with the Platonists they also understood the principles of an archetypalsphere wherein exist the patterns of all forms manifesting in the earth plane.The theory of Group, or Elder, Souls having supervision over the animal speciesis also shared by them. The red man’s belief in guardian spirits would havewarmed the heart of Paracelsus. When they attain the importance of beingprotectors of entire clans or tribes, these guardians are called totems. In sometribes impressive ceremonies mark the occasion when the young men are sent outinto the forest to fast and pray and there remain until their guardian spiritmanifests to them. Whatever creature appears thereupon becomes their peculiargenius, to whom they appeal in time of trouble.The outstanding hero of North American Indian folklore is Hiawatha, a namewhich, according to Lewis Spence, signifies “he who seeks the wampum-belt.”Hiawatha enjoys the distinction of anticipating by several centuries the lateWoodrow Wilson’s cherished dream of a League of Nations. Following in thefootsteps of Schoolcraft, Longfellow confused the historical Hiawatha of theIroquois with Manabozho, a mythological hero of the Algonquins and Ojibwas.Hiawatha, a chief of the Iroquois, after many reverses and disappointments,succeeded in uniting the five great nations of the Iroquois into the “League ofthe Five Nations.” The original purpose of the league—to abolish war bysubstituting councils of arbitration—was not wholly successful, but the power ofthe “Silver Chain” conferred upon the Iroquois a solidarity attained by no otherconfederacy of North American Indians. Hiawatha, however, met the sameopposition which has confronted every great idealist, irrespective of time orrace. The shamans turned their magic against him and, according to one legend,created an evil bird which, swooping down from heaven, tore his only daughter topieces before his eyes. When Hiawatha, after accomplishing his mission, hadsailed away in his self-propelled canoe along the path of the sunset, his peoplerealized the true greatness of their benefactor and elevated him to the dignityof a demigod. In Longfellow’s Song of Hiawatha the poet has cast the greatIndian statesman in a charming setting of magic and enchantment; yet through themaze of symbol and allegory is ever faintly visible the figure of Hiawatha theinitiate—the very personification of the red man and his philosophy."},{"pageContent":"THE POPOL VUH No other sacred book sets forth so completely as the Popol Vuh the initiatoryrituals of a great school of mystical philosophy. This volume alone issufficient to establish incontestably the philosophical excellence of the redrace.“The Red ‘Children of the Sun,”’ writes James Morgan Pryse, “do not worship theOne God. For them that One God is absolutely impersonal, and all the Forcesemanated from that One God are personal. This is the exact reverse of thepopular western conception of a personal God and impersonal working forces innature. Decide for yourself which of these beliefs is the more philosophical.These Children of the Sun adore the Plumed Serpent, who is the messenger of theSun. He was the God Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, Gucumatz in Quiche; and in Peru hewas called Amaru. From the latter name comes our word America. Amaruca is,literally translated, ‘Land of the Plumed Serpent.’ The priests of this God ofPeace, from their chief centre in the Cordilleras, once ruled both Americas. Allthe Red men who have remained true to the ancient religion are still under theirsway. One of their strong centres was in Guatemala, and of their Order was theauthor of the book called Popol Vuh. In the Quiche tongue Gucumatz is the exactequivalent of Quetzalcoatl in the Nahuatl language; quet- zal, the bird ofParadise; coatl, serpent—‘the Serpent veiled in plumes of the paradise-bird’!”The Popol Vuh was discovered by Father Ximinez in the seventeenth century. Itwas translated into French by Brasseur de Bourbourg and published in 1861. Theonly complete English translation is that by Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, which ranthrough the early files of The Word magazine and which is used as the basis ofthis article. A portion of the Popol Vuh was translated into English, withextremely valuable commentaries, by James Morgan Pryse, but unfortunately histranslation was never completed. The second book of the Popol Vuh is largelydevoted to the initiatory rituals of the Quiche nation. These ceremonials are offirst importance to students of Masonic symbolism and mystical philosophy, sincethey establish beyond doubt the existence of ancient and divinely institutedMystery schools on the American Continent.Lewis Spence, in describing the Popol Vuh, gives a number of translations of thetitle of the manuscript itself. Passing over the renditions, “The Book of theMat” and “The Record of the Community,” he considers it likely that the correcttitle is “The Collection of Written Leaves,” Popol signifying the “preparedbark” and Vuh, “paper” or “book” from the verb uoch, to write. Dr. Guthrieinterprets the words Popol Vuh to mean “The Senate Book,” or “The Book of theHoly Assembly”; Brasseur de Bourbourg calls it “The Sacred Book”; and FatherXiminez designates the volume “The National Book.” In his articles on the PopolVuh appearing in the fifteenth volume of Lucifer, James Morgan Pryse,approaching the subject from the standpoint of the mystic, calls this work “TheBook of the Azure Veil.” In the Popol Vuh itself the ancient records from whichthe Christianized Indian who compiled it derived his material are referred to as“The Tale of Human Existence in the Land of Shadows, and, How Man Saw Light andLife.”The meager available native records contain abundant evidence that the latercivilizations of Central and South America were hopelessly dominated by theblack arts of their priestcrafts. In the convexities of their magnetized mirrorsthe Indian sorcerers captured the intelligences of elemental beings and, gazinginto the depths of these abominable devices, eventually made the sceptersubservient to the wand. Robed in garments of sable hue, the neophytes in theirsearch for truth were led by their sinister guides through the confusedpassageways of necromancy By the left-hand path they descended into the somberdepths of the infernal world, where they learned to endow stones with the powerof speech and to subtly ensnare the minds of men with their chants and fetishes.As typical of the perversion which prevailed, none could achieve to the greaterMysteries until a human being had suffered immola- tion at his hand and thebleeding heart of the victim had been elevated before the luring face of thestone idol fabricated by a priestcraft the members of which realized more fullythan they dared to admit the true nature of the man-made demon. The sanguinaryand indescribable rites practiced by many of the Central American Indians mayrepresent remnants of the later Atlantean perversion of the ancient sunMysteries. According to the secret tradition, it was during the later Atlanteanepoch that black magic and sorcery dominated the esoteric schools, resulting inthe bloody sacrificial rites and gruesome idolatry which ultimately overthrewthe Atlantean empire and even penetrated the Aryan religious world."},{"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIES OF XIBALBA The princes of Xibalba (so the Popol Vuh recounts) sent their four owlmessengers to Hunhun-ahpu and Vukub-hunhun-ahpu, ordering them to come at onceto the place of initiation in the fastnesses of the Guatemalan mountains.Failing in the tests imposed by the princes of Xibalba, the twobrothers—according to the ancient custom—paid with their lives for theirshortcomings. Hunhun-ahpu and Vukub-hunhun-ahpu were buried together, but thehead of Hunhun-ahpu was placed among the branches of the sacred calabash treewhich grew in the middle of the road leading to the awful Mysteries of Xibalba.Immediately the calabash tree covered itself with fruit and the head ofHunhun-ahpu “showed itself no more; for it reunited itself with the other fruitsof the calabash tree.” Now Xquiq was the virgin daughter of prince Cuchumaquiq.From her father she had learned of the marvelous calabash tree, and desiring topossess some of its fruit, she journeyed alone to the somber place where itgrew. When Xquiq put forth her hand to pick the fruit of the tree, some salivafrom the mouth of Hunhun-ahpu fell into it and the head spoke to Xquiq, saying:“This saliva and froth is my posterity which I have just given you. Now my headwill cease to speak, for it is only the head of a corpse, which has no moreflesh.”Following the admonitions of Hunhun-ahpu, the young girl returned to her home.Her father, Cuchumaquiq, later discovering that she was about to become amother, questioned her concerning the father of her child. Xquiq replied thatthe child was begotten while she was gazing upon the head of Hunhun-ahpu in thecalabash tree and that she had known no man. Cuchumaquiq, refusing to believeher story, at the instigation of the princes of Xibalba, demanded her heart inan urn. Led away by her executioners, Xquiq pleaded with them to spare her life,which they agreed to do, substituting for her heart the fruit of a certain tree(rubber) whose sap was red and of the consistency of blood. When the princes ofXibalba placed the supposed heart upon the coals of the altar to be consumed,they were all amazed by the perfume which rose therefrom, for they did not knowthat they were burning the fruit of a fragrant plant.Xquiq gave birth to twin sons, who were named Hunahpu and Xbalanque and whoselives were dedicated to avenging the deaths of Hunhun-ahpu andVukub-hunhun-ahpu. The years passed, and the two boys grew up to manhood andgreat were their deeds. Especially did they excel in a certain game calledtennis but somewhat resembling hockey. Hearing of the prowess of the youths, theprinces of Xibalba asked: “Who, then, are those who now begin again to play overour heads, and who do not scruple to shake (the earth)? Are not Hunhun-aphu andVukub-hunhun-ahpu dead, who wished to exalt themselves before our face?” So theprinces of Xibalba sent for the two youths, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, that theymight destroy them also in the seven days of the Mysteries. Before departing,the two brothers bade farewell to their grandmother, each planting in the midstof the house a cane plant, saying that as long as the cane lived she would knowthat they were alive. “O, our grandmother, O, our mother, do not weep; beholdthe sign of our word which remains with you.” Hunahpu and Xbalanque thendeparted, each with his sabarcan (blowpipe), and for many days they journeyedalong the perilous trail, descending through tortuous ravines and alongprecipitous cliffs, past strange birds and boiling springs, towards thesanctuary of Xibalba.The actual ordeals of the Xibalbian Mysteries were seven in number. As apreliminary the two adventurers crossed a river of mud and then a stream ofblood, accomplishing these difficult feats by using their sabarcans as bridges.Continuing on their way, they reached a point where four roads converged—a blackroad, a white road, a red road, and a green road. Now Hunahpu and Xbalanque knewthat their first test would consist of being able to discriminate between theprinces of Xibalba and the wooden effigies robed to resemble them; also thatthey must call each of the princes by his correct name without having been giventhe information. To secure this information, Hunahpu pulled a hair from his leg,which hair then became a strange insect called Xan; buzzing along the blackroad, the Xan entered the council chamber of the princes of Xibalba and stungthe leg of the figure nearest the door, which it discovered to be a manikin. Bythe same artifice the second figure was proved to be of wood, but upon stingingthe third, there was an immediate response. By stinging each of the twelveassembled princes in turn the insect thus discovered each one’s name, for theprinces called each other by name in discussing the cause of the mysteriousbites. Having secured the desired information in this novel manner, the insectthen flew back to Hunahpu and Xbalanque, who thus fortified, fearlesslyapproached the threshold of Xibalba and presented themselves to the twelveassembled princes.When told to adore the king, Hunahpu and Xbalanque laughed, for they knew thatthe figure pointed out to them was the lifeless manikin. The young adventurersthereupon addressed the twelve princes by name thus: “Hail, Hun-came; hail,Vukub-came; hail, Xiquiripat; hail, Cuchumaquiq; hail, Ahalpuh; hail, Ahalcana;hail, Chamiabak; hail, Chamiaholom; hail, Quiqxic; hail, Patan; hail Quiqre;hail, Quiqrixqaq.” When invited by the Xibalbians to seat themselves upon agreat stone bench, Hunahpu and Xbalanque declined to do so, declaring that theywell knew the stone to be heated so that they would be burned to death if theysat upon it. The princes of Xibalba then ordered Hunahpu and Xbalanque to restfor the night in the House of the Shadows. This completed the first degree ofthe Xibalbian Mysteries.250 [images/00251.jpg] MIDEWIWIN RECORD ON BIRCH BARK.The birch-bark roll is one of the most sacred possessions of an initiate of theMidewiwin, or Grand Medicine Society, of the Ojibwas. Concerning these rolls,Colonel Garrick Mattery writes: “To persons acquainted with secret societies, agood comparison for the Midewiwin charts would be what is called a trestleboardof a Masonic order, which is printed and published and publicly exposed withoutexhibiting any secrets of the order; yet it is not only significant, but usefulto the esoteric in assistance to their memory as to the details of ceremony.”A most complete and trustworthy account of the Midewiwin is that given by W. J.Hoffman in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. He writes: TheMidewiwin—Society of the Mide or Shamans—consists of an indefinite number ofMide of both sexes. The society is graded into four separate and distinctdegrees, although there is a general impression prevailing even among certainmembers that any degree beyond the first is practically a mere repetition. Thegreater power attained by one in making advancement depends upon the fact of hishaving submitted to “being shot at with the medicine sacks’ in the hands of theofficiating priests.*** It has always been customary for the Mide priests topreserve birch-bark records, bearing delicate incised lines to representpictorially the ground plan of the number of degrees to which the owner isentitled. Such records or charts are sacred and are never exposed to the publicview.”The two rectangular diagrams represent two degrees of the Mide lodge and thestraight line through the center the spiritual path, or ‘straight and narrowway,’ running through the degrees. The lines running tangent to the central pathsignify temptations, and the faces at the termini of the lines are manidos, orpowerful spirits. Writing of the Midewiwin, Schoolcraft, the great authority onthe American Indian, says: “In the society of the Midewiwin the object is toteach the higher doctrines of spiritual existence, its nature and mode ofexistence, and the influence it exercises among men. It is an association of menwho profess the highest knowledge known to the tribes.”According to legend, Manabozho, the Great Rabbit, who was a servant of DzheMonido, the Good Spirit, gazing down upon the progenitors of the Ojibwas andperceiving them to be without spiritual knowledge, instructed an otter in themysteries of Midewiwin. Manabozho built a Midewigan and initiated the otter,shooting the sacred Migis (a small shell, the sacred symbol of the Mide) intothe body of the otter. He then conferred immortality upon the animal, andentrusted to it the secrets of the Grand Medicine Society. The ceremony ofinitiation is preceded by sweat baths and consists chiefly of overcoming theinfluences of evil manidos. The initiate is also instructed in the art ofhealing and (judging from Plate III of Mr. Hoffman’s article) a knowledge ofdirectionalizing the forces moving through the vital centers of the human body.Though the cross is an important symbol in the Midewiwin rites, it is noteworthythat the Mide priests steadfastly refused to give up their religion and beconverted to Christianity. The second trial was given in the House of Shadows, where to each of thecandidates was brought a pine torch and a cigar, with the injunction that bothmust be kept alight throughout the entire night and yet each must be returnedthe next morning unconsumed. Knowing that death was the alternative to failurein the test, the young men burnt aras-feathers in place of the pine splinters(which they closely resemble) and also put fireflies on the tips of the cigars.Seeing the lights, those who watched felt certain that Hunahpu and Xbalanque hadfallen into the trap, but when morning came the torches and cigars were returnedto the guards unconsumed and still burning. In amazement and awe, the princes ofXibalba gazed upon the unconsumed splinters and cigars, for never before hadthese been returned intact.The third ordeal took place presumably in a cavern called the House of Spears.Here hour after hour the youths were forced to defend themselves against thestrongest and most skillful warriors armed with spears. Hunahpu and Xbalanquepacified the spearmen, who thereupon ceased attacking them. They then turnedtheir attention to the second and most difficult part of the test: theproduction of four vases of the rarest flowers but which they were not permittedto leave the temple to gather. Unable to pass the guards, the two young mensecured the assistance of the ants. These tiny creatures, crawling into thegardens of the temple, brought back the blossoms so that by morning the vaseswere filled. When Hunahpu and Xbalanque presented the flowers to the twelveprinces, the latter, in amazement, recognized the blossoms as having beenfilched from their own private gardens. In consternation, the princes of Xibalbathen counseled together how they could destroy the intrepid neophytes andforthwith prepared for them the next ordeal.For their fourth test, the two brothers were made to enter the House of Cold,where they remained for an entire night. The princes of Xibalba considered thechill of the icy cavern to be unbearable and it is described as “the abode ofthe frozen winds of the North.” Hunahpu and Xbalanque, however, protectedthemselves from the deadening influence of the frozen air by building fires ofpine cones, whose warmth caused the spirit of cold to leave the cavern so thatthe youths were not dead but full of life when day dawned. Even greater thanbefore was the amazement of the princes of Xibalba when Hunahpu and Xbalanqueagain entered the Hall of Assembly in the custody of their guardians.The fifth ordeal was also of a nocturnal nature. Hunahpu and Xbalanque wereushered into a great chamber which was immediately filled with ferocious tigers.Here they were forced to remain throughout the night. The young men tossed bonesto the tigers, which they ground to pieces with their strong jaws. Gazing intothe House of the Tigers, the princes of Xibalba beheld the animals chewing thebones and said one to the other: “They have at last learned (to know the powerof Xibalba), and they have given themselves up to the beasts.” But when at dawnHunahpu and Xbalanque emerged from the House of the Tigers unharmed, theXibalbians cried: “Of what race are those?” for they could not understand howany man could escape the tigers’ fury. Then the princes of Xibalba prepared forthe two brothers a new ordeal.The sixth test consisted of remaining from sunset to sunrise in the House ofFire. Hunahpu and Xbalanque entered a large apartment arranged like a furnace.On every side the flames arose and the air was stifling; so great was the heatthat those who entered this chamber could survive only a few moments. But atsunrise when the doors of the furnace were opened, Hunahpu and Xbalanque cameforth unscorched by the fury of the flames. The princes of Xibalba, perceivinghow the two intrepid youths had survived every ordeal prepared for theirdestruction, were filled with fear lest all the secrets of Xibalba should fallinto the hands of Hunahpu and Xbalanque. So they prepared the last ordeal, anordeal yet more terrible than any which had gone before, certain that the youthscould not withstand this crucial test.The seventh ordeal took place in the House of the Bats. Here in a darksubterranean labyrinth lurked many strange and odious creatures of destruction.Huge bats fluttered dismally through the corridors and hung with folded wingsfrom the carvings on the walls and ceilings. Here also dwelt Camazotz, the Godof Bats, a hideous monster with the body of a man and the wings and head of abat. Camazotz carried a great sword and, soaring through the gloom, decapitatedwith a single sweep of his blade any unwary wanderers seeking to find their waythrough the terror-filled chambers. Xbalanque passed successfully through thishorrifying test, but Hunahpu, caught off his guard, was beheaded by Camazotz.Later, Hunahpu was restored to life by magic, and the two brothers, having thusfoiled every attempt against their lives by the Xibalbians, in order to betteravenge the murder of Hunhun-ahpu and Vukub-hunhun-ahpu, permitted themselves tobe burned upon a funeral pyre. Their powdered bones were then cast into a riverand immediately became two great man-fishes. Later taking upon themselves theforms of aged wanderers, they danced for the Xibalbians and wrought strangemiracles. Thus one would cut the other to pieces and with a single wordresurrect him, or they would burn houses by magic and then instantly rebuildthem. The fame of the two dancers—who were in reality Hunahpu andXbalanque—finally came to the notice of the twelve princes of Xibalba, whothereupon desired these two miracle-workers to perform their strange featsbefore them. After Hunahpu and Xbalanque had slain the dog of the princes andrestored it to life, had burned the royal palace and instantly rebuilt it, andgiven other demonstrations of their magical powers, the monarch of theXibalbians asked the magicians to destroy him and restore him also to life. SoHunahpu and Xbalanque slew the princes of Xibalba but did not return them tolife, thereby avenging the murder of Hunhun-ahpu and Vukub-hunhun-ahpu. Theseheroes later ascended to heaven, where they became the celestial lights."},{"pageContent":"KEYS TO THE MYSTERIES OF XIBALBA “Do not these initiations,” writes Le Plongeon, “vividly recall to mind whatHenoch said he saw in his visions? That blazing house of crystal, burning hotand icy cold—that place where were the bow of fire, the quiver of arrows, thesword of fire—that other where he had to cross the babbling stream, and theriver of fire—and those extremities of the Earth full of all kinds of hugebeasts and birds—or the habitation where appeared one of great glory sittingupon the orb of the sun—and, lastly, does not the tamarind tree in the midst ofthe earth, that he was told was the Tree of Knowledge, find its simile in thecalabash tree, in the middle of the road where those of Xibalba placed the headof Hunhun Ahpu, after sacrificing him for having failed to support the firsttrial of the initiation? * * * These were the awful ordeals that the candidatesfor initiation into the sacred mysteries had to pass through in Xibalba. Do theynot seem an exact counterpart of what happened in a milder form at theinitiation into the Eleusinian mysteries? and also the greater mysteries ofEgypt, from which these were copied? Does not the recital of what the candidatesto the mysteries in Xibalba were required to know, before being admitted, * * *recall to mind the wonderful similar feats said to be performed by the Mahatmas,the Brothers in India, and of several of the passages of the book of Daniel, whohad been initiated to the mysteries of the Chaldeans or Magi which, according toEubulus, were divided into three classes or genera, the highest being the mostlearned?” (See Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and the Quiches.)In his introductory notes to the Popol Vuh, Dr. Guthrie presents a number ofimportant parallelisms between this sacred book of the Quichés and the sacredwritings of other great civilizations. In the tests through which Hunahpu andXbalanque are forced to pass he finds the following analogy with the signs ofthe zodiac as employed in the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks:“Aries, crossing the river of mud. Taurus, crossing the river of blood. Gemini,detecting the two dummy kings. Cancer, the House of Darkness. Leo, the House ofSpears. Virgo, the House of Cold (the usual trip to Hell). Libra, the House ofTigers (feline poise). Scorpio, the House of Fire. Sagittarius, the House ofBats, where the God Camazotz decapitates one of the heroes. Capricorn, theburning on the scaffold (the dual Phoenix). Aquarius, their ashes beingscattered in a river. Pisces their ashes turning into man-fishes, and later backinto human form.”It would seem more appropriate to assign the river of blood to Aries and that ofmud to Taurus, and it is not at all improbable that in the ancient form of thelegend the order of the rivers was reversed. Dr. Guthrie’s most astonishingconclusion is his effort to identify Xibalba with the ancient continent ofAtlantis. He sees in the twelve princes of Xibalba the rulers of the Atlanteanempire, and in the destruction of these princes by the magic of Hunahpu andXbalanque an allegorical depiction of the tragic end of Atlantis. To theinitiated, however, it is evident that Atlantis is simply a symbolic figure inwhich is set forth the mystery of origins.Concerned primarily with the problems of mystical anatomy, Mr. Pryse relates thevarious symbols described in the Popol Vuh to the occult centers ofconsciousness in the human body. Accordingly, he sees in the elastic ball thepineal gland and in Hunahpu and Xbalanque the dual electric current directedalong the spinal column. Unfortunately, Mr. Pryse did not translate that portionof the Popol Vuh dealing directly with the initiatory ceremonial. Xibalba heconsiders to be the shadowy or etheric sphere which, according to the Mysteryteachings, was located within the body of the planet itself. The fourth book ofthe Popol Vuh concludes with an account of the erection of a majestic temple,all white, where was preserved a secret black divining stone, cubical in shape.Gucumatz (or Quetzalcoatl) partakes of many of the attributes of King Solomon:the account of the temple building in the Popol Vuh is a reminder of the storyof Solomon’s Temple, and undoubtedly has a similar significance. Brasseur deBourbourg was first attracted to the study of religious parallelisms in thePopol Vuh by the fact that the temple, together with the black stone which itcontained, was named the Caabaha, a name astonishingly similar to that of theTemple, or Caaba, which contains the sacred black stone of Islam.The exploits of Hunahpu and Xbalanque take place before the actual creation ofthe human race and therefore are to be considered essentially as spiritualmysteries. Xibalba doubtless signifies the inferior universe of Chaldean andPythagorean philosophy; the princes of Xibalba are the twelve Governors of thelower universe; and the two dummies or manikins in their midst may beinterpreted as the two false signs of the ancient zodiac inserted in the heavensto make the astronomical Mysteries incomprehensible to the profane. The descentof Hunahpu and Xbalanque into the subterranean kingdom of Xibalba by crossingover the rivers on bridges made from their blowguns has a subtle analogy to thedescent of the spiritual nature of man into the physical body through certainsuperphysical channels that may be likened to the blowguns or tubes. Thesabarcan is also an appropriate emblem of the spinal cord and the power residentwithin its tiny central opening. The two youths are invited to play the “Game ofLife” with the Gods of Death, and only with the aid of supernatural powerimparted to them by the “Sages” can they triumph over these gloomy lords. Thetests represent the soul wandering through the sub-zodiacal realms of thecreated universe; their final victory over the Lords of Death represents theascension of the spiritual and illumined consciousness from the lower naturewhich has been wholly consumed by the fire of spiritual purification.That the Quichés possessed the keys to the mystery of regeneration is evidentfrom an analysis of the symbols appearing upon the images of their priests andgods. In Vol. II of the Anales del Museo Nacional de Mexico is reproduced thehead of an image generally considered to represent Quetzalcoatl. The sculpturingis distinctly Oriental in character and on the crown of the head appear both thethousand-petaled sunburst of spiritual illumination and the serpent of theliberated spinal fire. The Hindu chakra is unmistakable and it frequentlyappears in the religious art of the three Americas. One of the carved monolithsof Central America is adorned with the heads of two elephants with theirdrivers. No such animals have existed in the Western Hemisphere sinceprehistoric times and it is evident that the carvings are the result of contactwith the distant continent of Asia. Among the Mysteries of the Central AmericanIndians is a remarkable doctrine concerning the consecrated mantles or, as theywere called in Europe, magic capes. Because their glory was fatal to mortalvision, the gods, when appearing to the initiated priests, robed themselves inthese mantles. Allegory and fable likewise are the mantles with which the secretdoctrine is ever enveloped. Such a magic cape of concealment is the Popol Vuh,and deep within its folds sits the god of Quiche philosophy. The massivepyramids, temples, and monoliths of Central America may be likened also to thefeet of gods, whose upper parts are enshrouded in magic mantles of invisibility."},{"pageContent":"XLVI The Mysteries and Their Emissaries Did that divine knowledge which constituted the supreme possession of the paganpriestcrafts survive the destruction of their temples? Is it yet accessible tomankind, or does it lie buried beneath the rubbish of ages, entombed within thevery sanctuaries that were once illuminated by its splendor? “In Egypt,” writesOrigen, “the philosophers have a sublime and secret knowledge respecting thenature of God.” What did Julian imply when he spoke of the secret initiationsinto the sacred Mysteries of the Seven-Rayed God who lifted souls to salvationthrough His own nature? Who were the blessed theurgists who understood theseprofundities concerning which Julian dared not speak? If this inner doctrinewere always concealed from the masses, for whom a simpler code had been devised,is it not highly probable that the exponents of every aspect of moderncivilization—philosophic, ethical, religious, and scientific—are ignorant of thetrue meaning of the very theories and tenets on which their beliefs are founded?Do the arts and sciences that the race has inherited from older nations concealbeneath their fair exterior a mystery so great that only the most illuminedintellect can grasp its import? Such is undoubtedly the case.Albert Pike, who has gathered ample evidence of the excellence of the doctrinespromulgated by the Mysteries, supports his assertions by quoting from thewritings of Clement of Alexandria, Plato, Epictetus, Proclus, Aristophanes, andCicero, all of whom unite in lauding the high ideals of these institutions. Fromthe unqualified testimony of such reputable authorities no reasonable doubt canexist that the initiates of Greece, Egypt, and other ancient countries possessedthe correct solution to those great cultural, intellectual, moral, and socialproblems which in an unsolved state confront the humanity of the twenti-ethcentury. The reader must not interpret this statement to mean that antiquity hadforeseen and analyzed every complexity of this generation, but rather that theMysteries had evolved a method whereby the mind was so trained in thefundamental verities of life that it was able to cope intelligently with anyemergency which might arise. Thus the reasoning faculties were organized by asimple process of mental culture, for it was asserted that where reason reignssupreme, inconsistency cannot exist. Wisdom, it was maintained, lifts man to thecondition of Godhood, a fact which explains the enigmatical statement that theMysteries transformed “roaring beasts into divinities.”251 [images/00252.jpg] THE TABLE OF CEBES.There is a legend to the effect that the Tablet of Cebes, a dialogue betweenCebes and Gerundio, was based upon an ancient table set up in the Temple ofKronos at Athens or Thebes, which depicted the entire progress of human life.The author of the Tablet of Cebes was a disciple of Socrates and lived about 390B.C. The world is represented as a great mountain. Out of the earth at the baseof it come the myriads of human creatures who climb upward in search of truthand immortality. Above the clouds which conceal the summit of the mountain isthe goal of human attainment—true happiness. The figures and groups are arrangedas follows: (1) the door of the wall of life; (2) the Genius or Intelligence;(3) deceit; (4) opinions, desires, and pleasures; (5) fortune; (6) the strong;(7) incontinence, venery, insatiability, flattery; (8) sorrow; (9) sadness; (10)misery; (11) grief; (12) rage or despair; (13) the house of misfortune; (14)penitence; (15) true opinion; (16) false opinion; (17) false doctrine; (18)poets, orators, geometers, et al.; (19) incontinence, sexual indulgence, andopinion; (20) the road of the true doctrine; (21) continence and patience; (22)the true doctrine; (23) truth and persuasion; (24) science and the virtues; (25)happiness; (26) the highest (first) pleasure of the wise man; (27) the lazy andthe strays. The preeminence of any philosophical system can be determined only by theexcellence of its products. The Mysteries have demonstrated the superiority oftheir culture by giving to the world minds of such overwhelming greatness, soulsof such beatific vision, and lives of such outstanding impeccability that evenafter the lapse of ages the teachings of these individuals constitute thepresent spiritual, intellectual, and ethical standards of the race. Theinitiates of the various Mystery schools of past ages form a veritable goldenchain of supermen and superwomen connecting heaven and earth. They are the linksof that Homeric “golden chain” with which Zeus boasted he could bind the severalparts of the universe to the pinnacle of Olympus. The sons and daughters of Isisare indeed an illustrious line—founders of sciences and philosophies, patrons ofarts and crafts, supporting by the transcendency of their divinely given powerthe structures of world religions erected to do them homage. Founders ofdoctrines which have molded the lives of uncounted generations, theseInitiate-Teachers bear witness to that spiritual culture which has alwaysexisted—and always will exist—as a divine institution in the world of men.Those who represent an ideal beyond the comprehension of the masses must facethe persecution of the unthinking multitude who are without that divine idealismwhich inspires progress and those rational faculties which unerringly sift truthfrom falsehood. The lot of the Initiate-Teacher is therefore almost invariablyan unhappy one. Pythagoras, crucified and his university burned; Hypatia, tornfrom her chariot and rended limb from limb; Jacques de Molay, whose memorysurvives the consuming flame; Savonarola, burned in the square of Florence;Galileo, forced to recant upon bended knee; Giordano Bruno, burned by theInquisition; Roger Bacon, compelled to carry on his experiments in the secrecyof his cell and leave his knowledge hidden under cipher; Dante Alighieri, dyingin exile from his beloved city; Francis Bacon, patient under the burden ofpersecution; Cagliostro, the most vilified man of modern times—all thisillustrious line bear unending witness of man’s inhumanity to man. The world hasever been prone to heap plaudits upon its fools and calumny upon its thinkers.Here and there notable exceptions occur, as in the case of the Comte deSt.-Germain, a philosopher who survived his inquisitors and through the sheertranscendency of his genius won a position of comparative immunity. But even theillustrious Comte—whose illumined intellect merited the homage of theworld—could not escape being branded an impostor, a charlatan, and anadventurer. From this long list of immortal men and women who have representedthe Ancient Wisdom before the world, three have been chosen as outstandingexamples for more detailed consideration: the first the most eminent womanphilosopher of all ages; the second the more maligned and persecuted man sincethe beginning of Christian Era; the third the most brilliant and the mostsuccessful modern exponent of this Ancient Wisdom."},{"pageContent":"HYPATIA Sitting in the chair of philosophy previously occupied by her father, Theon themathematician, the immortal Hypatia was for many years the central figure in theAlexandrian School of Neo-Platonism. Famed alike for the depth of her learningand the charm of her person, beloved by the citizens of Alexandria, andfrequently consulted by the magistrates of that city, this noble woman standsout from the pages of history as the greatest of the pagan martyrs. A personaldisciple of the magician Plutarch, and versed in the profundities of thePlatonic School, Hypatia eclipsed in argument and public esteem every proponentof the Christian doctrines in Northern Egypt. While her writings perished at thetime of the burning of the library of Alexandria by the Mohammedans, some hintof their nature may be gleaned from the statements of contemporaneous authors.Hypatia evidently wrote a commentary on the Arithmetic of Diophantus, another onthe Astronomical Canon of Ptolemy, and a third on the Conics of Apollonius ofPerga. Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, her devoted friend, wrote to Hypatia forassistance in the construction of an astrolabe and a hydroscope. Recognizing thetranscendency of her intellect, the learned of many nations flocked to theacademy where she lectured.A number of writers have credited the teachings of Hypatia with being Christianin spirit; in fact she removed the veil of mystery in which the new cult hadenshrouded itself, discoursing with such clarity upon its most involvedprinciples that many newly converted to the Christian faith deserted it tobecome her disciples. Hypatia not only proved conclusively the pagan origin ofthe Christian faith but also exposed the purported miracles then advanced by theChristians as tokens of divine preference by demonstrating the natural lawscontrolling the phenomena.At this time Cyril—later to be renowned as the founder of the doctrine of theChristian Trinity and canonized for his zeal—was Bishop of Alexandria. Seeing inHypatia a continual menace to the promulgation of the Christian faith,Cyril—indirectly at least—was the cause of her tragic end. Despite every latereffort to exonerate him from the stigma of her murder, the incontrovertible factremains that he made no effort to avert the foul and brutal crime. The onlyshred of excuse which might be offered in his defense is that, blinded by thespell of fanaticism, Cyril considered Hypatia to be a sorceress in league withthe Devil. In contrast to the otherwise general excellence of the literary worksof Charles Kingsley may be noted his puerile delineation of the character ofHypatia in his book by that name. Without exception, the meager historicalreferences to this virgin philosopher attest her virtue, integrity, and absolutedevotion to the principles of Truth and Right.While it is true that the best minds of the Christianity of that period mayreadily be absolved from the charge of participes criminis, the implacablehatred of Cyril unquestionably communicated itself to the more fanatical membersof his faith, particularly to a group of monks from the Nitrian desert. Led byPeter the Reader, a savage and illiterate man, they attacked Hypatia on the openstreet as she was passing from the academy to her home. Dragging the defenselesswoman from her chariot, they took her to the Cæsarean Church. Tearing away hergarments, they pounded her to death with clubs, after which they scraped theflesh from her bones with oyster shells and carried the mutilated remains to aplace called Cindron, where they burned them to ashes.Thus perished in A.D. 415 the greatest woman initiate of the ancient world, andwith her fell also the Neo-Platonic School of Alexandria. The memory of Hypatiahas probably been perpetuated in the hagiolatry of the Roman Catholic Church inthe person of St. Catherine of Alexandria."},{"pageContent":"THE COMTE DI CAGLIOSTRO The “divine” Cagliostro, one moment the idol of Paris, the next a lonelyprisoner in a dungeon of the Inquisition, passed like a meteor across the faceof France. According to his memoirs written by him during his confinement in theBastille, Alessandro Cagliostro was born in Malta of a noble but unknown family.He was reared and educated in Arabia under the tutelage of Altotas, a man wellversed in several branches of philosophy and science and also a master of thetranscendental arts. While Cagliostro’s biographers generally ridicule thisaccount, they utterly fail to advance in its stead any logical solution for thesource of his magnificent store of arcane knowledge.Branded as an impostor and a charlatan, his miracles declared to be legerdemain,and his very generosity suspected of an ulterior motive, the Comte di Cagliostrois undoubtedly the most calumniated man in modern history. “The mistrust,”writes W.H.K. Trowbridge, “that mystery and magic always inspire made Cagliostrowith his fantastic personality an easy target for calumny. After having beenriddled with abuse till he was unrecognizable, prejudice, the foster child ofcalumny, proceeded to lynch him, so to speak. For over one hundred years hischaracter has dangled on the gibbet of infamy, upon which the sbirri oftradition have inscribed a curse on any one who shall attempt to cut him down.His fate has been his fame. He is remembered in history, not so much foranything he did, as for what was done to him.” (See Cagliostro, the Splendourand Misery of a Master of Magic.)According to popular belief Cagliostro’s real name was Giuseppe Balsamo, and hewas a Sicilian by birth. Within recent years, however, doubts have arisen as towhether this belief is in accord with the facts. It may yet be proved that inpart, at least, the tirades of abuse heaped upon the unfortunate Comte have beendirected against the wrong man. Giuseppe Balsamo was born in 1743 of honest buthumble parentage. From boyhood he exhibited selfish, worthless, and evencriminal tendencies, and after a series of escapades disappeared. Trowbridge(loc. cit.) presents ample proof that Cagliostro was not Giuseppe Balsamo, thusdisposing of the worst accusation against him. After six months’ imprisonment inthe Bastille, on his trial Cagliostro was exonerated from any implication in thetheft of the famous “Queen’s Necklace,” and later the fact was established thathe had actually warned Cardinal de Rohan of the intended crime. Despite thefact, however, that he was discharged as innocent by the French trial court, adeliberate effort to vilify Cagliostro was made by an artist—more talented thanintelligent—who painted a picture showing him holding the fatal necklace in hishand. The trial of Cagliostro has been called the prologue of the FrenchRevolution. The smoldering animosity against Marie Antoinette and Louis XVIengendered by this trial later burst forth as the holocaust of the Reign ofTerror. In his brochure, Cagliostro and His Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, HenryR. Evans also ably defends this much persecuted man against the infamies sounjustly linked with his name.Sincere investigators of the facts surrounding the life and mysterious “death”of Cagliostro are of the opinion that the stories circulated against him may betraced to the machinations of the Inquisition, which in this manner sought tojustify his persecution. The basic charge against Cagliostro was that he hadattempted to found a Masonic lodge in Rome—nothing more. All other accusationsare of subsequent date. For some reason undisclosed, the Pope commutedCagliostro’s sentence of death to perpetual imprisonment. This act in itselfshowed the regard in which Cagliostro was held even by his enemies. While hisdeath is believed to have occurred several years later in an Inquisitionaldungeon in the castle of San Leo, it is highly improbable that such was thecase. There are rumors that he escaped, and according to one very significantstory Cagliostro fled to India, where his talents received the appreciationdenied them in politics-ridden Europe.After creating his Egyptian Rite, Cagliostro declared that since women had beenadmitted into the ancient Mysteries there was no reason why they should beexcluded from the modern orders. The Princesse de Lamballe graciously acceptedthe dignity of Mistress of Honor in his secret society, and on the evening ofher initiation the most important members of the French court were present. Thebrilliance of the affair attracted the attention of the Masonic lodges in Paris.Their representatives, in a sincere desire to understand the Masonic Mysteries,chose the learned orientalist Court de Gébelin as their spokesman, and invitedComte di Cagliostro to attend a conference to assist in clearing up a number ofimportant questions concerning Masonic philosophy. The Comte accepted theinvtation.On May 10, 1785, Cagliostro attended the conference called for that purpose, andhis power and simplicity immediately won for him the favorable opinion of theentire gathering. It took but a few words for the Court de Gébelin to discoverthat he was talking not only to a fellow scholar but to a man infinitely hissuperior. Cagliostro immediately presented an address, which was so unexpected,so totally different from anything ever heard before by those assembled, thatall were speechless with amazement. Cagliostro declared the Rose-Cross to be theancient and true symbol of the Mysteries and, after a brief description of itsoriginal symbolism, branched out into a consideration of the symbolic meaning ofletters, predicting to the assembly the future of France in a graphic mannerthat left no room for doubt that the speaker was a man of insight andsupernatural power. With a curious arrangement of the letters of the alphabet,Cagliostro foretold in detail the horrors of the coming revolution and the fallof the monarchy, describing minutely the fate of the various members of theroyal family. He also prophesied the advent of Napoleon and the rise of theFirst Empire. All this he did to demonstrate that which can be accomplished bysuperior knowledge.Later when arrested and sent to the Bastille, Cagliostro wrote on the wall ofhis cell the following cryptic message which, when interpreted, reads: “In 1789the besieged Bastille will on July 14th be pulled down by you from top tobottom.” Cagliostro was the mysterious agent of the Knights Templars, theRosicrucian initiate whose magnificent store of learning is attested by theprofundity of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. Thus Comte di Cagliostro remainsone of the strangest characters in history—believed by his friends to have livedforever and to have taken part in the marriage feast of Cana, and accused by hisenemies of being the Devil incarnate! His powers of prophecy are ably describedby Alexandre Dumas in The Queen’s Necklace. The world he sought to serve in hisown strange way received him not, but has followed with relentless persecutiondown through the centuries even the very memory of this illustrious adept who,unable to accomplish the great labor at hand, stepped aside in favor of his moresuccessful compatriot, the Comte de St.-Germain."},{"pageContent":"THE COMTE DE ST.-GERMAIN During the early part of the eighteenth century there appeared in the diplomaticcircles of Europe the most baffling personality of history—a man whose life wasso near a synonym of mystery that the enigma of his true identity was asinsolvable to his contemporaries as it has been to later investigators. TheComte de St.-Germain was recognized as the outstanding scholar and linguist ofhis day. His versatile accomplishments extended from chemistry and history topoetry and music. He played several musical instruments with great skill andamong his numerous compositions was a short opera. He was also an artist of rareability and the remarkably luminous effects which he created on canvas arebelieved to have been the result of his mixing powdered mother-of-pearl with hispigments. He gained worldwide distinction for his ability to reproduce in hispaintings the original luster of the precious stones appearing upon the costumesof his subjects. His linguistic proficiency verged on the supernatural. He spokeGerman, English, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French with a Piedmontese accent,Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic, and Chinese with such fluency that in every landhe visited he was accepted as a native. He was ambidextrous to such a degreethat he could write the same article with both hands simultaneously When the twopieces of paper were afterwards placed together with a light behind them, thewriting on one sheet exactly covered, letter for letter, the writing on theother.As a historian, the Comte de St.-Germain possessed uncanny knowledge of everyoccurrence of the preceding two thousand years, and in his reminiscences hedescribed in intimate detail events of previous centuries in which he had playedimportant rôles. He assisted Mesmer in developing the theory of mesmerism, andin all probability was the actual discoverer of that science. His knowledge ofchemistry was so profound that he could remove flaws from diamonds and otherprecious stones—a feat which he actually performed at the request of Louis XV in1757. He was also recognized as an art critic without a peer and was oftenconsulted regarding paintings accredited to the great masters. His claim to thepossession of the fabled elixir of life was borne witness to by Madame dePompadour, who discovered, she declared, that he had presented a lady of thecourt with a certain priceless liquid which had had the effect of preserving heryouthful vivacity and beauty for over twenty-five years beyond the normal term.The startling accuracy of his prophetic utterances gained for him no smalldegree of fame. To Marie Antoinette he predicted the fall of the Frenchmonarchy, and he was also aware of the unhappy fate of the royal family yearsbefore the Revolution actually took place. The crowning evidence, however, ofthe Comte’s genius was his penetrating grasp of the political situation ofEurope and the consummate skill with which he parried the thrusts of hisdiplomatic adversaries. He was employed by a number of European governments,including the French, as a secret agent, and at all times bore credentials whichgave him entrée to the most exclusive circles.In her excellent monograph, The Comte de St. -Germain, the Secret of Kings, Mrs.Cooper-Oakley lists the most important names under which this amazing personmasqueraded between the years 1710 and 1822. “During this time,” she writes, “wehave M. de St.-Germain as the Marquis de Montferrat, Comte Bella- marre or Aymarat Venice, Chevalier Schoening at Pisa, Chevalier Weldon at Milan and Leipzig,Comte Soltikoff at Genoa and Leghorn, Graf Tzarogy at Schwalbach and Triesdorf,Prinz Ragoczy at Dresden, and Comte de St.-Germain at Paris, The Hague, London,and St. Petersburg.” It is evident that M. de St.-Germain adopted these variousnames in the interests of the political secret service work which historianshave presumed to be the major mission of his life.The Comte de St.-Germain has been described as of medium height, wellproportioned in body, and of regular and pleasing features. His complexion wassomewhat swarthy and his hair dark, though often shown powdered. He dressedsimply, usually in black, but his clothes were well fitting and of the bestquality. He had apparently a mania for diamonds, which he wore not only in ringsbut also in his watch and chain, his snuff box, and upon his buckles. A jew-eler once estimated the value of his shoe buckles at 200,000 francs. The Comteis generally depicted as a man in middle life, entirely devoid of wrinkles andfree from any physical infirmity. He ate no meat and drank no wine, in factseldom dined in the presence of any second person. Although he was looked uponas a charlatan and impostor by a few nobles at the French court, Louis XVseverely reprimanded a courtier who made a disparaging remark concerning him.The grace and dignity that characterized his conduct, together with his perfectcontrol of every situation, attested the innate refinement and culture of one“to the. manner born.” This remarkable person also had the surprising andimpressive ability to divine, even to the most minute details, the questions ofhis inquisitors before they were asked. By something akin to telepathy he wasalso able to feel when his presence was needed in some distant city or state,and it has even been recorded of him that he had the astonishing habit not onlyof appearing in his own apartment and in those of friends without resorting tothe conventionality of the door but also of departing therefrom in a similarmanner.M. de St.-Germain’s travels covered many countries. During the reign of PeterIII he was in Russia and between the years 1737 and 1742 in the court of theShah of Persia as an honored guest. On the subject of his wanderings Una Birchwrites: “The travels of the Comte de Saint-Germain covered a long period ofyears and a great range of countries. From Persia to France and from Calcutta toRome he was known and respected. Horace Walpole spoke with him in London in1745; Clive knew him in India in 1756; Madame d’Adhémar alleges that she met himin Paris in 1789, five years after his supposed death; while other personspretended to have held conversations with him in the early nineteenth century.He was on familiar and intimate terms with the crowned heads of Europe and thehonoured friend of many distinguished persons of all nationalities. He is evenmentioned in the memoirs and letters of the day, and always as a man of mystery.Frederick the Great, Voltaire, Madame de Pompadour, Rousseau, Chatham, andWalpole, all of whom knew him personally, rivalled each other in curiosity as tohis origin. During the many decades in which he was before the world, however,no one succeeded in discovering why he appeared as a Jacobite agent in London,as a conspirator in Petersburg, as an alchemist and connoisseur of pictures inParis, or as a Russian general at Naples. * * * Now and again the curtain whichshrouds his actions is drawn aside, and we are permitted to see him fiddling inthe music room at Versailles, gossiping with Horace Walpole in London, sittingin Frederick the Great’s library at Berlin, or conducting illuminist meetings incaverns by the Rhine.” (See The Nineteenth Century, January,1908.)The Comte de St.-Germain has been generally regarded as an important figure inearly activities of the Freemasons. Repeated efforts, however, probably with anulterior motive, have been made to discredit his Masonic affiliations. Anexample of this is the account appearing in The Secret Tradition in Freemasonry,by Arthur Edward Waite. This author, after making several rather disparagingremarks on the subject, amplifies his article by reproducing an engraving of thewrong Comte de St.-Germain, apparently being unable to distinguish between thegreat illuminist and the French general. It will yet be established beyond alldoubt that the Comte de St.-Germain was both a Mason and a Templar; in fact thememoirs of Cagliostro contain a direct statement of his initiation into theorder of the Knights Templars at the hands of St.-Germain. Many of theillustrious personages with whom the Comte de St.-Germain associated were highMasons, and sufficient memoranda have been preserved concerning the discussionswhich they held to prove that he was a master of Freemasonic lore. It is alsoreasonably certain that he was connected with the Rosicrucians—possibly havingbeen the actual head of that order.The Comte de St.-Germain was thoroughly conversant with the principles ofOriental esotericism. He practiced the Eastern system of meditation andconcentration, upon several occasions having been seen seated with his feetcrossed and hands folded in the posture of a Hindu Buddha. He had a retreat inthe heart of the Himalayas to which he retired periodically from the world. Onone occasion he declared that he would remain in India for eighty-five years andthen would return to the scene of his European labors. At various times headmitted that he was obeying the orders of a power higher and greater thanhimself. What he did not say was that this superior power was the Mystery schoolwhich had sent him into the world to accomplish a definite mission. The Comte deSt.-Germain and Sir Francis Bacon are the two greatest emissaries sent into theworld by the Secret Brotherhood in the last thousand years.E. Francis Udny, a Theosophical writer, is of the belief that the Comte deSt.-Germain was not the son of Prince Rákóczy of Transylvania, but because ofhis age could have been none other than the prince himself, who was known to beof a deep philosophic and mystic nature. The same writer believes the Comte deSt.-Germain passed through the “philosophic death” as Francis Bacon in 1626, asFrancois Rákóczy in 1735, and as Comte de St.-Germain in 1784. He also feelsthat the Comte de St.-Germain was the famous Comte de Gabalis, and as CountHompesch was the last Grand Master of the Knights of Malta. It is well knownthat many members of the European secret societies have feigned death forvarious purposes. Marshal Ney, a member of the Society of Unknown Philosophers,escaped the firing squad and under the name of Peter Stuart Ney lived and taughtschool for over thirty years in North Carolina. On his deathbed, P. S. Ney toldDoctor Locke, the attending physician, that he was Marshal Ney of France.In concluding an article on the identity of the inscrutable Comte deSt.-Germain, Andrew Lang writes: “Did Saint-Germain really die in the palace ofPrince Charles of Hesse about 1780-85? Did he, on the other hand, escape fromthe French prison where Grosley thought he saw him, during the FrenchRevolution? Was he known to Lord Lytton about 1860? * * * Is he the mysteriousMuscovite adviser of the Dalai Lama? Who knows? He is a will-o’-the-wisp of thememoir-writers of the eighteenth century.” (See Historical Mysteries.)"},{"pageContent":"EPISODES FROM AMERICAN HISTORY Many times the question has been asked, Was Francis Bacon’s vision of the “NewAtlantis” a prophetic dream of the great civilization which was so soon to riseupon the soil of the New World? It cannot be doubted that the secret societiesof Europe conspired to establish upon the American continent “a new nation,conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are createdequal.” Two incidents in the early history of the United States evidence theinfluence of that silent body which has so long guided the destinies of peoplesand religions. By them nations are created as vehicles for the promulgation ofideals, and while nations are true to these ideals they survive; when they varyfrom them they vanish like the Atlantis of old which had ceased to “know thegods.”In his admirable little treatise, Our Flag, Robert Allen Campbell revives thedetails of an obscure, but most important, episode of American history—thedesigning of the Colonial flag of 1775. The account involves a mysterious manconcerning whom no information is available other than that he was on familiarterms with both General George Washington and Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Thefollowing description of him is taken from Campbell’s treatise:“Little seems to have been known concerning this old gentleman; and in thematerials from which this account is compiled his name is not even oncementioned, for he is uniformly spoken of or referred to as ‘the Professor.’ Hewas evidently far beyond his threescore and ten years; and he often referred tohistorical events of more than a century previous just as if he had been aliving witness of their occurrence; still he was erect, vigorous andactive—hale, hearty, and clear-minded—as strong and energetic every way as inthe prime of his life. He was tall, of fine figure, perfectly easy, and verydignified in his manners; being at once courteous, gracious and commanding. Hewas, for those times and considering the customs of the Colonists, very peculiarin his method of living; for he ate no flesh, fowl or fish; he never used forfood any ‘green thing,’ any roots or anything unripe; he drank no liquor, wineor ale; but confined his diet to cereals and their products, fruits that wereripened on the stem in the sun, nuts, mild tea and the sweets of honey, sugar ormolasses.“He was well educated, highly cultivated, of extensive as well as variedinformation, and very studious. He spent considerable of his time in the patientand persistent conning of a number of very rare old books and ancientmanuscripts which he seemed to be deciphering, translating or rewriting. Thesebooks and manuscripts, together with his own writings, he never showed toanyone; and he did not even mention them in his conversations with the family,except in the most casual way; and he always locked them up carefully in alarge, old-fashioned, cubically shaped, iron-bound, heavy, oaken chest, wheneverhe left his room, even for his meals. He took long and frequent walks alone, saton the brows of the neighboring hills, or mused in the midst of the green andflower-gemmed meadows. He was fairly liberal—but in no way lavish—in spendinghis money, with which he was well supplied. He was a quiet, though a very genialand very interesting, member of the family; and he was seemingly at home uponany and every topic coming up in conversation. He was, in short, one whomeveryone would notice and respect, whom few would feel well acquainted with, andwhom no one would presume to question concerning himself—as to whence he came,why he tarried, or whither he journeyed.”By something more than a mere coincidence the committee appointed by theColonial Congress to design a flag accepted an invitation to be guests, while inCambridge, of the same family with which the Professor was staying. It was herethat General Washington joined them for the purpose of deciding upon a fittingemblem. By the signs which passed between them it was evident that both GeneralWashington and Doctor Franklin recognized the Professor, and by unanimousapproval he was invited to become an active member of the committee. During theproceedings which followed, the Professor was treated with the most profoundrespect and all of his suggestions immediately acted upon. He submitted apattern which he considered symbolically appropriate for the new flag, and thiswas unhesitatingly accepted by the other six members of the committee, who votedthat the arrangement suggested by the Professor be forthwith adopted. After theepisode of the flag the Professor quietly vanished, and nothing further is knownconcerning him.Did General Washington and Doctor Franklin recognize the Professor as anemissary of the Mystery school which has so long controlled the politicaldestinies of this planet? Benjamin Franklin was a philosopher and aFreemason—possibly a Rosicrucian initiate. He and the Marquis de Lafayette—alsoa man of mystery—constitute two of the most important links in the chain ofcircumstance that culminated in the establishment of the original thirteenAmerican Colonies as a free and independent nation. Doctor Franklin’sphilosophic attainments are well attested in Poor Richard’s Almanac, publishedby him for many years under the name of Richard Saunders. His interest in thecause of Freemasonry is also shown by his republication of Anderson’sConstitutions of Freemasonry, a rare and much disputed work on the subject.It was during the evening of July 4, 1776, that the second of these mysteriousepisodes occurred. In the old State House in Philadelphia a group of men weregathered for the momentous task of severing the last tie between the old countryand the new It was a grave moment and not a few of those present feared thattheir lives would be the forfeit for their audacity. In the midst of the debatea fierce voice rang out. The debaters stopped and turned to look upon thestranger. Who was this man who had suddenly appeared in their midst andtransfixed them with his oratory? They had never seen him before, none knew whenhe had entered, but his tall form and pale face filled them with awe. His voiceringing with a holy zeal, the stranger stirred them to their very souls. Hisclosing words rang through the building: “God has given America to be free!” Asthe stranger sank into a chair exhausted, a wild enthusiasm burst forth. Nameafter name was placed upon the parchment: the Declaration of Independence wassigned. But where was the man who had precipitated the accomplishment of thisimmortal task—who had lifted for a moment the veil from the eyes of theassemblage and revealed to them a part at least of the great purpose for whichthe new nation was conceived? He had disappeared, nor was he ever seen again orhis identity established. This episode parallels others of a similar kindrecorded by ancient historians attendant upon the founding of every new nation.Are they coincidences, or do they demonstrate that the divine wisdom of theancient Mysteries still is present in the world, serving mankind as it did ofold?"},{"pageContent":"XLVII Conclusion Philip, King of Macedon, ambitious to obtain the teacher who would be mostcapable of imparting the higher branches of learning to his fourteen-year-oldson, Alexander, and wishing the prince to have for his mentor the most famousand learned of the great philosophers, decided to communicate with Aristotle. Hedispatched the following letter to the Greek sage: “PHILIP TO ARISTOTLE, HEALTH:Know that I have a son. I render the gods many thanks; not so much for hisbirth, as that he was born in your time, for I hope that being educated andinstructed by you, he will become worthy of us both and the kingdom which heshall inherit.” Accepting Philip’s invitation, Aristotle journeyed to Macedon inthe fourth year of the 108th Olympiad, and remained for eight years as the tutorof Alexander. The young prince’s affection for his instructor became as great asthat which he felt for his father. He said that his father had given him being,but that Aristotle had given him well-being.The basic principles of the Ancient Wisdom were imparted to Alexander the Greatby Aristotle, and at the philosopher’s feet the Macedonian youth came to realizethe transcendency of Greek learning as it was personified in Plato’s immortaldisciple. Elevated by his illumined teacher to the threshold of the philosophicsphere, he beheld the world of the sages—the world that fate and the limitationsof his own soul decreed he should not conquer.Aristotle in his leisure hours edited and annotated the Iliad of Homer andpresented the finished volume to Alexander. This book the young conqueror sohighly prized that he carried it with him on all his campaigns. At the time ofhis triumph over Darius, discovering among the spoils a magnificent, gem-studdedcasket of unguents, he dumped its contents upon the ground, declaring that atlast he had found a case worthy of Aristotle’s edition of the Iliad!While on his Asiatic campaign, Alexander learned that Aristotle had publishedone of his most prized discourses, an occurrence which deeply grieved the youngking. So to Aristotle, Conqueror of the Unknown, Alexander, Con- queor of theKnown, sent his reproachful and pathetic admission of the insufficiency ofworldly pomp and power: “ALEXANDER TO ARISTOTLE, HEALTH: You were wrong inpublishing those branches of science hitherto not to be acquired except fromoral instruction. In what shall I excel others if the more profound knowledge Igained from you be communicated to all? For my part I had rather surpass themajority of mankind in the sublimer branches of learning, than in extent ofpower and dominion. Farewell.” The receipt of this amazing letter caused noripple in the placid life of Aristotle, who replied that although the discoursehad been communicated to the multitudes, none who had not heard him deliver thelecture (who lacked spiritual comprehension) could understand its true import.A few short years and Alexander the Great went the way of all flesh, and withhis body crumbled the structure of empire erected upon his personality. One yearlater Aristotle also passed into that greater world concerning whose mysterieshe had so often discoursed with his disciples in the Lyceum. But, as Aristotleexcelled Alexander in life, so he excelled him in death; for though his bodymoldered in an obscure tomb, the great philosopher continued to live in hisintellectual achievements. Age after age paid him grateful tribute, generationafter generation pondered over his theorems until by the sheer transcendency ofhis rational faculties Aristotle—“the master of those who know,” as Dante hascalled him—became the actual conqueror of the very world which Alexander hadsought to subdue with the sword.Thus it is demonstrated that to capture a man it is not sufficient to enslavehis body—it is necessary to enlist his reason; that to free a man it is notenough to strike the shackles from his limbs—his mind must be liberated frombondage to his own ignorance. Physical conquest must ever fail, for, generatinghatred and dissension, it spurs the mind to the avenging of an outraged body;but all men are bound whether willingly or unwillingly to obey that intellect inwhich they recognize qualities and virtues superior to their own. That thephilosophic culture of ancient Greece, Egypt, and India excelled that of themodern world must be admitted by all, even by the most confirmed of modernists.The golden era of Greek aesthetics, intellectualism, and ethics has never sincebeen equaled. The true philosopher belongs to the most noble order of men: thenation or race which is blessed by possession of illumined thinkers is fortunateindeed, and its name shall be remembered for their sake. In the famousPythagorean school at Crotona, philosophy was regarded as indispensable to thelife of man. He who did not comprehend the dignity of the reasoning power couldnot properly be said to live. Therefore, when through innate perverseness amember either voluntarily withdrew or was forcibly ejected from the philosophicfraternity, a headstone was set up for him in the community graveyard; for hewho had forsaken intellectual and ethical pursuits to reenter the materialsphere with its illusions of sense and false ambition was regarded as one deadto the sphere of Reality. The life represented by the thraldom of the senses thePythagoreans conceived to be spiritual death, while they regarded death to thesense-world as spiritual life.Philosophy bestows life in that it reveals the dignity and purpose of living.Materiality bestows death in that it benumbs or clouds those faculties of thehuman soul which should be responsive to the enlivening impulses of creativethought of ennobling virtue. How inferior to these standards of remote days arethe laws by which men live in the twentieth century! Today man, a sublimecreature with infinite capacity for self-improvement, in an effort to be true tofalse standards, turns from his birthright of understanding—without realizingthe consequences—and plunges into the maelstrom of material illusion. Theprecious span of his earthly years he devotes to the pathetically futile effortto establish himself as an enduring power in a realm of unenduring things.Gradually the memory of his life as a spiritual being vanishes from hisobjective mind and he focuses all his partly awakened faculties upon theseething beehive of industry which he has come to consider the sole actuality.From the lofty heights of his Self hood he slowly sinks into the gloomy depthsof ephemerality. He falls to the level of the beast, and in brutish fashionmumbles the problems arising from his all too insufficient knowledge of theDivine Plan. Here in the lurid turmoil of a great industrial, political,commercial inferno, men writhe in self-inflicted agony and, reaching out intothe swirling mists, strive to clutch and hold the grotesque phantoms of successand power.Ignorant of the cause of life, ignorant of the purpose of life, ignorant of whatlies beyond the mystery of death, yet possessing within himself the answer to itall, man is willing to sacrifice the beautiful, the true, and the good withinand without upon the blood-stained altar of worldly ambition. The world ofphilosophy—that beautiful garden of thought wherein the sages dwell in the bondof fraternity—fades from view. In its place rises an empire of stone, steel,smoke, and hate—a world in which millions of creatures potentially human scurryto and fro in the desperate effort to exist and at the same time maintain thevast institution which they have erected and which, like some mighty Juggernaut,is rumbling inevitably towards an unknown end. In this physical empire, whichman erects in the vain belief that he can outshine the kingdom of thecelestials, everything is changed to stone. Fascinated by the glitter of gain,man gazes at the Medusa-like face of greed and stands petrified.In this commercial age science is concerned solely with the classification ofphysical knowledge and investigation of the temporal and illusionary parts ofNature. Its so-called practical discoveries bind man but more tightly with thebonds of physical limitation. Religion, too, has become materialistic: thebeauty and dignity of faith is measured by huge piles of masonry, by tracts ofreal estate, or by the balance sheet. Philosophy which connects heaven and earthlike a mighty ladder, up the rungs of which the illumined of all ages haveclimbed into the living presence of Reality—even philosophy has become a prosaicand heterogeneous mass of conflicting notions. Its beauty, its dignity, itstranscendency are no more. Like other branches of human thought, it has beenmade materialistic—“ practical”—and its activities so directionalized that theymay also contribute their part to the erection of this modern world of stone andsteel.In the ranks of the so-called learned there is rising up a new order ofthinkers, which may best be termed the School of the Worldly Wise Men. Afterarriving at the astounding conclusion that they are the intellectual salt of theearth, these gentlemen of letters have appointed themselves the final judges ofall knowledge, both human and divine. This group affirms that all mystics musthave been epileptic and most of the saints neurotic! It declares God to be afabrication of primitive superstition; the universe to be intended for noparticular purpose; immortality to be a figment of the imagination; and anoutstanding individuality to be but a fortuitous combination of cells!Pythagoras is asserted to have suffered from a “bean complex”; Socrates was anotorious inebriate; St. Paul was subject to fits; Paracelsus was an infamousquack, the Comte di Cagliostro a mountebank, and the Comte de St.-Germain theoutstanding crook of history!What do the lofty concepts of the world’s illumined saviors and sages have incommon with these stunted, distorted products of the “realism” of this century?All over the world men and women ground down by the soulless cultural systems oftoday are crying out for the return of the banished age of beauty andenlightenment—for something practical in the highest sense of the word. A feware beginning to realize that so-called civilization in its present form is atthe vanishing point; that coldness, heartlessness, commercialism, and materialefficiency are impractical, and only that which offers opportunity for theexpression of love and ideality is truly worth while. All the world is seekinghappiness, but knows not in what direction to search. Men must learn thathappiness crowns the soul’s quest for understanding. Only through therealization of infinite goodness and infinite accomplishment can the peace ofthe inner Self be assured. In spite of man’s geocentricism, there is somethingin the human mind that is reaching out to philosophy—not to this or thatphilosophic code, but simply to philosophy in the broadest and fullest sense.The great philosophic institutions of the past must rise again, for these alonecan rend the veil which divides the world of causes from that of effects. Onlythe Mysteries—those sacred Colleges of Wisdom—can reveal to struggling humanitythat greater and more glorious universe which is the true home of the spiritualbeing called man. Modern philosophy has failed in that it has come to regardthinking as simply an intellectual process. Materialistic thought is as hopelessa code of life as commercialism itself. The power to think true is the savior ofhumanity. The mythological and historical Redeemers of every age were allpersonifications of that power. He who has a little more rationality than hisneighbor is a little better than his neighbor. He who functions on a higherplane of rationality than the rest of the world is termed the greatest thinker.He who functions on a lower plane is regarded as a barbarian. Thus comparativerational development is the true gauge of the individual’s evolutionary status.Briefly stated, the true purpose of ancient philosophy was to discover a methodwhereby development of the rational nature could be accelerated instead ofawaiting the slower processes of Nature. This supreme source of power, thisattainment of knowledge, this unfolding of the god within, is concealed underthe epigrammatic statement of the philosophic life. This was the key to theGreat Work, the mystery of the Philosopher’s Stone, for it meant that alchemicaltransmutation had been accomplished. Thus ancient philosophy was primarily theliving of a life; secondarily, an intellectual method. He alone can become aphilosopher in the highest sense who lives the philosophic life. What man liveshe comes to know. Consequently, a great philosopher is one whose threefoldlife—physical, mental, and spiritual—is wholly devoted to and completelypermeated by his rationality.Man’s physical, emotional, and mental natures provide environments of reciprocalbenefit or detriment to each other. Since the physical nature is the immediateenvironment of the mental, only that mind is capable of rational thinking whichis enthroned in a harmonious and highly refined material constitution. Henceright action, right feeling, and right thinking are prerequisites of rightknowing, and the attainment of philosophic power is possible only to such ashave harmonized their thinking with their living. The wise have thereforedeclared that none can attain to the highest in the science of knowing untilfirst he has attained to the highest in the science of living. Philosophic poweris the natural outgrowth of the philosophic life. Just as an intense physicalexistence emphasizes the importance of physical things, or just as the monasticmetaphysical asceticism establishes the desirability of the ecstatic state, socomplete philosophic absorption ushers the consciousness of the thinker into themost elevated and noble of all spheres—the pure philosophic, or rational, world.In a civilization primarily concerned with the accomplishment of the extremes oftemporal activity, the philosopher represents an equilibrating intellect capableof estimating and guiding the cultural growth. The establishment of thephilosophic rhythm in the nature of an individual ordinarily requires fromfifteen to twenty years. During that entire period the disciples of old wereconstantly subjected to the most severe discipline. Every activity of life wasgradually disengaged from other interests and focalized upon the reasoning part.In the ancient world there was another and most vital factor which entered intothe production of rational intellects and which is entirely beyond thecomprehension of modern thinkers: namely, initiation into the philosophicMysteries. A man who had demonstrated his peculiar mental and spiritual fitnesswas accepted into the body of the learned and to him was revealed that pricelessheritage of arcane lore preserved from generation to generation. This heritageof philosophic truth is the matchless treasure of all ages, and each discipleadmitted into these brotherhoods of the wise made, in turn, his individualcontribution to this store of classified knowledge.The one hope of the world is philosophy, for all the sorrows of modern liferesult from the lack of a proper philosophic code. Those who sense even in partthe dignity of life cannot but realize the shallowness apparent in theactivities of this age. Well has it been said that no individual can succeeduntil he has developed his philosophy of life. Neither can a race or nationattain true greatness until it has formulated an adequate philosophy and hasdedicated its existence to a policy consistent with that philosophy. During theWorld War, when so-called civilization hurled one half of itself against theother in a frenzy of hate, men ruthlessly destroyed something more precious eventhan human life: they obliterated those records of human thought by which lifecan be intelligently directionalized. Truly did Mohammed declare the ink ofphilosophers to be more precious than the blood of martyrs. Priceless documents,invaluable records of achievement, knowledge founded on ages of patientobservation and experimentation by the elect of the earth—all were destroyedwith scarcely a qualm of regret. What was knowledge, what was truth, beauty,love, idealism, philosophy, or religion when compared to man’s desire to controlan infinitesimal spot in the fields of Cosmos for an inestimably minute fragmentof time? Merely to satisfy some whim or urge of ambition man would uproot theuniverse, though well he knows that in a few short years he must depart, leavingall that he has seized to posterity as an old cause for fresh contention.War—the irrefutable evidence of irrationality—still smolders in the hearts ofmen; it cannot die until human selfishness is overcome. Armed with multifariousinventions and destructive agencies, civilization will continue its fratricidalstrife through future ages. But upon the mind of man there is dawning a greatfear—the fear that eventually civilization will destroy itself in one greatcataclysmic struggle. Then must be reenacted the eternal drama ofreconstruction. Out of the ruins of the civilization which died when itsidealism died, some primitive people yet in the womb of destiny must build a newworld. Foreseeing the needs of that day, the philosophers of the ages havedesired that into the structure of this new world shall be incorporated thetruest and finest of all that has gone before. It is a divine law that the sumof previous accomplishment shall be the foundation of each new order of things.The great philosophic treasures of humanity must be preserved. That which issuperficial may be allowed to perish; that which is fundamental and essentialmust remain, regardless of cost.Two fundamental forms of ignorance were recognized by the Platonists: simpleignorance and complex ignorance. Simple ignorance is merely lack of knowledgeand is common to all creatures existing posterior to the First Cause, whichalone has perfection of knowledge. Simple ignorance is an ever-active agent,urging the soul onward to the acquisition of knowledge. From this virginal stateof unawareness grows the desire to become aware with its resultant improvementin the mental condition. The human intellect is ever surrounded by forms ofexistence beyond the estimation of its partly developed faculties. In this realmof objects not understood is a never-failing source of mental stimuli. Thuswisdom eventually results from the effort to cope rationally with the problem ofthe unknown.In the last analysis, the Ultimate Cause alone can be denominated wise; insimpler words, only God is good. Socrates declared knowledge, virtue, andutility to be one with the innate nature of good. Knowledge is a condition ofknowing; virtue a condition of being; utility a condition of doing. Consideringwisdom as synonymous with mental completeness, it is evident that such a statecan exist only in the Whole, for that which is less than the Whole cannotpossess the fullness of the All. No part of creation is complete; hence eachpart is imperfect to the extent that it falls short of entirety. Whereincompleteness is, it also follows that ignorance must be coexistent; for everypart, while capable of knowing its own Self, cannot become aware of the Self inthe other parts. Philosophically considered, growth from the standpoint of humanevolution is a process proceeding from heterogeneity to homogeneity. In time,therefore, the isolated consciousness of the individual fragments is reunited tobecome the complete consciousness of the Whole. Then, and then only, is thecondition of all-knowing an absolute reality.Thus all creatures are relatively ignorant yet relatively wise; comparativelynothing yet comparatively all. The microscope reveals to man his significance;the telescope, his insignificance. Through the eternities of existence man isgradually increasing in both wisdom and understanding; his ever-expandingconsciousness is including more of the external within the area of itself. Evenin man’s present state of imperfection it is dawning upon his realization thathe can never be truly happy until he is perfect, and that of all the facultiescontributing to his self-perfection none is equal in importance to the rationalintellect. Through the labyrinth of diversity only the illumined mind can, andmust, lead the soul into the perfect light of unity.In addition to the simple ignorance which is the most potent factor in mentalgrowth there exists another, which is of a far more dangerous and subtle type.This second form, called twofold or complex ignorance, may be briefly defined asignorance of ignorance. Worshiping the sun, moon, and stars, and offeringsacrifices to the winds, the primitive savage sought with crude fetishes topropitiate his unknown gods. He dwelt in a world filled with wonders which hedid not understand. Now great cities stand where once roamed the Crookboned men.Humanity no longer regards itself as primitive or aboriginal. The spirit ofwonder and awe has been succeeded by one of sophistication. Today man worshipshis own accomplishments, and either relegates the immensities of time and spaceto the background of his consciousness or disregards them entirely.The twentieth century makes a fetish of civilization and is overwhelmed by itsown fabrications; its gods are of its own fashioning. Humanity has forgotten howinfinitesimal, how impermanent and how ignorant it actually is. Ptolemy has beenridiculed for conceiving the earth to be the center of the universe, yet moderncivilization is seemingly founded upon the hypothesis that the planet earth isthe most permanent and important of all the heavenly spheres, and that the godsfrom their starry thrones are fascinated by the monumental and epochal eventstaking place upon this spherical ant-hill in Chaos.From age to age men ceaselessly toil to build cities that they may rule overthem with pomp and power—as though a fillet of gold or ten million vassals couldelevate man above the dignity of his own thoughts and make the glitter of hisscepter visible to the distant stars. As this tiny planet rolls along its orbitin space, it carries with it some two billion human beings who live and dieoblivious to that immeasurable existence lying beyond the lump on which theydwell. Measured by the infinities of time and space, what are the captains ofindustry or the lords of finance? If one of these plutocrats should rise untilhe ruled the earth itself, what would he be but a petty despot seated on a grainof Cosmic dust?Philosophy reveals to man his kinship with the All. It shows him that he is abrother to the suns which dot the firmament; it lifts him from a taxpayer on awhirling atom to a citizen of Cosmos. It teaches him that while physically boundto earth (of which his blood and bones are part), there is nevertheless withinhim a spiritual power, a diviner Self, through which he is one with the symphonyof the Whole. Ignorance of ignorance, then, is that self-satisfied state ofunawareness in which man, knowing nothing outside the limited area of hisphysical senses, bumptiously declares there is nothing more to know! He whoknows no life save the physical is merely ignorant; but he who declares physicallife to be all-important and elevates it to the position of supreme reality—sucha one is ignorant of his own ignorance.If the Infinite had not desired man to become wise, He would not have bestowedupon him the faculty of knowing. If He had not intended man to become virtuous,He would not have sown within the human heart the seeds of virtue. If He hadpredestined man to be limited to his narrow physical life, He would not haveequipped him with perceptions and sensibilities capable of grasping, in part atleast, the immensity of the outer universe. The criers of philosophy call allmen to a comradeship of the spirit: to a fraternity of thought: to a convocationof Selves. Philosophy invites man out of the vainness of selfishness; out of thesorrow of ignorance and the despair of worldliness; out of the travesty ofambition and the cruel clutches of greed; out of the red hell of hate and thecold tomb of dead idealism.Philosophy would lead all men into the broad, calm vistas of truth, for theworld of philosophy is a land of peace where those finer qualities pent upwithin each human soul are given opportunity for expression. Here men are taughtthe wonders of the blades of grass; each stick and stone is endowed with speechand tells the secret of its being. All life, bathed in the radiance ofunderstanding, becomes a wonderful and beautiful reality. From the four cornersof creation swells a mighty anthem of rejoicing, for here in the light ofphilosophy is revealed the purpose of existence; the wisdom and goodnesspermeating the Whole become evident to even man’s imperfect intellect. Here theyearning heart of humanity finds that companionship which draws forth from theinnermost recesses of the soul that great store of good which lies there likeprecious metal in some deep hidden vein.Following the path pointed out by the wise, the seeker after truth ultimatelyattains to the summit of wisdom’s mount, and gazing down, beholds the panoramaof life spread out before him. The cities of the plains are but tiny specks andthe horizon on every hand is obscured by the gray haze of the Unknown. Then thesoul realizes that wisdom lies in breadth of vision; that it increases incomparison to the vista. Then as man’s thoughts lift him heavenward, streets arelost in cities, cities in nations, nations in continents, continents in theearth, the earth in space, and space in an infinite eternity, until at last buttwo things remain: the Self and the goodness of God.While man’s physical body resides with him and mingles with the heedless throng,it is difficult to conceive of man as actually inhabiting a world of his own—aworld which he has discovered by lifting himself into communion with theprofundities of his own internal nature. Man may live two lives. One is astruggle from the womb to the tomb. Its span is measured by man’s owncreation—time. Well may it be called the unheeding life. The other life is fromrealization to infinity. It begins with understanding, its duration is forever,and upon the plane of eternity it is consummated. This is called the philosophiclife. Philosophers are not born nor do they die; for once having achieved therealization of immortality, they are immortal. Having once communed with Self,they realize that within there is an immortal foundation that will not passaway. Upon this living, vibrant base—Self—they erect a civilization which willendure after the sun, the moon, and the stars have ceased to be. The fool livesbut for today; the philosopher lives forever.When once the rational consciousness of man rolls away the stone and comes forthfrom its sepulcher, it dies no more; for to this second or philosophic birththere is no dissolution. By this should not be inferred physical immortality,but rather that the philosopher has learned that his physical body is no morehis true Self than the physical earth is his true world. In the realization thathe and his body are dissimilar—that though the form must perish the life willnot fail—he achieves conscious immortality. This was the immortality to whichSocrates referred when he said: “Anytus and Melitus may indeed put me to death,but they cannot injure me.” To the wise, physical existence is but the outerroom of the hall of life. Swinging open the doors of this antechamber, theillumined pass into the greater and more perfect existence. The ignorant dwellin a world bounded by time and space. To those, however, who grasp the importand dignity of Being, these are but phantom shapes, illusions of thesenses—arbitrary limits imposed by man’s ignorance upon the duration of Deity.The philosopher lives and thrills with the realization of this duration, for tohim this infinite period has been designed by the All-Wise Cause as the time ofall accomplishment.Man is not the insignificant creature that he appears to be; his physical bodyis not the true measure of his real self. The invisible nature of man is as vastas his comprehension and as measureless as his thoughts. The fingers of his mindreach out and grasp the stars; his spirit mingles with the throbbing life ofCosmos itself. He who has attained to the state of understanding thereby has soincreased his capacity to know that he gradually incorporates within himself thevarious elements of the universe. The unknown is merely that which is yet to beincluded within the consciousness of the seeker. Philosophy assists man todevelop the sense of appreciation; for as it reveals the glory and thesufficiency of knowledge, it also unfolds those latent powers and facultieswhereby man is enabled to master the secrets of the seven spheres.From the world of physical pursuits the initiates of old called their disciplesinto the life of the mind and the spirit. Throughout the ages, the Mysterieshave stood at the threshold of Reality—that hypothetical spot between noumenonand phenomenon, the Substance and the shadow. The gates of the Mysteries standever ajar and those who will may pass through into the spacious domicile ofspirit. The world of philosophy lies neither to the right nor to the left,neither above nor below. Like a subtle essence permeating all space and allsubstance, it is everywhere; it penetrates the innermost and the outermost partsof all being. In every man and woman these two spheres are connected by a gatewhich leads from the not-self and its concerns to the Self and its realizations.In the mystic this gate is the heart, and through spiritualization of hisemotions he contacts that more elevated plane which, once felt and known,becomes the sum of the worth-while. In the philosopher, reason is the gatebetween the outer and the inner worlds, the illumined mind bridging the chasmbetween the corporeal and the incorporeal. Thus godhood is born within the onewho sees, and from the concerns of men he rises to the concerns of gods.In this era of “practical” things men ridicule even the existence of God. Theyscoff at goodness while they ponder with befuddled minds the phantasmagoria ofmateriality. They have forgotten the path which leads beyond the stars. Thegreat mystical institutions of antiquity which invited man to enter into hisdivine inheritance have crumbled, and institutions of human scheming now standwhere once the ancient homes of learning rose a mystery of fluted columns andpolished marble. The white-robed sages who gave to the world in ideals ofculture and beauty have gathered their robes about them and departed from thesight of men. Nevertheless, this little earth is bathed as of old in thesunlight of its Providential Generator. Wide-eyed babes still face the mysteriesof physical existence. Men continue to laugh and cry, to love and hate; somestill dream of a nobler world, a fuller life, a more perfect realization. Inboth the heart and mind of man the gates which lead from mortality toimmortality are still ajar. Virtue, love, and idealism are yet the regeneratorsof humanity God continues to love and guide the destinies of His creation. Thepath still winds upward to accomplishment. The soul of man has not been deprivedof its wings; they are merely folded under its garment of flesh. Philosophy isever that magic power which, sundering the vessel of clay, releases the soulfrom its bondage to habit and perversion. Still as of old, the soul released canspread its wings and soar to the very source of itself.The criers of the Mysteries speak again, bidding all men welcome to the House ofLight. The great institution of materiality has failed. The false civilizationbuilt by man has turned, and like the monster of Frankenstein, is destroying itscreator. Religion wanders aimlessly in the maze of theological speculation.Science batters itself impotently against the barriers of the unknown. Onlytranscendental philosophy knows the path. Only the illumined reason can carrythe understanding part of man upward to the light. Only philosophy can teach manto be born well, to live well, to die well, and in perfect measure be bornagain. Into this band of the elect—those who have chosen the life of knowledge,of virtue, and of utility—the philosophers of the ages invite YOU."},{"pageContent":"Bibliography VoLumes quoted from or Consulted in thePreparation of an Encyclopedie Outline ofMasonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and RosicrucianSymbolical Philosophy ADAMS, W.
