DANIEL GUNTHERThe book you are holding is the work of Thomas Stanley (1625-1678), as publishedin 1687. It consists of the long section he devoted to Pythagoras in hismasterful and massive tome The History of Philosophy. The timeless brilliance ofStanley's work is that it presented a survey of the classical writers ofantiquity that remains as contemporary today as it was over three hundred yearsago.A biographical sketch of the author is given by Manly Palmer Hall in thePreface, along with a profound overview of Pythagorean philosophy by Dr. HenryL. Drake in the Introduction. Manly P. Hall (1901-1990) founded thePhilosophical Research Society in 1934. He was a prolific author and lecturer,and remains a primary exponent of the Mystery Traditions in Western culture,especially because of his inspiring and comprehensive magnum opus, The SecretTeachings of All Ages. Dr. Drake (1906-1978), a close and loyal friend of Mr.Hall, served as vice-president of the Society for nearly three decades, inaddition to editing a collection of Plato's complete works. In 1970, thePhilosophical Research Society produced a facsimile edition of Stanley's work onPythagoras in a limited printing of 2000 copies. The Society has kindly allowedus to include Mr. Hall's Preface and Dr. Drake's Introduction to that facsimile.Our thanks to Paul Austad and the members of the Copyright Committee for theirgenerosity.We have reset the text from the 1687 edition of The History of Philosophy tomake it more accessible to the modern reader. We have generally regularizedspelling, replaced obsolete words that may not be found in a modern dictionary,and used contemporary conventions of punctuation. At the same time, we haveendeavored to leave as much of Stanley's expression intact as possible. Thereader will do well to allow the archaic tone of the language to become bothfamiliar and pleasant; its pacing seems to call forth a contemplative state ofmind. The editing has been done “silently” because of the extent of the workinvolved. Here is a representative sample of the original book that you maycompare with the typeset text on page 122 [p2_chap4.xhtml#page_122]. Thanks toYvonne Weiser of Ibis Press for helping to define and clarify this task, therebymaking it possible.images [images/frw.jpg]We have also attempted to correct and contextualize the extensive Greek languagereferences throughout the text. Thomas Stanley wrote at a time when it wasexpected that the average reader had been schooled in Latin and Greek, with awell-rounded knowledge of the classics. Not surprisingly therefore, he madenumerous references in Greek; often just a single word for clarification; atother times, phrases and sentences with only brief abbreviations noting thesource. To complicate matters, the Greek typeface of Stanley's day was quitedifferent from that employed today, as may be seen from the sample pageprovided. It was a florid script that incorporated a number of “abbreviations”representing various letter combinations that could potentially increment thestandard Greek alphabet set by a great many additional characters. Thesecharacters are no longer used today, and to a student accustomed only to modernGreek typefaces, even though such texts are visually striking, they arevirtually unreadable.The initial task was to regularize the Greek references to the convention of amodern Greek typeface in order to make them accessible. Each quotation was thenverified with the source document in Greek. Even so, it quickly became apparentthat Stanley's copious references would present an enormous challenge to thereader without some sense of context. His knowledge was encyclopedic,encompassing not only the masters of Greek philosophy, mathematics, music,poetry, geography and history, but the Patristic literature as well. Therefore,many of these references are discussed in the annotated appendix with additionalmaterial incorporated to clarify the meaning or context of the original quote. Acomplete bibliography has been included, detailing all the reference worksutilized.We have included a small Glossary with a number of terms, especially those frommusical theory which may be unfamiliar to the non-technical reader. In suchcases, the first occurrence of the word is presented in bold type to indicatethat it may be found in the Glossary. Certain other words are included as wellfor the reader's convenience. Comments in editorial brackets are ours, whilethose in parenthesis are by Stanley. We have tried to retain as much ofStanley's original organization of the text as practical. Because of the largenumber of chapters and various divisions of his original, we have decided tonumber the extensive endnotes sequentially for clarity. While we have spared noeffort in trying to understand and clarify as much of the text as possible, someof Stanley's original work was not clear to either of us.For the reader in search of the next step in the study of Pythagoras, werecommend two books from Phanes Press: The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library,compiled and translated by Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, edited and introduced byDavid Fideler. It includes many of the texts to which Stanley refers. The Manualof Harmonics of Nicomachus the Pythagorean, translation and commentary by FloraR. Levin, will help to clarify the complex musical material Stanley presents.This project would not have been possible without the diligent efforts of WiledaWasserman, who meticulously and painstakingly typed the manuscript from whichall further production advanced. Nicole Laliberte cheerfully persisted throughuntold hours of out-loud proofreading sessions to insure the most accuratereconstruction of Stanley's text. Thanks to Julia and Daniel Pineda for theirhelp in proofreading the finished manuscript, to Mike Estell for his assistancewith Greek and Latin sources, and to Dennis Deem for communicating theprinciples of geometric drawing so many years ago. Special thanks to David L.Vagi, author of Coinage and History of the Roman Empire, for sourcing photos andwriting captions for the ancient Greek coins that grace these pages, and for hishelp with the map (whose place names, for the most part, reflect Stanley'sspelling). Thanks also to Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. and Numismatica ArsClassica for permission to reproduce their images of the coins.Walking in the company of such giants as Pythagoras, Thomas Stanley, Manly Hall,and Henry Drake has been a great honor for both of us."},{"pageContent":"PREFACEMANLY P. HALLIt is now generally acknowledged that Thomas Stanley was the first Englishhistorian of philosophy. He had an orderly but versatile mind and gaineddistinction during his own lifetime, as a poet and a translator of poeticalworks. His father Sir Thomas Stanley was the author of some prose and poeticalfragments, but never attained the recognition that came to his illustrious son.The Thomas Stanley, with whom we are directly concerned, was born inHertfordshire, England in 1625. His early education was under the personaldirection of William Fairfax, son of the translator of Tasso, the 16th centuryItalian poet. While still young, Stanley became a good classical scholar, withfluency in French, Italian and Spanish languages.When Stanley went to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, Fairfax accompanied him. Stanleygraduated from Cambridge with the degree of Master of Arts in 1641, and took upresidence in the Middle Temple, where he combined the practice of law with hisstudies of philosophy and the classics, and the composition of poetry. Duringthe Civil War he apparently considered it discreet to travel on the continent,where he devoted himself principally to his literary projects. Stanley died inLondon on April 12, 1678.If it seems extraordinary that Thomas Stanley could have studied in bothCambridge and Oxford and graduated at the age of sixteen, it should be notedthat he entered Cambridge in his fourteenth year, apparently having receivedmost of his fundamental education by private tutoring. Actually, he issued thefirst volume of The History of Philosophy in 1655, when he was only thirty yearsold. The engraved frontispiece [reproduced here on page 17 [pre.xhtml#page_17]]shows Stanley as a young and handsome man, with long hair hanging on hisshoulders. His son of the same name was also educated at Pembroke Hall and atthe age of fourteen made a translation of Aelian's Various Histories, whichpassed through three editions.The History of Philosophy was issued in sections between 1655 and 1662. It wasreprinted complete in one large folio volume in 1687, and this is referred to asthe second edition. There was a third edition in 1700, and a fourth (whichincluded a life of the author) in 1743. Parts of the work were translated intoLatin and French. The present text was taken from the edition of 1687. At thebeginning of the section devoted to Pythagoras is an engraved portrait of thephilosopher. [See frontispiece.]Stanley's account of the Italic Sect is compiled from most records preserved byancient authors and draws heavily upon the historical writings of DiogenesLaertius, who flourished in the 3rd century A.D. Stanley's account of thePythagorian system is quite extensive, covering nearly one hundred double columnpages, in folio. It is divided into convenient headings under which relatedmaterial is organized in proper sequence. Very little of basic importance can beadded to Stanley's compilation, and writings on Pythagoras are few and for themost part difficult to secure.In order to make Stanley's text available at a time when there is considerabledemand for authentic information on the Pythagorian philosophy, it seemsdesirable that Stanley's contribution should be republished. The earliereditions, though not listed as great rarities, are extremely difficult to find,and demand has long exceeded the supply.There are other books which are useful to the study of the Pythagoreanphilosophy. One of these is the Theoretic Arithmetic, compiled by Thomas Taylor.On the title page of this volume, Taylor describes his book as “Containing thesubstance of all that has been written on this subject by Theo of Smyrna,Nicomachus, lamblichus, and Boetius.” Only one hundred copies of this book wereissued in London in 1816. It is so rare that I reprinted the volume in 1934, andthis reprint is also long out of print. Taylor also translated the Life ofPythagoras by lamblichus. This first appeared in London in 1818 and there havebeen several reprints.It seems to me that Stanley's study of the Italic Sect will interest severaltypes of readers. It has been said that Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato excelledall the other Greeks in their contributions to the enlightenment of mankind.Orpheus was the divine theologian, Pythagoras the great scientist, and Plato theinspired philosopher. The Orphic Mysteries have descended to us only in the formof hymns and fragments of mystical rituals. Very little has survived of theauthentic writings of Pythagoras, and his words have been preserved mostly asquotations in the writings of other ancient scholars. Most of the dialogues ofPlato have descended to this present time, but it remained for theNeo-Platonists to restore the esoteric parts of his teachings.images [images/17.png]On August 20, 1955, special observances were held on the Island of Samos tohonor the 2,500th. Anniversary of the founding of the first school of Philosophyby Pythagoras. A special set of four postage stamps was issued, two of whichcontained reproductions of a Samian coin depicting Pythagoras. Another stampshowed a map of Samos, and there was a third design featuring the celebrated47th Proposition of Euclid, now generally referred to as the PythagoreanTheorem.In the Ceramicus in Athens, Greece, there stands a monument popularly believedto be the Tomb of Pythagoras. A white limestone shaft is supported by a platformof four receding squares. The monument has been the subject of considerablespeculation by those concerned with Pythagorean symbolism.While it is obvious that many doctrines have been attributed to Pythagoras uponvery slender evidence, it is also true that he was an original thinker, whoseconcepts strongly influenced the course of all Western learning. We believe thatthe republishing of Stanley's researches may assist in defining the actualboundaries of Pythagorean religious, philosophical and scientific speculations.Of special interest, are the philosophical disciplines which he taught, andwhich have continued to have exponents even to the present time. His theories onsymbolic numbers have inspired countless books on numerology and divination bysuch devices as the wheel of Pythagoras, described by the English Rosicrucianwriter Robert Fludd in his De Numero et Numeratione. There is also a GreekCabala, by which numbers are substituted for the letters of the Greek alphabet.These numbers are then involved in an esoteric system similar to JewishCabalism. Godfrey Higgins goes into considerable detail on this subject in hismassive work Anacalypsis.In these days of unrest, the political thinking of Pythagoras and hiscontributions to practical philosophy are most timely. There has long been aninterest in those theories of the Pythagoreans which are primarily concernedwith problems of health. Here also many little known beliefs, traceable to thePythagorean School, are set forth. There is also a brief discussion of thedescent of the Pythagorean School and later scholars, who are known to have beenin legitimate descent from the Master.So far as is known, there is no surviving likeness of Pythagoras. A small Samiancoin is considered a possible portrait, but this is found in such poor conditionthat it gives no idea of the great philosopher's appearance. He is nearly alwaysrepresented as bearded and of noble appearance, and is sometimes accompanied bya bear. The portrait in my book The Secret Teachings of All Ages, is a compositeof traditional likenesses.Dr. Oliver, who issued several important volumes on Masonic Symbolism, notes inhis posthumously published work The Pythagorean Triangle, that Justin Martyr(100-165?), an early Church Father, approached a Pythagorean teacher and soughtto enter his school. He was rejected, however, because he lacked properqualifications in geometry, astronomy and music.The Life of Pythagoras by M. Dacier, translated into English in 1707, andincluding a translation of the “Golden Verses,” translated from the Greek by M.Rowe, Esq., is worthy of careful study. It includes the elaborate commentariesof Hierocles, who seems to have been an Alexandrian Neoplatonist. On the titlepage of Dacier's book is the same Samian coin reproduced on the Greek stamp of1955.images [images/19.png]Bronze coins naming Pythagoras, and showing him placing a wand against acelestial globe, were issued on the island of Samos during the 2nd and 3rdcenturies A.D.From M. Dacier, The Life of PythagorasThe distinguished Masonic scholar, General Albert Pike, thus summarizes thedeeper learning that arose in the Golden Age of the Hellenic States: “Among theGreeks, the scholars of the Egyptians, all the higher ideas and severerdoctrines on the Divinity, his Sovereign Nature and Infinite Might, the EternalWisdom and Providence that conducts and directs all things to their proper end,the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence that created all things, and israised far above external nature—all these loftier ideas and nobler doctrineswere expounded more or less perfectly by Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Socrates,and developed in the most beautiful and luminous manner by Plato, and thephilosophers that succeeded him.” (See Morals and Dogma).We sincerely trust that the republication of Thomas Stanley's history of thePythagorean sect will be of practical use to the many students of Greek learningand the societies dedicated to the study of the Pythagorean writing. In hisbiographical article, S. Austin Allibone summarizes the value of the History ofPhilosophy by Stanley in these carefully chosen words: “To those who would makea vast parade of learning at little expense, it is of great utility.”"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONDR. HENRY L. DRAKEAfter many centuries, Pythagoras' name still flares across the conscious horizonof learned men. He was a polydynamic figure whose encyclopedic understandinginfluenced the ancient world in a strange and powerful way. Born in Samos about580 B.C., the impact of his life and work is felt, even today, in the areas ofscience, mathematics, music, religion, mysticism, and philosophy. The world hasnot heard the last of Pythagoras, but there is a record as to how we first heardof him. His father Mnesarchus, engraver of rings, with his wife Parthenis,visited the oracle of Delphi and were told that she would bear a son who wouldexcel in grace and wisdom.This early sage was accepted by some as a Hero, meaning that he was, indeed, avirtuous man who possessed divine powers. He was regarded as one who had come toearth for the specific purpose of enlightening mankind. He sought to produce anadvanced type of human being—the insightful, creative man of character,inquiring mind, depth of feeling, thoughtful disposition, practicalunderstanding, and above all, spiritual sensitivity.According to Pythagoras each individual has within his basic nature certainqualities which, when cultivated under proper instruction, make it possible forhim to mature into the likeness of a divine being. Manly P. Hall states,“Pythagoras believed that ultimately man would reach a state where he would castoff his gross nature and function in a body of spiritualized ether…From this hewould ascend into the realm of the immortals, where by divine birthright hebelonged.”Pythagoras chose to reveal his deeper meanings only by the spoken word. If heleft any writings they have been lost. What we know of him derives mainly fromhis disciples, the Pythagoreans. His chief biographers, among them Porphyry,Iamblichus, and Diogenes Laertius, wrote of Pythagoras several hundred yearsafter his demise. Plato and Aristotle left us meaningful insights about thePythagoreans. Plato's significant dialogues the Phaedo and Timeaus are deeplyinfluenced by Pythagorean ideas and ideals. Plato, speaking of Pythagoras, saysthat he taught his disciples, “A way of Life.” They so revered him that, afterhis death, none ever took credit for any Pythagorean theory or discovery, butreferred them to The Master, or That Man, as they called Pythagoras, thusevidencing their esteem for his greatness.Vagueness surrounds the life and work of Pythagoras as well as his affirmedcharismatic nature. It is appropriate to ponder what significant difference, ifany, this makes. He, as with other great teachers, taught a meaning common toall mankind. The fact of Christ's existence, or the exact words of Buddha, issecondary to the significant truth inherent in the message they portrayed.Pythagoras' message is as vital now as it was then as a way for man to follow inpursuing and developing his own being and well-being. The message is that whatone man has done each man can do. This Pythagoras taught, stressing that eachmust attain integration of his soul for himself, since there is no vicariousattainment. Legitimate integration comes only from a depth of commitment to andan insightful understanding and application of fundamental, Divine principleswhich, being scientific, are the same for all mankind.During Pythagoras' youth, he was recognized for temperance, serenity,gentleness, prudence, and for his abilities generally. Even at this age, he wasrespected and honored. His discourse attracted many, including significantpersons, so that some said this man must be the son of a deity, perhaps Apollo.Coming to knowledge, and understanding its functioning within himself, heattended to those endeavors which aided him in comprehending reality. Hisabilities to relate with others, and “Living like some good genius,” causedworthy reports regarding him to spread. Men of insight such as Thales, Bias, andmany others, took note of him, and he came to be called, the “fair-hairedSamian.”As Pythagoras matured, he was regarded as comely, and his presence was one ofpower and awesomeness. Recognizing his own power, he was ever mindful of hismanner of speaking, for a reproach from him, would to some, be like death. Inhabits he was modest, partaking little of food and drink, and often, only ofhoney. He cared not only for the body, but for the emotion, and mind as well. Hewas not subject to excess and, “No man ever saw him rejoice or mourn.” Hecomposed his soul with the Lyre, and strove to maintain harmony within hisbeing. He would walk with small groups of companions in groves or temples whichwere pleasant and remote from the confusion of daily living. When the tyrantPolycrates came to power, Pythagoras realized that under such a government hecould not pursue learning or disseminate his findings. It was then that he lefthis country to found his Academy in Crotona.At an advanced age, Pythagoras married Theano, a disciple and a good woman.After his death, she assisted with the government of the school. Of thismarriage, seven children are mentioned, three sons and four daughters. Onedaughter, Damo, is said to have been left the writings of her father forsafekeeping with the admonition, to which she was faithful, that she, at nocost, should communicate them to anyone outside of the family. Some maintainthat Pythagoras left nothing in writing; others even name works ascribed to him,for instance, The Sacred Discourse, and The Magical Virtues of Herbs. Among themany men influenced by The Master are: Plato, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius,Julian, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinus, and Francis Bacon.Pythagoras' instruction came from his contact and studies with the wise of manycountries, and from the unfoldment of his own inner being. He first voyaged toTherecydes. It was from the mentor Anaximander that he learned of nature'ssecrets. He was a disciple of Pherecydes and a student of Hermodanias. Before heestablished himself at Crotona, in Southern Italy, it is possible that hevisited Phoenica, Palestine, Chaldea, Persia, Arabia, and India. His wish fortruth also determined him to venture a voyage to Egypt, where, with the aid ofKing Amasis, he became acquainted with the priests of Heliopolis and Memphis.These priests, not prone to share their wisdom with strangers, and wishing totest Pythagoras, confronted him with the most difficult disciplines.Nevertheless, he gained their confidence and was finally accepted into theMysteries of Isis, at Thebes.In Babylon the Magi received Pythagoras kindly and initiated him into theirarcanum, including music, the mathematical sciences, and sublime methods ofworshiping the gods. He learned of the motions of the stars and their effectsupon the nativities of men. The Magi also shared their remedies for manydiseases, and taught him the principles ruling the Universe. It was here toothat he came to know the Zoroastrians.While in India, Pythagoras visited the Brahmans. These worthy priestscommunicated deep insights to Pythagoras regarding aspects of the mind, natureof the soul, means of solving the vicissitudes of life, and methods by which manbecomes a positive agent in his own evolutionary process. He was allowed toshare in profound doctrines taught at Elephanta and Ellora.Pythagoras was also instructed by the Rabbis regarding the inner traditions ofMoses. He went to Crete and Sparta to learn the renowned laws of Minos andLycurgus. In Phoenicia the significance of the Adonic mysteries were conferredupon him. He learned all there was to know from the Greek philosophers, and wasprobably an initiate of the Eleusinian mysteries. The probability of thesetravels is strengthened in that such journeys were possible, travel was the bestmanner of acquiring knowledge, and Pythagoras' teachings were influenced byoriental philosophy and mysticism.When Pythagoras returned to Samos, he lived in a cave outside of the city, thathe might devote himself to developing his philosophy and way of life. He was nowregarded by his countrymen with even greater admiration than before, for heseemed to them even wiser and more majestic. He was asked to instruct them inthe deeper meaning of what he had learned, especially regarding the symbolic wayto knowledge.It appears that Pythagoras was, indeed, one of those dedicated to clarifying forman the real purpose of existence. Penetrating mind and conviction of feelingmay ponder well the validity of the opinion that esoteric meanings existed inearly times and, having been passed on from master to disciple, have beenperpetuated even to us, and, living on, operate constructively in various waysand at many levels.Admission to Pythagoras' Academy was by choice and by trial. The choice wasselective and the trials difficult, for this was not a school where instructionwas sold. The Pythagoreans did not “…open their souls like the gates of an inn,to everyone that came to them.” There is another sense in which the instructionwas not open. Pythagoras' lectures were delivered from behind a screen, and wereveiled in language to be fully understood only by the most advanced disciples.In this manner the esoteric instruction was perpetuated and kept pure, as wasthe case with mystery schools.Before admission to the Academy, Pythagoras would know the petitioner: hisrelations with parents, friends, and associates, the appropriateness of hislaughter, silence, and manner of discourse, his handling of anger, passion, andambition, his capacity for joy and grief, and what caused these sentiments. Allelements of the personality were seriously appraised.Included in the prerequisites was the severe probation of five years silence,which assured poise under difficult circumstances. To those who were to knowphilosophy, science, and the mysteries, a reason for silence was given: “Thatthe soul might be converted into herself from external things, and from theirrational passions in her, and from the body, even into her own life, which isto live forever.” Again, he who is silent hears what is said. Profundity is tostop talking and to learn to meditate. “We ought either to be silent, or tospeak things that are better than silence.” A stone thrown at random is moreworthy than speaking an idle word. In communication use few words, and say much.Pythagoras would observe the countenance and bearing of the petitioner and, fromthis, determine many things he desired to know. If the person was founddesirable—a lover of knowledge, capable of learning, retaining, and followingwhat he would be taught—he was admitted. Otherwise, he was summarily dismissed.The mind alone sees and knows. Hence, it must be freed of the fetters which havehampered it since infancy. In no other way can it comprehend what is true, orperceive if the senses are functioning properly. Thus, once disciples wereaccepted, Pythagoras assisted them with many exercises for the purification ofmind and soul, especially the strengthening of will.Pythagoras advised his disciples that it is best to commence one's day in silentmeditation, and thus compose one's own soul. He felt that meditation placed onein the presence of powerful constructive and directive forces. This practice hehimself pursued, often retiring into the desert for the purpose, though heplaced no merit upon solitude as such.There were also disciplines such as abstinence regarding food and sleep,temperance, and not being attached to honors. Important too, was their strictrule of secrecy concerning speaking of their more profound doctrines withoutsiders, nor did they accept, without caution, the opinion of others. Thehearts and minds of the uninitiated are not prepared for basic instruction and,“The goods of wisdom ought not to be communicated to those whose soul is notpurified.” The Master admonished his disciples not to conceal faults with words,but amend them with constructive action, and to appreciate one who legitimatelyreproves us, for this leads to improvement through self-discovery. He maintainedthat it is better to lie on the ground with settled and calm nature, than to lieupon a golden bed and be troubled. No man is free who cannot command himself.Only the most dedicated disciple could pass Pythagoras' means of testing. Yet,the procedures for qualification and purification were indispensable for thosewho desired to know That Man.It was at Crotona, a seaport of much wealth and commercial activity, thatPythagoras, about the year 529 B.C., established his Academy. It was a secretscientific-religious brotherhood. The school prospered with centers of thesociety developing in other parts of the known world. The number of disciplesand auditors numbered several hundred. The more serious students were dividedinto the classes of Probationers or Exoterics, and Mathematicians or Esoterics.To attain advancement in this academy, it was required that science, especiallymathematics and astronomy, be mastered as subjects best fitted for theenlightenment of man. The disciples needed also to deepen their religiousinsights, master their feelings, and purify their souls, thus mitigating thenecessity for rebirth.Wisdom results when the intellect is so integrated as to partake in intuitivecognition of vital causes. Pythagoras taught that with developed capacities onemay comprehend and become a part of creative principles by relating to them withone's inner being. He accepted the reality of a constant interchange of energiesand consciousness between the universe and man. Man and his greater environmentare related as microcosm and macrocosm, and at no point in time or space isthere a break in continuity, no dichotomy. Again, true wisdom is hidden from theprofane and must be discovered by looking, not outward, but inward. Therein isto be revealed all that man will ever know.The Master was accredited the ability to communicate to each disciple what wasmost proper for him to know at a particular time. Not being alike, it is fittingthat they not partake alike. The distinction between Exoteric and Esotericdisciples was significant, for the latter were entitled to an inner instructionin which the others were not privileged to partake. This distinction had to dowith the difference between the lesser and greater initiations, between lesserpreparatory concerns, and complete consecration.By degrees, the serious disciple experienced a transition from the mundane tothe contemplation of incorporeal elements in nature. Gradually, the eye of themind turned inward toward the realization of eternal principles which do notchange and which, when partaken of, make man wise. Pythagoras believedmathematics capable of abstracting the soul from sensibles, preparing it forintellectual and emotional ascension, and making it possible to intuit thingsinherent in Divine mind. The Master, “Seeing that they could not in wordsexpress incorporeal forms and first principles, had recourse to demonstration byNumbers,” realizing that God himself is the number of numbers. Without masteringmathematics, the disciple could never become a Pythagorean. Men usually knowwhat they want, but seldom what they need. Pythagoras assisted his discipleswith the needs required by nature to comprehend the meaning and purpose of life.The Pythagorean community was an unusual experiment in human relations. Itcomprised a close membership adhering to strictly prescribed rules, which theyregarded as reversed ordinances. The brothers were thus united in a commonpurpose. A friend, they held to be another self. With the understanding, derivedfrom Pythagoras, they established true friendships, with the depth of hismeaning becoming practical reality. They were aware that friendship symbolizesthe good that exist between God and man, soul and body, and man and woman,binding all relations together. The brothers recognized too that discord,wherever appearing, is the cause of dissension and disintegration.In this society personal possessions meant nothing. The brothers saw no point inaccumulating personal wealth, seeing that overabundance is as pointless assevere need. Upon entering the society, everything that a brother owned becamethe common property of all, for the best interest of each. Should one leave thesociety, he took with him the estate he brought. The brothers would then erect atomb for him, as if he were dead. Thus they outgrew egoistic interest, whichcould never promote the principles for which they stood.Pythagoras advised his disciples not to rise from their beds after sun up.Rather, they must be about their duties and, as the sun rose, see therein theimage of God. He instructed them never to do anything they had not firstpremeditated. He had no approval for the student who made an appointment andthen broke it, and disregarded one who broke a vow. In relating, the student wasto speak clearly, constructively, and directly. Moderation in all things wasdemanded, for an excess, even of virtue, can be a vice.Notwithstanding Pythagoras' severe disciplining, his disciples accepted hisdirectives without question, for they respected That Man. They looked upon him,not as an ordinary human being, but as one, who possessing godly aspects, was ina class between man and the gods. No mere human, they felt, could accomplishsuch things as he had achieved. They recognized that when he spoke, the aim wasto cure, for he regarded teaching as the highest form of preventive and curativetherapy.In directing the Academy, Pythagoras established additional procedures for thestrengthening of soul and body. Included was the practice of piety, morality,temperance, obedience, government, fidelity, and respect for law. Instructionalso entailed the structure and meaning of the world soul, the universe, and thelaw of cause and effect which makes one see that he will reap what he deserves.Religious insights, along with natural mysticism, were stressed, for Pythagorassaw that one must align with God and the gods as principles, or spiritualdevelopment would be stultified. Man is never to assume that he has beenoverlooked by God and the gods, who are his agents, for man is always undertheir supervision.The curriculum also included harmony, music, the dance, gymnastics, and properdiet. Having discovered harmony, Pythagoras applied it to order body and soul.By music the manner and passions may be modified to produce health. Through theappreciation of music, angers, griefs, fears, and various desires were exorcisedand directed toward virtue. There were melodies for evening relaxation, andothers that roused the energies. Pythagoras had music within himself, andapplying the ears of his soul to the inner harmony of the world, used it toheal. On one occasion a murder was prevented by the introduction of quietingmusic. The dance was practiced as conducive to agility of body and health ofsoul. In healing, poultices and potions from herbs were frequently used.Physical and psychological therapy, by means of color and verse, as those of theOdyssey and Illiad, were well known to the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras' effortswere spent in the process of unfolding, developing, and deepening the naturalpotentials of those he accepted for instruction. He saw his disciples andhimself as conscious parts of a universal, vital, moving process, and advisedall to cooperate with this process, since it involves an inevitable necessity.The Master taught that, “A man must be made good, then a god.” In the order ofascent, the attainment is first made by achieving in daily life, from hence,under instruction, one comes gradually to comprehend, and then to resemble theDivine. He concluded that, most important of all, a man must inform his soulconcerning what is good and what is ill, for one is good only when he knows andpractices the good. Everyone is destined eventually to know universals, not withthe physical eye, but by intellectual and intuitive insight. Then, as The GoldenVerses say, man stripped of flesh is freed to higher ether: “A deathless Goddivine, mortal no more.”The Master maintained that philosophy has to do with real things. He means realessences, incorporeal and eternal realities. All other things are what they areby participating in these realities. Such is the nature of material things,which are corruptible. Science, he points out, has to do with corporeals and notwith essentials, and the knowledge of particulars must always follow the scienceof essentials, or universals. In consciousness, he who understands universalswill also understand particulars, but not the reverse.Pythagoras was practical with his philosophy, for he held it to be in vain ifincapable of curing man's passions. As medicine cures the body, there is nobenefit in philosophy unless it expels the diseases of the soul. What then arethe anchors, the helpers, of the soul? He answers: Wisdom, Magnanimity, andFortitude, for the virtues are solid, the rest are trifles.Progress at the Academy actually amounted to a series of initiations. The mostsignificant phase of instruction concerned the fundamental concept that numberis the essence of things—that everything is essentially number. Authoritiesdisagree as to how this concept is to be understood. Aristotle's opinion is thatthe two ways of viewing numbers namely as primal essences, or as the symbols ofexistence, do not exclude one another. The principle explanation maintains thatnumbers are the Form, the very essence and meaning of things, and do not existapart from things. Number per se was presented as the quality of things, as thesubstance and law which holds the universe together. So powerful was thisconcept that it was further stated that number rules over gods and men and aretherefore, the condition and definition of knowledge.All numbers are divisible into either Odd, or Even, which are the universalconstituents of numbers and of things. A third class was accepted, namely, theOdd-Even. The Odd was identified with the Limited, while the Even was associatedwith the Unlimited. All things partake of the Limited and the Unlimited, theLimited to be equated with the perfect, and the Unlimited with the imperfect. Inaddition to these opposites, there were the One and Many, Right and Left,Masculine and Feminine, Rest and Motion, Straight and Crooked, Light andDarkness, Good and Evil, Square and Oblong. Certain meanings were also assignedto each of these categories. The Pythagoreans felt it to be observable that eachthing contains within itself these opposite characteristics.Regarding first principles, Pythagoras taught that from the opposition of Unityand Duality, other opposites may be deduced, such as: Spiritual and Corporeal,Form and Substance, and Deity and Matter, which is itself derived from Deity asthe original Unity. Unity is the condition of all beginning, and from it aroseinfinite Duality. Unity and Duality produced numbers and, from these, points,and other mathematical and geometrical forms. Unity is the efficient or movingcause of things. Duality is fundamental matter out of which, when impressed byUnity, creation is produced. The Neo-Pythagoreans regarded Unity as the One andcorrelated it with Deity, a formless Form lying beyond all opposites as thecause of causes. Duality is to be identified with diversity, as the fragmentorof Being.The opposites are held together by Harmony, present in each thing, as theunifier of the many which brings discord into accord. Pythagoras assignedspecial importance to this principle, seeing that it was a necessary conditionof each discrepant unit of being: for instance, it is inherent in musicalstructure, and in the constitution of individuals.To understand Pythagoras we cannot minimize his preoccupation with numbers andtheir application to specific concepts and objects. His theory applies specificnumbers to everything, both animate and inanimate—for example, to man, plant,and earth. He also applied numbers to concepts: two is equated with opinion,four with justice, five with marriage, seven with timeliness.The decad was regarded as the inclusive, culminating, sacred number. ThePythagoreans, therefore, divided the universe into ten spheres: first was thecircle of the Divine Fire, then the seven spheres of the planets, the earth, andAntichthon, which they proposed as a counter earth. This we never see, since itsmotion always keeps it at 180° from the earth, kept from view by the sun. Theyconceived of the heavenly bodies, not so much as physical bodies, but as energycenters, serving as agencies through which Divine intelligence expresses.The Tetractys, representing universal forces and processes, forms a pyramid bythe use of 10 dots. It was the most revered symbol of the Pythagoreans. Toconstruct the figure, four dots are used to form the base, three are placedabove these, and then two upon them, and finally one. The one is unity, the two,diversity, the three, equilibrium, while the four is the smallest number oflines that can enclose a square.Pythagoras draws attention to the properties of the ten basic numbers:1. The Monad, accepted before all others, because having no diversity, it isalways the same;2. The Duad, the audacious, because the first to separate from the One;3. The Triad, because it grows out of the Duad, or great mother and the Monad,or divine father;4. The Tetrad, because it provides the foundation of structure;5. The Pentad, or equilibrium, because it divides ten into equal halves;6. The Hexad, because it comprises the form of forms, and concerns theperfection of parts;7. The Heptad, because it is the number of life and law;8. The Ogdoad, because it symbolizes counsel, prudence, and love;9. The Ennead, because it contains the first square of an odd number (3 × 3),and entails boundary or limitation;10. The Decad, because it is the most inclusive, number, involving allarithmetic and harmonic possibilities.From the first ten numbers all others were created, since these involve thenature of all numbers.Pythagorean metaphysics teaches that creation was the result of a central fireformed in the center of the universe. This fire is the One, or Monad andtherefore, is good. It is the moving principle of all, including the gods andheavenly bodies. Pythagoras was convinced that the central fire always was;hence, it was not appropriate to speculate upon a beginning of this first cause.As the objects of time and space were regarded mathematically, so the centralfire was regarded dynamically. It is the spirit or soul of individuals, as wellas of the universe, and is fused throughout the entirety of Being.The stars are highly evolved phases of the universe, having everything that theearth has, except more perfect. Pythagoras discovered Venus to be both a morningand evening star. He knew the motion of the heavenly bodies, and was aware ofthe unchangeable regularity of their orbits. In this he saw something divine.From the revolution of heavenly bodies he arrived at his theory of a universalyear.The heavenly bodies give off a sound which the Pythagoreans called the harmonyof the spheres. The tones produced by these bodies is in relation to their size,distance, density, and movement. As the planetary system produces a harmony, sotoo does the universe in its entirety, and as living creatures breathe, so dothe planets and the universe.In the Pythagorean schema the universe entails three levels of being, whichcorrelate with three levels of consciousness. There is the Supreme World, theSuperior World, and the Inferior World. The Supreme is the highest, a subtlespiritual essence. The Superior World is that of essential principles such asNumbers and Ideas, and is the abode of the immortals. The Lower World isinhabited by those creatures which partake of material substance. The Supremeworld contains within itself the nature and capacity of the lesser two.Human souls, requiring experience which will eliminate ignorance, take onbodies. The soul, however, must discover how to extract itself from matter, orbetter, to incorporate the principle of matter into itself. As long as itexperiences on the earth plane, it requires a body through which to function.Separated from the body, the soul in the other world experiences the exact sortof life it has set up for itself by causes established during its earthlyexistence. The later Pythagoreans regarded man's soul as a part of the worldsoul and, for this reason, considered it divine and imperishable. Another reasonfor this is that soul has its number and harmony, both of which areimperishable.The Pythagoreans also believed in Daemons. At times these forms appear to menand assist in directing the processes of their lives. They may, in fact, as mayman himself, be regarded as agencies or facilitators of a purposeful plan extentin the world process. The Daemons in consciousness stand midway between man andthe gods. Man is under divine direction, and cannot accomplish histransformation to the Hero state without the help of the Daemons, gods, and God.To achieve this greatest good, man must follow the order and spirit of Nature,rather than the dictates of irrationality, and emotional abandonment. Therefore,it is one's duty to purify the soul, and not to depart earthly responsibilitiesof one's own accord.Of Pythagoras' Golden Verses, his cryptic way of presenting important truths,seventy-one are recorded, exemplified by those quoted: Verses XIII-XVI read,“Observe justice in all your actions and words; neither use yourself, in anymanner, to act without reason. But always make this reflection, that it isordained by destiny for all men to die; and that the goods of fortune areuncertain; and that, as they may be acquired, they may likewise be lost.”Verses XVII-XX read, “Support with patience your lot, be it what it will, andnever repine at it; but endeavor what you can to remedy it. And consider thatfate does not send the greatest portion of these misfortunes to good men.”Verses XL-XLIV read, “Never suffer sleep, to close your eyelids, after going tobed—till you have examined by reason, all your actions of the day. Wherein haveI done amiss? What have I done? What have I omitted that I ought to have done?If in this examination, you find that you have done amiss, reprimand yourselfseverely for it, and if you have done any good, rejoice.”Verses LIX-LX read, “Likewise know, that men draw upon themselves their ownmisfortunes voluntarily, and of their own free choice, wretches as they are!They neither see, nor understand, that their good is near them. There are veryfew of them who know how to deliver themselves out of their misfortunes. Such isthe fate that blinds mankind, and takes away their senses. Like huge cylinders,they roll to and fro, always oppressed with ills without number. For fatalcontention is innate in them and pursuing them everywhere, tosses them up anddown, nor do they perceive it. Instead of provoking and stirring it up, theyought to be yielding to avoid it.”At times, Pythagoras taught by means of aphorisms, some of which follow:“Decline from public ways, walk in unfrequented paths,” meaning that wisdom mustbe sought in solitude; “Assist a man in raising a burden, but do not assist himin laying it down,” meaning that the diligent merit assistance, but the indolentdeserve no help; “Having departed from your house, turn not back, for the furieswill be your attendants,” meaning that once the disciple sets foot upon the pathof truth, he must not turn back to former ignorant ways, which will only causeconfusion and suffering.According to our informants, Pythagoras was known for his prophecies andmiracles. His very presence was surrounded by a charismatic splendor. One reportstates that Pythagoras, while walking from Sybaris to Crotona, came uponfishermen and told them the exact number of fish they would have in their nets.The fishermen said that, if this be true, they would do whatever he commanded.When the fish were counted there were exactly the number foretold. Pythagorasrequested that the fish be returned to the sea, whereupon he paid them for theircatch, and proceeded to Crotona.Pythagoras had unusual influence upon rational and irrational creatures alike.One time, stroking a bear, which had done harm to the people, he gave her maizeand fruits and directed her not to attack living creatures. As reported, thebear went to the woods and caused no further damage to any living thing. Attimes, Pythagoras would relate what another had in mind before the other hadspoken it. He foretold earthquakes. On one occasion he predicted correctly thata certain ship, though under pleasant breeze at the time, would be wrecked. Hewas known for counteracting pestilence, and caused violent winds to cease. He isalso said to have had the ability to visit the other world and bring backreports to friends of their deceased acquaintances. Pythagoras too spoke of hisformer lives. Once he appeared, at the same time, before two of his discipleswho were at different places, and had conversation with them both. He practicedthe art of divination by numbers, and is reported to have developed a roundobject containing numbers and letters by means of which he could analyzecharacter, and predict future events.Among the achievements to be accredited Pythagoras are:1. An improved status of mathematics to a level above mere practicality byintroducing the method of axioms, postulates, definitions, and proofs;2. The discovery and proof of the angle-sum of a triangle;3. Demonstration that the square erected on the hypotenuse of a right triangleis equivalent in area to squares erected on its other two sides;4. The concept that the earth is a globe, and astronomical thoughts which ledCopernicus to affirm that from the Pythagoreans he arrived at his heliocentrichypothesis;5. Founded the harmonic science as a result of his laws yielding the fourth,fifth, and octave of a note;6. The first to use the terms philosophy, and mathematics;7. Combined geometry and arithmetic, as much later the relation between algebraand geometry was established;8. Developed the principle that numbers are the essences of all things;9. Brought to clearer focus the meaning of transmigration and the immortalityof the soul;10. Discovered a Way for man by establishing his relation to universals;11. Made prophecy and mystical experience commensurate with practical living;12. Formulated essential parts of Euclid's Elements of Geometry. Based on suchthoughts and discoveries, Pythagoras' Academy came to be recognized as the mostsignificant scientific school of the ancient world.Pythagoras died at the age of 80. His demise came as he counseled with friendsat the home of one Milo. The home was set afire out of envy by Clyo, a wealthy,prominent, but tyrannical man who, having applied for discipleship, was foundunworthy, and so refused. Others say that the Crotonians, for political reasons,perpetrated the massacre in which some forty of the brothers lost their lives.The cause may, indeed, have been political, for it cannot be denied thatPythagoras and his disciples were zealous in matters of statescraft. Theypresented directives and laws of good government to many cities so that theirmagistrates eliminated dissension from their midst. The Pythagoreans had alsoacquired a powerful influence upon the magistrates and administrations of thesecities by establishing a political conference, which amounted to promotingaristocratic government. During this time democratic trends had gained theascendancy. The result was, the Pythagoreans were persecuted.It is possible that Pythagoras, aided by his associates, escaped to Metapontum,and there died sometime later. He may have gone to the temple of the Muses, andafter forty days, passed on as a result of not having drunk or eaten during thistime. Thus ended the career of a noble and wise man, one of the greatestscientists and most prophetic of mystics the world has produced and known."},{"pageContent":"Part OneThe Life of Pythagorasimages [images/38_1.png]images [images/39_1.png]images [images/40_1.png]Among the earliest coins from Southern Italy, this silver stater of c.540–530B.C. was issued at Metaptontum, a city some ancient authorities claim to be thehome town of Pythagoras' father.

It was denominated from that part of Italy which, fromthe frequency of Greek colonies, was called Magna Graecia. Yet was not theauthor, Pythagoras, an Italian,1 [endnote.xhtml#ftn1] for though some think hisfather was of Metapontum;2 [endnote.xhtml#ftn2] some, a Tyrrhene of Etruria inItaly; yet Diogenes and others report him a Tyrrhene of the race of those whoinhabited Lemnus, Imbrus, and Scyrus.3 [endnote.xhtml#ftn3] And that coming upontraffic to Samos, he settled there and was made free. With these concursAristoxenus (to whom Clement of Alexandria joins Aristarchus and Theopompus4[endnote.xhtml#ftn4]), who says in his life of Pythagoras, that he was born inone of those islands which the Athenians won and expelled thence theTyrrhenians. Whence Suidas says that Pythagoras was a Samian, but by birth aTyrrhenian, brought over young by his father from Tyrrhenia to Samos.5[endnote.xhtml#ftn5] And indeed, his country seems inscrutable to Lycus;6[endnote.xhtml#ftn6] and to Josephus no less difficult to find out than that ofHomer.7 [endnote.xhtml#ftn7]Nor is it strange that the country of his father should be questioned, since itis not agreed concerning his name and quality.8 [endnote.xhtml#ftn8] Justincalls him Demaratus (and Johannes Sarisburiensis, from Justine, Maratus9[endnote.xhtml#ftn9]), others, Mamercus. But the greatest part of writers agree,that he was called Mnesarchus.10 [endnote.xhtml#ftn10] His profession, accordingto Hermippus and others, a graver of rings; according to others, a merchant.11[endnote.xhtml#ftn11]Some there are who affirm he was a Phliasian. Pausanias reports that he was sonof Euphron, grandson of Hippasus, who upon the taking of Phlius by the Dorians,fled to Samos. Others, that he was the son of Hippasus. Hippasus was son ofEuthyphron of Cleonymus, who was banished out of Phlius; and that Mamercus (orrather Mnesarchus) lived in Samos, whence Pythagoras was said to be a Samian.12[endnote.xhtml#ftn12] Cleanthes relates he was a Syrian, of the city Tyrus inSyria (or rather in Phoenicia), whence making a voyage to Samos for traffic, atsuch time as the Samiams were much oppressed with famine, he furnished them withcorn; in requital whereof, they made him free of their country. Hippobotus saysthat Pythagoras was a Samian.13 [endnote.xhtml#ftn13]Indeed, the most general and approved opinion is that Mnesarchus was a Samian,descended from Ancaeus, who first brought a colony into Samos. And thatPythagoras, his son, was born at Sidon in Phoenicia; but by education, as wellas extraction, a Samian also. This is ratified by the authority of Iamblichus,who begins his life with the following fabulous narration.It is reported that Ancaeus, who lived at Same in Cephalenia, was descended fromJupiter14 [endnote.xhtml#ftn14] (others say from Neptune and Astypalaea), anopinion occasioned by his virtues or some particular greatness of soul.15[endnote.xhtml#ftn15] In prudence and magnanimity he excelled all otherCephalenians. This Ancaeus was commanded by the Pythian Oracle to gathertogether a colony out of Cephalenia, Arcadia, and Thessaly, augmenting it fromAthens, Epidaurus, and Chalcis. And that having got them together under hiscommand, he should people an island, named from the richness of the soilMelamphyllos (black-leaf), and call the city which they built Samos, from Samein Cephalenia.16 [endnote.xhtml#ftn16] The Oracle was thus:Instead of Same, Samos thou (an isle)Shalt plant Aneaeus, which men Phyllas style.That this colony was drawn from those several places appears not only from theirreligious rites and sacrifices (which are derived from the countries out ofwhich those people came), but also from the affinities and mutual conventionsmade by the Samians. Mnesarchus and Pythais, the parents of Pythagoras, are saidto be descended from the family of the same Ancaeus who planted this colonythere. (Of Pythais it is confirmed by Apollonius.17 [endnote.xhtml#ftn17]) Whichnobleness of their extraction, being much celebrated amongst their countrymen, aSamian poet declared him to be the son of Apollo in these words:18[endnote.xhtml#ftn18]Pythais of all Samians the most fair,Jove-loved Pythagoras to Phoebus bare.Which report was raised thus. This Mnesarchus the Samian, being upon occasion oftraffic at Delphi with his wife, who was at that time newly with child and notknown to be so; he enquired of the Oracle concerning his voyage to Syria. TheProphetess told him that his journey should be, according to his mind, veryadvantageous. That his wife was already with child, and should bring forth a sonthat should exceed all men that ever were in Beauty and Wisdom, and through thewhole course of his life bring much benefit to mankind. Mnesarchus consideringthat the Oracle would not have spoken of his son, seeing that he demandednothing concerning him, if there were not something extraordinary to be expectedfrom him, immediately hereupon changed the name of his wife, which wasParthenis, to Pythais, from the Prophetess.And as soon as she was delivered at Sidon in Phoenicia, they called the childPythagoras. For Epimenides, Eudoxus, Xenocrates (and others mentioned byApollonius19 [endnote.xhtml#ftn19]) are to be rejected who affirm Apollo at thattime lay with Pythais,20 [endnote.xhtml#ftn20] and got her with child (she notbeing so before) and thereupon foretold it by the Prophetess. This is not to beadmitted. But that the soul of Pythagoras, being of the regimen of Apollo(whether as a follower, or some other way more near to him), was sent to mennone can doubt—since it may be evinced by these circumstances of his birth, andthe universal wisdom of his mind. This much (says Iamblichus) concerning hisgeneration. Whence we see the Greeks did so much admire his wit that theythought it could be nothing less than divine, and thereupon fabled Apollo to behis father.Pythagoras was the youngest of three sons: the eldest Cleanthes callsEunostus;21 [endnote.xhtml#ftn21] Laertius and Suidas called him Eunomus; thesecond was called Tyrrhenus. He had likewise an uncle Zoilus, mentioned byLaertius.The reasons for establishing the times concerning Pythagoras's life willhereafter be set forth upon the occasion of his going into Italy. In themeantime, I shall desire it may be admitted, that he was born about the thirdyear of the fifty-third Olympiad [ca. 562 B.C., see Glossary—Ed.]. That beingeighteen years old, he heard Thales and others. Then he went to Phoenicia,thence into Egypt, where he stayed twenty-two years; afterwards at Babylontwelve years; then returned to Samos, being fifty-six years old; and from thencewent into Italy.

He committedhim sometimes to Creophilus, sometimes to Pherecydes of Syria, and to almost allthe Prefects of the Temple, as being blessed with the fairest and most divineson that ever man had.22 [endnote.xhtml#ftn22]Some there are who affirm that Pythagoras was a wrestler;23[endnote.xhtml#ftn23] and that when Pherecydes first discoursed among the Greeksconcerning the immortality of the soul, Pythagoras the Samian, moved at thenovelty of the discourse, changed from being a wrestler to a philosopher.24[endnote.xhtml#ftn24] But these relations seem to have been occasioned byconfounding Pythagoras the philosopher with a wrestler of that name, hiscontemporary, of whom more hereafter.Cleanthes25 [endnote.xhtml#ftn25] and Suidas26 [endnote.xhtml#ftn26] relate thatPythagoras first heard Pherecydes the Syrian at Samos; and in the second placeHermodomas, images [images/45_1.png] “the Creophylian,” at the same Samos, thenvery old.27 [endnote.xhtml#ftn27] Hermodamas was his name, but he was surnamedCreophylus, wherefore perhaps instead of images [images/45_1.png] should beread, images [images/45_2.png]images [images/45_3.png]28 [endnote.xhtml#ftn28]Or else he was termed a Creophylian, as well as surnamed Creophylus,29[endnote.xhtml#ftn29] because he was reported to be descended from Creophylus, aSamian, who in times past entertained Homer as his guest, and was, as some say,his master and his rival in poetry.30 [endnote.xhtml#ftn30] But when Apuleiussays Hermodamas (or Leodamas, as he calls him) was disciple to that Creophilus,he makes an error no less in chronology than when he says Pythagoras wasdisciple of Plato, unless the whole text be corrupted.31 [endnote.xhtml#ftn31]Pythagoras, his father dying, grew up in prudence and temperance, being while hewas yet very young generally much respected and honored even by the most aged.32[endnote.xhtml#ftn32] His presence and discourse attracted all persons. Toeveryone on whom he looked, he appeared worthy of admiration, insomuch that manyaverred he was the son of a deity. He, being thus confirmed by the greatopinions that were had of him, by the education of his infancy, and by hisnatural excellence, made himself daily more worthy of these advantages. Headorned himself with devotions, with sciences, with excellent conversation, withconstancy of mind, with grave deportment, and with a sweet inimitable serenity;never transported with anger, laughter, emulation, contention, or any otherdisorder; living like some good genius come to converse in Samos. Hereupon,though young, a great report was spread of him to Thales at Miletus, to Bias atPriene—two of the sages—and to all the cities thereabout. Many in all thoseparts commending the young man made him famous, calling him by a proverb:The Samian Comer or, The fair-hair'd Samian.About this time began the tyranny of Polycrates. Pythagoras, now eighteen yearsold, foreseeing the event, and how obstructive it would prove to his designs andto the pursuit of learning, which he intended above all things, being young anddesirous of knowledge, he left his country to go to travel.33[endnote.xhtml#ftn33] He stole away privately by night, taking with himHermodamas (surnamed Creophylus, and descended, as was reported, from thatCreophylus who was host to Homer). They made a voyage to Pherecydes at Lisbus(to whom, Laertius says, he was recommended by his Uncle Zoilus); and toAnaximander, the natural philosopher; and to Thales at Miletus.With each of these he conversed severally in such manner that they all lovedhim, admired his parts, and communicated their learning to him. UnderAnaximander, the Milesian, he is said to have studied the knowledge of naturalthings.34 [endnote.xhtml#ftn34] Thales entertained him kindly; and wondering athis excellence above other youths which much surpassed the report he hadreceived, assisted him as far as he was able in sciences. Withal, accusing hisown age and infirmity, he advised Pythagoras to make a voyage to Egypt there toget acquaintance with the priests of Memphis and Diospolis.35[endnote.xhtml#ftn35] He said that of them he had learned those things for whichhe was by many esteemed wise, though he were not of such forwardness, neither bynature or education, as he saw Pythagoras to be. Whence he presaged that if heconversed with those priests, he should become the most divine and wisest ofmen.This Pherecydes fell sick at Delos. That he outlived not the fifty-seventhOlympiad [ca. 548–544 B.C.] is manifest from a letter which he wrote the daybefore his death to Thales, who died the first year of the Olympiad following.36[endnote.xhtml#ftn36] And though the greater part of authors write that at thesame time when the Cylonians in Crotona conspired against the Pythagoreans(which was not long before Pythagoras died), Pythagoras was gone from Italy toDelos to visit and bury Pherecydes—yet Dicaearchus and other more accurateauthors (says Porphyry) aver that Pythagoras was present when that conspiracybroke forth; and that Pherecydes died before Pythagoras departed from Samos.37[endnote.xhtml#ftn37] The former relation has imposed, among others, upon thelearned Salmasius, who to reconcile this with other circumstances concerningPherecydes, is constrained to imagine another person of the same name.38[endnote.xhtml#ftn38] It was therefore before Pythagoras left Samos thatPherecydes, being desperately seized by a Phthiriasis, he went to visit him andattended him in his sickness until he died. And then performed the rites offuneral as to his master.39 [endnote.xhtml#ftn39] For Laertius and Porphyry addthat after the death and burial of Pherecydes, Pythagoras returned to Samos outof a desire to enjoy the society of Hermodamus.Phavorinus, in the seventh book of his various History,40 [endnote.xhtml#ftn40]and Porphyry,41 [endnote.xhtml#ftn41] relate that after he had lived awhile withHermodamas, he first taught wrestlers—and of them Eurimenes—to diet with flesh(whereas other wrestlers used to eat dried figs, cheese-curds, and whey) wherebyEurimenes became victor at the Olympic Games. But Laertius and Iamblichusobserve that this is falsely ascribed to Pythagoras the Samian (for he allowednot the eating of flesh), but was indeed the invention of Pythagoras, son ofEratocles, of whom more hereafter.42 [endnote.xhtml#ftn42]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3HOW HE TRAVELED TO PHOENICIAHe learned of Thales above all things to husband his time. And forbearing wineand flesh, and having before refrained from eating much, he accustomed himselfto such meats as were light and easy of digestion. By such means he procured ahabit of watchfulness, clearness of mind, and an exact constant health ofbody.43 [endnote.xhtml#ftn43]He made a voyage to Sidon, as well out of a natural desire to the place itself,esteeming it his country, as conceiving that he might more easily pass fromthence into Egypt. Here he conferred with the prophets, successors of Mecus thephysiologist, and with others, and with the Phoenician priests, and wasinitiated into all the mysteries of Byblus, and Tyre, and several of theprincipal44 [endnote.xhtml#ftn44] sacred institutions in diverse other parts ofSyria. He underwent these things not out of superstition, as may be imagined,but out of love to knowledge, and a fear lest anything worthy to be known, whichwas preserved amongst them in the miracles or mysteries of the gods, mightescape him. Withal not being ignorant that the rites of those places werededuced from the Egyptian ceremonies, by means whereof he hoped to participateof the more sublime and divine mysteries in Egypt, which he pursued withadmiration as his master Thales had advised him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4HOW HE TRAVELED TO EGYPTSome Egyptian mariners passing accidentally along that coast which lies underCarmel (a Phoenician mountain where he spent much of his time in privateretirement at the Temple), willingly received him into their ship.45[endnote.xhtml#ftn45] But observing during the voyage how temperately he lived,keeping his usual diet, they began to have a greater esteem for him. Andperceiving some things in the excellence of his demeanor, more than human, theyreflected within themselves how that he appeared to them as soon as they landed,coming down from the top of the mountain Carmel (which they knew to be moresacred than other hills, and not trode upon by the vulgar), easily and directly,neither stones nor precipices obstructing his passage. And how that coming tothe side of the ship,46 [endnote.xhtml#ftn46] he asked, whether they were boundfor Egypt; and they, answering that they were, he went into the vessel, andsilently sitting down in a place where he might least disturb the mariners incase they should be in any stress.He continued in the same posture two nights and three days—without meat, drink,or sleep (except when none perceived he slumbered a little, sitting in the sameunmovable posture, and this constantly to the end). They noted how that thevoyage proceeded direct, beyond their expectation, as if assisted by thepresence of some god. Laying all these things together, they concluded andpersuaded themselves that some Divine Genius did indeed come along with themfrom Syria to Egypt. The rest of the voyage they performed prosperously,observing a greater respect then formerly in their words and actions, as well toone another as towards him, until they at last arrived upon the coast of Egyptby a most fortunate passage without any storm.As soon as they landed they reverently took him up, and seating him on thecleanest part of the sand, reared an extemporary altar before him, on which theylaid part of all the sorts of provisions which they had as the first fruits oftheir lading, and drew up their vessel in the same place where they first put tosea. Pythagoras, though weakened with long fasting, was not sick, either at hislanding or by their handling of him. Nor did he, when they were gone, abstainlong from the fruits which they had laid before him, but took them and preservedhis constitution therewith undisturbed, till he came to the next hours.47[endnote.xhtml#ftn47] From thence he went to search after all the Temples withdiligent and exact inquisition.Antiphon, in his book concerning such as were eminent for virtue,48[endnote.xhtml#ftn48] extolled his perseverance when he was in Egypt. He saidPythagoras, designing to become acquainted with the institution of the Egyptianpriests, and diligently endeavoring to participate thereof, desired Polycratesthe tyrant to write to Amasis king of Egypt—with whom he had friendship (asappears also by Herodotus49 [endnote.xhtml#ftn49]) and hospitality(formerly)—that he might be admitted to the aforesaid doctrine. Coming toAmasis, the Pharoah gave him letters to the priests.He went first to those of Heliopolis; they sent him to the priest of Memphis asthe more ancient, which was indeed but a pretence of the Heliopolitans. (For theEgyptians imparted not their mysteries to everyone, nor committed the knowledgeof divine things to profane persons, but to those only who were to inherit thekingdom; and of priests, to those who were adjudged to excel the rest ineducation, learning, and descent.50 [endnote.xhtml#ftn50]) From Memphis, uponthe same pretence, he was sent to Thebes. They, not daring for fear of the kingto pretend excuses, but thinking that by reason of the greatness and difficultythereof he would desist from the design, enjoined him very hard precepts, whollydifferent from the institution of the Grecians. These he readily performed totheir so great admiration that they gave him power to sacrifice to the gods, andto acquaint himself with all their studies—which was never known to have beengranted to any foreigner besides. Clement of Alexandria relates particularlythat he was disciple to Sonchedes, an Egyptian arch-prophet.51[endnote.xhtml#ftn51]Diogenes says that while he lived with these priests, he was instructed in thelearning and language (as Antiphon also affirms) of the Egyptians,52[endnote.xhtml#ftn52] and in their three kinds of writing: Epistolic,Hieroglyphic, and Symbolic—whereof one imitates the common way of speaking, therest allegorical by Enigmas.53 [endnote.xhtml#ftn53] They who are taught by theEgyptians learn first the method of all the Egyptian letters, which is calledEpistilographic; the second, Hieratic, used by those who wrote of sacred things;the last and most perfect Hieroglyphic, whereof one is Curiologic, the otherSymbolic.Of the Symbolic, one is properly spoken by Imitation; another is written as itwere Tropically; another on the contrary does allegorize by allusion andparable. For instance, in the hieroglyphic way, to express the Sun they made acircle; the Moon, a crescent. Tropically they do properly traduce and transferand express by exchanging some things, and variously transfiguring others. Thuswhen they deliver the praises of kings in theological fables, they wrote withembossed symbolic characters. Of the third kind, by allusion and parable, letthis be an example: All other stars, by reason of their oblique course, theylikened to the bodies of serpents; but the Sun to that of a beetle, becausehaving formed a ball of cow-dung, and lying upon its back, it rolls it about(from claw to claw). They say, moreover, that this creature lives six monthsunderground, and the other half of the year upon the earth; and that it emitsseed into the globe (of the earth) and so generates, there being no female ofthat species. Hitherto Clemens.54 [endnote.xhtml#ftn54]Thus being acquainted with the learning of that nation, and enquiring into thecommentaries of the priests of former times, he knew the observations ofinnumerable ages, as Valerius Maximus says.55 [endnote.xhtml#ftn55] And livingadmired and beloved of all the priests and prophets with whom he conversed, heinformed himself by their means accurately concerning everything; not omittingany person eminent at that time for learning, or any kind of religious rites;nor leaving any place unseen by going into which he conceived that he might findsomething extraordinary.56 [endnote.xhtml#ftn56] For he went into the adyta ofthe Egyptians57 [endnote.xhtml#ftn57] (and, as Clemens says, permitted himselfto that end to be circumcised58 [endnote.xhtml#ftn58]) and learned things not tobe communicated concerning the gods and mystic philosophy. He traveled to allthe priests, and was instructed by every one in that wherein they wereparticularly learned. In Egypt he lived twenty-two years in their private sacredplaces, studying Astronomy and Geometry, and was initiated (not cursorily orcasually) into all the religious mysteries of the gods.Laertius says he made three cups of silver and presented them to each (Society)of the Egyptian priests; which, as we said, were three: of Heliopolis, Memphis,and Thebes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5HOW HE WENT TO BABYLONAmasis, dying in the third year of the sixty-third Olympiad59[endnote.xhtml#ftn59] [ca. 522 B.C.] (which was the 223rd of Nabonasser), hisson Psamminitus succeeded him, who is by Cresias named Amistaeus. And he seemsto be the same whom Pliny calls Semniserteus60 [endnote.xhtml#ftn60] (thoughothers interpret it of Amasis61 [endnote.xhtml#ftn61]), in whose reign, says he,Pythagoras was in Egypt. At this time, Cambyses invaded and conquered Egypt,62[endnote.xhtml#ftn62] by whom Pythagoras was taken prisoner and sent to Babylon.There he lived with the most excellent among the Chaldeans,63[endnote.xhtml#ftn63] the Persian Magi (for so Cicero,64 [endnote.xhtml#ftn64]Apuleius,65 [endnote.xhtml#ftn65] and Eusebius66 [endnote.xhtml#ftn66] termthem), in respect that Babylon was then under that monarchy. This is the meaningalso of Valerius Maximus,67 [endnote.xhtml#ftn67] and Lactantius,68[endnote.xhtml#ftn68] who affirm, that he went from Egypt to the Persians (notto Persia, as some conceive69 [endnote.xhtml#ftn69]), and resigned himself tothe most exact prudence of the Magi to be formed.The Magi received him kindly, and instructed him in the most profound andsublime mysteries of the worship of the gods.70 [endnote.xhtml#ftn70] By theirmeans also he arrived at the height of Arithmetic, Music, and other MathematicalSciences. From them, says Valerius Maximus, he with a docile mind, received themotions of the stars: their power, property, and effects, their states andperiods;71 [endnote.xhtml#ftn71] the various effects of both in the nativitiesof men, as likewise the remedies of diseases, which are purchased at vast ratesby sea and land.72 [endnote.xhtml#ftn72]Of the Chaldeans with whom he lived in Babylon, Diogenes particularly mentionsZabratus, by whom he was cleansed from the pollutions of his life past, andinstructed from what things virtuous persons aught to be free, and learnt thediscourse concerning Nature (Physic), and what are the principles of theUniverse.73 [endnote.xhtml#ftn73] This Zabratus was probably the same with thatZoroastres, one of the Persian Magi, whom Apuleius says he chiefly had forteacher, terming him, Omnis divini Arcanum antistate [“Chief Priest of everyDivine Mystery”].74 [endnote.xhtml#ftn74] He was also probably the same asNazaratus, the Assyrian, whom Alexander, in his book of Pythagorean Symbols,affirms to have been master to Pythagoras.75 [endnote.xhtml#ftn75] Also the sameperson whom Suidas calls Zares;76 [endnote.xhtml#ftn76] Cyril, Zaran; Plutarch,Zaratas. Whence some conceive that they all mean Zoroastres, the Magus, who wasalso called Zarades, as evidently appears from Theodoret and Agathias.77[endnote.xhtml#ftn77] Indeed, he could not hear Zoroastres himself, as beingsome ages later; yet it appears from the relation of Apuleius, that manyconceived Pythagoras to have been a follower of Zoroastres. Perhaps him whosedoctrine Pythagoras embraced (for Clemens says he explained Zoroastres thePersian Magus78 [endnote.xhtml#ftn78]), posterity believed to have been hismaster. This Nazaratus the Assyrian was also by some supposed to be the ProphetEzekiel, which opinion Clemens disputes. Nevertheless (as Mr. Selden observes),the most accurate chronology teaches that Ezekiel and Pythagoras flourishedtogether, between the fiftieth and fifty-third Olympiad [ca. 576 to 565 B.C];and therefore the account of time hinders not, but that this Nazaratus might beEzekiel.Diogenes (in his treatise of Incredible Things Beyond Thule79[endnote.xhtml#ftn79]) adds that Pythagoras went also to the Hebrews, whichLactantius expressly denies.80 [endnote.xhtml#ftn80] Eusebius says he isreported to have heard the Persian Magi, and the diviners of the Egyptians, atthe time some of the Jews were gone to Babylon, others to Egypt.81[endnote.xhtml#ftn81] That he conversed with the Jews at Babylon (says theBishop of Armagh82 [endnote.xhtml#ftn82]) may be argued, for that he transferredmany of their doctrines into his philosophy, as Hermippus declares in his firstbook of things concerning Pythagoras, cited by Josephus.83 [endnote.xhtml#ftn83]And in his first book of Lawgivers, cited by Origen.84 [endnote.xhtml#ftn84]This is likewise confirmed by Aristobulus the Jew, a Peripatetical philosopher,in his first book to Philometor. He moreover was induced to believe that theBooks of Moses were translated into Greek before the Persian Empire;85[endnote.xhtml#ftn85] whereas it is much more probable that Pythagoras receivedthat part of his learning from the conversation which he had with the Hebrews.Alexander adds that Pythagoras heard the Galatae and the Brahmans.86[endnote.xhtml#ftn86] From Chaldea, says Apuleius, he went to the Brahmans.These are wise persons of the nation of India, for which reason he went to theirGymnosophists. The Brahmans conferred many things to his philosophy: what arethe documents of minds; what the exercises of bodies; how many are the parts ofthe soul; how many the vicissitudes of life; what torments or rewards, accordingto their merits, are allotted to men after death.Diogenes adds that he went also to Arabia and lived with the king there.87[endnote.xhtml#ftn87] But it is not easy to find the name of the court of theking of that wandering nation.As concerning his learning, it is generally said that he learned the mostexcellent parts of his philosophy of the Barbarians.88 [endnote.xhtml#ftn88]Diogenes affirms he gained the greatest part of his wisdom from these nations.The sciences which are called Mathematical, he learnt of the Egyptians, and theChaldeans, and the Phoenicians; for the Egyptians, were of old studious ofgeometry; the Phoenicians, of numbers and proportions; the Chaldeans, ofastronomical theorems, divine rites, and worship of the gods; and otherinstitutions concerning the course of life, he learned and received of theMagi.89 [endnote.xhtml#ftn89] These are more generally known, as being committedto writing; but the rest of his institution are less known.Hermippus says he embraced the opinions of the Thracians;90[endnote.xhtml#ftn90] which some interpret of Pittaeus, whose father Hyrrhadiuswas of that country.91 [endnote.xhtml#ftn91] But with more reason may it beunderstood of Orpheus, from whom Iamblichus acknowledged that Pythagoras derivedmuch of the theological part of his science."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6HOW HE RETURNED TO SAMOSHaving lived at Babylon twelve years,92 [endnote.xhtml#ftn92] he returned toSamos about the fifty-sixth year of his age (that he was redeemed by one Gyllus,Prince of Crotona, Apuleius cites but for a less creditable relation). Beingknown by some of the most ancient persons, he was looked upon with greateradmiration than before, for he seemed to them more wise, more beautiful, andmore divinely majestic. His country summoned him to some public employment thathe might benefit the generality, and communicate his knowledge. Which he, notrefusing, endeavored to instruct them in the symbolical way of learning,altogether resembling that of the Egyptians in which he himself had been taught.But the Samians not affecting this way, did not apply themselves to him.Pythagoras, though he saw that no man came to him or sincerely affected hislearning, endeavored nevertheless all possible ways to continue amongst them,not despising or undervaluing Samos because it was his country. And while he wasvery desirous that his countrymen should taste, though against their wills, thesweetness of his Mathematics, he observed in a gymnasium, a young man thatplayed at tennis dexterously and nimbly, but otherwise poor and indigent.Imagining that this youth would be wholly guided by him, if without labor heshould supply him with necessaries, when they had done washing, he called him tohim. He told him that he would continually furnish him with all thingssufficient for his maintenance, if he would learn briefly, and without labor,and constantly (that he might not be over-burdened), some Mathematics—which hehimself, when he was young, had learned of the Barbarians, which had now lefthim by reason of old age and forgetfulness.The youth promising, and being allured by the hopes of maintenance, heendeavored to initiate him in Arithmetic and Geometry, drawing the demonstrationof each in a table. And teaching him, he gave the young man for every scheme (ordiagram) three oboli as a reward and compensation. And this he continued to do along time out of a love of glory, and industriously brought him into the theoryby an exact method.But when the young man, having made a good progress, was sensible of theexcellence, both of the pleasure and the consequences in Mathematics, the wiseman perceiving it, and that he would not now quit his learning, whatinconvenience soever he might suffer, pretended, that he had no more trioboli togive him. “Tis no matter,” said the youth, “I am able to learn and receive yourArithmetics without it.” Pythagoras replied, “But I have not sufficient to findfood for myself, wherefore I must now give over to acquire necessaries foreveryday, and daily food; nor is it fit now to be taken up with tables andfruitless studies.” Whereupon the young man, loathe to be hindered fromcontinuing his learning, replied, “I will supply you, and in some manner requiteyou; for I will give you for every scheme three oboli.”And from thenceforward became so much in love with Mathematics, that he alone ofall the Samians was commended with Pythagoras, being likewise of the same name,son of Eratocles. His Aleiptiek Commentaries are extant, and his directions tothe wrestlers of the time, to eat flesh instead of dried figs—which by some arefalsely ascribed to Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchus (as was formerlyintimated), but by Pliny,93 [endnote.xhtml#ftn93] to one of that name whoprofessed exercises of the body, which agrees with the relation of Iamblichus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7TRAVELS TO DELOS, DELPHI, CRETE, AND SPARTANot long after, according to the relation of Iamblichus, Pythagoras went toDelos, where he was much admired by the inhabitants.94 [endnote.xhtml#ftn94] Forhe prayed only at the Altar of Apollo Genitor95 [endnote.xhtml#ftn95] (whichstands behind the horn altar), called unbloody, because at it were offered onlywheat, barley, and cakes,96 [endnote.xhtml#ftn96] but no victim—as Aristotlesays in his Treatise concerning the Delian Commonwealth—and applied himself tonone but the attendants thereof.From Delos, Iamblichus says he went to all places of Oracle.97[endnote.xhtml#ftn97] At Delphi he wrote an elegy upon the Tomb of Apollowhereby he declared that Apollo was son of Silenus, but slain by Pytho, andburied in the place called Trisops, which was so named for that the threedaughters of Triopas mourned there for Apollo.98 [endnote.xhtml#ftn98] At Delphialso (Aristoxenus says) he learned many moral documents of Themistoclea.99[endnote.xhtml#ftn99]He went also to Crete and Sparta to acquaint himself with the Laws of Minos andLycurgus, which at that time were much renowned, as Justine100[endnote.xhtml#ftn100] and Iamblichus101 [endnote.xhtml#ftn101] affirm.Neither was Crete less famous for religious ceremonies. It was esteemed theplace where Jupiter was born and brought up by the Corybantes—or Dactyli priestsof Cybele—in a cave of the Mountain Ida, which they so named after that ofPhrygia whence they came. They had also a tradition that Jupiter was buriedthere, and showed his tomb. Here Pythagoras addressed himself to the priests ofMorgus, one of the Idaen Dactyli, who purified him with the Ceraunian Stone (socalled in that it is conceived to be a piece of Jupiter's thunderbolt, andtherefore perhaps used by his priests102 [endnote.xhtml#ftn102]). In the morninghe lay stretched forth upon his face by the seaside; at night by a river,crowned with a wreath made of the wool of a black lamb.He also applied himself to the Cretan Epimenides, that eminent soothsayer, asApuleius calls him.103 [endnote.xhtml#ftn103] He went down with him into theIdean Cave, wrapped in black wool, and stayed there three times nine daysaccording to the custom.104 [endnote.xhtml#ftn104] He saw the throne which ismade yearly there for Jupiter, and wrote an epigram upon his tomb, beginningthus:Here Zan deceased lies, whom Jove they call.Thus was he initiated into all religious rites, Grecian as well as Barbarian.105[endnote.xhtml#ftn105]images [images/58_1.png]This silver stater was issued for Olympic Games held in the early 4th centuryB.C.—perhaps for the 98th Olympiad of 388 B.C.

Leo, admiring his wit andeloquence, demanded in what art he did most confide. Pythagoras answered, thathe knew no art, but was a philosopher. Leo wondering at the novelty of the name,asked who were philosophers, and what difference there is between them andothers? Pythagoras answered that human life seemed to resemble that publicconvention which is celebrated with the pomp and games of all Greece. For assome by bodily exercises aim at the glory and nobility of a crown; other are ledaway by gain in buying or selling. But there is a certain kind of person, andthose of the better quality, who seek neither applause nor gain, but come tobehold and curiously observe what is done, and how. So we, coming out of anotherlife and nature into this life, as out of some city into the full throng of apublic meeting—some serve glory, other riches. Only some few there are, whodespising all things else, studiously enquire into the nature of things. Thesehe called Enquirers after wisdom, that is, Philosophers.Thus, whereas learning before was called “Sophia,” Wisdom, and the prosessorsthereof, Sophoi, wisemen (as Thales and the rest of whom we treated in the firstbook), Pythagoras, by a more modest appellation, named it “Philosophy,” or Loveof Wisdom. He called its prosessors “Philosophers,” conceiving the attribute ofwise not to belong to men but to God only—that which is properly termed Wisdom,being far above human capacity.111 [endnote.xhtml#ftn111] For though the frameof the whole heaven, and the stars which are carried about in it, if we considertheir order, is fair; yet is it such but by participation of the primaryintelligible, who is a nature of numbers and proportions, diffusing itselfthrough the universe, according to which, all these things are ordered togetherand adorned decently. Wisdom therefore is a true knowledge, conversant aboutthose fair things which are first, and divine, and unmingled, and always thesame; by participation whereof, we may call other things fair. But philosophy isan imitation of that science, which likewise is an excellent knowledge, and didassist towards the reformation of mankind."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9HOW HE LIVED AT SAMOSHaving been a diligent auditor and disciple of all these, he returned home andearnestly addicted himself to enquiry after such things as he had omitted.112[endnote.xhtml#ftn112] First, as soon as he returned to Ionia (says Antiphon,cited by Porphyry, repeated and enlarged by Iamblicus), he built in his countrywithin the city a school which even yet is called the Semicircle ofPythagoras.113 [endnote.xhtml#ftn113] Here the Samians, when they would consultabout public affairs, would assemble, choosing to enquire after things honest,just, and advantageous in that place which he, who took care of them all, haderected. Without the city he made a cave proper for his study of philosophy, inwhich he lived for the most part day and night, and discoursed with his friends,and made enquiry into the most useful part of Mathematics, taking the samecourse as Minos son of Jupiter. And so far did he surpass all whom he taught,that they, for the smallest theorem, were reputed great persons.Pythagoras now perfected the science of the celestial bodies and covered it withall demonstrations Arithmetical and Geometrical. Nor this only, but he becamemuch more admired for the things he performed afterwards. For philosophy had nowreceived a great increase, and all Greece began to admire him; and the best andmost studious persons, for his sake, reported to Samos desiring to participateof his institutions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10HIS VOYAGE TO ITALYBut Pythagoras, being engaged by his countrymen in all embassies, andconstrained to be interested in their public negotiations, perceived that if heshould comply with the laws of his country and continue there, it would he hardfor him to study Philosophy. For which reason all former philosophers endedtheir lives in foreign countries.114 [endnote.xhtml#ftn114] Weighing all theseconsideration, and to avoid civil employments—or as others say, declining thenegligence of learning which at that time possessed the Samians—he departed intoItaly, preferring that place before his country, which contained most personsfervently desirous of learning.But before we speak of his actions in Italy, it will be requisite as well tosettle the time of his coming and the state of that country as it was at thattime. It was a received opinion amongst the more ancient but less learned Romansthat Pythagoras was contemporary with King Numa. The occasion of that traditionmight perhaps arise from those books which were found in the sepulcher of Numa,805 years after his death. Antius Valerius, cited by Livy,115[endnote.xhtml#ftn115] and Cassius Hemina, by Pliny,116 [endnote.xhtml#ftn116]relate these were supposed to contain Pythagorean philosophy. But that opinionis long since refuted by the more learned Romans and Grecians: Cicero, TitusLivius, Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Plutarch, and others.They who have looked more strictly into the time of Pythagoras seem to followtwo different accounts. Iamblichus says that he lived in Egypt twenty-two years;that he was carried from thence by Cambyses; that he lived in Babylon twelveyears; that from thence he returned to Samos being fifty-six years old; thatfrom Samos he went into Italy in the sixty-second Olympiad [ca. 528B.C.]—Eryxidas, a Chalcidean, being victor at the Olympic Games. From whence itfollows that he went into Egypt about the third year of the fifty-third Olympiad[ca. 562 B.C.]; and that he was born in the second year of the forty-eighthOlympiad [ca. 583 B.C.]; and that it was the fifty-second Olympiad [ca. 568-565B.C.], when he, in the eighteeenth year of his age, heard Thales, Pherecydes andAnaximander.This account seems to be followed by Laertius, Porphyry, Themistius, Suidas(from Laertius), and others, who affirm he went from Samos into Italy at thetime Polycrates was tyrant of Samos, conceiving it unfit for a philosopher tolive under such a government. For by Diodorus,117 [endnote.xhtml#ftn117]Pythagoras is acknowledged in the sixty-first Olympiad [ca. 532 B.C.], Thericlesbeing Archon; by Clement of Alexandria, about the sixty-second Olympiad [ca. 528B.C.], under Polycrates;118 [endnote.xhtml#ftn118] and in the second year of thesixty-fourth Olympiad [ca. 519 B.C.], Polycrates was betrayed and put to deathby Oroetas. This account Antilochus also seems to follow, who reckons from thetime of Pythagoras to the death of Epicurus, 312 years. Epicuras died in thesecond year of the 127th Olympiad [ca. 267 B.C.]; the 312th year upwards is thefirst of the forty-ninth Olympiad [ca. 580 B.C]. Neither is Livy much differentfrom this computation, who makes him to come into Italy, Servio Tullio regnante,who died about a year or two before. And this account might be the occasion ofmaking him live to ninety years, as Laertius says many do; and to 104 years, asthe nameless author of his life in Photius, the year of his death beingaccording to Eusebius the fourth of the seventieth Olympiad [ca. 493 B.C].But this account may, with good reason, be questioned. For if it be granted (asby Iamblichus himself, and other good authorities it is affirmed) thatPythagoras was in Egypt when Cambyses subdued it, and that he was carried awaycaptive by him into Babylon, the time of his going into Italy must of necessitybe much later. For Cambyses invaded Egypt in the fifth year of his reign, whichis the third year of the sixty-third Olympiad [ca. 522 B.C], and the 223rd yearof Nobonassar, of which there is no question in chronology. This is so becausethe seventh year of Cambyses is known to be the 225th year of Nabonassar.Ptolemy in his Almegest relates an astronomical observation of a Lunar eclipseat Babylon on the seventeenth day of the month Phamenoth, according to theEgyptians, which is with us the sixteenth of July, one hour before midnight.119[endnote.xhtml#ftn119]From whence now it follows that he if lived twenty-two years in Egypt, that thenhe went thither in the third year of the fifty-eighth Olympiad [ca. 542 B.C];and that if he stayed in Babylon twelve years; he went into Italy about the endof the sixty-sixth Olympiad [ca. 509 B.C]; and that if he were then fifty-sixyears old, he was not born before the first year of the fifty-third Olympiad[ca. 564 B.C]. And according to this account, they who make him live but seventyor eighty years, do not much differ in the time of his death from them, whoaccording to the other account, make him live so much longer. For they who givehim most years do not make him to die later, but to be born sooner.This account they seem to follow who affirm he went from Samos to Italy.120[endnote.xhtml#ftn120] For he could not brook Syloson, the brother ofPolycrates, on whom (being a private person after his brother's death) DariusHystaspis afterward bestowed the tyranny of Samos in requital of a garment whichSyloson had given him before he came to the empire. And thus perhaps is Straboto be understood. He says Pythagoras, as they reported, in the time ofPolycrates, seeing the tyranny begun, forsook the city and went from thence toEgypt and Babylon out of love to learning. And returning home, and seeing thatthe tyranny continued still, he went into Italy where he ended his days.121[endnote.xhtml#ftn121] By this “continuation of the tyranny,” seems to be meantthe reign of Syloson—who ruled so cruelly that many persons forsook the city,insomuch that it became a proverb:A Region vastBy Syloson laid waste.With both these accounts agree what Cicero122 [endnote.xhtml#ftn122] and AulusGellius123 [endnote.xhtml#ftn123] affirm concerning his coming into Italy—thatit was in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus. But to neither can that of Pliny beaccommodated. Pliny says that Pythagoras observed the nature of the star Venusabout the forty-second Olympiad [ca. 608 B.C.], which was of the city of Romethe 142nd year.124 [endnote.xhtml#ftn124] There must therefore be either anerror in both the numbers; or, which I rather believe, in Pliny himself,occasioned, perhaps by mistaking Tarquinius Priseus (under whom they both fall)for Tarquinius Superbus, under whom Pythagoras flourished.If therefore he came into Italy in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus,125[endnote.xhtml#ftn125] the opinion of Cicero is to be received. That he wasthere when Lucius Brutus freed his country; and upon the expulsion of TarquiniusSuperbus, Brutus and Lucius Collatinus were made the first consuls. At whichtime the dominion of the Romans extended not any way above six miles from theircity; and the southern parts of Italy were chiefly inhabited by the Grecians,who at several times had there planted diverse colonies, whereof we shall onlymention those which were more particularly concerned in the actions ofPythagoras.The most ancient of these is Metapontum, seated in the Bay of Tarentum betweenHeraclea and Tarentum, built by Nestor and the Pylians, a people ofPeloponnesus.126 [endnote.xhtml#ftn126] Long after were founded:Catana, a city on the east side of Sicily, between Messena and Syracuse, builtby a colony of Chalcideans, in the eleventh Olympiad [ca. 736 B.C.].127[endnote.xhtml#ftn127]Tarentum in Italy, in the eighteenth Olympiad [ca. 708 B.C.],128[endnote.xhtml#ftn128] built by the Parthenians.129 [endnote.xhtml#ftn129] Thesewere children of the Lacedaemonian women, born in the absence of their husbandsat the Messanian wars. They were therefore called Parthenians in reproach; whichnot brooking, they conspired against the Lacedaemonian people; but beingbetrayed and banished, came hither.Crotona, a city in the Bay of Tarentum,130 [endnote.xhtml#ftn130] built in thenineteenth Olympiad [ca. 704 B.C.],131 [endnote.xhtml#ftn131] by a colony ofAchaeans under the conduct of Miscellus. By whom it was named Crotona at thecommand of Hercules, in memory of Croto, his host, whom he, having unwittinglyslain, buried there. This city, for being built by the command of Hercules,engraved his figure in their coins. [See illustration next page.]Sybaris is a city distant from Crotona 200 furlongs according to Strabo'saccount—but as others conceive, more than twice so much—built at the same timeby a colony of Troezenians, under the conduct of Iseliceus, between the tworivers Crathis and Sybaris.132 [endnote.xhtml#ftn132]Locri in Italy was built in the twenty-fourth Olympiad [ca. 684 B.C.], by theLocrians, a people of Achaea.133 [endnote.xhtml#ftn133]Agrigentum,134 [endnote.xhtml#ftn134] an Ionian colony, built by the Geloans 108years after their own foundation. Gela135 [endnote.xhtml#ftn135] was built inthe forty-fifth year after Syracusa in the eleventh Olympiad [ca. 736 B.C.,forty-five years later would be 691 B.C.]: Agrigentum therefore in theforty-ninth [687 B.C.].136 [endnote.xhtml#ftn136]To these add, of less certain time, Rhegium in Calabria built by theChalcedeans, and Nimgra and Tauromenium in Sicily, colonies of the Zancleaans.Indeed so generally was the Pythagorean doctrine received in these parts, thatIamblicus affirms, all Italy was filled with philosophical persons; and whereasbefore it was obscure, afterwards by reason of Pythagoras, it was named images[images/66_2.png] Magna Graecia [“Greater Greece”].137 [endnote.xhtml#ftn137]images [images/66_1.png]Crotonian coins with images of Hercules.

Atthe beginning, the Crotonians joining with the Sybarites and the Metapontines,determined to expel the rest of the Grecians out of Italy. They first took thecity Syrus. And taking it ill that at their besieging of Syrus, the Locriansassisted the adverse party, raised a war against them, related thus byJustin:138 [endnote.xhtml#ftn138]The Locrians being terrified, recur to the Spartans for refuge, and beg theiraid. They, oppressed with a long war, bade them seek help of Castor and Pollux.Neither did the ambassadors sleight the advice of the associate city, but goinginto the next Temple, they sacrificed, and implored the help of the Gods. Havingoffered victims and obtained, as they thought, what they requested—no lessjoyful than as if they were to carry the Gods themselves along with them—theymade couches for them in the ship, and by a fortunate voyage brought comfort,instead of relief to their countrymen. This known, the Crotonians also sentambassadors to the Oracle at Delphi, praying for victory, and a happy success ofthe war. Answer is made, that enemies must be overcome in vows first, before inarms. They vowed to Apollo the tenths of the spoil.The Locrians understanding the vow of their enemies, and the answer of the God,vowed the ninths, and kept it secret less they might be outdone in vowing. Beingdrawn forth into the field, the Crotonian army consisting of 120,000 soldiers;the Locrians beholding how small a number they were (for they had but 15,000),gave over all hope of victory, and unanimously resolved to die. And so greatcourage did every man take from desperation that they conceived they should beconquerors if they did not die unwillingly. But while they sought to diehonorably, they overcame more fortunately; neither was there any other cause ofthat victory, than that they despaired of it. While they were in fight, an eaglenever left the Locrian army but flew about it all the while, until they hadgained the victory. In the wings of the army also, two young men, armed after afashion different from all the rest, of extraordinary bigness, upon whitehorses, in crimson mantles, were seen to fight; and, after the fight, were seenno more. This wonder was increased by the incredible swiftness of same; for thevery same day that this fight happened in Italy, the victory was reported atCorinth, Athens, and Lacedaemon. After this, the Crotonians used no militaryexercise, nor minded arms. For they hated what they had taken up unsuccessfully,and would have changed their life into luxury had it not been for Pythagoras thephilosopher.As soon as Pythagoras arrived in Italy and came to Crotona, Dicaearchus saysthat upon the coming of a person who was a great traveler and excellent—andthrough a peculiar advantage of nature, prosperously guided by fortune (for hewas of a free presence, tall, graceful in his speech and gesture, and in allthings else)—the citizens of Crotona were taken with him.139[endnote.xhtml#ftn139] Having won the affections of the old men, who were themagistrates of the city, he made an excellent and large discourse to the youngmen. He then, by command from the magistrates, made a second exhortation to theyoung men, and afterwards to the boys, who came flocking out of the school tohear him; and lastly to the women, assembled to that purpose. The occasion andmanner mentioned, by Plutarch and Porphyry, is related thus by Iamblichus.140[endnote.xhtml#ftn140]At this time, walking from Sybaris to Crotona, upon the sea side, he lightedupon some fishermen; and while their net was yet at the bottom loaden, he toldthem exactly the number of fishes that they should draw up. The men, undertakingto do whatsoever he should command them if it fell out accordingly, he requiredthem to turn back again the fishes alive after they had exactly numbered them.And, which is more wonderful, not one of all the number of the fishes, whilethey were out of the water, died. He being present, and giving the fishermen theprice of the fish, departed to Crotona. But they divulged what was done, and,learning his name of the boys, declared it to everyone; which they hearing,desired to see the stranger, which was opportune to him. For he was of such anaspect, that whosoever saw him could not but admire him, and conceive him to bethe person that he really was."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12HIS ORATION TO THE YOUNG MENSome few days after, he went into the public school, and the young men flockingto him, it is said that he made discourses to them wherein he exhorted them torespect their elders, declaring the following: 141 [endnote.xhtml#ftn141]That in the world, and in life, and in cities, and in nature, that which isprecedent in time is more honorable than that which is subsequent: as the eastthan the west, the morning than the evening, the beginning than the end,generation than corruption, natives than strangers. In like manner: in coloniesthe leader and planner of cities; and generally the gods than daemons, daemonsthan semi-gods, heroes than men—and of these (men), the cause of generation thanthe younger.This he said by way of induction, to make them have a greater esteem of theirparents, to whom he said they had as much obligation as a dead man might owe tohim that should raise him again to life. Moreover, that it was just to loveabove all, and never to afflict, the first and those who have done us greatestbenefits. But parents only, by the benefit of generation, are the first. Andpredecessors are the causes of all things that succeed rightly to theirsuccessors; showing, that they are nothing less beneficial to us than the gods,against whom it is not possible to offend in so doing.And the gods themselves cannot but in justice pardon those who reverence theirparents equal to them; for it is from them that we learn to worship the deity;whence Homer gives the king of the gods the same style, calling him, Father ofGods and Mortals. And many other fabulous writers have delivered that the chiefof the gods was ambitious to make up the divided love of children by a newconjunction of parents. And for this end, making a new supposition of father andmother, Jupiter brought forth Minerva, Juno, and Vulcan, of a contrary sex totheir own, that they might participate of that love which was more remote.Now all persons granting the judgment of the gods to be strongest, hedemonstrated this particularly to the people of Croto. Because that Hercules wasof affinity with them, therefore they ought willingly to obey the injunctions oftheir parents, since they understood that this god, in obedience to anotherelder than himself, underwent his labors and presented to his father, as thesong of victory of his actions, the Olympic Games.He declared likewise that in their conversation to one another, they should sobehave themselves that they might hereafter never become enemies to theirfriends, but might soon become friends to their enemies; as to their friends,they should never become enemies, but to their enemies quickly become theirfriends.142 [endnote.xhtml#ftn142] And that they should study in their behaviortowards their elders, their reverence towards their parents, and in their loveto one another, their community towards their brethren.Furthermore he discoursed concerning Temperance, saying, that young men shouldmake trial of their nature at that time in which they have their desiresvigorous. Then he advised them that it was worth their observation that thisonly virtue was convenient both for children, and maids, and women, and old men,but especially for young men. Further, this virtue only declares that theyunderstand the goods of the body and soul, seeing it preserves health, and adesire to the best studies. This is manifest from the contrary: for theBarbarians and the Grecians contending about Troy, both parties for theintemperance of one man fell into extraordinary calamities; those in the war,these in their voyage home. And God appointed ten years, and a thousandyears—only for the punishment of this injustice; foretelling by oracle thetaking of Troy, and the sending of the virgins by the Locrians to the temple ofMinerva the Ilian.He likewise exhorted the young men to love learning—telling them how absurd itwas to judge learning to be the most advantageous of all things, and to wish forit above all things, yet to bestow no time or pains in that exercise.Especially, seeing that excessive attention to the care of our bodies is likeevil friends (which soon forsake us); but that the pursuit of Instruction likethe good, which stay with a man till death—procuring to some immortal gloryafter death.He framed many other things—partly out of history, partly out ofdoctrines—showing, that learning was a common nobility of those who were firstin every kind, for their inventions were the education of the rest. Thus is thisnaturally advantageous: that of some commendable things, it is not possible tocommunicate to another—such as strength, beauty, health, courage. Of othercommendable things, whosoever imparts them to another cannot retain themhimself—such as riches, government, and the like. But for education, you mayreceive it of another, and yet the giver have nothing the less of it.Moreover, some a man cannot gain if he would. He may receive training if hewill. Then he may apply himself to the affairs of his country, not uponself-confidence, but institution. For by education, men differ from beasts,Greeks from Barbarians, freemen from slaves, philosophers from the vulgar.Further, he said that those who have in general this advantage are rare. That asof those who run swifter than others, there had been seven out of this their owncity at one celebration of the Olympic Games. But of such as did excel143[endnote.xhtml#ftn143] in wisdom, there had been found but seven in the wholeworld. And in the following times in which he lived, there was but one who didexcel all others in philosophy. For he called himself by that name (philosopher)instead of Sophos, a wise man."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13HIS ORATION TO THE SENATORSThus he discoursed to the young men in the school. But they, relating to theirFathers what he had said, the thousand men summoned Pythagoras to the court.They commended him for the advice he had given to their sons, and commanded him,that if he had anything which might benefit the people of Crotona, he shoulddeclare it to the magistrates of the commonwealth.144 [endnote.xhtml#ftn144] TheCrotonians (says Valerius Maximus) did earnestly entreat him that he wouldpermit their Senate, which consisted of a thousand persons, to use hisadvice.145 [endnote.xhtml#ftn145]Hereupon he first advised them to build a Temple to the Muses, that they mightpreserve their present concord.146 [endnote.xhtml#ftn146] For these goddesseshave all the same appellation, and have a reciprocal communication and delight,chiefly in honors common to them all;147 [endnote.xhtml#ftn147] and the chorusof the Muses is always one and the same. Moreover, concord, harmony, rhythm, allthose things which procure unanimity, are comprehended. He likewise showed them,that their power did not only extend to the excellent, but to the concord andharmony of beings.Further, he said they ought to conceive they received their country as a depositfrom their people. Wherefore they ought so to manage it as being hereafter toresign up their trust with a just account to their own children. That this willcertainly be if they be equal to all their citizens and excel other men innothing more than in justice; knowing that every place requires justice. Heshowed it out of the mythology: that Themus has the same place with Jupiter, asDice with Pluto, and law among cities. So that he who did anything unjustly inthings under his charge seemed to abuse the whole world, both above, below, andon earth.That it is convenient in courts of judicature that none attest the gods by oath,but rather always speaks such things as that he may be believed without oath.148[endnote.xhtml#ftn148]Moreover, that everyone should so govern his family as that they should referthemselves to their own house as to a court of justice. And that they should benaturally affectionate to such as are descended of them, as having only of allcreatures received the sense of this affection. And that they should conversewith the woman that is partner of their life. For as some men making contractswith others wrote them in tables and pillars; those with wives are in thechildren. And that they should endeavor to be beloved of those which come fromthem—not by nature, of which they are not the cause—but by election, for thatkindness is voluntary.That they should likewise take care, that they know no women but their wives;and that the wives do not adulterate the race through the carelessness andwickedness of their husbands.Further, they must consider they take the wife from the altar with libations, asa Votaress in the sight of the gods. And so to go in unto her. And that shebecome in order and temperance a pattern to those that live in the house withher, and to the women of the city.And that they should see carefully that none transgress, lest, not fearing thepunishments of law such as do unjustly lie hid; but having a respect to honestlyin their carriage, they may be incited to justice.Further, he commanded, that in all their actions they should avoid idleness; forthere is no other good than the opportunity in every action.He asserted that it is the greatest of Injustices to separate children andparents from each other.That he is to be thought the greatest person who can of himself foresee what isadvantageous. The next in greatness is he who by those things which happen toother men, observes what is good for himself. The worst is he who stays to learnwhat is best by the experience of suffering ill.He said that they who are desirous of glory shall not do amiss if they imitatethose who are crowned for running. For they do no harm to their adversaries, butdesire that they themselves may obtain the victory. And it is suitable tomagistrates not to be rigid to those who contradict them, but to benefit thosewho obey them.He likewise exhorted everyone that aimed at true glory to be indeed such as hedesired to appear to others. For it is not so sacred a thing to be advised byanother as to be praised for what is done; for one is only requisite to men, theother much more used by the gods.In conclusion, he said that their city chanced to be built by Hercules. When hedrove Gerion's oxen through Italy, being injured by Laecinius, Croto came tohelp him. Hercules, not knowing Croto by reason of the night, and thinking himto be one of his enemies, slew him. And then he promised at his grave that hewould build a city which should bear his name, if ever he came to be a god. Ingratitude for the kindness of Hercules, Pythagoras said it behooved them togovern their commonwealth justly.They hearing this built a temple to the Muses, and put away the concubines whichthey used to keep; and entreated him to discourse severally in the temple ofPythian Apollo to the boys, and in the temple of Juno to the women.149[endnote.xhtml#ftn149]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14HIS ORATION TO THE BOYSHe, being persuaded by them, discoursed to the boys in this manner:150[endnote.xhtml#ftn150]That they should neither begin abusive and insulting behavior, nor return suchto the reproachers. And concerning images [images/75_1.png] (proper training andmoral instruction), which is the same name as the time of their youth, hecommanded them diligently to pursue it; adding that to a well-disposed youth itis easy to preserve honesty throughout all his life. To him that is notwell-disposed, it is hard at that time to continue it; but more difficult froman ill beginning to run to the end. Moreover he declared, that boys are mostbeloved of the gods. And for that reason, in times of dearth they are sent forthto pray to the gods for rain, as if the deity would soonest hear them. And theyonly, being always sanctified, had leave to live in the temple.For the same reason, the gods that are most kind to men—Apollo and Cupid—are byall painters represented, as having that age (of boys). It is likewiseacknowledged that the crowned games were instituted for the sake of boys. ThePythian, upon the conquest of Pytho by a boy that in name; for a boy likewise,and that in Isthmus, upon the death of Archemorus and Melicertus.Besides all this, at the building of the city Crotona, Apollo told the leader ofthe colony that he would give him a progeny if he conducted his colony to Italy.Whence they ought to reflect that Apollo has a particular providence for thegeneration—and over youth—even of all the gods. Wherefore they ought to study tobe worthy of their love, and employ themselves in hearing, that they may be ableto speak. Moreover, if they would live to be old themselves, they should obeytheir elders and not contradict them; for by that means they will becomeesteemed worthy, and not to be injured by those that are younger thenthemselves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15HIS ORATION TO THE WOMENIt is said, that he discoursed to the women concerning sacrifices.151[endnote.xhtml#ftn151]First, that as when another man were to pray for them, they would have him to behonest and good, because the gods hearken to such men; in like manner oughtthey, above all things, so to behave themselves as that they may indeed have thegods attentive to their prayers.Next, that they must present the gods with such things as they themselves makewith their own hands. And without the help of servants, offer them at the altar;as cakes, wax and incense. But that they present not the deity with slaughterand death; nor that they offer so much at one time, as if they were never tocome thither again.As concerning their conversation towards their husbands, he commanded them toconsider that fathers did yield to their daughters, that their husbands shouldbe more beloved by them than their parents. Wherefore it is fit that either theycontradict their husbands in nothing, or then think they have the victory whenthey are overruled by them.Moreover he spared that well-known apothegm concerning coition: that for her whorises from her own husband, it is lawful to go to the temples the same day; butfor her who rises from him that is not her husband, never.He exhorted them likewise, throughout their whole lives to speak well of others,and to take care that others speak well of them; and that they destroy not thatgood report which is given. He cautioned them not to confute thosemythographers, who (seeing the justice of women—that they lend their garmentswithout witness when any has need of them, and that they made no bargains andengagements) feigned three women who made use of one eye amongst them because oftheir readiness to communicate. Which if applied to men, as if when one hadreceived anything he should restore presently or communicate to his neighbor,everyone would say there is no such thing, it being contrary to their nature.Further, he who is said to be the wisest of all persons, who disposed thelanguage of men and invented all names—whether he were a god, or a daemon, orsome divine man—upon consideration, because the female sex is most addicted topiety, made every degree of age synonymous with some god. He called theunmarried woman Core; she who is given to man Nympha; she who has childrenMother; she who has children's children, in the Doric dialect, Maija; to whichrespect of their devotion it agrees that the oracles at Dodona and Delphi aredelivered by women.152 [endnote.xhtml#ftn152]Having thus commended their devotion, he converted his discourse to speak ofdecency of habit: that none should presume to wear any sumptuous cloths, butoffer them all at Juno's temple (which amounted to) many millions of garments.He is reported also to have said thus: that throughout the country of theCrotonians, the virtue of a man towards his wife was much celebrated. Ulyssesrefused Immortality at Calypso's hands rather than to forsake Penelope. Let itbe the part of the wives to express their virtuous loyalty towards theirhusbands, that this praise may be reciprocal.153 [endnote.xhtml#ftn153]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16HIS INSTITUTION OF A SECT IN PRIVATE AND PUBLICBy this discourse, Pythagoras gained no small honor and esteem in Crotona, andby means of that city, throughout all Italy.154 [endnote.xhtml#ftn154]At the first oration that he made in Crotona,155 [endnote.xhtml#ftn155] heattracted many followers. Insomuch that it is said he gained 600 persons, whowere by him not only won to the philosophy which he professed, but following hisrules, became as we call it Caenobii; and these were they who studiedphilosophy.156 [endnote.xhtml#ftn156] They did put their estates into one commonstock, and kept silence five years, only hearing his discourses, but not seeinghim until they were fully proved; and then they became of his family and wereadmitted to him. There were the same 600 persons, who Laertius says, came to hisnocturnal discourse, perhaps meaning the lectures through a screen during theirprobation. For he adds that if any of them were thought worthy to see him, theywrote of it to their friends as having obtained a great matter. This societyLaertius calls his “system,” which Cassiodorus interprets as “college,” andAulius Gellius his “family.”Besides these, there were many auditors called Acousmatics,157[endnote.xhtml#ftn157] whereof he gained, as Nicomachus relates,158[endnote.xhtml#ftn158] two thousand by one oration which he made at his firstcoming into Italy. That they need not live at home, they erected a largeHomacoceion,159 [endnote.xhtml#ftn159] which Clement of Alexandria interprets tobe the same as Ecclesia, “Church,” with us. Here were admitted also boys andwomen. They built cities, and inhabited all that part of Italy which is calledMagna Graecia, and received laws and statutes from Pythagoras as divineprecepts, without which they did not anything. They lived together unanimously,praised by all, and applauded as happy for such as lived round about them.Thus Pythagoras distinguished those whom he admitted according to their severalmerits. For it was not fit that all should partake alike, being not of a likenature. Nor was it fit that some should receive all the learning, others none;for that would have been contrary to his community of all and to his equality.He therefore, of the discourses which he made, communicated to everyone thatpart which was proper for him; and distributed his learning so that it mightbenefit everyone according to his capacity. He observed the rules of Justice ingiving to everyone that share of the discourse which they deserved; calling uponthis account, some Pythogoreans (those of the system), and some Pythagorites(those of the Homacoceion), as we call some Attics, some Atticists.Dividing them thus aptly into two names, he appointed one part to be images[images/79_1.png] (“Genuine”), the other he ordered to be Imitators of them. Asto the Pythagoreans he decreed, that all their estates should be in common, andthat they should lead their whole lives together in community; but the others heordered to keep their estates to themselves, yet to meet together. Thus was thissuccession of both parties constituted by Pythagoras. The discipline which wasobserved by the more genuine—the Pythagoreans—we shall remit, together with hisdoctrine to the end of his life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17HIS AUTHORITY IN CIVIL AFFAIRSWhatsoever cities in his travels through Italy and Sicily he found subjected toone another (whereof some had been so of a long time, others of late), heinfused into them a passion for liberty through his disciples—of whom he hadsome in every city—and he restored them to liberty.160 [endnote.xhtml#ftn160]Thus he freed Crotona, Sybaris, Catana, Rhegium, Himera, Agrigentum,Tauromenium, and some others, to whom he sent laws by Charondas the Catanaean,and Zaleucus the Locrian, by means whereof they lasted a long time wellgoverned, and were deservedly envied by their neighbors.He wholly took away dissension, not only from among his disciples and theirsuccessors for many ages after, but also from all the cities of Italy andSicily, both internal and external dissension. For he did frequently pronounceto all manner of persons everywhere, whether many or few, an apothegm whichresembles an admonitory oracle of God, which was a kind of epitome orrecapitulation of all that he taught. The apothegm was this:That we ought to avoid with our utmost endeavor, and to amputate with fire andsword and all other means: from the body, sickness; from the soul, ignorance;from the belly, luxury; from a city, sedition; from a family, discord; from allthings, excess.By which he did indulgently put everyone in mind of his best doctrines.Yet is he reported to have been the occasion of the war between the Sybaritesand the Crotonians, which ended in the total Subversion of the Sybarites. Themanner is thus related by Diodorus Siculus, and Iamblichus.images [images/star.png]When the Grecians built Sybaris in Italy,161 [endnote.xhtml#ftn161] it soon cameto pass that through the goodness of the soil (though Athaeneus deny it to befertile162 [endnote.xhtml#ftn162]), the city became in a short time very rich.For being seated between two rivers, Crathis and Sybaris (from which it took itsname), and the citizens possessing a large country, they soon gathered togethergreat riches; and admitting many to be free of their country, they arrived tosuch height that they seemed far to excel all the rest of the inhabitants ofItaly. Yet, they were so luxurious that they became infamous even to a proverb;and no less addicted to all other vices, insomuch that they, out of insolence,put to death thirty ambassadors of the Crotonians, and threw their bodies fromthe walls to be devoured by beasts.163 [endnote.xhtml#ftn163]The city was so populous, that it contained no less then 300,000 persons. Atthat time Telys was chief magistrate, who, accusing the greatest men, procuredof the Sybarites to banish 500 of the richest citizens, and to confiscate theirgoods. These banished men went to Crotona, and there, after the manner ofsuppliants, fled to the Altars erected in the Forum. Hereupon Telys sentambassadors to the Crotonians to declare, that they should either deliver up thebanished men or expect war. (These Sybarite ambassadors had been instrumental inthe murder of some friends of Pythagoras, perhaps some of the thirty Crotonianswhom they slew.164 [endnote.xhtml#ftn164]) Amongst them, one there was who hadkilled some of the ambassadors with his own hands; another was son to one of thesame murderers who had since died. Moreover, he was of those kinds of persons,who, being oppressed with want, stir up sedition that they may take occasionthereby to fall on the goods of others.These Sybarites came to Pythagoras and blamed him; and one of them (which was hethat had a hand in the death of his friends) demanding a reason of his reproof,he said that he did not give Laws. Whereupon they accused him as if he had madehimself Apollo, and especially for that before, upon a question being asked,“Why these things were so,” he asked him that propounded the question, whether,when Apollo delivered his oracles, he would require him to render a reason? Theother deriding, as he thought, those discourses in which Pythagoras declared thereturn of the soul, and telling him that when he went into the other world, hewould give him a letter to carry to his father, and desired him to bring ananswer of it when he came back. “I shall not,” replied Pythagoras, “go to theplace of the wicked, where murderers are punished.”The ambassadors having thus reviled him, and he going to the seaside, andwashing himself, many followed him. One of those who advised the Crotonianssaid—when he had sufficiently spoken against all the other things that theydid—at last he accused them especially for offering to oppose and abusePythagoras, of whom when heretofore, as fables report, beasts could speak, noone of them durst ever speak an ill word.Diodorus says that a council being called,165 [endnote.xhtml#ftn165] and itbeing put to the question whether they should deliver up the Italiotes to theSybarites, or undergo a war with an enemy more powerful than themselves,166[endnote.xhtml#ftn166] the Senate and people made some doubt. The people firstinclined to the delivery of the suppliants rather than endure the war. Butafterwards, Pythagoras the philosopher advising them to protect the suppliants,they changed their opinion and determined to fight in their defense.The Sybarites came into the field, with an army of 300,000; the Crotonians hadbut 100,000. They were led by Milo, the wrestler, who at the first onset himselfput to flight that wing of the army which was opposite to him; for he was ofinvincible strength. This man having courage answerable to his strength, hadbeen six times victor at the Olympic Games. And when he began this fight, he wascrowned with Olympic wreaths, wearing like Hercules a lion's skin and carrying aclub; and obtaining the victory for his countrymen, was much admired by them.The Crotonians likewise made use of a stratagem, whereby they got the day. TheSybarites were so much addicted to luxury, that they taught their horses todance at feasts.167 [endnote.xhtml#ftn167] This the Crotonians knowing, asAristotle relates, in the midst of the fight they commanded some pipers, whom tothat purpose they had brought along with them, to play dancing tunes. Thehorses, as soon as they heard the music, not only fell a dancing but carriedtheir riders violently over to their enemies. Thus the Sybarites being put toflight, the Crotonians spared none that they took, but put all to the sword,whereby the greater part of the army was slain, and the city, after adishonorable surrender, laid waste. This according to Diodorus, happenedsixty-three years before the second of the eighty-third Olympiad [ca. 443 B.C.],which falls upon the first year of the sixty-eighth Olympiad [ca. 504 B.C.].Agrigentum was also by the counsel of Pythagoras freed from the tyranny ofPhalaris in this manner. Pythagoras was detained by Phalaris,168[endnote.xhtml#ftn168] a most cruel tyrant with whom he stayed six months.169[endnote.xhtml#ftn169] Abaris the Hyperborean, a wise person, came to conversewith him and asked him questions—particularly concerning sacred rites, images,divine worship, providence of the gods, as well of those in heaven, asconversant about the earth, and such like demands. Pythagoras, as being highlyinspired, answered him with much truth and persuasion, insomuch as he drew thestanders by to his opinion. Whereupon Phalaris, seeing the people taken withhim, was angry with Abaris for praising Pythagoras. He grew fierce againstPythagoras himself, and at last came to that height as to speak all blasphemiesagainst the gods as were possible for such a kind of person. But Abarisacknowledged himself thankful to Pythagoras for the things he learned of him:that all things depend upon heaven and are disposed of from thence, which hecollected as from many other things, so especially from the efficacy ofsacrifices. Far therefore was he from thinking that Pythagoras, who taught himthese things, was a deceiver; but he rather admired him, as a personsupernaturally inspired. Phalaris, in answer hereunto, denied plainly and openlyall things that were done in sacred rites.Whereupon Abaris transferred his discourse from these things to such as appearmanifestly to all men, and by the divine operations which are in allextremities—as in extraordinary wars, and in incurable diseases, destruction offruit, transmission of pestilence from country to country. By these difficultirremediable causes, he endeavored to prove that there is a divine providencewhich overrules all human hope and power. But Phalaris impudently opposed it.Hereupon Pythagoras, knowing that this day would be fatal to Phalaris, spokevery freely; and looking upon Abaris, said, that there is a passage from heavento the aerial and terrestrial parts; and did likewise discourse scientifically,concerning the dependence of all things upon Heaven; and did irrefragablydemonstrate the free power of the soul; and proceeded to show the perfectoperation of the reason and of the mind. Then he spoke boldly concerningtyranny, and all excess of fortune, all injustice, all covetousness, stronglymaintaining that they are all worth nothing. After this, he made a divineexhortation concerning the best life, and made a resolute opposition against theworst, and did most plainly deliver the doctrine concerning the power andpassions of the soul. And what was more then all these, he demonstrated that thegods are not the causes of ills; and that diseases and passions are seeds of theintemperance of the body. And he reprehended mythographers and poets for suchthings as they had falsely delivered; and sharply reproved Phalaris, and showedwhat the power of heaven is, and how great, by its operations.As concerning infliction of punishment by law, he gave many instances thereof,and clearly showed the difference between man and other living creatures. Helikewise scientifically discoursed concerning intrinsical and enunciativereason, and concerning the mind, and the knowledge proceeding from it, with manyother moral documents dependent thereon. He treated of what things are useful inlife, making an exhortation to the pursuit of the useful, and condemning thehurtful. And that which is most of all, he made a distinction between the thingsdone according to fate, and according to the mind, and of those which are doneaccording to necessity, and according to decree. Moreover he discoursedconcerning daemons, and the immortality of the soul, much and wisely (whereof weshall have occasion to speak elsewhere). He showed that these things do confermost to fortitude, seeing that he himself in the midst of all dangers, did witha constant mind discourse philosophy and arm himself against Fortune; as alsofor that he slighted and condemned the person that attempted to hurt him, anddespised the fear of death, and all human contingencies; nor was he at thatinstant at all concerned for them.Indeed (continues Iamblichus) it is manifest, that he was nothing troubled withthe fear of death, but had a far more noble design—the freeing of Sicily fromthe oppression of tyranny. That it was he who did it is manifest from the oracleof Apollo, which declared that Phalaris, when his subjects grew better and moreunanimous, should lose his authority; which they did at the coming of Pythagorasthrough his exhortations and Instructions. But a clearer evidence hereof is fromthe time: for that very day that Phalaris went about to bring Pythagoras andAlaris into danger of death, he was himself slain. The manner is thus related byTzeizes.170 [endnote.xhtml#ftn170]It chanced, that a hawk pursued a great flight of pigeons; which Phalarisseeing, said to those that stood by him, “Behold friends, how much an ignoblefear can do; for if but one of all these pigeons would turn again, it wouldpresently give a stop to the pursuer.” This speech an old man that was presentno sooner heard, when taking up a stone he threw it at Phalaris; and the rest,following his example, did the like. Some say they stoned him to death; others,that they put him into chains, and wrapped him in a sheet of lead, wherein hedied miserably.To the Locrians, besides Charondas and Zeleucus already mentioned, he sentTimaratus also to make laws for them.171 [endnote.xhtml#ftn171] To theRheginenses, he sent upon the same employment Theatetus, Helicaon, Aristrocratesand Phytius.172 [endnote.xhtml#ftn172]Thus, as Porphyry says, Pythagoras and his friends were for a long time so muchadmired in Italy, that many cities committed themselves to be governed bythem.173 [endnote.xhtml#ftn173]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18WONDERS RELATED OF HIMIf we may credit (says Porphyry, and from him Iamblichus174[endnote.xhtml#ftn174]) what is related of Pythagoras by ancient and creditableauthors, his commands had an Influence even upon irrational creatures. For helaid hold of the Daunian bear which did much hurt to the people thereabout, andhaving stroked her awhile, and given her mazza and fruits, and sworn her thatshe never more touch any living creature, he let her go. She straightaway hidherself in the hills and woods, and from thenceforward never assaulted anyliving creature.Seeing an ox at Tarentum in a pasture wherein grew several things, munching ongreen beans, he came to the shepherd and counseled him to speak to the Ox thathe should abstain from the beans.175 [endnote.xhtml#ftn175] But the shepherdmocked him, and said he could not speak the language of oxen. Pythagoras himselfwent up to the ox and whispered in his ear. The animal not only refrainedimmediately from Beans at that time, but from thenceforward would never touchany. He lived many years after about Juno's temple at Tarentum till he was veryold; and called the sacred ox, eating such meats as everyone gave him.At the Olympic Games, as Pythagoras was by chance discoursing to his friendsconcerning auguries, omens, and divine signs, and that there are some messagesfrom the gods to such men as have true piety towards them, an eagle flew overhis head. He is said by certain words to have stopped her, and to have causedher to come down.176 [endnote.xhtml#ftn176] After he had stroked her awhile, helet her go again.177 [endnote.xhtml#ftn177] This perhaps was that white eaglethat Iamblichus reports he stroked at Croto, and she endured it quietly. For theCrotonians instituted games, which they called Olympic in emulation of theGrecians.There is also the story of a river (which Porphyry calls Caucasus;178[endnote.xhtml#ftn178] Apollonius, images [images/86_1.png] [“a river nearSamos”]; Laertius and Iamblichus, Nessus; Aelian, Cosa; St. Cyril, Causus). Ashe passed over it with many of his friends, the river spoke to him and said witha plain clear voice, images [images/86_2.png] “Hail Pythagoras.”In one and the same day, almost all affirm, that he was present at Metapontum inItaly, and at Tauromenium in Sicily, with the friends which he had in bothplaces. He discoursed to them in a public convention, when as the places aredistant many stadia by sea and land, and many days journeys asunder.179[endnote.xhtml#ftn179] Apollonius relates this as done at Croto and Metapontum.At the public solemnity of the Olympic Games, he stood up and showed his goldenthigh;180 [endnote.xhtml#ftn180] as he did in private to Abarus, to confirm himin the opinion that he was Hyperborean Apollo, whose priest Abarus was.181[endnote.xhtml#ftn181]A ship coming into the harbor, and his friends wishing they had the goods thatwere in it, Pythagoras told them, “Then you will have a dead body.” And, whenthe ship came at them, they found in it the body of a dead man.182[endnote.xhtml#ftn182]To one who much desired to hear him, he said that he would not discourse untilsome sign appeared.183 [endnote.xhtml#ftn183] Not long after, one coming tobring news of the death of a white bear in Caulonia, he prevented him andrelated it first.They affirm, he foretold many things and that they came to pass.184[endnote.xhtml#ftn184] Insomuch that Aristippus the Kyrenaean, in his book onPhysiology, says he was named “Pythagoras” from speaking things as true asPythian Apollo.185 [endnote.xhtml#ftn185] He foretold an earthquake by the waterwhich he tasted out of a well; and foretold, that a ship, which was then undersail with a pleasant gale, should be cast away.At Sybarus, he took in his hand a serpent of deadly biting and let it go again.And at Tyrrhenia, he took a little serpent and biting it, killed it with histeeth.A thousand other more wonderful and divine things are related constantly, andwith full agreement, about him; so that, to speak freely, more was neverattributed to any, nor was any more eminent. For his predictions of earthquakesmost certainly are remembered, and his immediate chasing away of the pestilence.And his suppression of violent winds and hail, and his calming of storms—as wellin rivers as upon the sea for the ease and safe passage of his friends—from whomEmpedocles, Epimenides, and Abaris learning it, often performed the like, whichtheir poems plainly attest. Besides, Empedocles was surnamed Alexanemos, theChaser away of Winds; Epimenides, Cathartes, the Lustrator; Abaris, Aethrobates,the walker in the air (for, riding upon an arrow of Hyperborean Apollo which wasgiven him, he was carried in the air over rivers and seas and inaccessibleplaces, which some believed to have been done by Pythagoras when he discoursedwith his friends at Metapontum and Tauromenium upon the same day).To these add his trick with a looking glass, as the scholiast of Aristophanescalls it, who describes it thus. The Moon being in the full, he wrote whatsoeverhe pleased in blood upon a looking glass. And telling it first to the otherparty, stood behind him, holding the letters towards the Moon; whereby he whostood between him and the Moon, looking steadfastly upon her, read all theletters which were written in the looking glass in the Moon, as if they werewritten in her.186 [endnote.xhtml#ftn186]But these things, some even of the ancients have imputed to Goetic Magic, asTimon, who terms Pythagoras, images [images/88_1.png] a Magician.† Others imputethese to imposture, as appears by this relation of Hermippus and the scholiastof Apollonius. They say that when he came into Italy he made a vaultunderground, and charged his mother to give out that he was dead, and to setdown in a table-book all things that happened, expressing the times punctually.Then he went down and shut himself up in the vault, and his mother did as heordered her, until such time as he came up again. After a while, Pythagoras cameup lean and withered. Approaching the congregation, he declared that he wasreturned from the Infernal Regions,187 [endnote.xhtml#ftn187] and related tothem what was done there, and told them many prodigious stories concerning theReborn, and the things of the Infernal Regions; telling the living news of theirdead friends with whom he said he met in the Infernal Regions.188[endnote.xhtml#ftn188] Hieronymus relates that he saw there the soul of Hesiodbound with brass to a pillar, screeching; and that of Homer hung up on a tree,encompassed by serpents, for the fables which he had raised concerning the gods.Those likewise were tormented who used not the company of their own wives.189[endnote.xhtml#ftn189]For this he was much honored by the Crotonians. They being much moved at what hesaid, wept and lamented, and hereupon conceived such an esteem of Pythagoras asbeing a divine person, that they sent their wives to him to be instructed in hisdoctrine, which women were called “Pythagoreans.” Thus says Hermippus. Thescholiast adds that hereby he raised an opinion concerning himself: that beforethe Trojan War he was Aethalides, the son of Mercury; then Euphorbus; thenHermotimus; then Pyrrhus, a Delian; lastly, Pythogoras.190[endnote.xhtml#ftn190] And, as Laertius says in his writings, he reported ofhimself that he had come from the Infernal Regions to men 207 years since. Ofthis, more in the Pythagoran Doctrine, see Part 3, The Transmigration of theSoul [page 256]."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19HIS DEATHThe time of the death of Pythagoras has been formerly touched. It was, accordingto Eusebius, in the fourth year of the seventieth Olympiad [ca. 493 B.C.], afterhe had lived, as Justin says, at Crotona for twenty years.191[endnote.xhtml#ftn191]The occasion is differently related by Laertius, who says Pythagoras died inthis manner: As he sat in counsel together with his friends, in the house ofMilo, it happened that the house was set on fire by one who did it out of envy,because he was not admitted. Some affirm the Crotonians did it out of fear ofbeing reduced to a tyranny. Pythagoras, running away, was overtaken when, comingto a field full of beans, he made a stop saying, “It is better to be taken thanto tread, and better to be killed than to speak.” So the pursuers slew him. Inthe same manner died most of his disciples, about forty in number. Some few onlyescaped, of whom were Archytas the Tarentine, and Lysis, of whom we spakebefore.Dicaearchus says that Pythagoras fled to the Temple of the Muses at Metapontum,and died for want of food, having lived there forty days without eating.Heraclides, in his Epitome of the Lives of Satyrus, relates that having buriedPherecydes, he returned to Italy where, finding the faction of Cyclo prevalent,he departed to Metapontum and there starved himself, not willing to live anylonger. Hermippus says that the Agrigentines and Syracusians warring against oneanother, Pythagoras with his friends went to the Agrigentines and was head ofthem. But they being vanquished, and he flying to a field of beans, was thereslain; the rest (being thirty five) were burned at Tarentum for intermeddlingwith the governors and rule of the commonwealth.Iamblichus, from Aristoxenus and others, gives a more particular account. Therewere, says he, some who opposed these men and rose up against them. That thisconspiracy happened in the absence of Pythagoras is acknowledged by all; butthey disagree concerning his journey. Some say he was gone to Pherecydes, theSyrian; others to Metapontum. The causes of this conspiracy are diverselyrelated also. One is said to have proceeded from the men who were calledCylonians. Cylo, a Crotonian—who in race, honor, and wealth excelled all therest of the citizens, but was otherwise of a harsh, violent, turbulent, andtyrannical humor—was exceedingly desirous to participate in the Pythagoreaninstitution. Coming to Pythagoras, who was now very old, he was repulsed for thereasons aforesaid. Hereupon there arose a great contest, Cylo and his friendsopposing Pythagoras and his friends. And so eager and violent was the malice ofCylo and his party, that it extended even to the last of the Pythagoreans.Pythagoras therefore for this reason departed to Metapontum where it is saidthat he died.The Cylonians (so called) continued to exercise their hatred and enmity towardsthe Pythagoreans, and the kindness of the cities (which was so great as to begoverned by them) was prevalent. But at last, they so plotted against thePythagoreans, that surprising them assembled in the house of Milo at Crotonaconsulting about military affairs, they burned them all except two, Archippusand Lysis, who being youthful and strong escaped out of doors.This falling out, and the cities not taking any notice of the misfortune, thePythagoreans gave up their business. This happened from two causes: as well byreason of the unconcernment of the cities (for they had no regard of the murder,to punish the authors hereof), as by reason of the death of the most excellentpersons—two only of them were saved, both Tarentum. But Lysis, out of hatred ofthe neglect they had received from the cities, departed into Greece and lived atAchaea in Peloponnesus. Thence, upon a particular design, he removed to Thebes,where Epimanondas heard him, and called him Father, and there he died.The rest of the Pythagoreans, all but Arthitas the Tarentine, forsook Italy andassembling at Rhegium, they lived there together. But in progress of time, themanagement of public affairs decayed. The most eminent of these were Phanto, andEchecrates, and Polymnastus, and Diocles (both Phliasians), and Xenophilus, aChalcidean of Chalcis in Thrace. These preserved the customs and doctrines fromthe beginning, but with the sect itself, at last they were wholly extinguished.This is related by Aristoxenus.Nicomachus agrees in all things with this relation. Except in that he says thisInsurrection happened at the time Pythagoras was gone to Delos to visitPherecydes, who was sick of a Phthiriasis. Then were they stoned and burned bythe Italiotes and cast forth without burial. Hitherto Iamblichus.With these also agrees the relation of Neanthes, thus delivered by Porphyry.192[endnote.xhtml#ftn192]Pythagoras and his friends, having been a long time so much admired in Italy,many cities committed themselves to them. At last they became envied, and aconspiracy was made against them in this manner. Cylo was a Crotonian, who inextract, nobility, and wealth exceeded all the rest of the citizens, butotherwise was of a violent, rigid, and tyrannical disposition, and one that madeuse of the multitude of his friends to compass his unjust ends. As he esteemedhimself worthy of all excellent things, so most particularly to partake of thePythagorean philosophy, he came to Pythagoras and much extolled himself anddesired his conversation. But Pythagoras presently observing the nature andmanners of the person, and perceiving by the signs which he observed in thebodies of such as came to him what kind of disposition he was of, bade himdepart and go about his business. Hereat Cylo was not a little troubled, takingit for a great affront, being of himself a person of a rough violent spirit.Therefore, calling his friends together, he began to accuse Pythagoras and toconspire against him and his disciples. Whereupon, as some relate, the friendsof Pythagoras were gathered together in the house of Milo the wrestler.Pythagoras himself was absent for he was gone to Delos to visit Pherecydes, theSyrian, formerly his master, who was desperately fallen sick of a Phthiriasis,and to attend on him. Cyclo's men set the house on fire, and burned and stonedthem all, except two who escaped the fire, Archippus and Lysis, as Neanthesrelates, of whom Lysis went into Greece to Epimanondas, whose master he hadformerly been.But Dicaerchus and other more accurate authors affirm that Pythagoras himselfwas there present when this conspiracy was perpetrated; for Pherecydes diedbefore he left Samos.193 [endnote.xhtml#ftn193] Of his friends, forty beinggathered together were beset in a house; most of them going dispersedly to thecity were slain. Pythagoras, his friends being taken, first escaped to theCaulonian haven, thence went to the Locrians. The Locrians sent some old men tothe borders of their country who gave him this answer, “We have heard,Pythagoras, that thou art a person wise and of great worth; but we have nothingin our laws that is reprehensible, and therefore we will endeavor to preservethem. Go to some other place, taking of us whatsoever you have need of.”Hereupon leaving the city of the Locrians, he sailed to Tarentum, wherereceiving the same entertainment he had at Crotona, he went to Metapontum. Forgreat seditions were raised against him in every part which are remembered bythe inhabitants to this day. They recount the seditions against thePythagoreans, as they call them, for all that faction which sided withPythagoras were called Pythagoreans. In the Metapontine faction, Pythagoras issaid to have died, flying to the Temple of the Muses and staying there fortydays, through want of necessaries.194 [endnote.xhtml#ftn194]Others relate that when the house wherein his Friends used to meet was fired,his friends threw themselves into the fire to make a way for their master,spreading their bodies like a bridge upon the first; and that Pythagoras,escaping out of the burning, destitute of all his friends, for grief ended hisdays.With these men, oppressed with this calamity, failed their knowledge also—whichtill then they had preserved secret and concealed, except some things difficultto be understood, which the auditors that lived without the screen, repeated byheart. Lysis and Archippus escaping, and as many as were at that time in otherparts, preserved some little sparks of philosophy, obscure and difficult to befound out. For being not left alone, and much grieved at the perpetration ofthat wickedness, fearing lest the name of Philosophy should be quiteextinguished amongst men, and that for this reason the gods would be angry withthem, they made some summary commentaries. And having rendered the writings ofthe ancients, and those which they remembered into one body, everyone left themin the place where they died, charging their sons, daughters, and wives thatthey should not communicate them to any outside their own family. Thus privatelycontinuing it successively to their successors, they observed it a long time.And for this reason, says Nicomachus, we conjecture that they did purposelyavoid friendship with strangers; and for many ages they preserved a faithfulconstant friendship amongst themselves.Moderatus says that this Pythagorean philosophy came at last to be extinguished.First, because it was enigmatic. Next, because their writings were in the Doricdialect which is obscure; and by which means the doctrines delivered in it werenot understood, being spurious and misapprehended. Because moreover, they whopublished them were not Pythagoreans.195 [endnote.xhtml#ftn195] Besides, Plato,Aristotle, Speusippus, Aristoxenus, and Xenocrates, as the Pythagoreans affirm,vented the best of them as their own, changing only some few things in them. Butthe more vulgar and trivial, and whatsoever was afterwards invented by enviousand calumnious persons to cast a contempt upon the Pythagorean school, theycollected and delivered as proper to that sect.But forasmuch as Apollonius gives a different account of these things, and addsmany things which have not yet been spoken, let us give his narration alsoconcerning the insurrection against the Pythagoreans.196 [endnote.xhtml#ftn196]He says that the Pythagoreans were envied from their very childhood; for thepeople, as long as Pythagoras discoursed with all that came to him, loved himexceedingly; but when he applied himself only to his disciples, they undervaluedhim. That he should admit strangers, they well enough suffered; but that thenatives of the country should attribute so much to him, they took very ill, andsuspected their meetings to be contrivements against them. Besides, the youngmen being of the best rank and estate, it came to pass that after a while theywere not only the chief persons in their own families, but governed even thewhole city. They becoming many as a society (for they were above 300 persons),but being a small part as to the city, which was not ordered according to theirmanners and institutions. Notwithstanding, as long as they possessed the placethey were in only, and Pythagoras lived there, the city followed the originalgovernment thereof, though much perplexed, and watching for an opportunity forchange.But after they had reduced Sybaris, and that he departed, and they distributedthe conquered country into colonies as they pleased; at length, the concealedhatred broke forth, and the multitude began to quarrel with them. The leaders ofthis dissension were those who had been nearest allied to the Pythagoreans. Manythings had in the past grieved them, according as they were particularlyaffected. But one of the greatest was that Pythagoras only should be thoughtincapable of disrespect. For the Pythagoreans used never to name Pythagoras; butwhile he lived, they called him “Divine”; after death, “the Man,” as Homerintroduces Eumaeus mentioning Ulysses:I to pronounce his name, though absent, fear;So great is my respect, and he so dear.In like manner, dissenters were disturbed by the disciplines of the Pythagoreancommunity. Not to rise out of bed after the Sun is up, nor to wear a ringwhereon the image of God is engraved; but to observe the Sun that they may adorehis rising, and not to wear a ring lest they might chance to have it on at afuneral or carry it into any unclean place. Likewise, not to do anything withoutpremeditation, nor anything whereof they could not give a good account; but thatin the morning they should consider what they were to do, and at night theyshould make a recollection thereof, as well to ponder the things themselves asto exercise the memory. Likewise, if anyone of that community had appointed tomeet another in any place, he should stay there day and night until the othercame. The Pythagoreans likewise accustomed themselves to be mindful of what issaid, and to speak nothing rashly. But above all things, as an inviolableprecept to be kept even until death, he advised them not to reproach, but alwaysto use good words as at sacrifices.These things much displeased all in general, as I said, forasmuch as theyadmitted men to be educated in this singularity amongst them. But in that thePythagoreans reached forth the hands to fellow members only, and not to any oftheir own family except their parents; likewise, in that they had their estatesin common, wholly alienated from their own domestics; hereat their allies weremuch displeased. And they, beginning the dissension, the rest readily joinedthemselves and engaged in it.And at the same time, Hippasus, Diodorus, and Theages said that it was fiteveryone should partake of the public government and convention; and that themagistrates, being chosen by lot, ought to give account. But on the other side,the Pythagoreans Alcimachus, Dimachus, Meto, and Democedes opposed it, andforbid that the government of the country should be abrogated. These taking thepart of the commons, got the better. But afterwards, many of the common peopleunderstood that there was a division in the public convention. The orators Cyloand Nino framed an accusation against the Pythagoreans: the first was one of thebest quality; the other of the vulgar sort. To this effect, a long discoursebeing made by Cylo, the other continued it, pretending that he had found out thegreatest secrets of the Pythagoreans. But indeed having forged and wrote suchthings as thereby he might chiefly traduce them; and having delivered the bookto a notary, had him read it. The title was The Sacred Discourse. The sumwhereof was this: That friends ought to be reverenced as the gods themselves,but all other men tyrannized over like beasts. That the same sentence ofPythagoras himself reduced to verse, was thus rehearsed by his disciples:Friends equal with the gods he did respect,All others (as of no account) neglect.And that Pythagoras chiefly praised Homer for saving images [images/96_1.png]images [images/96_2.png] (“the shepherd of the people”†), he tacitly impliedthat the rest of mankind were but beasts. That he affected oligarchy, and was anenemy to unmarried persons, as those who had been chief in election ofmagistrates by lot. That he affected tyranny, inasmuch as he says, “It is betterto be a bull though but one day, than an ox all our lifetime.” That he praisedthe laws and customs of other people, and commanded that whatsoever was decreedby them should be used.In fine, Nino declared that their philosophy was a conspiracy against thepeople, and advised them that they should not hearken to the voice of theirconsultations—but rather think of forbidding them to meet in counsel at all, ifthey alleged that they had a settled assembly consisting of a thousand voices.Wherefore it was not fit that they should, as far as in them lay, give ear toprohibited persons and permit them to speak; but to esteem their right hand,which they held from them hostile, when they should offer to put in a stone forvoting. He conceived it an unworthy thing that 300,000 men who all lived aboutthe river Tetrais, should be oppressed by seditions and overcome by the thousandpart of them in that city. This calumny so much exasperated the hearers, thatsome few days after, as the Pythagoreans were sacrificing in the Temple ofPythian Apollo, the people ran in tumultuously to do violence to them. But thePythagoreans, being informed beforehand thereof, fled to the public hall.Democedes, with the young men, went to Platea. But they, dissolving the laws,used decrees—whereby accusing Democedes of stirring up the young men to tyranny,they proclaimed, that whosoever did kill him should have in recompence threetalents. And there being a fight, wherein he by the means of Theages wasovercome, they gave him three talents out of the public treasury. But therearising many misfortunes in the city and country, the banished persons werecalled to judgment, and the examination thereof was committed to three cities(Tarentum, Metapontum, and Caulonia). Those who were put in commission thoughtgood, as appears by the Crotonian records, to banish them. So they banished thewhole generation, saying that the children ought not to be separated from theirparents, and seized their estates.But after many years, Dimachus and his friends being slain in another fight, andLitago also who was head of this faction, they took compassion on them, andresolved to call home those who were left. Wherefore sending for theirambassadors from Achaea, they made an agreement with the banished men, and hungup the copies of their oaths in the Temple of Delphi. The Pythagoreans whoreturned, were about threescore, besides those who were very aged, of whom someaddicted themselves to medicine and cured the sick, and so became masters ofthat which is called “method.” Those who were restored grew into great favorwith the people at that time, in which it was proverbially said in opposition tothose who violate the laws, “These are not under the government of Nino.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20HIS PERSON AND VIRTUESHis person, Iamblichus describes, to have been in his youth extraordinarybeautiful.197 [endnote.xhtml#ftn197] He was, as mentioned, called “The fairhaired Samian.”198 [endnote.xhtml#ftn198] And at fifty-six years of age, of amore comely and divine presence. Laertius says he is reported to have been of amost awful aspect, insomuch as his disciples thought him Hyperborean Apollo.199[endnote.xhtml#ftn199] He adds that Timon takes notice of the awfulness of hispresence in his Silli, though he alleged it in disparagement of him.200[endnote.xhtml#ftn200]Pythagoras skilled in the Goetic Laws,Who courts by grave discourse human applause.So great an impression he made upon those with whom he conversed, that a youngman being sharply reprehended by him, immediately went and hanged himself.Whereupon Pythagoras ever after forbore to reprove any person.Lycon, in the Life of Pythagoras, says that he used a spare diet.201[endnote.xhtml#ftn201] Athenaeus says that he drank very little, and lived somoderately that he was often content only with honey.202 [endnote.xhtml#ftn202]By his moderate diet he preserved his body in the same constant state, notsometimes sick, sometimes well, sometimes fat, sometimes lean. It appeared byhis countenance that the same constancy was in his soul also. He was not subjectto joy (as Cicero likewise observes) or grief, no man ever saw him rejoice ormourn. Neither did any ever see him alvum exonerantem, coeuntem [purging hisstomach, having sexual intercourse], or drunk. He refrained wholly fromderision, obsequiousness or servilility, scoffs, and detractive speeches. Henever punished any in anger, neither servant nor free person.203[endnote.xhtml#ftn203]He wore a white and clean stole (or gown), and used white woolen blankets (foras yet linen was not known in those parts),204 [endnote.xhtml#ftn204] and a goldcrown and breeches.205 [endnote.xhtml#ftn205]Diogenes, discoursing of his daily conversation, says he had morning exercisesat his own house, composing his soul to the lyre, and singing some old paeans ofThales.206 [endnote.xhtml#ftn206] He likewise sung some verses of Homer andHesiod, whereby he rendered his mind more sedate. Moreover, he used some dances,which he conceived to conduce to agility and bodily health. His walks he usednot with many promiscuously, but with two or three in the temples or groves,making choice of such places as were most pleasant and remote from noise.Having purchased the estate of Alcaeus, who after his embassy to Lacedaemondied, he was no less admired for his economy than philosophy.207[endnote.xhtml#ftn207]Besides this Pythagoras the philosopher, there were many others of the samename, the most ancient a Laconian, contemporary with King Numa.208[endnote.xhtml#ftn208]Laertius reckons four, all about the same time, or at least not long distantfrom one another. For (besides the philosopher) there was one a Crotonian, atyrannical person. Another was a Phliasian images [images/99_1.png] [“One thatpractices bodily exercises”], images [images/99_2.png] (“Exercitator”† as Plinyrenders it209 [endnote.xhtml#ftn209]), one who professed to teach corporealexercises, and to diet and order the body with them. This seems to be the samePythagoras, son of Eratocles, who wrote Aleiptic Commentaries, and advised thewrestlers instead of figs to eat flesh, both of which are ascribed by some toPythagoras the philosopher.210 [endnote.xhtml#ftn210] The third, a Lacynthian,to whom are ascribed the doctrines of philosophy which it was lawful to divulge,and the proverbial images [images/99_3.png] [“He said it himself”]†; both ofwhich were proper to Pythagoras the philosopher. Some reckon another Pythagorasof Rhegium, a statuary, who invented rhythm and symmetry; and another of Samos,a statuary also (perhaps the same whom Pliny places in the sixty-seventhOlympiad [ca. 508-505 B.C.]211 [endnote.xhtml#ftn211]); and another an orator ofno reputation; another a physician who wrote of images [images/99_4.png] the seaonion† (ascribed by Pliny to the philosopher212 [endnote.xhtml#ftn212]) andconcerning Homer; and another who wrote of the history of the Doreans, asDioysius relates. Hitherto Laertius. To these add Pythagoras the Ephesian,213[endnote.xhtml#ftn213] who lived before Cyrus; another of the same name,Praefect under Ptolemy;214 [endnote.xhtml#ftn214] a third, a painter.215[endnote.xhtml#ftn215]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21HIS WIFE, CHILDREN, AND SERVANTSHe took to wife Theano. Some affirm, she was a Crotonian;216[endnote.xhtml#ftn216] but Porphyry, a Cretan, daughter of Pythanax, orPythonax.217 [endnote.xhtml#ftn217] After the death of Pythagoras, she took uponher the tuition of their children and the government of the school,218[endnote.xhtml#ftn218] marrying Aristaeus, who succeeded him in that dignity.219[endnote.xhtml#ftn219] Laertius says there were some writings extant under hername; whereof Suidas instances philosophical commentaries, apothegms, and a poemin hexameter verse. Of her apothegms are remembered these:Being demanded how soon after coition a woman is pure, she answered, “If withher own Husband, at the same instant; if with a strange person, never.” Sheadvised every woman, when she goes to bed to her husband to put off her modestywith her clothes, and when she rises to put it on again with them. Beingasked—upon occasion perhaps of some ambiguous word, images [images/100_1.png][“what?”]†—which of the two she meant, she answered, “That for which I am calleda woman.”220 [endnote.xhtml#ftn220] To one, admiring her beauty and saying, “Howwhite an arm!” she answered, “But not common.”221 [endnote.xhtml#ftn221]Laertius, who affirms she was daughter to Brontinus, a Crotonian, adds thataccording to some, Theano was wife to Brontinus and disciple to Pythagoras. Andwith this second, it seems the former was frequently confounded. This is soparticularly in the first of the precedent apothegms, which Iamblichus affirmsto have been spoken by Theano, the wife of Brontinus; though attributed by some(of whom Laertius is one) to Theano the wife of Pythagoras.Of the sons of Pythagoras by Theano are remembered Telauges and Mnesarchus.222[endnote.xhtml#ftn222] Mnesarchus seems to be the same whom Plutarch callsMamercus; 223 [endnote.xhtml#ftn223] for both these names are given to thefather of Pythagoras, from whom that of his son doubtless was derived. (By some,he seems to be called Damo, if there be no mistake occasioned by Pythagorashaving a daughter of the same name.224 [endnote.xhtml#ftn224]) These two,Telauges and Mnesarchus, were, upon their father's death, bred up under theirmother Theano. Afterwards they governed the school, as Iamblichus attests ofMnesarchus, Laertius of Telauges, who adds that he taught Empedocles as someconceive. Hippobotus cites out of Empedocles himself, this:Noble Telauges225 [endnote.xhtml#ftn225] from Theano sprung.And great Pythagoras—But of Telauges there is no writing extant. Thus says Laertius, who yetelsewhere cites an epistle of Telauges to Philolaus. And Iamblichus affirms thatsome ascribed to Telauges the sacred discourse, which went under the name ofPythagoras.To these two sons, add (upon the authority of Duris the Samian, in his secondBook of Hours 226 [endnote.xhtml#ftn226]) Arimnestus, master to Democritus.Returning from banishment, he suspended a brazen tablet in the Temple of Juno,the diameter whereof was nigh two cubits, bearing this inscription.Me Arimnestus, who learning traced,Pythagoras beloved son here placed.His daughters were Sara, Maya, Arignota (whose Pythagorean writings Porphyrymentioned as extant in his time), and Damo. With her, Pythagoras left hiswritings at his death, charging her not to communicate them to any that were notwithin the family. Whereupon she, though she might have had much money from thebooks, would not accept it, preferring poverty with obedience to her father'scommand before riches.227 [endnote.xhtml#ftn227] One of his daughters Pythagorasgave in marriage to Meno of Crotona, whom he had educated so well that, when avirgin, she went foremost in the company of the virgins; and when a wife,foremost among the married women. The Crotonians made of her house a temple toCeres. The street on which she lived, they called Museum.Of his servants are particularly remembered two, Astraeus and Zamolxis. Of thefirst, thus says Diogenes in his treatise of Incredible Things Beyond Thule:228[endnote.xhtml#ftn228] Mnesarchus, the father of Pythagoras, being a Tyrrhenianby extract of those Tyrrhenians who inhabited Lemnus, Imber, and Scyrus, wentfrom thence and traveled to many countries and cities. He found an infant lyingunder a large tall poplar, and coming to it, he perceived that it lay with hisface towards the sky, looking steadfastly upon the Sun without winking. In itsmouth was put a little slender reed like a pipe. And seeing to his great wonderthat the child was nourished with the drops that distilled from the tree, hetook the child away, believing it to be of a divine race.This child when he grew up was entertained by Androcles, a native of thatcountry, who adopted him into his own family and committed the management of hisaffairs to his trust. Mnesarchus afterwards growing very rich, brought up thechild, naming him Astraeus, together with his own three sons, Eunostus,Tyrrhenus, and Pythagoras. Androcles put Astraeus under the tutelage ofLutenilt, a wrestler and a painter; but as soon as he was grown up, he sent himto Miletus to Anaximander, to learn geometry and astronomy. Mnesarchus gaveAstraeus to Pythagoras—who receiving him, and considering his physiognomy, andexamining the motions and restings of his body, instructed him. For he firstfound out the way of discerning the nature of every man; neither did heentertain any as his friend or disciple, before he had examined by physiognomyhis disposition.He had likewise another servant whom he entertained in Thrace named Zamolxis—forthat as soon as he was born, they wrapped him in a bear's skin which theThracians call Zalmus. Pythagoras felt friendship toward him and instructed himin sublime speculations, and concerning sacred rites, and the worship of thegods. Some affirm he was called Thales. The Barbarians worshipped him instead ofHercules. Dionysiphanes says he was servant to Pythagoras, and falling into thehands of thieves, and being branded by them, when Pythagoras was disturbed byseditious factions and banished, he bound his forehead about because of thescars. Some say, that the name Zamolxis signifies a strange person. HithertoDiogenes. To this Zamolxis (says Laertius) the Getes sacrifice, as Herodotusrelates, conceiving him to be Saturn. But Herodotus, having delivered thetradition of the Grecians (that he served Pythagoras at Samos, bought out hisfreedom at a great rate, and returning to his country, reformed their manners),concludes with his own opinion that Zamolxis lived many years beforePythagoras.229 [endnote.xhtml#ftn229]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22HIS WRITINGSSome there are who hold, that Pythagoras left not anything in writing. Of thisopinion are Plutarch,230 [endnote.xhtml#ftn230] Josephus,231[endnote.xhtml#ftn231] Lucian,232 [endnote.xhtml#ftn232] Porphyry,233[endnote.xhtml#ftn233] Ruffinus,234 [endnote.xhtml#ftn234] and others. ButLaertius says that all such as affirm he wrote nothing do but jest. ForHeraclitus, the natural philosopher, said expressly that Pythagoras, son ofMnesarchus, was skilful in history above all men; and selecting those writings,made up his own wisdom and variety of learning and art.235[endnote.xhtml#ftn235] To which citation, perhaps, Clement of Alexandria referswho says, Heraclitus being later than Pythagoras, mentioned him in hiswritings.236 [endnote.xhtml#ftn236]The books attributed to Pythagoras are these:Three treatises: Education, Politics, and Physic, to which Laertius237[endnote.xhtml#ftn237] refers the foresaid testimony of Heraclitus—forasmuch asPythagoras, in the beginning of his physical treatise says, “Neither by the airthat I breathe; nor by the water that I drink, shall I not bear the blame ofthis discourse.”238 [endnote.xhtml#ftn238]Six treatises are reckoned by Heraclides, son of Serapion, in his Epitome ofSolion. One concerns the universe in verse. The second entitled, The SacredDiscourse, beginning thus: 239 [endnote.xhtml#ftn239]Young men in silence entertain all these.To the same book perhaps belongs this:Wretched, thrice wretched, beans forebear to eat,Your parents' heads as well may be your meat.And this cited by Eustathius:240 [endnote.xhtml#ftn240]Which way to Orcus souls descend; which wayReturn, and the Sun's cheerful light survey.The third book, of the soul. The fourth, of piety. The fifth concerningHelothales, father of Epicharmus. The sixth, Crotona and others.Two treatises, a discourse concerning nature, and another concerning the gods;both of which he, in a short time, taught Abaris through Hyperborean.241[endnote.xhtml#ftn241] The first may possibly be the same as the physicaltreatise mentioned by Laertius. The second, as Iamblichus says, is entitled alsoThe Sacred Discourse (but it is not the same as that Sacred Discourse whichHeraclides ascribes to him; for that was in verse, this in prose). It isdescribed as being collected out of the most mystical places of Orpheus. Mosthold that it was written by Pythagoras. However, some eminent and creditablepersons of that school assert that Telauges collected commentaries left byPythagoras with Damo, his daughter, sister of Telauges. After her death, theyreport these to have been given to Bitale, daughter of Damo, and to Telauges,son of Pythagoras, husband to Bitale. [This is unclear as written—Ed.] WhatIamblichus cites out of this work (see hereafter in the Doctrine of Pythagoras)is cited also by Hierocles,242 [endnote.xhtml#ftn242] Syrianus, and others.An Oration to Abaris is mentioned by Proclus. Orpheus, a poem, is affirmed byIon the Chian in Triagmis (Laertius).243 [endnote.xhtml#ftn243] The Scopiads,beginning thus, images [images/104_1.png] [“behave not shamelessly to anyone”](Laertius). Hymns, out of which Proclus brings these verses:—Sacred Number SpringsFrom th' uncorrupted Monad, and proceedsTo the Divine Tetractys, she who breedsAll; and assigns the proper bounds to all,Whom we the pure immortal Decad call.Arthmetic is mentioned by Isidore, who affirms Pythagoras was the first thatwrote upon this subject amongst the Grecians, which was afterward more copiouslycomposed by Nicomachus.244 [endnote.xhtml#ftn244]Prognostics, of which thus Tzetzes:245 [endnote.xhtml#ftn245]Pythagoras Samian, Mnesarchus son,Not only knew what would by fate be done,But even for those who futures would perceive,He of Prognostics several Books did leave.Of the Magical Virtues of Herbs, frequently cited by Pliny, who says that thoughsome ascribe it to Cleemporus, a physician, yet pertinacious fame and antiquityvindicate it to Pythagoras. And this very thing gives authority to the volumes.(Pliny asked if anyone thought Cleemporus could have written it, seeing that heput forth other things in his own name.246 [endnote.xhtml#ftn246]) To this workseems to belong that volume, which Pythagoras wrote concerning the sea onion,cited also by Pliny; but by Laertius ascribed to another Pythagoras, aphysician.The Golden Verses of Pythagoras, or as others, of the Pythagoreans. But indeedtheir author, as Suidas says, is not certainly known, though some ascribe themto him. Of these is Proclus who styles him, “Father of the Golden Verses.”247[endnote.xhtml#ftn247] Even the verses themselves seem to confirm it, therebeing amongst them some which Pythagoras is known to have repeated to hisdisciples by the testimonies of Laertius, Porphyry, and others.Nor suffer sleep at night to close thy eyes,Till thrice they acts that day thou hast ore-run;How slipped? What deeds? What duty left undone?Others, such as Chrysippus, attribute them to his disciples;248[endnote.xhtml#ftn248] some particularly to Lysis the Terentine; some toPhilolaus. St. Hierom [i.e., Jerome—Ed.] conceives that the sentences anddoctrines were of Pythagoras, but reduced to verse succinctly by Archippus andLysides, his disciples, who had their schools in Greece and at Thebes, andhaving the precepts of their master by heart, made use of their own ingenuityinstead of books. Or they might be compiled by Epicarmus, of whom Iamblichussays, coming to Syracusa in the reign of Hiero, he forbore to profess philosophyopenly, but did reduce the opinions of the Pythagoreans into verse, thereby insportive manner venting the doctrine of Pythagoras.249 [endnote.xhtml#ftn249]Epistles; of which are extant two only, one to Anaximenes, the other to Hiero.Pythagoras to Anaximenes.And thou, O best of men, if thou didst not excel Pythagoras in extract andhonor, wouldst have left Miletus. But now the honor of this country detainsthee, and would also detain me, were I like Anaximenes. But if you, who are themost considerable persons, should forsake the cities, their glory would be lostand they become more infested by the Medes. Neither is it fit to be alwaysbusied in astrology; but better to take care of our country. Even I myselfbestow not all my time in study, but sometimes in the wars, wherein the Italiansare engaged one against another.This epistle seems to have been written in answer to that of Anaximenes toPythagoras, already produced in the Life of Anaximenes.Pythagoras to Hiero.My life is secure and quiet, but yours will no way suit with me. A moderate andself-denying person, needs not a Sicilian table. Pythagoras, wheresoever hecomes, has all things sufficient for the day; but to serve a Lord is heavy andinsolvable, for one unaccustomed to it. images [images/106_1.png]self-sufficiency, is a great and safe thing. For it has none that envies orconspires against it; whence that life seems to come nearest God. A good habitis not acquired by venereal pleasures nor high feeding, but by indigence, whichleads to Virtue. Various and intemperate pleasures enslave the souls of weakpersons, but especially those which you enjoy, inasmuch as you have givenyourself over to them. For you are carried in suspense, and cannot be safe;because your reason opposes not itself to those things which are pernicious.Therefore, write not Pythagoras to live with you; for physicians will not fallsick to bear their patient's company.These are mentioned as the genuine writings of Pythagoras; others there wereaccounted spurious, such as the following:The Mystic Discourse, which (says Laertius) they affirm to have been written byHippasus, in detraction from Pythagoras. Many writings of Asto, a Crotonian,were likewise ascribed to Pythagoras;250 [endnote.xhtml#ftn250] as were alsoAliptic Commentaries, written indeed by another of that name, son ofEratacles.251 [endnote.xhtml#ftn251]The dialect used by Pythagoras and his disciples was the Doric, which some, suchas Metrodorus cited by Iamblichus, conceive chosen by them as the mostexcellent. Epicharmus, says he, and before him Pythagoras, regarded the Doric asthe best of dialects as it is also the best musical harmony. For the Ionic andAeolic partake of the Chromatic; the Attic is much more participant of theChromatic; but the Doric dialect is Enharmonic, consisting of full soundingletters.The antiquity of the Doric dialect is testified by fable. Deucalion (son ofPrometheus) and Pyrrha (daughter of Epimetheus) begot Hellen, father of thewhole Hellenic race. (In the Babylonian sacred records, Hellen is said to be theson of Jupiter.) Hellen had three sons: Dorus, ancestor of the Dorians; Aeolus,father of the Aeolians; and Xanthus, father of Io, from whom descend the Ionicraces. Now it is not easy to speak exactly concerning the ancients to those oflater times, yet is it acknowledged that the Doric is the most ancient of thesedialects. (Orpheus, the most ancient of poets, used the Doric dialect.) A fourthdialect, the Attic, was founded by Creusa daughter of Erechtheus, so named threeages after the rest according to the Thracians, and the rape of Orithuia whichmany histories declare.But perhaps the true reason is because it was the dialect of the country. Forthe Pythagoreans admonished all persons to use the language of their owncountry, what Grecians soever came into their community. For to speak a strangelanguage, they approved not.252 [endnote.xhtml#ftn252] The Doric dialect wascommon throughout Magna Grecia. Crotona and Sybaris were colonies of theAchaeans, Syracuse of the Corinthians; both of which were originally Doric, asbeing of Peloponnesus. Thucydides alleged this as a motive which induced theAthenians to war with the Sicilians, lest being Doreans they should at some timeor other assist the Doreans by reason of their affinity, and being a colony ofthe Peloponnesians, should join with the Peloponnesians.253[endnote.xhtml#ftn253] Hence to the stranger in Theocritus, his Adoniazousai254[endnote.xhtml#ftn254] reproving the Syracusian women thus:Peace foolish babbling women, leave your place;Your wide mouth'd Doric here is out of date.One of them answers,Gup, whence are you? What is our talk to thee?Correct your maids, not us of Sicily.I would you knew it, we are from Corinth sprung,As was Bellerophon, our mother tonguePeloponnesian is, nor is it scornThat they speak Doric who are Doric born.For (says the Scholiast) the Syracusians were originallyCorinthians: Peloponnesus was inhabited by the Doreans,together with the Heraclidae.255 [endnote.xhtml#ftn255]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23HIS DISCIPLESMany were the persons, who from several parts, resorted to Pythagoras, to be hisdisciples and live with him in that condition. Of these there were, asAristoxenus relates, Leucanians, Messapians (or, as Laertius, Peucepetians), andRomans.256 [endnote.xhtml#ftn256]Simichus, tyrant of the Centoropians (a people of Sicily, the town itself beingcalled Centorpa), having heard him, laid down his command and distributed hisriches, part to his sister, part to his citizens. 257 [endnote.xhtml#ftn257]Abaris, also of Scythia, a Hyperborean came hither. He being unacquainted withthe Greek language, and not initiated, and withal advanced into years,Pythagoras would not introduce him by various theorems; but instead of thesilence, and the long attention, and other trials, he made him presently fit toreceive his doctrines, and taught him in a short time to understand those twobooks concerning nature, and concerning the gods.258 [endnote.xhtml#ftn258] ForAbaris now in years, came from the Hyperboreans, a priest of Apollo there; andconverting the wisest things concerning religion from Greece to his own country,that he might lay up the collected gold to his god's use in his temple among theHyperboreans.He came by the way into Italy, and saw Pythagoras, and likened him to the godwhose priest he was, and believed he was no other, not a man like him but veryApollo himself, both by his gravity, and by some marks and tokens which he knew.He gave Pythagoras an arrow which he had brought from the temple as necessaryfor his journey, through so many different contingencies, and such a longtravel. For riding upon that, and so passing over places that were otherwiseimpassible—such as rivers, lakes, marshes, mountains, and the like—and coming toany place, as they say, he made purifications, and expelled pestilences andstorms from those cities that desired his assistance. We are informed, thatLacedaemon being purged by him, never had the pestilence afterwards, whereas itwas formerly very subject to that sickness, by reason of want of free passage ofthe air. (The Taygetan Mountains, amongst which it is built, penning it up. Forthose hills lie above it, as Gnossus to Crete.) And other such signs of thepower of Abaris are reported.259 [endnote.xhtml#ftn259]But Pythagoras, accepting the arrow and not looking strangely upon it, or askingthe cause why he gave it him; but, as if he were himself the true god, takingAbaris aside he showed him his golden thigh, as an assured mark that he was notmistaken. And then, reckoning every particular of all those that were in thetemple, proved that he did not guess amiss. He added that he came for thebenefit of men, and for this reason was in man's shape, that they might not beastonished at one so far above them, and so fly his doctrine. And he commandedAbaris to stay there, and to join with him in instructing them who came to him.As for the gold which Abaris had gathered for his god, Pythagoras commanded himto give it to those whom he had assembled; insomuch that he actually confirmedthe sentence, “All things are common amongst friends.”Abaris thus staying with him (as we said), he gave him the epitome of physiologyand theology. And instead of the art of guessing by sacrifices, he taught himthat kind of Prognostic which is by numbers, as thinking that more sacred anddivine, and more agreeable to the celestial numbers of the gods. And otherdoctrines he taught Abaris, such as were proper for him.Milo of Crotona, the most eminent wrestler of those times, was another discipleto Pythagoras.260 [endnote.xhtml#ftn260] He, when in the hall of the college apillar begun to yield, went under it; and by that means saved all the scholars,and at last got away himself. It is probable that this confidence in his greatstrength was the occasion of his death. For they report that as he was goingthrough a thick wood far from any way, finding a great tree with wedges in it,he set his hand and feet to it, trying to split it asunder; whereupon the wedgesfell out, and he being caught, became a prey to the wild beasts. In his house itwas that the Pythagoreans were surprised and burned by the Cylonians.Calliphon of Crotona, is mentioned by Hermippus as an intimate friend ofPythagoras, who reported when Calliphon was dead, that his soul was continuallypresent with him. He also said that the soul commanded him that he should notpass the place where his ass fell; and that he should abstain from impure water,and avoid ill-speaking.261 [endnote.xhtml#ftn261]We only mention these here as being most particularly interested in the relationof Pythagoras and his life: a more perfect account of the rest, we will add inthe following catalogue.images [images/111_1.png]Sport competitions of many kinds were popular with the ancient Greeks, andwrestling was among the most important.

Nor did he succeed in the school only, but in breeding the childrenof Pythagoras and in the marriage with Theano, for his eminent understanding ofhis opinions. He is said to have taught the doctrine of Pythagoras forty yearstogether lacking one, living in all, near an hundred. Pythagoras assigned theschool to Aristaeus as being the oldest.262 [endnote.xhtml#ftn262]Next him Mnesarchus, son of Pythagoras. He delivered it to Bulagoras, in whosetime the city of Crotona was sacked. He was succeeded by Tidas, a Crotonian,returning from travels he began before the war. But he died with grief for thecalamity of his country; whereas it was a common thing to others, when they werevery old, to free themselves from the fetters of the body. Afterwards they tookone of the Lucanians, saved by some strangers, to be the President of theschool. To him came Diodorus the Aspendian, who was taken by reason of thescarcity of men in their college.At Heraclea, Clinias and Philolaus. At Metapontum, Theorides and Eurytus. AtTarentum, Archytas. One of the external listeners to his discourse wasEpicharmus, who was not of the College. Coming to Syracusa in the time of thetyranny of Hieron, he forbare publicly to profess philosophy; but he reduced theopinions of those men (the Pythagoreans) into verse, sportively divulging theabstruse doctrines of Pythagoras.Of the Pythagoreans it is likely that many were obscure; the names of such aswere eminent, are these:Crotonians: Hippostatus Dymas, Aegon, Aemon, Silius, Cleosthenes, Agelas,Episylus, Phyciadas, Ecphanius, Timaeus, Buthius, Eratus, Itanaus, Phodippus,Bryas, Evander, Millias, Antimedon, Aegas, Leophron, Agylas, Onatus,Hipposthenes, Cleophron, Alcmaeon, Damocles, Milon, Meton.Metapontines: Brontinus, Parmiscus, Arestadas, Leo, Damarmenos, Aeneas, Chilas,Melisias, Aristeas, Laphaon, Evander, Agesidamus, Xenocides, Euriphemus,Aristomenes, Agesarchus, Alcias, Xenophantes, Thraseos, Arytus, Epiphron,Eiriscus, Megistaes, Leocydes, Thrasymides, Euphemus, Proclus, Antimedes,Lacritus, Damotages, Pyrrhon, Rhexibius, Alopecus, Astylus, Dacydus, Aliochus,Lacrates, Glucinus.Agrigentine: Empedocles.Velian: Parmenides.Tartentines: Philolaus, Arytus, Archytas, Theodorus, Aristippus, Lycon,Estiaeus, Polemarchus, Asteas, Caenias.

They say that these stories being acknowledged tobe true—and it being impossible they should all be performed by one man—theyconceive it manifest that these relations are to be ascribed, not to a humanbeing, but to something above mankind. This they acknowledge, for amongst themis a saying:Two-footed Man,266 [endnote.xhtml#ftn266] and BirdIs, and another Third.By the “Third,” they meant Pythagoras. And Aristotle, in his book on Pythagoreanphilosophy, relates, that such a division as this was preserved by thePythagoreans amongst their ineffable secrets.267 [endnote.xhtml#ftn267] Ofrational animals, one kind is God; another, man; a third between both these,Pythagoras.They esteemed Pythagoras in the next place to the gods, as some good geniusindulgent to mankind: some affirming that he was Pythian; others HyperboreanApollo. Some said he was one of those genie which dwell in the Moon; others, oneof the celestial deities appearing at that time in human shape for the benefitand direction of mortal life, that he might communicate the wholesomeillumination of beatitude and philosophy to mortal nature. They affirmed agreater good can never come, nor shall ever come, than that which was given bythe gods through the means of Pythagoras.268 [endnote.xhtml#ftn268] Whence tothis day the proverb of the fair-haired Samian is used for a most reverendperson.Porphyry says they reckoned him amongst the gods.269 [endnote.xhtml#ftn269]Therefore, whenever they went to deliver to others any excellent thing out ofthe secrets of his philosophy—whence many physical conclusions might bededuced—they swore by the Tetractys. And calling Pythagoras, as some God towitness, they said:Who the Tetractys to our Souls express'd,Eternal Nature's Fountain I attest.Which oath they used as forbearing through reverence to name him; for they werevery sparing in using the name of any god.270 [endnote.xhtml#ftn270]So great indeed was the respect they bore him, that it was not lawful for anyoneto doubt of what he said, nor to question him further concerning it. Theyacquiesced in all things that he delivered as if they were oracles.271[endnote.xhtml#ftn271] And when he went abroad to cities, it was reported hewent not to teach, but to cure.Hence it came to pass, that when they asserted anything in dispute, if they werequestioned why it was so, they used to answer, Ipse dixit (“He said it”)—“he”being Pythagoras.272 [endnote.xhtml#ftn272] This images [images/ch1.png] [“Hesaid it”]† was amongst them the first and greatest of doctrines—his judgmentbeing a reason free from and above all examination and censure. 273[endnote.xhtml#ftn273]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE TWO SORTS OF AUDITORS: AND FIRST OF THE EXOTERIC, HOW HE EXPLORED THEMThe Auditors of Pythagoras (such, I mean, as belonged to the family) were of twosorts, exoteric and esoteric. The Exoterics were those who were under probation,which if they performed, they were admitted to Esoterics. For of those who cameto Pythagoras, he admitted not everyone, but only those whom he liked: first,upon choice, and next by trial.The Pythagoreans are said to have been averse to those who sell learning, andopen their souls, like the gates of an Inn, to everyone that comes to them. Andif they find not a vent or sale in this manner, then they run into cities andransack the gymnasia, and exact a reward from dishonorable persons. WhereasPythagoras hid much of his speeches; so only they who were purely initiatedmight plainly understand them.274 [endnote.xhtml#ftn274] But the rest, as Homersaid of Tantalus, grieve, for that being in the midst of learning, they cannottaste of it. Moreover they said that they who for hire teach such as come tothem, are meaner then statuaries and chariotmakers. For a statuary, when hewould make a Mercury, seeks out some piece of wood fit to receive that form; butthese, of every disposition, endeavor to make that of virtue.275[endnote.xhtml#ftn275]When (therefore) any friends came to him, and desired to learn of him, headmitted them not till he had made trial and judgment of them.276[endnote.xhtml#ftn276] First, he enquired how they did heretofore converse withtheir parents and friends; next, he observed their unseasonable laughters, andunnecessary silence or discourse. Moreover, what their inclinations were(whether possessed with passion and intemperance, whether prone to anger orunchaste desires, or contentious or ambitious, and how they behaved themselvesin contention and friendship277 [endnote.xhtml#ftn277]). As likewise whatfriends those were with whom they were intimate, and their conversation withthem, and in whose society they spent the greatest part of the day; likewiseupon what occasions they experienced joy or grief.278 [endnote.xhtml#ftn278]Moreover he considered their presence and their gait, and the whole motion oftheir body. And physiognomizing them by their symptoms, he discovered bymanifest signs the occult dispositions of their souls.279 [endnote.xhtml#ftn279]For he first studied that science concerning men, thereby discovering of whatdisposition everyone was. Neither did he admit any into his friendship andacquaintance before he had physiognomized the man, what he was.280[endnote.xhtml#ftn280] This word (says Aulus Gellius, upon the same occasion)signifies to make enquiry into the manners of some by some kind of conjecture—ofthe wit by the face and countenance, and by the air and habit of the whole body.281 [endnote.xhtml#ftn281]If upon exact observation of all these particulars, he found them to be of gooddispositions, then he examined whether they had good manners, and were docile.First, whether they could readily and ingeniously follow that which he toldthem; next, whether they had any love to those things which they heard.282[endnote.xhtml#ftn282] For he considered what disposition they were as to beingmade gentle. This he called images [images/ch2.png] [“culture”]; for heaccounted roughness an enemy to his way of teaching. Because roughness isattended by impatience, intemperance, anger, obtuseness, confusion, dishonor,and the like; but mildness and gentleness by their contraries.Likewise in making the first trial of them, he considered whether they couldimages [images/ch2_1.png] [“restrain their speech”] (that was the word he used).And he examined whether if they could learn that which they heard, they wereable to be silent and keep it to themselves.283 [endnote.xhtml#ftn283]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3PURIFICATORY INSTITUTION BY SUFFERINGSThe chief goal that Pythagoras proposed was to deliver and free the mind fromthe engagements and fetters in which it is confined from her first infancy.Without which freedom, none can learn anything sound or true, nor can perceiveby what that which is unsound in sense operates.284 [endnote.xhtml#ftn284] Forthe mind (according to him) sees all, and hears all; the rest are deaf andblind.This he performed by many exercises which he appointed for purification of themind, and for the probation of such as came to him, which endured five yearsbefore they were admitted.If upon this examination (which we declared) he judged any person capable, hethen remitted him for three years to be despised, making a test of his constancyand true love to learning, and whether he were sufficiently instructed as todespise glory, to condemn honor, and the like.285 [endnote.xhtml#ftn285]He conceived it, in general, requisite that they should take much labor andpains for the acquisition of arts and sciences. To that end he appointed forthem some torments of cauterizing and incision, to be performed by fire andsteel, which none that were of an ill inclination would undergo.286[endnote.xhtml#ftn286]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4SILENCEMoreover, he imposed upon those that came to him silence for five years, makingtrial how firmly they would behave themselves in the most difficult of allcontingencies; for such is the government of the tongue, as is manifest fromthose who have divulged mysteries.287 [endnote.xhtml#ftn287]This images [images/img1.jpg] a quinquennial silence,† was called images[images/img2.jpg]images [images/img3.jpg] [“restraining speech”], and sometimes,but less frequently, images [images/img4.jpg] [“keeping silent”], images[images/img5.jpg] from keeping our speech within ourselves.†288[endnote.xhtml#ftn288]The reason for this silence was that the soul might be converted into herselfand away from external things—from the irrational passions in her, and from thebody, even unto her own life, which is to live forever.289[endnote.xhtml#ftn289] Or as Clement of Alexandria expresses it, that hisdisciples, being diverted from sensible things, might seek God with a puremind.290 [endnote.xhtml#ftn290] Hence Lucian, to the demand how Pythagoras couldreduce men to the remembrance of the things which they had formerly known (forhe held science to be only reminiscence), makes him answer, “First, by longquiet and silence, speaking nothing for five whole years.”291[endnote.xhtml#ftn291]Yet Aulus Gellius affirms that he appointed not the same length of silence toall, but different periods to several persons according to their particularcapacities.292 [endnote.xhtml#ftn292] And Apuleius says that for the graver sortof persons this taciturnity was moderated by a shorter space; but the moretalkative were punished, as it were, by exile from speech five years.He who kept silence heard what was said by others, but was not allowed either toquestion, if he understood not, or to write down what he heard.293[endnote.xhtml#ftn293] None kept silence less than two years. Agellius adds thatthose within the time of silence and hearing were called Acoustici. But whenthey had learned these things (the most difficult of all to hold their peace andto hear) and were now grown learned in silence, which they called images[images/ch4.png] [“restraining speech”]—then they were allowed to speak, and toquestion, and to write what they heard and what they conceived. At this timethey were called Mathematici, from those arts which they then began to learn andto mediate. Thus says Agellus, although how rightly I question. For Mathematiciand Acousmatici were distinctive appellations of the Pythagoreans, not inprobation but after admission, as we shall see hereafter.Thus Apuleius says Pythagoras taught nothing to his disciples before silence.And that the first meditation for one who meant to become a wise man was whollyto refrain the tongue of words—those words which the poets call “winged,” topluck off the feathers and to confine them within the walls of our teeth.294[endnote.xhtml#ftn294] This was the first rudiment of wisdom, to learn tomeditate, and to unlearn to talk."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5ABSTINENCE, TEMPERANCE, AND OTHER WAYS OF PURIFICATIONMoreover, he commanded them to abstain from all foods that had life, and fromcertain other meats also which obstruct the clearness of the understanding.295[endnote.xhtml#ftn295] And for the same end (viz. in order to aid theinquisition and apprehension of the most difficult theorems), he likewisecommanded them to abstain from wine; to eat little; to sleep little; to show acareless contempt of honor, riches, and the like; to offer an unfeigned respecttowards kindred—sincere equality and kindness towards such as were of the sameage, and a propensity to further the younger without envy.In fine, he procured to his disciples a conversation with the gods by visionsand dreams—which never happen to a soul disturbed with anger or pleasure, or anyother unbefitting transportation, or with impurity, or rigid ignorance.296[endnote.xhtml#ftn296] He cleansed and purified the soul divinely from allthese; and enkindled the divine part in her and preserved her; and directed inher that intellectual divine eye which is better, as Plato says, than a thousandeyes of flesh. For by the help of this only, truth is apprehended.297[endnote.xhtml#ftn297] After this manner he procured purification of theintellect. And such was his form of institution as to those things.Diodorus says they had an exercise of temperance that worked in the followingmanner.298 [endnote.xhtml#ftn298] There being prepared and set before them allsorts of delicate food, they looked upon it a good while; and after theirappetites were fully provoked by the sight thereof, they commanded it to betaken off and given to the servants.299 [endnote.xhtml#ftn299] They themselveswent away without dining. This they did, says Iamblichus, to punish theirappetite."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6COMMUNITY OF ESTATESIn this time, all that they had (that is their whole estate) was made common,that is, put together communally.300 [endnote.xhtml#ftn300] They brought forth,says Aulus Gellius, whatsoever they had of stock or money and constituted aninseparable society, as being that ancient way of association which truly istermed images [images/ch6.png] [“life in community”].301 [endnote.xhtml#ftn301]This was given up to such of the disciples as were appointed for that purpose.These were called Politici and Economici, as being persons fit to govern afamily and to give laws.This was conformable to the precepts of Pythagoras (as Timeus affirms): firstimages [images/ch6_1.png] all common amongst friends; and images[images/ch6_2.png] friendship, equality;302 [endnote.xhtml#ftn302] and, esteemnothing your own. By this means he exterminated all propriety and increasedcommunity even to their last possessions. He sought thus to eliminatepossessions as a cause of dissension and trouble; for, since all things werecommon amongst them, no man had a propriety to anything.303[endnote.xhtml#ftn303]But what Aulus Gellius terms an “inseparable society” is to be understood onlyconditionally. If someone misliked this community, he took again his own estate,and more than that which he brought into the community, and departed.304[endnote.xhtml#ftn304]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7ADMISSION OR REJECTIONThey who appeared worthy to participate of his doctrines—judging by their livesand moderation after their five years silence—were made Esoterics and admittedto hear Pythagoras within the screen and to see him.305 [endnote.xhtml#ftn305]But before that time, they heard him discourse, being on the outside of thescreen, and not seeing him—given a long time experiment of their proper mannersby hearing only.But if they were rejected, they received their estate double, and a tomb wasmade by the disciples as if they had been dead. For so all that were aboutPythagoras spoke of them; and when they met them, behaved themselves towardsthem as if they had been some other persons; but the men themselves they saidwere dead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8DISTINCTIONWhatsoever he discoursed to those that came to him, he declared either plainlyor symbolically (for he had a twofold form of teaching). And of those who cameto him, some were called Mathematici, others Acousmatici.306[endnote.xhtml#ftn306] The Mathematici were those who learned the fuller andmore exactly elaborate reason of science. The Acousmatici were they who heardonly the chief heads of learning without more exact explication.Thus, as there were two kinds of Philosophy, so were there two sorts of thosewho studied philosophy.307 [endnote.xhtml#ftn307] The Acousmatici did confessthat the Mathematici were Pythagoreans. But the Mathematici did not acknowledgethat the Acousmatici were Pythagoreans; for they had their learning, not fromPythagoras, but from Hippasus; who, some say, was of Crotona, others ofMetapontium.The philosophy of the Acousmatici consists of doctrines without demonstrationsand reasons; rather being told that this is how it must be done and the like.These they were to observe as so many divine doctrines, and they did esteemthose amongst them the wisest who had most of these Acousmata. Now Acousmatawere divided into three kinds: some tell what something is; others tell what ismost such a thing; the third sort tell what is to be done and what not.Those that tell what a thing is are of this kind: as what is the Island of theBlessed? The Sun? the Moon? What is the Oracle at Delphi? The Tetractys? What isthe Music of the Syrens?Those which tell what is most such as: What is most just? To sacrifice. What isthe wisest? Number, and in the next place that which gave names to things. Whatis the wisest amongst us? Medicine. What the most beautiful? Harmony. What themost powerful? Reason. What the best? Beatitude. What the truest? That men arewicked. For which (they say) he commended Hippodamas, a Poet of Salamis, whosaid,O Gods! whence are you? How so good? so Blessed?O Men! whence are you? How with ill possessed?These, and such like, are the Acousmata of this kind. For every one of thesetells what is most. The same it is with that which is called the “wisdom of theseven sages.” For they enquired not what is good, but what is most good; notwhat is difficult, but what is most difficult (which is to know ourselves); notwhat is facile, but what is most facile (which is the custom of nations). ThoseAcousmata seem to follow this kind of wisdom for those sages were beforePythagoras.The Acousmata which tell what is to be done, or what is not to be done, arethus: As that we ought to beget children, for we must leave behind us such asmay serve the gods in our stead; or, that we ought to put off the right shoefirst; or, that we ought not to go in the common road, and the like. Such werethe Acousmata. But those which have had the most said about them are concerningsacrifices: at what times, and after what manner they are to be performed; andconcerning removal from our place of habitation; and concerning sepulture, howwe must bury the dead.For some, there is a reason given. As that we ought to get children, that we mayleave in our room another servant of the gods. But of others there is no reason.And in some, that which follows the precept seems to be allied to the words; butin others is wholly distant. An example is that we ought not to break bread,because it conduces to judgment in Hell. But the reasons that are applied tothese are not Pythagorean, but given by some other who studied Pythagoreanlearning, endeavoring to apply some probable conjecture to them. As of the lastmentioned, that bread is not to be broken, some say: He who gathers together,ought not to dissolve. For anciently all friends used after a barbarous mannerto meet at one loaf; others, that you must not give so bad an omen as when youare going about anything to break it off.But there was one Hippomedon, an Agrinean,308 [endnote.xhtml#ftn308] aPythagorean of the Acousmatic rank, who said that Pythagoras gave reasons anddemonstrations of all these things. But because they were delivered by traditionthrough many, and those still growing more idle, that the reasons were takenaway, and the problems only left.Now the mathematical Pythagoreans grant all this to be true, but the occasion ofthe difference they say was this. Pythagoras went from Ionia and Samos, duringPolycrates's reign, to Italy, which was then in a flourishing condition, andwhere the chief persons of the cities became conversant with him. To the mostancient of these, and such as had least leisure (because they were taken up withpublic employments, so that it would be very hard for them to learn mathematicsand demonstrations), he discoursed barely. He conceived it did nothing lessadvantage them, even without the causes, to know what they had to do—aspatients, not enquiring why such things are prescribed them, nevertheless obtainhealth. But to the younger, who were able to act and learn, he imparted bydemonstrations and mathematics. The Mathematici professed that they came fromthese; the Acousmatici from the others, chiefly from Hippasus who was one of thePythagoreans. But because Hippasus published their doctrine and first wrote ofthe sphere of twelve pentagons, he died in the sea as an impious person, notobtaining the same at which he aimed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9HOW THEY DISPOSED THE DAYWe shall next speak concerning those things which he taught them in the day. Foraccording to his directions, thus did they who were taught by him.309[endnote.xhtml#ftn309]These men performed their morning walks by themselves, and in such places wherethey might be exceeding quiet and retired. These were temples and groves andother delightful places. For they thought it was not fit they should speak withanyone till they had first composed their souls and fitted their intellect—andthat such quiet was requisite for the composure of their intellect. For as soonas they arose, to intrude among the people they thought a tumultuous thing.Therefore all the Pythagoreans ever made choice of the most sacred places.After their morning walk, they came to one another chiefly in the temples, or insome such places. They made use of these times for doctrines and disciplines,and rectifications of their manners.After they had studied awhile, they went to their morning exercises. The greaterpart used to anoint themselves and run races; the fewer, to wrestle in orchardsand in groves. Some by throwing sledges, or by grappling hands, to make trial oftheir strength—choosing such exercises as they judged most convenient for them.At dinner they used bread and honey. Wine after meals they drunk not. The timeafter dinner they employed in political affairs—as well foreign as domestic,according to the injunction of their laws; for they endeavored to manageeverything in the afternoons.As soon as the evening came, they betook themselves again, not singly as intheir morning walks, but two or three walked together, repeating the doctrinesthey had learnt and exercising themselves in virtuous employments. After theirwalks, they used baths and washing. Having washed, they met together to eat; butthey did not eat together more than ten persons. As soon as they who were tocome together were met, they used libations and sacrifices of meal andfrankincense. Then they went to supper, that they might end it before the Sunwere set. They used wine, and grain, and bread, and broth, and herbs, both rawand boiled. They likewise set before them the flesh of such beasts as used to besacrificed. They seldom ate broths of fish, because some of them are in somerespects very hurtful; likewise (seldom) the flesh of such creatures as use notto hurt mankind.After supper they offered libations, then had lectures. Their custom was thatthe youngest amongst them should read, and the eldest should, as president,order what and how he should read. When they were to depart, he who filled thewine poured forth to them in libation. And during the libation, the eldest ofthem declared these things: that none should hurt or kill a domestic plant orfruit; besides, that they should speak well and think reverently of the gods,daemons, and heroes; likewise to think well of parents and benefactors; toassist law and oppose rebellion. This said, everyone departed to his house.They wore a white and clean garment; they had also coverlets—white and clean—oflinen; for they used not any of skins, because they approved not the exercise ofhunting.310 [endnote.xhtml#ftn310]These were the traditions that were delivered to that society of men, partlyconcerning diet (of which hereafter more particularly), partly concerning thecourse of life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10HOW THEY EXAMINED THEIR ACTIONS MORNING AND EVENINGThese and all other actions of the day they contrived in the morning before theyrose, and examined at night before they slept; thus, by a twofold act,exercising the memory.311 [endnote.xhtml#ftn311] They conceived that it wasrequisite to retain and preserve in memory all which they learned; and thatlessons and doctrines should be so far acquired as they are able to rememberwhat they have learned; for that is it which they ought to know and bear inmind. For this reason they cherished memory much, and exercised it, and tookgreat care of it; and in learning they gave not over until they had gotten theirlesson perfectly by heart.A Pythagorean rose not out of bed before he had called to mind the actions ofthe day past, which recollection he performed in this manner. He endeavored tocall to mind what he first had either heard or given in charge to his servantsas soon as he rose; and what in the second place, and what in the third, and soon in the same order. And then for his going forth, whom he met first, whomnext; and what discourses he had with the first, what with the second, what withthe third, and so of the rest; for he endeavored to repeat in memory all thathappened throughout the whole day in order as it happened. And if at theirup-rising they had more leisure, then after the same manner they endeavored torecollect all that happened to them for three days before. Thus they chieflyexercised the memory.312 [endnote.xhtml#ftn312] For they conceived that nothingconduces more to science, experience, and prudence than to remember many things.This was conformable to the institution of Pythagoras. For he advised to haveregard chiefly to two times: that when we went to sleep, and that when we rosefrom sleep. At each of these we ought to consider what actions are past, andwhat to come.313 [endnote.xhtml#ftn313] Of the past, we ought to require anaccount of ourselves; of the future, we ought to have a providential care.Wherefore he advised everyone to repeat to himself these verses as soon as hecame home or before he slept.314 [endnote.xhtml#ftn314]Nor suffer sleep at night to close thine eyes,Till thrice thy acts that day thou hast reviewed,How slipped? what deeds? what duty left undone?And before they arose, these:As soon as thou wakest, in order layThe actions to be done that following day.To this effect, Ausonius has a Pythagorean Discourse as he terms it.A good wise person, such as hardly oneOf many thousands to Apollo known,He his own judge strictly himself surveys,Nor minds the Noble's or the Common's ways:But, like the world itself, is smooth and round,In all his polished frame no blemish found.He thinks how long Cancer the day extends,And Capricorn the night. Himself perpendsIn a just balance, that no flaw where be,Nothing exuberant, but that all agree;Within that all be solid, nothing byA hollow sound betray vacuity.Nor suffer sleep to seize his eyes, beforeAll acts of that long day he has run o're;What things were missed, what done in time, what not;Why here respect, or reason there forgot;Why kept the worse opinion? when reliev'dA beggar; why with broken passion griev'd;What wish'd which had been better not desir'd;Why profit before honesty requir'd?If any by some speech or look offended,Why nature more than discipline attended?All words & deeds thus searched from morn to night,He sorrows for the ill, rewards the right."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11SECRECYBesides the quinquennial silence, images [images/ch11.png],† of the Pythagoreanswhile they were Exoterics, there was another termed images [images/ch11_1.png],a perpetual or complete silence (or secrecy) proper to the Esoterics—not amongstone another, but towards all such as were not of their society.The principal and most efficacious of their doctrines they all kept ever amongstthemselves as not to be spoken, with exact Echemythia towards extraneouspersons; continuing them unwritten and preserved only by memory to theirsuccessors, to whom they delivered them as mysteries of the gods. By whichmeans, nothing of any moment came abroad from them.315 [endnote.xhtml#ftn315]What had been taught and learned for a long time, was only known within thewalls; and, if at any time there were any extraneous, and as I may say, profanepersons amongst them, the Men (so commonly were the Pythagoreans termed)expressed their meaning to one another by Symbols.Hence Lysis, reproving Hipparchus for communicating the discourse to uninitiatedpersons void of mathematics and theory, says:They report, that you teach philosophy in public to all that come, whichPythagoras would not do, as you, Hipparchus, learned with much pains.316[endnote.xhtml#ftn316] But you took no heed after you had tasted (O nobleperson) the Sicilian delicacies, which you ought not to have tasted a secondtime. If you are changed, I shall rejoice. If not, you are dead to me; for hesaid, “We ought to remember, that it is pious, according to the direction ofdivine and human exhortations, that the goods of wisdom ought not to becommunicated to those whose soul is not purified so much as in dream.”For it is not lawful to bestow on everyone that which was acquired with so muchlabor, nor to reveal the mysteries of the Eleusian goddesses to profane persons.For they who do both these are alike unjust and irreligious. It is good toconsider without ourselves, how much time was employed in taking away the spotsthat were in our beasts, that after five years we might be made capable of hisdiscourses. For as dyers first wash and wring out the clothes they intend todye—that they may take the dye so as that it can never be washed out or takenaway—in like manner the divine prepared those who were inclined to philosophy,lest he might be deceived by those of whom he hoped that they would prove goodand honest.For he used no adulterate learning, nor the nets wherewith many of the Sophistsentangle the young men; but he was skillful in things divine and human. Whereasthey, under the pretence of his doctrine, do many strange things, inveigling theyoung men unbeseemingly, and as they meet them, whereby they render theirauditors rough and rash. For they infuse free theorems and discourse intomanners that are not free but disordered. As if into a deep well full of dirtand mire we should put clear transparent water. It troubles the dirt and spoilsthe water. The same is it as to those who teach and are taught; for about theminds and hearts of such as are not initiated, there grow thick and tall covertswhich darken all modesty and meekness and reason, hindering it from increasingthere.Hence spring all kinds of ills, growing up and hindering the reason, and notsuffering it to look out. I will first name their mothers, Intemperance andAvarice, both exceedingly fruitful. From intemperance spring up unlawfulmarriages, lust, drunkenness, perdition, unnatural pleasures, and certainvehement appetites leading to death and ruin. For some have been so violentlycarried away with pleasures that they have not refrained from their own mothersand daughters; but violating the commonwealth and the laws, tyrannicallyimprison men, and carrying about their Jalles317 [endnote.xhtml#ftn317] (orstocks) violently, hurry them to destruction.From avarice proceed rapines, thefts, parricides, sacrileges, poisonings, andwhatsoever is allied to these. It behooves therefore first to cut away thematter wherein these vices are bred with fire and sword, and all arts ofdiscipline—purifying and freeing the reason from these evils—and then to plantsomething that is good in it.Thus Lysis. Neither is that expression, “If you are not changed, you are dead tome,” to be understood simply. For this, Hipparchus, because he communicated andpublicly set forth by writing the Pythagorean doctrines, was expelled from theschool, and a tomb was made for him as if he were dead (according to the customformerly mentioned).318 [endnote.xhtml#ftn318] So strict were the Pythagoreansin observance of this secrecy."},{"pageContent":"Part ThreeThe Doctrine of PythagorasSection I.

MathematicsTHE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES PREPARATIVE TO PHILOSOPHYThe mind being purified by discipline ought to be applied to things that arebeneficial.319 [endnote.xhtml#ftn319] These Pythagoras procured by somecontrived ways, bringing it by degrees to the contemplation of eternalincorporeal things which are ever in the same state. He began this in an orderlymanner from the most minute—lest by the suddenness of the change, it should bediverted and withdraw itself through its so great and long habit of perversemental nutriment.To this end, he first used the mathematical sciences, and those speculationswhich are intermediate between corporeals and incorporeals (for they have athreefold dimension like bodies, but they are impassible like Incorporeals) asdegrees of preparation to the contemplation of the things that are. They divert,by an artificial reason, the eyes of the mind from corporeal things (which neverare permanent in the same manner and estate), never so little to a desire ofaliment. By means whereof, introducing the contemplation of things that are, herendered men truly happy. This is the use he made of the mathematical sciences.Hence it was that Justin Martyr, applying himself to a Pythagorean eminentlylearned, desirous to be his disciple, the teacher demanded whether he wereversed in music, astronomy, and geometry. “Or do you think,” says he, “you maybe able to understand anything that pertains to beatitude without having firstlearned these, which abstract the soul from sensibles, preparing and adaptingher for her intelligibles? Can you without these contemplate what is honest andwhat is good?” Thus, after a long commendation of these sciences, he dismissedhim, for that he had confessed himself ignorant of them.320[endnote.xhtml#ftn320]Mathematics, Its Name and PartsThese sciences were first termed images [images/r.png] [“mathematics”] byPythagoras, upon consideration that all mental discipline is Reminiscence. Thiscomes not extrinsically to souls, as the phantasies, which are formed bysensible objects in the Imaginal world. Nor are they an advantageous acceptedknowledge, like that which is placed in opinion. But it is excited fromphenomena, and perfected intrinsically by the cogitation converted intoitself.321 [endnote.xhtml#ftn321]The whole science of mathematics, the Pythagoreans divided into fourparts—attributing one to multitude, another to magnitude, and subdividing eachof these into two.322 [endnote.xhtml#ftn322] For multitude either subsists byitself, or is considered with respect to another. Magnitude either stands still,or is moved. Arithmetic contemplates multitude in self; music with respect toanother; geometry, unmovable magnitude; and trigonometry, moveable.These sciences consider not multitude and magnitude simply,323[endnote.xhtml#ftn323] but in each of these, that which is determinate. Forsciences consider this abstracted from infinite; that they may not in vainattempt in each of these that which is infinite.324 [endnote.xhtml#ftn324] Whentherefore the wise persons say thus, we conceive it is not to be understood ofthat multitude which is in the sensible things themselves, nor of that magnitudewhich we perceive in bodies. For the contemplation of these, I think, pertainsto Physic, not to mathematic. But the Maker of all things took union anddivision, identity and otherness, and station and motion, to complete thesoul—and framed it of these kinds, as Timaeus teaches.We must conceive therefore that the intellect—consisting according to thediversity thereof, and the division of proportions and multitude, and knowingitself to be both one and many—proposes number to itself; and produces them andthe arithmetical knowledge of them. According to the union of multitude andcommunication with itself, and conjunction, it brings to itself music. For whichreason, arithmetic excels music in antiquity, the soul itself being firstdivided by the Maker, then collected by proportions. And again, establishing theoperation within itself according to its station, it produces geometry out ofitself, and one figure, and the principles of all figures. But according to itsmotion, trigonometry: for she is moved by circles. It consists always in thesame manner according to the causes of those circles, the straight and thecircular. And for this reason, likewise geometry is precedent to Trigonometry,as station is to motion.But forasmuch as the soul produced these sciences—not looking on the excitationof Ideas, which is of infinite power, but upon the boundary of that which islimited in their several kinds325 [endnote.xhtml#ftn325]—therefore they say thatthey take infinite from multitude and magnitude, and are conversant only aboutfinite. For the mind has placed in herself all principles both of multitude andmagnitude; because being wholly of like parts within herself, and being one andindivisible, and again divisible and producing the world of ideas; it does shareessential finiteness and infiniteness with the things which it does understand.But it understands according to that which is finite in them, and not accordingto the infiniteness of its life. This is the opinion of the Pythagoreans, andtheir division of the four sciences. Hitherto Proclus."},{"pageContent":"ARITHMETICOf these four methods, which is that which ought necessarily to be learned thefirst (viz. that which is by nature pre-existent to the rest and chief, being asit were principle and root, and mother of the rest)?326 [endnote.xhtml#ftn326]The answer is Arithemetic. Not only because it is pre-existent before the restin the Intellect of the efficient God, as an ornative and exemplaryreason—according to which the Maker of the Universe caused all things to be madeout of matter to its proper end, as after a images [images/f.png] [“a thingpricked,” i.e. “traced out beforehand”]† and archetypal pattern. But alsobecause being naturally first generated,327 [endnote.xhtml#ftn327] it togethertakes away the rest with itself, but is not taken away with them. Thus animal isfirst in nature before man. For taking away animal, we take away man; but not intaking away man, do we take away animal. (Of this Nicomachus discourses morelargely.)As concerning Arithmetic, Timaeus affirms that Pythagoras addicted himselfchiefly to it.328 [endnote.xhtml#ftn328] Stobaeus says that he esteemed it aboveall others, and brought it to light, reducing it from the use of trading.329[endnote.xhtml#ftn329] Hence Isidore and others style him the inventor ofarithmetic,330 [endnote.xhtml#ftn330] affirming he was the first who wrote uponthis subject amongst the Greeks, which was afterwards more copiously composed byNicomachus. He studied this science exceedingly, and so much did he prefer itabove all the rest, that he conceived the ultimate good of man to consist in themost exact science of numbers.331 [endnote.xhtml#ftn331]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1NUMBER, ITS KINDS: THE FIRST KIND, INTELLECTUAL IN THE DIVINE MINDNumber is of two kinds, the Intellectual (or immaterial) and the Sciential.332[endnote.xhtml#ftn332] The intellectual is that eternal substance of numberwhich Pythagoras, in his discourse concerning the gods, asserted to be theprinciple most providential of all Heaven and Earth and the nature that isbetween them.333 [endnote.xhtml#ftn333] Moreover, it is the root of divinebeings, and of gods, and of daemons. This is that which he termed the principle,fountain, and root of all things. He defined it to be that which before allthings exists in the Divine Mind;334 [endnote.xhtml#ftn334] from which and outof which all things are digested into order, and remain numbered by anindissoluble series.335 [endnote.xhtml#ftn335]For all things which are ordered in the world by nature—according to anartificial course in part and in whole—appear to be distinguished and adorned byProvidence and the All-creating Mind according to number. The exemplar isestablished by applying (as the reason of the principle before the impression ofthings) the number pre-existent in the intellect of God, Maker of the world.This only in intellectual, and wholly immaterial, really a substance accordingto which as being the most exact artificial reason, all things areperfected—Time, Heaven, Motion, the Stars—and their various revolutions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE OTHER KIND OF NUMBER: SCIENTIAL, ITS PRINCIPLESSciential number is that which Pythagoras defines as the extension andproduction into act of the seminal reasons which are in the Monad, or a heap ofMonads, or a progression of multitude beginning from Monad, and a regressionending in Monad.336 [endnote.xhtml#ftn336]The Pythagoreans affirmed the expositive terms whereby even and odd numbers areunderstood to be the principles of Sciential numbers.337 [endnote.xhtml#ftn337]For example, of three insensible things, the Triad; of four Insensibles, theTetrad; and so of other numbers.They make a difference between the Monad and One, conceiving the Monad to bethat which exists in intellectuals. One exists in numbers.338[endnote.xhtml#ftn338] (Or as Moderatus expresses it, Monad amongst numbers, Oneamongst things numbered, one body being divisible into infinite. Thus numbersand things numbered differ, as incorporeals and bodies.339[endnote.xhtml#ftn339])In like manner is two amongst numbers. The Duad is indeterminate. Monad is takenaccording to equality and measure, Duad according to excess and defect. Mean andmeasure cannot admit more and less, but excess and defect (seeing that theyproceed to infinite) admit it. Therefore they call the Duad indeterminate,holding number to be infinite.340 [endnote.xhtml#ftn340] Not that number whichis separate and incorporeal, but that which is not separate from sensiblethings.341 [endnote.xhtml#ftn341]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE TWO KINDS OF SCIENTIAL NUMBER, ODD AND EVENOf sciential numbers, Pythagoras asserted two orders: one bounded, Odd; theother infinite, Even.342 [endnote.xhtml#ftn342] Even number (according to thePythagorean definition) is that which at once admits division into the greatestand the least; into the greatest magnitudes (for halves are the greatest parts);the least in multitude (for two is the least number) according to the naturalopposition of these two kinds.343 [endnote.xhtml#ftn343] Odd is that whichcannot suffer this, but is cut into two unequals.Herein the Pythagoreans differ from the Platonists, in that they hold not allnumber to be infinite, but only the Even. For even number is the cause ofsection into equal parts, which is infinite, and by its proper nature generatesinfinity in those things in which it exists.344 [endnote.xhtml#ftn344] But it islimited by the Odd; for that being applied to the Even, hinders its dissectioninto two equal parts.Odd number is said to have been found by Pythagoras to be of Masculinevirtue,345 [endnote.xhtml#ftn345] and proper to the Celestial Gods (to whom theysacrificed always of that number), 346 [endnote.xhtml#ftn346] and to be full andperfect.347 [endnote.xhtml#ftn347] Even number is indigent, and imperfect, andFemale, and proper to the subterranean deities, to whom they sacrificed Eventhings.348 [endnote.xhtml#ftn348]Moreover, whatever is generated of Odd number is male, whatsoever of Even isfemale; for Even number is subject to section and passion. Odd is void of both,and is efficacious. Wherefore they call one the Male, the other the Female.349[endnote.xhtml#ftn349] A number, which arises out of the power andmultiplication of Even and Odd, is called images [images/img1.png]Hermaphrodite.350 [endnote.xhtml#ftn350]This opinion Pythagoras seems to have derived from Zaratas, his Master. Hecalled Duad the Mother of number, Monad the Father; and therefore they said thatthose numbers which resemble Monad (viz. the Odd), are the best.351[endnote.xhtml#ftn351]Odd Numbers they called Gnomons, because being added to Squares, they keep thesame figures; so Gnomons do in Geometry.352 [endnote.xhtml#ftn352]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4SYMBOLIC NUMBERSThe Pythagoreans, using the mathematical sciences as degrees of preparations tothe contemplations of the things that are, were studiously addicted to thebusiness of numbers for this reason. (So says Moderatus of Gades, who learnedlycomprised their opinions in eleven books.353 [endnote.xhtml#ftn353])Seeing they could not clearly explain the first forms and principles indiscourse (those being the most difficult to understand and express), they hadrecourse to numbers for the better explication of their doctrine, imitatinggeometricians and such as teach to read. For as these, going about to explainletters and their powers, recur to marks—saying that these are, as it were, thefirst elements of learning—nevertheless, afterwards they tell us that they arenot the elements, but that the true elements are known by them. And as thegeometricians, not being able to express incorporeal forms in words, haverecourse to the description of figures saying, “This is a triangle”; yet notmeaning that this which falls under the sight is a triangle, but that which hasthe same figure and which is by the help thereof, and represents the knowledgeof a triangle to the mind.The same did the Pythagoreans in the first reasons and forms. For seeing theycould not in words express incorporeal forms and first principles, they hadrecourse to demonstration by numbers. And thus they called the reason of unityand identity, and equality, and the cause of amicable conspiration, and ofsympathy, and of the conservation of the universe which continues according tothe same, and in the same manner, ONE. For the One which is in particulars, isunited to the parts and conspiring by participation of the first cause.But the two-fold reason of diversity and inequality, and of every thing that isdivisible and in mutation, and exists sometimes one way, sometimes another, theycalled DUAD. For the nature of the Duad in particular things is such.images [images/147.jpg]These reasons are not only according to the Pythagoreans, and not acknowledgedby others; but we see that other philosophers also have left certain unitivepowers, which comprise all things in the Universe. And amongst them there arecertain reasons for equality, dissimilitude, and diversity. Now thesereasons—that the way of teaching might be more perspicuous—he called by thenames of Monad and Duad. But it is all one amongst them if it be called biform,or aequaliform, or diversiform.The same reason is in other numbers, for everyone is ranked according to somepowers. In the nature of things exists something which has beginning, middle andend. To such a form and nature they attributed the number Three, saying thatwhatsoever has a middle is triform; so they called every perfect thing. And ifanything be perfect, they affirm it makes use of this principle and is adornedaccording to it; which, since they could not name otherwise, they made use ofthe term TRIAD to express it. And when they endeavor to bring us to theknowledge thereof, they lead us to it by the form of this triad. The same inother numbers.These, therefore, are the reasons according to which the aforesaid numbers wereplaced. But these that follow are comprehended under one form and power, whichthey call Decad quasi Dechad.354 [endnote.xhtml#ftn354] Wherefore they say thatten is a perfect number, even the most perfect of all numbers; comprehending initself all difference of numbers, all reasons, species, and proportions. For ifthe nature of the universe be defined according to the reasons and proportionsof numbers—and that which is produced, and increased, and perfected, proceedsaccording to the reasons of numbers—and the Decad comprehends every reason ofnumber, and every proportion, and all species: Why should not nature itself betermed by the name of Ten, the most perfect number? Hitherto Moderatus.Thus, from the symbolical use of numbers proceeded a multiplex variety of names,attributed to them by Pythagoras and his followers. Of which we shall now speakmore particularly, beginning with the Monad."},{"pageContent":"images [images/149.jpg]CHAPTER 5THE MONADThe Monad is a quantity, which in the decrease of multitude, being deprived ofall number, receives mansion and station.

They are, for thatreason, the empyreal prefecture; they go round about the world as the Empyreanpasses through all.446 [endnote.xhtml#ftn446]Even God himself Pythagoras expressed by the Tetrad.How God is a Tetrad, you will clearly find in the sacred discourse ascribed toPythagoras, wherein God is described as the number of numbers.447[endnote.xhtml#ftn447] For if all beings subsist by his eternal counsel, it ismanifest, that number in every species of beings depends upon their causes. Thefirst number is there, from thence derived hither. The determinate stop ofnumber is the Decad, for he who would reckon further, must return to one, two,three, and number a second Decad. In like manner, a third to make up thirty, andso on; till having numbered the tenth Decad, he comes to a 100. Again, hereckons from 100 in the same manner, and so may proceed to infinite byrevolution of the Decad.Now the Tetrad is the power of the Decad; for, before we arrive at theperfection of the Decad, we find a united perfection in the Tetrad—the Decadbeing made up by addition of one, two, three, and four.Moreover, the Tetrad is an arithmetical mean between one and seven, equallyexceeding and exceeded in number. It wants three of seven, and exceeds one bythree. Monad, as being the mother of numbers, contains all their powers withinitself.images [images/156.png]The Hebdomad [i.e., the number seven]—as being motherless, and avirgin—possesses the second place in dignity. For it is not made up of anynumber within the Decad—as four is of twice two; six of twice three; eight oftwice four; nine thrice three; and ten of twice five. Neither does it make upany number within the Decad—as two makes four; three makes six; five makes ten.But the Tetrad, lying between the unbegotten Monad and the motherless Hebdomad,comprehends all powers, both of the productive and produced numbers. For this ofall numbers under ten is made of a certain number, and makes a certain number;the Duad doubled makes a Tetrad, the Tetrad doubled makes eight.Besides, the first solid figure is found in a Tetrad. For a point iscorrespondent to Monad, a line to Duad (because drawn from one point toanother), a superficies to Triad (because it is the most simple of allrectilinear figures). But a solid properly agrees with the Tetrad. For the firstpyramid is in a Tetrad; the base is triangular, so that at the bottom is athree, at the top one.Furthermore, the judicative power in things is four: mind, science, opinion, andsense. For all beings are determined to be either mind, science, opinion, orsense. For which reason Pythagoras affirmed the soul of man to consist of aTetrad.448 [endnote.xhtml#ftn448]Finally, the Tetrad connects all beings, elements, numbers, seasons of the year,Coaevous society. Neither can we name anything which depends not on theTetractys as its root and principle. For it is, as we have said, the maker andcause of all things—intelligible God, author of celestial and sensible good. Theknowledge of these things was delivered to the Pythagoreans by Pythagorashimself. Hitherto Hierocles.For this reason the word “Tetractys” was used by Pythagoras and his disciples asa great oath. They, likewise, out of respect to their master, forbearing hisname, did swear by the person that communicated the Tetractys to them.Eternal Nature's Fountain I attest,Who the Tetractys to our Soul express't.But Plutarch interprets this Tetractys (which he says was also called images[images/img4.png], World) to be thirty-six, which consists of the first four oddnumbers, thus:449 [endnote.xhtml#ftn449]images [images/157_1.png]The names of the Tetrad are these:Another Goddess, Multideity, Pantheos, Fountain of Natural Effects.450[endnote.xhtml#ftn450]Key-keeper of Nature: because the universal constitution cannot be without it.To these sciences it confers constitution and settlement, and reconciles them.Yea, it is nature itself and truth.451 [endnote.xhtml#ftn451]Nature of Aeolus452 [endnote.xhtml#ftn452] from its various property.453[endnote.xhtml#ftn453]Hercules, Impetuosity, Most Strong, Masculine, Ineffeminate, Mercury, Vulcan,Bacchus, Soritas, Maiades, Erinnius, Socus, Dioscorus, Bassarius, Two-mother'd,of Feminine Form, of Virile performance, Bacchation.454 [endnote.xhtml#ftn454]Harmony455 [endnote.xhtml#ftn455] because it has a sesquitertia.456[endnote.xhtml#ftn456]Urania the Muse.457 [endnote.xhtml#ftn457] World.458 [endnote.xhtml#ftn458]Body: as a Point is one, a Line two, a Superficies three.Soul, because it consists of mind, science, opinion and sense.459[endnote.xhtml#ftn459]First Profundity, as it is a body.460 [endnote.xhtml#ftn460]Justice. The property of justice is compensation and equality. This number isthe first evenly even. And whatsoever is the first in any kind is most thatthing.

This he notonly practiced himself, but communicated to his disciples—as is manifest fromIamblichus, who cites this fragment of the Sacred Discourse, a book ascribed tohim.“Concerning the gods of Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, I learned this when I wasinitiated at Libeth in Thrace, Aglaophemus administering the rites to me.Orpheus, son of Calliope, instructed by his mother in the Pangaean mountain,said that number is an eternal substance, the most provident principle of theuniverse: heaven, and earth, and middle nature; likewise the root of divinebeings, and of gods and daemons.” 581 [endnote.xhtml#ftn581]Hence (says Iamblichus) it is manifest that Pythagoras received from thetraditions of Orpheus the doctrine that numbers hold the determinate essence ofthe gods. By these numbers he framed a wonderful system of divination andservice of the gods. This had the closest affinity to numbers, as may be evincedfrom hence (for it is requisite to give an instance for confirmation of what wesay).The student of Pythagoras, Abaris, performed those kinds of sacrifices to whichhe was accustomed, and diligently practiced divination after the ways of theBarbarians by victims (principally of cocks, whose entrals they conceived to bemost exact for inspection). Pythagoras, not willing to take him away from hisstudy of truth; yet, in order to direct him by a safer way, without blood andslaughter (moreover esteeming the cock sacred to the Sun), taught Abaris to findout all truth by the science of arithmetic.582 [endnote.xhtml#ftn582] Thus saysIamblichus, who writes elsewhere that Pythagoras, instead of the art of diviningby sacrifices, taught that kind of prediction which is by numbers, conceivingthat to be more sacred and divine, and more agreeable to the celestial nature ofthe gods.This hint some have taken to impose upon the world, under the name ofPythagoras, an Onomantic kind of arithmetic—assigning particular numbers to theletters of the alphabet, to the planets, to the days of the week, and to thesigns of the Zodiac. They thereby resolve questions concerning nativities,victory, life or death, journeys, prosperity or adversity. Such a system is setdown by Fludd,583 [endnote.xhtml#ftn583] who adds that Apollonius has deliveredanother way of divination according to the Pythagorean doctrine; affirming thatfuture things may be prognosticated by virtue of a wheel invented by Pythagoras.Hereby is treated of life and death, of fugitives, of litigious business, ofvictories, of the sex of children unborn, and infinite others of the like kind.But concerning the exposition of the wheel, and the true position of numbers,therein the ancient authors have written very inconstantly. So that the truth ofits composition cannot be comprehended otherwise than by conjecture. Whatancient authors he means I know not. The citation of Apollonius I doubt to be noless an assumption than the wheel itself, which Trithemius and othersacknowledge to be an invention of later times.584 [endnote.xhtml#ftn584]"},{"pageContent":"MUSICThe Pythagoreans define music as an apt composition of contraries, a union ofmany, and consent of differents.585 [endnote.xhtml#ftn585] For it not onlycoordinates rhythms and modulation, but all manner of systems. Its end is tounite, and aptly conjoin. God is the reconciler of things discordant, and hischief work—according to music and medicine—is to reconcile enmities. In musicconsists the agreement of all things, and the aristocracy of the universe. Forwhat is harmony in the world, in a city is good government, in a familytemperance.Of many sects (says Ptolemy) that were conversant about harmony, the mosteminent were two: the Pythagorean and Aristoxenian.586 [endnote.xhtml#ftn586]Pythagoras judged it by reason, Aristoxenus by sense.587 [endnote.xhtml#ftn587]The Pythagoreans, not crediting the relation of hearing in all those thingswherein it is requisite, adapted reasons to the differences of sounds, contraryto those which are perceived by the senses. So that by this criterion (reason),they gave occasion of calumny to such as were of a different opinion.588[endnote.xhtml#ftn588]Hence the Pythagoreans named that which we now call Harmonic, “Canonic”; notfrom the canon or instrument, as some imagine, but from rectitude—since reasonfinds out that which is right by using harmonic canons or rules.589[endnote.xhtml#ftn589] Even of all sorts of instruments framed by harmonic rules(pipes, flutes, and the like), they call the exercise canonic; which, althoughit be not canonic, yet is so termed because it is made according to the reasonsand theorems of canonic. The instrument therefore seems to be so denominatedfrom its canonic affection.A follower of canonic doctrine is a “harmonic” who is conversant byratiocination about that which consists of harmony. Musicians and harmonicsdiffer. Musicians are those harmonics who begin from sense; but canonics arePythagoreans, who are also called harmonics. Both sorts are termed by thegeneral name, Musicians."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1VOICE, ITS KINDSOf human voice, those of the Pythagorean school said that there are (as of onegenus) two species. One they properly named Continuous, the other Diastematic(intermissive), framing appellations from the accidents pertaining to each. Thediastematic they conceived to be that which is sung and rests upon every note,and manifests the mutation which is in all its parts. It is free from confusionand divided and disjoined by the magnitudes which are in the several sounds, asaccumulated but not mixed up. The parts of the voice, being applied mutually toone another, may easily be separated and distinguished, and are not destroyedtogether. Such is the musical kind of voice, which to the knowing, manifests allsounds of what magnitude everyone participates. For if a man use it not afterthis manner, he is not said to sing, but to speak. 590 [endnote.xhtml#ftn590]The other kind they conceived to be continuous, by which we discourse one toanother, and read. We are not constrained to use any manifest distinct tensionsof sounds, but to connect the discourse till we have finished that which weintended to speak. For if any man, in disputing or apologizing or reading, makesdistinct magnitudes in the several sounds, taking off and transferring the voicefrom one to another, he is not said to read but to sing.Human voice, having in this manner two parts, they conceived that there are twoplaces which each in passing possesses. The place of continuous voice—which isby nature infinite in magnitude—receives its proper term from that wherewith thespeaker began until he ends; that is the place from the beginning of his speechto his conclusive silence; so that the variety thereof is in our power. But theplace of diastematic voice is not in our power, but natural. And this likewiseis bounded by different effects. The beginning is that which is first heard, theend that which is last pronounced. For from thence we begin to perceive themagnitude of sounds, and their mutual commutations, from whence first ourhearing seems to operate.Whereas it is possible there may be some more obscure sounds perfected in naturewhich we cannot perceive or hear. As for instance, in things weighed there aresome bodies which seem to have no weight, such as straws, bran, and the like.But when, as by the adding together of such bodies some beginning of ponderosityappears, then we say they first come within the compass of static. So, when alow sound increases by degrees, that which first of all may be perceived by theear we make the beginning of the place which musical voice requires."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2FIRST MUSIC IN THE PLANETSThe names of sounds, in all probability, were derived from the seven stars,which move circularly in the heavens and compass the earth.591[endnote.xhtml#ftn591] (The circular motion of these bodies must of necessitycause a sound, for air being struck from the intervention of the blow sendsforth a noise. Nature herself constraining that the violent collision of twobodies should end in sound.592 [endnote.xhtml#ftn592])Now (say the Pythagoreans) all bodies which are carried round with noise—oneyielding and gently receding to the other—must necessarily cause soundsdifferent from each other, in the magnitude and swiftness of voice and in place.These, according to the reason of their proper sounds, or their swiftness, orthe orbs of repressions, in which the impetuous transportation of each isperformed—are either more fluctuating, or on the contrary, more reluctant. Butthese three differences of magnitude, celerity, and local distance, aremanifestly existent in the planets. These planets are constantly with soundcircling around through the aetherial diffusion, whence every one is calledimages [images/174.png] [star], as void of images [images/174_1.png] station;and images [images/174_3.png] , always in course; whence God and Aether arecalled images [images/174_2.png] and images [images/174_4.png] .593[endnote.xhtml#ftn593]Moreover the sound which is made by striking the air induces into the earsomething sweet and musical, or harsh and discordant. For if a certainobservation of numbers moderates the blow, it effects a harmony consonant toitself; but if it be haphazard and not governed by measures, there proceeds atroubled unpleasant noise which offends the ear.594 [endnote.xhtml#ftn594] Nowin heaven nothing is produced casually or randomly; but all things there proceedaccording to divine rules and settled proportions. Whence it may be irrefutablyinferred that the sounds which proceed from the conversion of the CelestialSpheres are musical. For sound necessarily proceeds from motion—and theproportion, which is in all divine things causes the harmony of this sound. ThisPythagoras, first of all the Greeks, conceived in his mind. He understood thatthe Spheres sounded something concordant because of the necessity of proportionwhich never forsakes celestial beings.From the motion of Saturn, which is the highest and furthest from us, thegravest sound in the diapason concord is called Hypate, because images[images/d3.png] signifys highest. From the Lunary, which is the lowest andnearest the earth, neate, for images [images/d4.png] signifys lowest.595[endnote.xhtml#ftn595] From those which are next these, viz. from the motion ofJupiter who is under Saturn, parypate; and of Venus, who is above the Moon,paraneate. Again, from the middle, which is the Sun's motion, the fourth fromeach part, mese, which is distant by a diatessaron in the Heptachord from bothextremes according to the ancient way; as the Sun is the fourth from eachextreme of the seven planets, being in the middle. Again, from those which arenearest the Sun on each side: from Mars who is placed between Jupiter and theSun, hypermese, which is likewise termed lichanus; and from Mercury who isplaced between Venus and the Sun, paramese.Pythagoras, by Musical proportion, calls that a Tone by how much the Moon isdistant from the Earth; from the Moon to Mercury the half of that space; andfrom Mercury to Venus almost as much. From Venus to the Sun sesqidulple; fromthe Sun to Mars a tone (that is as far as the Moon is from the Earth); from Marsto Jupiter half; and from Jupiter to Saturn half; and thence to the Zodiacsesquiduple. Thus there are made seven tones: which they call a Diapasonharmony, that is an universal concord, in which Saturn moves in the Doric mood,Jupiter in the Phrygian, and in the rest the like.596 [endnote.xhtml#ftn596]The sounds made by the seven planets and the Sphere of Fixed Stars, and thatwhich is above us (termed by them Antichthon), Pythagoras affirmed to be theNine Muses. But the composition and symphony, and, as it were, connection ofthem all—whereof as being eternal and unbegotten, each is a part and portion—henamed Mnemosyne."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE OCTOCHORDNow Pythagoras, first of all, left the middle sound by conjunction, being itselfcompared to the two extremes, should render only a diatessaron harmony, both tothe neate and to the hypate. But that we might have greater variety, the twoextremes making the fullest concord each to other, that is to say the concord ofdiapason, which consists in a double proportion.597 [endnote.xhtml#ftn597]Inasmuch as it could not be done by two Tetrachords, he added an eighth sound,inserting it between the mese and paramese—setting it from the mese a wholetone, and from the paramese a semitone. So that which was formerly the paramesein the Heptachord is still the third from the neate, both in name and place. Butthat which was now inserted is the fourth from the neate, and has a harmony untoit of diatessaron—which before, the mese had unto the hypate.598[endnote.xhtml#ftn598]But the tone between them, that is the mese, and the inserted called theparamese, instead of the former, to whichever Tetrachord it be added, whether tothat which is at the hypate, being of the lower; or to that of the neate, beingof the higher; will render diapente concord. This is either way a systemconsisting both of the Tetrachord itself, and the additional tone; as thediapente-proportion (viz. sesquialtera) is found to be a system of sesquitertia,and sesquioctava; the Tone therefore is sesquioctava.599 [endnote.xhtml#ftn599]Thus the interval of four chords, and of five, and of both conjoined together,called diapason, and the tone inserted between the two Tetrachords, being afterthis manner apprehended by Pythagoras, were determined to have this proportionin numbers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE ARITHMETICAL PROPORTIONS OF HARMONYPythagoras is said to have first found out the proportion and concord of soundsone to another: the Diatessaron in sesquitertia, the Diapente in sesquialtera,the Diapason in duple.600 [endnote.xhtml#ftn600] The occasion and manner isrelated by Censorinus,601 [endnote.xhtml#ftn601] Boethius,602[endnote.xhtml#ftn602] Macrobius,603 [endnote.xhtml#ftn603] and others; but moreexactly by Nicomachus604 [endnote.xhtml#ftn604] thus:Being in an intense thought, whether he might invent any instrumental help forthe ear, solid and infallible—such as the sight has by a compass, and a rule,and by a diopter; or the touch by a balance, or by the invention of measures—ashe passed by a smith's shop, by a happy chance he heard the iron hammersstriking upon the anvil, and rendering sounds most consonant one to another inall combinations except one. He observed in them these three concords: thediapason, the diapente, and the diatessaron. But that which was between thediatessaron and the diapente, he found to be a discord in itself, thoughotherwise useful for the making up of the greater of them (the diapente).Apprehending this to come to him from God as a most happy thing, he hastenedinto the shop. By various trials he found the difference of the sounds to beaccording to the weight of the hammers—and not according to the force of thosewho struck, nor according to the fashion of the hammers, nor according to theturning of the iron which was in beating out. Having taken exactly the weight ofthe hammers,605 [endnote.xhtml#ftn605] he went straightaway home. He tied fourstrings of the same substance, length, swiftness, and twist 606[endnote.xhtml#ftn606] to a beam on one side of the room, and then extended andfastened the other end of the strings to the wall on the other side of the room(lest any difference might arise from thence, or might be suspected to arisefrom the properties of several beams). Upon each of them he hung a differentweight, fastening it at the lower end, and making the length of the stringsaltogether equal. Then striking the strings by two at a time interchangeably, hefound out the aforesaid concords, each in its own combination.For that which was stretched by the greatest weight, in respect of that whichwas stretched by the least weight, he found to sound a diapason. The greatestweight was of twelve pounds, the least of six. Thence he determined that thediapason did consist in double proportion, which the weights themselves didshow. Next he found that the greatest to the least but one, which was of eightpounds, sounded a diapente. Whence he inferred this to consist in the proportioncalled sesquialtera, in which proportion the weights were one to another. Butunto that which was less than itself in weight, yet greater than the rest, beingof nine pounds, he found it to sound a diatessaron. He discovered thatproportionably to the weights, this concord was sesquitertia, which string tonine pounds is naturally sesquialtera to the least. For nine to six is so (viz.sesquialtera) as the least but one, which is eight, was to that which had theweight six, in proportion sesquitertia. And twelve to eight is sesquialtera. Andthat which is in the middle between diapente and diatessaron, whereby diapenteexceeds diatessaron, is confirmed to be in sesquioctava proportion, in whichnine is to eight. The system of both was called Diapente, that is, both of thediapente and diatessaron joined together, as duple proportion is compounded ofsesquialtera and sesquitertia, such as are two, eight, six. Or on the contrary,of diatessaron and diapente, as duple proportion is compounded of sesquitertiaand sesquialtera, as twelve, nine, six being taken in that order.Applying both his hand and ear to the weights which he had hung—and by themconfirming the proportion of the relations—he did ingeniously transfer thecommon result of the strings upon the cross-beam, to the bridge of anInstrument, which he called images [images/d1.png]images [images/d2.png][“Stretched with strings”]. And as for stretching them proportionably to theweights, he did transfer that to an answerable screwing of the pegs. Making useof this foundation as an infallible rule, he extended the experiment to manykinds of instruments: cymbals, pipes, flutes, monochords, triangles, and thelike. And he found, that this conclusion made by numbers was consonant withoutvariation in all.That sound which proceeded from the number six, he named hypate; that which fromthe number eight, mese, being sesquitertia to the other; that from nine,paramese, being a tone sharper than the mese, viz. sesquioctave; that fromtwelve, neate. And supplying the middle spaces according to the diatonic kind,with proportional sounds, he so ordered the Octochord with convenient numbers:duple, sesquialtera, sesquitertia, and (the difference of these two last)sesquioctava.images [images/179.png]Arithmetical proportions of harmonyFrom Thomas Stanley, The History of PhilosophyThus he found the progress by a natural necessity from the lowest to the highestaccording to the diatonical kind; from which again he did declare the Chromaticand Enharmonic kinds."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE DIVISION OF THE DIAPASON, ACCORDING TO THE DIATONIC KINDThis Diatonic kind seems naturally to have these degrees and progresses:hemitone, tone and tone (half-note, whole note, and whole note). This is thesystem Diatessaron, consisting of two tones, and that which is called ahemitone. Then another tone being inserted, Diapente is made, being a system ofthree tones and a hemitone. Then, in order after this, there being anotherdiatessaron, that is to say, another sesquitertia. So that in the more ancientHeptachord, all fourths from the lowest sound a diatessaron one to another: thehemitone taking the first, second, and third place, according to the progressionin the Tetrachord. The Pythagorean Octochord is a conjunction of a system of theTetrachord and the Pentachord, and that either jointly of two Tetrachords, ordisjointly of two Tetrachords, separated from one another by a tone. Here, theprocession will begin from the lowest. So that every fifth sound will make adiapente, the hemitone passing into four places, the first, the second, thethird, and the fourth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE CANON OF THE MONOCHORDPythagoras, as Timaeus says, discovered the Canon of one Chord—that is the ruleof the Monochord.607 [endnote.xhtml#ftn607] Aristides relates that a littlebefore he died, he exhorted his friends to play on the Monochord; therebyimplying that the height which is in Music is to be received rather by theIntellect through numbers, than by the sense through the ears.608[endnote.xhtml#ftn608]Duris (cited by Porphyry) mentions a brazen tablet set up in the temple of Junoby Arimnestus, son of Pythagoras, on which were graven, besides other arts, aMusical canon. This was afterwards taken away by Simon, a musician, whoarrogated the canon to himself and published it as his own.609[endnote.xhtml#ftn609]The division of the canon, says Theon, is made by the Tetractys in the Decad,which consists of a Monad, a Duad, a Triad, and a Tetrad—one, two, three,four.610 [endnote.xhtml#ftn610] For it comprehends a sesquitertia, asesquialtera, a duple, a triple, and a quadruple proportion.

By these, the cures ofmanners and passions were made, and the harmonies of the faculties of theirsouls were reduced to their primitive dispositions, and cures of distempers,both of body and mind, were invented by him.615 [endnote.xhtml#ftn615]And that music which was most worthy to be taken notice of, he reserved for hisdisciples—those which were called images [images/182.png] [“preparations”] andimages [images/182_1.png] [“contact, touch”],† both by weight and by sound—hecomposed them harmonically in a strange way. He made commixtures of those toneswhich are called Diatonic, Chromatic, and Enharmonic. By means of these, hechanged all the passions of the mind which were newly raised in them withoutreason—and which did procure griefs, angers, pities, unseemly loves, fears, allkind of desires, vexations, appetites, softnesses, idlenesses, andimpetuosities—correcting and directing every one of these towards virtue, byconvenient harmonies, as by certain effectual medicines.And at night when his disciples went to sleep, he delivered them from all thenoises and troubles of the day, and purified the perturbations of their minds,and rendered their sleeps quiet with good dreams and predictions. And when theyrose again from their beds, he freed them from the drowsiness of the night, fromfaintness and sluggishness, by certain proper songs, either set to the Lute orsome high voice.As for himself, he never played on an instrument or anything. But he had itwithin him; and by an inconceivable kind of divinity, he applied his ears andmind unto the harmony of the world, which he alone did understand. And heunderstood the universal harmony and consent of the spheres, and those starsthat move in them, which make a more full and excellent music than mortals. Thisthey do by reason of their motion, and of unequal and differing swiftnesses andbignesses, overtaking one another, all of which are ordered and disposed in amost musical proportion one towards another. Being beautified with variousperfections wherewith he was endowed, as having likewise the command of anorderly mind, as we may say, exercising it—he framed some representations ofthese sounds to exhibit them as much as was possible, imitating (that music)chiefly by instruments or the voice alone.For he conceived that to himself only, of all upon the earth, were intelligibleand audible the universal sounds from the natural fountain and root. And hethought himself worthy to be taught and to learn, and to be assimilated bydesire and imitation to the celestials, as one that was organized in the partsof the body by the deity which begot him. But it was sufficient for other menthat they, always looking upon him, and such things as they received from him,be benefited by images and examples; since they were not able to lay hold on thefirst clear archetypes of all things. As to them who cannot look upon the Sun byreason of its splendor, we show the eclipse either in a pond of water, or bysome bored pitched thing, or by some dark-colored glass, searing the weakness oftheir eyes, and framing another way of perception instead of looking on it, tothose who love such things, though something inferior.This, Empedocles seems to imply, concerning the extraordinary and divineconstitution of Pythagoras above others, when he said:Amongst these was one in things sublimest, skilledHis mind with all the wealth of learning filled.He sought whatever Sages did invent;And while his thoughts were on this work intent,All things that are, he easily surveyed,And search through ten or twenty ages made.Intimating by sublimest things, he surveyed all things that are. And the wealthof the mind and the like, the exquisite and accurate constitution of Pythagoraswas beyond others, both for body and mind, in seeing, hearing, andunderstanding."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8MEDICINE BY MUSICPythagoras conceived that music contributed much to health if used properly; forhe was accustomed to make use of this purification, not perfunctorily.616[endnote.xhtml#ftn616] This he called medicine by music, which kind of melody heexercised about the springtime. He seated him who played on the lute in themidst, and those who could sing sat round about him; and so he playing, theymade a consort of some excellent pleasant verses, wherewith they seemedexhilarated and decently composed.They likewise at another time made use of music as of a medicine; and there werecertain pleasant verses framed tending much against the affections and diseasesof the mind, and against the dejections and corrodings of the same. Moreover, hecomposed other music against anger and malice, and all such disorders of themind. There was also another kind of music and song invented, against unlawfuldesires. He likewise used dancing. He used no musical instrument but the lute.Wind-instruments he conceived to have an ignoble sound, and to be only fit forthe common people, but nothing generous.He likewise made use of the words of Homer and Hesiod for the rectifications ofthe mind. It is reported that Pythagoras, by a spondaic verse out of theworks617 [endnote.xhtml#ftn617] (perhaps of Hesiod, whose poem bears that title,images [images/184.png] [“work”]†), by a player on the flute, assuaged themadness of a young man of Tauromenium. He, being drunk, and having employed allthe night lasciviously with his mistress, was going about to burn the door ofhis rival's house; for he was exasperated and enflamed by the Phrygian mood. ButPythagoras, who was at that time busied in observing the stars, immediatelyappeased and reclaimed him by persuading the piper to change his air into thespondaic mood. Whereupon the young man being suddenly composed went quietlyhome—who but a little before would by no means hear the least exhortation fromPythagoras, but threatened and reviled him. In like manner Empedocles, when ayoung man, drew his sword upon Anchitus his host (for that he had in publicjudgment condemned his father to death). Empedocles was about to have killedhim, when Pythagoras straightway changing his tune, sung out of Homer:Nepenthe calming anger, easing grief.And by that means freed Anchitus his host from death, and the young man from thecrime of murder; who from thence forward became one of his disciples, eminentamongst them.Moreover the whole school of Pythagoras made that which is called images[images/185.png] [“preparedness”], and images [images/185_1.png] [“musicalcombination”], and images [images/185_2.png] [“contact”],† by certain versessuitable thereto and proper against the contrary affections, profitablydiverting the constitutions and dispositions of the mind. For when they went tobed and resigned themselves to rest, they purified their minds from the troublesand busy noises of the day by some songs and proper verses, whereby theyrendered their sleeps pleasant and quiet, and little troubled with dreams. Andthose dreams which they had were good. In the morning, when they arose from thecommon relief of sleep, they expelled drowsiness and sleepiness of the head withother songs.Sometimes also without pronouncing verses, they expelled some affections anddiseases and brought the sick to health, images [images/185_3.png] by charmingthem.† And from hence it is probable that the word “Epode” [an incantation] cameto be used. After this manner, Pythagoras instituted a most profitablecorrection of manners and life by music. Hitherto Iamblichus.All of which is ratified by other testimonies. That they had verses against theaffections of the mind—grief, anger, lust—is related also by Seneca, who saysthat Pythagoras composed the troubles of his soul by the lute.618[endnote.xhtml#ftn618] And Cicero, that the Pythagoreans used to deliver versesand some precepts, and to reduce the mind from intensity of thoughts totranquility by songs and instruments.619 [endnote.xhtml#ftn619] To which effectAelian relates to Clinias the Pythagorean, that if at any time he perceivedhimself inclining to anger, before it took full possession of him, he playedupon the lute; and to those who asked him why he did so, he answered, “Because Iam calmed.”620 [endnote.xhtml#ftn620]That Pythagoras danced, Porphyry confirms, saying he danced some dances, whichhe conceived to confer agility and health to the body.621 [endnote.xhtml#ftn621]That he disallowed flutes and wind-instruments appears in AristidesQuintilianus, who says he advised his disciples to refrain from permitting theirears to be defiled with the sound of the flute; but on the contrary, to purifythe irrational impulsions of the soul by solemn songs on the lute.622[endnote.xhtml#ftn622]That he made use of Homer and Hesiod for rectification of the mind is thusrelated by Porphyry.623 [endnote.xhtml#ftn623] He had morning exercises at hisown house, composing his soul to the lute, and singing some old paeans ofThales.624 [endnote.xhtml#ftn624] He likewise sung some verses of Homer andHesiod whereby the mind seemed to be rendered more sedate.The story of the young man is confirmed by Ammonius.625 [endnote.xhtml#ftn625]By Cicero, this is related: Whenas some young men being drunk, and irritated bythe music of flutes, would have broken open the door of a modest matron's house,Pythagoras had the woman-piper play a spondaic tune; which as soon as she did,their raging petulancy was allayed by the slowness of the mood, and solemness ofthe tune.626 [endnote.xhtml#ftn626] St. Basil relates another story to the samepurpose: that Pythagoras meeting with some that came from a feast drunk, bid thepiper (the musician at that feast) to change his tune, and to play a Doric air;wherewith they were so brought to themselves that they threw away theirgarlands, and went home ashamed.627 [endnote.xhtml#ftn627]That evening and morning his disciples used music to compose their minds isaffirmed by many others. Quintilian wrote, “It was the custom of thePythagoreans as soon as they waked, to excite their souls with the lute, thatthey might be the readier for action; and before they went to sleep, to softentheir minds by it.”628 [endnote.xhtml#ftn628] Plutarch says, “The music of thelute the Pythagoreans used before they went to sleep, thereby charming andcomposing the passionate and irrational part of the soul.”629[endnote.xhtml#ftn629] Censorinus wrote that Pythagoras, so that his mind mightbe continually seasoned with divinity, used (as they say) to sing before he wentto sleep and as soon as he waked.630 [endnote.xhtml#ftn630]As for the several moods which in musical compositions were observed by theAncients for moving particular passions, there is a remarkable fragment of Damonthe musician cited by Aristides.631 [endnote.xhtml#ftn631]"},{"pageContent":"GEOMETRYPythagoras (says Iamblichus) is reported to have been much addicted to Geometry,for amongst the Egyptians, of whom he learned it, there are many geometricalproblems.632 [endnote.xhtml#ftn632] The most learned Egyptians were continually,for many ages of gods and men, required to measure their whole country by reasonof the overflowing and decrease of the Nile—whence it is called Geometry.633[endnote.xhtml#ftn633]Some there are who ascribe all theorems concerning Lines jointly to theEgyptians and the Chaldeans; and all these, they say, Pythagoras took, andaugmenting the science, explained them accurately to his disciples. Proclusaffirms that Pythagoras first advanced the geometrical part of learning into aliberal science, considering the principles more sublimely (than Thales,Ameristus, and Hippias, his predecessors in this study) and thoroughlyinvestigated the theorems immaterially and intellectually.634[endnote.xhtml#ftn634] Timaeus says that he first perfected geometry, theelements whereof (as Anticlides affirms), were invented by Moeris.635[endnote.xhtml#ftn635] Aristoxenus says that Pythagoras first introducedmeasures and weights amongst the Grecians.636 [endnote.xhtml#ftn636]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1OF A POINT, LINE, SUPERFICIES AND SOLIDPythagoras asserted a Point to be correspondent in proportion to a unit; a Lineto two; a Superficies to three: a Solid to four. 637 [endnote.xhtml#ftn637]The Pythagoreans define a Point as a Monad having Position.638[endnote.xhtml#ftn638]A Line, being the second, and constituted by the First Motion from indivisiblenature, they called Duad.639 [endnote.xhtml#ftn639]A Superficies they compared to the number three, for that is the first of allcauses which are found in figures: for a circle, which is the principle of allround figures, occultly comprises a triad in center, space, andcircumference.640 [endnote.xhtml#ftn640] But a triangle, which is the first ofall rectilinear figures, is manifestly included in a ternary, and receives itsform according to that number.Hence the Pythagoreans affirm, that the triangle is simply the Principle ofGeneration, and of the formation of things generable. Whereupon Timaeus saysthat all proportions, natural as well as of the constitution of elements, aretriangular; because they are distant by a threefold interval and are collectiveof things every way divisible. Triangles are variously permutable and arereplenished with material infinity, and represent the natural conjunctions ofbodies dissolved. As triangles are comprehended by three right lines, they alsohave angles which collect the multitude of lines, and give the additionalproperty of an angle and conjunction to them.641 [endnote.xhtml#ftn641]With reason therefore did Philolaus dedicate the angle of a triangle to fourgods: Saturn, Pluto, Mars, and Bacchus—comprehending in these the wholequadripartite ornament of elements coming down from heaven or from the fourquarters of the Zodiac. For Saturn constitutes an essence wholly humid andfrigid; Mars wholly fiery; Pluto comprises all terrestrial life; Bacchuspredominates over humid and hot generation, of which wine is a sign being humidand hot. All these differ in their operations upon second bodies, but are unitedto one another, for which reason Philolaus collected their union according toone angle.images [images/189_1.png]images [images/189_2.png]images [images/189_3.png]images [images/189_4.png]But if the differences of triangles conduce to generation, we must justlyacknowledge the triangle to be the principle and author of the constitution ofsublunary things. For the right angle gives them essence, and determines themeasure of its being; and the proportion of a rectangle triangle causes theessence of generable elements; the obtuse angle gives them all distance, theproportion of an obtuse-angled triangle augments material forms in magnitude,and in all kinds of mutation; the acute angle makes their nature divisible, theproportion of an acute-angled triangle prepares them to receive divisions intoinfinite; and, simply, the triangular proportion constitutes the essence ofmaterial bodies, distant and every way divisible. Thus much for triangles.Of quadrangular figures, the Pythagoreans hold that the square chieflyrepresents the Divine Essence, for by it they principally signify pure andimmaculate order; for rectitude imitates inflexibility, equality firm power; formotion proceedeth from inequality, rest from equality.642 [endnote.xhtml#ftn642]The gods therefore—who are authors in all things of firm consistence, pureincontaminate order, and inevitable power—are not improperly represented by thefigure of a square.Moreover Philolaus, by another apprehension, calls the angle of a square theangle of a Rhea, Ceres, and Vesta. Seeing that the Square constitutes the Earthand is the nearest element to it (as Timaeus teaches), but that the Earth itselfreceives genital seeds and prolific power from all these gods, he not unaptlycompares the angle of a square to all these life-communicating deities. For somecall the Earth and Ceres herself, Vesta; and Rhea is said wholly to participateof her, and that in her is all generative causes. Whence Philolaus says theangle of a square, by a certain terrestrial power, comprehends one union ofthese divine kinds.images [images/190_1.png]The Greek understanding of geometry can be observed in many surviving remants ofthe ancient world, including coinage.

Therefore six equilateral trianglesjoined at the angles, complete four right angles, as do also three hexagons andfour squares. But of all other polygons whatsoever, joined together at theangles, some exceed four right angles, others fall short. This Proclus calls aCelebrious Theorem of the Pythagoreans.Every triangle has the internal angles equal to two right angles.644[endnote.xhtml#ftn644] This theorem, Eudemus the Peripatetic ascribes to thePythagoreans. For their manner of demonstration see Proclus.In rectangle triangles, the square which is made of the side opposite the rightangle [the hypotenuse], is equal to the squares which are made of the sidescontaining the right angle.645 [endnote.xhtml#ftn645]This theorem Pythagoras found out; and by it he showed how to make a gnomon orsquare (which the carpenters cannot do without much difficulty and uncertainty),not mechanically, but according to rule. For if we take three rulers: one ofthem being three feet long, the second four feet, the third five feet, and putthese three so together that they touch one another at the ends in a triangle,they make a perfect square. Now if to each of these rulers be ascribed a square,that which consisted of three feet will have nine; that which of four will havesixteen; that which of five will have twenty-five. So that how many feet theareas of the two lesser squares of three and four make, so many will the squareof five make.646 [endnote.xhtml#ftn646]images [images/192_1.png]Illustration of the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2)Apollodorus the Logician,647 [endnote.xhtml#ftn647] and others relate that uponthe invention of this Theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed a Hecatomb to the Muses,648[endnote.xhtml#ftn648] in confirmation whereof they alleged this epigram,That noble Scheme Pythagoras devis'd,For which a Hecatomb he sacrific'd.Plutarch says, it was only one ox 649 [endnote.xhtml#ftn649] and even that isquestioned by Cicero as inconsistent with his doctrine, which forbade bloodysacrifices.650 [endnote.xhtml#ftn650] The more accurate therefore relate (saysPorphyry), that he sacrificed an ox made of flower; or, as Gregory Nazianzensays, of clay.651 [endnote.xhtml#ftn651]But Plutarch doubts whether it was for the invention of the forementionedproposition that Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or for the problem concerning thearea of a Parabola.652 [endnote.xhtml#ftn652] Indeed, the application of spacesor figures to lines is (as his follower Eudemus affirms), an invention of thePythagorean Muse: Parabola, Hyperbola, Ellipsis.653 [endnote.xhtml#ftn653] Fromthem, the later writers taking these names, transferred them to conical lines,calling one parabola, another hyperbola, another, ellipsis. Whereas thoseancient divine persons, the Pythagoreans, signified by those names thedescription of places applied to a determinate right line. For when a right linebeing proposed, the space given is wholly adequate to the right line, then, theysay the space is applied images [images/193_1.png]. But when you make the lengthof the space greater than that of the right line,654 [endnote.xhtml#ftn654] thenthey say it exceeds images [images/193_2.png].

He determinedthat it was proportionably as much longer than that of other men as the Olympiccourse he established was longer than all others. And having comprehended thesize of Hercules's foot, he considered what length of body did suit with thatmeasure, according to the natural proportion of all the members one to another.He concluded that Hercules was so much taller in body than others, by how muchthe Olympic course was longer than the rest which were made after the samenumber of feet."},{"pageContent":"ASTRONOMYN either did the Pythagoreans superficially consider the speculation ofcelestial things, in which Pythagoras was also exquisite, as appears by thesefew remains.656 [endnote.xhtml#ftn656]images [images/195_1.png]Although only a demi-god, Hercules (Heracles to the Greeks) was as familiar asany of the Olympian deities.

The first and outmost is the fixed Sphere;next to this is the star of Saturn; and then the other six planets, Jupiter,Mars, Venus, Mercury, Sun, and Moon; next these, the Sphere of Fire, then thatof Air, then of Water, last of all the Earth.658 [endnote.xhtml#ftn658]But they who seem more strictly to follow the mind of Pythagoras and hisdisciples, aver that they held the celestial Spheres to be ten—whereof nine onlyare visible to us (the fixed Sphere, the seven planets, and our Earth). Thetenth is Antichthon, an Earth above, or opposite to ours.659[endnote.xhtml#ftn659] This Antichthon they added to make up the number of themoving bodies.660 [endnote.xhtml#ftn660] For they considered that the affectionsand proportions of music consist in numbers; that all other things appear to beassimilated to numbers; that numbers are the first of all nature; and that theelements of numbers are the elements of all beings. They therefore asserted thatall Heaven is harmony and number, and that the affections and parts of Heavenare correspondent to number. And collecting these, they adapted them to thecomposition of the whole; wherein if anything were wanting they supplied it,that the whole might be alike compacted. Thusly, because the Decad seems to beperfect and to comprehend the whole nature of numbers, they asserted thecelestial spheres to be ten. Now there being nine only visible to us, hereuponthey conceived the tenth to be Antichthon, an Earth opposite to ours.As concerning the order and system of these, the Pythagoreans held, that in themiddle of the world is Fire.661 [endnote.xhtml#ftn661] Or, as Stobaeus says,662[endnote.xhtml#ftn662] in the midst of the four elements is the fiery globe ofunity which they term Vesta and Monad.663 [endnote.xhtml#ftn663] Simplicius saysthat they who understand this thing more intimately state that this fire is theprocreative, nutritive, and excitative power which is in the midst of the Earth.But Simplicius himself seems not to have apprehended the right meaning of thePythagoreans—who by this fire, or fiery globe of unity, meant nothing else butthe Sun seated in the midst of the universe, immoveable, about which the otherparts of the world are moved. This opinion Pythagoras seems to have derived fromthe Egyptians, who hieroglyphically represented the Sun by a beetle. They chosethis symbol because the beetle, having formed a ball of cow dung, and lying uponits back, rolls it about from claw to claw; so the other parts of the world aremoved and rolled by and about the Sun.664 [endnote.xhtml#ftn664]By this immovable fire in the midst of the Universe, they understood not (asSimplicius conceives) that the Earth is manifest. Forasmuch as they further heldthat the Earth is not immovable,665 [endnote.xhtml#ftn665] nor seated in themidst of the globe, but suspended, as being one of the stars carried about thefire which is in the middle; and that thereby it makes day and night.666[endnote.xhtml#ftn666] The reason why the Earth ought not to have the middleplace is because the most excellent body ought to have the most excellent place.Fire is more excellent than Earth, and the center more excellent than all placeswithout it; therefore they conceived that not the Earth, but the Fire is placedin the midst.667 [endnote.xhtml#ftn667] Moreover, because that which is the mostexcellent of the universe, ought principally to be preserved, and the middle issuch, therefore they term the Fire images [images/197_1.png],† the custody ofJupiter.The same they held of the Antichthon also, that like our Earth it is suspended,as being one of the stars carried about the Fire, and thereby makes day andnight.668 [endnote.xhtml#ftn668] By this Antichthon, Clemens says theyunderstood Heaven. Simplicius says the Moon, as being a kind of aetherialEarth—as well for that it eclipses the light of the Sun which is proper to theEarth, as for that it is the bound of celestials, as the Earth of sublunaries.But the contrary is manifest, as well from the completing of the number ten (inrespect whereof this Antichthon was imagined). For they held it is not visibleto us by reason that following the motion of this Earth, it is always oppositeto, or beneath us, and the bigness of our Earth hinders us from seeing it.669[endnote.xhtml#ftn669] And Aristotle affirms there were some who conceived theAntichthon to be the cause why there are more eclipses of the Moon than of theSun, which may likewise happen by reason of many other bodies invisible to us.Laertius, who, says Philosaus, was the first who conceived the Earth to have acircular motion, seems to mean no more than that he first committed this opinionof Pythagoras to writing and first made it public.670 [endnote.xhtml#ftn670] ForEusebius expressly affirms that he committed to writing the dissertations ofPythagoras. His opinion, as delivered by Plutarch and Stobaeus, is exactly thesame: for he placed fire in the midst, which he called the genius of theuniverse, and the mansion of Jupiter, and the mother of gods, and altar, andward, and measure of nature. He conceived that the ten celestial bodies moveabout it—Heaven, the Sphere of Fixed Stars, the five planets, the Sun, the Moon,the Earth, and lastly the Antichthon.From the same fountain seems Aristarchus the Samian to have derived thishypothesis, though some ascribe the invention thereof to him. For he supposedthat the Sun and planets move not, but that the Earth moves round about the Sunwhich is seated in the middle.671 [endnote.xhtml#ftn671] Plutarch adds thatPlato in his old age repented for that he had placed the Earth in the midst ofthe universe, and not in its proper place.672 [endnote.xhtml#ftn672]This opinion was of late revived by Nicolaus Copernicus, who considering howinconvenient and troublesome it is to understand and maintain the motions of theHeavens and immobility of the Earth, explained it with admirable ingenuity afterthe mind of the Pythagoreans. According to whose hypothesis, the Sun, as wesaid, is settled in the midst of the world, immovable. The Sphere of Fixed Starsin the extremity or outside of the world is immovable also. Between these aredisposed the planets, and amongst them the Earth as one of them. The Earth movesboth about the Sun, and about his proper axis. Its diurnal motion by onerevolution, makes a night and a day; its annual motion about the Sun, by onerevolution makes a year. So as by reason of its diurnal motion to the east, theSun and other stars seem to move to the west; and by reason of its annual motionthrough the Zodiac, the Earth itself is in one sign, and the Sun seems to be inthe sign opposite to it. Between the Sun and the Earth they place Mercury andVenus. Between the Earth and the Fixed Stars are Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. TheMoon, being next the Earth, is continually moved within the great orb betweenVenus and Mars, round about the Earth as its center. Its revolution about theEarth is completed in a month; about the Sun (together with the Earth) in ayear."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETSAs concerning the course and revolution of the planets, they affirm the greatyear to be the revolution of Saturn. For the rest of the planets complete theirperiods in a shorter time; but Saturn in no less then thirty years. Jupiter intwelve years; Mars in two; the Sun (speaking according to the phenomenon) inone; Mercury and Venus as the Sun (or to speak more exactly, Mercury in threemonths, Venus in eight); the Moon as being next the Earth, soonest, in amonth.673 [endnote.xhtml#ftn673]According to this inequality appears the motion of the planets to our sight, byreason that the eye is out of the center of the orb. But in the whole course ofAstronomy (says Geminus) are supposed the motions of the Sun, Moon, and fiveplanets, equal and circular; contrary to the diurnal revolution of the world.The Pythagoreans, first applying themselves to these disquisitions, supposedcircular and equal motions of the Sun, the Moon, and five planets. For theyadmitted not such irregularity in eternal and divine bodies, that sometimes theyshould move swifter, sometimes slower, and sometimes stand still (as thestationary points in the planets). Neither in any sober, well-tempered personcould we admit such irregularity of pace. Indeed, the necessities of life oftencause men to move faster or slower; but in the incorruptible nature of thestars, there cannot be alleged any cause to swiftness and slowness. Whereforethe Pythagoreans proposed this question, how the phenomena's might be salved bycircular and equal motions.That Pythagoras himself observed these irregularities and the ways to assuagethem, appears from Iamblichus, who says he communicated a revelative rightknowledge of all manner of motion of the spheres and stars, images[images/200_1.png]images [images/200_2.png] [“their oppositions, their eclipses,inequalities, eccentricities and epicycles”]. ‘images [images/200_3.png][“oppositions”] is the anticipation of any planet, either in respect to someother planet or to the Fixed Stars. ‘images [images/200_4.png] [“eclipses”] isthe falling later of any planet, either in respect to some other planet, or tothe Fixed Stars. ‘images [images/200_5.png], Inequality,† is when the sameplanet moves slower and faster according to its distance from the Sun in thePythagorean hypothesis (or from the Earth in the Ptolemaic), slower in itsaphelion, faster in its perihelion.The two ways of solving these phenomena are by eccentrics or by epicycles. For ahomocentric with an epicycle (as Eudoxus first demonstrated), is equipollent toan eccentric. Eccentricity is when the center of their equal motion is distantfrom the center of their apparent motion. Both these Iamblichus ascribes toPythagoras,674 [endnote.xhtml#ftn674] from whom perhaps they were communicatedto Eudoxus, to whose invention others ascribe them.675 [endnote.xhtml#ftn675]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE INTERVALS AND HARMONY OF THE SPHERESPythagoras (says Censorinus) asserted that this whole world is made according tomusical proportion; and that the seven planets between Heaven and the Earth,which govern the nativities of mortals, have a harmonious motion. And they haveIntervals correspondent to musical Diastemes, and render various soundsaccording to their several heights so consonant that they make most sweetmelody. But to us these sounds are inaudible by reason of the greatness of thenoise, which the narrow passage of our ears is not capable to receive.676[endnote.xhtml#ftn676]For as Eratosthenes determined that the largest circumference of the Earth is252,000 stadia; so Pythagoras declared how many stadia there are between theEarth and every star. In this measure of the world, we are to understand theItalic stadium, which consists of 625 feet. (For there are others of a differentlength, such as the Olympic of 600 feet, and the Pythic of 500.) From the Earththerefore to the Moon, Pythagoras conceived to be about 12,600 stadia. And thatdistance, according to musical proportion, is a tone. From the Moon to Mercury(who is called images [images/202_1.png] [“twinkling”]) half as much, as it werea hemitone. From thence to Phosphorus, which is the star Venus, almost as much,that is, another hemitone. From thence to the Sun, twice as much, as it were atone and a half. Thus the Sun is distant from the Earth three tones and a half,which is called diapente; from the Moon, two and a half, which is diatessaron.From the Sun to Mars, who is called images [images/203_2.png] [“Fire”], there isthe same interval as from Earth to the Moon, which makes a tone; from thence toJupiter, who is called images [images/203_1.png] [“radiant”], half as much,which makes a hemitone. From there to the Supreme Heaven where the signs are isa hemitone also. So that the diasteme from the Supreme Heaven to the Sun isdiatessaron, that is, two tones and a half: from the same Heaven to the top ofthe Earth six tones, a diapason concord. Moreover he referred to other starsmany things which the masters of music treat of, and showed that all this worldis Enharmonic. Thus Censorinus. But Pliny, delivering this opinion ofPythagoras, reckons seven tones from the Earth to the Supreme Heaven; forwhereas Censorinus accounts for a hemitone from Saturn to the Zodiac, Plinymakes it sesquiduple.677 [endnote.xhtml#ftn677]images [images/202_2.png]Intervals and harmony of the spheres From Thomas Stanley, The History ofPhilosophy (slightly modified)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4OF THE PLANET VENUSNext to the Sun (says Pliny), there is a great star called Venus, alternatelyerrant in names, emulating both the Sun and Moon.678 [endnote.xhtml#ftn678] Forpresenting and rising before morning, he takes the name of Lucifer, as anotherSun bringing on day. On the other side shining at Sunset, it is called Vesper,as suspending light and performing the office of the Moon. This is its nature,which Pythagoras the Samian first found out about the forty-second Olympiad [ca.608 B.C.], which was of Rome the 147th year. In magnitude, Venus exceeds all theother stars, and is of so great splendor that this star only casts a shadow.Whence it has a diversity of names: some call it Juno; others, Isis; others,Mother of the gods. By the nature hereof, all things are generated upon Earth.For at rising, it scatters prolific dew, supplying not only the conceptions ofEarth, but likewise stimulating all living creatures. It performs the revolutionof the Zodiac in 348 days, never receding from the Sun more than forty-sixparts, according to Timaeus. Thus Pliny.That there is a mistake in the time has been already shown; but the thing itselfis confirmed by Laertius, who affirms Pythagoras first said that Vesper andLucifer are the same star. Yet elsewhere Laertius adds that some ascribe this toParmenides. But that it was a doctrine of the Pythagoreans, appears from thisaccount given by Timaeus. The star Juno many call Venus and Lucifer. All personare not skillful in the rules of sacred Astronomy, and in the sciences of risingand setting. For the same star is sometimes Hesper when it follows the Sun insuch manner that it is conspicuous to us when the Sun is set; and sometimes Eouswhen it goes before the Sun and rises before Sun-rising."},{"pageContent":"Section II: PhilosophyPHILOSOPHY, ITS NAME, DEFINITION, PARTS, METHODThe Pythagoreans, being adorned with these studies of Science, from thenceascended to perfect the Works of the World and the Principles of Nature.679[endnote.xhtml#ftn679]Pythagoras first gave the name to Philosophy defining it as, “A longing and loveof wisdom.”680 [endnote.xhtml#ftn680] Wisdom is the science of truth in thingsthat are. Things that are, he called immaterials, eternals, and sole agents,which are the incoporeals; the rest are equivocally called such by participationwith these: viz. corporeals, materials, and corruptibles, which indeed are not.Now wisdom is the science of those things which are, but not of those which areequivocally. For corporeals are not capable of being taught, nor admit certainknowledge, being infinite and not comprehensible by science. And things which(as it were) are not—according to the difference of all things—neither can berightly described by any definition. Of those whose nature is such as that theycannot be known, it is impossible to frame a science. Wherefore neither is itlikely that there can be a love of a science which is not. But rather of thatwhich is conversant about those things which properly are, and continue alwaysthe same, and are like themselves, and co-exist always with a trueappellation—upon the knowledge of these follows that which is of equivocalthings (though not sought after), as the science of particulars follows thescience of universals. For as Archytas says, “They who know universals well,will plainly see what particulars are.”Wherefore things that are, are not of one kind only and simply, but of many andvarious kinds—intelligibles and incorporeals, whose appellation is images[images/205.png], “things that are.” Corporeal things, subject to sense, arethose which exist by participation of those that are. Concerning all these, hedelivered most proper sciences, leaving nothing unexcused; and delivered also tomen the common sciences—such as the demonstrative, the definitive, and thedivisive—as is manifest from the commentaries of the Pythagoreans.Hereupon he defined philosophy as the knowledge of things that are; and theknowledge of things divine and human; as also the meditation of death,681[endnote.xhtml#ftn681] daily endeavoring to free the soul from the prison of thebody; and the resemblance of God as far as is possible for man.682[endnote.xhtml#ftn682]For the scope of philosophy is to free the mind, the divine part of the soulwhich is planted in us, and to set it at liberty. Without which liberty none canlearn or perceive anything solid or true by the help or benefit of sense. Forthe mind, according to him, sees all things and hears all things. All thingselse are deaf and blind.683 [endnote.xhtml#ftn683]Thus it is that philosophy is of two kinds: practical and theoretical. Thepractical, according to the method of the Pythagoreans, precedes thetheoretical. The reason is thus explained by Hierocles.Philosophy is the purification and perfection of human life—purification frommaterial irrationality and the mortal body; perfection from the recovery of itsown excellent life, reducing it to the divine resemblance. Virtue and truth arechiefly able to effect these by taking away excess of passions. This (rightly)induces the divine form.684 [endnote.xhtml#ftn684]First are laid down the instructions of practical virtue: for to begin with, wemust compose the Irrationality which is in us, and then (so prepared) applyourselves to the knowledge of the more divine things. For as it is not possiblefor the eye, being full of dirt and not cleansed, to look upon things verybright, so neither can the soul, not possessing virtue, gaze upon the beauty ofTruth. For that which is not pure is not capable of touching that which is pure.Practical philosophy produces virtue; theoretical, truth. As in these GoldenVerses of Pythagoras we find the practical philosophy called human virtue, butthe theoretical celebrated as divine virtue when closing the instructions incivil virtue,These labor (says he) study these, and these affect;To divine Virtue, these thy steps direct.First therefore a man must be made good, then a god. The civil virtues render aman good, but the sciences conducing to the divine virtue divinize. But to thosewho ascend, the lesser things precede the greater. For which reason in thePythagorean precepts, the rules of virtue are first delivered, teaching us toascend from the greatest use of life to the divine resemblance.Three ways, say they, man may become better than himself. First by conversationwith the gods. For it is necessary that he who addresses himself to them, atthat time, sequester himself from all evil, assimilating himself as near as hecan to God. Secondly, by well doing, for that is proper to God, and therein heimitates God. Thirdly, by death. For if the soul in this life, being a littleseparated from the body, becomes better and begins to divine in dreams, byvisions, and the altered states of mind brought on by diseases, it will be muchbetter when it shall be wholly separated from the body.685[endnote.xhtml#ftn685]Hence he affirmed that the most considerable of all things human is to informthe soul concerning good and ill.686 [endnote.xhtml#ftn686] He taught that menhave perfect felicity687 [endnote.xhtml#ftn687] when they have a good soul;688[endnote.xhtml#ftn688] or that the knowledge of the perfection of the virtues ofthe soul is the chief felicity. Further, that every man is appointed by God toknow and to contemplate;689 [endnote.xhtml#ftn689] that virtue is a harmony, andso is all good, even God himself;690 [endnote.xhtml#ftn690] and that the end orchief good is to resemble God. Whence he expressly said, “Follow God, notvisible to the eye, but intelligible to the understanding, by the harmony of theWorld.” 691 [endnote.xhtml#ftn691] That the most excellent things given by thegods unto men are: to speak truth, and to benefit others [theoretical andpractical virtue], and that each of these resembled the works of God. 692[endnote.xhtml#ftn692] To the latter Strabo alludes when commending those whosaid men imitate the gods most when they benefit others.693[endnote.xhtml#ftn693] The former is confirmed by Porphyry when he advised aboveall things to speak truth, for that only is able to make men like to thegods.694 [endnote.xhtml#ftn694] For God himself in his body resembles light, inhis soul truth, as he learned of the Persian Magi who term God Ahura Mazda. Thisis that images [images/207.png] (divinity) which Iamblichus695[endnote.xhtml#ftn695] reckons last in his recapitulation of the same with whichthe Golden Verses conclude, thus:Then stripped of flesh up to free Aether soar,A deathless God, divine, mortal no more."},{"pageContent":"PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY: ITS PARTS; AND FIRST OF EDUCATIONPractical philosophy seems to have been the invention of Pythagoras, forAristotle affirms that he first undertook to discourse concerning virtue. ThatSocrates is generally esteemed the author thereof perhaps is only because, asAristotle adds, coming after Pythagoras he discoursed better and more fullythereupon.To this part of philosophy alluded this sentence of Pythagoras: That thediscourse of that Philosopher is vain by which no passion of a man is healed.For as there is no benefit of medicine if it expel not disease out of bodies, soneither is there of philosophy if it expel not ill out of the soul.696[endnote.xhtml#ftn696]Virtues being of two kinds—private, which respect ourselves, and public, whichhave reference to others—Pythagoras seems to have comprehended the first underEducation, the second under Politics. Laertius affirms he wrote three treatises:Education, Politics, Physic.697 [endnote.xhtml#ftn697] The heads of Education,according to the general recapitulation of Iamblichus, seem to have been these:Institution, Silence, Abstinence from Flesh, Fortitude, Temperance, Sagacity."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1INSTITUTION, SILENCE, ABSTINENCEConcerning Instruction or Institution, there are these sentences and precepts ofPythagoras, preserved by Stobaeus and others.We ought to make choice of the best course of life; for custom will make itpleasant.698 [endnote.xhtml#ftn698] Wealth is a weak anchor, glory a weaker: Thebody, magistracies, honors—all these are infirm and unable. What are then ableanchors—wisdom, magnanimity, fortitude. These no tempest shakes. This is the lawof God: that virtue only is solid; all else are but trifles.To take away bitterness from wormwood and liberty from speech are both alike.699[endnote.xhtml#ftn699]Endeavor not to conceal thy faults with words but to amend them by reproof.700[endnote.xhtml#ftn700]It is not so hard to offend as to not reprove an offending person.701[endnote.xhtml#ftn701]As the sickness of the body if hid or praised, is not healed, so the soulcherished in its ways or concealed is not reformed.702 [endnote.xhtml#ftn702]Rejoice more in reprovers than in flatterers: fly from flatterers as enemies.703[endnote.xhtml#ftn703]We ought either to be silent or to speak things that are better than silence.704[endnote.xhtml#ftn704]It is better to throw a stone at random than an idle word.705[endnote.xhtml#ftn705]Comprehend not few things in many words but many things in few words.706[endnote.xhtml#ftn706]We must faithfully restore to him that entrusts us the deposit, not only ofmoney, but of words.707 [endnote.xhtml#ftn707]Of opinion, the Pythagoreans said thus. Is the part of a man void ofunderstanding to adhere to all men's opinions, especially to that which ismaintained by the greatest number? For to conceive and judge aright is proper tofew; it only belongs to the knowing who are not many. This power thereforeextends not to many.708 [endnote.xhtml#ftn708] On the other side, it is no lessmadness to condemn all conception and opinion. Such a person must be unlearnedand unrectifiable. For it is necessary that he who is ignorant learn thosethings whereof he is ignorant; and that he who learns, addict and resign himselfto his teacher. In a word, they said it is necessary that such young men aswould be preserved, should addict themselves to the conceptions and opinions oftheir elders and such as lead a good life.Now in the whole course of human life, there are certain distinct ages which arenot recklessly to be connected—for they are expelled by one another, unless aman be well and rightly ordered from his birth. It is requisite, therefore, thatfrom the institution of a little child in goodness, temperance, and fortitude, agreat part be transmitted to his youth when he arrives at that age. Likewise ofhis youth instituted in goodness, fortitude and temperance, a great part betransmitted to his manly estate.Herein the course ordinarily taken is ridiculous. For most think that childrenought to be well-ordered, instructed in temperance, and to abstain from allthings odious and undecent. But when they come to be youths, most leave them totheir own management, to do what they please; whereas at that age, they aresubject to both sorts of vices—of children and of men. To shun study and order,and to follow play and wantonness, the vice of childhood, is likewise mostproper to youth again. Vehement desires, ambition, and the like, the affectionsof manhood, insinuate into youth. For which reason, this age requires care aboveall the rest. In fine, a man should never be so given over as to do whatsoeverhe pleases, but there should always be some overseer, a president over the rest,a legitimate sitting magistrate whom every citizen ought to obey. For a livingcreature, as soon as ever it is neglected, falls into ill and wickedness.They affirm, that they have often enquired and examined for what reason we givechildren food at set times and moderately. The ordinary answer is that order andmoderation are good; their contraries, disorder and immoderateness, ill—as ismanifest, inasmuch as to be a glutton or a drunkard is esteemed a greatreproach. For if none of these were useful and beneficial to us when we arriveat man's estate, it were needless to accustom ourselves, while children, to suchorder. It is the same in other habits. We see it manifest also in all otherkinds of living creatures, which are taught by man from the very beginning aswhelps and the like, those things which they are required to practice when theyare come to full growth.

Of silence, abstinence, and the wholecourse of his Institution, we have formerly treated."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2FORTITUDEThe greatest argument of the Pythagoreans for fortitude was that they fullypersuaded themselves that of all human chances, nothing ought to happenunexpectedly to any, but that they should expect all things which were notwithin their own power. Precepts of Pythagoras, tending to this virtue, arethese.709 [endnote.xhtml#ftn709]Do those things which you judge to be good, although after you have done themyou shall be not be esteemed; for the vulgar is an ill judge of all good things.As you despise their praise, so despise their dispraise.710[endnote.xhtml#ftn710]He forbade to forsake the protection and station of this life without thecommand of our Supreme Lord.711 [endnote.xhtml#ftn711]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3TEMPERANCE AND CONTINENCEHe often gave the following apothegms, or aphorisms, to all his auditors whethermany or few.We must avoid with our utmost endeavor, and amputate with fire and sword, and byall other means: from the body, sickness; from the soul, ignorance; from thebelly, luxury; from a city, sedition; from a family, discord; from all things,excess.712 [endnote.xhtml#ftn712]It is better to live lying on the ground with a settled conscience than to havea golden bed and be troubled.713 [endnote.xhtml#ftn713]Temperance is the strength of the soul; for it is the light of the soul, clearfrom Passion.714 [endnote.xhtml#ftn714]To serve passions is more grievous than to serve tyrants.715[endnote.xhtml#ftn715]It is impossible he can be free who serves passions and is governed by them.716[endnote.xhtml#ftn716]No man is free who does not command himself.717 [endnote.xhtml#ftn717]The labor of continence precedes all excellent things.718 [endnote.xhtml#ftn718]To possess continence is the best strength and wealth.719 [endnote.xhtml#ftn719]It is better to die than to cloud the soul by intemperance.720[endnote.xhtml#ftn720]He said that drunkenness is a little madness; or that it is the study ofmadness; or, as Laertius, that it is the canker of the flower of the mind.721[endnote.xhtml#ftn721]The voice of the flesh is, no hunger, no thirst, no cold.722[endnote.xhtml#ftn722]He admonished all men to shun ambition and vainglory, because these chieflyexcite envy.723 [endnote.xhtml#ftn723]He discouraged all excess, saying that we ought not to exceed a due proportionin labor and food.724 [endnote.xhtml#ftn724]We must consider that there are three kinds of things which deserved to bepursued and acquired. The first is of those which are honorable and virtuous;the second those that assist life; the last, pleasures. Not the vulgarenchanting pleasure—for that he allowed not—but the solid and grave, free fromblame.725 [endnote.xhtml#ftn725] He said there are two kinds of pleasure.Whereof that which indulges to the belly and to lasciviousness by profuseness ofwealth, he compared to the murderous songs of the Sirens. The other, whichconsists in things honest and just, as also in the necessaries of life is sweet,as well as the first, and withal it is not followed by repentance. Hitherperhaps alludes Clemens, who says Pythagoras advised to esteem the Muses sweeterthan Sirens; teaching that we should study learning not with delight; whereby hecondemned the other delight of the mind, which is fallacious.726[endnote.xhtml#ftn726]Pythagoras said, upon seeing one that made himself fat by exercising and eating,“This man will not cease to make a stricter prison for himself.”727[endnote.xhtml#ftn727]The Pythagoreans exhorted such as came into their society to shun pleasure asmuch as anything that ought to be avoided; for nothing so deceives us, and drawsinto sin, as this passion.728 [endnote.xhtml#ftn728] In general, as it seems,they endeavored not to do anything which might tend to pleasure, this scopebeing for the most part indecent and hurtful; but that they should aim at whatis good and decent, to do what they ought. In the next place, to discern what isconvenient and beneficial requires a more than ordinary judgment.As to that which is called desire, they said thus: desire is an impulsion andappetite of the soul, either of some gluttonous habit, or derogation of somethings belonging to sense, or the sensitive affection. This passion is various,and the most multiplicative of all that belong to man. Of human desires, manyare acquired and framed by the persons themselves; wherefore this passionrequires the greatest care and observation and corporeal exercises, more thanordinary. For the body, when its aliment is evacuated, to desire repletion isnatural; and again, being replete, to desire evacuation is natural also. But todesire superfluous aliment, or superfluous and sumptuous raiment and lodging, orsuperfluous and various household stuff, and utensils, and cups, and servants,and herds of cattle, bred for diet—in a word, of all human passions, this ismost such that it never is at a stay, but proceeds to infinite. Wherefore fromour very childhood, care must be taken that we desire such things as areneedful, and shun vain and superfluous desires, being undisturbed and clear fromsuch appetites, and condemning those who deserve contempt, being fettered bytheir desires.It is of most concern to observe the vain, hurtful, superfluous desires of thosewho are transported by their power; there is nothing so absurd, whereto thesouls of such persons—children, men, and women—are not transported. The mostvarious is that of meats. Infinite is the multitude of fruits, infinite ofroots, used by mankind. Besides this, all sorts of flesh, making it theirbusiness to find, of terrestrial, volatile, and aquatile creatures, wherewith tosatisfy their taste; and all variety of dressing them, with the mixture of allkind of juices, whereby mankind is really prophetic and multiform as to themotion of the soul; for every several sort of meat is the cause of a peculiarconstitution. Now men behold that these produce great alteration, as excess ofwine to such a degree exhilarates; further, causes frenzy and disorder. Butthose things which discover not so much their force and efficacy, they areignorant of; notwithstanding that whatsoever food we take is the cause of somepeculiar constitution. Wherefore it is a great part of wisdom to know andunderstand, what kind and quantity of meat is requisite for nourishment. Thisscience was first communicated by Apollo and Pan, afterwards by theAesculapians.Concerning generation, he said thus. We ought principally to observe that whichis called images [images/215.png] precocious†: for neither too forward plantsnor animals before the due season when they are in their full strength.729[endnote.xhtml#ftn729] Youths therefore and virgins ought to be educated inlabor and exercises, and actions conducing to fortitude, using food convenientthereto, and in a laborious, temperant and tolerant life. Of the things in humanlife, there are many in which to be late conversant is best; of this kind iscoition. A youth ought so to be educated, as not to addict himself theretobefore twenty years of age; and when arrived at those years, to use it seldom isbest, if we esteem a good habit of body; for intemperance and good rarely meetin the same person.They recommended the rites and laws of the ancients in Greek cities: not to liewith mothers, or daughters, or sisters, nor in a temple, nor in public. For thisis evil, and to procure all possible impediments thereof is very profitable.They were of opinion, that all unnatural ignominious generations ought to betaken away, and those only preserved which were according to nature, withtemperance, and lawful.They conceived, that such as go about to beget children ought to have muchprovidence of their future issue. The first and greatest providence is toprepare himself for that action by a temperate healthful life, not eating toomuch at unreasonable times, nor using such meats as deprave the habits of thebody; but above all things, not to perform it when drunk. For they thought thatby ill, and discordant, and disturbed temperament, the seed became adulterate.They also thought him a foolish, inconsiderate person who being desirous ofchildren, and taking a wife to that end, should not with utmost study foresee bywhat means his issue might be most advantaged.They who love dogs, are very careful of their breed, as of which they shallbreed, and when, and accordingly the whelps prove. The like do they who lovebirds. But though it be well known that they who breed any other kind of livingcreature use their utmost endeavor to procure a generous race, yet men have norespect to their own offspring, but beget them inconsiderately and bring them upnegligently. This is the chief and most manifest cause that so many men are eviland wicked, the greatest part begetting their children like beasts without anyconsideration.Finally, Pythagoras as discoursing concerning the benefit of venereal pleasures,advised in the summertime to abstain wholly from coition; in the winter to useit but rarely. For it is generally hurtful, and the continual use thereof causesdebility and is most pernicious.730 [endnote.xhtml#ftn730] Laertius says, Headvised, that in the winter and spring it should not be used at all, in summerand autumn but sparingly. For at all times it is pernicious and prejudicial tothe health. And being asked, “At what time a man should use it,” he answered,“When he has a mind to be weaker.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4SAGACITY AND WISDOMTo Wisdom (the last general head of Education) belong these sentences ofPythagoras.The strength, wall, and armor of a wise man is wisdom.731 [endnote.xhtml#ftn731]Call to mind that most men acknowledge wisdom to be the greatest good, but fewendeavor to possess this greatest good.The sacrifices of fools are the food of fire; their donations, the subsistenceof sacrilegious persons.732 [endnote.xhtml#ftn732]A horse is not to be guided without a bridle, nor riches without wisdom.733[endnote.xhtml#ftn733]He conceived the imposition of names on things to be the highest part ofwisdom.734 [endnote.xhtml#ftn734]"},{"pageContent":"OF POLITICS: THE OTHER PART OF PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHYThe heads of Politics (according to Iamblichus) are these: common conversation,friendship, worship of the gods, piety to the dead, and lawmaking.735[endnote.xhtml#ftn735]They hold Pythagoras to be the inventor of all political discipline. He used tosay that amongst beings nothing is pure, but everything partakes of someother—as Earth of Fire, Fire of Water and Air. In like manner, honest partakesof dishonest, just of unjust, and the like. Hence it is that reason is carriedaway to either side. There are two motions: one of the body, the other of themind; one irrational, the other elective. Commonwealths he compared to a RightTriangle, wherein one side consists of three parts, the base of five, the otherside of the mean between them, of four. In the coincidence of these lines withone another, and their squares, we behold delineated the best form of acommonwealth, and of Justice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1COMMON CONVERSATIONTo common conversation belong these maxims of Pythagoras.A just stranger is to be preferred, not only before a countryman, but before akinsman.736 [endnote.xhtml#ftn736]Esteem as a great part of good education to be able to suffer the want ofeducation in others.737 [endnote.xhtml#ftn737]Desire that they who converse with you should rather respect than fear you. Foradmiration accompanies respect; hatred, fear.738 [endnote.xhtml#ftn738]There being a justice in the mutual conversation of men, one towards another, ofthis also the Pythagoreans delivered this manner.739 [endnote.xhtml#ftn739]There is in the common conversation of men one opportune, another importune.They differ in diversity of age, in dignity, in nearness of affinity,beneficence, and if there be anything like these in mutual differences. Forthere is a kind of conversation which appears to the younger towards the youngernot to be importune; but towards the elder, it is importune. For no kind—neitherof anger, nor of menacing, or boldness, but all such kind of importunity oughtdiligently to be avoided by the younger toward the elder. In like manner is thereason of dignity; for coming to a person endowed with true worth and virtue, itis neither decent nor opportune to speak much, or to commit any of theaforementioned things. Like these also are those which concern such as haveobliged and deserved well of others.There is a various and multiple use of opportunity. For of those that are angryand incensed, some do it opportunely, others importunely. And again, of thosewho covet, and desire, and have appetite, it may be opportune for some to pursuethose things, not for others. The same reason there is of other affections,actions, dispositions, conversations, intercessions, and discourses. Butopportunity is of such a nature that it is capable of being taught, andundeceivable, and capable of act, and generally and simply having nothing of allthose in it. But the consequences are of such a kind that they together—decent,and convenient, and the like—attend the nature of opportunity.They held that there is a primacy in everything, and that everywhere there isone thing which is best. In science, in experience, in generation, likewise in afamily, a city, an army, and in all such like constitutions: but it is difficultto discern and understand the nature of the primacy in all the aforesaid things.For in sciences, it is the part of more than ordinary intelligence, by clearintuition, to discern and judge the parts of the thing which is the primacy ofthem. But there is a great difference, and almost of the whole and general ahazard, in not rightly taking the primacy. For in a word, nothing can afterwardsbe right if the true primacy be not known. The same manner and reason is inother kinds of primacy. For neither can a family be well governed where there isnot a true master and voluntary government; for it is requisite that both thesebe voluntary in the prefecture, as well he who is chief as those who are subjectto him. As learning is then right when there is such conformity between themasters and the scholars that they will teach, these will learn; for if eitherhe refractory, it cannot be rightly performed. In this manner he conceived it tobe fit for inferiors to obey superiors, disciples their masters."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2FRIENDSHIPPythagoras evidently demonstrated that there is a friendship of all unto all: ofgods towards men by piety and religious worship; of doctrines to one another; ofthe soul to the body; of the rational part to the irrational by philosophy andits theory; of men towards one another; between countrymen by right observationof laws; between strangers by right physiology; of a man to his wife, orchildren, or brethren, and servants, by unperverted communion.740[endnote.xhtml#ftn740] In a word, of all towards all. Moreover of someirrational creatures by justice and natural affinity and communion; of the body,in itself mortal, a conciliation and combination of the contrary faculties, byhealth and wholesome diet, and temperance, in imitation of the good composure inthe elements. In all these, of one and the same, according to comprehension ofthe name friendship, Pythagoras is acknowledged to be the inventer and lawgiver.And so admirable a friendship did he deliver to those who enquired of him, thatunto this day (says Iamblichus), we say of those who are intimately joinedtogether by friendship, they are of the Pythagoreans.We must add the Institution of Pythagoras herein, and the exhortations he usedto his Disciples. They were advised to take away all contention and love ofcontroversy out of true friendship; if possible out of all. But if that be notpossible, at least out of that which is our own country, and generally thattowards elders. Likewise out of that towards benefactors; for to becomeantagonists or contest with such when we are fallen into anger, or some otherpassion, is not consistent with the preservation of the amity we have with them.They said that in friendship there ought to be least scratches and cuts; and, ifany happen, we should slay and subdue anger. It were best that both should doso, but chiefly the younger, and that those exercises which they called images[images/222.png] [“admonitions”],† ought to be made from the elder towards theyounger with much commendation and benevolence. That there appear much care andtenderness in those who give the correction; for by this means, the correctionshall be profitable. That we do not destroy friendship, neither in jest nor inearnest; for it is not easy to heal the friendship between men, if once afalsehood has incurred into the manners of those who call themselves friends.That we must not renounce friendship for adversity, or any other impotence whichhappens in life. That renunciation of friendship only is commendable which ismade by reason of some great wickedness, and misdemeanor. But that we must nottake away our friendship from them unless they become absolutely wicked. Andbefore we renounce a friend, we must ingeniously pause to see if by challenginghim he may be diverted from this ill habit and become rectified. We must fight,not in words, but actions; the fight is lawful and pious. Though difference ofpower be not a just ground for one man to fight with another, yet this is a justground, even the most just that is possible.They said that to a friendship that will prove true, are required manydefinitions and rules; these must be well discerned, and not confused. Moreover,it ought to be accommodated to the disposition of others that no conversation bemade negligently and vainly, but with respect and right order. Neither that anypassion be excited vainly and wickedly and sinfully, such as concupiscence oranger. The same of the other passions and habits.Much more admirable are those things which they defined concerning the communityof the divine good, and those concerning the unanimity of the mind, and thoseconcerning the Divine Mind. For they mutually exhorted one another, that theyshould not tear asunder the god which is in them. Thus their study of friendshipby words and actions had reference to some divine temperament, and to union withGod, and to unity with the mind, and the divine soul. Thus Iamblichus.He conceived the extremity (or end) of friendship, to be the making one of two.Man ought to be one.741 [endnote.xhtml#ftn741] This sentence (says Clemens) ismystic.742 [endnote.xhtml#ftn742] He first said, images [images/223.png][“friends share in common”], and images [images/223_1.png] [“friendship isequality”].†743 [endnote.xhtml#ftn743]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3WORSHIP OF THE GODSThe principles of worshipping the gods proposed by Pythagoras and his followers,are these.744 [endnote.xhtml#ftn744]That all which they determine to be done, aim and tend to the acknowledgment ofthe deity. This is the principle, and the whole life of man consists in this:that he follow God. This is the ground of philosophy. For men do ridiculouslywho seek that which is good anywhere else than from the gods. They do as if aman in a country, governed by a king, should apply his service to some citizenof inferior magistry and neglect the supreme governor. In the same mannerconceive they that such men do; for since there is a God, we must confess thatgood is in his power. Now all, to those whom they love and delight in, give goodthings; and to the contrary to these, their contraries. Therefore it ismanifest, that such things are to be done in which God delights.Thus he defined particularly of all things. To believe of the divinity that itis; and that it is in such manner as to mankind; that it overlooks them not andneglects them not—such beliefs the Pythagoreans, taught by him, conceived to beprofitable. For we have need of such a government, as we ought not in anythingto contradict; such is that which proceeds from the divinity. For the divinityis such that it merits the dominion of all. Man they affirmed to be, rightlyspeaking, a creature reproachful and fickle as to his appetites, affections, andother passions. He therefore has need of such government and guidance, fromwhich proceeds moderation and order. Now they conceived that everyone, beingconscious of the fickleness of his own nature, should never be forgetful ofsanctity and service towards the Divinity, but always have the Divinity in theirmind; how it overlooks and observes human life.In fine, they say that Pythagoras was an imitator of the Orpheanconstitutions—worshipping the gods after the manner of Orpheus, placed in brazenimages, not representing the forms of men but of the gods themselves, whocomprehending and foreseeing all things, resemble in nature and form the whole.He declared their purifications and rites, which are called images[images/225.png] [“Rites of Fulfillment”],† having the most exact knowledge ofthem.Moreover they affirm, he made a composition of the divine philosophy andservice: part whereof he had learned from the Orpheans; part from the Egyptianpriests; some from the Chaldeans and Magi; some from the Eleusinian Rites; andthose in Imber, and Samothracia, and Delos, and the Celtae, and Iberians.Amongst the Latins also is read the sacred discourse of Pythagoras. Not to all,but to such as are admitted to the doctrine of excellent things, and are notaddicted to ought that is dishonest.It prescribes that men offer libation thrice; and Apollo gives oracles from atripod, because number first consists in a triad.That we must sacrifice to Venus on the sixth day, because that is the firstcommon number of the number of universal nature. Now after all ways, the thingdivided in like manner assumes as well the power of those things which are takenaway as of those which are left.That to Hercules we ought to sacrifice on the eighth day of the month, inrespect of his being born at the end of seven months.It says also, that we ought to enter into a temple having a pure garment, and inwhich none has slept the sleep of slothfulness; black and russet, testifyingpurity in ratiocinations of equality and justice.It commanded, that if blood be shed unwillingly in a temple, that it be eithertaken up in a dish or scattered into the sea; for that is the first element, andmost estimable of all creatures.It says likewise, that a woman ought not to be brought to bed in a temple, forit is religious; that the divinity of the soul should be annexed to the body ina temple.It commanded that upon holy days we cut not our hair, nor pare our nails;intimating that the increase of our goods ought not to be preferred before theempire of the gods.That we must not kill a flea in the temple, because to the deity we ought not tooffer any superfluous things, or vermin. But that the gods are to be worshippedwith cedar, laurel, cypress, and myrtle, etc.He said piety and religion are chiefly conversant in our minds, at such time aswe attend the divine rites.745 [endnote.xhtml#ftn745]He taught that the gods and heroes are not to be worshipped with equalhonors.746 [endnote.xhtml#ftn746] But that the gods must always be worshippedwith applause (or silence at the celebration of their rites), we being white andpure. Heroes are to be worshipped only from noon. He advised that such assacrifice should present themselves to the gods, not in rich, but in white andclean garments; and that not only the body be clear from all blemish, but thatthey bring also a pure mind.747 [endnote.xhtml#ftn747] Purity is acquired byexpiations, and bathings, and sprinklings; and by refraining from murder, andadultery, and all pollution; and by abstaining from the flesh of things that dieof themselves, and from mullets, and melanures, and sheep, and oviparouscreatures, and beans, and all other things which are commanded by those who havethe care of sacred rites.He permitted not that any man should pray for himself, because none knows whatis good for himself.748 [endnote.xhtml#ftn748]An Oath is just, and therefore Jupiter is surnamed'' images [images/226.png][“of oaths”]†.749 [endnote.xhtml#ftn749] He commanded his disciples to be verybackward and cautious in taking an Oath; but that when they have taken it, theyshould be very forward and diligent to keep it. 750 [endnote.xhtml#ftn750]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4PIETY TO THE DEADPiety to the dead was a part, not the least, of the Pythagorean doctrine. WhenceCicero, speaking of the immortality of the soul: “More prevalent with me,” sayshe, “is the authority of the ancients, or our ancestors, who afforded the deadreligious rites—which certainly they had not done if they had conceived thatnothing pertains to them; or of those who were in this country and instructedMagna Graecia (which now is abolished but then flourished), with theirinstitutions and precepts.”751 [endnote.xhtml#ftn751]Pythagoras allowed not the bodies of the dead to be burned, herein imitating theMagi, as not willing that any mortal should participate of divine honor.752[endnote.xhtml#ftn752] The Pythagorean custom, as described by Pliny, was to putthe dead into earthen barrels amongst leaves of myrtle, olive, and blackpoplar.753 [endnote.xhtml#ftn753]To accompany the dead at funerals in white garments he conceived to be pious;alluding to the simple and first nature, according to number, and the principleof all things.754 [endnote.xhtml#ftn754]The Crotonians delighted in burying their dead sumptuously. One of thePythagoreans told them he had heard Pythagoras discoursing of divine thingsthus:“The celestial gods respect the affections of the sacrificers, not the greatnessof the sacrifice. On the contrary, the terrestrial gods, as to whose share thelesser things belong, delight in banquets, and mournings, and funeral litations,and costly sacrifices. Whence Hades (the Infernal Regions), from its makingchoice of entertainment, is named Pluto. Those who pay honors to him mostsparingly he permits to continue longest in the upper world. But of those whoare excessive in mourning, he brings down ever and anon one, that thereby he mayreceive the honors which are paid in memory of the dead.”By this discourse he wrought a belief in his Auditors that they who do allthings moderately upon such adverse occasions further their own safety; but asfor those who bestow excessive charge, they will all die untimely.755[endnote.xhtml#ftn755]They forbore to make tombs of Cypress, forasmuch as Jupiter's scepter was ofthat wood, as Hermippus, in his second book of Pythagoras, affirms.756[endnote.xhtml#ftn756]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5REVERENCE OF PARENTS, AND OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWNext to gods and daemons, we ought to reverence parents and the law; and torender ourselves obedient to them, not falsely, but really.757[endnote.xhtml#ftn757] Or as Porphyry says, “He commanded to think and to speakreverently of gods and daemons, to be kind to parents and benefactors, and toobey the law.”758 [endnote.xhtml#ftn758]They held (says Iamblichus) that we ought to believe, there is no greater illthan anarchy; for a man cannot be safe, where there is no governor.759[endnote.xhtml#ftn759] They held also that we ought to persevere in the customsand rites of our own country, though they be worse than those of othercountries. To revolt easily from settled laws, and to be studious of novelty,they conceived to be neither advantageous nor safe.Seeing that contumelies, pride, and contempt of law often transport men tounjust actions, he daily exhorted, that the law should be assisted and injusticeopposed.760 [endnote.xhtml#ftn760] To which end he alleged this distinction: Thefirst of ills, which insinuates itself into houses and cities, is pride; thesecond, insolence; the third, destruction. Everyone therefore ought to expel andextirpate pride, accustoming himself from his youth to a temperate masculinelife, and to be free from slanderous repining, contentious reproaching, andhateful scurrility.Wickedness disobeys the Divine Law, and therefore transgresses.761[endnote.xhtml#ftn761]A wicked man suffers more torment in his own conscience than he who is punishedin body and whipped.762 [endnote.xhtml#ftn762]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6LAWMAKINGMoreover, says Iamblichus, he constituted another excellent kind of Justice, thelegislative part, which commands that which ought to be done, and forbids thatwhich ought not to be done. This is better than the judicative part. For thejudicative resembles that part of medicine which cures the sick, but thelegislative suffers them not to fall sick, but takes care afar off of the healthof the soul.Varro affirms that Pythagoras delivered this discipline (of governing states) tohis auditors last of all—when they were now learned, now wise, now happy. For hesaw so many rough waves therein, that he would not commit it but to such a oneas was able to shun the rocks; or if all failed, might stand himself as a rockamidst those waves.763 [endnote.xhtml#ftn763]They who punish not ill persons would have the good injured.764[endnote.xhtml#ftn764]"},{"pageContent":"THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY: ITS PARTS AND FIRST OF THE SCIENCE CONCERNINGINTELLIGIBLESWe come next to the theoretical part, to which more particularly belongs thatsaying of Pythagoras: that by philosophy be had this advantage—to admirenothing.

But whoever thinks either belief in the gods or divination a folly, to himthe other is such also.Pythagoras approved all kinds of divination, except that which is performed bythe sacrifice of living creatures.778 [endnote.xhtml#ftn778]He first used divination by frankincense.779 [endnote.xhtml#ftn779] This was theonly burnt offering by which he divined.780 [endnote.xhtml#ftn780]He also used divination by Cledons,781 [endnote.xhtml#ftn781] and by birds,which Cicero confirms, saying that he would himself be an augur;782[endnote.xhtml#ftn782] and that the Pythagoreans observed not only the voices ofthe gods, but of men also, which they call omens.783 [endnote.xhtml#ftn783]Cledons are observations of occurrent speeches, collecting from what isaccidentally said upon some other occasion, the effect of what is sought: aninstance whereof, see in the Epigram of Callimachus upon Pittacus.784[endnote.xhtml#ftn784]The interpretation of dreams, Porphyry says, he learned of the Hebrews. Hecommunicated it also to his disciples; for Iamblichus relates he used means toprocure them quiet sleeps with good and prophetic dreams. For this reason, someconceive, it was that he forbade flatulent and gross meats, for that theyobstruct the serenity which is requisite thereto. Such apparitions he held notto be fantastic but real (not images [images/235.png] “a dream” but images[images/235_1.png] “in reality”), as is manifest from one who told him that hedreamed he had talked with his father who was dead, and asked him what itportended. “Nothing,” says he, “for you did really talk with him. As my speakingnow to you portends nothing, nor did that.”785 [endnote.xhtml#ftn785]He was skillful likewise in judicial Astrology, if we credit Apuleius, whoaffirms the Chaldeans showed him the science of the stars, the number of theplanets, their stations, revolutions, and the various effects of both in thenativities of men.786 [endnote.xhtml#ftn786]Varro relates him skillful in Hydromancy,787 [endnote.xhtml#ftn787] which (sayshe) came from Persia, and was practiced by Numa, and afterwards by Pythagoras;wherein they used blood, and invocation of daemons.Eustathius says the Pythagoreans affirm that all brass does sound by somediviner spirit, for which reason a tripod of that metal is dedicated to Apollo.And when the winds are all laid, the air calm, and all things else quiet, yetthe hollow brass caldrons seem to quake.788 [endnote.xhtml#ftn788] The same maybe the meaning of Pythagoras when he says, “The sound which is made by brass, isthe voice of the voice of the Daemon enclosed in the brass.”789[endnote.xhtml#ftn789] (Reading, perhaps, images [images/236.png].)For so Psellus describes a kind of hydromancy practiced by the Assyrians: Theytake a basin full of water convenient for the daemons to glide into the bottom.The basin of water seems to make a noise as if it breathed. The water in thebasin in substance differs nothing from other water—but through the virtueinfused thereinto by charms is much more excellent, and made more ready toreceive a prophetic spirit. This is a particular daemon, terrestrial, attractedby compositions. As soon as he glides into the water, he makes a little soundinarticulate, which denotes his presence. Afterwards the water running over,there are certain whispers heard with some prediction of the future. This kindof spirit is very wandering, because it is of the solar order, and this kind ofdaemons purposely speak with a low voice, that by reason of the indistinctobscurity of the voice, their lies may be less subject to discovery. HithertoPsellus."},{"pageContent":"PHYSICThe general heads of Physic are these: of the world, and of all things in theworld, of Heaven, and of Earth, and of the natures between them.790[endnote.xhtml#ftn790] The defect of the fragments concerning these, we shallendeavor to supply by adding the Treatise of Timaeus the Locrian upon the samesubject.

They first examine words, because language consists of words; then,because words consist of syllables, they next consider syllables; and becausesyllables consist of letters, they next examine letters. In like manner, say thePythagoreans, natural philosophers, when they make enquiry into the universe,must first examine into what the universe is resolved.Now to affirm that something apparent to sense is the principle of all things isrepugnant to Physic. For whatsoever is apparent to sense must be compounded ofthings not apparent. Whereas a principle is not that which consists of anything, but that of which the thing consists. Therefore things apparent cannot besaid to be principles of the universe, but those of which things apparentconsist, themselves not being apparent.They who maintain atoms, or Homoeomeries, or bulks, or intelligible bodies, tobe the principles of all things were partly in the right, partly not. Asconceiving the principles to be unapparent, they are in the right; as holdingthem to be corporeal, they err. For as intelligible unapparent bodies precedethe sensible, so must incorporeals precede intelligible bodies. The elements ofwords are not words; nor of bodies, bodies. But they must either be bodies orincorporeal; therefore they are wholly incorporeal.Neither can we say that Atoms are eternal, and therefore though corporeal, theprinciples of all things. For first they who assert Homoeomeries, and bulks, andleasts, and indivisibles, to be elements, conceive their substance eternal; soas in that respect, Atoms are no more elements than they. Again, though it weregranted that atoms were eternal, yet they who conceive the world to beunbegotten and eternal, enquire by an imaginary way the principles whereof itfirst consists. So we (say the Pythagoreans), treating of Physic, consider in animaginary way of what things these eternal bodies, comprehensible only byreason, consist.Thus the Universe consists either of bodies or incorporeals. We cannot saybodies, for then we must assign other bodies whereof they consist; and soproceeding to infinite, we shall remain without a principle. It rests thereforeto affirm that intelligible bodies consist of incorporeals, which Epicurusconfesses, saying, “By collection of figure, and magnitude, and resistance, andgravity, is understood a body.”Yet it is not necessary that all corporeals preexistent to bodies be theelements and first principles of beings. Ideas (according to Plato) areincorporeals, pre-existent to bodies, and all generated beings have reference tothem; yet they are not the principles of being. For every Idea, singly taken, issaid to be one; when we comprehend others with it, they are two, or three, orfour. Number therefore is transcendent to their substance, by participationwhereof, one, two, or more, are predicated of them. Again, solid figures areconceived in the mind before bodies, as having an incorporeal nature; yet theyare not the principles. Superficies precede them in our imagination, for solidsconsist of superficies. But neither are superficies the elements of beings, forthey consist of lines; lines precede them; numbers precede lines. That whichconsists of three lines, is called a Triangle; that which of four, a Quadrangle.Even line itself, simply taken, is not conceived without number—but beingcarried on from one point to another, is conceived in two. As to Numbers, theyall fall under the Monad. For the Duad is one Duad, the Triad one Triad, and theDecad one summary of number.This moved Pythagoras to say, that the principle of all things is the Monad, byparticipation hereof, every being is termed One. And when we reflect on a beingin its identity, we consider a Monad. But when it receives addition by theother, it produces indeterminate Duad, so called in distinction from theArithmetical determinate Duads, by participation whereof all Duads areunderstood as Monads by the Monad. Thus there are two principles of beings, thefirst Monad, and the indeterminate Duad.That these are indeed the principles of all things, the Pythagoreans reachvariously. Of beings (say they), some are understood by Difference, others byContrariety, others by Relation. By difference are those which are considered bythemselves subjected by their proper circumscription: as, a man, a horse, aplant, earth, water, air, fire; each of these is considered absolutely withoutany comparison. By contrariety are those which are considered by one to theother: as good and ill, just and unjust, profitable and unprofitable, sacred andprofane, pious and impious, moving and fixed, and the like. By relation arethose which are considered by relation to others: as right to left, upwards todownwards, double to half. For right is understood by a relative habit to left,and left by a relative habit to right; upwards to downwards, and downward toupwards; and so on of the rest.Those which are understood by contrariety differ from those that are understoodby relation. In contraries, the corruption of the one is the generation ofanother: as of health, sickness, motion, rest. The induction of sickness is theexpulsion of health, and the induction of health is the expulsion of sickness;the same in grief and joy, good and ill, and all things of contrary natures. Butthe relative exist together, and perish together. For right is nothing unlessthere be left; double is nothing unless we understand the half whereof it is thedouble. Moreover, in contraries there is no mean, as between health andsickness, life and death, motion and rest. But between relatives there is amean—as between greater and lesser, the mean is equal; between too much and toolittle, sufficient; between too flat and too sharp, concord.Above these three kinds—absolute, contrary, relative—there must necessarily besome Supreme Genus; every genus is before the species which are under it. For ifthe Genus be taken away, the species are taken away also; but the removal of thespecies takes not away the genus; the species depending on the genus, not thegenus on the species. The transcending genus of those things which areunderstood by themselves (according to the Pythagoreans) is the One. That existsand is considered absolutely, so they say. Of contraries, equal and unequal,holds the place of a genus; for in them is considered the nature of allcontrarieties. By example, of rest in equality, it admits not intension andremission; of motion or inequality, it admits intension and remission. In likemanner, natural inequality is the instable extremity; preternatural inequalityadmits intension and remission. The same of health and sickness, straightnessand crookedness. The relative consists of excess and defect as their genus;great and greater, much and more, high and higher, are understood by excess:little and less, low and lower, by defect.Now forasmuch as absolutes, contraries, and relatives appear to be subordinateto other genera (that is, to one, to equality and inequality, to excess anddefect), let us examine whether those genera may be reduced to others. Equalityis reducible to one, for one is equal in itself; inequality is either in excessor defect; of unequals, one exceeds, the other is deficient. Excess and defectare reducible to the indeterminate Duad; for the first excess and defect is intwo, in the excedent and the deficient. Thus the principles of all things appearabove all the rest in the first Monad and the indeterminate Duad.Of these are generated the Arithmetical Monad and Duad. From the first Monad,one; from the Monad and the indeterminate Duad, two. The Duad, being not yetconstituted amongst Numbers, neither was there two before it was taken out ofthe indeterminate Duad. From the indeterminate Duad, together with the Monad,was produced the Duad which is in Numbers. Out of these, in the same mannerproceeded the rest of the Numbers: one continually stepping forward, theindeterminate Duad generating two, and extending Numbers to an infinitemultitude.Hereupon they affirm that, in principles, Monad has the nature of the efficientcause, Duad of passive matter. And after the same manner as they producedNumbers, which consists of them, they composed the world also and all things init.A Point is correspondent to the Monad. The Monad is indivisible, so is thePoint; the Monad is the principle of Numbers, so is the Point of Lines. A Lineis correspondent to the Duad; both are considered by transition. A line islength without breath, extended between two points. A Superficies corresponds tothe Triad. Besides length, whereby it was a Duad, it receives a third distance,breadth. Again, settling down three points: two opposite, the third at thejuncture of the lines made by the two, we represent a superficies. The solidfigure and the body (as a pyramid) answer the Tetrad. If we lay down, as before,three points, and set over them another point—behold the pyramidical form of asolid body, which has three dimensions, length, breadth, thickness.Some there are who affirm that a body consists of one point; the point byfluxion makes a line; the line by fluxion makes a superficies; the superficiesmoved to thickness makes a body in three dimensions. This sect of thePythagoreans differs from the former. They held that of two principles—the Monadand the Duad—were made Numbers; of Numbers were made Points, Lines, Superficies,and Solids. These hold that all things come from one point—for of it is made aline, of the line a superficies, of the superficies a body.Thus are solid bodies produced of numbers precedent to them. Moreover, of themconsist Solids, Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and in a word, the whole World; whichis governed according to Harmony—as they affirm again—recurring to Numbers whichcomprise the proportions that constitute perfect Harmony.792[endnote.xhtml#ftn792] Harmony is a system consisting of three concords: theDiatessaron, the Diapente, the Diapason; the proportions of these three concordsare found in the first four numbers: one, two, three, four. The Diatessaronconsists in a sesquitertia proportion. The Diapason is in sesquialtera. TheDiapente is in duple. Four being sesquitertius to three (as consisting of threeand one third) has a Diatessaron proportion; three being sesquialter to two (ascontaining two and its half), a Diapente; four being the double of the Monad oftwo, a Diapason. The Tetractys affording the analogy of these concords, whichmake perfect harmony, according to which all things are governed, they styledit:The root and fountain of eternal nature.Moreover, whatsoever is comprehended by man (say they) either is a body orincorporeal; but neither of these is comprehended without the notion of numbers.A body, having a triple dimension, denotes the number three. Besides of bodies,some are by connection: as ships, chains, buildings; others by union comprisedunder one habit: as plants and animals; others by aggregation: as armies andherds. All these have numbers, as consisting of plurality. Moreover of bodies:some have simple qualities, others multiplex. Examples include an apple, variouscolors to the sight, juice to the taste, odor to the smell; these also are ofthe nature of numbers. It is the same of incorporeals. Time, an incorporeal, iscomprehended by number: years, months, days, and hours. The like of a Point, aLine, a Superficies, as we said already.Likewise to numbers are correspondent both naturals and artificials. We judgeeverything by criteria, which are the measures of numbers. If we take awaynumber, we take away the cubit, which consists of two half-cubits, six palms,twenty four digits. We take away the bushel, the balance, and all othercriteria, which, consisting of plurality, are kinds of number. In a word, thereis nothing in life without it. All art is a collection of comprehensions.Collection implies number; it is therefore rightly said:To number all things reference have.That is to determinative reason, which is of the same kind with numbers, whereofall consists. Hitherto Sextus.The sum of all (as said by Alexander in his Successions, extracted out of thePythagorean commentaries) is this: the Monad is the principle of all things.793[endnote.xhtml#ftn793] From the Monad came the indeterminate Duad. As mattersubjected to the cause, Monad; from the Monad and the indeterminate Duad cameNumbers. From Numbers came Points. From Points came Lines; from Lines,Superficies; from Superficies, Solids; from these, solid bodies. Solid bodiesare composed of four elements: Fire, Water, Air, Earth; of all which,transmutated and totally changed, the world consists."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2OF THE WORLDThe World, or comprehension of all things, Pythagoras called images[images/244.png] [“order”], from its order and beauty.794 [endnote.xhtml#ftn794]The world795 [endnote.xhtml#ftn795] was made by God,796 [endnote.xhtml#ftn796]in thought, not in time.797 [endnote.xhtml#ftn797] He gave it a beginning fromfire and the fifth element.

This being injected images [images/250.png] [“inthe womb”], purulent matter, moisture, and blood issue from the brain, whereofflesh, nerves, bones, hair, and the whole body consists. (The power of seed isincorporeal as the motive mind; but the effused matter corporeal.) From thevapor comes the soul and sense; it is first compacted and coagulated in fortydays. And being perfected according to harmonical proportions in seven, nine, orten months (at the farthest), the Infant is brought forth, having allproportions of life; of which (aptly connected according to the proportions ofharmony) it consists; all things happening to it at certain times. ThusAlexander, out of the Pythagorean commentaries.The proportions themselves are more exactly delivered by Censorinus thus.824[endnote.xhtml#ftn824] Pythagoras said that generally there are two kinds ofbirths: one lesser, of seven months; which comes into the world the 207th dayafter the conception. The other greater, of ten months; which is brought forthin the 274th day. The first and lesser is chiefly contained in the number six.For that which is conceived of the seed (as he says) the six first days, is amilky substance; the next eight days, bloody; which eight with the six make thefirst concord, Diatessaron. The third degree is of nine days; in which time, itis made flesh. These to the first six are in sesquialtera proportion, and makethe second concord, Diapente. Then follow twelve days more in which the body isfully formed. These to the same six consist in duple proportion, and make theDiatessaron concord. These four numbers, six, eight, nine, twelve, addedtogether make thirty-five days; nor without reason is the number six thefoundation of generation. For the Greeks call it images [images/250_1.png] weperfect; because its three parts perfect it. Now as the beginnings of the seedand that milky foundation of conception is first completed by this number, sothis is the beginning of the man now formed. And, as it were, another foundationof maturity which is of thirty-five days, being multiplied by six, makes 220days in which this maturity is fulfilled.The other (greater) birth is contained in the greater number seven. And as thebeginning of the former is in six days, after which the seed is converted intoblood, so that of this is in seven. And as there the members of the Infant areformed in thirty-five days; so here in about forty. These forty days beingmultiplied by the first seven, make 280 days, that is forty weeks.

That part which isthe heart is images [images/252_7.png] [“passion”], but images[images/252_8.png] [“reason”] and images [images/252_9.png] [“intelligence”] arein the brain. The senses are distillations from these: the rational part isimmortal, the rest mortal. The soul is nourished by blood, and the faculties ofthe soul are spirits. Both the soul and her faculties are invisible, for Aetheris invisible. The fetters of the soul are veins, arteries, and nerves. But whenshe is strong, and composed within herself, her fetters are reasons and actions.Every sense is derived from its proper element. Sight is from Aether, hearingfrom air, smelling from fire, taste from water, touch from earth.832[endnote.xhtml#ftn832]Sense in general, and particulary sight, is a vapor very hot. For this reason weare said to see through air and through water, for the heat pierces the cold.For if that which is in the eyes were a cold vapor, it would fight with theair—which is like it hot. In some places, he calls the eyes the gates of theSun; the same he determined concerning hearing and the rest of the senses.Sight is the judge of colors.833 [endnote.xhtml#ftn833] Color they call thesuperficies of a body. The kinds of color are black, white, red, pale.834[endnote.xhtml#ftn834] Or, as the anonymous writer delivers the opinion ofPythagoras, ten: black, white, and the rest between them, yellow, tawney, pale,red, blue, green, bright, grey.835 [endnote.xhtml#ftn835] The differences ofcolors are derived from the mixture of the elements, and, in living creatures,from variety of place and of air.The image in a mirror is made by reflection of the sight.836[endnote.xhtml#ftn836] This, being extended to the brass, and meeting with athick smooth body, is pushed back and returns into itself, as when the hand isstretched forth and again brought back to the shoulder.837[endnote.xhtml#ftn837]Hearing is the judge of voice, sharp and flat.838 [endnote.xhtml#ftn838] Voiceis incorporeal; for not air, but the figure and superficies of air, by a strokebecomes voice.

The other four senses areseated in the head only and confined to their proper organs. But touching isdiffused through the head, and the whole body. It is common to every sense, butexhibits its judgment most manifestly by the hands."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4OF THE RATIONAL PART OF THE SOUL: THE MINDAccording to Plutarch, Pythagoras defined the soul as, “A self-moving number,”adding that he takes number to be the same as a mind.841 [endnote.xhtml#ftn841]The mind, images [images/254.png] is induced into the soul ab extrinseco, fromwithout, by divine participation842 [endnote.xhtml#ftn842] images[images/254_1.png] culled out as a small part of the universal Divine Mind.843[endnote.xhtml#ftn843] For there is a soul intent and penetrating in alldirections through the whole nature of things844 [endnote.xhtml#ftn844] fromwhich our souls are plucked.845 [endnote.xhtml#ftn845] She is immortal, becausethat from which she is taken is immortal, yet not a god—but the work of theeternal God.846 [endnote.xhtml#ftn846] Thus Pythagoras confirmed the opinion ofhis master Pherecides, who first taught that the souls of men are sempiternal.Our Souls (said he) consist of a tetrad: mind, science, opinion, sense. Fromthis tetrad proceeds all art and science by which we ourselves are rational.847[endnote.xhtml#ftn847] The mind therefore is a monad, for the mind considersaccording to a monad. By way of example, there are many men. These, one by one,are incomprehensible by sense and innumerable. But we understand this one man towhich none has resemblance. And we understand one horse, for the particulars areinnumerable. Thus every genus and species is according to monad, wherefore toeveryone in particular they apply this definition—whether a rational creature ora neighing creature. Hence is the mind a monad, whereby we understand thesethings. The indeterminate duad is science. For all demonstration, and all beliefof science, and likewise all syllogism from some things granted, infer thatwhich is doubted. And they easily demonstrate another thing, the comprehensionwhereof is science. Therefore it is as the duad. Opinion is justly a triad,being of many. Triad implies a multitude, as, thrice happy Greeks—(The rest ofthe text is wanting.)The Pythagoreans assert eight organs of knowledge: Sense, Phantasie, Art,Opinion, Prudence, Science, Wisdom, Mind.848 [endnote.xhtml#ftn848] Of these, wehave in common with divine natures, art, prudence, science, mind. With beasts weshare sense and Phantasie. Only opinion is proper to us. Sense is a deceitfulknowledge through the body; Phantasie, a motion in the soul; art, a habit ofoperating with reason. We add, “with reason,” for a spider also operates, butwithout reason. Prudence is a habit elective of that which is right in things tobe done. Science is a habit of those things which are always the same and in thesame manner. Wisdom is a knowledge of the First Cause. Mind is the principle andfountain of all good things."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5OF THE TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOULWhat he delivered to his auditors (says Porphyry) none can certainly affirm, forthere was a great and strict silence observed amongst them.849[endnote.xhtml#ftn849] But the most known are these: First, he said that thesoul is immortal; then, that it enters into other kinds of living creatures.(Or, as Laertius expresses it: He first asserted that the soul, passing throughthe circle of necessity, lives as several times in different livingcreatures.)850 [endnote.xhtml#ftn850] Moreover, that after some periods, thesame things that are now generated are generated again; that nothing is simplynew. And that we ought to esteem all animate creatures to be of the same kindwith us.These doctrines Pythagoras seems to have brought first into Greece. DiodorusSiculus affirms, he learned them of the Egyptians.851 [endnote.xhtml#ftn851]They were the first who asserted that the soul of man is immortal, and the bodyperishing, it always passes into another body. And when it has run through allthings terrestrial, marine, volatile, it again enters into some generated humanbody. This circuit is completed in three thousand years. This opinion (addsHerodotus) some of the Greeks have usurped as their own—some more ancient,others later—whose names knowingly I omit.852 [endnote.xhtml#ftn852]Pythagoras (says Theodoret), Plato, Plotinus, and the rest of that sectacknowledged souls to be immortal. They asserted that souls are preexistent tobodies, and that there is an innumerable company of souls. Those whichtransgress are sent down into bodies, so as being purified by such discipline,they may return to their own place. Those which while they are in bodies lead awicked life, are sent down farther into irrational creatures, hereby to receivepunishment and right expiation: the angry and malicious into serpents, theravenous into wolves, the audacious into lions, the fraudulent into foxes, andthe like.Upon this ground (as some conceive) it was that he forbade to eat flesh.853[endnote.xhtml#ftn853] For we ought to esteem all animals creatures to be of thesame kind with us,854 [endnote.xhtml#ftn854] and to have common right with us,and to be allied (in a manner) to us.855 [endnote.xhtml#ftn855] Whence a bean isby Horace styled cognata Pythagorae, because he forbade it to be eaten upon thegrounds that men and beans arose out of the same putrefaction.856[endnote.xhtml#ftn856]This assertion he defended by many instances, particularly of himself.Heraclides relates the following.857 [endnote.xhtml#ftn857] Pythagoras said hehad been in former times Aethalides, esteemed the son of Mercury. (Aethalideswas a powerful orator who wrote two treatises, the one mournful, the otherpleasant.858 [endnote.xhtml#ftn858] Like Democritus and Heraclitus, he bewailedand derided the instability of life, and was said to die and live from day today.) Pythagoras related that Mercury bade him (as Aethalides) requestwhatsoever he would, immortality only excepted. He desired that he mightpreserve the remembrance of all actions, alive and dead. Whereupon he rememberedall things while he lived, and after death, retained the same memory. Thatafterwards he came to be Euphorbus and was slain by Menelaus.Now Euphorbus said that he had been in former times Aethalides, and that he hadreceived this gift from Mercury: to know the migration of the soul as it passedfrom one body to another; and into what plants and animals it migrated; and whatthing his soul suffered after death; and what other souls suffered. Euphorbusdying, his soul passed into Hermotimus. Now Hermotimus, desiring to profess whohe was, went to the Branchidae. Coming into the Temple of Apollo, he pointed tothe shield which Menelaus had hung up there. He said, that upon his return fromTroy, he had dedicated that shield to Apollo, it being then old, and nothingremaining but the Ivory stock. (But Porphyry and Iamblichus affirm it wasdedicated, together with other Trojan spoils, to Argive Iano in her Temple atMycenae.)As soon as Hermotimus died, he became Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, and againremembered all things: how he had been first Aethalides, then Euphorbus, thenHermotimus, and lastly Pyrrhus. When Pyrrhus died, he became Pythagoras, andremembered all that we have said.Others relate that he said he had been first Euphorbus; secondly, Aethalides;thirdly, Hermotimus; fourthly, Pyrrhus; and lastly, Pythagoras.859[endnote.xhtml#ftn859] Clearchus and Dicaearchus said that he had been firstEuphorbus; then Pyrander; then Calliclea; then a beautiful courtesan, namedAlce.860 [endnote.xhtml#ftn860] For this reason, of all Homer's verses he didespecially praise these, and set them to the harp, and often repeated them ashis own funeral ode.As by some hand, a tender Olive setIn a lone place, near a smooth Rivolet:Fair she shoots up, and, fan'd on every sideBy amorous winds, displays her blooming pride;Until some churlish unexpected gustPlows up her root, and buries her in dust.So by Alcides slain Euphorbus lay,Stretch'd on the ground, his Arms the Victor's prey.Hence in his person, Ovid.861 [endnote.xhtml#ftn861]O you, whom horrors of cold death affright,Why fear you Styx? vain names, and endless night,The dreams of Poets, and feign'd miseriesOf forged Hell? Whether last-flames surprise,Or age devours your bodies; they nor grieve,Nor suffer pains. Our souls for ever live:Yet evermore their ancient houses leaveTo live in new, which them, as guests receive.In Trojan Wars, I (I remember well)Euphorbus was, Pantheus son, and fellBy Menelaus Lance: my shield againAt Argos late I saw in Juno's fane.All alter, nothing finally decays;Hither and thither still the spirit strays,Guest to all bodies, out of beasts it flysTo men, from men to beasts, and never dies.As pliant wax each new impression takes,Fixed to no form, but still the old forsakes,Yet is the same: so souls the same abide,Though various species their reception hide.Then lest thy greedy belly should destroy(I prophesy) depressed piety,For bear t'expulse thy kindreds Ghosts with foodBy death procur'd, nor nourish blood with blood.862 [endnote.xhtml#ftn862]Neither did he instance himself only, but put many others also in mind of theaccidents of their former life: how they had lived before their souls wereconfined the second time to the body.863 [endnote.xhtml#ftn863] This he did(adds Porphyry864 [endnote.xhtml#ftn864]) to those whose souls were rightlypurified, such was Millias of Crotona, whom he caused to call to memory, that hehad been Midas son of Gordias. Whereupon Millias went to Epire to perform someFuneral rites as he appointed.865 [endnote.xhtml#ftn865]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE SEPARATE LIFE OF THE SOULThe soul has a twofold life: separate from, and within the body.

The impure comenot to them, nor to one another, but are bound by the Furies in indissolublechains.The Pythagoreans affirmed that the souls of the dead neither cast a shadow, norwink; for that it is the Sun which causes the shadow.869 [endnote.xhtml#ftn869]But he who enters there is by the law of the place deprived of the Sun's light,which they signify in that speech.Pythagoras held that earthquakes proceed from no other cause but the meeting ofthe dead.870 [endnote.xhtml#ftn870]"},{"pageContent":"MEDICINETo physic we shall annex, as its immediate consequent, medicine.

Sickness, the violationof it.876 [endnote.xhtml#ftn876]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1DIETETICSOf medicine, the Pythagoreans chiefly applied themselves to the Dietetic part,and were most exact in that. They endeavored first to understand the proportion,not only of labor, but likewise of food and rest.877 [endnote.xhtml#ftn877] Thenconcerning the dressing of such meats, they were almost the first who endeavoredto comment and to define.Forasmuch as diet does much conduce to good institution, being wholesome andregular, let us examine what he decreed therein. Of meats, he absolutelydisallowed such as are flatulent and disorder the body. On the contrary, heapproved and commanded those which confirm and unite the constitution—whence hejudged millets to be a convenient food.But he also wholly forbade such meats as are not used by the gods, because theyseparate us from the correspondence which we have with them.Likewise he advised to abstain from such meats as are esteemed sacred, whichdeserve a respect, and are nothing convenient for the ordinary use of man.Whatsoever meats obstructed divination, or were prejudicial to the purity andsanctity of the mind, or to temperance and habitual virtue, he advised to shun.As also those which are contrary to purity, and defile the Imaginations whichoccur in sleep, and the other purities of the soul, he rejected and avoided.878[endnote.xhtml#ftn878]These rules concerning diet he prescribed generally to all persons, but moreparticularly to philosophers who are most addicted to contemplation of thesublimest things.879 [endnote.xhtml#ftn879] He denied at once all superfluousmeats as were unlawful to be eaten, not permitting them at any time to feed onthat which had life, or to drink wine, or to sacrifice to the gods any livingcreature, or hurt any of them. But he commanded with all exactness to preservethe justice which belongs even to them. In this manner he lived himself,abstaining from the flesh of living creatures, and worshipping unbloody altars.He took care that others should not put tame beasts to death. And himself makingthe savage tame, and moderating and instituting them both by words and actions;but by no means would he punish or kill them.He likewise commanded civil lawgivers to abstain from the flesh of livingcreatures, because it behooved them—who would make use of the height ofjustice—no way to injure living creatures which are of affinity with us. For howcan they persuade other men to do just things, who themselves are transported byavarice to feed on living creatures—which are of affinity with us; allied in amanner to us; and, through the community of life, consisting of the temperamentand commixture of the same elements.880 [endnote.xhtml#ftn880]But to others whose life was not extraordinary pure, sacred, and philosophical,he prescribed a certain time for abstinence.881 [endnote.xhtml#ftn881] To thosehe decreed that they should not eat the heart, and that they should not eat thebrain. And these are prohibited to all Pythagoreans: for they are leaders, and,as it were, seats and houses of wisdom and life. But these were consecrated bythe nature of the divine word.In like manner he prohibited mallows, as being the first messenger andinterpreter of celestial affections, and (as I may say) compassions towards men.Likewise he commanded to abstain from the melanure (a fish so called from theblackness of its tail) because it is peculiar to the terrestrial deities.He forbade also the Erythrine for the like reasons.Also to abstain from beans, for many reasons divine and natural, referring tothe soul.The Pythagoreans at dinner used bread and honey.882 [endnote.xhtml#ftn882] Winethey drank not between meals. At supper, wine, and grain, and bread, and broth,and herbs, both raw and boiled. They likewise set before them the flesh ofsacrificed beasts. They seldom ate broths of fish, because some of them are insome respects very hurtful. Likewise seldom the flesh of such creatures as donot hurt mankind.As concerning the diet of Pythagoras himself,883 [endnote.xhtml#ftn883] hisdinner consisted of honeycombs or honey; his supper of bread made of millet. Heate bread with a relish or spread made of boiled or raw salads, very seldom ofthe flesh of sacrificed victims (and that not promiscuously of every part), andseldom of seafish.884 [endnote.xhtml#ftn884]When he chose to go into the private places of the gods and to stay there awhile, he used for the most part such meats as expelled hunger and thirst. Forthe expelling of hunger, he made a composition of the seed poppy, sesame, andthe skin of the sea-onion—well-washed till it was quite drained of the outwardjuice; of the flowers of the daffadil, and the leaves of mallows, of barley andpea. Of all these, taking an equal weight, and chopping them small, he made upinto a mass with Hymettian honey. Against thirst, he took of the seeds ofcucumbers, and the fullest dried raisins (taking out the kernels), and theflower of coriander, and the seeds of mallows, and purselain, and scrapedcheese, meal and cream; these he mixed up with wild honey.885[endnote.xhtml#ftn885] This diet he said was taught to Hercules by Ceres when hewas sent into the Lybian deserts.886 [endnote.xhtml#ftn886]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THERAPEUTICThe Therapeutic part Pythagoras practiced by Poultices, Charms, and Music. ThePythagoreans (says Iamblichus) treated chiefly by poultices; but potions theyless esteemed. And of those they used only such as were proper againstulcerations; but incision, and cauterizing they absolutely disallowed.Magical Herbs, says Pliny, were first celebrated in our part of the world byPythagoras, following the Magi.887 [endnote.xhtml#ftn887] He first wrote atreatise on their virtues, assigning the invention and original to Apollo andAesculapius, Immortal gods.By Coriacesia and Callicia, says Pliny, Pythagoras affirms that water will beturned into ice. I find in others no more concerning this.888[endnote.xhtml#ftn888]He likewise speaks of Menais, which he also calls by another name “Corinthas.”The juice whereof boiled in water, he says, immediately cures the biting ofserpents when treating with moist heat the part therewith. The same juice beingspilt upon the grass, they who tread upon it, or are besprinkled therewith, dieirrecoverably: a strange nature of poison except against poison.889[endnote.xhtml#ftn889]There is an herb that Pythagoras called “Aproxis,” the root whereof takes fireat distance, as does naptha, of which says Pliny, we have spoken in the wondersof the Earth.890 [endnote.xhtml#ftn890] The same Pythagoras relates: that if anydisease shall happen to men when the Aproxis is in its flower, although they becured, yet shall they constantly have some grudging thereof as often as itblows; and wheat, and hemlock, and violet, have the same quality. “I am notignorant,” adds Pliny, “that this book is by some ascribed to Cleemporus, thephysician. But pertinacious fame and antiquity vindicate it to Pythagoras.”Pythagoras wrote also one volume concerning the sea onion, collecting themedicinal properties thereof, which Pliny professes to have taken from him.891[endnote.xhtml#ftn891] And again, Pliny says Pythagoras affirms that asea-onion, hung over the threshold of the gate, hinders all ill medicaments fromentering the house.Likewise, coleworts (as Pliny relates) were much commended by Pythagoras.892[endnote.xhtml#ftn892] He adds that concerning the white kind of the Eringo (bythe Romans called centum-capita), there are many vanities delivered, not only bythe Magi, but by the Pythagoreans.893 [endnote.xhtml#ftn893]Besides the Pharmaceutic, Pythagoras practiced two other ways of cure—one bymusic, the other by charm. Of the first we have already spoken. Of the second,Iamblichus relates that there is also a way, without the singing of birds, bywhich they expelled some passions, and sicknesses. As they say indeed byincantation. Whence it seems was derived the word images [images/266_0.png], theway of cure by charm—which was, says the Greek etymologist,894[endnote.xhtml#ftn894] of ancient use. Whence wrote Homer:—And staid the black blood by a Charm!895 [endnote.xhtml#ftn895]and Pindar, speaking of Aesculapius,images [images/266.jpg] [“tending them”] with soft charms.†That Pythagoras made use of poetic incantations is also affirmed by Porphyry. Heallayed, says he, the passions of the soul and body by rythms, verses, andincantations. And Diogenes, cited by Porphyry, said that if his friends fellinto any indisposition of body, he healed them; if they were troubled in mind,he assuaged their grief—partly by charms and magic verses, partly by music.896[endnote.xhtml#ftn896] For he had some verses proper to the cure of theindispositions of the body; by singing which he restored the sick to theirformer health. He had other verses that procured forgetfulness of grief,assuaged anger, and suppressed inordinate desires.Of these charms we find an instance preserved by Pliny, who describes it as aninvention of Pythagoras which seldom fails against lameness, or blindness, orthe like accidents. He prescribes that it be applied to the injured part: if onthe right side, an uneven number of vowels of impositive words; if on the left,an even.897 [endnote.xhtml#ftn897]"},{"pageContent":"Section III: SymbolsCHAPTER 1PYTHAGORAS: HIS SYMBOLIC WAY OF TEACHINGPythagoras had a two-fold manner of teaching: whatsoever he communicated to hisauditors was delivered either plainly or symbolically.898 [endnote.xhtml#ftn898]We have hitherto treated of the plain way. We come now to the other, thesymbolical.He used by short sentences to prophesy an infinite, multiplex signification tohis disciples after a symbolical manner.899 [endnote.xhtml#ftn899] No other thanApollo, by short answers, exhibits many imperceptible sentences. And natureherself, by small seeds most difficult, effects of this kind, such as thefollowing:—half is the whole's beginning.This is an Apothegm of Pythagoras himself. Neither in that short verse only, butin others of the same kind, the most divine Pythagoras wrapped up sparks oftruth for such as could enkindle them. He did so in a short way of speech,treasuring up concealed a most copious production of theory, such as this:—to number all have reference.And again images [images/267.png] Friendship, Equality; and in the word images[images/267_2.png] (World, or Heaven); and in the word Philosophy; and images[images/267_1.png] and in that renowned word Tetractys. All these, and manymore, did Pythagoras invent, for the benefit and rectification of such asconversed with him.Some things likewise (says Porphyry) he spoke in a mystical way, that issymbolically, most of which are collected by Aristotle.900[endnote.xhtml#ftn900] Such as when he called the Sea, a tear of Saturn;901[endnote.xhtml#ftn901] the two Bears, the hands of Rhea; the Pleiades, the lutesof the Muses; the Planets, the dogs of Proserpina;902 [endnote.xhtml#ftn902] theeyes, the gates of the Sun.903 [endnote.xhtml#ftn903]He made use of other symbols or aphorisms. For example: Go not over a balance;that is, shun avarice, etc. Thus Porphyry.904 [endnote.xhtml#ftn904] These arevariously recited and interpreted by several authors. We shall begin withIamblichus, as being herein of greatest credit.images [images/268.png]Iamblichus, the Neoplatonist renowned for his work on Pythagorean philosophy, issaid to have been the descendant of the priest-kings of Emesa.

Such are those they term symbols.As many as deserve commemoration, in our opinion, of the exhortatory form, weshall communicate and add a suitable interpretation. We conceive that hereby theexhortation to philosophy may be more prevalent on those that hear them, than ifdelivered more at large.And forasmuch as we shall insert some Exoteric solutions common to allphilosophy, it is to be understood as different from the meaning of thePythagoreans. But inasmuch as we shall intermix some of the most particularopinions of the Pythagoreans consonant to each, this is wholly proper to themand dissonant from all other philosophers, but most fit to be alleged. This willinsensibly lead us from the exoteric notions, bringing us to the others, andacquainting us with them. And to the exhortations framed according to this sectas a bridge or ladder by which we ascend from a depth to a great height, guidingthe minds of those who addict themselves genuinely thereto.For to this end it was framed, according to imitation of the things alreadymentioned. For the most ancient and such as were contemporary with and disciplesto Pythagoras did not compose their writings intelligible, in a common vulgarstyle, familiar to everyone, as if they endeavored to dictate things readilyperceptible by the hearer. But consonant to the silence decreed by Pythagorasconcerning divine mysteries, which it was not lawful to speak of before thosewho were not initiated. They therefore clouded both their mutual discourses andwritings by symbols; which—if not expounded by those that proposed them by aregular interpretation—appear to the hearers like old wives proverbs, trivialand foolish. But being rightly explained, and instead of dark, rendered lucidand conspicuous to the vulgar, they discover an admirable sense no less than thedivine oracle of Pythian Apollo, and give a divine inspiration to thephilologists that understand them.906 [endnote.xhtml#ftn906]That therefore their benefit may be known, and their exhortative use manifest,we will give the solutions of every symbol, both after the exoteric and by themethod of discourse, not omitting those things which were preserved in silence,not communicable to uninitiated persons. The Symbols are these: 1. When you go to the Temple, worship, neither do nor say anything concerning life. 2. If there be a Temple in your way, go not in; no not though you pass by the very doors. 3. Sacrifice and worship barefoot. 4. Concerning the gods, disbelieve nothing wonderful, nor concerning divine doctrines. 5. Decline highways, and take the foot-path! 6. Abstain from the Melanure, for it belongs to the Terrestrial gods. 7. Above all things, govern your tongue, when you follow the gods. 8. When the winds blow, worship the noise. 9. Cut not fire with a sword. 10. Turn away from the self every edge. 11. Help a man to take up a burden, but not to lay it down. 12. Put on the shoe first on the right foot, but the left foot first into the basin. 13. Discourse not of Pythagorean things without light. 14. Pass not over a pair of Scales. 15. Travelling from home, turn not back; for the Furies go back with you. 16. Pass not Urine, being turned towards the Sun. 17. Wipe not a seat with a torch. 18. A cock keep, but not sacrifice; for it is consecrated to the Moon and the Sun. 19. Sit not upon a Choenix. 20. Breed nothing that has crooked talons. 21. Cut not in the way. 22. Receive not a swallow into your house. 23. Wear not a ring. 24. Grave not the image of God on a ring. 25. Look not in a glass by candlelight. 26. Be not taken with immoderate laughter. 27. At a sacrifice, pare not your nails. 28. Lay not hold on everyone readily with your right hand. 29. When you rise out of bed, disorder the coverlet, and deface the print. 30. Eat not the heart. 31. Eat not the brains. 32. Spit upon the cuttings of your hair, and the parings of your nails. 33. Receive not an Erythrine. 34. Deface the print of a pot in the ashes. 35. Take not a woman that has gold, to get children of her. 36. First honor the figure and steps, a figure and a Triobolus. 37. Abstain from beans. 38. Set mallows, but eat it not. 39. Abstain from living creatures."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3AN EXPLICATION OF THE PYTHAGOREAN SYMBOLS BY IAMBLICHUSAll these symbols are in general exhortative to all virtue; and every one ofthem in particular conduces to some particular virtue, and part of philosophy,and learning; as the first are exhortative to devotion, and divine knowledge.SYMBOL IWhen you go to the temple, worship, neither do nor say anything concerning life.This exhortation observes the divinity after such manner, as it is initself—pure and unmixed. He joins pure to the pure, and takes care, that noworldly business insinuate itself into the divine worship. For they are thingswholly different and opposite to one another. Moreover, this conduces much toscience; for we ought not to bring to the divine science any such thing as humanconsideration, or care of outward life. Thus nothing is hereby commanded, butthat divine discourses, and sacred actions ought not to be intermixed with theinstable manners of men.SYMBOL IITo that is consonant the next symbol: If a temple lie in your way, go not in,not though you pass by the very doors. For if like is delightful to its like, itis manifest that the gods, having the chief essence of all things, ought to havethe principal worship. But if any man does it upon occasion of any other thing,he makes that the second which is the first and chief of all; and by that meanshe subverts the whole order of worship, and science. The most excellent goodought not to be ranked in the latter place as inferior to human good; neitherought our own affairs to have the place of the chief end and better thingseither in our words or thoughts.SYMBOL IIIThat which follows—Sacrifice and worship barefoot—is an exhortation to the same.For this signifies that we ought to serve the gods and perform their knowledgedecently and moderately, not exceeding the order in the earth. Another way thatwe ought to perform their service and knowledge is to be free and withoutfetters. This, the symbol commands to be observed not in the body only, but inthe acts of the soul. That such acts be not restrained by passions, nor by theinfirmity of the body, nor by our external generation, but all free and readyfor communication with the gods.SYMBOL IVThere is another symbol of this kind exhorting to the same virtue: Concerningthe gods, disbelieve nothing wonderful, nor concerning divine doctrines. Thisrule is religious, and declares the superlative excellence of the gods,instructing us and putting us in mind that we ought not to estimate the divinepower by our own Judgment. To us who are corporeal, and generated, andcorruptible, and transitory, and obnoxious to several diseases, and tonarrowness of habitation, and to aggravation of motion towards the center, andto sleepiness, and to indigence, and to abundance, and to imprudence, and toinfirmity, and to impediment of soul and the like—some things will seemdifficult, and impossible. Yet have we many excellencies by nature. But we arequite short of the gods. Neither have we the same power or ability. This symbol,therefore, chiefly advises to a knowledge of the gods, as of those who are ableto do all things; whence it admonishs to disbelieve nothing concerning the gods.There is added, nor concerning divine doctrines, meaning those which aredeclared by the Pythagorean philosophy. Because, they being settled bymathematics and scientific speculation, will show by demonstration, strengthenedby necessity, that there are true beings existent void of fallaciousness.These may also exhort to the science concerning the gods and persuade that sucha Science is to be acquired, as by which we shall not disbelieve907[endnote.xhtml#ftn907] anything concerning the gods. The same may advise todivine doctrines and to proceed by mathematics; for they only clear the eyes andare illuminative of all beings to him that will behold them. For byparticipation of mathematics, one thing is constituted before all: that wedisbelieve not anything, either concerning the nature of the gods, or theiressence, or their power. Nor of those Pythagorean doctrines which seem monstrousto persons not initiated into mathematics. Thus “disbelieve not” is equivalentto “acquire and possess those things by means whereof you shall notdisbelieve”—that is mathematics, and Scientific demonstrations.SYMBOL VThe next symbol tends (as I conceive) to the same effect: Declining highways,walk in pathways. For it commands to leave the public popular course of life andto pursue that which is separate and divine. Likewise, that we despise thecommon opinions, and much esteem the private which are not to be divulged. Andto condemn the pleasure which tends towards men; but to value exceedingly thatfelicity which is joined with the divine will. And to leave human customs asvulgar; but to apply ourselves to the worship of the Gods, which far excels theordinary course of life. Allied to this, is that which follows.SYMBOL VIAbstain from the Melanure, for it belongs to the Terrestrial Gods. We shall saymore upon this in our explication of the exhortative Symbols. It advises to makechoice of the Heavenly Journey and to adhere to the Intellectual Gods. Towithdraw ourselves from Material nature, and to direct our course to that lifewhich is pure, void of matter, and to make use of the best way of Divine worshipand that which is most suitable to the chief deities. These Symbols areexhortative to the knowledge and worship of the Gods.SYMBOL VIIThe following symbols exhort to Wisdom: Above all things govern your Tongue,following the Gods. For the first work of Wisdom is to revert our speech intoitself, and to accustom it not to pass forth, that it may be perfect withinourselves, and in its conversion towards ourselves. Moreover in following theGods: for nothing renders the mind so perfect as when a man, being reverted intohimself, follows the Gods.SYMBOL VIIIThis symbol likewise, When the winds blow, worship the noise, is an exhortationto Divine Wisdom. For it implies that we ought to love the similitude of DivineNatures, and Powers. And when they make a reason suitable to their efficacies,it ought exceedingly to be honored and reverenced.SYMBOL IXThe next symbol, Cut not fire with a sword, also exhorts to wisdom. For itexcites in us a convenient knowledge that we ought not to give sharp language toa man full of fire and anger, nor to contest with him. For you may often bywords exasperate and trouble a rude and unlearned person. Of this Heraclituswitnesses. To contest with anger (says he) is hard, for whatsoever it would havedone, it will purchase, though at the expense of life. And he said truly: formany gratifying their own anger have exchanged their Souls and preferred deathbefore them. But from continence of the tongue and peacefulness, this happens:that out of contention arises friendship, the wrathful fire being extinguished,and thou thyself wilt appear not to be void of reason. This symbol is confirmedby that which follows.SYMBOL XTurn away from thyself every edge; for towards whomsoever it shall be turned, itwill hurt him. This symbol commands to use prudence, not anger. For that edge ofthe mind which we call anger is void of reason and prudence. For anger boilslike a pot upon the fire, never dividing the mind to that which is past. Youmust therefore settle your mind in tranquility, diverting it from anger, anddiligently controlling yourself—as a man makes brass sound not without touchingit. This passion therefore must be suppressed by reason.SYMBOL XIThis symbol, Help to lay on a burden, but not to take it off, advises tofortitude. For whosoever lays on a burden, signifies labor and action; but hewho takes it off, rest and remissness. The meaning therefore of the Symbol isthis. Be not the cause, either to thyself or any other, of negligence of mindand soft life; for every useful thing is acquitted by labor. This SymbolPythagoras called Herculean, as being sealed by his labors. For while he livedamongst men, he passed frequently through fire and many difficulties, shunningidleness. From actions and labor proceed a right office, but not from sloth.SYMBOL XIIPluck off your right shoe first, but put your left foot first into the basinexhorts to active prudence. That good actions, as right, are to be set roundabout us; but the ill, as left, to be laid aside and rejected.SYMBOL XIIIDiscourse not of Pythagorean things without light is chiefly exhortatory thatthe mind acquire prudence. For that resembles the light of the mind which, beingindefinite, limits and reduces it, as it were, out of darkness into light. It istherefore chiefly requisite to look upon the mind as the guide of all goodactions in life. But in the Pythagorean doctrines this is most particularlynecessary. For it is not possible to understand what they are without light.SYMBOL XIVPass not over a balance, commands us to do justly. And above all things torespect equality and mediocrity. And to know justice, the most perfect Virtuewhich completes the rest, and without which the rest profit nothing. Neithermust we know it superficially only, but by Theorems and ScientificDemonstration. This knowledge is the work of no Art and Science, but only of thephilosophy of Pythagoras, which prefers Mathematics before all things else.SYMBOL XVTo the same purpose is this: Travelling from home, turn not back, for the furiesgo back with you. This Symbol exhorts to Philosophy and free action about themind. It likewise manifestly teaches thus. When you study philosophy, separatethyself from all corporeal and sensible things intelligible, which are alwaysthe same and after the same manner; proceeding (without turning back) byMathematics, conducing thereto. For as travel is the change of place, death isthe separation of the Soul from the Body. But we must so study philosophy as tomake use of the pure mind sincerely—without the acts of corporeal sense—to thecomprehension of the truth which is in things that are, which is acknowledged tobe wisdom. But after you have once applied yourself to study philosophy, turnnot back, nor be drawn back to the former corporeal things in which you werebred up. For you will much repent hereof, being hindered from sacredcomprehensions by the darkness which is in corporeal things. Repentance theycall Erinys, or Fury.SYMBOL XVIPass not Urine while being turned towards the Sun admonishes that we offer notto do any bestial action—but to study and practice philosophy, looking uponHeaven and the Sun. And remember that in the study of Philosophy, you never beara low mind; but by the contemplation of heavenly things, ascend to the gods andto wisdom. And having applied yourself to study philosophy and to the light oftruth that is in it—purifying yourself and converting yourself wholly to thatdesign: to Theology, and Physiology, and Astronomy, and Etiology which is aboveall the rest—do nothing irrational or bestial.SYMBOL XVIIThe same meaning is of the next: Wipe not a seat with a Torch. For not onlybecause a torch is purificative, as partaking of much quick fire like sulphur,it advises that this ought not to be defiled—its nature being such as it dispelsall things that defile. Nor ought we to oppose natural habitude by defiling thatwhose nature is repugnant to defiling. Much less ought we to join and mix thingsproper to wisdom with those which are proper to animality. For a torch inrespect of its brightness is compared to philosophy; a seat in respect of itslowness to animality.SYMBOL XVIIIThe symbol—Breed a Cock, but do not sacrifice it, for it is sacred to the Moonand the Sun—admonishes us to nourish and cherish (and not to neglect so as tosuffer them to perish and corrupt) the great evidences of the union, joiningtogether, sympathy and conspiration of the World. It therefore advises toaddress ourselves to contemplation of the Universe, and to philosophy. For thetruth of all things is by nature concealed, and hard to be found out, yetrequisite to be sought and investigated by man chiefly through philosophy (forto do it by any other study is impossible). Philosophy receiving some littlesparks from nature, blows them up and makes them greater and more perspicuous byits doctrines; it therefore ought to be studied.SYMBOL XIXThis, Sit not upon a Choenix, may appear to be more Pythagorean from what wasalready said. For because aliment is to be measured by corporeity and animality,not by the Choenix, rest not, nor lead thy life uninitiated into philosophy. Butapplying thyself thereto, take greatest care of that in thee which is mostDivine—the Soul. And the aliment of the Soul, chiefly the mind, is not measuredby the Choenix, but by contemplation and discipline.SYMBOL XXThis, Breed nothing that has crooked talons, advises to a thing which is yetmore Pythagorean. Be free and communicative, and endeavor to make others suchalso, accustoming thyself to give and receive without grudging or envy; not totake all things insatiably and to give nothing in return. For the naturalcondition of those Fowls which have crooked talons is to receive and snatchreadily and quickly, but not easily to let go or impart to others, by reason ofthe tenacity of their talons, being crooked. Such is also the nature of shrimps,that they quickly lay hold of a thing but very hardly part with it unless theybe turned upon their backs. Now we having hands given us by nature, proper tocommunicate, and straight not crooked fingers, ought not to imitate those whichhave crooked talons, unlike us. But rather mutually to communicate to andparticipate with one another, as being excited thereto by those who first gavenames to things; who named the more honorable hand images [images/278.png] theright, not only images [images/278_1.png] from receiving; but likewise, images[images/278_2.png] images [images/278_3.png] from being ready to receive incommunicating.† We must therefore do justly, and for that reason philosophize;for Justice is a return and remuneration, exchanging and supplying excess anddefect.SYMBOL XXIThis, Cut not in the way, expresses that truth is one, falsehood multiplex.Which is manifest from this—that what everything is, speaking plainly, isexpressed but one way; but what it is not, is expressed infinite ways.Philosophy seems to be a way. It therefore says, choose that philosophy and thatway to philosophy, in which thou shalt not cut (or divide) nor establishcontrary doctrines. But choose those which are constituted and confirmed byScientific demonstration, by Mathematics and contemplation—which is to say,philosophize in a Pythagorean manner.It may be taken also in another sense. Forasmuch as that philosophy whichproceeds by corporeals and sensibles (with which philosophy the younger sort aresatisfied, who conceive that God, and qualities, and the mind, and virtues—andin a word all the principal causes of things—are bodies) is easily subverted andconfuted; as appears by the great disagreement amongst them who go about to sayanything therein. But the philosophy which is of incorporeals, andintelligibles, and immaterials, and eternals—which are always the same inthemselves, and towards one another, never admitting corruption or alteration—isfirmly established and the cause of irrefragable demonstration. Now this preceptadvises us when we philosophize and perfect the way which is manifest, that weshun the snares and entertainments of corporeals and divisibles, and intimatelyapply ourselves to the substances of incorporeals—which are never unlikethemselves by reason of the truth and stability which they naturally have.SYMBOL XXIIThis, Receive not a Swallow into your house, advises that you admit not aslothful person (who is not a constant lover of labor, neither will persevere tobe a disciple) unto your doctrines—which require continual labor and patience byreason of the variety and intricateness of the several disciplines. He makes useof the swallow to represent sloth, and cutting off times, because this birdcomes to us but in one season of the year and then stays but a short while withus; but is absent from us and out of our sight a much longer space.SYMBOL XXIIIThis, Wear not a Ring, is likewise exhortatory after the Pythagorean way thus.Forasmuch as a ring encompasses the finger of the wearer in the nature of achain; but has this property—that it pinches not, nor pains, but is so fit as ifit naturally belonged to that part—and the body is such a kind of chain to thesoul. Wear not a ring signifies this: Philosophize truly, and separate your soulfrom the chain which goes round about it. For philosophy is the meditation ofdeath, and separation of the soul from the body. Seriously and earnestlytherefore apply yourself to the Pythagorean philosophy, which separates the soulby the mind from all corporeals, and is conversant about intellectuals andimmaterials by theoretical doctrines. But untie and loose your sins, and allthings that pluck you back and hinder philosophizing—diversions of the flesh,excessive eating, unreasonable repletion, which as it were, fetter the body, andcontinually breed infinite disease.SYMBOL XXIVThis, Grave not the image of God in a Ring, advises thus: Philosophize, andabove all things, think that the gods are incorporeal. This Symbol is beyond allothers the Seminary of the Pythagorean doctrines. Of it all things (almost) arefitly adapted, and by it are they established to the end. Think not that theyuse forms that are corporeal, neither that they are received into materialsubstance—fettered (as it were) to thy body—like other living beings. As we havesaid, the ring expresses a chain, and corporeity, and sensible form. The figuresengraved in rings, as it were the figure of some animal perceptible by sight,are those from which we must absolutely separate the gods. The gods beingeternal and intelligible and always the same in themselves and towards oneanother, as is largely discoursed in the treatise concerning God.SYMBOL XXVThis, Look not in a glass by candlelight, advises in a more Pythagorean mannerthe following. Philosophize, pursuing not the phantasies of sense (which give akind of light to comprehensions like a candle, neither natural nor true), butthose which procure Science and are conversant in the mind. Seek those by whicha most bright purity is constituted in the eye of the soul of all Notions andIntelligibles, and the speculation of them; but not of Corporeals and Sensibles.For such are in continual fluxion and mutation (as has often been shown). Theyare no way stable nor existing like themselves, whereby they might uphold a firmand Scientific comprehension as the others do.SYMBOL XXVIThis, Be not seized with immoderate laughter, shows that we should vanquishpassion. Put thyself in mind of right reason; be neither blown up in goodfortune, not cast down in bad; admitting no thought of change in either. Henamed laughter above all other passions, because that is most apparently shownin the face itself. Perhaps also because this is proper to man only of allliving creatures; whence some define man as a risible living creature. Thisprecept shows that we ought to take humanity only, as it were in our way, likeguests. But to acquire the imitation of God, as far as we are able byPhilosophising, secretly withdrawing ourselves from the property of men, andpreferring the rational before the risible in distinction from other creatures.SYMBOL XXVIIThis, At a Sacrifice pare not your nails, is exhortative to friendship. For ofdomestics and allies, some being nearly related to us (such as brothers,children, parents) are like our limbs and parts which cannot be taken awaywithout much pain and maim. Others who are allied to us at a great distance (asthe children of uncles, or of cousins, or their children, or such like) resemblethose parts which may be cut off without pain (as hair, nails, and the like).Intending therefore to signify those allies, whom by reason of this distance weat other times neglect, he uses the word “nails,” saying, “Cast not those quiteaway.” But in Sacrifices—though at other times neglected—carry them along withyou and renew your domestic familiarity with them.SYMBOL XXVIIIThis, Lay not hold on everyone readily with your right hand, means: Give notyour right hand easily. That is, draw not to you, nor endeavor to draw out,improper and uninitiated persons by giving them your right hand. Moreover, tosuch as have not been long tried by disciplines and doctrines, nor are approvedas worthy to participate of temperance and of the quinquennial silence, andother trials, the right hand ought not to be given.SYMBOL XXIXThis, When you rise out of bed, wrap the coverlets together and confound theprint of your body, advises that having undertaken to philosophize, you shouldacquaint yourself with Intellectuals and Incorporeals. Therefore as soon as yourise from the sleep of ignorance and that darkness which resembles night; drawnot to yourself any corporeal thing to the light of philosophy—which resemblesthe day. But blot out of your remembrance all prints of that sleep.SYMBOL XXXThis, Eat not the heart, signifies that we ought not to tear asunder the unityand conspiration of the whole. Moreover it implies, Be not envious, butobliging, and communicative. Hereupon it exhorted to philosophy. For of all Artsand Sciences, only philosophy envies not the good of others, nor grievesthereat, nor rejoices in the ill of a neighbor. But it declares that all men areby nature allied to one another, and friends, and alike affected, and subjectedalike to fortune, and alike ignorant of the future; and therefore commands themto commiserate and love one another as becomes a creature sociable and rational.SYMBOL XXXILike that is this, Eat not the Brain, for this is the principal instrument ofWisdom. It signifies therefore that we ought not with reproaches to bite andtear in pieces things well intended and doctrines. Those are well intended whichare exactly considered by the principal reason of mind, like to thingscomprehended by Science. For these are beheld not by the organs of theirrational soul—that is, by the heart and the liver—but by the pure rationalpart of the soul. Wherefore it is a folly to oppose them. This Symbol ratheradvises to worship the fountain of Minds, and next instrument of Intellection,by whose means we acquire Speculation and Science, and (in a word) all Wisdom,and truly philosophize; and not to confound and deface the prints that aretherein.SYMBOL XXXIIThis, Spit upon the cutting of thy Hair and parings of they Nails, says thus.Those things are easily condemned which are born with thee, but are more distantfrom the Mind. As on the other side, those are more esteemed which are nearer tothe mind. So having addicted thy mind to philosophy above all, reverence thosethings which are demonstrated by the soul and mind without the organs of senseby speculative Science. But condemn and spit upon those things which are seenwithout the light of the mind by the sensitive organs which are born withus—which are not capable of reaching the eternity of the mind.SYMBOL XXXIIIThis, Receive not an Erythrine, seems to respect the etymology of the word.Entertain not an impudent blushless person, nor on the other side oneover-bashful, ready to fall back from the mind and firm intellection. Whence isunderstood also, Be not such yourself.SYMBOL XXXIVThis, Deface the print of a pot in the ashes, signifies that he who applies hismind to philosophy, must forget the demonstrations of confusion and grossness(that is of corporeals and sensibles) and wholly make use of demonstrations ofIntelligibles. By ashes are meant the dust or sand in Mathematical tableswherein the demonstrations and figures are drawn.SYMBOL XXXVApproach not her to get Children who has money, is not meant of a woman but of aSect and philosophy which has in it much corporeity and gravity tendingdownwards. For of all things in the Earth, Gold is the most heavy and aptest tomove towards the center which is the property of corporeal weight. To approachmeans not only coition, but to apply ourselves and to be assistant.SYMBOL XXXVIThis, In the first place honor the figure and the degrees, the figure and theTriobolus; advises to philosophize, and study Mathematics not superficially; andby them as by degrees of ascension, arrive at our proposed end; but despisethose things which others prefer before these. And chiefly reverence the Italicphilosophy which considers Incorporeals in themselves, before the Ionic whichfirst looks upon bodies.SYMBOL XXXVIIThis, Abstain from Beans, advises to beware of everything that may corrupt ourdiscourse with the gods and prescience.SYMBOL XXXVIIIThis, Plant Mallows but eat it not, signifies that such things are turned withthe Sun. “Plant,” that is, insisting on its nature and application to the Sunand Sympathy, neither abstain from it, nor wholly adhere to it. But transferyour mind and intellect, and transplant them, as it were, to plants and herbs ofthe same kind; and to animals which are not of the same kind; and to stones andrivers; and in a word to all natures. For thou wilt find that which designs theunity and conspiration of the World to be fruitful and full of variety andadmirably copious, as if it sprung from a mallow root. Therefore not only eatnot, nor deface such observations, but on the contrary increase them, andmultiply them, as it were by transplantation.SYMBOL XXXIXThis, Abstain from living Creatures, exhorts to Justice and respect of allianceby a like kind of life and the like.By these is explained the Symbolical exhortative form—containing much that iscommon with the customs of the Ancients, and the Pythagoreans. Thus Iamblichus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE SAME SYMBOLS EXPLAINED BY OTHERSMost of these Symbols are mentioned also by others, with different explications.The first, Olympiodorus ascribed to Philolaus, delivering it thus: When you comeinto a Temple, turn not back.908 [endnote.xhtml#ftn908] Iamblichus, in the lifeof Pythagoras, cites it in the same words, adding this exposition: “That weought not to perform divine rites, cursorily and negligently.”Upon the second, Adore not the gods, as it were, in passing by, Plutarch says weought to go from home with that express intent.909 [endnote.xhtml#ftn909] Andfor this reason the cryers used upon Festival days to go before the Priests, andcommanded the people to forbear working.The same exposition Iamblichus, in the life of Pythagoras gives of the third,Sacrifice and go to sacred rites barefoot.To the fourth, Concerning the gods, disbelieve nothing wonderful, and concerningdivine Doctrines, may be applied to what Iamblichus says in the life ofPythagoras. Many precepts were introduced into the practice of divine rites,forasmuch as they gave firm credit to these things, conceiving them not to befantastic boasts, but to derive their beginning from some god.910[endnote.xhtml#ftn910] All this the Pythagoreans believe to be true—as thefabulous reports concerning Aristaeus the Proconnesian, and Abaris theHyperborean, and the like. And they did not only believe all these, but alsoendeavored themselves to frame many things that seem fabulous, derogating fromnothing which relates to the Deity. In all such things he conceived not that thepersons themselves were foolish, but those only who gave no belief to it. Forthey are not of opinion that the gods can do some things, others they cannot, asthe Sophists imagine; but, that all things are possible. And the same is thebeginning of the verses which they ascribe to Linus, but perhaps were made byPythagoras.Hope all things, for to none belongs despair;All things to God easy and perfect are.The fifth, Decline highways, is mentioned by many. Only Laertius delivers itquite otherwise: Go not out of the highway. But in the exposition differs notfrom the rest. That we ought not to follow the opinions of the vulgar, which arewithout judgment, and not indisputable; but those of the few and learned.The sixth, Abstain from the Melanure, for it belongs to the Terrestrial gods,Plutarch interprets, as forbidding to converse with persons black in impiety.911 [endnote.xhtml#ftn911] Tryphon, as forbidding falsehood and lies which areblack in their essence. The Melanure is a kind of fish so named from theblackness of its tail.The ninth, Cut not fire with a sword, is one of those Symbols which are ascribedto Andocides the Pythagorean. Porphyry,912 [endnote.xhtml#ftn912] Plutarch,913[endnote.xhtml#ftn913] Laertius,914 [endnote.xhtml#ftn914] and Athenaeus,915[endnote.xhtml#ftn915] interpret it as advising not to exasperate an angryperson, but to give way to him. Fire is anger, the sword, contention. St. Basilexpounds it of those who attempt an impossibility.The tenth, Laertius reads thus, Turn away a sharp sword. It is generallyexpounded, Decline all things dangerous.The eleventh, Help to lay on a burden, but not to take it off, is expounded byPorphyry that we ought to further others, not in sluggishness, but in virtue andlabor. Or as Iamblichus, that we ought not to be the cause of another's beingidle. Laertius and Olympiodorus cite it thus: Lay not burdens down together, buttake them up together; expounding it that we must work together in the course oflife, and co-operate with others in actions, tending not to idleness but tovirtue.The twelfth which is cited by Suidas out of Aristophanes, in verse, thus:Into the shoe first the right foot,The left first in the basin put.He expounds it not as a Symbol, but a Proverb of those who perform thingsdexterously.The fourteenth, Pass not over a balance, is generally interpreted byPlutarch,916 [endnote.xhtml#ftn916] Laertius,917 [endnote.xhtml#ftn917] Clementof Alexandria,918 [endnote.xhtml#ftn918] Porphyry,919 [endnote.xhtml#ftn919] andothers that we ought to esteem Justice, and not to exceed it. Athenaeus andPorphyry expound it as counseling against avarice, and advising to pursueequality.The fifteenth, Laertius delivers thus: When you go to travel, look not back uponthe bounds.920 [endnote.xhtml#ftn920] Plutarch thus, When you come to theborders, return not back. They both interpret it that when we are dying, andarrived at the bound or end of our life, we should bear it with an equalmind—without grief, nor to desire a continuance of the pleasures of this life.So also Porphyry.The seventeenth Laertius reads thus, Wipe not a seat with Oil.The eighteenth, Laertius and Suidas deliver thus: Touch not a white Cock, for itis sacred to the Moon, and a monitor of the hours.The nineteenth, Sit not upon a Choenix, Plutarch and Porphyry interpret, that weought not to live idly, but to provide necessaries for the future. For aChoenix, according to Laertius and Suidas, is the same which Clearchus calls“Hemorotrophen,” a proportion of food daily spent. But Clement of Alexandriainterprets it as advising to consider not the present day, but what the futurewill bring forth. To be solicitous, not of food, but prepared for death.The twentieth, Breed nothing that has crooked talons, is ascribed to Andocydesthe Pythagorean.The twenty-first, Olympiodorus delivers thus: Cleave not wood in the way.Whereby, says he, the Pythagoreans advised not to disquiet life with excessivecares and vain solicitude.The twenty-second is Entertain not a swallow under your roof. Plutarchinterprets this as take not unto you an ungrateful and unconstant friend andcompanion. For only this bird, of all the lesser kind, is reported to prey uponflesh. 921 [endnote.xhtml#ftn921] Clement of Alexandria and Porphyrius interpretit as forbidding to admit into our society a talkative person, intemperate ofspeech, who cannot contain what is communicated to him. 922[endnote.xhtml#ftn922]The twenty-third, Plutarch alleged thus, Wear not a straight Ring. That is, sayshe, Follow a free course of life and fetter not yourself.923[endnote.xhtml#ftn923] Or, as St. Hierom, That we live not anxiously, nor putourselves into servitude, or into such a condition of life as we cannot freeourselves from when we should have a mind to do it.The twenty-fourth, Wear not the picture of the gods in Rings, Porphyry expounds:Discourse not of the gods inconsiderately or in public. 924[endnote.xhtml#ftn924] Iamblichus, in the life of Pythagoras, delivers it thus:Wear not the image of God in a Ring lest it be defiled; for it is the image ofGod.925 [endnote.xhtml#ftn925] Clement of Alexandria affirms the meaning to bethat we ought not to mind Sensibles but to pass on to Intelligibles.926[endnote.xhtml#ftn926]In the twenty-eighth, Lay not hold on everyone readily with your right hand,Plutarch omits images [images/288.png], Suidus images [images/288_1.png] It isgenerally expounded thus, Be not hasty and precipitate in contracting friendshipwith any.The twenty-ninth, When you rise out of bed, wrap the coverlet together, andconfound the print of your body, Plutarch refers to the modesty and respect dueto the bed. Clement of Alexandria says it signifies that we ought not in thedaytime to call to mind any pleasures, even of dreams, which we had in thenight.927 [endnote.xhtml#ftn927] Perhaps also, says he, it means, that we oughtto confound dark phantasie with the light of truth.The thirtieth and thirty-first, Eat not the Heart and the Brains, Iamblichus, inthe life of Pythagoras, says he enjoined forasmuch as these two are the seats oflife and knowledge.928 [endnote.xhtml#ftn928] Porphyry to the first, andPlutarch to the second, give one interpretation: Consume not yourself with griefnor afflict your mind with cares.The thirty-second, Laertius delivers contrary to Iamblichus: Upon the paring ofyour nails or cuttings of your hair, neither pass urine nor tread.The thirty-fourth, Deface the print of a pot in the ashes, Plutarch and Clementof Alexandria expound as advising that upon reconcilement of enmity, we utterlyabolish and leave not the least print or remembrance of anger.The thirty-sixth, Honor the figure and the three oboli, seems to have referenceto the story related in the sixth chapter of his life.Of the thirty-seventh, Abstain from Beans, there are alleged many differentreasons.929 [endnote.xhtml#ftn929] Aristotle says he forbade them for that theyresemble images [images/289.png] [“the genitals”], or the gates of the InfernalRegion; or for that they breed worms (a little sort of maggot called “Midae”);or for that they resemble the nature of the Universe; or for that they areoligarchic, being used in suffrages. This last reason is confirmed by Plutarch,who explains this Symbol: Abstain from suffrages; which of old were given bybeans.†930 [endnote.xhtml#ftn930]Porphyry says He interdicted beans because the first beginning and generationbeing confused, and many things being commixed and growing by assimilationtogether, and putrifying in the earth by little and little, the generation anddiscretion broke forth together; and living creatures being produced togetherwith plants, then out of the same putrefaction arose both men and beans; whereofhe alleged manifest arguments. For, if anyone should chew a bean, and, havingminced it small with his teeth, lay it abroad in the warm Sun, and so leaving itfor a little time return to it, he shall perceive the scent of human blood.Moreover, if anyone at the time when beans shoot forth the flower, shall take alittle of the flower which then is black, and put it into an earthen vessel, andcover it close, and bury it in the ground ninety days, and at the end thereoftake it up and take off the cover—instead of the bean, he shall find either thehead of an Infant or or images [images/290.png] [“the vagina of a woman”].931[endnote.xhtml#ftn931] The same reason Origen ascribes to Zaratus, from whomperhaps Pythagoras, being his student, received them.932 [endnote.xhtml#ftn932]Hence it is that Pliny says he condemned beans, because the souls of dead are inthem. And Porphyry elsewhere, because they most partake of the nature of aliving creature. Some, including Cicero, say it was because beans disturb thetranquility of mind. Wherefore to abstain from them, says Porphyry, makes ourdreams serene and untroubled. Aulus Gellius says he meant, from venerealdelights.933 [endnote.xhtml#ftn933] And Plutarch says he forbade beans becausethey conduce thereto. On the contrary, Clement of Alexandria affirms they wereprohibited out of no other reason than that women feeding on them becamebarren.934 [endnote.xhtml#ftn934]For the thirty-ninth, Abstain from the flesh of living creatures, the mostgeneral reason is because they are of the same nature and temperament with us,and in a manner, allied unto us. But of this we spoke formerly."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5OTHER SYMBOLSTo the foregoing Symbols collected by Iamblichus, may be added these:Take not up what falls from the Table. Meaning that men should not accustomthemselves to eat intemperately. Or alluding to some religious rite. ForAristophanes says that which falls so belongs to the Heroes, saying in hisHeroes:Taste not what from the Table falls.935 [endnote.xhtml#ftn935]Break not Bread. Divide not friends. Others refer it to the judgment in theInfernal places. Others, that it implies fear in War.936 [endnote.xhtml#ftn936]Set down Salt. This is in remembrance of Justice. For Salt preserves all things,and is brought out of the purest thing, Water.937 [endnote.xhtml#ftn937]Pluck not a Crown. That is offend not the Laws, for Laws are the crown ofCities.938 [endnote.xhtml#ftn938]Offer libation to the gods just to the ears of the cup. This signifies that weought to worship and celebrate the gods with Music, for that passes in at theears.939 [endnote.xhtml#ftn939] And drink not of that libation.940[endnote.xhtml#ftn940]Eat not (which are unlawful) generation, augmentation, beginning, end, nor thatof which the first basis of all things consists. Meaning, we must abstain fromthe loins, images [images/291.png] [“testicles (and) genitals”]† marrow, feet,and head of victims.

If he meets with a guide that leads to the better—that is, if he learnPhilosophy, Oratory, or some honest art which may prove beneficial, but cannotbe attained without much labor—they affirm that he shall lead an honorable andplentiful life. But if not lighting upon such a Master, he takes the left handway which seems at first to be the better and to lead to virtue—that is if hegives himself over to sloth and luxury, which seem pleasant at first to him whois ignorant of true good—he shall e're long lose both his credit and estate, andlive thence forward, ignominiously, and miserably. Thus Lactantius, perhapsalluding to the old verses.960 [endnote.xhtml#ftn960]images [images/294.png]The Pythagorean Y From Geoffroy Tory, Champfleury, 1529The Pythagorean Letter two ways spread,Shows the two paths in which Man's life is led.The right hand track to sacred Virtue tends,Though steep and rough at first, in rest it ends;The other broad and smooth, but from its Crown,On rocks the Traveller is tumbled down.He who to Virtue by harsh toils aspires,Subduing pains, worth and renown acquires:But who seeks slothful luxury, and flys,The labour of great acts, dishonour'd dies!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE GOLDEN VERSES OF PYTHAGORASA Summary of the Pythagorean Doctrine is extant in verse entitled The GoldenVerses of Pythagoras; or as others, of the Pythagoreans. For, says Hierocles, asGold is the best and purest of Metals, so these are the best and most Divine ofverses. They are these:First, in their ranks, th' Immortal Gods adore,Thy Oath keep; next, great Heroes; then implore,Terrestrial Daemons with due sacrifice.Thy Parents reverence, and near Allies:Him that is first in Virtue make thy Friend,And with observance his kind speech attend:Nor (to thy power) for Light faults cast him by,Thy pow'r is neighbour to Necessity.These know, and with intentive care pursue;But anger, sloth, and luxury subdue.In sight of others or thyself forbearWhat's ill; but of thyself stand most in fear.Let Justice all thy words and actions sway;Nor from the even course of Reason stray:For know that all men are to die ordain'd,And riches are as quickly lost as gain'd.Crosses that happen by divine decree,(If such thy lot) bear not impatiently.Yet seek to remedy with all thy care,And think the Just have not the greatest share.'Mongst men, discourses good and bad are spread,Despise not those, nor be by these misled.If any some notorious falsehood say,Thou the report with equal Judgment weigh.Let not men's smoother promises invite,Nor rougher threats from just resolves thee fright.If ought thou wouldst attempt, first ponder it;Fools only inconsiderate acts commit.Nor do what afterwards thou may repent;First learn to know the thing on which th' art bent.Thus thou a life shalt lead with joy repeat.Nor must thou care of outward health forget.Such temp'rance use in exercise and diet,As may preserve thee in a setled quiet.Meats unprohibited, not curious chose,Decline what any other may accuse.The rash expence of vanity detest,And sordidness: A mean in all is best.Hurt not thyself: Before thou act, advise;Nor suffer sleep at night to close thine eyes,Till thrice thy acts that day thou hast ore-run,How slipped? what deeds? what duty left undone?Thus thy account summ'd up from first to last,Grieve for the ill, joy for what good has past.These study, practise these, and these affect;To sacred virtue these thy steps direct.Eternal Nature's fountain I attest,Who the Tetractys on our soul imprest.Before thy mind thou to this study bend,Invoke the Gods to grant it a good end.These if thy labour vanquish, thou shalt thenKnow the connection both of Gods and men;How everything proceeds, or by what staid,And know (as far as fit to be survey'd)Nature alike throughout: that thou mayest learnNot to hope hopeless things, but all discern.And know those Wretches whose perverser willsDrawn down upon their head spontaneous Ills;Unto the good that's nigh them deaf and blind:Some few the cure of these misfortunes find.This only is the Fate that harms, and rolls,Through miseries successive, human souls.Within is a continual hidden fight,Which we to shun must study, not excite.Great Jove? how little trouble should we know,If thou to all men wouldst their Genius show?But fear not thou. Men come of heav'nly race,Taught by diviner Nature what t' embrace:Which if pursu'd, thou all I named shalt gain,And keep thy Soul clear from thy body's stain.In time of Prayer and cleansing, meats deniedAbstained from; thy mind's reign let reason guide.Then strip'd of flesh up to free Aether soar,A deathless God, Divine, mortal no more."},{"pageContent":"Part FourPythagorean CommentatorsTimaeus the LocreanJohn Reuchlin images [images/fig.png]The supreme Greek god Zeus is honored on this silver stater of Locri Epizephyrii(‘of the western wind’), struck c.400-350 B.C., with his portrait on the obverseand his animal familiar, the eagle, shown devouring its prey on the reverse.Photo courtesy of Classical Numismatic Group, Inc."},{"pageContent":"Timaeus the LocrianOF THE SOUL OF THE WORLD, AND OF NATURETimaeus, the Locrian, in his Principles, said these things. There are twoprinciples of all things: the Mind, of things effected according to reason;Necessity, of those which are by violence according to the powers of bodies. Ofthese one is of the nature of good, and is called God, and is the principle ofthe best things. The consequent and concausals are reduced to Necessity. For allthings are the offspring of these: Idea, Matter, Sensibles. The Idea isungenerated, immovable, permanent, of the nature of Identity, intellectual, theexemplar of things that are made, and immutable. Matter is the print, mother,nurse, and productrix of the third essence. For, receiving likeness into itself,and being, as it were, characterised by them, it perfects all productions. Thismatter he asserted to be eternal, but not immovable, in form of itself andwithout figure, but receiving all forms. In bodies it is divisible and of thenature of Otherness. They call Matter, “Place” and “Region.” These twoprinciples are contrary. Form, has the nature of male and father; Matter, offemale and mother; the Third (Sensibles) is their offspring.These being three are known three ways: Idea, by intellect, according toscience; Matter, by spurious ratiocination, not being understood by directcomprehension but by analogy; their Offspring, by sense and opinion. BeforeHeaven was made, we must conceive that there was Idea, and Matter, and God, themaker of the better (viz. Idea). Now forasmuch as the elder is better than theyounger, and the orderly than the disorderly—God, being good, and seeing Matterreceive Idea and become totally changed, yet disorderly, saw also it was needfulto bring it into order; and from indefinite transmutations to fix itdeterminately, that bodies might have proportionate distinctions and not receivepromiscuous variations.Of all this Matter he framed the World (making it the bound of the nature ofBeing since it comprehends all other things). He made it one, only begotten,perfect, animate, and rational (for these are better than inanimate andirrational), and a spherical body (that being more perfect than other figures).Designing therefore to make the best production, he made this God, generate, notcorruptible by any other cause but by the same God only which composed it, if itshould please him at any time to dissolve it. But he who is good, will not becarried on to the destruction of the fairest production. Wherefore it ispermanent, and being such, incorruptible, imperishable, and blessed. It is thebest of productions, being made by the best cause; who looked not upon patternsmade by hands, but upon the Idea, the intellectual essence. After which, thisbeing exactly made, is the fairest of all and not to be demolished.It is perfect, as to sensible things, for the exemplar comprehending in itselfall intelligible creatures, left nothing out. It being the perfect bound ofIntelligibles, as the World is of sensibles; which being solid, tactile, andvisible, is divided into Earth, Fire, and (between these) Air, and Water. Itconsists of perfect bodies which exist entirely in it, so as no part remainsbeyond it, that the body of the Universe might be self-sufficient, and notliable to dissolution by any external accidents. For there are no other thingsbesides these and what are contained in them—they being, after the mostexcellent analogy, connected in equal power, neither predominating over theother in any part, nor being predominated, that whereby some might increase,others decrease. But it rests in an indissoluble harmonious concord, accordingto the best proportion.For there being three bounds, and the intervals distant from each other in thesame proportion. The middle is that to the first which the third is to it, andso reciprocally, according to disposition of place and order. But to numberthese, without the help of another thing equal to them, is absolutelyimpossible. It is well ordered both for figure and motion. As to the first,being round, it is every way like itself, and able to contain all other figures.As to its circular motion, it keeps a perpetual tenor. For a Sphere only,whether in rest or in motion, is so adapted to the same place as that it neverceases nor removes—all its parts being equidistant from the Center. Now itsoutward superficies being exactly smooth, it needs not the weak organs which arebestowed on other living creatures for their accommodation.The Soul of the World God inkindled in the midst, but diffused beyond it,covering the Universe with it and tempering it with a temperament of indivisibleForm and divisible Substance, so as these two make one temperament. With this hemingled two powers, principles of the two motions of Identity and Otherness;which (Soul), not easily capable of being mixed, was not without difficultyblended together.All these proportions are mixed according to harmonious numbers, whichproportions he cunningly divided, that it might be known of what and by what theSoul consists. This Soul God did not ordain (as we affirm) after corporealsubstance (for that which is most honorable is first both in power and time).But He made it before the body, removing one, the first of four Monads, intoeight Decads and three Centuries. Of this, the duple and triple is easilycollected, the first being settled. All these, with their complements, andsesquioctaves, will amount to thirty-six. The whole sum will be 114,695. Thedivisions are 114,695. After this manner he divided the Soul of the Universe.The Mind only sees the Eternal God, the Ruler and Father of all things.961[endnote.xhtml#ftn961] That which is generated we behold with our eyes—thisWorld and its parts. The Aetherial are twofold: some of the nature of Identity,others of Difference. Of these, some extrinsically carry about all that iswithin them from East to West by an universal motion. The rest, being of themotion of Diversity, intrinsically turn about from the West to the East, movedby themselves. They are carried round by accident, with the motion of Identity,having the greatest force in the World.The motion of Diversity, divided according to harmonious proportions, isdisposed into seven circles. The Moon being nearest the Earth, performs hercourse in a month. Next her, the Sun perfects his course in a year. There aretwo of equal course with the Sun—Mercury, and the Star Juno, which many callVenus, and Lucifer. (All persons not being skillful in the rules of sacredAstronomy and the observations of rising and setting). The same star issometimes Hesper, when it so follows the Sun, that it is conspicuous to us whenthe Sun is set; sometimes Eous, when it go before the Sun, and rises before him.Lucifer, therefore, many times is the star Venus when she runs along with theSun. And likewise are many of the Fixed Stars and planets. For any star ofvisible magnitude, ushering the Sun above the Horizon, foretells day. The otherthree, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have peculiar velocities and unequal years.But they complete their course in certain and comprehensible regularities, andappearances, and occultations, and eclipses, and risings, and settings. Theyhave, besides their phases, rising and setting in regard of the Sun.The Sun makes day in performing his course from East to West; night, by motionfrom West to East; while he is carried about with the motion of Identity, ayear, by his own proper motion. By these two motions the Sun performs a doublecourse: one as being carried about with the general motion of Heaven, the otherby an oblique motion. One distinguishes the times of the day and the seasons.The other, by which he is carried about after the rapid motion of the FixedStars, at every revolution makes night day. These are parts of time calledPeriods, ordained by God together with the World. For before the World therewere no Stars, and consequently neither year nor seasons, by which thisgenerable World is commensurated. This time is the image of that which isinnate, called Eternity. For as this Universe was formed after the eternalexemplar of the Ideal World, so was this time ordained together with the Worldafter its pattern, Eternity.The Earth being established in the midst, the seat of the gods is the bound ofnight and day, of rising and setting, according to the section of Horizons, asthey are circumscribed by the sight and by section of the Earth. It is the mostancient of all bodies in the Universe. For Water was not produced without Earth;nor Air without humidity; and Fire cannot subsist without humidity and matterwhich it kindles. So that the Earth is settled upon its own weight as the rootand basis of all things.The principle therefore of generated things, as to the subject, is Matter; as tothe form, Idea. The productions of these are bodies—Earth, Water, Air, andFire—whose generation is thus. Every body consists of superficies; a superficiesof Triangles; of which this is a rectangled equal-legged semiquadrangle; theother unequilateral, having the greater angle in power, triple to the lesser.The least angle in it is one-third of a right angle. Double to this is themiddle angle, consisting of two-thirds. The greatest is a right angle,sesquialter to the middle, triple to the least. Now this Triangle is asesquiquadrangle to an equilateral Triangle, the perpendicular from the top tothe bottom being divided into two equal parts. There are therefore in each tworectangled Triangles. But in one the two sides which include the right angle areequal; in the other, all the three sides are unequal. This figure is called“Scholion.” This semiquadrangle is the principle of which the earth wasconstituted; for the Quadrangle is compounded of these four semiquadrangles.Of the Quadrangle is generated the Cube, the firmest and most settled of allbodies, having six sides, eight angles. For this reason Earth is the most heavybody, and unapt for motion, and not transmutable into any other, as beingincommunicable with any kind of Triangle. For the Earth only has a stableprinciple, which is the semi-quadrangle, the element of the other bodies—Fire,Air, and Water. For the semiquadrangle being six times compounded, there arisesan equilateral Triangle, of which a Pyramid with four bases and four equalangles is compounded, the form of fire most apt to motion and of rarest parts.Next these is the Octahedron with eight bases and six angles, the element ofAir. The third, Icosahedron, of twenty bases, and twelve angles is the elementof Water, being fullest of parts, and heaviest. These being compounded of thesame Element are transmutated into one another.The Dodecahedron, he made the image of the Universe, as nearest to a Globe. Fireby reason of the rarity of its parts penetrates all things; Air all things butFire; Water, all but Earth.All things therefore are full, and admit no vacuity. They are carried about bythe circumvolution of the Universe; and, by reason of their solidity, grate oneupon another, rendering an unintermitted alteration to generation andcorruption. These God used in framing the World—tactile by reason of Earth,visible by reason of Fire—the two extremes. By Air and Water, he connected it ina most firm band, proportion, capable to contain both itself and the things thatare comprised in it. If then that which is connected be a superficies, onemedium is sufficient; if a solid, it requires two. To the two mediums, headapted the two extremes—Fire to Air, Air to Water, Water to Earth; and againFire to Air, Air to Water, and Water to Earth; and again as Earth to Water,Water to Air, and Air to Earth; and reciprocally as Earth to Air, Water to Fire.And forasmuch as all these are equal in power, their proportions are equallikewise.Thus is the World one, and by a happy connection, proportionable. Each of thesefour bodies has diverse species. The Fire is flame, light, splendor, by reasonof the inequality of the Triangles in each of these. The Air is partly clear anddry, partly humid and cloudy. The Water is fluid and concrete, as snow, frost,hail, and ice. Of Humid, one sort is fluid as honey and oil; another compact, aspitch and wax. Of the compact are two kinds: one fusile, as gold, silver, brass,tin, lead; the other frangible, as sulphur, bitumen, nitre, salt, alum, andstones of that kind.After he had made the World, he proceeded to the production of mortal creaturesthat it might be perfect and completely wrought according to its pattern.962[endnote.xhtml#ftn962] Having blended together and distributed the Soul of Manby the same proportions and powers, he delivered it over to that nature whichhad the power of changing. She succeeding him in the producing of mortaltransitory creatures and instilled their souls: some from the Moon, some fromthe Sun, some from the other Stars which wander in the Region of Otherness.Excepting one soul in the power of Identity which he mingled in the rationalpart, an image of wisdom to those who make use of good Fate. For of the humansoul, one part is rational and intellectual, the other irrational and foolish.Of the irrational, the better is of the nature of Identity, the worse that ofDiversity. Each of these is resident about the head, that all the other parts ofthe soul and body may be subservient to it according to the analogy of the bodyof the Universe. Of the irrational part: one is irascible placed about theheart; the other desiderative about the liver.As for the body, the principle and root of marrow is in the brain, wherein isthe hegemonic of the Soul. From the brain issues an emanation flowing down alongthe vertebra of the spine from whence it is distributed into seed and generativesubstance. The bones are the case of the marrow; the flesh is the covering ofthe bones; the joints he connected by nerves for motion. Of the inward parts,some were made for nourishment, others for conversation. Of the motions, thosewhich come from without and flow into the apprehensive part are sensible; thosewhich fall not under comprehension are insensible, whether by reason that theaffected bodies are more earthy, or that the motions are weaker. Whatsoevermotions change nature are painful; those that comply with her are namedpleasures.Of the senses, God enlightned our Sight for contemplation of Celestials andapprehension of Science. Hearing, he framed perceptive of Discourse and ofMusic. Of this sense, if any be destitute from his birth, he will also beincapable of Speaking. Whence we say Hearing is nearest allied to Reason. Allthat are termed affections of bodies are denominated with reference to the Touchand their inclination to a place. For the Touch determines vital faculties:warm, cold; dry, moist; smooth, rough; yielding, resisting; soft, hard. Butheavy and light the Touch prejudges. Reason defines by inclination to move tothe middle and from the middle. Below and the middle they affirm to be the samething, for the center of a globe is below. Whatsoever is between that and thecircumference is above.Heat, seems to consist of rare parts, and disintegrates bodies; Cold, of moredense parts, and binds the pores. The Taste resembles the Touch in concretionand discretion, and in penetration of the pores, and in its objects, which areeither harsh or smooth. Those which have a cleansing or scouring faculty stupifythe tongue and are bitter. Those which are moderately purgative, salt. Thosewhich inflame and pierce further into the flesh, acid. Contrary to these, aresmooth and sweet. The kinds of odor are not distinct for they insinuate throughnarrow pores which are too solid to be contracted and dilated by putrefaction,and concoction of earth and earthly things. They are sweet or stinking.Voice is a percussion in the air passing to the soul through the ears, whosepores extend to the liver. In the ears is a spirit whose motion is Hearing. Ofvoice and hearing some are swift, the sharp; some slow, the flat; the mean areincommensurable. Again, one is much and diffused, the loud; another small andcontracted, the low; one is ordered according to proportions, the harmonious;another disorderly and unproportionate, the inharmonious.The fourth kind of Sensibles is most various and multiform—termedVisibles—comprising all colors, and innumerable colored things. The primarycolors are four: White, Black, Bright, Purple. The rest are made by mixing thesetogether. White disperses the sight. Black contracts it, as hot diffuses thetouch. Cold contracts it. Bitter contracts the taste, and sweet dissipates it.The bodies of creatures that breathe air are nourished by aliment, distributedby the veins through the whole frame defluxively, as by channels, and irrigatedby the spirit which diffuses it to the utmost bounds. Respiration is made (therebeing no vacuity in nature) by influxion, and attraction of the air in the roomof that which issued forth at invisible vents, out of which also sweatevaporates. Now something of it being wasted by the natural heat, it isnecessary something be introduced to supply that which was consumed. Otherwisethere would be a vacuity, which is impossible. For a living creature could notbe restored by perpetual fluxion and entire, if the body were disjoined byvacuity. The like composition of organs is likewise in inanimate things with ananalogical respiration. A cupping-glass and amber are resemblances ofrespiration. For the spirits evaporate through the body and enter again at themouth and nostrils by respiration; then again, like Euripus, it is brought roundinto the body which by these effuxions is extended. The cuppingglass, the airbeing consumed by fire, attracts moisture; the amber, by emission of spirits,attracts the body that is like to it.All aliment is taken into the body from the root of the heart, and the fountainof the ventricle; if the accession be more than the flowing down, it is termedGrowth; if the contrary, Decay. The Acme consists in the confine between thesetwo, and is conceived to be the equality of accession and emanation. When theligaments of the constitution are dissolved, so as there is no passage for thebreath, or distribution of aliment, the animal dies.There are many things which are pernicious to life and cause death; whereof oneis termed Sickness. The origins of sickness are the disproportions of theprimary faculties. If the simple faculties—Heat, Cold, Humidity, Dryness—abound,or are deficient, then follow mutations and alterations of the blood bycorruption, and deprivations of the consumptive flesh. If according to thechanges into Sharp, or Salt, or Acid (humours) the turnings of the blood, orconsumptions of the flesh be caused; for hence are generated Choler and Phlegm.Unwholesome Chyles and putrefaction of Humours are inconsiderable except they bedeep; but those whose causes lie in the bones are not easily cured; those whicharise out of the marrow are painful. The extremities of Diseases are Wind,Choler, Phlegm, increasing and flowing into places not proper to them, or intothe vital parts. For then obtaining a better place, they expel their neighborsand settle there, and afflicting the bodies, they resolve them into themselves.These are the diseases of the body. Out of these arise many sicknesses of thesoul, several of several faculties. These are: of the sensitive, stupidity; ofthe reminiscent, forgetfulness; of the desiderative, loathing and excessiveappetite; of the pathetic, wild passions and furious frenzies; of the rational,indocility and indiscretion. The forces of vice are pleasures and griefs,desires and fears, raised out of the body, mingled with the soul, and expressedby various names: loves, desires, dissolute affections, impetuous angers, deepmalices, various longings, inordinate delights. In a word, to behave ourselvesamiss as to passions, or to subdue them, is the bound between virtue and vice.For to be excessive in them, or too hard for them, puts us in a good or badcondition.To these inclinations, the temper of the body may contribute much. If vehement,abject, or anyway extraordinary, it transports us to melancholy and extravagantlusts. For the parts being overflown by these emanations make the constitutionof the body rather turgid than sound, whence arise sadness, forgetfulness,folly, and consternation. The customs also whereunto a man has conformed himselfin the city or family where he was born and bred, conduce much. This is alsotrue of the daily course of life, whether softening or corroborating the soul.For living abroad, diet, exercise, and the manners of those with whom weconverse, greatly avail to virtue or vice. And these occasions are derivedrather from our parents and elements, than from ourselves. For they are notineffectual; we are ourselves so easily receding from those actions which aregood.963 [endnote.xhtml#ftn963]To the well-being of an animal, it is requisite that the body have the virtuescompetent to it: Health, perfect Sense, Strength, and Beauty. The principles ofBeauty are a symmetry of the parts amongst themselves and with the soul; fornature made the body as an instrument, obedient and accommodate to all thebusinesses of life. In like manner, the soul must be ordered to virtuesanswerable to those: to Temperance, as the body to Health; to Wisdom, as thebody to perfect sense; to Fortitude, as the body to strength; to Justice, as thebody to beauty.The principles of these are from Nature; their means and ends from industry.Those of the body are attained by exercise and Medicine; those of the Soul byInstitution and Philosophy. For these faculties nourish and strengthen both thesoul and body by labor, exercise and pureness of diet—these by medicaments;those instituting the soul by chastisements and reprehensions. For theystrengthen it, by exhortation, by exciting the inclination, and enjoining thosethings which are expedient for action.The gymnastic art, and its nearest ally Medicine, are designed for the cure ofbodies—reducing the faculties to the best harmony. They purify the blood andmake the spirits flow freely, so that if anything unwholesome settle, the vigorsof the blood and spirits being thus confirmed, overmaster it. Music, and itsdirector Philosophy—ordained by the gods and by the laws for reformation of thesoul—inure, compel and persuade the irrational part to obey the rational, and inthe irrational mollify anger, and quiet desire; so they neither move nor restwithout reason, the mind summoning them either to action or fruition.The bound of temperance is obedience and fortitude. Now science and venerablephilosophy, purifying the mind from false opinions, bring her to knowledge. Andreducing her from great ignorance, raise her to contemplation of Divine things;wherein if a man be conversant with contentedness as to human things, andendeavor in a moderate way of living, he is happy. For he to whom God hasallotted this estate is undoubtedly guided to a most happy life.But if a man be stiff and refractory, he shall be pursued by punishmentaccording to the laws and those discourses which declare things Celestial andInfernal. For irremissible punishments are prepared for the unhappy dead andmany other things; for which I commend the Ionic poet, who makes men religiousby ancient fabulous Traditions. For as we cure bodies with things unwholesomewhen the wholesome agree not with them, so we restrain souls with fabulousrelations when they will not be led by the true. Let them then—since there is anecessity for it—talk of these strange punishments: as if souls didtransmigrate: those of the effeminate into the bodies of women given up toignominy; of murderers into those of beasts for punishment; of the lasciviousinto the forms of swine; of the light and temerarious into birds; of theslothful, and idle, unlearned, and ignorant into several kinds of fishes. Allthese in the second period Nemesis decrees, together with the vindictive andTerrestrial Daemons, the overseers of human affairs to whom God, the disposer ofall things, has committed the administration of the World—replenished with gods,men, and all other living creatures. All of which are formed after the bestimage of the ungenerate and eternal Idea."},{"pageContent":"An Explication of the Pythagorean Doctrine By John Reuchlin964[endnote.xhtml#ftn964]CHAPTER 1OF PYTHAGORAS: HIS WAY OF TEACHING, BY SILENCE AND SYMBOLSThe incommunicable and abstruse tradition of Mysteries and Symbols is not to beinvestigated by acuteness of human wit (which rather affects us with a doubtfulfear than an adherent firmness). It requires ample strength of thinking andbelieving, and above all things, faith and taciturnity.965[endnote.xhtml#ftn965] Whence Pythagoras taught nothing (as Apuleius says) tohis disciples before silence; it being the first rudiment of contemplativewisdom to learn to meditate, and to unlearn to talk.966 [endnote.xhtml#ftn966]As if the Pythagorean sublimity were of greater worth than to be comprehended bythe talk of boys. This kind of learning (as other things) Pythagoras broughtinto Greece from the Hebrews. That the disciple intending to ask some sublimequestion, should hold his peace; and being questioned, should only answer images[images/312.png], “He said.”† Thus the Cabalists answer images[images/312_1.png], “The wise said”; and Christians, pioteuoov, “Believe.”†Moreover, all the Pythagorean philosophy (especially that which concerns divinethings) is mystical, expressed by Riddles and Symbols.967 [endnote.xhtml#ftn967]The reasons are these: First, the Ancients used to deliver wisdom by Allegories.All their Philosophers and Poets are full of Riddles, avoiding by obscuritycontempt of the vulgar. For the most apt interpreter of things not perceptibleby human infirmity is Fable. That befits Philosophers which is declared underthe pious veil of fictions, hidden in honest things, and attired in honestwords. For what is easily found is but too negligently pursued. Secondly, itsometimes happens that we cannot express abstruse things without muchcircumlocution, unless by some short Parable. Thirdly, as generals usewatch-words to distinguish their own soldiers from others, so it is not improperto communicate to friends some peculiar Symbols as distinctive marks of aSociety. These, among the Pythagoreans, were a chain of indissoluble love.Pythagoras was studious of friendship; and if he heard of any that used hisSymbols, he presently admitted him into his Society.968 [endnote.xhtml#ftn968]Hereupon all became desirous of them—as well thereby to be acceptable to theirMaster as to be known as Pythagoreans. Lastly, symbols may serve as memorialnotes. For in treating of all things divine and human, the vastness of thesubject requires short Symbols as conducing much to memory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE TRIPLE WORLDThe Pythagoreans reduce all Beings, subsistent or substantive, immediately toIdeas which truly are; and those to the Idea of Ideas.969 [endnote.xhtml#ftn969]Hereupon they asserted three Worlds—whereof the third is infinite, or rathernot-finite—and that all things consist of Three. The Pythagoreans (saysAristole) affirm that the whole and all things are terminated by three. Some arebodies and magnitudes, others keep and inhabit bodies and magnitude, others arethe rulers and origins of the inhabitants. This we understand of the threeWorlds: the Inferior, the Superior, and the Supreme.The Inferior contains bodies, and magnitudes, and their appropriateIntelligences, movers of the Spheres, overseers, and guardians of thingsgenerable and corruptible, who are said to take care of bodies, each accordingto the particular task assigned him. By the Ancients, they are named sometimesAngels, sometimes gods, and (in respect of the anxious solicitude of thingswhereto they are confined) Daemons.Next over it immediately shines the Superior World. This contains the superiorPowers, incorporeal essences, divine exemplars, the seals of the inferior World,after whose likeness the faces of all inferior things are formed. ThesePythagoras calls “Immortal Gods,”970 [endnote.xhtml#ftn970] as being theprinciples of things produced out of the Divine Mind, essential images[images/314.png]. They are the causes of those forms which dwell in bodies, andinform the compounded substances of the lower World. There are also other gods,incorporeal beings, individual, differing not by material, but by formal number.These are spirits, void of matter, simple, unmixed, seated beyond the sensibleHeaven, confined neither to time nor place, neither suffering age nortransmutation much less any alteration. In a word, not being affected with anypassion, they lead a self-sufficient excellent life, and inhabit Eternity, whichis images [images/314_1.png], always being, because it always was, is, and shallbe intemporally in the Divine Mind. Yet by the energy of God it was created andplaced beyond the convex of the visible Heaven, as being the lucid mansion ofthe blessed spirits (whom the Pythagoreans believe gods), placed in the highestregion of Aether, of everlasting duration, invested in the immortal Eternity.The third World, Supreme, containing all other Worlds, is that of the Deity,consisting of one divine Essence, existent before Eternity. For it is the Age ofAges, the preexistent entity and unity of existence, substance, essence, nature.These three Worlds are called “Receptacles” in different respects: the first, ofQuantity; the second, of Intelligences; the third, of Principles. The first,circumscriptively; the second, definitively; the third is not received, butreceives, because it is everywhere, and is called a replenishing receptacle.Through the Superior World is communicated—from the Tetractys to theinferior—life, and the being (not accidental, but substantial) of every species;to some, clearly; to others, obscurely. This the Pythagoreans collect from thosewords of their Master:—The Tetractys to our Souls did send,The Fountain of Eternal Nature—971 [endnote.xhtml#ftn971]The Tetractys is the Divine Mind communicating. The Fountain is the exemplarIdea communicated. And eternal Nature is the essential Idea of things received.Idea, considered as to God (say they), is his knowledge; as to the sensibleWorld, exemplar; as to itself, Essence.Now as in the Sensible World the Superior sphere has an influence on all theSpheres beneath it, so in the Intelligible World. Not only every superior Chorusof Angels has an influence upon all the inferior, but the whole superior Worldhas an influence upon the whole inferior. Whereby all things are reducedaccording to their capacities as far as possible: momentary to Eternal, inferiorto superior. But to the third World, nothing that is merely a creature can bereduced, incapable in its own nature of that sublimity which is proper only toGod."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE SUPREME WORLDThe Supreme World, being (as we said) that of the Deity, is one, divine,continual, constant Essence of Sempiternity, poised (as it were) with immoveableweight. It is termed images [images/316.png], the all-governing Throne.972[endnote.xhtml#ftn972] Not confined to genus, place, time, nor reason, it is thefree unlimited president over all these; infinitely supreme in place, power,possession, excellence, above all Essence, Nature, Eternity, Age.This Divine Mind, the receptacle of principles, Pythagoras symbolically termsNumber; saying Number is the Principle of all things. (For none can believe someanly of so wise a person, as that he should conceive the ordinary numbers bywhich we cast account, to be the Principles of all things—which are far frombeing antecedent to things, for they are consequential accidents.) So Plutarch:by Number Pythagoras understands the Mind, a Symbol not improper; inIncorporeals nothing more divine than the Mind; in Abstractions nothing moresimple than Number.973 [endnote.xhtml#ftn973]The divine Essence therefore—existent before Eternity and Age (for it is the Ageof Ages), the preexistent entity and unity of existence, substance, essence,nature—was by Pythagoras called images [images/316_0.png], ONE; by Parmenidesimages [images/316_1.png], BEING, both upon a like ground. Because it is thesuper-essential Unit and Being, from which, by which, through which, in which,and to which all things are; and are ordered, and persist, and are contained,and are filled, and are converted.Of this first one, and first Ens, Aristotle says thus: Plato and thePythagoreans hold no other concerning Ens or One. But that this is their nature,their essence is the same, to be One and a Being. Xenophanes declared this Oneto be God, herein agreeing with Pythagoras, who asserted infinite, and one, andnumber, to be the first Principles of things. By “infinite” is signified thepower, for nothing can be imagined before power, which in God is infinite, orrather it is infinite God. In him Esse and Posse are not distinct. He containsthe essences, virtues, and operations of all producibles.974[endnote.xhtml#ftn974]With Pythagoras agrees Anaxagoras, for all things were together.975[endnote.xhtml#ftn975] Democritus says all thing were in power. This also is themixing of things mentioned by Empedocles and Anaximander. Not confusedly inChaos, Erebus, or Night; but distinctly and orderly in full light, in the mostperfect splendor of the divine light, intuitive knowledge. That is the IDEA(from images [images/317_0.png] [“seeing, meaning understanding”]†), whose poweris being. It includes all, whether mental, rational, intelligible, sensible,vital, substantial, or adhesive; and is not only all things that are, but thosethat are not.This is no other than the divine Essence—within which (before all things) oneproduced two. Two is the first number; one is the principle of Number; One isGod. And the production of two is within the divine Essence (for number isconstituted of itself, and next one is naturally only the number two). This twomust necessarily be God also, for within God is nothing but God. Thus thesethree (One and Two) being the Principle and first, and not exceeding the Essenceof God, are indeed one God. For his Essence is not divided by the production oftwo out of one. In like manner it often happens in corporeals, that one beingmoved to two, proceeds to three, the substance of things continuing. Forexample, as in a tree, of boughs and branches; in man, the body arms andfingers. Of one therefore in the Divinity producing, and two produced, arises aTrinity to which, if there be added an essence formally distinct from them,there will be a formal Quaternity. This is the infinite one and two, theSubstance, Perfection, and end of all Number. One, two, three, four by acollective progression make Ten; beyond ten there is not anything. ThisPythagoras meant, when he asserted that the Principle of all things is theTetractys. He understood God by it; for he swore by it, and seems to havetransferred the Hebrew Tetragammaton into Greek Symbol.Thus the most apt symbol of the Principles of things is one and two. For when wemake enquiry into the causes and origin of all things, what sooner occurs thanone and two?976 [endnote.xhtml#ftn976] That which we first behold with our eyesis the same and not another; that which we first conceive in our mind isIdentity and Diversity, One and Two. Alcmaeon (contemporary with Pythagoras)affirmed two to be many—which he said were contrarieties (perhaps the same withEmpedocles images [images/318_0.png] [“strife”]†), yet unconfined andindefinite, such as white and black, sweet and bitter, good and evil, great andsmall.These multiplex diversities the Pythagoreans designated by the number Ten: asfinite and infinite, even and odd, one and many, right and left, male andfemale, steadfast and moved, straight and crooked, light and darkness, good andill, square and oblong. These pairs are two, and therefore contrary; they arereduced all into ten, that being the most perfect number, as containing morekinds of numeration than the rest: even and odd, square and cube, long andshort, the first uncompounded and first compounded. Nothing is more absolutethan the number Ten, since in ten proportions, four cubic numbers areconsummated, of which (according to the Pythagoreans) all things consist. Bythis all nations reckon (not exceeding it) as by the natural account of tenfingers. Heaven itself consists of ten Spheres. Architas includes all that is inthe number ten. In imitation of whom Aristotle names ten kinds of Ens,categories, reducible to two, Substance and Accident, both springing from oneEssence. For ten so loves two that from one it proceeds to two, and by two itreverts into one.The first Ternary is of one and two, not compounded, but consistent. One havingno position makes no composition; a unit while a unit has no position, nor apoint while a point. There being nothing before One, we rightly say one isfirst. Two is not compounded of numbers but a co-ordination of units only. It istherefore the first number, being the first multitude. It is not commensurableby any number, only by unit, the common measure of all number. For one two isnothing but two. So that the multitude which is called “Triad,” Arithmeticiansterm the first number uncompounded, the Duad being not an uncompounded number,but rather not-compounded.Now the Triad, through its propensity to multiply and communicate its goodnessto all creatures, proceeds from power to operation.977 [endnote.xhtml#ftn977]The Triad, beholding with a perpetual intuition that fecundity of multitudewhich is in it—productive (as it were) of number from number—and thatessentiality which is one in it—the fountain of all production, the beginning ofall progression, the permanence of all immutable substance—it reverts itselfinto itself, multiplying itself (as it were) by unity and duality, saying, “Oncetwice two, are four.” This is the Tetractys, the Idea of all created things; forall progression is perfected in four.978 [endnote.xhtml#ftn978]Hence arises the Decad, the ten most general kinds of all things. One, two,three, four, going out of Omnipotency to Energy (out of power to act) produceten, the half whereof is five. Now in the midst put five, on the right hand thenext superior number six, on the left hand, the next inferior four; these addedtogether, make ten. Again, the next superior seven, and the next inferior threemake ten. Again, the next superior eight, and the next inferior two make ten.Lastly, one and nine make ten.This ten being carried up to twenty, comes again to one; and so on, in all thecardinal numbers to a hundred. For as twice one makes two, thrice one three,four times one four, and so forward; so twice ten makes twenty, thrice tenthirty, four times ten forty, and so on. The like in a hundred, a thousand, andforward. And because the Decad arises out of and ends in a Monad, the Greeksexpress ten by images [images/319_0.png] [iota]. The Hebrews express it by aPoint, which mark (as well amongst the Barbarians, as in Latin) denotes One.979[endnote.xhtml#ftn979] Hitherto allude the Pythagorean symbols One and Two.Zaratas (the Master of Pythagoras) used these as the names of propagation—onethe father; two the mother. One and two (in the divine essence) producing four,the Tetractys, the idea of all things, which are consummated in the number Ten.This Pythagoras styles:Eternal Nature's fountain—This is the knowledge of things in the Divine Mind operating intellectually.From this fountain of Eternal Nature, flows down the Pythagorean numbers One andTwo—which from Eternity, in the fountain of the immense Ocean, was, shall be, orrather always is, abundantly streaming. This One was by the Ancients termedimages [images/319_3.png] [“Zeus”], Jupiter; Two, images [images/319_4.png][“Hera”], Juno, wife and sister to Jupiter, of whom writes Homer:Golden-thron'd Juno, with eyes full of loveBeheld her spouse and brother, sacred Jove,Sitting on th' top of fount abounding Ide.980 [endnote.xhtml#ftn980]In Ide, images [images/320_0.png], from “prescience”) Jupiter and Juno sat asone and two—in the streaming idea of the Tetractys, whence flow the principlesof all things, Form and Matter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLDThe Intelligible World proceeds out of the Divine Mind after this manner.981[endnote.xhtml#ftn981] The Tetractys, reflecting upon its own essence as thefirst unit, productive of all things, and on its own beginning as the firstproduct, says thus. Once one, twice two, immediately arises a Tetrad, having onits top the highest unit. It is a pyramid whose base is a plain Tetrad,answerable to a superficies, upon which the radiant light of the divine unityproduces the form of incorporeal fire, by reason of the descent of Juno (Matter)to inferior things. Hence arises essential light, not burning but illuminating.This is the creation of the middle world, which the Hebrews call the Supreme,the world of the Deity, admitting no comparison. It is termed Olympus, images[images/321_0.png], wholly lucid and replete with separate forms—where is theseat of the Immortal gods, whose top is Unity, wall Trinity, superficiesQuaternity:—Deum domus alta [the high house of the gods]Number, emanating from the divinity by degrees, declines to the figure ofcreatures; instead of the Tetractys, a Tetragon. In each of its angles a point,for so many units, the unit at the top, which now begins to have position,elevated as much as is possible. Thus the former sides elevated will be fourtriangles, built upon their quadrangular latitude, and carried on to one highpoint. This is the Pyramid itself, the species of fire, of which a Pyramidhaving four bases and equal angles is compounded.982 [endnote.xhtml#ftn982] Itis the most immovable and penetrant form, without matter essential separatelight, next to God sempiternal life.The work of the Mind is life; the work of God is immortality, eternal life. Godhimself is not this created light, but the Author of all light, whereof in thedivine Trinity He contains a most absolute Pyramid, which implies the vigor ofFire. Whence the Chaldeans and Hebrews affirm that God is Fire. But the Pyramidwhich this divine Tetractys produces is the fiery light of the immaterial world,of separate intelligences, beyond the visible Heaven, termed images[images/322_4.png], age, eternity, aether.Having overcome these things (says Pythagoras), thou shalt know images[images/322.png], the cohabitation, of the immortal gods, and mortal men. †983[endnote.xhtml#ftn983] In which words are implied three properties of thismiddle world: Condition, Chorus, and Order. (Pythagoras terms the middle world“free Aether”; free, as being separated from the power of matter; Aether, asreceiving ardor from God and heating all inferiors by an insensible motion.)Condition: It is replenished with forms, simple, immaterial, separate, bothuniversal and individual, containing all ideations of genus and species. Theexemplars are imitated in lesser copies, their original being in the DivineMind. Thus the world of the Deity is the absolute exemplar: in the intelligibleworld the abstract example; and in the sensible world, not example butcontraction of exemplars, as seal, figure, and sealed wax.Chorus: It is the infinite joy of the blessed spirits, their immutable delight,styled by Homer images [images/322_0.png], inextinguishable laughter.† For whatgreater pleasure, than to behold the serene aspect of God; and next Him, theideas and forms of all things, more purely and transparently, than secondarilyin created beings? And to communicate these visions to inferiors, the office ofthe gods called images [images/322_2.png]images [images/322_3.png], fromspeculation and vision. These are the Angels communicating their visions toothers, not that we imagine them equal to the Supreme God who is ineffable. NoDaemons, how good soever, are admitted into this chorus: so says Plotinus (themost exact follower of the Pythagorean Mysteries, as Porphyry and Longinusattest). The gods we conceive to be void of passion.984 [endnote.xhtml#ftn984]But to Daemons we adjoin passions, saying they are sempiternal in the nextdegree after the gods. It is better to call none in the intelligible worldDaemon; rather, if a Daemon be placed there, to esteem him a god.Order: It is thus explained by Pythagoras. If thou live according to rightreason, grieving for what is ill done, and rejoicing in what is well done, andprayest the gods to perfect thy work:Then stript of flesh, up to free Aether soar,A deathless god, divine, mortal no more. 985 [endnote.xhtml#ftn985]This is the order in the acquisition of man's beatitude. The incorporeal Heavenof the middle world—the invisible Olympus of the blessed—admits nothing impure.Therefore vices are to be shunned and virtues to be embraced. The preservationof men is by the mercies of God. Therefore the Divinity is to be worshipped, andthe superior powers to be invoked, that they would perfect our work. Lastly,nothing material, corporeal, or mixed is received there. Therefore we must die,and wholly put off the body, before we can be admitted to the society of thegods."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE SENSIBLE WORLDWe now come down to the sensible World.986 [endnote.xhtml#ftn986] Its exemplaris the world of the Deity; its example the intelligible world of Ideas, theimages [images/324_0.png], subsistence of exemplars in itself. As One is thebeginning of the intelligible world, so is Two of the corporeal. It would not becorporeal if it did not consist of these four: point, line, superfices,solidity—after the pattern of the Cube, made by one, two, three, four.One, fixed by position, creates a point. A line, being protracted from one pointto another, is made of the number two. A superfices arises from three lines. Asolid contains four positions: before, behind, upwards, downwards. Twomultiplied in itself produces four; retorted into itself (by saying twice twotwice) makes the first Cube. Next five (the Tetragonical Pyramid, principle ofthe Intelligible World) is the cube of eight with six sides, architect of theSensible World. Amongst principles, the Heptad has no place, being virgin,producing nothing, and therefore named Pallas.This first cube is a fertile number, the ground of multitude and variety,constituted of two and of four. Zaratas termed two “the Mother”; we call thecube that proceedes from it “Matter,” the bottom and foundation of all naturalbeings, the seat of substantial forms. Timaeus says: from the Tetragon isgenerated the Cube, the most settled body, steadfast every way, having sixsides, eight angles.987 [endnote.xhtml#ftn987] The form immersed in this solidreceptacle is not received loosely, but fixedly and singly. It becomesindividual and incommunicable, confined to time and place, losing its liberty inthe servitude of Matter. Thus the two principles of temporal things: the Pyramidand Cube, Form and Matter, flow from one fountain, the Tetragon, whose Idea isthe Tetractys, the divine exemplar.Now there is requisite some third thing to unite these two, Matter and Form. Forthey flow not into one another spontaneously or casually; the matter of onething does not contingently receive the form of another. When the soul departsout of man, the body becomes not brass or iron, neither is wool made of a stone.There must then be a third thing to unite them. (Not privation: privation andpower act nothing substantively. Nor motion: an accident cannot be the principleof a substance.) God is the uniter, as Socrates and Plato acknowledge.988[endnote.xhtml#ftn988] They say there are three principles of things: God, Idea,and Matter—symbolized before by Pythagoras in these three secret marks:Infinite, One and Two. By Infinite, designing God; by Unity, Form; by Diversity,Matter. Infinite, in the Supreme world; One, or Identity, in the Intellectual;Two, or Diversity, in the Sensible, for Matter is the mother of Alteration.The Tetragonal bases of these figures, joined together, make a Dodecahedron, thesymbol of the Universe. Alcinous says God used the Dodecahedron in making theUniverse this world. 989 [endnote.xhtml#ftn989] If upon an octangle Cube weerect a Pyramid, by four equal-sided triangles, it makes a Dodecahedron, whereinthe Cube is, as it were, mother, and the Pyramid, father. Thus Timaeus: Form hasthe nature of male and father; Matter of female and mother; the compositions aretheir offspring.990 [endnote.xhtml#ftn990]Of these are produced all things in this world by their seminal faculties; whichthings appear in a wonderful variety by reason of the various commensuration offorms to their matter, and the admixture of innumerable accidents—by excess anddefect, discord and amity, motion and rest, impetuosity and tranquility, rarityand density. Hence arise the Spheres, the Stars, the four Elements: out of whichcome forth hot, moist, cold, dry, and all the objects of sense, thetransmutation of forms, and variety of colors in several things.The gods are natural, the gods of gods supernatural. Those inhabit the inferiorworld, these the superior. The gods of gods are most simple and pure, as beingnowhere. They are supercelestial as being everywhere. They are with us herestrangers, there natives; never in our world, but when sent: Angels, messengersfrom heaven, appearing in what form they please, kind and beneficial to us. Theinferior spirits never ascend to the super celestial, but are sent sometimes onembassy to us, whence termed Angels as the others.God himself inhabits the lowest, the highest, and the middlemost intimately; sothat there is no being without God. Moreover, the gods of this world are moreexcellent than the souls of men—though those assist, these inform bodies.Between them are placed Daemons and Heroes—Daemons next the gods, Heroes nextsouls—mentioned by Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, who assigns to each apeculiar worship.images [images/326.png]Croesus (561-546 B.C.), the Lydian king so rich that his name became proverbialfor wealth, issued this gold stater which shows the confronted foreparts of alion and a bull.

He is not content solely with one operation (as all other thingsdrawn along by nature, which always act after the same manner), but imbued withvarious gifts, which he uses according to his free will. In respect of whichliberty:—Men are of heavenly race,Taught by diviner Nature what t'embrace. 992 [endnote.xhtml#ftn992]By “diviner Nature” is meant the Intellectual soul. As to intellect, manapproaches nigh to God; as to inferior senses, he recedes from God. Reasonteaching us what to embrace, when it converts itself to the mind, renders usblessed. When perverted by the senses, wretched. For men often straying from therule of right reason precipitate themselves into misery, images[images/327.png], in Pythagoras's word, incurring ills voluntarily.†Thus is man placed between Virtue and Vice, like the stalk between the twobranches in the Pythagorean Y,† or young Hercules described by Prodicus. Astherefore none can be called happy before his death (as Solon said to Croesus993[endnote.xhtml#ftn993]), so none is to be esteemed unhappy while he is in thislife. We must expect the last day of a man. If when he has put off his body, heremains burdened with vices, then begins he to be truly miserable. This miseryafter death Pythagoras divides into two kinds. The unhappy are either nearBeatitude, which though at the present they enjoy not, yet are they notoppressed with extreme misery, being hereafter to be delivered from theirpunishment. Or wholly distant from Beatitude, in endless infinite pains. Thusthere are two mansions in the Inferi: the Elysium, possesed by those that are toascend into blessedness; and Tartarus, by those who endure infinite tormentsimages [images/327_1.png]-images [images/327_2.png]. From these torments, Plato,imitating Pythagoras, says they never come out.† But when a man who has livedjustly dies, his soul ascends to the pure Aether and lives in the happy realm ofEternity with the blessed, as a god with the gods.Man is the image of the world. He, in many things, metaphorically receives thenames of the world.994 [endnote.xhtml#ftn994] The mind of man (as the Suprememind) is termed God by participation. The rational soul, if directed by the mindit incline the will to virtue, is termed the good Daemon or Genius; if byphantasie and ill affections it draws the will to vices, the evil Daemon. WhencePythagoras desires of God to keep us from ill, and to show everyone the Daemonhe ought to use.995 [endnote.xhtml#ftn995] Leaving the body, the soul if defiledwith vices becomes an evil Daemon. Its life, images [images/328.png],infelicity; but if having forsaken vice it retain a solicitous affection to thegood exercises and virtues which it practiced in this life, it shall become agood Daemon. And in the amenity of that world live happily, reflecting with joyupon the good actions it has done, and retaining the same willingness to theright doing of them. This life is images [images/328_1.png], felicity, of whichVirgil says:996 [endnote.xhtml#ftn996]—the same careWhich heretofore, breathing this vital air,Of Chariots, Arms, and sleek-skin'd Steeds theyPursues them now in earth's cold bosom laid.These souls the Ancients termed Lemures. Of these, that which lives in and takescare of any particular house is Lar familiaris. That which, for its demerits inthis life, wanders up and down in the air, a terror, vain to good men, but tothe bad hurtful is Larva. Those which are not certainly known to be Larvae orLares, are called Dii manes: Dii, out of reverence, who having performed thecourse of their lives prudently and justly, died holy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7OF THE PYTHAGOREAN TRANSMIGRATIONIt is commonly averred that Pythagoras held the opinion that the souls of menafter death informed the bodies of beasts. We cannot imagine this of so knowinga person. The suspicion of this Transanimation seems rather to have been raisedby such as were partly ignorant and partly envious of the Pythagorean mysteries.These included Timon, Xenophanes, Cratinus, Aristophon, Herippus, and others whohave ascribed many things to Pythagoras which he never said nor wrote, and haveperverted what he did say.997 [endnote.xhtml#ftn997]Pythagoras held that the substantive unity of one number is not the unity ofanother number. That the Monads in the Duad are not connected to those in theTriad. That the participate essence of everything is One, which will not occupythe essence of another thing.No animal (then) can transmigrate into the life of a different animal. But itmust continue under the Law of its own nature in its proper office, images[images/329.png], species not being coincident with species. One seal may makemany impressions upon several pieces of wax, but one piece of wax cannot bearthe form of many seals.The seal of human form (the image of God) is not permitted to set an impressionupon inferior nature—implied by Pythagoras in this Symbol, We must not wear theimage of God in a Seal-ring.998 [endnote.xhtml#ftn998] The image of God (man'ssoul) cannot seal or form the other natures that are near it. So HermesTrismegistus, “Of man, one part is simple, which we call the form of divinesimilitude.” And again, “There are two images of God, the World and Man.”This is the meaning of Pythagoras concerning the transmigration of souls afterdeath and their descent into life. Others thought that the soul is drawn forthout of the power of Matter; Pythagoras asserted it is infused by God into thebody, and therefore before it, not in time but in purity and dignity. Thisinfusion he termed, “The descent of the soul.” This is not be be understood asits situation or its motion from the intellectual world, as interpreted byseveral who heard the elementary idea such as Proclus; but of the natural seriesor form—the rational soul being the ultimate perfection of the human body.That Pythagoras said he was in times past Euphorbus, the meaning is this.999[endnote.xhtml#ftn999] The Ancients called the inclinations and wills of mentheir Minds; whence such as are of one study, intention, inclination, motion,and sense are termed Unanimous. Thus the ancient Philosophers call the motiveand sensitive faculty, the Soul. An animate differs from an inanimate (saysAristotle) chiefly in two things: Motion and Sense. Whosoever therefore arealike affected and moved by the same object are said to have the same Soul. TheMetempsychosis then is nothing else but equal care, motion, and study of somedead person appearing in some living person. Thus Pythagoras might arrogate thesoul of Euphorbus, Callicles, Hermotimus, Pyrrhus, Pyrander, Calidona, and Alceas having an inclination to the several excellencies that were in those persons.Again, in saying he was Euphorbus, Pythagoras enigmatically taught not thetransmigration of souls, but the transmutation of bodies out of firstmatter.1000 [endnote.xhtml#ftn1000] It is not only susceptible, but covetous ofall forms, continually desiring, never satiated with any. It is as if a comedy(to use the comparison of Aristotle) should say, “I was first a tragedy,”because both tragedy and comedy are formed of the same letters and elements.1001[endnote.xhtml#ftn1001] Thus Apollonius, demanding of the Indian Brahmans whattheir opinion was concerning the Soul, Iarchus answered, “According asPythagoras delivered to you, we to the Egyptians.” Apollonius replies, “Will youthen affirm you were one of the Trojan captains, as Pythagoras said he wasEuphorbus?” Thespasion warily asks, whom he thought the most worthy of them?“Achilles,” saith Apollonius, “if we believe Homer.” Then Iarchis said, “Look onhim as my progenitor, or images [images/330.png], progeniting body;† for suchPythagoras esteemed Euphorbus.”1002 [endnote.xhtml#ftn1002]Or if he meant it historically, images [images/330_1.png], that is the soul,separate from the body, may by the power of God be brought again the same intothe same body. The body in which Pythagoras was so often revived, though calledby several names, was one and the same—not in quantity, but substance. As thesea is one and homogeneous in itself, yet is here called Aegean, there Ionian,elsewhere Myrtaean and Colsaean—so one man often reborn is named Aethalides,Euphorbus, Hermotimus, Pyrrhus, and lastly Pythagoras.

DANIEL GUNTHER(marked with †)p. 79 images [images/367_1.jpg], “Genuine.”From Iamblicus', Life of Pythagoras, Cap. 18 (Kiessling, Iamblichi ChalcidensisEx Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1, p.172)p. 88 images [images/367_3.jpg] a Magician.The word images [images/367_8.jpg] is not the normal word for “magician.” Itrefers to one who examines animal entrails for the purpose of divination. Cf.Schmidt, Hesychii Alexandrini Lexicon, Editionem Minorem p.342, Liddell Scott, AGreek-English Lexicon p. 344b, images [images/367_2.jpg] and p.1628b, images[images/367_9.jpg] The accusation of Timon that Pythagoras was a images[images/367_2.jpg] is contradicted by the account in Chapter 15, ‘Divination byNumbers' (see page 169 [p3_sec1a_chap15.xhtml#page_169]) where we find anaccount of divination where Pythagoras rejects the use of animal entrails: “Thestudent of Pythagoras, Abaris, performed those kinds of sacrifices to which hewas accustomed, and diligently practiced divination after the ways of theBarbarians by victims (principally of cocks, whose entrals they conceived to bemost exact for inspection). Pythagoras, not willing to take him away from hisstudy of truth; yet, in order to direct him by a safer way, without blood andslaughter (moreover esteeming the cock sacred to the Sun), taught Abaris to findout all truth by the science of arithmetic.”p. 96 And that he chiefly praised Homer, for saving, images [images/367_5.jpg],the shepherd of the people.The phrase is used by Homer multiple times as an epithet of a ruler.For one example, see The Odyssey, III, line 156 and IV, line 541 where thephrase is applied to Agamemnon. (Palmer, The Odyssey of Homer, Books I-XII. TheText, And An English Version In Rhythmic Prose, pp. 74 & 132.)p. 99 images [images/367_4.jpg] [“One that practices bodily exercises”.] images[images/367_6.jpg] (“Exercitator”…)For images [images/367_7.jpg] , “One that practices bodily exercises,” Cf.Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon p. 1749B, and Dindorf, ClementisAlexandrini Opera, p. 421 par. 266, 10. For images [images/267_8.jpg], readliterally “one who annoints,” i.e. one who applied ointments in a gymnasium. Cf.Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon p. 62a. The reference is to the NaturalHistory of Pliny Secundi, Liber XXIII, Chap. 7 which extols the virtues of thefig: Pythagoras exercitator primus ad carnes eos transtulit. “Pythagoras, thegymnist (exercitator), being the first who introduced them to a flesh diet.”(Perhaps meaning that he used figs to assist in putting on weight. Cf. Mayhoff,C. Plini Secundi Naturalis Historiae, Vol. 4 p. 38, and Bostock & Riley, TheNatural History of Pliny, Vol. 4 , p. 503)p. 99 images [images/368_1.jpg], [“He said it”]The phrase images [images/368_2.jpg] implies “The Master said it”; Latin Ipsedixit. It was associated with Pythagoras whose students in a debate would argueipse dixit, (“He said it himself”), meaning Pythagoras, and considered itsufficent proof of an argument even without evidence. Cf. Cicero, De NaturaDeorum (Liber I, Cap.V,10. Latin text is given in Mayor, M. Tulli Ciceronis DeNatura Deorum Libri Tres, Vol. 1, p. 4) Cicero was in turn quoted to this effectby Valerius Maximus, Memorable Doings And Sayings, Book VIII. 15. Ext. 1.According to Joseph Mayor, Socrates was also called images [images/368_3.jpg] byhis disciples. Both the Latin and Greek pronouns were used colloquially byslaves of their masters. (M. Tulli Ciceronis De Natura Deorum Libri Tres, Vol.1, p. 77) It is interesting to note that Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) wouldeventually utilize the Latin phrase to form the word ipse-dixitism, which isused to signify an unsupported or dogmatic argument.p. 99 images [images/368_4.jpg] “squill” or “sea-onion,” Urginea maritima.The plant was used in the Mediterranean area medicinally and as rat poison.Pliny, in Liber XIX, Chapter 30 of his Natural History, wrote that, “thephilosopher Pythagoras has written a whole volume on the merits of this plant,setting forth its various medicinal properties.,” and further, in Liber XX,Chapter 39, “Pythagoras says that a squill suspended at the threshold of a door,effectively shuts all access to evil spells and incantations..” (See Bostock &Riley, The Natural History of Pliny, Vol. IV, pp. 168-169 and 243. The Latintext is in Mayhoff, C. Plini Secundi Naturalis Historiae, Vol. 3, pp. 273-274and 372.)p. 100 images [images/368_5.jpg]An interrogative particle meaning in this case, “what?” i.e., “what clothes?”The passage in full reads as follows:images [images/368_6.jpg]“And she recommended a woman, who was going to her husband, to put off hermodesty with her clothes, and when she left him, to resume it again with herclothes; and when she was asked, “What clothes?” she said, “Those which causeyou to be called a woman.”(Yonge, Diogenes Laërtius, The Lives And Opinions of Eminent Philosophers p.356. Cf. Hicks, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Vol. 2, pp.357-359)p. 118 images [images/369_1.jpg] “He said it.”See above, note to page 99 [p1_chap20.xhtml#page_99].p. 122 images [images/369_2.jpg] a quinquennial silence.From Iamblicus, Life of Pythagoras, Cap. 17 (Kiessling, Iamblichi ChalcidensisEx Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1, p. 154)p. 122 images [images/369_3.jpg] [“keeping silent”], images [images/369_4.jpg]from keeping our speech within ourselves. Read images [images/369_5.jpg][“keeping silent”], images [images/369_6.jpg] The word images [images/369_7.jpg]is a synonym of images [images/369_8.jpg]See Schmidt, M., Hesychii Alexandrini Lexicon under images [images/369_9.jpg]and Liddell-Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 747b under images[images/369_10.jpg] silence, reserve.)p. 134. Quinquennial silence, images [images/369_11.jpg]“Quinquennial silence” is the translation of images [images/369_12.jpg](Iamblicus, Life of Pythagoras, Cap. 17) which Stanley mentioned specificallyearlier on page 122 [p2_chap4.xhtml#page_122] (see note above.) The quinquennialsilence was also called images [images/369_13.jpg]p. 142 images [images/369_14.jpg] [“a thing pricked,” i.e. “traced outbeforehand”].A design for a finished work, perhaps etched into the raw material. Cf. LiddellScott A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 1486a images [images/369_15.jpg].p. 149 images [images/369_16.jpg] “separation” (from multitude).The etymological signification of the word images [images/369_18.jpg] “Monad,”according to Theon Smyrnaeus, was based on the fact that it remained unalteredif multiplied by itself, or that is separated and isolated (images[images/369_17.jpg]) from the remaining multitude of numbers. (Heath, TheThirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, Vol. 2 , p. 279)p. 152 images [images/370_1.jpg] judgment.Derived from images [images/370_2.jpg], “separate one from another,” in thesense of “a discerning, distinguishing.” Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-EnglishLexicon, p. 399a. “Meursius” refers to the classical scholar Johannes Meursius(15791639)p. 153 images [images/370_3.jpg] “silver-footed,” or “silver-sandalled.”The word is used as an epithet of Thetis in Homer's Iliad, I, 538. Cf. Monro,Iliad, Books I-XII, p. 18. Cf. also Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p.236b under images [images/370_4.jpg]p. 161 images [images/370_5.jpg]The literal meaning is “whole of limb, not dismembered.” Cf. Liddell Scott, AGreek-English Lexicon p. 1218a.p. 162 images [images/370_6.jpg] [“central oarsman”].This refers to the central oarsmen of the style of Greek warship called the“Trireme” (images [images/370_7.jpg]) The ship had three rows of oarsmen. Therowers with the longest oars who sat in the mid-most point of the boat. Used inthe same sense as images [images/370_16.jpg]. (Cf. Liddell Scott, AGreek-English Lexicon, pp. 1106b, 1107a.)p. 162 images [images/370_8.jpg] [“hurled forth”].The notion is that the Triad (Hecate) is hurled forth and joined with anotherTriad to form the Hexad. Cf. Thomas Taylor, Theoretic Arithmetic p. 198.p. 163images [images/370_9.jpg] “The Unwearied.”An epithet of Pallas Athena. Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p.273b, images [images/370_10.jpg]p. 164 images [images/370_11.jpg] TritogeniaLiterally, “daughter of a mighty father,” an epithet of Athena. Thus also“Tritogenia” (Greek images [images/370_12.jpg]), “Trito-born,” explained inantiquity as either the lake Tritonis (images [images/370_13.jpg]) in Libya fromwhich Athena was said to have been born. Another explanation is from Triton, aspring in Arcadia. Yet another is from the word images [images/370_17.jpg] anAeolic word for images [images/370_14.jpg] “head,” thus “head-born.” Cf. LiddellScott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 1823b.p. 164 images [images/370_15.jpg] [“Blue-eyed”].Another epithet of Athena. From Pausanias' Description of Greece (1.14.6), “Iwas not surprised that an image of Athena stood beside Hephaestus; but observingthat Athena's image had blue eyes, I recognized the Libyan version of the myth.For the Libyans say that she is a daughter of Poseidon and the Tritonian lake,and that she, like Poseidon, has blue eyes.” (Frazer, Pausanias's Description ofGreece, Vol. 1, p. 21). The belief that the Greeks understood the epithet images[images/371_1.jpg] to mean “blue-eyed” is strengthened by this passage inPausanias. Cf. Frazer, Pausanias's Description of Greece, Vol. 2, p. 128 for hiscommentary on Pausanias' 1.14.6.p. 164 ‘images [images/371_2.jpg] [“Protectress”].An epithet of Athena mentioned by Homer in The Iliad, IV,8 (images[images/371_3.jpg] images [images/371_4.jpg]). Also mentioned by Pausanias, Book9, Chapter 33, who says it was a villiage of no great size, which got its namefrom Alalkomenes, a native (images [images/371_5.jpg]), who is said to havereared Athena, or alternately, Alalkomenia was one of the daughters of Ogyges.(Cf. Sibelis, Pausaniae Graeciae Descripto, Vol. 4 pp. 222-223) In hiscommentary on The Iliad, Leaf writes, “It is hard to say whether the local orattributive sense prevails in this title. Pausanias testifies to a cultus ofAthene at Alalkomenai, near the Tritonian lake Boiotia, down to the time ofSulla; but the word is evidently also significant, ‘the guardian’. (We hear alsoof images [images/371_6.jpg] images [images/371_7.jpg] in the Et. Mag. (i.e.Etymologia Magnum)) Probably the name of the town was taken was either takenfrom the title of the goddess or adapted to it from an older form, or was itselfthe cause of the adoption of the cultus; a local adjective being then formedwith a distinct consciousness of its original significance.” (Leaf, The Iliad,Vol. 1, p. 116)p. 164 images [images/371_8.jpg] [“worker”].An epithet of Athena mentioned in Pausanias' Book I, Cap. 24. Cf. Shilleto,Pausanias' Description of Greece, Vol. 1, p. 45)p. 164 images [images/371_9.jpg] [“sound of limbs”].Or, “wholeness of limbs,” implying the general nature of a thing.p. 164 images [images/371_10.jpg] “leading to the end”.In simpler terms, to “be brought to completion.”p. 165 images [images/371_11.jpg] [“making weak”].From Nicomachus' as quoted by Photius, Bibliotheca p.144B. In the sense of“feminine.” Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 798a under images[images/371_12.jpg] Thomas Taylor translated this as “the producing cause offemales.” (Cf. Taylor, Theoretic Arithmetic, p. 204)p. 165 images [images/372_1.jpg] [“guardian of the city”].An epithet of the guardian diety of a city. Cf. images [images/372_2.jpg] inAristophanes, Equites, 581 (Leeuwen, Aristophanes Equites cum prolegomenis etcommentariis, p. 110).p. 165 images [images/372_3.jpg] [“untimely born”].That is, born at the wrong time of the month, or “immature.” Cf. Liddell Scott,A Greek-English Lexicon p. 769b under images [images/372_4.jpg]p. 165 images [images/372_5.jpg] [“stability”].Literally, “security against stumbling or falling.” Used as an epithet ofPoseidon as “The Securer,” who was also associated with the ogdoad. Cf.Plutarch, Theseus, 36: “they pay honors to Poseidon on the eighth day of everymonth. The number eight, as the first cube of an even number and the double ofthe first square, fitly represents the steadfast and immovable power of thisgod, to whom we give the epithets of Securer (images [images/372_6.jpg]) andEarth-stayer.” (Perrin, Plutarch's Lives, Vol. 1 pp. 84-86)p. 165 images [images/372_7.jpg] [“placing in position”].Used with the sense of ‘establishing' and ‘making stable’, being in the properplace.p. 166 images [images/372_8.jpg] [“reconciliation”].Note that this same term is used for the Pentad. (cf. page 159[p3_sec1a_chap9.xhtml#page_159], “ ‘images [images/372_16.jpg] Reconciliation,because the fifth element, Aether, is free from the disturbances of the otherfour.”p. 166 images [images/372_9.jpg] [“far-darting”], because there is no shootingbeyond it.The meaning intended is that it prevents the further progression of number(images [images/372_10.jpg] Theol. Ar. 58-59.) Cf. Ast, TheologumenaArithmeticae, p. 58)p. 166 images [images/372_11.jpg] [“bringing to the end”].Note that this term is also used of the Heptad. See page 164[p3_sec1a_chap11.xhtml#page_164].p. 182 images [images/372_12.jpg] [“preparations”] and images[images/372_13.jpg] [“contact, touch”].'Preparations' in the sense of “musical arrangement.” (Cf. Liddell Scott, AGreek-English Lexicon, p. 587b) Likewise, images [images/372_14.jpg] in thiscase indicates the touch of a hand upon a musical instrument. (Cf. Guthrie, ThePythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 85. Guthrie translated images[images/372_15.jpg] as “readiness.”)p. 184 images [images/373_1.jpg] “work”.Hesiod's poem is fully titled' images [images/373_2.jpg] “Works and Days.”p. 185 images [images/373_3.jpg] “preparedness,” and images [images/373_4.jpg]“musical combination,” and images [images/373_5.jpg] “contact”.Note that images [images/373_6.jpg] is the same word that was discussed in note182 above. Hence, “preparedness” in the sense of musical preparation. So alsoimages [images/373_7.jpg] “musical combination.” (Cf. Liddell Scott, AGreek-English Lexicon, p.1699a). images [images/373_8.jpg] is also discussed innote 201 above, here rendered “contact.This entire section is a quotation taken from Chapter 25 of Iamblicus' Life ofPythagoras: “The Pythagoreans distinguished three states of mind, calledexartysis, or readiness: synarmoge, or fitness, and epaphe, or contact…”(Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 85)Thomas Taylor's translation, with the exception of his reading of the wordimages [images/373_9.jpg] is not only florid, but curiously obtuse: “The wholePythagorean school produced appropriate songs, which they called exartysis oradaptions, synarmoge or elegance of manners, and apaphe or contact…” (Taylor,Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, p. 61)For the Greek text, see Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De VitaPythagorica, Vol. 1, p. 242.p. 185 images [images/373_10.jpg] by charming them.See Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon p. 603a, images [images/373_11.jpg]p. 193 images [images/373_12.jpg]The original text erroneously had images [images/373_14.jpg] “eclipse” insteadof images [images/373_13.jpg] images [images/373_15.jpg] “fall short” (inapplication of areas). Cf. Heath, The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, Vol.2, p. 262 and 427.p. 197images [images/373_16.jpg] the custody of Jupiter.images [images/373_17.jpg] was a Pythagorean term for the center of theUniverse. (Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 1960a, images[images/373_18.jpg] 3.)See Aristotle's “On the heavens” (images [images/373_19.jpg] or De Cxlo) Book 2:“They think (i.e. the Pythagoreans) that the most honourable place belongs tothe most honourable body, and that Fire is more honourable than Earth; that thetwo extremes, centre and circumference, are more honourable than the partsintermediate between them. Upon these grounds, they consider that Fire, and notEarth, is at the centre of the Universal Sphere; and they have another reason,peculier to themselves, for this conclusion: they hold that the centre is themost important place in the universe, and that it ought as such to be the mostcarefully guarded; wherefore they call it the watch of Jupiter (images[images/374_1.jpg]), and regard it as occupied by Fire.” (George Grote,Aristotle, Vol 2, De Cœlo II, Cap. 13, p. 423) For the Greek text of Aristotle,see Bekker, Aristotelis Graece, Vol. 1, p. 293b, 3.p. 200 “ images [images/374_2.jpg] images [images/374_3.jpg] [“theiroppositions, their eclipses, inequalities, eccentricities and epicycles.”]images [images/374_4.jpg] is the anticipation of any planet, either in respectto some other planet, or to the fixed Stars.”This is a difficult passage to translate, as images [images/374_5.jpg] andimages [images/374_6.jpg] may both be used in the sense of “eclipse” or“occultation.” Thomas Taylor translated images [images/374_7.jpg] as“oppositions” which was likewise followed by Guthrie.

For the Greek, see Kiessling, IamblichiChalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 2, p. 72 and for the Greekwith Latin translation, see Nauck, Porphryii Philosophi Platonici Opuscula Tria,p. 30. The latter renders the Greek by the Latin includo, which is more inkeeping with the sense of the word, implying that the voice of the daimon was“confined” or “imprisoned” in the brass. For an English translation, seeGuthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 131.p. 246 images [images/376_3.jpg] [“order”].See Anonymous: Life of Pythagoras Preserved by Photius in Guthrie, ThePythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 139, “It was Pythagoras who first calledheaven kosmos because it is perfect, and “adorned” with infinite beauty andliving beings. In addition to “order,” images [images/376_4.jpg] may also havethe meaning “ornament” or “decoration,” hence the last portion of the sentencein the quotation.p. 254 by divine participation, images [images/376_5.jpg]Read images [images/376_6.jpg] . The quote is from Clement of Alexandria,Stromata V. It is found in Chapter 13. The Greek text reads:images [images/376_7.jpg]“Thus, the Pythagoreans say that the mind (images [images/376_8.jpg]) comes toman by divine providence, as Plato and Aristotle affirm.” The common andaccepted translation of images [images/376_9.jpg] is “divine providence.” Thusalso Xenophon, Memorabilia Book 2, Chapter 3, line 18. (Dindorf, ClementisAlexandrini Opera, Vol. 3, p. 68., Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p.1141a, III., Schneider, Xenophontes Quae Extant, Vol. 4, p. 95)p. 266 and Pindar, speaking of Aesculapius, images [images/376_10.jpg] [“tendingthem”] with soft charms.Aesculapius (Latin) is better known to the modern reader by his Greek nameAsclepius, the god of medicine and healing, described in Pindar's Pythian OdeIII: “Them therefore, whoso came unto him,having self-caused soresor marred in limbs by the polished steel,or far-hurled stone;or wasted in body by summer's fire or winter's cold,he cured, freeing various from various pains;some he fixed healthful,tending them with gentle spells…” (Fennell, Pindar: The Olypian and Pythian Odes, p. 179, Laurent, The Odes ofPindar in English Prose, Vol. 1, p. 155)p. 267 images [images/377_1.jpg]Unfortunately, it is unclear what Stanley understood this phrase to mean, sinceall the authorities declare it to be a corruption. The Greek text given byKiessling is as follows:images [images/377_2.jpg]Kiessling notes that images [images/377_3.jpg] is monstra verborum (an“ill-formed word”), and would restore the passage to: images [images/377_4.jpg]translated as “in euesto aut et aeiesto, id est, tranquillo et constanti animo.”(in euesto (happiness) and aeiesto (everlastingness,) which is, peace andcontinual life”)The critical edition of Ludwig Deubner marks the passage but omits the twowords.The popular editions of Thomas Taylor and Kenneth Guthrie likewise ignore them.(Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, pp.342-344, Taylor, Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, p. xxx, Guthrie, The PythagoreanSourcebook and Library, p.97)pp. 278, who named the more honorable hand images [images/377_5.jpg] the right,not only images [images/377_6.jpg], from receiving; but likewise, images[images/377_7.jpg]images [images/377_8.jpg] from being ready to receive incommunicating.From the Protrepticus of Iamblicus, Chapter 21. Johnson translated this, “whocalled the right hand more excellent than the left, not only because itreceives, but also because it is able to impart.” (Cf. Pistelli, IamblichiProtrepticus Ad Fidem Codicis Florentini, p. 117, Johnson, Iamblicus: TheExhortation to Philosophy, p. 104.)p. 288. In the Twenty eighth, Lay not hold on every one readily with your righthand. Plutarch omits images [images/377_9.jpg], Suidus images[images/377_10.jpg]From the Protrepticus of Iamblicus, Cap. XXI. The Greek reads, images[images/377_11.jpg] images [images/377_12.jpg] which Stanley translates as, “Laynot hold on everyone readily with your right hand.” (i.e. “Do not hasten tooffer everyone your right hand.”)In Suidas' Lexicon, the entry describing this Symbol omits the word images[images/378_1.jpg] and reads:images [images/378_2.jpg] “Do not hasten to offer the right hand.” In Plutarch'sMorals, “On Education,” Chapter 17, it is written as: images [images/378_3.jpg]images [images/378_4.jpg] “Do not offer everyone your right hand,” omitting theword images [images/378_9.jpg] from the account of Pythagoras' Symbol. ThisSymbol is recounted in full by Diogenes Laertius in his Lives of EminentPhilosophers, Chapter VIII, 17, which Hicks translated liberally, “don't shakehands too eagerly,” but which effectively sums up the actual meaning of thesentence. (Cf. Pistelli, Iamblichi Protrepticus Ad Fidem Codicis Florentini, p.108, Bekker, Suidae Lexicon, p. 910a., Vernardakis, Plutarchi ChaeronensisMoralia, Vol. 1, p. 28, Shilleto, Plutarch's Morals, Ethical Essays, p. 18., andHicks, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Vol. 2, p. 337.)p. 289 This last reason is confirmed by Plutarch, who explains this Symbol:Abstain from Suffrages; which of old were given by Beans.In Liberis Educandis (On the training of children), Plutarch wrote, “Abstainfrom beans”; means that a man should keep out of politics, for beans were usedin earlier times for voting upon the removal of magistrates from office.”(Babbitt, Plutarch, Moralia, Vol. 1., Chap. 17) This process is described byRobert Bateman Paul as follows:“when [the assembly] deprived the magistrates of their power formaladministration, they gave their votes in private. The manner of votingprivately was by casting pebbles (images [images/378_5.jpg]) into vessels,(images [images/378_6.jpg]) which the prytanes [i.e. officers in the Senate]were obliged to place in the assembly for this purpose. Before the use ofpebbles, they voted with beans (images [images/378_7.jpg]) As soon as the peoplehad done voting, the proëdri [i.e. other officers of the Senate], havingcarefully examined the number of suffrages, pronounced the decree ratified orthrown out, according as the majority part approved or rejected it.” (R.B. Paul,The Antiquities of Greece, p.228.) Beans were also used in this manner forcasting judgments against defendants on trial, as well as voting for Senators.“The Senators were elected by lots in the following manner: on a certain day,before the beginning of the month Hecatombæon, the president of every tribe gavein the names of all the persons within his district who were capable of thisdignity, and chose to be candidates for it. These were engraven on tables ofbrass, called images [images/378_8.jpg] and cast into a vessel set there forthat purpose. Into another vessel were cast the same number of beans, fifty ofwhich were white, and all the rest black. Then the names of the candidates andthe beans were drawn out one by one; and those whose names were drawn outtogether with the white beans were elected for that tribe.” (Ibid, p. 229)p. 291. images [images/379_1.jpg] [“testicles (and) genitals”]Read, images [images/379_2.jpg] From Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras, Chapter 43.(Cf. Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol.2, p. 76, and Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 132.)p. 291 images [images/379_3.jpg] GenerationStanley translates images [images/379_4.jpg] as “Generation,” instead of theliteral “testicles and genitals”.p. 312. images [images/379_5.jpg] He said.See page 373 [add_note.xhtml#page_373] above, note to page 99[p1_chap20.xhtml#page_99].p. 312. Thus the Cabalists answer images [images/379_6.jpg] The wise said; andChristians, images [images/379_7.jpg] Believe.The phrase, images [images/379_8.jpg] (ameru hakamim) “the sages say,” wastranslated by Reuchlin in Latin as dixerunt sapientes, read by Stanley as “thewise said.” The phrase is found, for example, in some of the Midrashim, such asthe Midrash ‘Aseret Ha-Dibrot, and the Midrash Vayosha where the authorsintroduced subject matter without feeling the necessity to quote their sources,intitiating significant sections with, ameru hakamim, “the sages say…”In speaking of the corresponding Christian admonition “Believe,” Reuchlin was inturn quoting Gregory of Nazienzus' First Invective Against Julian, Chapter 102,where Gregory says of Julian:“Ours,” says he, “are the words and speaking of Greek, whose right it is toworship the gods; yours are the want of words, and clownishness, and nothingbeyond the faith in your own doctrine.” At this, those I fancy will not laugh,who follow the sect of Pythagoras amongst you, with whom the images[images/379_9.jpg] “ is the first and greatest of articles of faith; andpreferable to the “Golden (perhaps Leaden) Words.” For after that preliminaryand much celebrated training of Silence of such as were initiated into hisdoctrine (in order that they might be trained in bridling speech by dint ofholding their tongues), it was the rule, ‘tis said, that when questioned aboutany one of his tenets, they replied in explanation, when the reason was asked,that it had been so decreed by Pythagoras himself: and that the reason of thedoctrine was what had come into that sage's head, without proof, andunquestioned. Thus your “He said so” comes to the same thing with our “Believe,”but in other syllables and terms, although you never give over ridiculing andabusing the latter. For our saying means that it is not allowable to disbelievethings said by divinely-inspired persons, but that the proof of the Word istheir trustworthiness, a thing more convincing than any logical argument ordefense.”(Goodman, Johann Reuchlin On the Art of the Kabbalah, pp. 144-147, King, C.W.Julian the Emperor containing Gregory Nazianzen's Two Invectives and Libanius'Monody, pp. 68-69)p. 317. That is the IDEA (from images [images/380_1.jpg]), [“seeing, meaningunderstanding”]Stanley is paraphrasing Reuchlin's De Arte Cabalistica here, but the Greek as hegives it is problematical. The Reuchlin text has images [images/380_2.jpg]images [images/380_3.jpg] “ from seeing (images [images/380_4.jpg]), meaningunderstanding (images [images/380_5.jpg]).” Stanley has structured hisparenthetical note in such a way that images [images/380_7.jpg] appears only asa gloss on images [images/380_6.jpg], apparently intending to emphasize thatIDEA is derived from images [images/380_8.jpg], adding images[images/380_10.jpg] as an explanation or definition of images [images/380_9.jpg]It is unclear why Stanley did not simply quote Reuchlin verbatum. (Cf. Goodman,Johann Reuchlin, On the Art of the Kabbalah. De Arte Cabalistica, p. 152-153.)p. 318 Empedocles images [images/380_17.jpg] “strife”Stanley is closely paraphrasing Reuchlin here, but he supplies the Greek termwhere Reuchlin remains in Latin. The doctrine of Empedocles asserted thatcreation and destruction were impossible, but that which appeared to be eitherof these arises from the union or separation of the four eternal elements ofAir, Earth, Fire and Water. The unifying principle was signifed by images[images/380_11.jpg] “love,” while the separative principle was its oppositeimages [images/380_12.jpg], “strife” or “contention,” the latter being a synonymof images [images/380_13.jpg] .images [images/380_14.jpg] images [images/380_15.jpg] “O mortal kind! O ye poorsons of grief! From such contentions and such sighings sprung!”—Empedocles,124.2.(Leonard, The Fragments of Empedocles, p. 57)p. 322 Having overcome these things (says Pythagoras) thou shalt know images[images/380_18.jpg] the cohabitation of the immortal gods, and mortal men.This quote is a short paraphrase of Reuchlin, whose longer version closelyfollows the Golden Verses: “from Pythagoras, who wrote in the the Golden Verses:‘When you cast aside the body you come to the free aether, you will be a god andimmortal. When the things of this life are overcome, you will know the dwellingtogether (which he elegantly termed images [images/380_16.jpg] because they‘stand together’) of immortal gods and mortal men.”Reuchlin was quoting from two different places within the Golden Verses. Thefirst portion of the quote is the last two lines of the Golden Verses: “Thenshould you be separated from the body, and soar in the aethyr. You will beimperishable, a divinity, a mortal no more.” (Guthrie, The PythagoreanSourcebook, p. 165). The second portion of the quote is lines 49-51: “If thisyou hold fast, soon will you recognize of Gods and mortal men.” (Ibid, p. 164.)For the Greek text, see Gaisford, Poetæ Minories Gracæ Vol. 3, pp.282-283.

And laughter unquenchablearose amid the blessed gods to see Hephaistos bustling through the palace.”(Lang, Leaf & Meyers.

Greek text in Gainsford,Poetæ Minories Gracæ. Vol. 3, p. 283.)p. 327 Thus is man placed between Virtue and Vice, like the stalk between thetwo branches in the Pythagorical Y.“In this way, man seems poised between virtue and vice. This brings to mind thePythagorean letter “Y,” with its upright split into two branches.” (Goodman,Johann Reuchlin, On the Art of the Kabbalah. De Arte Cabalistica, p. 167)p. 327 Tartarus, by those who endure infinite torments, images[images/381_3.jpg] images [images/381_4.jpg] (as Plato, imitating Pythagoras,says) whence they never come out.From Plato's Phaedra: “But those who appear to be incurable, on account of thegreatness of their wrong-doings, because they have committed many great deeds ofsacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders, or any other such crimes, are castby their fitting destiny into Tartarus, whence they never emerge (images[images/381_5.jpg]).(Fowler, Plato, Vol. 1, Phaedo,62, p. 388-389) Reuchlin believed this passagefrom Phaedo was a direct quote from Pythagoras. (Goodman, Johann Reuchlin, Onthe Art of the Kabbalah. De Arte Cabalistica, p. 168-169.)

(Kiessling,Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1, p.24)p. 337 note 25. The manuscript of Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras gives the nameCleanthes (images [images/381_10.jpg]) as the source of these accounts, andStanley is quoting it correctly. However, scholars now affirm that the word is amisspelling for Neanthes (images [images/381_11.jpg]). Edouard Zeller, in AHistory of Greek Philosophy from the earliest period to the time of Socrates,Vol. 1, p. 329: “The Cleanthes of Porphyry is certainly not the Stoic but mostlikely a misspelling for Neanthes (of Cyzicus).” Guthrie likewise modifiesCleanthes to Neanthes (The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 123).

For images [images/383_1.jpg] reading images [images/383_2.jpg]images [images/383_3.jpg] etc.Stanley offered an emendation to Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, Cap. 3 whichreads: images [images/383_4.jpg] Thomas Taylor translated the original text, “hesaid nothing more than, ‘Are you bound for Egypt?’” (Kiessling, IamblichiChalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1, p.44. Taylor,Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, p. 8. Cf. Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook andLibrary, p. 60)p. 340 note 98. images [images/383_5.jpg]. Hesych. images [images/383_6.jpg]images [images/383_7.jpg].The earliest edition of Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras that was available toconsult, the 1630 edition by Cardinal Barberinus, does not concur with Stanley,but gives the reading images [images/383_8.jpg]. Likewise, the 1731 Latinedition of Stanley's History of Philosophy notes that Stanley wrote images[images/383_13.jpg] instead of images [images/383_14.jpg] which is in thepublished text of Porphyry. “The later editions of Kiessling and Nauck likewiseread images [images/383_9.jpg] images [images/383_10.jpg], “in the place calledTripod.” Guthrie follows Kiessling and Nauck, translating the entire passagequoted by Stanley:“At Delphi he inscribed an elegy on the tomb of Apollo, declaring that Apollowas the son of Silenus, but was slain by Pytho, and buried in the place called“Tripod,” so named from the local mourning for Apollo by the three daughters ofTriopas.”Stanley's reference “Hesychius’, images [images/383_11.jpg] images[images/383_12.jpg].” refers to the Lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria, where itis said that Triops for the Pythagoreans signified the Tripod of Delphi.(Barberinus, Porphyrii Philosophi Liber De Vita Pythagoræ, pp. 10-11, Kiessling,Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 2, p. 30, Nauck,Porphryii Philosophi Platonici Opuscula Tria, p. 20, Guthrie, The PythagoreanSourcebook and Library, p. 126. Cf. Schmidt, Hesychii Alexandrini Lexicon,Editionem Minorem, p. 1472)p. 340 note 122. Cicero's reference to this event in his Tusculan Disputations,Book I, Chapter 4, is quite brief: “Pythagoras…came into Italy in the reign ofTarquin the proud.”Cicero referred to Pythagoras' arrival in Italy with more detail in histreatise, On the Commonwealth, Book 2, Chapter 15: “For it was not till thefourth year of the reign of Tarquinius Superbus that Pythagoras is ascertainedto have come to Sybaris, Crotona, and this part of Italy.” (Yonge, Cicero'sTusculan Disputations; also treatises on the nature of the gods and on theCommonwealth, pp. 25 & 406.)p. 340 note 127. Eusebius, ChroniconStanley's footnote to the English edition does not identify the specific source,but merely indicates that it is from a work by Eusebius. The Latin edition ofThe History of Philosophy clearly identifies the source as the Chronicon or“Chronicle” of Eusebius. The original Greek for the Eusebius' Chronicon is lostand it is known only through an early Latin translation by Justin. However, inthe year 1616 the scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger published an edition of theChronicon under the title Thesaurus Temporum: Eusebii Pamphili CaesareaePalaestinae Episcopi, Chronicorum Canonum Omnimodae Historiae, in which heattempted to restore the Greek of Eusebius, relying heavily upon the Latintranslation of Justin. In Stanley's time, this work was acknowledged as a veryimportant work, and was widely read. It is probable that this was the workuntilized by Thomas Stanley for referencing the Greek Olympiads.p. 341 note 146. images [images/384_1.jpg] quasi images [images/384_2.jpg],[‘Muse’, practically the same as ‘Music'] Synessius in Dion, Chap. 5 &Cassiodorus, Variarum, Liber II, 40.Synessius, the Neo-Platonic philosopher who became the Bishop of Kyrenaica, inhis work Dion, writes about Dio Cocceianus of Prusa, also known as Chrysostom,“goldvoice.” Dio was a Greek philosopher and politician, considered by many tobe one of the first representatives of the Second Sophistic movement of Greece.Synessius argues that Dio converted from sophism to philosophy. In Chapter 5 ofDion, Synessius extols the usefulness of the arts of the Muses, suggesting thatwhile the Muses inspire a variety of arts, the philosopher harmonizes them intoone. The passage in full reads:“Now this speech would define as an artist and an expert the man who cuts offfor himself any one branch of knowledge, one such man belonging to one divinity(daimon), another to another; but it would call philosopher that one who hasbeen fitted together from the harmony of all, and has made the multitude of artsinto one. Or rather he has not attained this yet, for this must be added to himalso, namely, that he have a task of his own superior to that of his company.Thus the story goes that Apollo sings at one time with the Muses, leading offhimself, and giving the time to the band, and at another sings by himself; butthe first would be the sacred and ineffable melody. So our philosopher willcommune, now with himself, and now with the god through philosophy, but he willcommune with men by the subordinate powers of speech. He will possess knowledgeindeed as a lover of literature, whereas he will pass judgment upon each andeverything as a philosopher. But these immovable men who despise rhetoric andpoetry do not seem to me to be what they are of their own free will, and owingto the poverty of their natural gifts they are incapable of even smallachievements. You may more easily see such men than see anything in their minds,and their tongues are unable to interpret any thought.”(Migne, Patrologiæ Cursus Completus, Series Græca. Vol. 66. images[images/385_1.jpg], p. 1125-1128, and Fitzgerald, The Letters of Synesius ofCyrene: Translated into English with introduction and notes)Cassiodorus in Liber II, Letter 40 of his Variarum wrote concerning music:“Reflections on the nature of music. She is the Queen of the senses; when shecomes forth from her secret abiding place all other thoughts are cast out. Hercuratiave influence on the soul. The five tones: the Dorian, influencing tomodesty and purity; the Phrygian to fierce combat; the Aeolian to tranquilityand slumber; the Ionian (Jastius) , which sharpens the intellect of the dull andkindles the desire of heavenly things; the Lydian, which soothes the souloppressed with too many cares. We distinguish the highest, middle and lowest ineach tone, obtaining thus in all fifteen tones of artificial music. The diapasonis collected from all, and unites all their virtues.Classical instances of music: Orpheus. Amphion. Musaeus.The human voice was an instrument of music. Oratory and Poesy as branches of theart.The power of song: Ulysses and the Sirens. David, the author of the Psalter, whoby his melody three times drove away the evil spirit from Saul. The lyre iscalled ‘Chorda' because it so easily moves the hearts (corda) of men. As thediadem dazzles by the variegated luster of its gems, so the lyre with itsdiverse sounds. The lyre, the loom of the Muses.

The missing text from Laertius is as follows:images [images/386_1.jpg].“Timaeus, in the tenth book of his Histories, tells us, that he used to say thatwomen who were married to men had the names of the Gods, being successivelycalled Virgins, then Nymphs, and subsequently Mothers.” (Hicks, DiogenesLaertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Vol. 2, p. 330 and Yonge, DiogenesLaertius, The Lives And Opinions of Eminent Philosophers p. 342.)p. 341 note 157.

So read, [Pyrrhus], not Pythius.The Scholiast of Sophocles incorrectly rendered the name images[images/386_4.jpg], thus Stanley's note.(Cf. Mobeim, Marcus. Diogenes Laertii De Vitis, Dogmatibus et ApophthegmatibusClarorum Philosophorum, p. 491)p. 343 note 194. images [images/386_5.jpg], ill rendered, amicorum inopia [“lackof friends”.]Stanley's note means that the Greek text of Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras,images [images/386_6.jpg], should be rendered as “want of necessities” ratherthan the Latin translation amicorum inopia, “lack of friends.” The 1630 editionof Cardinal Barberinus', Porphyrii Philosophi Liber De Vita Pythagoræ p. 39translates the Greek by the Latin amicorum inopia, the phrase Stanley findsfaulty. Likewise, the Eighteenth century translation of Kiessling, IamblichiChalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 2, p. 93, retains thereading amicorum inopia. The Greek text reads:images [images/387_1.jpg]Guthrie's version has, “Pythagoras fled to the temple of the Muses, inMetapontum. There he abode forty days, and starving, died.” (Guthrie, ThePythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 134)p. 343 note 198. Ibid, Chap. 2“fair-haired Samian,” images [images/387_2.jpg], was correctly translated“long-haired Samian” by Taylor and Guthrie. (Cf.

Liddell-Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 975a., Kiessling,Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, p. 30.)p. 343 note 225. Perhaps images [images/387_3.jpg], etc.Stanley's original marginal note reads verbatum with the text of Laertius.Cf. Huebner, Diogenis Laertii De Vitis, Dogmatis Et Apophthegmatis ClarorumPhilosophorum Libri Decem, Vol. 2, p. 276 and Yonge, Diogenes Laertius, TheLives And Opinions of Eminent Philosophers p. 355 : “Telauges, noble youth, whomin due time, Theano bore to wise Pythagoras.”p.344 note 235. images [images/387_4.jpg] “poor workmanship,” images[images/387_5.jpg] “mischevious art.From Laertius Chapter 5:' images [images/387_6.jpg] Yonge translated it, “Now,some people say that Pythagoras did not leave behind him a single book; but theytalk foolishly; for Heraclitus, the natural philosopher, speaks plainly enoughof him saying, ‘Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, was the most learned of allmen in history; and having selected from these writings, he thus formed his ownwisdom, and extensive learning, and mischevious art” (Yonge, Diogenes Laertius,The Lives And Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, p. 340) Compare the version ofHicks: “There are some who insist, absurdly enough, that Pythagoras left nowritings whatever. At all events, Heraclitus, the physicist, almost shouts inour ear, “Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised inquiry beyond all other men,and in this selection of his writings made himself a wisdom of his own, showingmuch learning, but poor workmanship.” (Hicks, Diogenes Laertius Lives of EminentPhilosophers, Vol 2 pp. 324-325). Cf. Huebner Diogenis Laertii De Vitis,Dogmatis Et Apophthegmatis Clarorum Philosophorum Libri Decem, Vol. 2, p. 242.“sometimes taken in a good sense; Gregory Nazianzus, Adversus Julianus, Oratio4. images [images/388_1.jpg]the text being so to be restored.”(Cf. Migne, Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Gregorius Nazianzenus Vol. XXXV,Contra Julianum imperatorem, Cap.112, 87-88. p. 649. Note that the Greek issignificantly different from that given by Stanley: images [images/388_2.jpg]Cf. King, Julian the Emperor containing Gregory Nazianzen's Two Invectives andLibanius' Monody, p. 75 where images [images/388_3.jpg] was rendered“treacherous intention.” Stanley's suggestion that the word is sometimes takenin a “good sense” would appear to be dependent on his own restoration andinterpretation of the text of Nazianzus, not followed by other authorities.p. 344 note 238. images [images/388_4.jpg] “bear ill-will.” The original Ms. ofDiogenes Laertius' Lives of Eminent Philosophers has images [images/388_5.jpg],which was copied by Stanley. Hicks rendered the phrase “suffer censure” Yongetranslated it, “be blamed.”(For images [images/388_6.jpg] see Liddel Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon underimages [images/388_7.jpg]. Cf. Hicks, Diogenes Laertius Lives of EminentPhilosophers, Vol 2 p. 325. Yonge, Diogenes Laertius, The Lives And Opinions ofEminent Philosophers, p. 340)p. 345 note 259. For images [images/388_8.jpg] perhaps read images[images/388_9.jpg]. The Greek text of Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras Cap. 19, 77reads: images [images/388_10.jpg] images [images/388_11.jpg]. Kiessling alsonoted that images [images/388_12.jpg], “art, craft,” is corrupt in this context.(Cf. Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1, p.200-201) The sentence requires the meaning of “mark” or “sign,” henceKiessling's Latin translation Etiam alia similia potentiae Abaradis vestigiamemorantur. “Many other such signs of the power of Abaris were reported.”p. 346 note 297. For images [images/388_13.jpg] reading, images[images/388_14.jpg], “Thus, as said by Plato….”From Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, Chapter 16, the passage in full reads:images [images/389_1.jpg]“By all these inventions, therefore, he divinely healed and purified the soul,resuscitated and saved its divine part, and conducted to the intelligible itsdivine eye, which, as Plato says, is better worth saving than ten thousandcorporeal eyes.”The reference to Plato is from his Republic, Book VII, Chapter X, where in thedialogue, the argument is made that the study of science and mathematics, whiledifficult, enlightens the soul: “that by these branches of study some organ ofthe soul in each individual is purified and rekindled like fire, after havingbeen destroyed and blinded by other kinds of study–an organ, indeed, betterworth saving than ten-thousand eyes, since by that alone truth can be seen.”This same passage from Plato is also quoted by Nicomachus in his Introduction ToArithmetic (Chapter 3) as a defense of the four sciences of Arithmetic,Geometry, Music and Astronomy.(Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1,p. 148. Taylor, Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, p. 37. Burges, Works of Plato,Vol. 2, p. 217. D'Ooge, Introduction to Arithmetic, by Nicomachus of Gerasa (pp.181-190))p. 346 note 308. For images [images/389_2.jpg], “savage Aenean” perhaps readimages [images/389_3.jpg]images [images/389_4.jpg] “Agrinean.”Kiessling (Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1 p.188) mentions the option images [images/389_5.jpg] (rusticus Aeneus) butsuggested images [images/389_6.jpg] “Aegean” and rendered the Latin, HippomedonAegeus, “Hippomedon the Aegean.” Thomas Taylor rendered it “Hippomedon, anAegean.” (Taylor, Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, p.46) Cf. Guthrie, ThePythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p. 79. Stanley himself lists Hippomedon asone of the Aegeans. (See page 113 [p1_chap24.xhtml#page_113].)p. 346 note 310. For images [images/389_7.jpg], perhaps read images[images/389_8.jpg]. Yet Laertius expressly saith, that linen was not as yet usedin those parts.The reference to the linen garment is from Iamblicus, Life of Pythagoras, Cap.21. Kiessling also corrected the reading to images [images/389_9.jpg], “linengarment,” Diogenes Laertius however wrote: images [images/389_10.jpg] images[images/390_1.jpg]“His robe was white and spotless, his quilts of white wool,for linen had not yet reached those parts.”(Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 1,p. 216. Hicks, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Vol. 2, pp.336-337.)p. 346 note 312. From Iamblichus restore Diodorus in Excerpta Valesiana page 245[p3_sec3a_chap2.xhtml#page_245]. reading images [images/390_2.jpg]The fragment from Excerpta Valesiana refers to a fragment of Diodorus Siculus'Bibliotheca Historica, originally published by Henricus Valesius in 1636. Thetext may be found in Dindorf, images [images/390_3.jpg] images[images/390_4.jpg] Diodori Bibliotheca Historica, Vol. 2, p. 166, where theactual fragment from Liber X, Chapter 5, Section 1 reads:…images [images/390_5.jpg]…Stanley's restoration comes from Iamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, Chapter 29. Cf.Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. I,page 350 [endnote.xhtml#page_350] line 166: images [images/390_6.jpg]. “theability of remembering was most important for experience, science and wisdom.”See also Booth, The Historical Library of Diodorus The Sicilian in Fifteen Booksto which are added The Fragments of Diodorus and Those published by H. Valesius,I. Rhodomannus, and F. Ursinus, Vol. 2 page 576 (No. 38). Where the entirepassage of the fragment from Diodorus translated reads, “The Pythagoreans had agreat art in improving their memories, and to that end employed their utmostcare and diligence. For the first thing they did constantly after they rose fromtheir beds in a morning, was to recollect and call to mind every thing they haddone the day before, from the morning to the evening; if if they had time andleisure, they would go back to examine the actions of the second, third, andfourth days, and sometimes farther, conceiving it very helpful and advantageousfor improving the memory, and increasing knowledge.” From this, one can see thatStanley drew heavily on Diodorus for the text immediately preceding the note,and adding from Iamblicus.p. 347 note 323. images [images/390_7.jpg].Also rendered the same by Friedlein, Procli Diadochi In Primum EuclidisElementorum Librum Commentarii, p. 36. ‘Barocius' refers to Franciscus Barocius(the Latin name of Francesco Barozzi) who published a translation of Euclid'sElements in Venice in the year 1560.p. 347 note 324. images [images/391_1.jpg]Freidlein read this passage images [images/391_2.jpg] images [images/391_3.jpg].(Friedlein, Procli Diadochi In Primum Euclidis Elementorum Librum Commentarii,p. 36)p. 347 note 326. images [images/391_4.jpg] “Introduction to Arithmetic” Thesubsequent text, “so supply the Title, as a page. 30. 35. 44. 62. 76) cap. 4.refers to the Greek images [images/391_4.jpg] which is the title of the book byNicomachus by that name, known by its Latin name Introductionis Arithmeticae. InChapter 3, Nicomachus quotes Plato's Republic, Book VII, Chapter X, wherein thefour mathemata of the quadrivium (the “higher subjects”—Arithmetic, Geometry,Music and “Spheric,” i.e. Astronomy) are described and defended: “arithmetic forreckoning, distributions, contributions, exchanges and partnerships, geometryfor sieges, the founding of cities and sanctuaries, and the partition of land,music for festivals, entertainment, and the worship of the gods, and thedoctrine of the spheres, or astronomy, for farming, navigation and otherundertaking, revealing beforehand the proper procedure and suitable season.”Chapter 4 of Nicomachus' “Introduction to Arithmetic” clarifies the reasoning toselect Arithmetic as the first of the four methods (Music, Mathematics, Geometryor Spheric) should be studied first. The Chapter is given in full below:“Which then of these four methods must we first learn? Evidently, the one whichnaturally exists before them all, is superior and takes the place of origin androot and, as it were, of mother to the others. And this is arithmetic, notsolely because we said that it existed before all the others in the mind of thecreating God like some universal and exemplary plan, relying upon which as adesign and archetypal example the creator of the universe sets in order hismaterial creations and makes them attain to their proper ends; but also becauseit is naturally prior in birth inasmuch as it abolishes other sciences withitself, but is not abolished together with them. For example, ‘animal' isnaturally antecedent to ‘man,’ for abolish ‘animal' and ‘man' is abolished; butif ‘man' be abolished, it no longer follows that ‘animal' is abolished at thesame time. And again, ‘man' is antecedent to ‘schoolteacher,’ but if‘schoolteacher' is nonexistent, it is still possible for ‘man' to be. Thus sinceit has the property of abolishing the other ideas with itself, it is likewisethe older. Conversely, that is called younger and posterior which implies theother thing with itself, but is not implied by it, like ‘musician,’ for thisalways implies ‘man.’ Again, take ‘horse’; ‘animal' is always implied along with‘horse,’ but not the reverse; for if ‘animal' exists, it is not necessary that‘horse' should exist, nor if ‘man' exists, must ‘musician' also be implied. Soit is with the foregoing sciences; if geometry exists, arithmetic must alsoneeds be implied, for it is with the help of this latter that we can speak oftriangle, quadrilateral, octahedron, icosahedron, double, eightfold, or one andone-half times, or anything else of the sort which is used as a term bygeometry, and such things cannot be conceived of without the numbers that areimplied with each one. For how can ‘triple' exist, or be spoken of, unless thenumber 3 exists beforehand, or ‘eightfold' without 8? But on the contrary, 3, 4,and the rest might be without the figures existing to which they give names.Hence arithmetic abolishes geometry along with itself, but is not abolished byit, and while it is implied by geometry, it does not itself imply geometry.”(Hoche, images [images/392_1.jpg]images [images/392_2.jpg], Nicomachi GeraseniPythagorei Introductionis Arithmeticae, pp. 9-10, D'Ooge, Introduction toArithmetic, by Nicomachus of Gerasa (pp. 181-190)p. 347 note 342. Eustratius, Ethica Nicomachea.1 & Servius, Incipit ExpositioPrimae Eclogae, VIII.Cf. Virgil, Ecologue VIII:“Threefold first I twine about thee these diverse triple-hued threads, andthrice round these altars I draw thine image: an odd number is god's delight.”(McKail, The Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil, p. 29)p. 354 note 599. Meibomius seems to mistake the meaning of images[images/392_3.jpg]images [images/392_4.jpg], and therefore puts a point afterimages [images/392_5.jpg].The quote is from Nicomachus' ‘Manual of Harmonics' (APMONIKON ETXEIPIimages[images/t.png]ION).Marcus Meibom, in the Greek text of his Nicomachi Harmonices p. 10 in AntiquaeMusicae, Vol. 1, erroneously places a period after images [images/392_6.jpg].The correct Greek text is supplied by Jan, Musici Scriptoris Graeci p. 245,given below with a translation by Mike Estell:images [images/392_7.jpg]“After the interval of four chords, that of five chords, and that by the joiningof both, call diapason, and the tone added between the two four-chord intervals,were confirmed to have this numerical quantity, in some such manner seized uponby Pythagoras.”Whereas Meibom has images [images/392_8.jpg], Jan's text from Musici ScriptorisGraeci correctly gives images [images/392_9.jpg], which is the masculine dativewith the final letter being iota, not alpha. The word is the aorist passiveparticiple of images [images/393_1.jpg], “seize, catch” or “constrain.” In thesentence above, images [images/393_2.jpg] modifies the phrase images[images/393_3.jpg], “in some such manner.” It refers to the manner in whichPythagoras came to establish the numerical quantity of intervals with themusical chords, which he “seized upon.” The phrase, “in some such manner,”refers to the following sentence which describes Pythagoras' trip to theBlacksmith shop. As Stanley observes, Meibom mistakes the meaning, or functionin the sentence, of images [images/393_4.jpg], not understanding it to modifyimages [images/393_5.jpg], but apparently relating back to the phrase “the toneadded between the two four-chord intervals,” with a meaning something akin to“comprehended.” images [images/393_6.jpg] can mean “to seize with the mind,comprehend, understand,” and this may have been the basis of his error. Theperiod following images [images/393_7.jpg] may not be related to this error atall, and may just be a simple misprint in the Greek text printed by Meibom. Hedoes not insert a period in the middle of the Latin text as he does in theGreek.(For the Greek translation and scholarly commentary on this difficult passageabove, we are indebted to Mike Estell.)P. 355 note 605. images [images/393_8.jpg], Meibomius otherwise.The quotation is from Nicomachus' Harmonicum Enchiridium, which is verbatum withIamblicus' Life of Pythagoras, Chapter 26:images [images/393_9.jpg] images [images/393_10.jpg]. “After carefully examiningthe weights of the hammers and their impacts, which were identical, he wenthome.” Marcus Meibom had the correct Greek images [images/393_11.jpg] but hisLatin translation, intra se est conversus, “he returned by himself,” is faulty,hence Stanley's note. Kiessling rendered it domum rediit, “he returned home.”(Meibom, Nicomachi Harmonices p. 11 in Antiquae Musicae Vol. 1, Jan, MusiciScriptoris Graeci, p. 246., Levin, The Manual of Harmonics of Nicomachus thePythagorean, p.83, Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De VitaPythagorica, Vol. 1, p. 248.)p. 355 note 606. images [images/393_12.jpg], which Meibomius, contrary to allMSS. Would change unnecessarily into images [images/393_13.jpg] and rendersaeque graves.In the main body of the text Meibom printed images [images/393_14.jpg] which iscorrect. In his notes to the text on p. 48 however, he discussed images[images/393_15.jpg] “in balance” and images [images/393_16.jpg] “equal inweight” in support of his Latin translation aeque graves (equal weight). Theword images [images/393_17.jpg] means literally “equally twisted,” and refers tothe ropes. (See Meibom, Nicomachi Harmonices pp. 11 and 48 in Antiquae MusicaeVol. 1, and Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 839b under images[images/393_18.jpg].)p. 355 note 617. images [images/394_1.jpg].Kiessling read it as images [images/394_2.jpg].

For the Latintext, Cf. Hultsch, CENSORINI, DE DIE NATALI LIBER pp. 22-24.”p. 358 note 727. “Perhaps images [images/394_4.jpg] images [images/394_5.jpg].See St. Basil of Caesarea, Homilia ad Psalm. XIX.”The quotation is from from Basil's images [images/394_6.jpg]images[images/394_7.jpg], To young men on how they might profit from Greek Literature.(“Greek Literature” is alternately translated, “Pagan Literature” or “ProfaneWorks”) In Migne's Patrologiæ Cursus Completus, Series Græca. Vol. 31 this workis listed as one of the Sermons, and falls between Homily 21 and 23. The 24thHomily is Contra Sabellianos, et Arium, et Anomæos. The entire quote, with abetter restoration, reads:images [images/394_8.jpg]“And it will be remembered of Pythagoras, that calling one of his familiars fromthe gymnastics and eating, which were fattening him very much, he said, ‘Willyou not cease making your imprisonment harder for yourself?” (Jacks, St. Basiland Greek Literature, p. 45) These words of Pythagoras were assigned by Stobaeusto Plato (Serm. 77)For the Greek text see Migne, Patrologiæ Cursus Completus, Series Græca. Vol.31, pp. 583-584, or for Greek text with another translation, Cf. Defarrari,Saint Basil: The Letters & Address To Young Men On Reading Greek Literature,Vol. 4, pp. 422-423.The final portion of the note refers to St. Basil of Caesarea's, Homilia adPsalm. XXIX, which contains the following condemnation of gluttony:“On the other hand, what is uglier or more disgusting than a soul given over tobase passions? Look at the hot-headed person: he is like a wild beast. Considerthe slave of lust or gluttony: who can bear the sight of him?” (PG 29, 316)p. 358 note 727. “Reading images [images/395_9.jpg] according to Stobaeus,Florilegium 99, who cites this fragment but of Aristoxenus; perhaps it belongedto his Book, De Vitae Pythagorae.”See above, page 373 [add_note.xhtml#page_373], note to page 99[p1_chap20.xhtml#page_99]. By images [images/395_1.jpg], Stanley means images[images/395_2.jpg] images [images/395_3.jpg], “He said it,” referring toPythagoras, since Stobaeus credits the source as Aristoxenus, but relates it asa quotation from Pythagoras himself.p. 360 note 787. Laertius, De Vitis Philosophorum, Liber I, Life of Pittacus,Chap. 8.The “Epigram of Callimachus upon Pittacus” is in full, as follows:'Hyrradius' prudent son, old PittacusThe pride of Mitylene, once was askedBy an Atarnean stranger; “Tell me, sage,I have two marriages proposed to me;One maid my equal is in birth and riches;The other's far above me; which is best?Advise me now which shall I take to wife?”Thus spoke the stranger; but the aged prince,Raising his old man's staff before his face,Said, “These will tell you all you want to know;”And pointed to some boys, who with quick lashesWere driving whipping tops along the street.“Follow their steps,” said he; so he went near themAnd heard them say, “Let each now mind his own.”—So when the stranger heard the boys speak thus,He pondered on their words, and laid asideAmbitious thoughts of an unequal marriage.As then he took to shame the poorer bride,So too do you, O reader, mind thy own.’(Yonge, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, p. 37)p. 361 note 830. These are termed images [images/395_4.jpg] [“intelligence”],images [images/395_5.jpg] [“reason”], images [images/395_6.jpg] [“passion”].images [images/395_7.jpg] [“intelligence”] and images [images/395_6.jpg][“passion”] are in other living creatures, images [images/395_5.jpg] [“reason”],only in man.images [images/395_8.jpg]“The soul of man, he says, is divided into three parts: intelligence, reason,and passion. Intelligence and passion are possessed by other animals as well,but reason by man alone.” (Hicks, Diogenes Laertius, Lives of EminentPhilosophers, Vol. 2, p. 347)p. 361 note 831. images [images/396_1.jpg] They talk, but cannot speak.For the Greek text, see Wyttenbach, images [images/396_2.jpg] images[images/396_3.jpg] PLUTARCHI CHÆRONENSIS MORALIA, Vol. 4, part 2, p. 668. images[images/396_4.jpg] means “inarticulate speech” or “chatter.” (Cf. the reading byVernardakis, Plutarchi Chaeronensis Moralia, Vol. 5, p. 364.)p. 361 note 835. Anonymous, De Vita Pythagorae apud Photius, Chap. 10. Forimages [images/396_5.jpg] [“Twelve”], perhaps images [images/396_6.jpg] [“ten”].The Greek text in the Anonymous De Vita Pythagorae preserved by Photius, Chapter10 reads:images [images/396_7.jpg]“According to Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle, sight is the judge of the twelvecolors, white and black being the extremes of those in between: yellow, tawny,pale, red, blue, green, light blue, and gray”.One would expect a list of twelve colors to follow, however only ten colors aregiven. Thus Stanley corrects the text from “twelve” (images [images/396_5.jpg])to “ten” (images [images/396_6.jpg].)(Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 2,pp. 106-108.)p. 362 note 837. Of which the Ancients made their Mirrors, see Callimachus, Hymn5.The fifth Hymn of Callimachus gives the name given by the Greeks to the materialfrom which mirrors were made: “bring not, ye companions of the Bath, for Pallasperfumes nor alabasters (for Athena loves not mixed unguents), neither bring yea mirror. Always her face is fair, and, even when the Phrygian judged the strifeon Ida, the great goddess looked not into orichak.”(A.W. Mair, Callimachus and Lycophron, p. 113) Orichak (images[images/396_9.jpg]) “mountain copper” was a mixture of copper and zinc,frequently given as “Aurichalcum,” or Brass.(Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 1247b)p. 363 note 901. For images [images/397_1.jpg], for so Clement of Alexandria,Stromateis, Liber V, Chap. 8.Stanley intended us to read, images [images/397_2.jpg], “the Sea, a tear ofSaturn,” supplying the wording from Clement of Alexander's Stromata, Liber V,Chapter 8: images [images/397_3.jpg]. “In the same way too, the Pythagoreansfiguratively called the planets the “dogs of Persephone,” and to the sea theyapplied the metaphorical appellation of “the tears of Kronos.”The name of Saturn was omitted by Porphyry, and read only “the Sea, a tear.” Thefull epithet was restored by Kenneth Guthrie, but who preferred translatingimages [images/397_4.jpg] using the Greek “Kronos” rather than the Romanequivalent “Saturn.” (Dindorf, Clementis Alexandrini Opera, Vol. 3, p. 40;Kiessling, Iamblichi Chalcidensis Ex Coele-Suria De Vita Pythagorica, Vol. 2, p.72., and Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, p.131.)p. 364 note 907. Perhaps images [images/397_5.jpg], [“disbelieve”.]For “disbelieve.” Cf. Liddell Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, p. 189b, images[images/397_6.jpg]. In the listing of the Pythagorean Symbols in theProtrepticus of Iamblicus, the 25th Symbol is, images [images/397_7.jpg],“Concerning the gods, disbelieve nothing wonderful, nor concerning DivineDoctrines.” When explained, it is switched to the position of Symbol #4. In thisbook, it is both listed and explained as Symbol #4. In the Protrepticus theexplanation reads:images [images/397_8.jpg]Stanley's correction to images [images/397_9.jpg] appears to be unique, notfollowed by either Piscelli or Edouard Des Places. Thomas Moore Johnsonapproached the text a bit differently and translated, “For it urges us toacquire a science of that kind through which we shall be in no respect deficientin things asserted about the gods.” (Cf. Pistelli, Iamblichi Protrepticus AdFidem Codicis Florentini, pp. 107 & 121, Des Places, Jamblique Protreptique, pp.134 & 146, and Johnson, Iamblicus: The Exhortation to Philosophy, p. 98)p. 365 note 963. images [images/397_10.jpg] perhaps is for images[images/397_11.jpg]. Doric.The Doric word images [images/397_12.jpg] the equivalent of the Attic images[images/397_13.jpg]images [images/397_14.jpg], “proper,” or as Stanley has it,“good.” From Timaei Locri, De Anima Mundi:images [images/398_1.jpg]Thomas Tobin, following the restoration of William Marg to the first line andreads, images [images/398_2.jpg] etc…“Accordingly, the cause of vice comes rather from our parents and from our ownbasic elements than from ourselves, granted that there is no laziness and thatwe do not shrink from our proper duties.”(Cf. Tobin, Timaios of Locri, On the Nature of the World and the Soul, pp.66-67, Marg, Timaeus Locrus. De Natura Mundi et Animae, p. 146, Burges, Works ofPlato, Vol. 6, p. 166, and Stallbaum, Platonis Opera Omnia, Vol. 7, p. 439)"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAhrens, Heinrich.

The profound impact of that Revolution is felt to this dayin the political destinies of millions of people worldwide. The Illuminati haddeclared war against Church and State and worked feverishly to spread theirgospel of Liberty and Reason. Although the Order was officially suppressed onthe eve of the Revolution, its efforts do not appear to have been in vain.The recruiting program of Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt was focused onattracting powerful and influential members—government ministers, educators, thepress, authors, philosophers, booksellers, publishers, even religious leadersopen to agnostic or atheist views. Many such men belonged to the Masonic lodgesof Germany, Austria and France. The European Masonic network offered Weishaupt arespectable vehicle by which he was able to propagate his clandestine doctrines.The great philosophical/political battle of the Enlightenment was fought betweenthe ideologies of individualism as exemplified in the American Revolution, andstatism in the French.Historian Una Birch provides a compelling account of the activities of thesesecret societies and the conditions of political oppression against which theyrebelled. Secret society scholar James Wasserman provides an account of theRevolution itself along with biographical sketches of some 300 individualsreferenced by Birch.ISBN: 978-0-89254-132-4288 Pages, 6” × 9”. • Paperback. $18.95"},{"pageContent":"Initiation in the Aeon of the ChildThe Inward JourneyJ.
