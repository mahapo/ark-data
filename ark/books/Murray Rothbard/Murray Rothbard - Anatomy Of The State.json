Some theorists venerate the State as the apotheosis of society; oth- ers regard it as an amiable, though often inefficient, organization for achieving social ends; but almost all regard it as a necessary means for achieving the goals of mankind, a means to be ranged against the “pri- vate sector” and often winning in this compe- tition of resources.

If “we are the government,” then anything a govern- ment does to an individual is not only just and untyrannical but also “voluntary” on the part of the individual concerned. If the government has incurred a huge public debt which must be paid by taxing one group for the benefit of another, this reality of burden is obscured by saying that “we owe it to ourselves”; if the gov- ernment conscripts a man, or throws him into jail for dissident opinion, then he is “doing it to himself” and, therefore, nothing untoward has occurred. Under this reasoning, any Jews murdered by the Nazi government were not murdered; instead, they must have “commit- ted suicide,” since they were the government (which was democratically chosen), and, there- fore, anything the government did to them was voluntary on their part. One would not think it necessary to belabor this point, and yet the overwhelming bulk of the people hold this fal- lacy to a greater or lesser degree. We must, therefore, emphasize that “we” are not the government; the government is not “us.” The government does not in any accurate sense “represent” the majority of the people. 1 But, even 1 We cannot, in this chapter, develop the many problems and fallacies of “democracy.” Suffice it to say here that an individual’s"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"if it did, even if 70 percent of the people decided to murder the remaining 30 percent, this would still be murder and would not be voluntary sui- cide on the part of the slaughtered minority. 2 No organicist metaphor, no irrelevant bromide that “we are all part of one another,” must be permit- ted to obscure this basic fact. If, then, the State is not “us,” if it is not “the human family” getting together to decide mutual problems, if it is not a lodge meeting or coun- try club, what is it? Briefly, the State is that orga- nization in society which attempts to maintain a monopoly of the use of force and violence in a given territorial area; in particular, it is the only organization in society that obtains its revenue not by voluntary contribution or payment for services rendered but by coercion. While other individuals or institutions obtain their income by production of goods and services and by the peaceful and voluntary sale of these goods true agent or “representative” is always subject to that individu- al’s orders, can be dismissed at any time and cannot act contrary to the interests or wishes of his principal. Clearly, the “represen- tative” in a democracy can never fulfill such agency functions, the only ones consonant with a libertarian society. 2 Social democrats often retort that democracy—majority choice of rulers—logically implies that the majority must leave certain freedoms to the minority, for the minority might one day become the majority. Apart from other flaws, this argu- ment obviously does not hold where the minority cannot become the majority, for example, when the minority is of a different racial or ethnic group from the majority.

The only way by which man can do this is by the use of his mind and energy to transform resources (“production”) and to exchange these products for products created by others. Man has found that, through the process of voluntary, mutual exchange, the productivity and hence, the liv- ing standards of all participants in exchange may increase enormously.

Through this path, men have learned how to avoid the “jungle” methods of fighting over scarce resources so that A can only acquire them at the expense of B and, instead, to multiply those resources enormously in peaceful and harmonious production and exchange. The great German sociologist Franz Oppen- heimer pointed out that there are two mutu- ally exclusive ways of acquiring wealth; one, the above way of production and exchange, he called the “ economic means.” The other way is simpler in that it does not require productivity; it is the way of seizure of another’s goods or services by the use of force and violence. This is the method of one-sided confiscation, of theft of the prop- erty of others. This is the method which Oppen- heimer termed “the political means” to wealth. It should be clear that the peaceful use of reason and energy in production is the “natural” path for man: the means for his survival and prosperity on this earth. It should be equally clear that the coer- cive, exploitative means is contrary to natural law; 14 A NATOMY OF THE S TATE"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"it is parasitic, for instead of adding to production, it subtracts from it.

In the long run, the robber destroys his own subsistence by dwindling or elim- inating the source of his own supply. But not only that; even in the short-run, the predator is acting contrary to his own true nature as a man. We are now in a position to answer more fully the question: what is the State ? The State, in the words of Oppenheimer, is the “organization of the political means”; it is the systematization of the predatory process over a given territory. 4 For crime, at best, is sporadic and uncertain; the parasitism is 4 Franz Oppenheimer, The State (New York: Vanguard Press, 1926) pp. 24 –27: There are two fundamentally opposed means whereby man, requiring sustenance, is impelled to obtain the necessary means for satisfying his desires.

The State has never been created by a “social contract”; it has always been born in conquest and exploitation. The classic paradigm was a conquering tribe paus- ing in its time-honored method of looting and mur- dering a conquered tribe, to realize that the time- span of plunder would be longer and more secure, and the situation more pleasant, if the conquered tribe were allowed to live and produce, with the conquerors settling among them as rulers exacting a steady annual tribute. 6 One method of the birth 5 Albert Jay Nock wrote vividly that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime. . . .

Therefore, the chief task of the rulers is always to secure the active or resigned acceptance of the majority of the citizens. 8, 9 Of course, one method of securing support is through the creation of vested economic interests. Therefore, the King alone cannot rule; he must have a sizable group of followers who enjoy the pre- requisites of rule, for example, the members of the 8 Such acceptance does not, of course, imply that the State rule has become “voluntary”; for even if the majority support be active and eager, this support is not unanimous by every individual. 9 That every government, no matter how “dictatorial” over individuals, must secure such support has been demonstrated by such acute political theorists as Étienne de la Boétie, David Hume, and Ludwig von Mises.

Promoting this ideology among the people is the vital social task of the “ intellectu- als.” For the masses of men do not create their own ideas, or indeed think through these ideas inde- pendently; they follow passively the ideas adopted and disseminated by the body of intellectuals. The intellectuals are, therefore, the “opinion-molders” in society. And since it is precisely a molding of opinion that the State most desperately needs, the basis for age-old alliance between the State and the intellectuals becomes clear.

Basically, the strands of argument may be summed up as fol- lows: (a) the State rulers are great and wise men (they “rule by divine right,” they are the “aristoc- racy” of men, they are the “scientific experts”), much greater and wiser than the good but rather simple subjects, and (b) rule by the extent gov- ernment is inevitable, absolutely necessary, and far better, than the indescribable evils that would ensue upon its downfall. The union of Church and State was one of the oldest and most suc- cessful of these ideological devices. The ruler was either anointed by God or, in the case of the absolute rule of many Oriental despotisms, was himself God; hence, any resistance to his rule would be blasphemy. The States’ priestcraft per- formed the basic intellectual function of obtain- ing popular support and even worship for the rulers. 15 Another successful device was to instill fear of any alternative systems of rule or nonrule.

For the State, to pre- serve its own monopoly of predation, did indeed see to it that private and unsystematic crime was kept to a minimum; the State has always been jealous of its own preserve. Especially has the State been successful in recent centuries in instilling fear of other State rulers. Since the land area of the globe has been parceled out among particular States, one of the basic doctrines of the State was to identify itself with the territory it governed. Since most men tend to love their homeland, the identification of that land and its people with the State was a means of mak- ing natural patriotism work to the State’s advan- tage. If “Ruritania” was being attacked by “Wallda- via,” the first task of the State and its intellectuals was to convince the people of Ruritania that the attack was really upon them and not simply upon the ruling caste. In this way, a war between rulers was converted into a war between peoples , with each people coming to the defense of its rul- ers in the erroneous belief that the rulers were defending them . This device of “nationalism” has only been successful, in Western civilization, in recent centuries; it was not too long ago that the mass of subjects regarded wars as irrelevant bat- tles between various sets of nobles.

The longer that the rule of a State has been able to preserve itself, the more powerful this weapon; for then, the X Dynasty or the Y State has the seeming weight of centuries of tradition behind it. 16 Worship of one’s ancestors, then, becomes a none too subtle means of worship of one’s ancient rulers. The greatest danger to the State is independent intellectual criticism; there is no better way to stifle that criticism than to attack any isolated voice, any raiser of new doubts, as a profane violator of the wisdom of his ancestors. Another potent ideological force is to deprecate the individual and exalt the collectivity of society. For since any given rule implies majority accep- tance, any ideological danger to that rule can only start from one or a few independently- thinking individuals. The new idea, much less the new cri- ti cal idea, must needs begin as a small minority opinion; therefore, the State must nip the view in the bud by ridiculing any view that defies the 16 De Jouvenel, On Power , p. 22: The essential reason for obedience is that it has become a habit of the species. . . .

If the X Dynasty rules us, this is because the Inex- orable Laws of History (or the Divine Will, or the Absolute, or the Material Productive Forces) have so decreed and nothing any puny individu- als may do can change this inevitable decree.

Furthermore, an attack on “ conspiracy theories” means that the subjects will become more gullible in believing the “general welfare” reasons that are always put forth by the State for engaging in any of its des- potic actions.

Let Black illustrate the problem: The supreme risk [to the government] is that of disaffection and a feeling of outrage widely dis- seminated throughout the population, and loss of moral authority by the government as such, however long it may be propped up by force or inertia or the lack of an appealing and imme- diately available alternative.

Calhoun. Calhoun was not content with the “miracle,” but instead proceeded to a profound analysis of the constitutional problem. In his Dis- quisition , Calhoun demonstrated the inherent tendency of the State to break through the limits of such a constitution: A written constitution certainly has many and con- siderable advantages, but it is a great mistake to suppose that the mere insertion of provisions to restrict and limit the power of the government, with- out investing those for whose protection they are inserted with the means of enforcing their obser- vance [my italics] will be sufficient to prevent the major and dominant party from abusing its powers. Being the party in possession of the government, they will, from the same constitution of man which makes government necessary to protect society, be in favor of the powers granted by the constitution and opposed to the restrictions intended to limit them. . . . The minor or weaker party, on the con- trary, would take the opposite direction and regard them [the restrictions] as essential to their pro- tection against the dominant party. . . . But where there are no means by which they could compel the major party to observe the restrictions, the only resort left them would be a strict construc- tion of the constitution. . . . To this the major party would oppose a liberal construction . . . . It would"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 A NATOMY OF THE S TATE be construction against construction—the one to contract and the other to enlarge the powers of the government to the utmost. But of what possi- ble avail could the strict construction of the minor party be, against the liberal construction of the major, when the one would have all the power of the government to carry its construction into effect and the other be deprived of all means of enforc- ing its construction? In a contest so unequal, the result would not be doubtful. The party in favor of the restrictions would be overpowered. . . . The end of the contest would be the subversion of the constitution . . . the restrictions would ultimately be annulled and the government be converted into one of unlimited powers. 29 One of the few political scientists who appreciated Calhoun’s analysis of the Constitu- tion was Professor J. Allen Smith. Smith noted that the Constitution was designed with checks and balances to limit any one governmental power and yet had then developed a Supreme Court with the monopoly of ultimate interpret- ing power. If the Federal Government was cre- ated to check invasions of individual liberty by the separate states, who was to check the Fed- eral power? Smith maintained that implicit in the check-and-balance idea of the Constitution was the concomitant view that no one branch 29 John C.

Applied to state governments, this theory implied the right of “nullification” of a Federal law or ruling within a state’s jurisdiction. In theory, the ensuing constitutional system would assure that the Federal Government check 30 J.

And yet, while limitations would undoubtedly be more effective than at present, there are many difficulties and problems in the Calhoun solution. If, indeed, a subordinate inter- est should rightfully have a veto over matters con- cerning it, then why stop with the states? Why not place veto power in counties, cities, wards? Fur- thermore, interests are not only sectional, they are also occupational, social, etc. What of bakers or taxi drivers or any other occupation? Should they not be permitted a veto power over their own lives? This brings us to the important point that the nullification theory confines its checks to agencies of government itself. Let us not for- get that federal and state governments, and their respective branches, are still states, are still guided by their own state interests rather than by the interests of the private citizens. What is to prevent the Calhoun system from working in reverse, with states tyrannizing over their citizens and only vetoing the federal government when it tries to intervene to stop that state tyranny? Or for states to acquiesce in federal tyranny? What is to prevent federal and state governments from forming mutually profitable alliances for the joint exploitation of the citizenry?

In short, Calhoun does not push his path- breaking theory on concurrence far enough: he does not push it down to the individual him- self. If the individual, after all, is the one whose rights are to be protected, then a consistent theory of concurrence would imply veto power by every individual; that is, some form of “una- nimity principle.” When Calhoun wrote that it should be “impossible to put or to keep it [the government] in action without the concurrent consent of all,” he was, perhaps unwittingly, implying just such a conclusion. 31 But such speculation begins to take us away from our subject, for down this path lie political systems which could hardly be called “States” at all. 32 For one thing, just as the right of nullification for a state logically implies its right of secession , so 31 Calhoun, A Disquisition on Government , pp. 20–21. 32 In recent years, the unanimity principle has experienced a highly diluted revival, particularly in the writings of Professor James Buchanan. Injecting unanimity into the present situa- tion, however, and applying it only to changes in the status quo and not to existing laws, can only result in another transforma- tion of a limiting concept into a rubber stamp for the State. If the unanimity principle is to be applied only to changes in laws and edicts, the nature of the initial “point of origin” then makes all the difference. Cf.

Since the State necessarily lives by the compulsory confiscation of private capital, and since its expansion necessarily involves ever-greater incursions on private individuals and private enterprise, we must assert that the State is pro- foundly and inherently anti capitalist. In a sense, our position is the reverse of the Marxist dictum that the State is the “executive committee” of the ruling class in the present day, supposedly the capitalists. Instead, the State — the organiza- tion of the political means—constitutes, and is the source of, the “ruling class” (rather, ruling caste ), and is in permanent opposition to genu- inely private capital.

So they adopted the practice of hiring mercenaries to do their fight- ing for them, and, being thrifty, businesslike folk, they dismissed their mercenaries imme- diately after their services could be dispensed with.

Perhaps new paths of inquiry must be explored, if the successful, final solution of the State question is ever to be attained. 44 43 This parasitic process of “catching up” has been almost openly proclaimed by Karl Marx, who conceded that social- ism must be established through seizure of capital previously accumulated under capitalism. 44 Certainly, one indispensable ingredient of such a solution must be the sundering of the alliance of intellectual and State, through the creation of centers of intellectual inquiry and education, which will be independent of State power. Chris- topher Dawson notes that the great intellectual movements of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment were achieved by working outside of, and sometimes against, the entrenched universities . These academia of the new ideas were established by independent patrons.
