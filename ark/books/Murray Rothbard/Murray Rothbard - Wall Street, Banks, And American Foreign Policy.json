Everyone knows that the military-industrial complex is fat and corrupt, that presidents bestow money and privilege on their donors and favored businesses, that a revolving door connects Wall Street and the White House, that economic motivations lurk behind America’s wars. But to make too fine a point of this is typically dismissed as unserious conspiracy theorizing, unworthy of mainstream consideration. We have seen this paradox at work in the aermath of the 2008 financial collapse. e le-liberals blame Wall Street and Big Finance for betraying the masses out of predatory greed and for being rewarded for their irresponsibility by Washington’s bailouts. At the same time, the le appears reluctant to oppose these bailouts outright, seeing the spending as a necessary evil to return the global economy to stability, however inequitably. What’s more, le-liberals fail to call out President Obama and Democratic leaders for their undeniable hand in all this. ey blame Goldman-Sachs but see their president, who got more cam- paign money from the firm than from almost any other source, as a helpless victim of circumstance, rather than an energetic con- spirator in corporate malfeasance on top of being the enthusiastic vii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY heir and expansionist of George W. Bush’s aggressive foreign policy. e Tea Party right is also hesitant to examine the corpo- rate state too closely. ese conservatives detect an elitism in Obama’s governance but are loath to earnestly challenge the economic status quo, for it would lead to uncomfortable questions about the warfare state, defense contractors, U.S. wars, the whole history of the Republican Party, and all the typical rightwing assumptions about the inherent fairness of America’s supposedly “free enterprise” system. By refusing to admit that economic fundamentals were unsound through the entirety of the Bush years—by failing to acknowledge the imperial reality of U.S. wars and their debilitating effect on the average household budget— the right is forgoing its chance to delve beyond the surface in its criticism of Obama’s reign. Many on the right call Obama a “socialist” as many on the le accused Bush of being a “fascist,” neither group seeing the stark similarities in almost all of their policies. Meanwhile, the more mainstream forces on both le and right refuse to countenance such “extremist” rhetoric and insist that both political parties, for all their differences, have the best of America’s interests at heart. In the le’s unflinching loyalty to social democracy and economic intervention and the right’s invincible love for the military and support for corporate America we see why we are allowed to de- cry corruption and special interests, but not dig too much deeper than that, lest we be relegated to the periphery of respectable discussion. Never afraid to slaughter sacred cows, Murray N. Rothbard goes far beyond the mainstream lamentations in his trenchant Wall Street, Banks, and American Foreign Policy . He analyzes over a century of U.S. militarism and corporate cronyism, naming names, sparing no one, and demonstrating the continuity of imperialism regardless of the party in control, alongside the many overlapping and competing business interests behind the curtains.

It should be clear that the name of the political party in power is far less important than the particular regime’s financial and banking connections.” is fantastic wrien work is the definitive answer to many naysayers—those who boast great differences between Republi- cans and Democrats; those who insist the main engine behind U.S. wars is concern for national defense or human rights abroad; those who dismiss “conspiracy theorizing” as oversimplified ac- cusations of behind-the-scenes power-broking, devoid of nuance and sophistication; and those who myopically think all major decisions are made by the exact same clique of major players, rather than through a complicated confluence of sundry interests and forces. Peddlers of oversimplified conspiracy theories will be uncom- fortable with the level of detail in this book, as will the court intellectuals who regard any and all references to the duplicity of groups like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission as the talk of paranoids completely divorced from reality. Furthermore, people who think that the elimination of corporate influence from the public sphere will finally end the wars and gra will be encouraged to rethink their assumptions about the state: it is not, aer all, an organization for the public good that has been hijacked by the rich and powerful, nor an engine of corporate control that can be reformed toward liberal ends. e state itself is and always will be the problem, and so long as it has a military arm, it will be influenced by some private interests or others toward opportunistic warring, and at"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY a minimum manipulated by politicians, even the most supposedly humanitarian and egalitarian of whom have a murderous and diabolical record in deploying its forces and dropping its bombs. Even large business interests can come and go, but the political apparatus itself, the most inherently corrupting of all institutions given its unavoidably coercive and monopolistic nature, will con- tinue to inflict misery and loot the disadvantaged on behalf of the powerful. On the other hand, unlike moderate libertarians who regard businessmen conspiring with government to be at worst mere accessories to political crime made inevitable by the mixed econ- omy, Rothbard does not temper his indictment of these junior members of the public-private partnerships of imperialist plun- der. Free will exists under the Rothbardian conception of both political and economic theory, and if there’s blame to go around, the bankers, lobbying CEOs, and saber-raling policy wonks de- serve a considerable share along with the generals and presidents. In many writings, Rothbard scrutinized the unseemly rela- tions between policymakers and business interests. He champi- oned a revival of libertarian class analysis, reclaiming the exercise from the Marxists and leists who had transformed it from the study of the tax-consuming political class against the taxpaying subjects into a narrative of the dialectical struggle between pro- ducers and workers. Although Marx and his followers correctly aacked the modern state for securing privileges for the most influential business interests, the leist conception has turned the classical liberal concept of class analysis on its head in its advocacy of proletarian capture of the state apparatus and its casting of producers and entrepreneurs as the inevitable enemies of the common man. Nevertheless, leist scholars, particularly of the New Le variety, have tended to “follow the money” in their examination of government gra, corruption and war, a task greatly appreciated by Rothbard and his fellow travelers.

One general point bears this out. In failing to grasp basic economics, the le falls for the military Keynesianism that oen sees war as a blessing for the economy, if not in all other ways. In January 2008, le-liberal economics guru Paul Krugman (who had years earlier called for a Fed-induced housing bubble), complained on his New York Times blog: One thing I get asked fairly oen is whether the Iraq war is responsible for our economic difficulties. e answer (with slight qualifications) is no.... e fact is that war is, in general, expansionary for the economy, at least in the short run. World War II, remember, ended the Great Depression. Even the radicals sometimes mistake neo-mercantilist wars as being in the interest of average American taxpayers—Noam Chomsky has oen intoned that the American economy at large relies on these wars—leading to an incomplete critique and a flawed class analysis. is has guided the le in misconstruing George W. Bush’s wars for oil as crude aempts to conquer oil fields on behalf of U.S. consumers, rather than as efforts to benefit some firms at the expense of others. (Also largely neglected, com- pared to the oil angle, were the possible monetary motivations involved, as Iraq had begun pricing its oil in Euros in late 2000, in defiance of American dollar supremacists.) Bad economic theory also meant that when the George H. W. Bush’s Secretary of State, James Baker, said the first Gulf War was about “jobs, jobs, jobs,” the population was helpless but to take it at face value. Flawed economic comprehension coincides with a poor read- ing of history. e le is still largely proud of its heritage in the Progressive Era, when supposedly altruistic politicians stood up for the common man against Big Business. Rothbard unravels this fraud completely. e revered Teddy Roosevelt “had been a Mor- gan man from the beginning,” with family, business and political"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY ties to the banking giant. Roosevelt’s “first act aer the election of 1900 was to throw a lavish dinner in honor of J.P. Morgan,” and many of his policies, from the 1903 Panama coup to the trust busting of Standard Oil, were huge blessings for Morgan interests. e 1912 Progressive Bull Moose Party, far from being an aempt to challenge the pro-business Ta administration for reasons of egalitarian idealism, was also a Morgan plot. e winner of the 1912 election, Woodrow Wilson, far from aempting to rein in the banks via the Federal Reserve Act, was a great champion of the wealthiest of banking elites, especially the Morgans. e Fed itself “enabled the banking system to inflate money and credit, finance loans to the Allies, and float massive deficits once the U.S. entered the war.” More recently, the le-liberal criticisms of Bush suggested that he had broken with an honorable American past in the way he waged war—and in particular condemned his economic moti- vations as though they were something new or uniquely Republi- can. Very few critics saw Bush as following a tradition that goes back at least to Franklin Roosevelt’s entry into World War II— a war, Rothbard reminds us, the banking elites were pressing for throughout the late 1930s. at war is still sanctified as a testament to human altruism and a struggle of good against evil. But World War II might also “be considered, from one point of view, as a coalition war: the Morgans got their war in Europe, the Rockefellers theirs in Asia.” Henry Stimson, the War Secretary, had been a Wall Street lawyer with as many corporate ties as any modern warmonger, and his assistant John J. McCloy, whom Rothbard exposes for the particularly horrific policy decision of Japanese Internment, went on to a lucrative career in the Rocke- feller orbit with a side gig as chairman of the CFR for 17 years. If the military-industrial complex did not exist beforehand, it was a reality by the end of World War II. e ménage à trois among the arms merchants, the U.S. war machine, and New York’s financial powerhouses became fully consummated even before George W. Bush was born."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 2011 EDITION xiii Beloved liberal presidents Truman, Kennedy, Johnson and Carter all saturated their defense leadership posts with banking elites. In particular, Rothbard shows that beginning with the Kennedy administration an unseling influence on foreign pol- icy was enjoyed by representatives from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs—firms whose nefarious impact is not lost on Americans reading the financial news today. e cozy connection between Lehman Brothers and the Pentagon was an especially “fascinating aspect of the Johnson administration.” Lehman and other major finance houses also dominated Carter’s top brass. Somehow, the le generally regards these presidents as, at worst, pushovers for corporate influence, rather than criminals guilty of premeditated looting and warring on behalf of their cronies. e financial collapse and bailouts are only the latest exam- ple of the near incoherence of the liberal critique. We are to believe that the CEOs of major financial institutions are devoid of compassion, the regulators are neglected heroes mysteriously deprived of power since the Reagan years (although exactly how this was done is never compellingly explained), and the president is at worst a well-intentioned dupe. is formulation is partisan, but even the anti-corporate criticism of Bush betrays a strange faith in government itself, as it accused Bush of failing to “do enough” and insisting on retrenching his own executive branch’s power over the economy. All this even aer Sarbanes-Oxley and Bush’s other major expansions of the regulatory state, far beyond what happened under Bill Clinton. Today’s wars, too, seem to confound the le-liberal who sees corporate interests and conservative agitation behind all policy failures. e war in Iraq, we were told, was a break with Amer- ican traditions of diplomatic prudence. It is true that the neo- conservatives represented an ideological school unusually bent on democratization by force—hyper-Wilsonians, almost—who indeed signified a shi from the “realist” school that had been economically oriented around the Rockefellers that bestrode pol- icy at least since World War II. For what it’s worth, much of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY economic establishment was conspicuously more wary of the Iraq war than most U.S. military adventures. is seems something of an anomaly but there was a parallel situation in 1968, when, as Rothbard tells it, even many of the “elite figures” of the Johnson administration “had swung around to a firm opposition to the war,” joined by much of the Establishment and Wall Street. We can only dream of how Rothbard would have reacted to the temporary triumph of the neocons over the realists in Iraq. But needless to say, the general trajectory of U.S. foreign policy—presidential wars of aggression, neo-mercantilism, Fed- financed bombings, trade sanctions, exploiting the UN and NATO when expedient—has been fairly consistent from the Progressive Era to Obama, Bush’s aberration notwithstanding. And now the U.S. is solidly back in the “realist” tradition with Obama, who is using international coalitions to obscure the aggression against Libya, and who is continuing the imperial project in Afghanistan that originated with the meddling of Carter’s National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, a practical paragon of the realist school. More than a decade aer Rothbard wrote this book, identifying Brzezinski as a Trilateral executive director and “re- cently selected director of the CFR,” this establishment poster boy claimed credit for intentionally baiting the Soviets into invading Afghanistan—a fateful intervention that has changed U.S. policy in the Muslim world irreversibly. When the le aacked the neocons over Iraq—echoing, whether they knew it or not, critiques of neoconservatism that can be traced to Rothbard and his Old-Right tradition—they did not really understand what they were aacking. ey neglected almost completely the lewing and particularly Trotskyite ori- gins of neoconservatism, and tended to downplay the centrality of Israel. ey somehow conflated a condemnation of Bush’s “privatization” of war, his reliance on military contractors, and his alleged desire to seize Arab oil, with their critique of neocon- servatism, even though economics and corporate cronyism were never major interests of this foreign-policy school."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 2011 EDITION xv is helps to explain the current confusion, for Obama has greatly increased the presence of military contractors, expanded the war in Afghanistan, bombed Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya, and seems generally on board with almost all of the Bush program, including the withdrawal schedule in Iraq. Oil politics and the planned construction of pipelines through Afghanistan are still in the background. e economic and imperial interests behind America’s response to 9/11 go far beyond the neocons and their diversion in Iraq. Of course, the war leaders of the supposedly anomalous Bush years had been establishment luminaries for decades. National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Condolezza Rice was on the first Bush’s National Security Council and later served on the board of Chevron. Vice President Dick Cheney (along with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld) had begun his rise under Nixon. Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Rela- tions in the late 1980s and, infamously, served in the late 1990s as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Haliburton—the oil services firm that was awarded significant contracts under Clinton during his interventions in the Balkans, became a major beneficiary of Bush’s war in Iraq (as well as constructing holding cells for the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay), and still maintains such ties to the empire. Cheney, it might be noted, was also a member of the Trilateral Commission—that elite club founded by David Rockefeller that came to dominate the halls of power beginning in the Carter administration. Writing in 1984, Rothbard concludes that re- gardless of the next election we could expect this organization to be well represented. In addition to Cheney, Trilateral mem- bers who have risen or remained high in American government since 1984 include Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, George H. W. Bush, his national security adviser Brent Scowcro, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Clinton cabinet members Lloyd Bentsen (Treasury), Warren Christopher (State Department) and William Cohen (Defense).

Bush’s Treasury Secretary, Paul O’Neill, Obama’s economic adviser, Paul Volker, and his foreign policy adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice. e corporate state’s continuities transcend partisanship. Ben Bernanke, Bush’s economic adviser and later choice for Fed Chair- man, was reappointed to this high seat by Obama. Another holdover from the Bush years is Bush’s second Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, whose checkered past includes urging Reagan to sell weapons to Iran in 1985, heading the CIA under George H. W. Bush, and serving on boards for such giants as Fidelity Investments, NACCO Industries and Brinker International. When Obama chose as Treasury Secretary the young Timo- thy Geithner the man was already a precocious fixture of the establishment. He worked for Kissinger Associates in DC and then joined the U.S. Treasury Department’s International Affairs division in 1988. He went on to work for the U.S. embassy in Tokyo, served as an assistant in monetary and financial policy for years, always with an international focus, and became Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 1998. In 2002, he was a Senior Fellow in the International Economics de- partment at the Council on Foreign Relations, while also serving as director of the Policy Development and Review Department at the International Monetary Fund. In late 2003, he became the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and then the Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Commiee. In March 2008 he was intimately involved in the bailout and sale of Bear Stearns. In the wake of the financial meltdown, Obama’s choice of Geithner to head Treasury was surreally touted far and wide as a pragmatic, responsible move. But even the minor appointments demonstrate the irony of Obama’s reputation as a champion of the common man against Big Business—the president’s pick of General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt to oversee the effort to curb unemployment rhymes nicely with FDR’s pick of GE CEO Gerard Swope to head the National Recovery Administration."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 2011 EDITION xvii Of course, Obama himself is deeply in the pocket of the fi- nance industry. Goldman Sachs accounted for over $994,000 of Obama’s war chest. Lehman Brothers was the origin of $395,600, a record amount for the company second only to what Hillary Clinton received. Out of 20 of his biggest sources of campaign money, eleven were investment banks or closely associated law firms. Justin Raimondo noted in 2008 that Obama’s fat cat donors included top executives from Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Cit- igroup, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, J. P. Mor- gan, Chase, Morgan Stanley and Countrywide. Recent events demonstrate the pervasive denial of the banking and foreign policy nexus. In February 2010, Congressman Ron Paul caused a stir in the House of Representatives when, con- fronting Bernanke, he noted that “it has been reported in the past that during the 1980s the Fed actually facilitated a $5.5 billion dollar loan to Saddam Hussein, and then he bought weapons from our military industrial complex.” Bernanke found the allegation too absurd to warrant a serious response. Paul later cited Uni- versity of Texas professor Robert D. Auerbach, author of the 2008 book Deception and Abuse at the Fed and professor at University of Texas, to defend his statement. Whether or not Bernanke was sin- cere in his disbelief of this nefarious connection between the Fed and U.S. diplomacy, many onlookers were similarly incredulous. In March 2011, as the Obama administration was bombing Libya, Senator Bernie Sanders wrote an open leer to Bernanke, asking why the Fed provided 45 emergency loans at nearly zero interest, totaling over $26 billion, to the central bank of Libya from December 2007 to March 2010. He further asked why the bank and its two New York branches were exempted from U.S. sanctions on Libyan businesses. Meanwhile, the media celebrated the supposed success of TARP, the $700 billion bailout package passed at the tail end of the George W. Bush presidency. At that time we had been told it was necessary or else the financial collapse would swallow the economy whole. Most Americans were skeptical, suspecting"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY they were being robbed by the very forces responsible for the crisis in the first place. e AP reported on March 30, 2011, amidst the official vindication of TARP: “Some banks will use money from a government program aimed at increasing small business loans to repay their federal bailouts, according to the Treasury Department official who oversees the bailout program.” e headline was more concise: “Banks will use Fed funds to repay Fed bailout.” Since the publication of Wall Street, Banks, and American For- eign Policy a number of other works have emerged in the Rothbar- dian tradition of tracing the history of the central banking elite and its warfare state conspirators. G. Edward Griffin’s extensive book e Creature from Jekyll Island (1994), addressing economic theory and history predating the material covered here by Roth- bard, is particularly worth mentioning. Robert Higgs’s 2007 book Depression War and Cold War examines the defense industry’s role in World War II and the Cold War. For the definitive treatment on World War I corporatism, with an emphasis on arms merchants as well as the banks, see T. Hunt Tooley’s “ Merants of Death Revisited: Armaments, Bankers, and the First World War,” from the Winter 2004 edition of the Journal of Libertarian Studies . It includes a bibliography of many great references. As for the issues of the 21st century, there are not many sur- vey works on the connections between the war machine and the banking establishment. John Perkins’s Confessions of an Economic Hitman (2004) tells his story as an agent of international finance with ties to the U.S. security state, convincing ird World nations to accept crushing loans.

Finally, one article in the Huffington Post deserves mention for daring to show the relationship between the central bank and America’s court intellectuals: Ryan Grim’s “Priceless: How e Federal Reserve Bought e Economics Profession,” which appeared in October 2009. What’s missing from most accounts of 21st century war and banking, however, is a sound, Austro-libertarian class analysis combined with a grasp of the business cycle, the meaning of hu- man action in the military-industrial complex, and the inherently predatory nature of the state. Joe Salerno’s 2006 work, “Praxe- ology and the Logic of Warmaking,” helps to set the theoretical grounding that war, like all purposeful human activities, has an economic logic to it and can be understood in terms of what its perpetrators seek to gain. For an Austrian treatment of the hous- ing crisis and the corruption in defense spending, Tom Woods’s 2011 book Rollba: Repealing Big Government Before the Coming Fiscal Collapse provides some helpful chapters. Ron Paul’s End the Fed has a section on inflation and war. Plenty of articles on different facets of the imperial corporate state can be found on Mises.org , LewRockwell.com , Antiwar.com and elsewhere.

It represents a small and highly specialized sample of Rothbard’s vast historical knowledge coming together with a lifetime devoted to methodological indi- vidualism in the social sciences. It appeared first in 1984, in the thick of the Reagan years, in a small financial publication called World Market Perspective .

Here, the author relates the history of how the Federal Reserve System came to be foisted on the unsuspect- ing American people by a high-powered alliance of banking in- terests. Rothbard’s economic analysis is clear, concise, and wide- ranging, covering the nature of money, the genesis of government paper money, the inherent instability (and essential fraudulence) of fractional reserve banking, and the true causes of the business cycle. As Rothbard explains in his economic writings, the key is in understanding that money is a commodity, like any other, and thus subject to the laws of the market. A government-granted monopoly in this, the very lifeblood of the economic system, is a recipe for inflation, a debased currency—and the creation of a permanent plutocracy whose power is virtually unlimited. In the present essay, as in e Case Against the Fed , it is in the section on the history of the movement to establish the Federal Reserve System that the Rothbardian power elite analysis comes into full and fascinating play. What is striking about this piece is the plethora of details. Rothbard’s argument is so jam-packed with facts detailing the social, economic, and familial connections of the burgeoning Money Power, that we need to step back and look at it in the light of Rothbardian theory, specifically Roth- bard’s theory of class analysis. Rothbard eagerly reclaimed the concept of class analysis from the Marxists, who expropriated it from the French theorists of laissez-faire . Marx authored a plagiarized, distorted, and vulgar- ized version of the theory based on the Ricardian labor theory of value. Given this premise, he came up with a class analysis piing workers against owners. One of Rothbard’s many great contributions to the cause of liberty was to restore the original theory, which pied the people"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 1995 EDITION xxiii against the State. In the Rothbardian theory of class struggle, the government, including its clients and enforcers, exploits and enslaves the productive classes through taxation, regulation, and perpetual war. Government is an incubus, a parasite, incapable of producing anything in its own right, and instead feeds off the vital energies and productive ability of the producers. is is the first step of a fully-developed libertarian class anal- ysis. Unfortunately, this is where the thought processes of all too many alleged libertarians come to a grinding halt. It is enough, for them, to know the State is the Enemy, as if it were an irre- ducible primary. As William Pi put it in 1770, “ere is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.” Blind to the real forces at work on account of their methodological error, Le-libertarians are content to live in a world of science fiction and utopian schemes, in which they are no threat to the powers that be, and are thus tolerated and at times even encouraged. e Le-libertarian failure to take the analytical process one step further is, in many cases, a failure of nerve. For it is clear, given libertarian theory and the economic insights of the Aus- trian School, where the next step leads. No empirical evidence is necessary, at this point (although that will come later, and in spades); the truth can be deduced from pure theory, specifically the Austrian theory of the nature of money and banking, and the Misesian analysis of the origin of the business cycle. is deduction was brilliantly and colorfully made in the first issue of e Journal of Libertarian Studies (Winter 1977), by two students of Rothbard, Walter E. Grinder and John Hagel III, in “Toward a eory of State Capitalism: Ultimate Decision-Making and Class Structure.” While a pure free market would necessarily prevent the de- velopment of a banking monopoly, “the market system does con- centrate entrepreneurial activity and decision-making within the capital market because of the considerable benefits which are ren- dered by a certain degree of specialization.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xxiv WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY is “specialized capital market, by the very nature of its inte- grative role within the market system, will emerge as a strategic locus of ultimate decision-making.” Given that some individu- als will choose the political means over the economic, some of these great fortunes will utilize their tremendous resources to cartelize the market and insulate themselves against risk. e temptation for bankers in particular to wield the power of the State to their benefit is very great because it permits banks to inflate their asset base systematically. e creation of assets made possible by these measures to a great extent frees the banking in- stitutions from the constraints imposed by the passive form of ul- timate decision-making exercised by their depositors. It thereby considerably strengthens the ultimate decision-making authority held by banks vis-à-vis their depositors. e inflationary trends resulting from the creation of assets tend to increase the ratio of external financing to internal financing in large corporations and, as a consequence, the ultimate decision-making power of banking institutions increases over the activities of industrial cor- porations. e Austrian insight focuses on the key role played by the central banks in generating the distortion of market signals that leads to periodic booms and busts, the dreaded business cycle which is always blamed on the inherent contradictions of unfet- tered capitalism. But in fact this capitalism is anything but unfeered. (Try starting your own private bank!) e last thing American bankers want is an unfeered banking system. Rothbard not only traces the original market distortion that gives rise to the business cy- cle, but also identifies the source (and chief beneficiaries) of this distortion. It was Mises who pointed out that government inter- vention in the economy invariably leads to yet more intervention in order to “fix” the havoc wreaked—and there is a certain logic in the fact that it was the original culprits who decided to “fix” the distortions and disruptions caused by their policies with further assaults on the market mechanism. As Grinder and Hagel put it:"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 1995 EDITION xxv In the U.S., this intervention initially involved sporadic measures, both at the federal and state level, which gen- erated inflationary distortion in the monetary supply and cyclical disruptions of economic activity. e disruptions which accompanied the business cycle were a major factor in the transformation of the dominant ideology in the U.S. from a general adherence to laissez-faire doctrines to an ideology of political capitalism which viewed the state as a necessary instrument for the rationalization and stabi- lization of an inherently unstable economic order.

For virtually all of the al- leged social “reforms” of the past fiy years were pushed not only by “idealistic” Leists, but by the very corporate combines caricatured as the top-haed, pot-bellied “economic royalists” of Wall Street. e neoconservative Right depicts the bale against Big Gov- ernment as a two-sided Manichean struggle between the forces of light (that is, of capitalism) and the remnants of largely dis- credited Leist elites. But Rothbard’s historical analysis reveals a much richer, more complex paern: instead of being two-sided, the struggle for liberty pits at least three sides against each other. For the capitalists, as John T. Flynn, Albert Jay Nock, and Frank Chodorov all pointed out, were never for capitalism. As Nock put it: It is one of the few amusing things in our rather stodgy world that those who today are behaving most tremen- dously about collectivism and the Red menace are the very ones who have cajoled, bribed, flaered and bedeviled the State into taking each and every one of the successive steps that lead straight to collectivism.

As the revisionist economic historians, such as Gabriel Kolko, have shown, those who regulated the great industries in the name of progressive “reform” were recruited from the very cartels and trusts they were created to tame. And of course the monopolists didn’t mind being tamed, so long as their competitors were tamed (if not eliminated). Ev- ery giant leap forward of economic planning and centralization— central banking, the welfare state, “civil rights,” and affirmative action—was supported if not initiated by the biggest and most politically powerful business interests in the country. e House of Morgan, the Rockefellers, and the Kuhn-Loebs must take their place alongside the First, Second, and ird Internationals as the historic enemies of liberty. Giant multinational corporations, and their economic satel- lites, in alliance with governments and the big banks, are in the process of extending their influence on a global scale: they dream of a world central bank, global planning, and an international wel- fare state, with American troops policing the world to guarantee their profit margins. Aer the long bale to create a central bank in the U.S., the high priests of high finance finally seized and consolidated control of do- mestic economic policy. It only remained for them to extend their dominance internationally, and for this purpose they created the Council on Foreign Relations, and, later, the Trilateral Commission. ese two groups have been seized upon by the new pop- ulist Right as the virtual embodiments of the Power Elite, and rightly so. It is only by reading Rothbard, however, that this insight is placed in its proper historical perspective. For the fact of the maer is that, as Rothbard shows, the CFR/Trilateralist network is merely the latest incarnation of a trend deeply rooted in modern American history. Long before the founding of the CFR or the Trilateral Commission, there was a power elite in this"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE 1995 EDITION xxvii country; that elite will likely endure long aer those organiza- tions are gone or transmuted into something else. Rothbard’s unmasking of the historical and economic roots of this trend is vital in understanding that this is not a “conspiracy” centered in the CFR and the Trilateralist groups, as such, but an ideological trend traditionally centered in the Northeast, among the upper classes, and deeply rooted in American history. I put the word “conspiracy” in quotes because it has become the favorite swearword of the Respectable Right and the “extrem- ist”-baiting Le. If it is conspiracy-mongering to believe that human beings engage in purposeful activity to achieve their economic, political, and personal goals, then rational men and women must necessarily plead guilty. e alternative is to as- sert that human action is purposeless, random, and inexplicable. History, in this view, is a series of discontinuous accidents. Yet it would be inaccurate to call the Rothbardian world view a “conspiracy theory.” To say that the House of Morgan was engaged in a “conspiracy” to drag the U.S. into World War I, when indeed it openly used every stratagem, every lever both economic and political, to push us into “the war to end all wars,” seems woefully inadequate. is was not some secret cabal meeting in a soundproof corporate boardroom, but a “conspiracy” of ideas openly and vociferously expressed. (On this point, please note and underscore Rothbard’s analysis of the founding of e New Republic as the literary flagship of “the growing alliance for war and statism” between the Morgan interests and liberal intellectu- als—and isn’t it funny how some things never change?) A conspiracy theory aributes virtually all social problems to a single monolithic agency. Radical feminism, which aributes all the evil in the world to the existence of men, is a classic conspir- acy theory; the paranoid views of the ex-Communists in the con- servative movement, who were obsessed with destroying their ex-comrades, was another. But the complexity and subtlety of the Rothbardian analysis, backed up by the sheer mass of rich historical detail, sets Rothbard"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"xxviii WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY on an altogether different and higher plane. Here there is no single agency, no omnipotent central commiee that issues di- rectives, but a multiplicity of interest groups and factions whose goals are generally congruent. In this milieu, there are familial, social, and economic connec- tions, as well as ideological complicity, and none is beer than Rothbard at ferreting out and unraveling these biographical de- tails. Taken together, the author’s small and studied brushstrokes paint a portrait of a ruling class whose ruthlessness is surpassed only by its brazen disloyalty to the nation. It is a portrait that remains unchanged, in its essentials, to this day. Wall Street, Banks, and American Foreign Policy was wrien and published in 1984, during the Reagan years. Reagan started out by denouncing the power elite and specif- ically the CFR and the Trilateralists, but wound up with that epit- ome of the Establishment, Skull-&-Bonesman George Bush as his vice president and successor. Bush is a longtime CFR director, and Trilateralist; most of his major cabinet officers, including his chairman of the joint chiefs, Colin Powell, were CFR members. e Clinton adminis- tration is similarly afflicted, from the President (CFR/Trilateral) on down through Donna Shalala (CFR/Trilateral) and George Stephanopoulos (CFR), with the CFR honeycombed (as usual) throughout the State Department. In addition to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, other CFR members in the Clinton cab- inet include Laura Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin; Interior Secretary Bruce Babbi, HUD honcho Henry Cisneros; and Alice Rivlin, OMB director. e other side of the aisle is equally co-opted at the leader- ship level, as vividly dramatized by Gingrich’s retreat before the power and majesty of Henry Kissinger.

Hence they are always reaching for government aid and bailout. Investment bankers do much of their business underwriting government bonds, in the United States and abroad. erefore, they have a vested interest in promoting deficits and in forcing taxpayers to redeem government debt. Both sets of bankers, then, tend to be tied in with government policy, and try to influence and control government actions in domestic and foreign affairs. 1"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY In the early years of the nineteenth century, the organized capital market in the United States was largely confined to gov- ernment bonds (then called “stocks”), along with canal companies and banks themselves. Whatever investment banking existed was therefore concentrated in government debt. From the Civil War until the 1890s, there were virtually no manufacturing corpora- tions; manufacturing and other businesses were partnerships and had not yet reached the size where they needed to adopt the corporate form. e only exception was railroads, the biggest industry in the U.S. e first investment banks, therefore, were concentrated in railroad securities and government bonds. e first major investment banking house in the United States was a creature of government privilege. Jay Cooke, an Ohio-born business promoter living in Philadelphia, and his brother Henry, editor of the leading Republican newspaper in Ohio, were close friends of Ohio U.S. Senator Salmon P. Chase. When the new Lincoln administration took over in 1861, the Cookes lobbied hard to secure Chase the appointment of Secretary of the Treasury. at lobbying, plus the then-enormous sum of $100,000 that Jay Cooke poured into Chase’s political coffers, induced Chase to return the favor by granting Cooke, newly set up as an investment banker, an enormously lucrative monopoly in underwriting the entire federal debt. Cooke and Chase then managed to use the virtual Republican monopoly in Congress during the war to transform the American commercial banking system from a relatively free market to a National Banking System centralized by the federal government under Wall Street control. A crucial aspect of that system was that national banks could only expand credit in proportion to the federal bonds they owned—bonds which they were forced to buy from Jay Cooke. Jay Cooke & Co. proved enormously influential in the post- war Republican administrations, which continued their monopoly in underwriting government bonds. e House of Cooke met its well-deserved fate by going bankrupt in the Panic of 1874, a failure helped along by its great rival, the then Philadelphia-based Drexel, Morgan & Co."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"J.

Grover Cleveland himself spent virtually all his life in the Morgan ambit. He grew up in Buffalo as a railroad lawyer, one of his major clients being the Morgan-dominated New York Central Railroad. In between administrations, he became a partner of the powerful New York City law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracey, and MacVeagh. is firm, by the late 1880s, had become the chief legal firm of the House of Morgan, largely because senior partner Charles B. Tracey was J. P. Morgan’s brother-in-law. Aer Tracey died in 1887, Francis Lynde Stetson, an old and close friend of Cleveland’s, became the firm’s dominant partner, as well as the personal aorney for J. P. Morgan. (is is now the Wall St. firm of Davis, Polk, and Wardwell.) 3"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"4 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Grover Cleveland’s cabinets were honeycombed with Morgan men, with an occasional bow to other bankers. Considering those officials most concerned with foreign policy, his first Secretary of State, omas F. Bayard, was a close ally and disciple of Au- gust Belmont; indeed, Belmont’s son, Perry, had lived with and worked for Bayard in Congress as his top aide. e dominant Secretary of State in the second Cleveland administration was the powerful Richard Olney, a leading lawyer for Boston finan- cial interests, who have always been tied in with the Morgans, and in particular was on the Board of the Morgan-run Boston and Maine Railroad, and would later help Morgan organize the General Electric Company. e War and Navy departments under Cleveland were equally banker-dominated. Boston Brahmin Secretary of War William C. Endico had married into the wealthy Peabody family. Endico’s wife’s uncle, George Peabody, had established a banking firm which included J. P. Morgan’s father as a senior partner; and a Peabody had been best man at J.P.’s wedding. Secretary of the Navy was leading New York City financier William C. Whitney, a close friend and top political advisor of Cleveland’s. Whitney was closely allied with the Morgans in running the New York Central Railroad. Secretary of War in the second Cleveland administration was an old friend and aide of Cleveland’s, Daniel S. Lamont, previ- ously an employee and protégé of William C. Whitney. Finally, the second Secretary of the Navy was an Alabama Congressman, Hilary A. Herbert, an aorney for and very close friend of Mayer Lehman, a founding partner of the New York mercantile firm of Lehman Brothers, soon to move heavily into investment banking. Indeed, Mayer’s son, Herbert, later to be Governor of New York during the New Deal, was named aer Hilary Herbert. e great turning point of American foreign policy came in the early 1890s, during the second Cleveland administration. It was then that the U.S. turned sharply and permanently from a foreign policy of peace and non-intervention to an aggressive"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"J. P. MORGAN 5 program of economic and political expansion abroad. At the heart of the new policy were America’s leading bankers, eager to use the country’s growing economic strength to subsidize and force-feed export markets and investment outlets that they would finance, as well as to guarantee ird World government bonds. e major focus of aggressive expansion in the 1890s was Latin America, and the principal Enemy to be dislodged was Great Britain, which had dominated foreign investments in that vast region. In a notable series of articles in 1894, Bankers’ Magazine set the agenda for the remainder of the decade. Its conclusion: if “we could wrest the South American markets from Germany and Eng- land and permanently hold them, this would be indeed a conquest worth perhaps a heavy sacrifice.” Longtime Morgan associate Richard Olney heeded the call, as Secretary of State from 1895 to 1897, seing the U.S. on the road to Empire. Aer leaving the State Department, he publicly sum- marized the policy he had pursued. e old isolationism heralded by George Washington’s Farewell Address is over, he thundered. e time has now arrived, Olney declared, when “it behooves us to accept the commanding position ... among the Power of the earth.” And, “the present crying need of our commercial inter- ests,” he added, “is more markets and larger markets” for Ameri- can products, especially in Latin America. Good as their word, Cleveland and Olney proceeded belliger- ently to use U.S. might to push Great Britain out of its markets and footholds in Latin America. In 1894, the United States Navy illegally used force to break the blockade of Rio de Janeiro by a British-backed rebellion aiming to restore the Brazilian monar- chy. To insure that the rebellion was broken, the U.S. Navy sta- tioned warships in Rio harbor for several months. During the same period, the U.S. government faced a com- plicated situation in Nicaragua, where it was planning to guar- antee the bonds of the American Maritime Canal Company to build a canal across the country. e new regime of General"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"6 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Zelaya was threatening to revoke this canal concession; at the same time an independent reservation of Mosquito Indians, pro- tected for decades by Great Britain, sat athwart the eastern end of the proposed canal. In a series of de maneuvers, using the Navy and landing the Marines, the U.S. managed to bring Zelaya to heel and to oust the British and take over the Mosquito terri- tory. In Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic) France was the recipient of the American big stick. In the Santo Domingo Im- provement Company, in 1893, a consortium of New York bankers purchased the entire debt of Santo Domingo from a Dutch com- pany, receiving the right to collect all Dominican customs rev- enues in payment of the debt. e French became edgy the fol- lowing year when a French citizen was murdered in that country, and the French government threatened to use force to obtain repa- rations. Its target for reparations was the Dominican customs revenue, at which point the U.S. sent a warship to the area to intimidate the French. But the most alarming crisis of this period took place in 1895–96, when the U.S. was at a hair’s breadth from actual war with Great Britain over a territorial dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana. is boundary dispute had been raging for forty years, but Venezuela shrewdly aracted American inter- est by granting concessions to Americans in gold fields in the disputed area. Apparently, Cleveland had had enough of the “British threat,” and he moved quickly toward war.

Wars are inevitable, Dickinson declared, for they arise out of commer- cial competition between nations. e United States faces the danger of numerous conflicts, and clearly the enemy was Great Britain.

Insultingly, the Venezuelans received not a single seat on the agreed-upon arbi- tration commission.

Harriman and Kuhn, Loeb grabbed control of the Union Pacific Railroad and the two titanic forces baled to a draw for control of the Northern Pacific. Also, at about the same time, a long-lasting and worldwide financial and political “oil war” broke out between Standard Oil, previously a monopolist in both the crude and export markets outside of the U.S., and the burgeoning British Royal Dutch Shell–Rothschild combine. And since the Morgans and Rothschilds were longtime allies, it is certainly sensible to conclude—though there are no hard facts to prove it—that Teddy Roosevelt launched his savage anti-trust assault to break Standard Oil as a Morgan contribution to the worldwide struggle.

By 1914, the Morgan empire was in increasingly shaky finan- cial shape. e Morgans had long been commied to railroads, and aer the turn of the century the highly subsidized and reg- ulated railroads entered their permanent decline. e Morgans had also not been active enough in the new capital market for industrial securities, which had begun in the 1890s, allowing Kuhn, Loeb to beat them in the race for industrial finance. To make maers worse, the $400 million Morgan-run New Haven Railroad went bankrupt in 1914. At the moment of great financial danger for the Morgans, the advent of World War I came as a godsend. Long connected to British, including Rothschild, financial interests, the Morgans leaped into the fray, quickly securing the appointment, for J. P. Morgan & Co., of fiscal agent for the warring British and French governments, and monopoly underwriter for their war bonds in the United States. J. P. Morgan also became the fiscal agent for the Bank of England, the powerful English central bank. Not only that: the Morgans were heavily involved in financing American munitions and other firms exporting war material to Britain and France. J. P. Morgan & Co., moreover, became the central authority organizing and channeling war purchases for the two Allied nations. e United States had been in a sharp recession during 1913 and 1914; unemployment was high, and many factories were operating at only 60% of capacity.

Explosives exports to the Allies rose over ten-fold during 1915 alone. Overall, from 1915 to 1917, the export department of J. P. Morgan and Co. negotiated more than $3 billion of contracts to Britain and France. By early 1915, Secretary McAdoo was writing to Wilson hailing the “great prosperity” being brought by war exports to the Allies, and a prominent business writer wrote the following year that “War, for Europe, is meaning devastation and death; for America a bumper crop of new millionaires and a hectic hastening of prosperity revival.” Deep in Allied bonds and export of munitions, the Morgans were doing extraordinarily well; and their great rivals, Kuhn, Loeb, being pro-German, were necessarily le out of the Allied wartime bonanza. But there was one hitch: it became imperative that the Allies win the war. It is not surprising, therefore, that from the beginning of the great conflict, J. P. Morgan and his associates did everything they possibly could to push the supposedly neutral United States into the war on the side of England and France. As Morgan himself put it: “We agreed that we should do all that was lawfully in our power to help the Allies win the war as soon as possible.” Accordingly, Henry P.

Furthermore, Balfour leaked to Colonel House the details of various secret Al- lied treaties that they both knew the naïve Wilson would not accept, and they both agreed to keep the treaties from the Presi- dent. Similarly, soon aer the U.S. entered the war, the British sent to the U.S., as personal liaison between the Prime Minister and the White House, the young chief of British military intelligence, Sir William Wiseman. House and Wiseman quickly entered a close collaboration, with House coaching the Englishman on the best way of dealing with the President, such as “tell him only what he wants to hear,” never argue with him, and discover and exploit his weaknesses.

For- tuitously, an institution was established at the end of 1913 that made the loans and war finance possible: the Federal Reserve System. By centralizing reserves, by providing a government- privileged lender of last resort to the banks, the Fed enabled the banking system to inflate money and credit, finance loans to the Allies, and float massive deficits once the U.S. entered the war. In addition, the seemingly odd Fed policy of creating an acceptance market out of thin air by standing ready to purchase acceptance at a subsidized rate, enabled the Fed to rediscount acceptance on munitions exports. e Federal Reserve was the outgrowth of five years of plan- ning, amending, and compromising among various politicians and concerned financial groups, led by the major financial inter- ests, including the Morgans, the Rockefellers, and the Kuhn, Loebs, along with their assorted economists and technicians.

Britain’s predicament came from its insistence on going back to the gold standard aer the war at the highly overvalued pre-war par for the pound, and then insisting on inflating rather than deflating to make its exports competitively priced in the world market. Hence, Britain needed to induce other countries, particularly the U.S., to inflate along with it. e Strong-Norman-Morgan connection did the job, seing the stage for the great financial collapse of 1929–1931.

Also influential in helping the Truman administration orga- nize the Cold War was director of the policy planning staff of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ROCKEFELLER, MORGAN, AND WAR 37 the State Department, Paul H. Nitze. Nitze, whose wife was a member of the Pra family, associated with the Rockefeller fam- ily since the origins of Standard Oil, had been vice-president of Dillon, Read & Co. When Truman entered the Korean War, he created an Office of Defense Mobilization to run the domestic economy during the war. e first director was Charles E. (“Electric Charlie”) Wil- son, president of the Morgan-controlled General Electric Com- pany, who also served as board member of the Morgans’ Guar- anty Trust Company. His two most influential assistants were Sidney J. Weinberg, ubiquitous senior partner in the Wall Street investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs & Co., and former General Lucius D. Clay, chairman of the board of Continental Can Co., and a director of the Lehman Corporation. Succeeding McCloy as President of the World Bank, and con- tinuing in that post throughout the two terms of Dwight Eisen- hower, was Eugene Black. Black had served for fourteen years as vice-president of the Chase National Bank, and was persuaded to take the World Bank post by the bank’s chairman of the board, Winthrop W. Aldrich, brother-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. e Eisenhower administration proved to be a field day for the Rockefeller interests. While president of Columbia University, Eisenhower was invited to high-level dinners where he met and was groomed for President by top leaders from the Rockefeller and Morgan ambits, including the chairman of the board of Rock- efeller’s Standard Oil of New Jersey, the presidents of six other big oil companies, including Standard of California and Socony- Vacuum, and the executive vice-president of J. P. Morgan & Co. One dinner was hosted by Clarence Dillon, the multi-million- aire retired founder of Dillon, Read & Co., where the guests in- cluded Russell B. Leffingwell, chairman of the board of both J. P. Morgan & Co. and the CFR (before McCloy); John M. Schiff, a senior partner of the investment banking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; the financier Jeremiah Milbank, a director of the Chase Man- haan Bank; and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Even earlier, during 1949,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"38 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Eisenhower had been introduced through a special study group to key figures in the CFR. e study group devised a plan to create a new organization called the American Assembly—in essence an expanded CFR study group—whose main function was reputedly to build up Eisenhower’s prospects for the Presidency. A leader of the “Citizens for Eisenhower” commiee, who later became Ike’s Ambassador to Great Britain, was the multi-millionaire John Hay Whitney, scion of several wealthy families, whose grandun- cle, Oliver H. Payne, had been one of the associates of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. in founding the Standard Oil Company. Whitney was head of his own investment concern, J. H. Whitney & Co., and later became publisher of the New York Herald Tribune . Running foreign policy during the Eisenhower administration was the Dulles family, led by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had also concluded the U.S. peace treaty with Japan under Harry Truman. Dulles had for three decades been a senior partner of the top Wall Street corporate law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, whose most important client was Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Com- pany of New Jersey. Dulles had been for fieen years a member of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and before assuming the post of Secretary of State was chairman of the board of that institution. Most important is the lile-known fact that Dulles’s wife was Janet Pomeroy Avery, a first cousin of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Heading the super-secret Central Intelligence Agency during the Eisenhower years was Dulles’s brother, Allen Welsh Dulles, also a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell. Allen Dulles had long been a trustee of the CFR and had served as its president from 1947 to 1951. eir sister, Eleanor Lansing Dulles, was head of the Berlin desk of the State Department during that decade. Under-Secretary of State, and the man who succeeded John Foster Dulles in the spring 1959, was former Massachuses Gover- nor Christian A. Herter. Herter’s wife, like Nitze’s, was a member of the Pra family. Indeed, his wife’s uncle, Herbert L. Pra, had been for many years president or chairman of the board"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ROCKEFELLER, MORGAN, AND WAR 39 of Standard Oil Company of New York. One of Mrs. Herter’s cousins, Richardson Pra, had served as assistant treasurer of Standard Oil of New Jersey up to 1945. Furthermore, one of Herter’s own uncles, a physician, had been for many years trea- surer of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Herter was succeeded as Under-Secretary of State by Eisen- hower’s Ambassador to France, C. Douglas Dillon, son of Clarence, and himself Chairman of the Board of Dillon, Read & Co. Dillon was soon to become a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. Perhaps to provide some balance for his banker-business coali- tion, Eisenhower appointed as Secretary of Defense three men in the Morgan rather than the Rockefeller ambit. Charles B. (“En- gine Charlie”) Wilson was president of General Motors, member of the board of J. P. Morgan & Co. Wilson’s successor, Neil H. McElroy, was president of Proctor & Gamble Co. His board chair- man, R. R. Deupree, was also a director of J. P. Morgan & Co. e third Secretary of Defense who had been Under-Secretary and Secretary of the Navy under Eisenhower, was omas S. Gates, Jr., who had been a partner of the Morgan-connected Philadelphia investment banking firm of Drexel & Co. When Gates stepped down as Defense Secretary, he became president of the newly formed flagship commercial bank for the Morgan interests, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. Serving as Secretary of the Navy and then Deputy Secretary of Defense (and later Secretary of the Treasury) under Eisen- hower was Texas businessman Robert B. Anderson. Aer leaving the Defense Department, Anderson became a board member of the Rockefeller-controlled American Overseas Investing Co., and, before becoming Secretary of the Treasury, he borrowed $84,000 from Nelson A. Rockefeller to buy stock in Nelson’s International Basic Economy Corporation. Head of the important Atomic Energy Commission during the Eisenhower years was Lewis L. Strauss. For two decades, Strauss had been a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. In 1950, Strauss had become financial adviser"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"40 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY to the Rockefeller family, soon also becoming a board member of Rockefeller Center, Inc. A powerful force in deciding foreign policy was the National Security Council, which included on it the Dulles brothers, Strauss, and Wilson. Particularly important is the post of national secu- rity adviser to the President. Eisenhower’s first national security adviser was Robert Cutler, president of the Old Colony Trust Co., the largest trust operation outside New York City. e Old Colony was a trust affiliate of the First National Bank of Boston. Aer two years in the top national security post, Cutler re- turned to Boston to become chairman of the board of Old Colony Trust, returning aer a while to the national security slot for two more years. In between, Eisenhower had two successive na- tional security advisers. e first was Dillon Anderson, a Houston corporate aorney, who did work for several oil companies. Par- ticularly significant was Anderson’s position as chairman of the board of a small but fascinating Connecticut firm called Electro- Mechanical Research, Inc. Electro-Mechanical was closely asso- ciated with certain Rockefeller financiers; thus, one of its direc- tors was Godfrey Rockefeller, a limited partner in the investment banking firm of Clark, Dodge & Co. Aer more than a year, Anderson resigned from his national security post and was replaced by William H. Jackson, a partner of the investment firm of J. H. Whitney & Co. Before assuming his powerful position, Dillon Anderson had been one of several men serving as special hush-hush consultants to the National Security Council. Another special adviser was Eugene Holman, president of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. We may mention two important foreign policy actions of the Eisenhower administration which seem to reflect the strik- ing influence of personnel directly tied to bankers and financial interests. In 1951, the regime of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran de- cided to nationalize the British-owned oil holdings of the Anglo- Iranian Oil company. It took no time for the newly established Eisenhower administration to intervene heavily in this situation."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ROCKEFELLER, MORGAN, AND WAR 41 CIA director and former Standard Oil lawyer Allen W. Dulles flew to Switzerland to organize the covert overthrow of the Mossadegh regime, the throwing of Mossadegh into prison, and the restoration of the Shah to the throne of Iran. Aer lengthy behind-the-scenes negotiations, the oil industry was put back into action as purchasers and refiners of Iranian oil. But this time the picture was significantly different. Instead of the British geing all of the oil pie, their share was reduced to 40 percent of the new oil consortium, with five top U.S. oil com- panies (Standard Oil of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum—formerly Standard Oil of N.Y., and now Mobil—Standard Oil of California, Gulf, and Texaco) geing another 40 percent. It was later disclosed that Secretary of State Dulles placed a sharp upper limit on any participation in the consortium by smaller independent oil companies in the United States. In addi- tion to the rewards to the Rockefeller interests, the CIA’s man-on- the-spot directing the operation, Kermit Roosevelt, received his due by quickly becoming a vice-president of Mellon’s Gulf Oil Corp."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"e Guatemalan Coup Fresh from its CIA triumph in Iran, the Eisenhower administra- tion next turned its aention to Guatemala, where the le-liberal regime of Jacob Arbenz Guzman had nationalized 234,000 acres of uncultivated land owned by the nation’s largest landholder, the American-owned United Fruit Company, which imported about 60 percent of all bananas coming into the United States. Arbenz also announced his intention of seizing another 173,000 acres of idle United Fruit land along the Caribbean coast. In late 1953, Eisenhower gave the CIA the assignment of organizing a counter-revolution in Guatemala. With the actual operation directed by former Wall Street corporate lawyer Frank Wisner of the CIA, the agency launched a successful invasion of Guatemala, led by exiled Army Colonel Castilo Armas, which soon overthrew the Arbenz regime and replaced it with a military junta. e Arbenz land program was abolished, and most of its expropriated property was returned to the United Fruit Company. Allen W. Dulles had financial connections with United Fruit and with various sugar companies which had also suffered land expropriation from the Arbenz regime. For several years, while a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, he had been a board member of the Rockefeller-controlled J. Henry Schroder Banking Corpo- ration. Members of the board of Schroder during 1953 included Delano Andrews, Sullivan & Cromwell partner who had taken Dulles’s seat on the board; George A. Braga, president of the 43"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"44 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Manati Sugar Company; Charles W. Gibson, vice-president of the Rockefeller-affiliated Air Reduction Company; and Avery Rocke- feller, president of the closely linked banking house of Schroder, Rockefeller, & Co. Members of the board of Manati Sugar, in the meanwhile, included Alfred Jaretski, Jr., another Sullivan & Cromwell partner; Gerald F. Beal, president of J. Henry Schroder and chairman of the board of the International Railways of Cen- tral America; and Henry E. Worcester, a recently retired of exec- utive of United Fruit. United Fruit, furthermore, was a controlling shareholder in International Railways, while, as in the case of Beal, the board chairmanship of the railway had long been held by a high offi- cial of Schroder. e close ties between United Fruit, Schroder, and International Railways may also be seen by the fact that, in 1959, the board chairman of the railway became James McGov- ern, general counsel for United Fruit. International Railway, in fact, carried most of United Fruit’s produce from the interior to the port in Guatemala. In addition, Dulles’s close associate and fellow trustee of the Council of Foreign Relations in this period, and former treasurer of the CFR, was Whitney H. Shepardson, formerly vice-president of International Railways. Not only that: Robert Cutler, national security adviser to the President at the time of the coup against Arbenz, had himself very close ties to United Fruit. Cutler’s boss at Old Colony Trust, chairman of the board T. Jefferson Coolidge, was also, and more importantly, board chairman at United Fruit. Indeed, many mem- bers of the board of United Fruit, a Boston-based company, were also on the board of Old Colony or its mother company, the First National Bank of Boston. Furthermore, during the period of planning the Guatemalan coup, and up till a few months before its success in 1954, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs was John Moors Cabot, a well-known anti-Arbenz hawk. Cabot’s brother omas D., was an executive of United Fruit and a member of the board of the First National Bank of Boston."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE GUATEMALAN COUP 45 e Council on Foreign Relations played an important role in the Guatemalan invasion. It began in the fall of 1952, when Spruille Braden, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter- American Affairs and then consultant for United Fruit, led a CFR study group on Political Unrest in Latin America. Discussion leader at the first meeting of the CFR-Braden group was John McClintock, an executive of United Fruit. Former leading New Dealer and Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle, Jr., a par- ticipant in the study group, recorded in his diary that the U.S. should welcome an overthrow of the Arbenz government, and noted that, “I am arranging to see Nelson Rockefeller (himself Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs during World War II) who knows the situation and can work a lile with General Eisenhower.” In the actual Guatemalan operation, President Eisenhower himself was a CFR member, as were Allen Dulles, John M. Cabot and Frank Wisner, the man in charge of the coup and the CIA’s deputy director for plans. Of the twelve people in the U.S. gov- ernment identified as being involved at the top level in the Guate- malan affair, eight were CFR members or would be within a few years. ese included, in addition to the above, Henry F. Holland, who succeeded Cabot in the assistant secretary of state slot in 1954; Under-Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith, a former director of the CIA; and Ambassador to the UN Henry Cabot Lodge. Paving the way for the coup was a public report, issued in December 1953 by the Commiee on International Policy of the National Planning Association on the Guatemalan situ- ation. Head of the Commiee was Frank Altschul, secretary and vice-president of the CFR and a partner of the international banking house of Lazard Frères, as well as a director of the Chase National Bank and president of the General American Investor Corp., a firm largely controlled by Lehman Brothers. e Altschul report, signed by twenty-two commiee members of whom fieen were CFR members, warned that “Communist"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"46 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY infiltration in Guatemala” was a threat to the security of the West- ern Hemisphere and hinted that drastic action would probably be necessary to deal with this menace. Of those involved in the drastic action, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, while at Sullivan & Cromwell, had once rep- resented United Fruit in negotiating a contract with Guatemala. Under-Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith, aer leaving the government, became director of United Fruit, as did Robert D. Hill, who participated in the Guatemala operation as Ambas- sador to Costa Rica. Furthermore, future president of Guatemala Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes noted that his own cooperation in the coup against Arbenz was obtained by Walter Turnbull, a former executive at United Fruit, who came to him along with two CIA agents."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"JFK and the Establishment When John F. Kennedy assumed the office of President, the first person he turned to for foreign policy advice was Robert A. Love, partner of Brown Brothers, Harriman, even though Love had backed Richard Nixon.

It was at Love’s urging, however, that Kennedy chose as Secretary of State Dean Rusk, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, a post he had acquired because of the strong backing of John Foster Dulles. Under-Secretary of State was Chester Bowles, a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation; Bowles was soon replaced by corporate lawyer George Bail, who was later to become a senior managing partner at Lehman Brothers. For Secretary of Defense Kennedy chose Robert S. McNamara, President of Ford Motor Company. One influential force in the McNamara appointment was the backing of Sidney J. Weinberg, partner of the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs, & Co. and powerful fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. Weinberg was a member of the board of Ford Motor Company. Perhaps even more important was the intimate Ford connection with the investment banking house of Lehman Brothers, which had long carried great weight in the party; at that time, five high-ranking Ford executives sat on the board of the One William Street Fund, a mutual fund recently established by Lehman Brothers. 47"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"48 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Secretary of the Air Force was Eugene Zuckert, chairman of the board of the small Pisburgh firm, the Nuclear Science and Engineering Corp., controlled by the powerful Lehman Brothers. Before going to this firm, Zuckert had been a member of the Atomic Energy Commission; former ABC Commissioner Gordon Dean, who had preceded Zuckert as chairman of the board of Nuclear Science and Engineering, was also a partner of Lehman Brothers. General counsel of the Defense Department, and soon to become Secretary of the Army, was Wall Street corporate lawyer Cyrus Vance, later to become Secretary of State under Carter. Vance’s law firm—Simpson, acher & Bartle—represented Lehman Brothers and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. More- over, Vance had married into New York’s wealthy W. & J. Sloane family; his father-in-law, John Sloane, had served as a director of the United States Trust Co. Secretary of the Treasury in the Kennedy Cabinet was C. Dou- glas Dillon, of Dillon, Read and the Rockefeller Foundation. Dil- lon saw no problem in serving for eight years as Ambassador to France and as a State Department official during the Eisenhower Era, and then segueing to the Democratic Kennedy Cabinet. Like Love, he too was chosen even though he had been a big contrib- utor to the Nixon effort of 1960. In the powerful post of National Security Adviser, Kennedy selected Harvard Dean McGeorge Bundy, who had been part of a high-powered foreign policy team advising omas B. Dewey in the 1948 campaign, a virtually all-Rockefeller dominated team headed by John Foster Dulles and including Dulles’s brother Allen, C. Douglas Dillon, and Christian Herter. Aer that, Bundy worked for the Council on Foreign Relations. Bundy had been born into the wealthy Boston Brahmin Low- ell family, his mother having been a Lowell. His father Harvey H. Bundy, was a partner in Boston’s top law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart, a high official of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, and a director of the Merchants National Bank of Boston.

Dulles as head of the CIA. It was at the urging of Dulles that Kennedy decided to go ahead with the CIA’s previously planned and disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Fidel Castro’s regime had recently nationalized a large number of American-owned sugar companies in Cuba. It might be noted that Dulles’s old law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell served as general counsel for two of these large sugar companies, the Francisco Sugar Co. and the Manati Sugar Co., and that one of the board members of these firms was Gerald F. Beal, president of the Rockefeller-oriented J. Henry Schroder Bank, of which Dulles had once been a director. Not only that. John L. Loeb of the Loeb, Rhoades investment bank, whose wife was a member of the Lehman banking family, owned a large block of stock in the nationalized Compania Azu- carera Atlantica del Golfo, a big sugar plantation in Cuba, while one of the directors of the laer company was Harold F. Lin- der, vice-chairman of the General American Investors Company, dominated by Lehman Brothers and Lazard Frères investment bankers. Linder was appointed head of the Export-Import Bank by President Kennedy. Aer the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Dulles was replaced as head of the CIA by West Coast industrialist John A. McCone, who also had the capacity to serve the administrations of either party with equal ease. Under-Secretary of the Air Force under Truman and head of the Atomic Energy Commission under Eisenhower, Mc- Cone was president of the Bechtel-McCone Corporation, and rep- resents the first major incursion of the international Bechtel con- struction interests into American politics. McCone was also a board member of the California Bank of Los Angeles, and of the Rockefeller-dominated Standard Oil Company of California. e CIA was also heavily involved about this time in the short- lived Katanga secession movement in the old Belgian Congo. One of the largest of the American companies in Katanga, and a major"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"50 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY backer of the secession movement, was the Anglo-American Cor- poration of South Africa, one of whose partners was mining mag- nate Charles W. Engelhard. Engelhard’s investment banker was Dillon, Read, the family firm of Kennedy’s Secretary of the Trea- sury, C. Douglas Dillon. We have seen that Mr. Establishment, the Rockefeller-oriented John J. McCloy, served as Kennedy’s special adviser on disarma- ment. When the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was created in the fall of 1961, its first head was William C. Foster, former Under-Secretary of State and Defense under Tru- man. In between, Foster had served as a high official of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp., and then board chairman of the Rockefeller-dominated United Nuclear Corp. Foster was also a director of the CFR. Kennedy continued Rockefeller’s Eugene Black as head of the powerful World Bank. When Black reached retirement age in 1962, he was replaced by George D. Woods, chairman of the board of the prominent investment bank, First Boston Corporation. Woods had many connections with the Rockefeller interests, including being a director of the Chase International Investment Corp., of the Rockefeller Foundation, and of other Rockefeller- dominated concerns. Two important foreign policy actions of the Kennedy adminis- tration were the Cuban Missile Crisis and the escalation of the war in Vietnam. Kennedy was advised during the Cuban missile crisis by an ad hoc group called the Ex Comm, which included, along with his official major foreign policy advisers, Robert A. Love and John J. McCloy. In the Vietnam War, Kennedy brought in as Ambassador to South Vietnam the Boston Brahmin and Morgan- oriented Henry Cabot Lodge, who had been Eisenhower’s Ambas- sador to the United Nations and who had run for Vice-President on the Nixon ticket in 1960.

As newly minted Vietnam doves were ousted from foreign policy positions, they were replaced by hawks. us, William Bundy became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, at the same time becoming a director of the CFR. On the other hand, the increasingly critical W. Averell Harriman was ousted from his post of Under-Secretary of State. Cyrus Vance continued as Johnson’s Secretary of the Army; when he rose to Deputy Secretary of Defense, he was replaced by Vance’s old friend and roommate at Yale, Stanley R. Resor.

Dean, a partner in Rockefeller-oriented Sullivan & Cromwell and a director of the CFR; and the ubiquitous John J. McCloy. Shortly aer the meeting, a distinguished national commiee of power elite figures was formed to back President Johnson’s aggressive policies in Vietnam. Chairman of the commiee was Arthur H. Dean; other members were Dean Acheson; Eugene Black, who, aer retiring as head of the World Bank, returned to be a director of Chase Manhaan; Gabriel Hauge of Manufactur- ers’ Trust and the CFR; David Rockefeller, president of the Chase Manhaan Bank and a vice-president of the CFR; and two board members of AT&T, William B. Murphy and James R. Killian, Jr. Indeed, of the 46 members of this pro-Vietnam War commiee, 19 were prominent businessmen, bankers or corporate lawyers. Later, when Johnson needed to raise taxes to supply more funds for the war effort, he selected thirteen businessmen to head the lobbying effort. A fascinating aspect of the Johnson administration was the heavy influence of men connected with the powerful Democratic investment banking house of Lehman Brothers. Johnson’s first Under-Secretary of State, George Ball, who le because of increas- ing disillusionment with the Vietnam War, would later become a key partner of Lehman Brothers.

Another very close and influential Johnson adviser, and a con- sistent hard-liner on Vietnam, was his old friend Abe Fortas, a Washington lawyer and veteran New Dealer. During the John- son years, Fortas served as director, vice-president, and general counsel for the Texas-based GreatAmerica Corp., a giant holding company controlling several insurance companies, Braniff Air- ways, and two banks, including the First Western Bank and Trust Co. of California. During the same period, Fortas was also a director and vice- president of the large Federated Department Stores. Both Fed- erated and GreatAmerica had close ties with Lehman Brothers. Fred Lazarus, Jr., a top official of Federated, sat on the board of the Lehman-controlled One William Street Fund, along with Edwin Weisl. And the only two non-Texans on the board of GreatAmer- ica Corp. were William H. Osborn, Jr., of Lehman Brothers, and Gustave L. Levy, a partner in the closely allied Wall Street invest- ment bank of Goldman, Sachs & Co. Goldman, Sachs was the senior banking adviser for the Murchison Texas oil interests, a group with whom Lyndon Johnson was personally allied. Finally, aer Henry Cabot Lodge retired as the hawkish Am- bassador to South Vietnam in 1967, he was replaced by Ellsworth Bunker. Bunker, who had been president of the National Sugar Refining Company, served as ambassador to various countries in the Eisenhower administration, and then Ambassador to the Organization of American States under Johnson.

While Bunker had served Johnson as Ambassador to the OAS, he continued to sit on the board of the National Sugar Refining Company. In late 1965, Bunker played a crucial role in Johnson’s massive U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic, an interven- tion into a Dominican civil war to prevent a victory by le-wing forces who would presumably pose a dire threat to American sugar companies in the republic. As President Johnson’s emissary to the Dominican Republic just aer the invasion, Bunker played a decisive role in installing the conservative Hector Garcia-Godoy as president. Increasingly, however, the power elite became divided over the morass of the Vietnam War. Under the blows of the Tet offen- sive in January 1968, Robert McNamara had become increasingly dovish and was replaced as Secretary of Defense by hard-liner Clark Clifford, with McNamara moving gracefully to take charge of the World Bank. But, on investigating the situation, Clifford, too, became critical of the war, and Johnson called a crucial two- day meeting on March 22, 1968, of his highly influential Senior Informal Advisory Group on Vietnam, known as the “Wise Men,” made up of all his key advisors on foreign affairs. Johnson was stunned to find that only Abe Fortas and Gen- eral Maxwell Taylor continued in the hard-line position. Arthur Dean, Cabot Lodge, John J. McCloy, and former General Omar Bradley took a confused middle-of-the-road position, while all the other elite figures such as Dean Acheson, George Ball, Mc- George Bundy, C.

Secretary of State William P. Rogers was a Wall Street lawyer who had long been active in the liberal Dewey-Rockefeller wing of the New York Republican Party. In- deed, omas E. Dewey was the main backer of Rogers for the State Department post. Dewey’s entire political career was beholden to the Rock- efeller interests, as was dramatically shown one election year when, in an incident that received unaccustomed publicity, Win- throp W. Aldrich, Rockefeller kinsman who was president of the Chase National Bank, literally ordered Governor Dewey into his Wall Street offices and commanded him to run for re-election. e governor, who had previously announced his retirement into private practice, meekly obeyed. Furthermore, Roger’s law partner, John A. Wells, had long been one of Nelson Rockefeller’s top political aides and had served as Nelson’s campaign manager for President in 1964. Second-tier posts in the Nixon State Department went to fi- nancial elite figures. us, the following men were successively Under Secretaries of State (aer 1972, Deputy Secretaries) in the Nixon White House: • Elliot L. Richardson, partner of a Boston Brahmin corporate law firm and a director of the New England Trust Co., and a man whose uncle, Henry L.

Kissinger But of course the dominant foreign policy figure in both the Nixon and Ford administrations was not William Rogers but Henry A. Kissinger, who was named national security adviser and soon became virtually the sole force in foreign policy, officially replacing Rogers as Secretary of State in 1973. Kissinger was virtually “Mr. Rockefeller.” As a Harvard polit- ical scientist, Kissinger had been discovered by John J. McCloy, and made director of a CFR group to study the Soviet threat in the nuclear age. He was soon made director of a special foreign policy studies project of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and from there became for more than a decade Nelson Rockefeller’s chief personal foreign policy adviser. Only three days before accepting the Nixon administration post, Rockefeller gave Kissinger $50,000 to ease the fiscal burdens of his official post. Nixon and Kissinger re-escalated the Viet- nam War by secretly bombing and then invading Cambodia in 1969 and 1970; they could be sure of compliance from Ellsworth Bunker, whom Nixon retained as Ambassador to South Vietnam until the end of the war. Apart from the Vietnam War, the Nixon administration’s ma- jor foreign policy venture was the CIA-led overthrow of the Marx- ist Allende regime in Chile. U.S. firms controlled about 80 per- cent of Chile’s copper production, and copper was by far Chile’s major export. In the 1970 election, the CIA funneled $1 million 57"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"58 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY into Chile in an unsuccessful aempt to defeat Allende. e new Allende regime then proceeded to nationalize large U.S.-owned firms, including Anaconda and Kenneco Copper and the Chile Telephone Co., a large utility which was a subsidiary of ITT (In- ternational Telephone and Telegraph Co.). Under the advice of Henry Kissinger and of ITT, the CIA fun- neled $8 million into Chile over the next three years, in an ulti- mately successful effort to overthrow the Allende regime. Par- ticularly helpful in this effort was John A. McCone, the West Coast industrialist whom Johnson had continued in charge of the CIA. Now a board member of ITT, McCone continued in constant contact by being named a consultant to the CIA on the Chilean question. President Nixon continued Johnson holdover Richard Helms as head of the CIA, and Helm’s outlook may have been influenced by the fact that his grandfather, Gates W. McGarrah, had been the head of the Mechanics and Metals National Bank of New York, director of Bankers Trust, and chairman of the board of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Of the $8 million poured into Chile by the CIA, over $1.5 mil- lion was allocated to Chile’s largest opposition newspaper, El Mercurio , published by wealthy businessman Augustin Edwards. Edwards was also, not coincidentally, vice president of Pepsico, a company headed by President Nixon’s close friend Donald M. Kendall. e transaction was arranged at a quiet breakfast meet- ing in Washington, set up by Kendall, and including Edwards and Henry Kissinger. Aer the successful overthrow of Allende by a military junta in September 1973, the man who became the first Minister of Economy, Development, and Reconstruction was Fernando Leniz, a high official of El Mercurio who also served on the board of the Chilean subsidiary of the Rockefeller-controlled International Basic Economy Corporation. Richard Nixon also established, for the first time, diplomatic relations with Communist China. Nixon was urged to take this step by a commiee of prominent businessmen and financiers interested in promoting trade with and investments in China. e"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"HENRY A.

More important than Bush’s Texas oil connections was the fact that his father, Connecticut Senator Presco Bush, was a partner at Brown Brothers, Harriman."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"e Trilateral Commission In July 1973 a development occurred which was to have a critical impact on U.S. foreign—and domestic—policy. David Rockefeller formed the Trilateral Commission, as a more elite and exclusive organization than the CFR, and containing statesmen, business- men, and intellectuals from Western Europe and Japan. e Trilateral Commission not only studied and formulated policy, but began to place its people in top governmental posts. North American secretary and coordinator for the Trilaterals was George S. Franklin, Jr., who had been for many years executive director of the CFR. Franklin had been David Rockefeller’s room- mate in college and had married Helena Edgell, a cousin of Rock- efeller. Henry Kissinger was of course a key member of the Tri- laterals, and its staff director was Columbia University political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was also a recently selected director of the CFR. President Ford continued Kissinger as his Secretary of State and top foreign policy director. Kissinger’s leading aide during the Ford years was Robert S. Ingersoll, Trilateralist from Borg- Warner Corp. and the First National Bank of Chicago. In 1974, Ingersoll was replaced as Deputy Secretary of State by Charles W. Robinson, a businessman and Trilateralist. Ambassador to Great Britain—and then moved to several other posts—was Elliot Richardson, now a Trilateralist and a director of the CFR. George Bush, Trilateralist, was retained as 61"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"62 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Ambassador to China, and then became director of the CIA. He was replaced as Ambassador by omas S. Gates, Jr., head of the Morgans’ flagship bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. Meanwhile, Robert McNamara continued to head the World Bank. Becom- ing head of the Export-Import Bank in 1975 was Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., who had had the distinction of being a partner of both Lehman Brothers and Lazard Frères. James Earl Carter and his administration were virtually com- plete creatures of the Trilateral Commission. In the early 1970s, the financial elite was looking for a likely liberal Southern gov- ernor who might be installed in the White House. ey were considering Reubin Askew and Terry Sanford, but they seled on the obscure Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter. ey were aided in their decision by the fact that Jimmy came highly recommended. In the first place, it must be realized that “Atlanta” has for decades meant Coca-Cola, the great multi-billion dollar corpo- ration which has long stood at the center of Atlanta’s politico- economic power elite. Jimmy Carter’s long-time aorney, close personal friend, and political mentor was Charles Kirbo, senior partner at Atlanta’s top corporate law firm of King & Spalding. King & Spalding had long been the general counsel to Coca- Cola, and also to the mighty financial firm e Trust Co. of Geor- gia, long known in Atlanta as “the Coca-Cola bank.” e long- time head and major owner of Coca-Cola was the octogenerian Robert W. Woodruff, who had long been highly influential in Geor- gia politics. With Kirbo at his elbow, Jimmy Carter soon gained the whole-hearted political backing of the Coca-Cola interests. Financial contributors to Carter’s race in the 1971 Demo- cratic primary for governor were: John Paul Austin, powerful chairman of the board of Coca-Cola; and three vice-presidents of Coke, including Joseph W. Jones, the personal assistant to Robert Woodruff. If Pepsi was a Republican firm, Coke had long been prominent in the Democratic Party; thus, James A. Farley, long-time head of the Democratic National Commiee, was for thirty-five years head of the Coca-Cola Export Company."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION 63 In 1971, Carter was introduced to David Rockefeller by the lat- ter’s friend J. Paul Austin, who was to become a founding member of the Trilateral Commission. Austin was long connected with the Morgan interests, and served as a director of the Morgan Guar- anty Trust Co., and of Morgan’s General Electric Co. Other early political backers of Jimmy Carter were the Gambrell brothers, David and E. Smyth, of a family which was a major stockholder in Rockefeller-controlled Eastern Air Lines. e Gambrell law firm, indeed, served as the general counsel for Eastern. ey, too, aided in forming the Carter-Rockefeller connection. During the same period, Carter was also introduced to the pow- erful Hedley Donovan, editor-in-chief of Time magazine, who was also to be a founding Trilateralist. Rockefeller and Donovan liked what they saw, and Carter was also recommended to the Trilaterals by the Atlanta Commiee of the Council on Foreign Relations. Jimmy Carter was invited to become a member of the Tri- lateral Commission shortly aer it was formed, and he agreed enthusiastically. Why did the Trilaterals appoint an obscure Geor- gia governor with admiedly no knowledge of foreign affairs? Ostensibly because they wanted to hear the views of a Southern governor. Far more likely, they were grooming him for the Pres- idency and wanted to instruct him in trilateralism. Carter took instruction well, and he wrote later of the many happy hours he spent siing at the feet of Trilateral executive director and international relations expert Zbigniew Brzezinski. What the unknown Carter needed more than even money for his 1975–1976 campaign for President was extensive and favor- able media exposure. He received it from the Trilateral-influenced Establishment media, led by Time ’s Hedley Donovan and Trilat- eral syndicated columnists Joseph Kra and Carl Rowan. Major New York Carter backers, who served on the Wall Street Commiee for Carter or hosted gatherings on his behalf, included Roger C. Altman, partner of Lehman Brothers, the chair- man of which, Peter G. Peterson, was a Trilateral member; banker John Bowles; C. Douglas Dillon, of Dillon, Read, who also served"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"64 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY as a member of the international advisory board of the Chase Manhaan Bank; and Cyrus Vance, a Trilateral founder and vice- chairman of the CFR. Furthermore, of the six national finance directors of Jimmy Carter’s costly pre-convention race for the Presidential nomina- tion, three were high officials at Lehman Brothers, one was a vice-president of Paine, Webber, another was a vice-president of Kidder, Peabody, and a sixth was the venerable John L. Loeb, senior partner of Loeb, Rhodes, & Co., and a Lehman by marriage. Other prominent business fundraisers for Carter’s election cam- paign included Walter Rothschild, who had married a member of the Warburg family of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and Felix Rohatyn, a partner of Lazard Frères. e Carter administration proved to be Trilateral through and through, especially in foreign affairs. Trilateral members holding high posts in the Carter administration included: • President, James Earl Carter; • Vice-President, Walter (“Fritz”) Mondale; • National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski; • Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, who was now chairman of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. Vance’s law firm of Simpson, acher & Bartle had long served as general counsel for Lehman Brothers and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Vance himself served up to 1977 as a director of IBM, the New York Times Co., and Lehman’s One William Street Fund. It perhaps also helped Vance’s cause that Simpson, acher & Bartle was the New York general counsel for Coca-Cola Co. • Deputy Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. is Los Angeles corporate lawyer had no diplomatic experience whatever for this high post, but his law firm of O’Melveny and Myers was a prominent one, and he acted as the Los Angeles aorney for IBM.

Small wonder, since Volcker had been an executive at the Chase Manhaan Bank, and was a director of the CFR and a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. • And finally, White House Advisor on Domestic and Foreign Policy, Hedley Donovan, formerly editor-in-chief of Time magazine. One of the first important Carter foreign policy actions was the negotiation of the Panama Canal treaty, giving the Canal to Panama, and seling the controversy in such a way that U.S. taxpayers paid millions of dollars to the Panama government so they could repay their very heavy loans to a number of Wall Street banks. One co-negotiator of the treaty was Ellsworth Bunker, who had been engaged in fruitless negotiations since 1974. e treaty was not concluded until Carter added as co-negotiator the Trilateralist Sol Linowitz, a senior Washington partner of the Wall Street corpo- rate law firm of Coudert Brothers, and a board member of Pan-Am Airways, the Marine Midland Bank of New York, and Time, Inc. e Marine Midland Bank itself held part of two bank consor- tium loans to Panama.

Another crucial foreign policy action of the Carter regime was the President’s reluctant decision to admit the Shah of Iran into the U.S., a decision that led directly to the Iran hostage crisis and the freezing of Iranian assets in the U.S. Carter was pressured into this move by the persistent lobbying of David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger, who might well have realized that a hostage crisis would ensue. As a result, Iran was prevented from pursuing its threat of taking its massive deposits out of Chase Manhaan Bank, which would have caused Chase a great deal of financial difficulty. In politics, one hand washes the other. Kissinger, by the way, was scarcely put back in the shadows when he le government office in 1977. He quickly became a director of the CFR, a member of the executive commiee of the Trilateral Commission, and chairman of the International Advi- sory Board of the Chase Manhaan Bank. While Ronald Reagan’s early campaigning included aacks on the Trilateral Commission, the Trilateralists have by now been assured that the Reagan administration is in safe hands. e signal was Reagan’s choice of Trilateralist George Bush, who had also become a director of the First International Bank of London and Houston, as Vice-President of the United States, and of Reagan’s post-convention reconciliation visit to Washington and to the home of David Rockefeller. Reagan’s most influential White House aides, like James A. Baker, had been top campaigners for Bush for President in 1980. e most influential corporate firm in the Reagan administra- tion is the California-based Bechtel Corporation. Bechtel vice- president and general counsel Caspar Weinberger, a Trilateralist, is Secretary of Defense, and fellow top Bechtel executive George Shultz, former board member of Borg-Warner Corp., General American Transportation Corp., and Stein, Roe & Farnham Bal- anced Fund, is Secretary of State."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"68 WALL STREET, BANKS, AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Trilateralist Arthur F. Burns, former Chairman of the Fed, is ambassador to West Germany, Paul Volcker has been reappointed as head of the Fed, and Henry Kissinger is at least partially back as head of a Presidential Commission to study the question of Central America. It is hard to see how the Trilateralists can lose in the 1984 elections. On the Republican ticket they have George Bush, the heir apparent to Ronald Reagan; and in the Democratic race the two front-runners, Walter Mondale and John Glenn, are both Tri- lateralists, as is Alan Cranston of California. And, as a long shot, John Anderson of the “National Unity Party” is also a Trilateral member. To paraphrase a famous statement by White House aide Jack Valenti about Lyndon Johnson, the Trilateralists and the financial power elite can sleep well at night regardless of who wins in 1984."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Bibliography Burch, Jr., Philip H.
