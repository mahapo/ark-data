I have myself been an avid reader of this literature, and it has un· doubtedly taught me to avoid many mistakes. It has made me very much aware that the task of constructing helpful theories is much more difficult than I once imagined and that there are many pit· falls difficult to avoid. But unfortunately, much of it also suggests that there is a simple and easily learned procedure which one only has to follow carefully to arrive at valuable results. Of this I am becoming less and less convinced . The real difficulty still seems to be that of clearly stating the problem to which one wishes to find an answer. And on this, I fear, all my study of works on scientific method has hardly helped me. Yet it seems to encourage large numbers of young, and not so young, adepts of my discipline to treat the prescriptions of scientific method as if they were cook- book recipes which, if strictly followed, are certain to produce a nourishing dish. Yet different problems require a very different procedure. If great advances have been made in some disciplines through the use of certain methods, this is no reason to expect that the same methods will be equally successful in other fields. In fact, the problems of such complex phenomena as we encounter in the bio- logical or social sciences probably require a very different ap- proach from that which has been so successful in the physical sciences. Among the thinkers who have made outstanding contri- butions to the peculiar problems raised by the science of human action , Ludwig von Mises has probably been the most acute and the most original in modern times.

But minor differences, even if it is they which make every indi- vidual contribution worthwhile, are not what I wish to stress here . Professor Rothbard's writings are undoubtedly most helpful con- tributions to a great tradition. That the present state of this tradi- tion, established by the large, systematic treatises that Mises com- pleted from the third to the seven th decade of this century, should be made accessible to the readers of the ninth in a condensed form by one of his best-authorized disciples is certainly to be much welcomed . The issues examined have undoubtedly lost nothing of their importance . Every educated person will in the coming years have to learn to understand wha t praxeology is and what its par- ticular methods are .

Introduction In our proper condemnation of scientism in the study of man, we should not make the mistake of dismissing science as well. For if we do, we credit scientism too highly and accept at face value its claim to be the one and only scientific method. If scientism is, as we believe it to be, an improper method, then it cannot be truly scientific. Science, after all, means scientia, correct knowledge; it is older and wiser than the positivist-pragmatist attempt to monopolize the term. Scientism is the profoundly unscientific attempt to transfer uncritically the methodology of the physical sciences to the study of human action. Both fields of inquiry must, it is true, be studied by the use of reason-the mind's identification of reality. But then it becomes crucially important, in reason, not to neglect the critical attribute of human action : that, alone in nature, human beings possess a rational consciousness. Stones, molecules, planets cannot choose their courses; their behavior is strictly and mechanically determined for them . Only human beings possess free will and consciousness: for they are conscious, and they can, and indeed must, choose their course of action. 1 To ignore this primordial fact about the nature of man-to ignore his volition, his free will-is to misconstrue the facts of reality and therefore to be profoundly and radically unscientific. Man's necessity to choose means that, at any given time, he is acting to bring about some end in the immediate or distant future, i.e., that he has purposes. The steps that he takes to achieve his ends are his means. Man is born with no innate knowledge of what ends to choose or how to use which means to attain them . 1 Human action, therefore, docs not occur apart from cause; human beings must choose at any given moment, although the contents of the choice are se/f- dc:tc:rminc:d. 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences 4 Having no inborn knowledg e of how to survive and prospe r, he must learn wha t ends and means to adopt, and he is liable to make errors along the way . But only his reasoning mind can show him his goals and how to attain them. We have already begun to build the firs t blocks of the many- storied edifice of the true sciences of man - and they are all grounded on the fact of man's volition.: On the formal fac t that man uses means to attain ends, we ground the science of praxeol - ogy, or economics; psychology is the study of how and why man chooses the contents of his ends; technology tells what concre te means will lead to various ends; and ethics employs all the data of the various sciences to guide man toward the ends he should seek to attain, and therefore, by imputation, toward his proper means . None of these disciplines can make any sense whatever on scien - tistic premises . If men are like stones, if they are not purposive beings and do not strive for ends, then there is no economics, no psychology, no ethics, no technology, no science of man whatever . %The sciences which deal with the funct ioning o r man's au tomatic ot gans - physioloay, anatomy, etc . -may be included in the: pbysical sciences, for they are not based on man's will - although even here, psycho somati c medicine traces definite causal relation s stemming from man 's choices ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2. The Problem of Free Will Before proceeding further, we must pause to consider the validity of free will, for it is curious that the determinist dogma has so often been accepted as the uniquely scientific position . And while many philosophers have demonstrated the existence of free will, the concept has all too rarely been applied to the \"social sciences.\" In the first place, each human being knows universally from introspection that he chooses. The positivists and behaviorists may scoff at introspection all they wish, but it remains true that the introspective knowledge of a conscious man that he is con- scious and acts is a fact of reality . What, indeed, do the deter- minists have to offer to set against introspective fact? Only a poor and misleading analogy from the physical sciences. It is true that all mindless matter is determined and purposeless. But it is highly inappropriate, and moreover question-begging, simply and uncri- tically to apply the model of physics to man. Why, indeed, should we accept determinism in nature? The reason we say that things are determined is that every existing thing must have a specific existence . Having a specific existence, it must have certain definite, definable, delimitable attributes, i.e., every thing must have a specific nature. Every being, then, can act or behave only in accordance with its nature, and any two beings c an interact only in accord with their respective natures. There- fore, the actions of every being are caused by, determined by, its nature. 3 3 S« Andrew G.

At very best, the application of determinism to man is just an agenda for the future. After several centuries of arrogant procla- mations, no determinist has come up with anything like a theory determining all of men's actions. Surely the burden of proof must rest on the one advancing a theory, particularly when the theory contradicts man's primary impressions. Surely we can, at the very least, tell the determinists to keep quiet until they can offer their determinations-including, of course, their advance determina- tions of each of our reactions to their determining theory . But the re is far more that can be said. Fo r determinism, as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of fre e will . If we are determined in the ideas we accept, then X, the determinist, is determined to believe in determinism, while Y, the believer in free will, is also deter mined to believe in his own doctrine. Since man's mind is, according to determinism, not free to think and come to conclu- sions about reality, it is absurd for X to try to convince Y or any- one else of the truth of determinism . In short . t he determinist mu st rely, for the spread of his ideas, on the nondetermined, free- will choices of others , on their free will to adopt or reject ideas .'

But, on their own grounds, their own knowledge of this deter- mining theory is itself determined. How then can they aspire to know all, if the extent of their own knowledge is itself determined, and therefore arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if our ideas are deter- mined, then we have no way of freely revising our judgments and of learning truth - whether the truth of determinism or of any· thing else.' Thus, the determinist, to advocate his doctrine, must place himself and his theory outside the allegedly universally deter- mined realm, i.e., he must employ free will. This reliance of deter- minism on its negation is an instance of a wider truth : that it is self-contradictory to use reason in any attempt to deny the validity of reason as a means of attaining knowledge. Such self-contra- diction is implicit in such currently fashionable sentiments as \"reason shows us that reason is weak,\" or \"the more we know, the more we know how little we know.' •• Some may object that man is not really free because he must obey natural Jaws. To say that man is not free because he is not 1 Phillips therefore calls this attribute of an rutiom a \"boomerang principle ... for even though we cast it away from us, it returns to us again,\" and illustrates by showing that an attempt to deny the Aristotelian law of noncontradiction must end by assuming it.

It is clearly absurd to employ as a definition of \"freedom\" the power of an entity to perform an impossible action, to violate its nature. 10 Determinists often imply that a man's ideas are necessarily de- termined by the ideas of others, of \"society.\" Yet A and B can hear the same idea propounded; A can adopt it as valid while B will not. Each man, therefore, has the free choice of adopting or not adopting an idea or value. It is true that many men may un- critically adopt the ideas of others; yet this process cannot regress infinitely . At some point in time, the idea originated, i.e., the idea was not taken from others but was arrived at by some mind inde- pendently and creatively . This is logically necessary for any given idea . \"Society,\" there fore, cannot dictate ideas . If someone grows up in a world where people generally believe that \"all redheads are demons,\" he is free, as he grows up, to rethink the problem and arrive at a different conclusion. If this were not true, ideas, once adopted, could never have been changed. We conclude , therefore, that true science decrees determinism for physical nature and free will for man, and for the same rea- son : that every thing must act in accordance with i ts specific nature . And since men are free to adopt ideas and to act upon them, it is never events or stimuli external to the mind that cause its ideas; rath er the mind freely adopts ideas about external events .

The deciding factor was the idea that people chose to adopt. What led the people to adopt particular ideas? Here the his- torian may enumerate and weigh various factors, but he must always stop short at the ultimate freedom of the will. Thus, in any given matter, a person may freely decide either to think about a problem independently or to accept uncritically the ideas offered by others. Certainly, most of the people, especially in abstract matters, choose to follow the ideas offered by the intellectuals. At the time of the Great Depression, there were a host of intellectuals offering the nostrum of statism or socialism as a cure for the de- pression, while very few suggested laissez-faire or absolute mon- archy. The realization that ideas, freely adopted, determine social in- stitutions, and not vice versa, illuminates many critical areas of the study of man. Rousseau and his host of modern followers, who hold that man is good but is corrupted by his institutions, must finally wither under the query: And who but men created these institutions? The tendency of many modern intellectuals to worship the primitive (also the childlike-especially the child \"progressively\" educated-the \"natural\" life of the noble savage of the South Seas, etc .) has perhaps the same roots. We are also told repeatedly that differences between largely isolated tribes and ethnic groups are \"culturally determined\": tribe X being intelli- gent or peaceful because of its X -culture; tribe Y, dull or warlike because of Y -culture. If we fully realize that the men of each tribe created its own culture (unless we are to assume its creation by some mystic deus ex mach ina), we see that this popular \"explana- tion\" is no better than explaining the sleep-inducing properties of opium by its \"dormitive power.\" Indeed, it is worse, because it adds the error of social determinism. It will undoubtedly be charged that this discussion of free will and determinism is \"one-sided\" and that it leaves out the alleged fact that all of life is multicausal and interdependent.

There is no other alternative , there is no middle ground. and therefore the fashionable eclecticism of modern scholarship must in this case yield to the hard realities of the Law of the Excluded Middle. If free will has been vindicated, how can we prove the existence of consciousness itself? The answer is simple: to prove means to make evident something not yet evident. Yet some propositions may be already evident to the self, i.e., self -evident. A self -evident axiom, as we have indicated, will be a proposition that cannot be contradicted without employing the axiom itself in the attempt. And the existence of consciousness is not only evident to all of us through direct introspection, but is also a fundamental axiom, for the very act of doubting consciousness must itself be performed by a consciousness. ll Thus, the behaviorist who spurns conscious- ness for \"objective\" laboratory data must rely on the conscious- ness of his laboratory associates to report the data to him.

The False Mechanical Analogies of Scientism The scientific method in the study of man is almost wholly one of building on analogies from the physical sciences. Some of the common mechanistic analogies follow. Man as Servomechanism: Just as Bertrand Russell, one of the leaders of scientism, reverses reality by attributing determinism to men and free will to physical particles, so it has recently become the fashion to say that modern machines \"think,\" while man is merely a complex form of machine, or \"servomechan- ism.\" .. What is overlooked here is that machines, no matter how complex, are simply devices made by man to serve man's purposes and goals; their actions are preset by their creators, and the machines can never act in any other way or suddenly adopt new goals and act upon them. They cannot do so, finally, because the machines are not alive and are therefore certainly not conscious. If men are machines, on the other hand, then the determinists, in addition to meeting the above critique, must answer the question: Who created men and for what purpose?-a rather embarrassing question for materialists to answer. •' Social Engineering: This term implies that men are no different from stones or other physical objects, and therefore that they should be blueprinted and reshaped in the same way as objects by ••see Mises, Thtory and History, p. 92. 15 \"A machine is a device: made by man.

An engineering model is an exact replica in miniature, i.e. , in exact quantitative proportion , of the relationships existing in the given structure in the real world; but the \"models\" of economic and political theory are simply a few equations and concepts which, at very best. could only approximate a few of the numer- ous relations in the economy or society. Measurement : The Econometric Society 's origina l motto was \"Science is measurement,\" this ideal having been transferred in- tact from the natural sciences .

In the first place, a mathematical equation implies the existence of quantities that can be equated, which in turn implies a unit of measurement for these quantities. Secondly, mathematical relations arefunctional; i.e., variables are interdependent, and identifying the causal variable depends on which is held as given and which is changed. This methodology is appropriate in physics, where entities do not themselves provide the causes for their actions but are instead de- termined by discoverable quantitative laws of their nature and the nature of the interacting entities . But in human action, the free- will choice of the human consciousness is the cause, and this cause generates certain effects. The mathematical concept of interdetermining \"function\" is therefore inappropriate. Indeed, the very concept of \"variable\" used so frequently in econometrics is illegitimate, for physics is able to arrive at laws only by discovering constants. The concept of \"variable\" only makes sense if there are some things that are not variable, but constant. Yet in human action, free will precludes any quanti- tative constants (including constant units of measurement). All attempts to discover such constants (such as the strict quantity theory of money or the Keynesian \"consumption function\") were inherently doomed to failure. Finally, such staples of mathematical economics as the calculus are completely inappropriate for human action because they assume infinitely small continuity; while such concepts may legi- timately describe the completely determined path of a physical particle, they are seriously misleading in describing the willed action of a human being. Such willed action can occur only in dis- crete, non-infinitely-small steps, steps large enough to be per- ceivable by a human consciousness . Hence the continuity assump- tions of calculus are inappropriate for the study of man. Other metaphors bodily and misleadingly transplanted from physics include equilibrium, elasticity, statics and dynamics, velocity of circulation, and friction . Equilibrium in physics is a state in which an entity remains; but in economics or politics there is never really such an equilibrium state existing; there is but a J3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences 14 tendency in that direction. Moreover, the term equilibrium has emotional connotations, and so it was only a brief step to the further mischief of holding up equilibrium as not only possible, but as the ideal by which to gauge all existing institutions. But since man, by his very nature , must keep acting, he cannot be in equilibrium while he lives, and therefore the ideal, being impossi- ble, is also inappropriate. The concept of friction is used in a similar way. Some econo- mists, for example, have assumed that men have \"perfect knowl- edge,\" that the factors of production have \"perfect mobility,\" etc . , and then have airily dismissed all difficulties in applying these absurdities to the real world as simple problems of \"friction,\" just as the physical sciences bring in friction to add to their .. perfect\" framework.

Axioms and Deductions The fundamental axiom, then, for the study of man is the exist- ence of individual consciousness, and we have seen the numerous ways in which scientism tries to reject or avoid this axiom . Not being omniscient, a man must learn; he must ever adopt ideas and act upon them, choosing ends and the means to attain these ends. Upon this simple fundamental axiom a vast deductive edifice can be constructed. Professor Ludwig von Mises has already done this for economics, which he has subsumed under the science of prax- eology: This centers on the universal formal fact that all men use means for chosen ends, without investigating the processes of the concrete choices or the justification for them. Mises has shown that the entire structure of economic thought can be deduced from this axiom (with the help of a very few subsidiary axioms). u Since the fundamental and other axioms are qualitative by nature, it follows that the propositions deduced by the laws of logic from these axioms are also qualitative . The laws of human action are therefore qualitative, and in fact it should be clear that free will precludes quantitative laws. Thus, we may set forth the absolute economic law that an increase in the supply of a good, given the demand, will lower its price; but if we attempted to prescribe with similar generality how much the price would fall, 24 1n Mises, Human Action.

Few discussions of the history of philosophy or scientific method fail to make the ritual attacks on old-fashioned argumentation from self-evident principles. And yet the disciples of scientism them - selves implicitly assume as self -evident not what cannot be contra - dicted, but simply that the me t hodology of phy sics is the only truly scientific methodology . This methodology, briefly , is to look at facts, then frame ever more general hypotheses to account for the facts, and then to test these hypotheses by experimentally verifying other deductions made from them. But this method is appropriate only in the physical sciences . where we begin by knowing external sense da ta and then proceed to our task of try - ing to find, as closely as we can, the causal laws of behavior of the entities we perceive . We have no way of knowing these laws directly ; but fortunately we may verify them by performing con- trolled laboratory experiments to test propositions deduced from them. In these experiment s we can vary one factor, while keeping all other relevant factors constant. Yet the process of accumulat- ing knowledge in physics is always rather tenuous; and, as has happened, as we become more and more abstract, there is greater possibility that some other explanation will be devised which fits more of the observed facts and which may then replace the older theory. In the study of human action, on the other hand, the proper procedure is the reverse. Here we begin with the primary axioms; we know that men are the causal agents, that the ideas they adopt by free will govern their actions. We therefore begin by fully knowing the abstract axioms, and we may then build upon them by logical deduction , introducing a few subsid iary axioms to limit the range of the study to the concrete applications we care about.

One of the reasons for the scientistic hatred of the axiomatic- deductive method is historical. Thus, Dr. E. C.

The germ of truth in the historical picture of the noble Galileo versus the antiscientific Church consists largely in two important errors of Aristotle: (a) he thought of physical entities as acting teleologically. and thus in a sense as being causal agents; and (b) he necessarily had no knowledge of the experimental method, which had not yet been developed, and therefore thought that the axiomatic-deductive-qualitative method was the only one appropriate to the physical as well as to the human sciences.

Science and Values: Arbitrary Ethics Having discussed the properly scientific, as contrasted to the scientistic, approach to the study of man, we may conclude by briefly considering the age-old question of the relationship be- tween science and values. Ever since Max Weber, the dominant position in the social sciences, at least de jure, has been Wert- jreiheit: that science itself must not make value judgments, but confine itself to judgments of fact, since ultimate ends can be only sheer personal preference not subject to rational argument . The classical philosophical view that a rational (i.e., in the broad sense of the term, a \"scientific\") ethic is possible has been largely dis- carded. As a result, the critics of Wertfreiheit, having dismissed the possibility of rational ethics as a separate discipline, have taken to smuggling in arbitrary, ad hoc ethical judgments through the back door of each particular science of man. The current fashion is to preserve a facade of Wertfreiheit, while casually adopting value judgments, not as the scientist's own decision, but as the consensus of the values of others. Instead of choosing his own ends and valuing accordingly, the scientist supposedly main- tains his neutrality by adopting the values of the bulk of society. In short, to set forth one's own values is now considered biased and \"nonobjective,\" while to adopt uncritically the slogans of other people is the height of \"objectivity .\" Scientific objectivity no longer means a man's pursuit of truth wherever it may lead, but abiding by a Gallup poU of other, less informed subjectivities.l' The attitude that value judgments are self-evidently correct be- cause \"the people\" hold them permeates social science.

And he believes that he thereby can take a value position without really committing himself to any values of his own.

Equi ty questions always involve value judg - ments, and tax structu res can be evaluated, from an equity stand · point, only in terms of their relative conformity with the: con · sensus of thought in the: particular society with respect to equity . 10 But the scientist cannot thereby escape making value judgments of his own. A man who knowingly advises a criminal gang on the best means of safe-cracking is thereby implicitly endorsing the end: safe-cracking. He is an accessory before the fact. An econo- mist who advises the public on the most efficient method of ob- taining economic equality is endorsing the end: economic equality . The economist who advises the Federal Reserve System how most exped itiously to manage the economy is thereby endorsing the existence of the system and its aim of stabilization. A political scientist who advises a government bureau on how to reorganize its staff for greater efficiency (or less inefficiency} is thereby en- dorsing the existence and the success of that bureau.

Economics abounds in instances of arbitrary values smuggled into ·works the authors of which would never think of engaging in ethical analysis or propounding an ethical system.

Taxation is a realm where arbitrary values flourish, and we may illustrate by analyzing the most hallowed and surely the most commonsensical of all tax ethics: some of Adam Smith's famous canons of \"justice\" in taxation. 11 These canons have since been treated as self-evident gospel in practically every work on public finance. Take, for example, the canon that the costs of collection of any tax be kept to a minimum. Obvious enough to include in the most wertfrei treatise? Not at all-for we must not overlook the point of view of the tax collectors. They will favor high administrative costs of taxation, simply because high costs mean greater opportunities for bureaucratic employment. On what possible grounds can we call the bureaucrat \"wrong\" or \"unjust\"? Certainly no ethical system has been offered. Further- more, if the tax itself is considered bad on other grounds, then the opponent of the tax may well favor high administrative costs on the grounds that there will then be less chance for the tax to do damage by being fully collected. Consider another seemingly obvious Smith canon, viz., that a tax be levied so that payment is convenient. But again, this is by no means self-evident. Opponents of a tax, for example, may want the tax to be made purposely inconvenient so as to induce the people to rebel against the levy. Or another: that a tax be cer- tain and not arbitrary, so that the taxpayers know what they will have to pay. But here again, further analysis raises many prob- lems.

Conclusion Surveying the attributes of the proper science of man as against scientism, one finds a shining, clear thread separating one from the other . The true science of man bases itself upon the existence of individual human beings, upon individual life and conscious- ness. The scientific brethren (dominant in modern times) range themselves always against the meaningful existence of individuals: The biologists deny the existence of life, the psychologists deny consciousness, the economists deny economics, and the political theorists deny political philosophy. What they affirm is the exist- ence and primacy of social wholes: \"society,\" the \"collective,\" the \"group,\" the \"nation.\" The individual, they assert, must be value-free himself, but must take his values from \"society.\" The true science of man concentrates on the individual as of central, epistemological, and ethical importance; the adherents of scien- tism, in contrast, lose no opportunity to denigrate the individual and submerge him in the importance of the collective. With such radically contrasting epistemologies, it is hardly sheer coincidence that the political views of the two opposing camps tend to be indi- vidualist and collectivist, respectively. 27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"PART II: Praxeology as the Method of the Social Sciences"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"1. The Praxeological Method During the past generation, a veritable revolution has taken place in the discipline of economics. I am referring not so much to the well-known Keynesian revolution, but to the quieter yet more pro- found revolution in the methodology of the discipline . This change has not occurred simply in the formal writings of the handful of conscious methodologists; it has spread, largely un- noticed, until it now permeates research and study in all parts of the field. Some effects of this methodological revolution are all too apparent. Let the nonspecialist in economics pick up a journal article or monograph today and contrast it with one of a genera- tion ago, and the first thing that will strike him is the incompre- hensibility of the modern product. The older work was written in ordinary language and, with moderate effort, was comprehensi- ble to the layman ; the current work is virtually all mathematics , algebraic or geometric. As one distinguished economist has lamented, \"Economics nowadays often seems like a third-rate subbranch of mathematics,\" and one, he added, that the mathe- matician himself does not esteem very highly . Of course, economics shares this accelerated mathematization with virtually every other field of knowledge , including history and literature . But, laboring under the common notion that it is a science with a special focus on quantities, economics has pro- ceeded farther and faster than any of its sister disciplines down the mathematical and statistical road . The emphasis on mathematics is a symptom of a deeper change in the discipline: the rapid adoption of what we may broadly call \"positivism\" as the guide for research and the criterion for the successful construction of economic theory . The growing influ- ence of positivism has its source in the attempt of all social sciences to mimic the (allegedly) supremely successful science, 3l"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences physics . For social scientists, as for almost all intellectuals, physics has unfortunately all but replaced philosophy as the \"queen of the sciences . \" In the hands of the pos itivists, philoso- phy has almost come to seem an elaborate running commentary on and explication of physics, too often serving as the hand- maiden of that prestigious science . What positivists see as the methodology of physics has been elevated, at their hands, to be the scientific method, and any deviant approach has been barred from the status of science because it does not meet the rigorous positivist test. At the risk of overs i mp lifica t ion, the positivist model of the scientific method may be summarized as follows : Step 1. The scientist observes empirical regularities, or \"laws,\" between variables. Step 2. Hypothetical explanatory generalizations are constructed, from which the empirically observed laws can be deduced and thus \"explained. \" Step 3. Since competing hypotheses can be framed, each explain- ing the body of empirical laws, such \"coherence'' or consistent explanation is not enough; to validate the hypotheses, other de- ductions must be made from them, which must be \"testable\" by empirical observation. Step 4. From the construction and testing of hypotheses, a wider and wider body of generalizations is developed; these can be discarded if empirical tests invalidate them , ' or be replaced by new explanations covering a still wider range of phenomena. Since the number of variables is virtually infinite, the testing in Step 3, as well as much of the observation in Step 1, can only be done in \"controlled experiments,\" in which all variables but the ones under study are held constant. Replicating the experimental conditions should then replicate the results. Note that in this methodology we proceed from that which is known with certainty-the empirical regularities-up through even wider and more tentative hypotheses . It is this fact that leads the layman to believe erroneously that Newton \"overthrew\" his predecessors and was in his turn \"overthrown\" by Einstein. In 32 fact, what happens is not so much substitution as the addition of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Praxeology more general explanations for a wider range of phenomena; the generalizations of a Newton or an Einstein are far more tentative than the fact that two molecules of hydrogen combine with one molecule of oxygen to produce water. Now, I am not expert enough in the philosophy of science to challenge this positivist model of the methodology of physics, although my reading in the philosophy of nature leads me to suspect that it is highly inadequate. • My contention is rather that the wholesale and uncritical application of this model to econo- mics in recent decades has led the entire discipline badly astray. There is, however, unbeknownst to most present-day econ- omists, a competing methodological tradition. This tradition, the method of most of the older classical economists, has been called \"praxeology\" by Ludwig von Mises, its most eminent modern theorist and practitioner . Praxeology holds that in the social sciences where human beings and human choices are involved, Step 3 is impossible, since even in the most ambitious totalitarian society, it is impossible to hold all the variables constant . There cannot be controlled experiments when we confront the real world of human activity. Let us take a recent example of a generally unwelcome eco- nomic phenomenon: the accelerated price inflation in the United States in the last few years. There are all manner of competing theoretical explanations for this, ranging from increases in the money supply to a sudden increase in greed on the part of the public or various segments thereof. There is no positivist-empirical way of deciding between these various theories; there is no way of confirming or disproving them by keeping all but one sup- posedly explanatory variable constant, and then changing that variable to see what happens to prices. In addition, there is the well-known social science analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: positivist science contains predictions , but how can pre- dictions be tested when the very act of prediction itself changes the forces at work? Thus , economist A predicts a severe recession in six months; acting on this, the government takes measures to 1 0n this, see Andrew G. Van Melsen, The Philosophy of Nature (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1953) . 33"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Individu a lism and the Social Sciences combat the supposedly imminent recession, the public and the stock market react, and so on. The recession then never takes place. Does that mean that the economist was basing his predic- tion on erroneous theories, or that the theories were correct but inappropriate to the actual data, or that he was \" really\" right bu t that prompt action forestalled the dreaded event? There is no way to decide. One further example : Keynesian economists hold that depres- sions can be cured by massive doses of deficit spending by the government. The United States government engaged in large -scale deficit-spending to combat the depression in the late 1930s, but to no avail. The anti-Keynesians charge that this failure proves the incorrectness of Keynesian theory; the Keynesians reply that the doses were simply not massive enough, and that far greater deficits would have turned the tide. Again, there is no positivist- empirical way to decide between these compet ing claims. Praxeologists share the contention of the impossibility of em- pirical testing with other critics of positivism, such as the insti- tutionalists, who for this reason abandon economic theory al- together and confine themselves to purely empirical or institu- tional economic reportage. But the praxeologist does not despair; he turns instead to another methodology that can yield a correct body of economy theory . Th is methodology begins with the con- viction that while the economist, unlike the physicist, cannot test his hypotheses in controlled experiments, he is, in another sense, in a better position than the physicist. For while the physicist is certain of his empirical laws but tentative and uncertain of his ex- planatory generalizations, the economist is in the opposite posi- tion. He begins, not with detailed, quantitative, empirical regu- larities, but with broad explanatory generalizations. These funda- mental premises he knows with certainty; they have the status of apodictic axioms, on which he can build deductively with confi- dence . Beg inning with the certain knowledge of the basic explana- tory axiom A, he deduces the implications of A : B, C, and D. From these he deduces further implications, and so on. If he knows that A is true , and if A implies B, C, and D, then he knows with certainty that B, C, and D are true as well.

He therefore dismisses the praxeological approach as \"mythical\" and \"apriorist.\" What are these axioms with which the economist can so confi- dently begin? They are the existence, the nature, and the impli- cations of human action . Individual human beings exist . More- over, they do not simply \"move,\" as do unmotivated atoms or molecules; they act, i.e., they have goals and they make choices of means to attain their goals. They order their values or ends in a hierarchy according to whether they attribute greater or lesser importance to them; and they have what they believe is tech- nological knowledge to achieve their goals. All of this action must also take place through time and in a certain space. It is on this basic and evident axiom of human action that the entire structure of praxeological economic theory is built. We do not know, and may never know with certainty, the ultimate equation that will explain all electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena; but we do know that people act to achieve goals. And this knowledge is enough to elaborate the body of economic theory . 1 There is considerable controversy over the empirical status of the praxeological axiom . Professor Mises, working within a Kantian philosophical framework, maintained that like the \"laws of thought,'' the axiom is a priori to human experience and hence apodictically certain. This analysis has given rise to the designa- tion of praxeology as \"extreme apriorism . \" Most praxeologists, however, hold that the axiom is based squarely in empirical reality, which makes it no less certain than it is in Mises's formu- lation. If the axiom is empirically true, then the logical conse- quences built upon it must be empirically true as well. But this is not the sort of empiricism welcomed by the positivist, for it is 1 Thus the fact that people must act to achieve their goals implies that there is a scarcity of means to attain them; otherwise the: goals would already have been attained . Scarcity implies costs, which in a monetary system (developed much later in the logical elaboration) are renec:ted in prices, and so fonh .

The common-sense knowledge of the universality of motivated, intentional human action, ignored by positivists as \"unscientific,\" actually provides the indispens- able groundwork on which science itself must develop. 1 For Schutz this knowledge is empirical, \"provided that we do not re- strict this term to sensory perceptions of objects and events in the outer world but include the experiential form, by which common- sense thinking in everyday life understands human act ions and th eir outcome in terms of their underlying motives and goals. \"• The nature of the evidence on which the praxeological axiom rests is, moreover, fundamentally similar to that accepted by the self-proclaimed empiricists. To them, the laboratory experiment is evidence because the sensory experience involved in it is avail- able to each observer; the experience becomes \"eviden l\" to all. Logical proof is in this sense similar; for the knowledge tha t B 1 \"1t is . .. not understandable that the same authors who are convinced that no verification is possible for the intelligence of other human beings have such con- fidence in the principle of verifiability itself, which can be realized only through cooperation with others by mutual control .\" Alfred Schutz, Collected Papers, vol. 2, Studies in Social Theory, ed.

In the same way, the fact of human action and of purposive choice also becomes evident to each person who bothers to contemplate it; it is just as evident as the direct sense exper~ ience of the laboratory. From this philosophical perspective, then, all disciplines deal~ ing with human beings - from philosophy to history, psychology, and the social sciences - must take as their starting point the fact that humans engage in motivated, purposive action and are thus different from the unmotivated atoms and stones that are the objects of the physical sciences. But where, then, does praxeology or economics differ from the other disciplines that treat human beings? The difference is that, to the praxeologist, economic theory (as distinct from applied econom ics, which will be treated below) deals, not with the content of human valuations, motiva~ tions, and choices, but with the formal fact that people engage in such motivated action. Other disciplines focus on the content of these values and actions . Thus, psychology asks how and why people adopt values and make choices; ethics deals with the prob~ lem of what values and choices they should adopt; technology ex~ plains how they should act in order to arrive at chosen ends; and history tries to explain the content of human motives and choices through recorded time. Of these disciplines, history is perhaps the most purely verstehende, for the historian is constantly attempt~ ing to describe, understand, and explain the motivations and choices of individual actors. Economic theory, on the other hand, is the least verstehende, for while it too begins with the axiom of purposive and intentional human action, the remainder of its elaborated structure consists of the deduced logical-and there~ fore true-implications of that primordial fact. An example of the formal structure of economic theory is the well~known economic law, built up from the axiom of the exist~ ence of motivated human action , that if the demand for any product increases , given the existing supply, the price of that product will rise . This law holds regardless of the ethical or aesthetic status of the product, just as the law of gravity applies to objects regardless of their particular identity. The economic theorist is not interested in the content of what is being demanded, 37"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences or in its ethical meaning - it may be guns or butter or even text- books on philosophy. It is this universal, formal nature of econo- mic law that has earned it among laymen the reputation of being cold, heartless, and excessively logical. Having discussed the nature of the axiom on which the praxeo ~ logical view of economics is grounded, we may now turn to ex- amine the deductive process itself, the way in which the structure of economic laws is developed, the nature of those laws, and, finally, the ways in which the praxeological economist applies these economic laws to the social world. One of the basic tools for the deduction of the logical impli- cations of the axiom of human action is the use of the Gedanken- experiment , or \"mental expe r iment.\" The Gedankenexperiment is the economic theoris t 's substitute for the natural scientist's con- trolled laboratory experiment . Since the relevant variables of the social world cannot actually be held constant, the economist holds them constant in his imagination. Using the tool of verbal logic , he mentally investigates the causal influence of one variable on another. The economist finds , for example, that the price of a product is determined by two variables, the demand for it and its supply at any given time . He then mentally holds the supply con- stant , and finds that an increase in demand-brough t about by higher ran kings of the product o n t he value scales of the public - will bring about an increase in price. Similarly, he finds, again using verb al deductive logic , that if these value scales, and there- fore public demand, are mentally held constant, and the supply of the product increases, its price will fall . In short, economics arrives at ceteris paribus laws: Given the supply, the price will change in the same direction as demand; given the demand, price will change in the opposite direction from supply . One important aspect of these economic laws must be pointed out : They are necessarily qualitative . The fact that human beings have goals and preferences, that they make choices to a tt ain their goals, that all action must take place over time, all these are quali- tative axioms. And since only the qualitative enters into the logical process from the real world, only the qualitative can emerge. One can only say, for example, that an increase in de- 38 mand, given the supply, will raise the price; one cannot say that a"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Praxeology 20 percent increase in demand will bring about a 25 percent in- crease in price. The praxeologist must reject all attempts, no matter how fashionable, to erect a theory consisting of alleged quantitative laws. In an age that tries desperately to imitate pres- tigious physics, with its emphasis on mathematics and its quanti- tative laws, many social scientists, including many economists, have ignored this methodology because of this very insistence on the qualitative bounds of the discipline. There is a basic reason for the quantity-quality dichotomy be- tween the physical and the social sciences. The objects of physical science do not act; they do not choose, change their minds, and choose again . Their natures may therefore be investigated, and the investigations replicated indefinitely, with quantitative pre - cision. But people do change their minds, and their actions, all the time; their behavior cannot be predicted with exact and therefore scientific precision . Among the many factors helping to deter- mine the demand and the supply of butter, for example, are the valuations placed by each consumer on butter relative to all other products available, the availability of substitutes, the climate in the butter-producing areas, technological methods of producing butter (and margarine), the price of cattle feed, the supply of money in the country, the existence of prosperity or recession in the economy, and the public's expectations of the trend of gen- eral prices . Every one of these factors is subject to continuing and unpredictable change. Even if one mammoth equation could be discovered to \"explain\" all recorded prices of butter for the past SO years, there is no guarantee, and not even the likelihood, that the equation would have anything to do with next month's price . In fact, if empirical success is the test, it is surely noteworthy that all the determined efforts of quantitative economists, econo- metricians, and social scientists have not been able to find one single quantitative constant in human affairs. The mathematical laws in the physical sciences contain numerous constants; but the imitative method in the social sciences is proven vain by the fact that not a single constant has ever emerged. Moreover, despite the use of sophisticated econometric models and high-speed computers, the success rate of forecasting economic quantities has been dismal, even for the simplest of aggregates such as the Gross 39"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Ind ividualism and the Social Sciences National Product, let alone for more difficult quantities; the record of GNP forecasting by economists has been poorer than a simple layman's extrapolation of recent trends . s In fact, the federal government has had notably poor success even in fore- casting the one variable under its own absolute control-its own expenditure in the near future. Perhaps we will revise our critical opinion of econometric science if and when the econometricians prove themselves able to make flawless predictions of activity on the stock market-and make themselves vast fortunes in the process. Except for the fact that they are not quantitative, however, the predictions of the praxeologist are precisely the same kind as those of the natural scien tist. The latter, after all , is not a prophet or soothsayer; his successful prediction is not what will happen in the world, but what would happen if such and such should occur . The scientist can predict successfully that if hydrogen and oxygen are combined in proportions of two to one, the result will be water; but he has no way of predicting scientifically how many scientists in how many laboratories will perform this process at any given period in the future . In the same way, the praxeologist can say, with absolute certainty, that if the demand for butter increases, and the supply remains the same, the price of butter will rise; but he does no t know whether the public's demand for butter will in fact rise or fall, let alone by how much it will change. Like the physical scientist, the economist is not a prophet, and it is un- fortunate that the econometricians and quantitative economists should have so eagerly assumed this social role.'

The praxcologist contrasts, on the one hand, the body of qualitative, nomothetic laws developed by economic theory, and on the other, a myriad of unique, complex historical facts of both the past and the future. It is ironic that while the praxeologist is generally denounced by the positivist as an ''extreme apriorist,'' he actually has a far more empirical attitude toward the facts of history. For the positivist is always attempting to compress com- plex historical facts into artificial molds, regarding them as homogeneous and therefore manipulable and predictable by mechanical, statistical, and quantitative operations in the attempt to find leads, lags, correlations, econometric relations, and \"laws of history.\" This procrustean distortion is undertaken in the belief that the events of human history can be treated in the same mechanistic way as the movements of atoms or molecules- simple, unmotivated, homogeneous clements. The positivist not enable us to forecast accurately next year's output (still less the harvest in the more distant future) , which in the event will be affected by many factors besides changes in price . \" Peter T.

The praxeologist, in contrast, holds that each historical event is the highly complex result of a large number of causal forces, and, further, that it is unique and cannot be considered homogeneous to any other event. Obviously, there are similari- ties between events, but there is no perfect homogeneity and therefore no room for historical \"laws\" similar to the exact laws of physical science. While accepting that there are no mechanical laws of history, however, the praxeologist holds that he can and must use his knowledge of other nomothetic sciences as part of his verstehende attempt to understand and explain the idiographic events of history. Let us suppose that the economic historian, or the student of applied economics, is attempting to explain a rapid rise in the price of wheat in a certain country during a certain period. He may bring many nomothetic sciences to bear: The sciences of agronomy and entomology may help reveal that an insect men- tioned in the historical record was responsible for a drastic fall in wheat production; meteorological records may show that rainfall was insufficient; he may discover that during the period people's taste for bread increased, perhaps imitating a similar preference by the king; he may discover that the money supply was increas- ing, and learn from economic theory that an increase in the supply of money tends to raise prices in general, including therefore the price of wheat. And, finally, economic theory states that the price of wheat moves inversely with the supply and directly with the demand. The economic historian combines all of his scientific knowledge with his understanding of motives and choices to attempt to explain the complex historical phenomenon of the price of bread. A similar procedure is followed in the study of such infinitely more complex historical problems as the causes of the French Revolution, where, again, the historian must blend his knowledge of causal theories in economics, military strategy, psychology, technology, and so on, with his understanding of the motives and choices of individual actors. While historians may well agree on 42 the enumeration of all the relevant causal factors in the problem,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Praxeology they will differ on the weight to be attached to each factor. The evaluation of the relative importance of historical factors is an art, not a science, a matter of personal judgment, experience, and verstehende insight which will differ from one historian to another. In this sense, economic historians, like economists (and indeed other historians), can come to qualitative but not quanti- tative agreement. For the praxeologist, forecasting is a task very similar to the work of the historian. The latter attempts to \"predict\" the events of the past by explaining their antecedent causes; similarly, the forecaster attempts to predict the events of the future on the basis of present and past events already known. He uses all his nomo- thetic knowledge, economic, political, military, psychological, and technological; but at best his work is an art rather than an exact science. Thus, some forecasters will inevitably be better than others, and the superior forecasters will make the more successful entrepreneurs, speculators, generals, and bettors on elections or football games. The economic forecaster, as Professor Jewkes pointed out, is only looking at part of a tangled and complex social whole. To return to our original example, when he attempts to forecast the price of butter, he must take into consideration the qualitative economic law that price depends directly on demand and inversely on supply; it is then up to him, using knowledge and insight into general economic conditions as well as the specific economic, technological, political, and climatological conditions of the butter market, as well as the values people are likely to place on butter, to try to forecast the movements of the supply and demand of butter, and therefore its price, as accurately as possi- ble. At best, he will have nothing like a perfect score, for he will run aground on the fact of free will altering values and choices, and the consequent impossibility of making exact predictions of the future.• 1 We may mention here the well-known refutation of the notion of predicting the future by Karl Popper, namely, that in order to predict the future, we would have to predict what knowledge we will possess in the future. But we cannot do so, for if we knew what our future knowledge would be, we would already be in possession of that knowledge at the present time. See Karl R.

The Praxeological Tradition The praxeological tradition has a long history in economic thought. We will indicate briefly the outstanding figures in the development of that tradition, especially since these economic methodologists and their views have been recently neglected by economists steeped in the positivist world view. One of the first self-conscious methodologists in the history of economics was the early 19th century French economist Jean- Baptiste Say. In the lengthy introduction to his magnum opus, A Treatise on Political Economy. Say laments that people are too apt to suppose that absolute truth is confined to the mathe- matics and to the results of careful observation and experiment in the physical sciences; imagining that the moral and political sciences contain no invariable facts of indisputable truth, and therefore cannot be considered as genuine sciences, but merely hypothetical systems .... Say could easily have been referring to the positivists of our day, whose methodology prevents them from recognizing that absolute truths can be arrived at in the social sciences, when grounded, as they are in praxeology, on broadly evident axioms. Say insists that the \"general facts., underlying what he calls the \"moral sciences\" are undisputed and grounded on universal observation. Hence the advantage enjoyed by every one who, from distinct and accurate observation, can establish the existence of these general facts, demonstrate their conneltion, and deduce their conse- quences. They as certainly proceed from the nature of things as the Jaws of the material world. We do not imagine them; they are results disclosed to us by judicious observation and analysis. , • , That can be admitted by every reflecting mind. 4S"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences These general facts, according to Say, are \"principles,\" and the science of political economy, in the same manner ns the exact sciences, is composed of a few fundamental principles, and of a great number of corollaries or conclusions drawn from these principles. It is essential, therefore, for the advancement of this science that these principles should be strictly deduced from observation; the num · ber of conclusions to be drawn from them may afterwards be either multipled ot diminished at the discretion of the inquirer, according to the object he proposes.' Here Say has set forth another important point of the praxeo- logical method: that the paths in which the economist works out the implications of the axioms and the elaborated system whlch results will be decided by his own interests and by the kind of historical facts he is examining. Thus, it is theoretically possible to deduce the theory of money even in an economy of primitive barter, where no money exists; but it is doubtful whether a primitive praxeologist would have bothered to do so. Interestingly enough, Say at that early date saw the rise of the statistical and mathematical methods, and rebutted them from what can be described as a praxeological point of view. The difference between political economy and statistics is precisely the difference between political economy (or economic theory) and history. The former is based with certainty on universally observed and acknowledged general principles; therefore, \"a per- fect knowledge of the principles of political economy may be ob- tained, inasmuch as all the general facts which compose this science may be discovered.\" Upon these \"undeniable general facts,\" \"rigorous deductions\" are built, and to that extent political economy '~rests upon an immovable foundation.\" Sta- tistics, on the other hand, only records the ever changing pattern of particular facts, statistics 41 1ike history, being a recital of facts, more or less uncertain and necessarily incomplete.\" Furthermore, Say anticipated the praxeologist's view of historical and statistical data as themselves complex facts needing to be explained. \"The study of statistics may gratify curiosity, but it can never be pro~ 9 Jean-Baptiste Say, A Treatise on Political Economy, trans.

For political economy is concerned with men's values, and these values being \"subject to the influence of the faculties, the wants and the desires of mankind , they are not susceptible of any rigorous appreciation, and cannot therefore furnish any data for absolute calculations. In political science, all that is essential is a knowledge of the connexion between causes and their conse- quences. 11 Delving deeper into the then only embryonic use of the mathematical method in economics, Say points out that the laws of economics are strictly qualitative: \"We may, for example, know that for any given year the price of wine will infallibly depend upon the quantity to be sold, compared with the extent of the demand . 11 But \"if we are desirous of submitting these two data to mathematical calculation,\" then it becomes impossible to arrive at precise quantitative forecasts of the innumerable, ever changing forces at work: the climate, the quantity of the harvest, the quality of the product, the stock of wine held over from the previous vintage, the amount of capital , the possibilities of export, the supply of substitute beverages, and the changeable tastes and values of the consumers . 11 Say offers a highly perceptive insight into the nature and probable consequences of the application of mathematics to eco- nomics.

Cairnes, after agreeing with Mill that there can be no controlled experiments in the social sciences, adds that the latter have, however, a crucial advantage over the physical sciences. For, in the latter, monkind hove no direct knowledge of ultimote physico/ principles. The law of gravitation and the laws of motion are among the best established and most certain of such principles; but what is the evidence on which they rest? We do not lind them in our con- sciousness, by reflecting on what passes in our minds; nor can they be made apparent to our sense ... the proof of all such laws ultimately resolving itself into this, that, assuming them to exist, they account for the phenomena. In contrast, however, The economist starts with a knowledge of ultimate causes. He is already, at the outset of his enterprise, in the position which the physicist only attains after ages of laborious research . If any one doubt this, he has only to consider what the ultimate principles governing economic phenomena are . . . : certain mental feelings and certain animal propensities in human beings; [and] the: physi· cal conditions under which production takes place: .... For the discovery of such premises no elaborate process of induction is needed ... for this reason, that we have, or may have if we choose to turn our attention to the subject, direct knowledge of these causes in our consciousness of what passes in our own minds, and in the information which our senses convey ... to us of external facts . Every one who embarks in any industrial pursuit is con- scious of the motives which actuate him in doing so.

The emphasis of Cairnes and other classical economists on wealth as the soal of economic action has been modified by later praxeotoaical economists to include all manner of psycholoaical satisfactions, of which those stemming from material wealth are only a subset. A discussion similar to that of Cairnes can be found in F. A.

Cairnes demonstrates that deduced economic laws are \"tend- ency,\" or \"if-then,\" laws, and, moreover, that they are neces- sarily qualitative, and cannot admit of mathematical or quantita- tive expression. Thus, he too makes the point that it is impossible to determine precisely how much the price of wheat will rise in response lo a drop in supply; for one thing, \"it is evident that the disposition of people to sacrifice one kind of gratification to an- other-to sacrifice vanity to comfort, or decency 10 hunger-is not susceptible of precise measurement. ... \"\" In the preface to his second edition, two decades later in 1875, Cairnes reiterated his opposition to the growing application of the mathematical method to economics, which, in contrast to its use in the physical sciences, cannot produce new truths; \"and unless it can be shown either that mental feelings admit of being expressed in precise quantitative forms, or, on the other hand, that economic phenomena do not depend upon mental feelings, I am unable to see how this conclusion can be avoided.\" 11 Cairnes's older contemporary, Nassau Senior, was the most important praxeologist of that era. Before Senior, classical econ- omists such as John Stuart Mill had placed the fundamental premises of economics on the shaky ground of being hypotheses; the major hypothesis was that all men act to obtain the maximum of material wealth. Since this is clearly not always true, Mill had to concede that economics was only a hypothetical and approxi- mate science. Senior broadened the fundamental premise to in- clude immaterial wealth or satisfaction, a complete, apodictic, and universally true principle based on insight into the goal-seeking nature of human action. In stating that every man desires to obtain additional wealth with as liule sacrifice as possible, we must not be supposed to mean that everybody ... wishes for an indefinite quantity of everything . . . .

A few followers or sympatheti c observers, however, have car- ried on investigations into the methodology of the early Austrian School. Leland B. Yeager notes what we now see as the typically praxeological view of the unique advantage of economic theory over the physical sciences : \"While the basic elements of theoreti- cal interpretation in the natural sciences, such, he [Menger) says, as forces and atoms, cannot be observed directly, the elements of explanation in economics-human individuals and their strivings -are of a direct empirical nature., Furthermore, \"The facts that economists induce from the behavior of themselves and other people serve as axioms from which a useful body of economic theory can be logically deduced , much as in geometry an impres - sive body of theorems can be deduced from a few axioms.\" In short, \"Menger conceived of economic theory as a body of de- ductions from basic principles having a strong empirical founda - tion., Referring to the dominant positivist economists of our own day, Yeager adds perceptively, Not sharing . . . Menger's understanding of how empirical con - cent gets into so-called \"armchair theory,\" many economists of our own day apparently regard theoretical and empirical work as two distinct lields . Manipulation of arbitrarily-assumed functional relationships is justified in the minds of such economists by the idea that empirical testing of theories against the real world comes arterward. H Other writers have discovered links between the Austrian method and various strands of the philosophia perennis. Thus, Emil Kauder finds a close relationship between this method and Aristotelian philosophy, which was still influential in Austria at the end of the nineteen th century . Kauder points out tha t all the Austrians were \"social ontologists,\" and that as such they be- nLetand B.

Kauder also points out that for Menger and the Austrians , economic theory deals with types and typical relations, which provide knowledge that transcends the immediate, concrete case and is valid for all times and places. Concrete historical cases are thus the Aristo- telian \"matter\" which contains potentialities, while the laws and types are the Aristotelian \"forms\" which actualize the poten- tial. For the Austrians, and especially for Bohm-Bawerk, further- more, causality and teleology were identical. In contrast to the functional-mutual determination approach of Walras and of con- temporary economists, the Austrians traced the causes of economic phenomena back to the wants and choices of consumers. Wieser especially stressed the grounding of economic theory on the inner experience of the mind. B Furthermore, Ludwig M. Lachmann, in contrasting the Austrian and Lausanne Schools , shows that the Austrians were endeavoring to construct a \"verstehende social science,\" the same ideal that Max Weber was later to uphold. Lachmann points out that the older Ricardian economists adopted the \"objective\" method of the natural sciences insofar as their major focus was upon the quantitative problem of income distribution. In their analysis, factors of production (land, labor, and capital goods) react mechanically to external economic changes. But, in con- trast, \"Austrian Theory is 'subjective' also in the sense that indi- viduals ... perform acts and lend the imprint of their individual- ity to the events on the market.\" As for the contrast between Austria and Lausanne, it is the contrast between those [Lausanne) who coniine them· selves to determining the appropriate magnitudes of the elements of a system (the conditions of equilibrium} and those [the Aus- nEmil Kauder, \"Intellectual and Political Roots of the Older Austrian School,\"' Z~irschri/t jiir Ntztionalokonomie 17, no. 4 ( 19S8):4li-42S. 53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Individualism and the Social Sciences trians) who try to ex plain events in terms of the mental acts of the individuals who fashion them.

Croce, from his own highly deve loped praxeo - logical position, opened the debate by chiding Pareto for having written that economic theory was a species of mechanics . Vigor· ously rejecting this view, Croce points out that a fact in mechanics is a mere fact, which requires no positive or negative comment ; whereas words of approval or disapproval can appropriately be applied to an economic fact . The reason is that the true data of economics are not \"physical things and objects, but actions.

In his lengthy reply, Pareto reiterates the similarity between economics and mechanics, and, like the positivists of today, de· fends unrealistic mechanistic assumptions as simple abstractions from reality, in the supposed manner of the natural -sciences. Professing, in a typical positivist gambit, not to \"understand\" the concept of value, Pareto writes : \"I see ... that you employ the term value • ... I no longer use it as I do not know what it would convey to other people . .. . \" The concept of value is vague and complex and not subject to measurement; therefore, \"the equations of pure economics establish relations between quanti· ties of things, hence objective relations, and not relations between more or Jess precise concepts of our minds.\"\" Criticizing Croce's evident concentration on the essences of economic action, as exemplified in his insistence that \"one ought to study not the things which are the result of actions but the actions themselves,\" Pareto complains that this method is an ancient scientific fallacy. \"The ancients conjured up cosmogonies instead of studying astronomy, wondered about the principles of the elements water and fire . . . , instead of studying chemistry. Ancient science wanted to proceed from the origin to the facts. Modern science starts from the facts and proceeds towards the origin at an ex· tremely slow pace.\" Typically, Pareto sets forth the objectivist, positivist position by arguing from the analogy of the method of the natural sciences, thus completely begging the question of whether the methodologies of the natural and the social sciences should or should not be similar . Thus he concludes that \"science proceeds by replacing the relationships between human concepts (which relationships are the first to occur to us) by relationships between things. \" 17 Croce replies by criticizing Pareto's restriction of economics to measurable quantities as arbitrary; for what of those economic situations where the objects of action or exchange are not measur· able?

He goes on to reiterate various examples from physical science to demonstrate the proper methodology for all disciplines.

This primordial principle of \"methodological individualism ,\" central to Max Weber's social thought, must underlie praxeology as well as the other sciences of human action. It implies that such collective concepts as groups, nations, and states do not actually exist or act; they are only meta- phorical constructs for describing the similar or concerted actions of individuals . There are, in short, no \"governments\" as such; there are only individuals acting in concert in a \"governmental\" manner .

Hayek has demonstrated that the fallacy of treating collective constructs as directly perceived \"social wholes\" (\"capitalism,\" \"the nation,\" \"the class\") about which laws can be discovered stems from the objectivist-behaviorist insistence on treating men from the outside, as if they were stones, rather than attempting to understand their subjectively determined actions. It fthe objectivist view] treats social phenomena not as something of which the human mind is a part and the principles of whose organization we can construct from the familiar parts, but as if they were objects directly perceived by us as wholes .... There is the rather vague idea that since \"social phenomena\" arc to be the object of study, the obvious procedure is to start from the direct observation of these \"social phenomena,\" where the existence in popular usage of such terms as \"society\" or \"econ· omy\" is naively taken as evidence that there must be definite \"objects\" corresponding to them.n Hayek adds that emphasis on the meaning of the individual act brings out that what of social complexes is directly known to us are only the parts and that the whole is never directly perceived but always reconstructed by an effort of our imagination.\"u Alfred Schutz, the outstanding developer of the phenomeno- logical method in the social sciences, has reminded us of the importance of going back \"to the 'forgotten man' of the social sciences, to the actor in the social world whose doing and feeling lies at the bottom of the whole system.

Green has recently demonstrated how the use of invalid collective concepts has damaged the discipline of sociol- ogy. He notes the increasing use of \"society\" as an entity which thinks , feels, and acts, and, in recent years, has functioned as the perpetrator of all social ills. \"Society,\" for example, and not the criminal, is often held to be responsible for all crime. In many quarters \"society\" is considered almost demonic, a \"reified villain\" which \"may be attacked at will, blamed at random, de- rided and mocked with self-righteous fury, [and] may even be overturned by fiat or utopian yearning-and somehow, in some way, buses will still run on time.\" Green adds that \"if on the other hand, society is viewed as people whose insecure social relationships are preserved only by the fealty paid their common store of moral rules, then the area of free choice available in which with impunity to demand, undermine, and wreck, is sharply restricted.\" Moreover, if we realize that \"society\" does not itself exist, but is made up only of individual people, then to say that \"society is responsible for crime, and criminals are not responsible for crime, is to say that only those members of society who do not commit crime can be held responsible for crime .

Thus, during the era of t he gold standard there was occasionally great alarm that \"England\" or \"France\" was in mortal danger because \" it\" was losing gold. What actually happened was that Englishmen and Frenchmen were voluntarily shipping gold over - seas and thus threatening the people who ran the banks of those countries with the necessity of meeting obligations to pay in gold which they could not possibly fulfill. But the use of the collective metaphor converted a grave problem of banking into a vague national crisis for which every citizen was somehow responsible. Similarly, during the 1930s and 1940s many economists pro - claimed tha t in contrast to debts owed overseas, the size of the domestic public debt was unimportant because \"we only owe it to ourselves . \" The implication was that the collec tive national person owed \"himself\" money from one pocket to another. This explanation obscured the fact that it makes a substantial diffe r- ence for every person whether he is a member of the \"we\" or the \"ourselves.\" Sometimes the collective concept is treated unabashedly as a biological organism . Thus, the popular concep t of economi c growth implies that every economy is somehow des tined, in the manner of a living organism, to .. grow\" in some predetermined manner. The use of such analogical terms is an attempt to over- look or even negate individual will and consciousness in social and economic affairs.

However, the statements of these sciences can claim no universal validity, for they deal either with the economic sentiments of particular historical individuals or with types of economic activity for which the economic acts in question are evidence ....
