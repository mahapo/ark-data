It attracted me at atime when America rejected as profoundly as it did under Lincoln and the RadicalRepublicans and even under FDR, the libertarian first principles of the AmericanRevolution.To pursue this interest, I volunteered to take a course in the Graduate School,a procedure permitted for a few undergraduates at the time. The course was anadvanced look at Progressive intellectual thought taught by Woodrow Wilson’sbiographer and hagiographer, Professor Arthur S. Link. The readings were allpro-Progressive as were all the other students in the class. We studiedProfessor Link’s works and the claptrap by his colleague William E.Leuchtenberg.In my search for a rational understanding of the Era—and for ammunition to usein the classroom where I was regularly beaten up—I asked Professor Link if anyacademic had made the argument effectively that the Progressives werepower-hungry charlatans in the guise of noble businessmen, selfless politicians,and honest academics.He told me of a young fellow named Rothbard, of whose work he had only heard,but had not read. This advice sent me to Man, Economy, and State, which Idevoured; and my ideological odyssey was off to the races.Like many of Rothbard’s student admirers, I also devoured For a New Liberty, allfour volumes of Conceived in Liberty, and The Mystery of Banking. As any studentof human freedom in general or of the Austrian school specifically, knows, thesemust-reads are all a joy to read. And we also know that in those works andothers, Rothbard established himself as the great interpreter of Ludwig vonMises.While he was writing those books and lecturing nationally and producing manyground-breaking articles and essays on human freedom, he began to write discretechapters of a book he would not live to publish on the Progressive Era.One of his great young interpreters, Florida Southern College professor andMises Fellow Patrick Newman, has picked up where our hero left off. ProfessorNewman is a brilliant interpreter of Rothbard. His assemblage of theseheretofore unpublished chapters, and the vast notes he has added to them haveproduced a masterpiece that might actually have made Murray Rothbard blush.Readers of The Progressive Era will carry away an overwhelming impression thathistory is “a comprehensive resurrection of the past.” Rothbard was neversatisfied with the presentation of a general thesis or the sketch of ahistorical period, which is why readers will find detailed accounts of anenormous number of people. Only a historian of Rothbard’s immense intellectualenergy and knowledge could have written what would become The Progressive Era.Rothbard did not amass details merely to give readers a sense of the ProgressiveEra, from the 1880s to the 1920s. Rather, he uses these details to support arevolutionary new interpretation. Many people view the Progressives as reformerswho fought against corruption and modernized our laws and institutions. Rothbardproves to the hilt that this common opinion is false.The Progressives aimed to displace a 19th-century America that respectedindividual rights based on natural law. They claimed that natural law and a freeeconomy were outmoded and unscientific ideas; and argued that through applyingscience to politics, they could replace a corrupt and stagnant old order with aState-ordered more prosperous and egalitarian one.Rothbard dissents:> Briefly, the thesis is that the rapid upsurge of statism in this period was> propelled by a coalition of two broad groups: (a) certain big business groups,> anxious to replace a roughly laissez-faire economy by a new form of> mercantilism, cartelized and controlled and subsidized by a strong government> under their influence and control; and (b) newly burgeoning groups of> intellectuals, technocrats, and professionals: economists, writers, engineers,> planners, physicians, etc., anxious for power and lucrative employment at the> hands of the State. Since America had been born in an antimonopoly tradition,> it became important to put over the new system of cartelization as a> “progressive” curbing of big business by a humanitarian government;> intellectuals were relied on for this selling job. These two groups were> inspired by Bismarck’s creation of a monopolized welfare-warfare state in> Prussia and Germany.Rothbard constantly overturns accepted ideas as he argues for hisinterpretation. Most of us have heard of the furor early in the 20th centuryover conditions in the Chicago meat packing industry, set off by UptonSinclair’s novel The Jungle. Few people are aware, however, that Sinclair’ssensationalism was fiction, in direct contradiction to what contemporaryinspections of the meat packing plants revealed.Rothbard goes much further. He shows how, beginning in the 1880s, the large meatpacking plants lobbied for greater regulation themselves.> Unfortunately for the myth, [about The Jungle’s influence] the drive for> federal meat inspection actually began more than two decades earlier, and was> launched mainly by the big meat packers themselves. The spur was the urge to> penetrate the European market for meat, something which the large meat packers> thought could be done if the government would certify the quality of meat, and> thereby make American meat more highly rated abroad. Not coincidentally, as in> all Colbertist mercantilist legislation over the centuries, a> governmentally-coerced upgrading of quality would serve to cartelize: to lower> production, restrict competition, and raise prices to the consumers.Rothbard sees in postmillennial pietism a key to the entire Progressive Era. Thepostmillennials preached that Jesus would inaugurate His kingdom only after theworld had been reformed, and they accordingly saw a religious mandate toinstitute the social reforms they favored.Their influence was pervasive. For example, Rothbard draws an unexpectedconnection between their ideas and eugenics:> One way of correcting the increasingly pro-Catholic demographics ... often> promoted in the name of “science,” was eugenics, an increasingly popular> doctrine of the progressive movement. Broadly, eugenics may be defined as> encouraging the breeding of the “fit” and discouraging the breeding of the> “unfit,” the criteria of “fitness” often coinciding with the cleavage between> native, white Protestants and the foreign born or Catholics—or the white-black> cleavage. In extreme cases, the unfit were to be coercively sterilized.Theodore Roosevelt was the quintessential Progressive, and Rothbard shows inconvincing fashion how his analytic framework helps explain that bizarre andflamboyant figure. Roosevelt was allied with the banking interests of the Houseof Morgan. His “trust busting” activities were very selective. Only the trustsopposed to Morgan control were in Roosevelt’s crosshairs. He supported “good”trusts, i.e., ones allied with the Morgan interests. Besides his Morganalliance, Roosevelt was dominated by a bellicosity of maniacal proportions. “Allhis life Theodore Roosevelt had thirsted for war—any war—and military glory.”War and the Progressives were natural allies. War brought centralized control ofthe economy, and this allowed the Progressives to put their plans into effect.Rothbard writes:> The wartime collectivism also held forth a model to the nation’s liberal> intellectuals; for here was seemingly a system that replaced laissez-faire not> by the rigors and class hatreds of proletarian Marxism, but by a new strong> State, planning and organizing the economy in harmony with all leading> economic groups. It was, not coincidentally, to be a neomercantilism, a “mixed> economy,” heavily staffed by these selfsame liberal intellectuals.> > And finally, both big business and the liberals saw in the wartime model a way> to organize and integrate the often unruly labor force as a junior partner in> the corporatist system—a force to be disciplined by their own “responsible”> leadership of the labor unions.I have addressed only a few of the themes analyzed in this vast book. Readershave many insights in store for them, including the origin of the FederalReserve System, Herbert Hoover’s activities as a Progressive, and the role ofthe Rockefellers in promoting Social Security. Nor does Rothbard shy away fromthe constitutional implications in all this, planted by Roosevelt and nurturedby his personal enemy but ideological comrade Woodrow Wilson. Rothbard notesthat, the War Between the States aside, the Madisonian model—the federalgovernment may only lawfully do what the Constitution directly permits—prevailedin government from 1789 to the 1880s. After the Progressive Era, the Wilsonianmodel—the federal government may do whatever there is a political will to doexcept that which the Constitution expressly prohibits—continues to prevail upto the present day.We owe the appearance of The Progressive Era to the masterful detective work andpatient labor of the good and youthful Professor Newman. In his “Introduction,”he tells the dramatic tale of how Rothbard’s book was discovered and assembled;and he has planted many teasers for the Rothbardian gems to come.Rothbard’s posthumous masterpiece is the definitive book on the Progressives.Only Murray Rothbard, with his unique scholarship, penetrating intelligence,prodigious work ethic, infectious love of life, and indefatigable devotion toliberty, could have written this book. It will soon be the must read study ofthis dreadful time in our past.Andrew P. NapolitanoHampton Township, New JerseyAuthor of Theodore and Woodrow: How Two AmericanPresidents Destroyed Constitutional FreedomAugust 2017"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONBY PATRICK NEWMANMurray Rothbard was a scholar of enormous erudition with many diverse researchinterests. He wrote about economic theory, economic history, history of economicthought, pure history, philosophy, political science, and popular culture.Indeed, David Gordon writes, “A person examining the books and articles ofMurray Rothbard without prior acquaintance with their author could not helpwondering whether five or six prolific scholars shared the name ‘MurrayRothbard’.”[1] [part0006.html#fn1] Among all of these disciplines, one area ofresearch to which Rothbard devoted a significant portion of his academic careerand utilized many of the above fields was late 19th and early 20th centuryUnited States history, particularly the period that is known as the ProgressiveEra (approximately from the late 1890s to the early 1920s).The Progressive Era was one of the most, if not the most, significant periods inU.S. history. The country was transformed from a relatively laissez-faireeconomy with a minimal government into a heavily regulated economy governed byan interventionist state. Correspondingly, the ideology of public intellectuals,business, the citizenry, and political parties drastically changed and becamemore interventionist. For most historians, this was the period when the countrywas growing up, when it realized that minimal government was not suited for amodern industrial economy, because it produced numerous social ills such asfrequent business cycles, unemployment, monopolies, crippling deflation, poorquality products, and enormous economic inequality. For Rothbard, on the otherhand, it was the turning point, the time when America abandoned itslaissez-faire strengths for the welfare-warfare state, and thereby plungedheadfirst into all of its destructive consequences in the 20th century.It is well known that Rothbard was deeply interested in the Progressive Era andthroughout his life wrote numerous papers on it. Less well known, if it is knownat all, is that Rothbard had also partially written a full blown book on theperiod, starting with the railroad interventions of the 1860s to the NationalCivic Federation of the early 1900s. The book was written while Rothbard washeavily involved with the Cato Institute during the 1970s. While Rothbard neverformally completed the book, he informally finished it by writing the remainingchapters as various essays which were published in the 1980s and 1990s. JustinRaimondo, Rothbard’s only biographer, commented on the project in 2000:> Rothbard’s writings on the Progressive Era, which have never been put together> in a single volume, are a rich vein of analysis that contemporary scholars,> libertarian or whatever, would do well to mine. In a fascinating narrative> that unfolds like the plot of a novel, Rothbard documents his thesis with the> fascinating stories of the men, and especially the women, who led the> Progressive movement: ministers, social workers, intellectuals, and other> professional do-gooders, whose zeal to remake America in the image of an> (often secularized) God was rooted in the theological vision in which humanity> would be the agency that would establish the Kingdom of God on earth.[2]> [part0006.html#fn2]It is the task of this volume, at long last, to combine the unfinished book andother essays and publish the complete Rothbardian history of the ProgressiveEra.In 1962, at the age of 36, the young Murray Rothbard had already producedmultiple classics in the Austrian and libertarian tradition. Some of these wereof smaller scope in the form of a paper or monograph. Others were much largerand more ambitious, such as his comprehensive treatise on economics. The firsttwo volumes were published in 1962 under the title Man, Economy, and State, thelast volume on government intervention deemed too controversial, Power andMarket, in 1970. Another was America’s Great Depression, which came out a yearlater, an economic history that gave the authoritative Austrian interpretationof the United States’ Roaring Twenties and Great Depression. In addition to bothof these, he also wrote his dissertation, The Panic of 1819, under JosephDorfman, which he defended in 1956 and published in 1962.[3][part0006.html#fn3][4] [part0006.html#fn4] If he had ended his career then,Rothbard would have already cemented his status as one of the foremost scholarsin Austrian economics and libertarianism.However, Rothbard did not end his career, and he was still eager to writeprodigiously, especially on completely different topics. In a letter to KennethS. Templeton, Jr., an associate of the Volker Fund which provided the researchgrant for Man, Economy, and State, he wrote:> I am also happy to have the opportunity to leave the realm of economic theory,> for, with the books published and especially with Man, Economy, and State, I> believe I have said whatever I have to say about economics, and am now eager> to move on. I have a constitutional aversion to repeating myself and milking> my previous stuff ad infinitum—which seems to be a way of life for so many> scholars.[5] [part0006.html#fn5]For the remainder of the 1960s, Rothbard would focus his energies on a number ofdifferent fields, including history, political philosophy, and popularlibertarianism. Like before, he would work on many projects of varying sizes atthe same time. His next major work was a history of the United States. In late1962, through the auspices of Templeton, he received a grant from the LillyEndowment that would last until 1966 to write a one volume text on Americanhistory from a libertarian perspective. He was to work with Leonard Liggio, ayoung historian Rothbard’s junior who had developed a close connection with himin the 1950s.Rothbard’s major projects frequently took on a life of their own. Man, Economy,and State was originally supposed to be a textbook translation of his mentorLudwig von Mises’s Human Action; instead, after careful deliberation, Rothbarddecided to transform it into a full blown treatise on economics.[6][part0006.html#fn6] The last work of his life, An Austrian Perspective on theHistory of Economic Thought, was originally supposed to be a small volume thatprovided the anti-Heilbroner alternative to economic thought from Adam Smithonward. It too became a massive two-volume work (the planned third volume wasunfortunately never written) that spanned from the ancient Greek philosophers toKarl Marx.[7] [part0006.html#fn7] And the current history project would not bepublished as a general overview of American history at all, but instead afive-volume work titled Conceived in Liberty which spanned from the founding ofthe American colonies to the United States Constitution.[8] [part0006.html#fn8]Commenting on the evolution of the project in an interview, which equallyapplies to his other work, Rothbard said “I don’t chart this stuff in advance. Idon’t like to work that way. I go step by step and it keeps getting longer.”[9][part0006.html#fn9]The major theme of Conceived in Liberty, which also applied to his otherhistorical work, was the idea of Liberty versus Power. Throughout history, therehas been an eternal battle between those who wield the coercive power of theState apparatus, and those who wish to resist it. Throughout most of humanhistory, to quote the famous words of Thomas Hobbes, life was “nasty, brutishand short.” Tyrants of all stripes, emperors, kings, feudal barons, andwarlords, subjugated the masses and ruled over them with an iron first. Thedominant economic system of this ancien régime was mercantilism, wheregovernment subsidies and other forms of protectionism were granted to favoredbusinesses and other special interests. Then suddenly, in Britain and theAmerican colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, this changed, and muchdifferent forms of government were created—ones that were more limited in scopeand allowed for greater liberty. The American colonies in particular cast offthe oppressive shackles of their royal governors, and then later the Britishgovernment completely in the American Revolution, in favor of a far more limitedgovernment and laissez-faire economic system that the people directlycontrolled. The fight was not over however, as those fighting for liberty andlimited government continually clashed with those wishing to expand the size ofgovernment in the 19th century.How did this occur? How were the ideas of Liberty versus Power disseminated tothe broad populace? Why, for so long, did the public stand the depredations oftheir rulers in the ancien régime? Why did they later revolt against thisdispensation and fight for liberty? And fast forwarding to the Progressive Era,why did the pendulum shift back to statism and acceptance of increased staterule?The answers to all of these questions involve the role of ideology andintellectuals filtering these messages down to the public. Throughout history,there have been two types of intellectuals. The first are the courtintellectuals, originally the priests and the clergymen. Their job was toconvince the public of the righteousness and legitimacy of the ruler throughreligious means (such as “The King is Divine”) and to truckle to his predations.In return for these necessary public relations, the court intellectuals were toreceive their fair share of the pelf taken from the public. This relationshipwas the famous Alliance of Throne and Altar that existed throughout most ofhistory in various forms. On the other hand, there are the radical andrevolutionary intellectuals who were out to spread the message of liberty andfight against the coercive order. They were not in it for power or prestige butinstead liberty and justice.The principal transmission mechanism during the American Revolution was thenatural rights theory of John Locke. While Locke’s work provided the ultimatetheoretical edifice, it was very abstract, and the message was insteaddistributed to the public through the much more popular and easier readings ofCato’s Letters, written by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon.[10][part0006.html#fn10] Here were the works that instilled in the public a radicallibertarian ideology that emanated in various ways in subsequent years. Theimportance of intellectuals in filtering ideas to the public, statist orlibertarian, would be a major theme of Rothbard’s historical work.Rothbard never did write a complete history of the United States, as originallyintended, but he did subsequently concentrate on certain periods, particularlythe late 19th and early 20th centuries, which included everything from theProgressive Era to World War I to the Great Depression.[11] [part0006.html#fn11]The Progressive Era was the main catalyst behind later events, for it providedthe necessary framework that created the modern welfare-warfare state andincreases in government power. In 1965, while heavily researching Americanhistory and writing Conceived in Liberty, in his seminal article “Left andRight: Prospects for Liberty” Rothbard had already laid out his generalframework for understanding this transformation, using the historical work ofGabriel Kolko:> In The Triumph of Conservatism, Kolko traces the origins of political> capitalism in the “reforms” of the Progressive Era. ... Despite the wave of> mergers and trusts formed around the turn of the century, Kolko reveals, the> forces of competition on the free market rapidly vitiated and dissolved these> attempts at stabilizing and perpetuating the economic power of big business> interests. It was precisely in reaction to their impending defeat at the hands> of the competitive storms of the market that big business turned, increasingly> after the 1900s, to the federal government for aid and protection. In short,> the intervention by the federal government was designed, not to curb big> business monopoly for the sake of the public weal, but to create monopolies> that big business (as well as trade associations of smaller business) had not> been able to establish amidst the competitive gales of the free market ...> > Thus, Kolko shows that, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt’s New Nationalism> and culminating in Wilson’s New Freedom, in industry after industry, for> example, insurance, banking, meat, exports and business generally, regulations> that present-day rightists think of as “socialistic” were not only uniformly> hailed, but conceived and brought about by big businessmen. This was a> conscious effort to fasten upon the economy a cement of subsidy,> stabilization, and monopoly privilege.[12] [part0006.html#fn12]Here Rothbard explains the central idea that big business, far from beinglaissez-faire ideologues, was interested in developing government regulations toactively hamper their competitors and help it cartelize in order to restrictsupply and raise prices. He would extend this theme in two later essays he wroteshortly thereafter on the Progressive Era, “War Collectivism in World War I” and“Herbert Hoover and the Myth of Laissez-Faire.”[13] [part0006.html#fn13]Kolko, along with the Chicago school economist George Stigler, espoused whatlater came to be labelled the “capture” theory of regulation. This theory statesthat regulation purportedly designed to curb business abuses is actually often“captured” by various businesses in order to enhance their own profits andweaken their competitors. In addition, in many cases the regulation is evenpromoted by the businesses themselves for this specific purpose. This is opposedto the “public interest” theory, which argues that regulation is designed for,and ultimately benefits, the general public, and the “bureaucratic” theory,which argues that regulations are enacted to empower various bureaucrats andgovernment agencies. As will be seen below, Rothbard combined both the captureand bureaucratic theories in his historical narrative of the ProgressiveEra.[14] [part0006.html#fn14] His narrative was intimately linked with hisgeneral historical method, which sought to understand the various motivations ofspecial interests who lobby for government legislation.While Rothbard was Mises’s foremost student in wielding the praxeological methodto deduce a body of abstract economic theorems, he was also his foremost studentin applying them to history and utilizing his thymological method, bestdescribed in Theory and History.[15] [part0006.html#fn15] In contrast topraxeology, the science of human action, thymology is the science ofunderstanding why humans act a certain way, or “psychologizing” their behavior(psychology understood in the common-sense definition). This historical methodstrives to answer the eternal question “Cui bono?” or, “Who Benefits?” from anaction, particularly a change in government institutions. More specifically, thethymological method looks at both pecuniary and nonpecuniary (such as religious)motivations, and seeks to answer the question “Who thinks they stand tobenefit?” The latter question emphasizes that not all results of a governmentintervention are intended, and that not all special interest groups who lobbyfor a regulation actually do benefit ex post. To answer the latter question, oneneeds to engage in a detailed historical understanding of the various actorsinvolved and not just a statistical test, which is the usual approach of aneconomist.Rothbard’s use of the thymological method in his historical analysis is alsoclosely related to his consistent application of the sociological law called“The Iron Law of Oligarchy.” The law states that governments, politicians, andlegislation are not controlled by democratic majorities or public opinion, butinstead by a small entrenched group of individuals. This group contains a mix ofbig businesses, politicians, and bureaucrats who wield the state apparatus fortheir own benefit at the expense of the rest of society. Court intellectualssupply the necessary public relations in various ways, such as by arguing thatthe government is not controlled by a small elite or that certain governmentactions are necessary, in return for power and prestige. There is a closerelationship between this law and the method in political science called “PowerElite analysis.” Governments are controlled by well-established financial andpolitical elites who pull the levers “behind the scenes,” and governmentofficials and bureaucrats often have many important links, including familialties, with the business community that provide powerful motivations forexplaining why they acted a certain way while in office. These approaches andRothbard’s consistent application of them have often been criticized as crank“conspiracy theories,” but it is important to note that proper use of them isonly an extension of Mises’s thymological method, which seeks to understandhuman action and explain its motivations. Government officials do not fall fromthe sky without any prior connections to the political and business world, andthey are just as self-interested as those in the private sector. There is astrong similarity between what is called “Public Choice analysis” and thethymological approach, although the two are not completely identical. Thethymological method places more emphasis on engaging in pure historical work inunderstanding the motivations of acting individuals, as well as the fact thatindividuals often act in a certain way and expect to benefit but do not actuallydo so. In addition, Rothbard’s particular application also places much moreemphasis on the oligarchical and coercive aspects of State rule.[16][part0006.html#fn16]As the late 1960s and early 1970s passed, Rothbard would not turn away fromutilizing the thymological method in his scholarly work. On the contrary, hewould continue to elaborate on the method in important popular articles,updating Conceived in Liberty for publication and publishing other historicalpapers, such as “The New Deal and the International Monetary System.”[17][part0006.html#fn17] More importantly for our purposes here, Rothbard also beganwriting his book on the Progressive Era while affiliated with the CatoInstitute.With this work Rothbard planned to continue his project on American history,only now fast forwarding from the change in ideology and government from statismto liberty to the change from liberty to statism. He would chronicle how thebattle of Liberty versus Power was lost around the turn of the 20th century. Hewas not only going to utilize the works of Kolko, but also the works of othernotable revisionist historians who wrote on the period in recent years, such asJames Weinstein, Paul Kleppner, Richard Jensen, and James Gilbert. Rothbardsuccinctly described his thesis in a book proposal:> The purpose of this projected book is to synthesize the remarkable quantity> and quality of new and fresh work on the Progressive Era (roughly the late> 1890s to the early 1920s) that has been done in the past twenty years. In> particular, the object is to trace the causes, the nature, and the> consequences of the dramatic shift of the U.S. polity from a relatively> laissez-faire system to the outlines of the statist era that we are familiar> with today.> > The older paradigm of historians held the burst of statism in the Progressive> Era to be the response of a coalition of workers, farmers, and altruistic> intellectuals to the rising tide of big business monopoly, with the coalition> bringing in big government to curb and check that monopoly.> > Research in the past two decades has overthrown that paradigm in almost every> detail.The burst in statism would be explained by an alliance between big business, bigunions, big government, and big intellectuals who were able to take control dueto a seismic change in the political system following the election of 1896:> [T]he essence of Progressivism was that certain elements of big business,> having sought monopoly through cartels and mergers on the free market without> success, turned to government—federal, state, and local—to achieve that> monopoly through government-sponsored and enforced cartelization ...> > Allied to these big business elements in imposing Progressivism were what> Gilbert calls “collectivist intellectuals,” whose goals no longer seem that> altruistic. Rather, they seem like the first great wave of the “New Class” of> modern intellectuals out for a share of power and for the fruits of similar> governmental cartelization ...> > In the last decade, the “new political history” stressing ethno-religious> determinants of mass political attitudes, voting, and political parties ...> has added another important dimension to this story ... Kleppner explains that> the triumph of the Bryan forces in the Democratic Party in 1896 marked the end> of the Democrats as a laissez-faire party, and the subsequent lack of real> electoral choice left a power vacuum for Progressive technocrats,> intellectuals, and businessmen to fill.[18] [part0006.html#fn18]The original outline of the book was “roughly as follows,” and appears to havebeen the following nine chapters:Chapter 1: IntroductionChapter 2: The Failure of Attempts at MonopolyChapter 3: Government as CartelistChapter 4: Centralization of the CitiesChapter 5: Science and Morality: the Intellectual as CorporatistChapter 6: The New American EmpireChapter 7: World War I: the Culmination of the Corporatist SystemChapter 8: The 1920’s Corporatism After the WarChapter 9: Epilogue: to the Present[19] [part0006.html#fn19]Chapter 2 would explain the ways in which business attempts at cartelization,mergers, or monopolies failed, whether it was railroads or major industrialfirms such as U.S. Steel. Chapter 3 would document the resultant state andfederal attempts at cartelization pushed by big businesses, such as theInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),meatpacking legislation, the Federal Reserve System (FRS), and the importance ofthe National Civic Federation in spurring the new interventions. Chapter 4 woulddescribe local Progressive politics and the drive by reformers to weaken theethnic immigrants and push for prohibition and public schools. Chapter 5 wouldexplain the evolution of intellectuals into acting as apologists for the new biggovernment, and Chapter 6 would be on the pre-World War I changes in Americanforeign policy, including interventions in Asia, South America, and the Spanish-American War. Chapter 7 would explain the Wilson administration’s push forintervening in the European war, the devolution of the Democratic Party awayfrom its laissez-faire heritage, and how the war represented the culmination ofthe Progressive movement. Chapter 8 would document the Progressivism of HerbertHoover and the 1920s monetary interventions of Benjamin Strong, and Chapter 9would briefly extend the analysis up into the present.[20] [part0006.html#fn20]When writing the manuscript, Rothbard more or less followed this outline, withone major exception. Instead of postponing the transformation of the DemocraticParty to the World War I Chapter 7 (in order to explain the Wilsonadministration’s drive toward war), Rothbard moved it up to right after thefailure of the merger movement and monopolies (listed above as Chapter 2).Rothbard decided to move up explaining the Democratic and Republican partiesduring the third party system up until the election of 1896, when both partiesbecame center-statist and there was no longer a clear laissez-faire party inAmerican politics.Rothbard appears to have worked on the manuscript from 1978 to 1981. Like manyof his projects, the book took on a life of its own and grew much bigger thanthe original plan. By 1981, Rothbard wrote rough drafts of nine chapters, but hewas only still on what was planned to be Chapter 3 of the original proposal!Chapter 2 on monopolies grew into three chapters, with two whole chaptersdevoted to the railroad question, which Rothbard initially planned to only visit“briefly.” Explaining the third party system and the election of 1896 took threeentire chapters, and Rothbard devoted two entire chapters to the Progressivecartelization during the Roosevelt administration, and a stand-alone chapter onthe National Civic Federation, and was still not done with what he wanted towrite about in the original chapter 3.By 1981, Rothbard was no longer working on the remaining chapters of the book.But by no means was Rothbard not finishing the book. Instead, he was writing theremaining chapters as papers that were published in the 1980s, early 1990s, orposthumously after his unexpected death in 1995. On the material planned to bein Chapter 4, such as the feminist movement and women’s suffrage, urban reform,prohibition, and other aspects of local Progressivism, Rothbard wrote “TheProgressive Era and the Family” and “Origins of the Welfare State in America.”In addition to the above topics and on the material in Chapters 5 and 7 onintellectuals and World War I, Rothbard wrote “World War I as Fulfillment: Powerand the Intellectuals.” On the progression of American foreign policy plannedfor Chapters 6, 7, and 9, Rothbard wrote “Wall Street, Banks, and AmericanForeign Policy.” Rothbard devoted the most space to the origins of the FederalReserve (part of Chapter 3) and on 1920s monetary interventions (part of Chapter8), such as the historical sections in The Mystery of Banking, “The FederalReserve as a Cartelization Device, The Early Years: 1913–1930,” the historicalsections in The Case Against the Fed, “The Gold Exchange Standard in theInterwar Years,” “The Origins of the Federal Reserve,” and “From Hoover toRoosevelt: The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elites.”[21][part0006.html#fn21] He was selected to be a reviewer in 1985 for Robert Higgs’sCrisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government, inwhich he wrote an in-depth review that showed he was still deeply immersed andinterested in the Progressive Era.[22] [part0006.html#fn22] Moreover, whileteaching at Brooklyn Polytechnic, Rothbard taught a class in 1986 on theProgressive Era, in which he lectured on segments of the book manuscript as wellas other Progressive Era essays he had written or was working on.[23][part0006.html#fn23]It could be said that, in the last decade or so of Rothbard’s life, aside fromworking on his all-encompassing history of economic thought, Progressivism wasthe next most significant area of research on his mind. That Rothbard wasinterested in Progressivism right up until his untimely death in 1995 can beseen when reading The Case Against the Fed, the last book published in hislifetime, since Rothbard devoted a significant portion of it to providing abrief overview of Progressivism and the history of the Federal Reserve. Nodoubt, if Rothbard lived to write his third volume on the history of economicthought, which planned to cover topics ranging from the 1871 Marginal Revolutionto the 1930s Keynesian Revolution and beyond, he would have written extensivelyabout the Progressivist intellectuals.Rothbard’s book manuscript and the essays contained in The Progressive Era,represent a lifetime of deep research in American history. Rothbard was deeplyimmersed in all areas of American history, especially the Progressive Era, andhe was able to collate a massive amount of research and facts and synthesizethem to create his own unique narrative of the era. The remainder of thisintroduction will provide a brief overview of the Rothbardian interpretation aswell as a general summary of the chapters and essays contained therein.Rothbard’s central thesis is that big businesses had previously tried tocartelize on the free market around the turn of the 20th century, but had failedto do so. Try as they might, the cartel agreements and mergers failed because ofthe internal pressure of collaborators cheating and the external pressure of newcompetitors entering the market to cut prices and break the cartels. Havingfailed in this endeavor, they turned to government regulations in order to helpthem cartelize by preventing various forms of price and product competition andpreventing new smaller competitors from successfully entering markets by raisingtheir costs. Big Business allied itself with Big Government, who wanted theregulations in order to increase its own power, and Big Unions, to help stiflethe radical opposition of labor. However, this was a resurrection of the ancienrégime in a different form, and it could not simply be imposed on the public whowas all too familiar with this system and instilled with relativelylaissez-faire principles. In order to sell it to the public they needed a newbreed of collectivist intellectuals, many of whom were thoroughly convinced ofthe ways of Bismarckian socialism after receiving their Ph.D.s in Germany in thepost-Civil War era. The Alliance of Throne and Altar was back with a vengeance,between the favored government interests and the intellectual apologists, onlythat this time the intellectuals were not convincing the public that the King’smandate was the word of God and his depredations were divine, but that BigGovernment was needed in order to improve the public welfare and cure the socialproblems brought on by unfettered capitalism. In return, the intellectuals wereto benefit by becoming professionalized and given lucrative jobs in planning andadministering the whole apparatus. The Alliance saw itself as a middle of theroad stabilizer between anarchic and outdated laissez-faire capitalism andconfiscatory and extremist socialism.This dramatic change at the beginning of the 20th century was not able to beinstituted on the existing political system, but occurred after a seismic changein the orientation of the political parties. This resulted from theethnoreligious political battles between the Democrats and the Republicans inthe 1880s and 1890s which led to the climactic election of 1896.During the third party system (1854–1896) of American politics, the great massof the public was ideological and learned their respective economic positionsfrom political activists who translated them into ethno-cultural and religiousterms. On the one hand, there was the Republican Party, “The Party of GreatMoral Ideas,” dominated by pietist “Yankee” natives. They were “postmillennial”in that they believed in order for Jesus to return to earth and usher in the endof history, they must first bring about a thousand year Kingdom of God. In orderto do so, they not only needed to save themselves, but also save others, even ifit required state force. Thus the pietists were hell-bent on stamping out allforms of sin, including instituting prohibition and weakening the “Roman Popery”of the Catholic schools, along with other measures such as immigrationrestriction and women’s suffrage (to boost the pietist vote). This paternalisticintervention on the local ethnoreligious level was translated to a paternalisticintervention on the larger economic realm, such as enacting various governmentsubsidies, tariffs, or greenback inflation. On the other hand, there was theDemocratic Party, “The Party of Personal Liberty,” dominated by liturgicalnatives and immigrants, such as Catholics and Lutherans. These religiousdenominations did not have the evangelical zeal to actively save others andstamp out sin, but only to follow the teachings and practices of theirrespective churches. As a result, they criticized all Republican localinterventions as paternalistic drives to meddle and control their lives,correspondingly saw their economic policies as allied, and consequently favoreda more laissez-faire agenda, including less government spending, low tariffs,and the gold standard. The laissez-faire Democrats were also called the BourbonDemocrats, who were generally centered in the Northeast and Midwest, and whoseancestors belonged to the laissez-faire wing of the Jacksonian Democrats. Thebattle of Liberty versus Power was being fought once again in American history.The Democrats were slowly but surely winning, and in the late 1880s and early1890s made a remarkable series of gains, shocking the Republican elite. In orderto counter this trend, Republican elites strategically decided to downplayethno-cultural issues and become more hard money in order to stop alienatingliturgicals at the expense of aggravating pietists. This also fortuitouslycoincided with the Panic of 1893, a severe economic depression that (unjustly)hurt the incumbent Bourbon Democrats at the polls. To make matters worse, at thesame time the Southern and Western Democratic pietist populists, who werebecoming increasingly “Yankee” and activist, were able to wrest control of theDemocratic Party machine while the Bourbon leaders were weakened due to thedepression. William Jennings Bryan, not Grover Cleveland, was now the standardbearer for the new Democratic Party. Liturgicals went to the Republicans indroves while pietists flocked to the Democrats. With this remarkable turnaround,in the election of 1896 the moderate statist Republican presidential nomineeWilliam McKinley resoundingly defeated the pietist inflationist Democraticpresidential nominee William Jennings Bryan and established Republican dominancefor the next several decades. This ended the third party system of Americanelectoral politics, when the parties were fiercely ideological and polarized,and brought about the fourth party system (1896–1932), when both parties becameless ideologically defined and more center-statist, with increasing controlgranted to bureaucrats from the resultant de-democratization. The weakening ofthe Bourbon forces reduced the Democrats to minority status, and ended anylaissez-faire majority party in America. This lacuna, and the increasingsimilarity and center statism between the two parties due to the recentmetamorphosis, created the power vacuum that allowed for the new quadripartitealliance to take hold of America.With this rejuvenation of the Alliance, embodied in the newly formed NationalCivic Federation, came a whole spate of “Progressive” measures, includingincreased railroad regulation, trustbusting, compulsory publicity laws,conservation laws, meatpacking legislation, the Pure Food and Drug Act,employers’ compensation laws, safety legislation, the minimum wage, the FederalReserve System, and the Federal Trade Commission. The once staunchly pietistProgressive intellectuals arguing on behalf of the entire system slowly butsurely became increasingly secularized and more committed to using statecoercion to ostensibly improve public welfare than to create the Kingdom of God.Moreover, academia in general and its disciplines, such as economics, began todenigrate theory and embrace statistics and empirical analysis in an attempt tovainly ape the natural sciences. The need for greater data collection andinductive reasoning went hand-in-hand with greater government planning andinterventionism.The transformation of the American government and subsequent interventions werenot isolated events unconnected to specific financial and political elites, butwere deeply related to the growing clash between the two dominant power elitesin the ruling oligarchy, the Morgan ambit, which included the financial groupssurrounding J.P. Morgan & Company, and the Rockefeller ambit, which included thefinancial groups surrounding Standard Oil. In the latter part of the third partysystem, the Morgans were the dominant interest behind the Democratic Party, andthe Rockefellers behind the Republican Party. While the last Clevelandadministration (1893–1897) was Morgan dominated, the subsequent McKinleyadministrations (1897–1901) were Rockefeller dominated, with the Morgans asjunior partners since they supported McKinley over Bryan. Matters quicklychanged when McKinley was assassinated in 1901 and his vice president, theMorgan affiliated Theodore Roosevelt, took office, and the Morgans were toremain the dominant financial group for the next decade. Ultimately, theRoosevelt administrations (1901–1909) were dominated by the Morgan interests,who were largely able to shield their larger corporations from antitrust anddivert Roosevelt’s “trustbusting” to non-Morgan companies, in particularStandard Oil in 1906. This led to a Rockefeller counterattack, mainly throughthe more Rockefeller-affiliated William Howard Taft, whose administration(1909–1913) launched antitrust suits against the Morgan-dominated companies U.S.Steel and International Harvester. Infuriated at Taft, the Morgans deliberatelysabotaged his reelection by encouraging Roosevelt to come out of retirement andrun on the Progressive Party ticket in 1912, which split the Republican vote andallowed the Democrat Woodrow Wilson, with Morgan and other financialaffiliations, to squeak by and capture the presidency—the only Democrat to do soin the fourth party era.The culmination, the apogee, or the “fulfillment” of not only the new warfarestate but also Progressivism, was during World War I, when collectivist feverwas at its height and there was an enormous desire among businesses,bureaucrats, and intellectuals to top-down cartelize and plan the economy, andto maintain it in some form after the war. In the 1920s, when the Morgans werestill dominant, Progressivist activism, though reduced, continued, especiallythrough the efforts of the Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, and governmentintervention accelerated during his ill-fated term as president, and thenespecially during Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, with its fascist tendencies.The Morgans were to remain dominant throughout the 1920s until they weresavagely removed from political power during the New Deal, which was supportedby the Rockefellers and other anti-Morgan interests. With the end of World WarII the modern American welfare-warfare empire had matured and grown into being,with its roots all from the Progressive Era.The nine chapters of the original book draft and the six published essaysdescribe this thesis, along with its many other facets, in much greater detail.The essays were chosen by the present editor because they were generally hard tofind or had not been published previously in a collection of Rothbard’sessays.[24] [part0006.html#fn24]Chapters 1 and 2, “Railroads: The First Big Business and the Failure of theCartels” and “Regulating the Railroads” document the history of the railroadindustry from the Civil War onward. Much like the later mergers, the railroads,which were previously granted lavish subsidies, tried hard to cartelize on thefree market but failed. Correspondingly, many of them turned to government topush for state enforced cartelization, which led to the Interstate Commerce Actin 1887. Armed with this new legislation, the railroads tried to cartelize butwere not entirely successful, which resulted in future legislative attempts tocontrol the railroad industry until the regulations and rival interestssuffocated the railroads, leading to government ownership during World War I.Chapter 3 “Attempts at Monopoly in American Industry” documents repeated casesof various businesses’ failures to monopolize and consequently saw their marketshare slipping: Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and International Harvester, amongothers. This would later instill the drive for government cartelization.Chapters 4, 5, and 6, “The Third Party System: Pietists vs. Liturgicals,” “TheDemocratic Triumph of 1892,” and “1896: The Collapse of the Third Party Systemand of Laissez-Faire Politics” describe the ethno-cultural background behind thethird party system, and the battles fought between the pietist Republicans andliturgical Democrats. This ultimately led to the election of 1896 where theRepublicans were able to decisively defeat the Democrats, change the future ofAmerican politics, and allow for an unmitigated increase in governmentintervention in the new century with the Democrats permanently weakened.Chapters 7, 8, and 9, “Theodore Roosevelt: The First Progressive, Part I,”“Theodore Roosevelt: The First Progressive, Part II,” and “The National CivicFederation: Big Business Organized for Progressivism” describe the beginnings ofthis new Progressive alliance and the repeated attempts at various forms ofcartelization. The fascinating struggles between the power elites aredocumented, and Theodore Roosevelt is exposed as a Morgan affiliate whoseactions opened the floodgates of Progressivism. The highly touted Progressivereforms are shown to be driven largely by businesses wishing to hamper theircompetitors and bureaucrats interested in enhancing their own power, and theNational Civic Federation is seen as the major organ for the new Progressivepartnership to work through.The remaining chapters are previously published essays. Chapters 10 and 11, “TheProgressive Era and the Family” and “Origins of the Welfare State in America”further describe and elaborate on the recent ethnoreligious history. LocalProgressivism and various urban reforms are described, ranging from the fightover public schools to the welfare state, along with many urban reformers,economists, and other crusaders. Chapters 12 and 13, “War Collectivism in WorldWar I” and “World War I as Fulfillment: Power and the Intellectuals” describeProgressivism during the war, when business collectivism was at its peak, alongwith various other Progressive reforms such as prohibition and women’s suffrage.The evolution of intellectuals and their turn towards increased interventionismand empiricism are also chronicled.[25] [part0006.html#fn25]Chapter 14, “The Federal Reserve as a Cartelization Device: The Early Years,1913–1930” describes the origins of the Federal Reserve and its subsequentmonetary policy during World War I and the 1920s. The Fed is seen to haveoriginated from a coalition of various bankers, especially the Morgans, whowanted a central bank to help them expand credit and solidify the dominance ofNew York City finance. Later on, in the 1920s, the Fed played an increasinglyinternational role in helping Great Britain return to the gold standard, largelythrough the efforts of the governor of the New York Fed Benjamin Strong and hisconnection with the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman. Chapter 15,“Herbert Hoover and the Myth of Laissez-Faire” describes the 1920s Progressivismdriven by Herbert Hoover and refutes the myth that Hoover was anoninterventionist and advocate of laissez-faire while president during theGreat Depression.The Progressive Era is one of Rothbard’s finest achievements as an academic, andshould be read by anyone interested in the Progressive Era or American historyin general. Rothbard’s analysis is essential for anyone who wishes to understandthe evolution of the American state from relatively laissez-faire leanings inthe 19th century to the modern welfare-warfare state of the 20th and 21stcenturies.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The nine chapters of the current volume were rough drafts and in many placeslacked references. No doubt, judging from his later essays, if Rothbard finishedthe book, he would have gone back, revised it, and added a plethora of sourcematerial for the reader. As editor, I have, albeit imperfectly, done my best toedit the manuscript and track down and cite all of the material in the ninechapters. In addition, I have provided commentary and sources for the reader onvarious ideas that Rothbard mentioned and planned to later elaborate on but didnot. These are either in [Editor’s remarks], my additions to existing footnotes,or [Editor’s footnote], my entirely new footnotes.I would like to thank the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and academic vicepresident Joseph Salerno in particular, for providing me with the opportunity towork on this book. Archivist Barbara Pickard was indispensable in tracking downthe book manuscript. In addition, Joseph Salerno, Jonathan Newman, and ChrisCalton were very helpful in proofreading various parts of the book. I would alsolike to thank editor Judy Thommesen for finalizing the book and correctingtypographical mistakes. All errors are entirely my own.Patrick NewmanLakeland, FloridaApril 2017--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0006.html#ft1] David Gordon, The Essential Rothbard (Auburn, AL: MisesInstitute, 2007), p. 7.[2] [part0006.html#ft2] Justin Raimondo, An Enemy of the State: The Life ofMurray N.

Briefly, the thesisis that the rapid upsurge of statism in this period was propelled by a coalitionof two broad groups: (a) certain big business groups, anxious to replace aroughly laissez-faire economy by a new form of mercantilism, cartelized andcontrolled and subsidized by a strong government under their influence andcontrol; and (b) newly burgeoning groups of intellectuals, technocrats, andprofessionals: economists, writers, engineers, planners, physicians, etc.,anxious for power and lucrative employment at the hands of the State. SinceAmerica had been born in an antimonopoly tradition, it became important to putover the new system of cartelization as a “progressive” curbing of big businessby a humanitarian government; intellectuals were relied on for this selling job.These two groups were inspired by Bismarck’s creation of a monopolizedwelfare-warfare state in Prussia and Germany.The big government created by this business-intellectual partnership hadimportant repercussions for all aspects of American life, in addition to thecartelized and regulated economy. For one thing, the drive of pietists andcompulsory “moralists” could now be foisted on the American public in the nameof the newly burgeoning medical “science.” The result: Prohibition, antisexlaws, antidrug laws, and Sunday blue laws. Another result, which made heavy andeffective use of the “morality” theme, was the business-professional drive tocentralize and take over the nation’s cities, thereby reaping good government asagainst the wicked and corrupt old urban machines—which were responsive topoorer and immigrant groups. One of the major aspects of this urbancentralization was to centralize the public school system, and force childreninto them, so that the immigrant Catholic groups would be “Christianized” and beinculcated in the values of the American State and the new system.In foreign affairs, the new partnership of government and business meant asubstitution of a new American imperialism for the older roughly “isolationist”and neutralist foreign policy. The U.S. government was now supposed to open upmarkets for American exports abroad, use coercion to protect American investorsand bondholders overseas, and seize territory on behalf of these aims. It was tobe willing to go to war on behalf of these aims. The increasing militarism alsomeant heavy government contracts and subsidies for favored arms manufacturers.A third group, virtually created by the new system as a junior partner, waslabor unions, which were weak until they were called to share the ruling powerof the “collectivist planning” of World War I. Creating favored unions was aninstrument of cartelization, as well as insuring worker cooperation in the neworder. Partly to mold the immigrants more easily, and partly as a boon to laborunions, immigration was virtually abolished during and after World War I, fueledby the racism sponsored by American social scientists.Thus, from a roughly free and laissez-faire society of the 19th century, whenthe economy was free, taxes were low, persons were free in their daily lives,and the government was noninterventionist at home and abroad, the new coalitionmanaged in a short time to transform America into a welfare-warfare imperialState, where people’s daily lives were controlled and regulated to a massivedegree. In this way, the coalition, inspired by Bismarck’s example and itssuccess in World War I, was able to reach its apogee in Europe, in Mussolini’s“corporate state” and derivative political regimes. In the United States, itsapogee was reached in Roosevelt’s New Deal and post-World War II America.[1][part0007.html#fn1]The purpose of this projected book is to synthesize the remarkable quantity andquality of new and fresh work on the Progressive Era (roughly the late 1890s tothe early 1920s) that has been done in the past 20 years. In particular, theobject is to trace the causes, the nature, and the consequences of the dramaticshift of the U.S. polity from a relatively laissez-faire system to the outlinesof the statist era that we are familiar with today.The older paradigm of historians held the burst of statism in the ProgressiveEra to be the response of a coalition of workers, farmers, and altruisticintellectuals to the rising tide of big business monopoly, with the coalitionbringing in big government to curb and check that monopoly.Research in the past two decades has overthrown that paradigm in almost everydetail. Gabriel Kolko, James Weinstein, James Gilbert, Samuel P. Hays, LouisGalambos and many others have shown that the essence of Progressivism was thatcertain elements of big business, having sought monopoly through cartels andmergers on the free market without success, turned to government—federal, state,and local—to achieve that monopoly through government-sponsored and enforcedcartelization. Modern scholars of Herbert Hoover, such as Ellis W. Hawley, JoanHoff Wilson, William A. Williams, and Robert F. Himmelberg, have confirmed thenew view of Hoover as Progressive and proto-New Dealer.Allied to these big business elements in imposing Progressivism were whatGilbert calls “collectivist intellectuals,” whose goals no longer seem thataltruistic. Rather, they seem like the first great wave of the “New Class” ofmodern intellectuals out for a share of power and for the fruits of similargovernmental cartelization. There has been a proliferation of research in thepast two decades on these intellectuals, ranging from illuminating generalstudies by Gilbert, Christopher Lasch, and Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr., among others,to studies of particular groups of professionals, technocrats, or socialworkers. Much has been done on the history of medical licensing in this period,the rise of the eugenics movement, guild actions by engineers and socialworkers, and the imposition of the anti-sex laws—Donald K. Pickens, Allen F.Davis, David W. Noble, and Ronald Hamowy, are just a few of the studies thatcome to mind.In the last decade, the “new political history” stressing ethno-religiousdeterminants of mass political attitudes, voting, and political parties—notablythe work of Paul Kleppner and others such as Richard J. Jensen, Victor L.Shradar, and Ronald P. Formisano—has added another important dimension to thisstory. Kleppner stresses the intense drive for statism from the mid-19th centuryby the pietist Protestant groups, particularly of the New England stock, asopposed to the laissez-faire and libertarian attitudes of the liturgicalChristians, particularly Catholics and high Lutherans. For the remainder of thecentury, the pietists tried continually to impose prohibition, Sunday blue laws,and enforced public school education as a means of “Christianizing theCatholics”; the liturgicals resisted bitterly. From these personal, religiousmatters, the party leaders (Republican for the pietists, Democrat for theliturgicals) expanded the interests of their followers to the economic realm:the pietists tending to favor big government, subsidies and regulations, theliturgicals in favor of free trade and free markets. Kleppner explains that thetriumph of the Bryan forces in the Democratic Party in 1896 marked the end ofthe Democrats as a laissez-faire party, and the subsequent lack of realelectoral choice left a power vacuum for Progressive technocrats, intellectuals,and businessmen to fill.Tightening public school control as a means of molding Catholic and immigrantchildren became important in the Progressive Era, which saw the completion ofcompulsory education in all the states. The research of Joel Spring, Clarence J.Karier, Colin Greer, and others have revised the older starry-eyed view of thegrowth of the public school system.Many of the Progressive intellectuals can best be described as a fusion ofsupposedly scientific technocracy with a pietist background or pietist allies.As James H. Timberlake points out, the Prohibition movement finally succeededwhen wartime was joined to the dictates of medical “science” and long-timepietist crusading.Finally, Progressivism brought the triumph of institutionalized racism, thedisfranchising of blacks in the South, the cutting off of immigration, thebuilding up of trade unions by the federal government into a tripartite biggovernment, big business, big union alliance, the glorifying of military virtuesand conscription, and a drive for American expansion abroad.In short, the Progressive Era ushered the modern American politico-economicsystem into being. Despite the spate of studies in the past two decades, no onehas yet put all the pieces together into a coherent explanatory framework. Thatwill be the aim of this book.[2] [part0007.html#fn2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0007.html#ft1] [Editor’s footnote] Excerpted from Murray Rothbard,“Roots of the American Corporate State: 1890’s–1920’s” (n.d.).[2] [part0007.html#ft2] [Editor’s footnote] From ibid."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1RAILROADS:THE FIRST BIG BUSINESS AND THE FAILURE OF THE CARTELS1. SUBSIDIZING THE RAILROADSRailroads were the first Big Business, the first large-scale industry, inAmerica. It is therefore not surprising that railroads were the first industryto receive massive government subsidies, the first to try to form substantialcartels to restrict competition, and the first to be regulated by government.[1][part0008.html#fn1]It was the decade of the 1850s, rather than as once believed, the Civil War,that saw the beginnings of America’s epic story of rapid and remarkablegrowth.[2] [part0008.html#fn2] The railroads, leading the parade, had spurtedahead of canals as the major form of inland transportation during the 1840s. Inthe 1850s the railroads established a formidable transportation network as farwest as the Mississippi. During the 1860s, the railroads reached westward acrossthe Continent, spurred by massive federal land grants, which eclipsed stategovernment subsidies in this crucial period.The Republicans had proved able to use their virtual one-party control ofCongress during and immediately after the Civil War, to enact the nationalistand statist economic program they had inherited from the Whigs, a program whichincluded massive subsidies to business in the form of protective tariffs toindustry and land grants to railroads. Before the Civil War, the DemocraticParty, roughly the laissez-faire party since its inception in the late 1820s,had clearly been the permanent majority of the country: the Democrats were onlyout of the presidential office for two terms in over three decades. But with theDemocrats demoralized, seceded from the Union or branded as traitors, theRepublicans saw their golden opportunity and drove through their program.[3][part0008.html#fn3]One example of the way in which the railroads fed at the public trough duringthe 1860s is the case of the 800,000 acre Cherokee tract in southeastern Kansas.The tract was grabbed from the Cherokees by the federal government, and thensold, in one chunk, to James F. Joy, known as “The Railroad King,” and head ofthe Kansas City, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railroad. The sale to Joy, negotiated insecret, was a curious one, since he was not the high bidder for the land. Therewas a great deal of protest when it was discovered that the sale made noprovisions for settlers some 20,000 strong, who had already homesteaded theland. Finally, the government, which had sold the land to Joy at $1.00 an acreon generous credit terms, allowed the settlers to buy their land from Joy for anaverage sum of $1.92 per acre in cash.Joy’s highly favorable treatment at the hands of the federal government may havebeen related to the fact that Secretary of the Interior Orville H. Browning, thedirector of the public lands and the man who had negotiated the sale, was JamesJoy’s brother-in-law. Not only that: Browning had been Joy’s attorney, and wassoon to be so again. And the man employed by Joy to negotiate with Browning overthe Cherokee land was none other than Browning’s own law partner. A cozy littlegroup![4] [part0008.html#fn4]Of nearly 200 million acres of valuable land in the original federal grants,almost half were handed over to the four large transcontinental railroads:Central Pacific, Southern Pacific, Union Pacific, and Northern Pacific.[5][part0008.html#fn5] The typical modus operandi of these railroads was asfollows: (1) a small group of inside promoters and managers would form therailroad, putting up virtually no money of their own; (2) they would use theirpolitical influence to get land grants and outright loans (for the Union andCentral Pacific) from the federal government; (3) they would get aid fromvarious state and local governments; (4) they would issue a huge amount of bondsto sell to the eager public; and (5) they would form a privately-heldconstruction company, issuing themselves bonds and shares, and would then mulctthemselves as managers of the railroad (or rather, mulct railroad shareholdersand bondholders) by charging the road highly inflated construction costs.The Central Pacific was founded by four Sacramento merchants—“The Big Four”:Collis P. Huntington, the dominant partner; Mark Hopkins, the inside man whomanaged the books; Charles Crocker, who ran the construction work; and LelandStanford, who took care of the political end by becoming Governor of California.Stanford saw to it that the state and local governments in California along theroute kicked in substantial aid to the Central Pacific. One example of hismethods occurred when the people of San Francisco voted on a $3 million bondissue to be contributed to the Central Pacific Railroad. To make sure that thepeople voted correctly, the Governor’s brother, Philip Stanford, drove to thepolls and distributed gold pieces to the voters, who duly obliged theirbenefactors.The four founders had the idea of launching the railroad. But how to do so withonly the paltry sum of $200,000 between them? The partners understood where theeconomics of the business truly lay—in obtaining a lucrative federal charter forthe road. Collis Huntington took the $200,000 with him to Washington in histrunk, and when he was through lobbying in Washington, his money was all gone—ina mysteriously unrecorded manner—but the charter for the Central PacificRailroad was theirs. The charter was the key, for it not only handed ninemillion acres in land grants to the road, but it also agreed to pay a subsidy ingovernment bonds, amounting to $26 million to serve as a first mortgage on therailroad. Once the charter was received, money would be pouring into therailroad from federal and state governments, and from the sale of stocks andespecially bonds to the public.The profits siphoned off by the four founders came largely through theircreation of the Credit and Finance Corporation as a separate constructioncompany for the Central Pacific, a company which had the sole right to purchaseall material and actually to construct the road. The CFC was wholly owned anddirected by the four founders of the Central Pacific, and the founders, as headsof the railroad, made sure to pay munificent and extravagant sums to themselvesas the construction company, thereby fleecing the shareholders and bondholdersof the railroad. The railroad paid a total of $79 million to the CFC for theconstruction work, funds acquired from governments and investors, and it hasbeen estimated that over $36 million was in excess of reasonable cost for theconstruction. Typical of the great waste in construction was the time when theburgeoning Central Pacific encountered the small, already existing SacramentoValley Railroad along its route. The economic course would have been to simplybuy the Sacramento Valley road; instead, the Central Pacific built its own,longer line around it in a twisting and senseless route. The reason: “because itwas cheaper to build at the government expense than to buy a railroad alreadyexisting ...”[6] [part0008.html#fn6]The same device was used for the Union Pacific, which, laying track westwardfrom Omaha, joined the Central Pacific in Utah. In this case, the insiders’construction company was the Crédit Mobilier, the federal land grants to therailroad totaled 12 million acres, and the bond subsidy was $27 million. Theinside directors running the Crédit Mobilier charged the Union Pacific $94million for constructing the road, when $44 million was the estimated true cost.This time, the distributor of the largesse to Congressmen and other governmentofficials to induce them to vote for chartering the road was RepublicanRepresentative Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. Ames distributed the stock of thereal profit-maker, the Crédit Mobilier, judiciously to key members of Congressin advance of the vote, either giving them the stock outright or charging themnext to nothing. They became known, unsurprisingly, as the “RailwayCongressmen.” As Ames put it, he distributed the stock “where it will do mostgood for us.” For, “we want more friends in this Congress. There is nodifficulty in getting men to look after their own property.” The payoff listincluded the “Christian Statesman” Vice President Schuyler Colfax of Indiana,James G. Blaine of Maine, Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell, futurepresident James A. Garfield of Ohio, Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, anda dozen other Congressmen, including James Brooks of New York, House minorityleader, as a sop to the Democrats. As for Oakes Ames himself, he not onlyreceived some stock for his trouble, but his shovel manufacturing firmsurprisingly received the Crédit Mobilier contract for shovels in constructingthe railroad.[7] [part0008.html#fn7]The railroad financier with closest ties to the Republican administrations wasthe redoubtable banker, Jay Cooke, head of Jay Cooke & Co. A small Philadelphiafinancier at the outset of the Civil War, Cooke had the vision to found hisbanking house and to wangle from the federal government a monopoly onunderwriting the massive bond issues floated during the war. To sell them to thegullible public, Cooke launched the first modern propaganda campaign for sellingthe bonds, employing thousands of subagents and such slogans for the credulousas “A national debt a national blessing.”Cooke obtained the highly lucrative monopoly underwriting concession fromWashington through his influence on Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase.Cooke’s journalist brother, Henry, was a long-time aide of Chase, from thelatter’s tenure of Governor of Ohio. Henry then followed Chase to Washington.After extensive wining and dining of Chase, and after demonstrating hispropaganda methods in selling government bonds, Jay Cooke won the covetedconcession that was to make him one of the richest men in America and his newJay Cooke & Co. by far the leading investment bank. Cooke became widely known as“The Tycoon,” and the phrase “as rich as Jay Cooke” became a popular saying.Cooke found many ingenious ways to expand the market for his bonds. He bribedfinancial reporters and Congressmen extensively, and he demanded kickbacks inbond purchases from every war contractor and military supplier. Particularlyadroit was Cooke’s success in taking Chase’s plan and persuading Congress totransform the American banking system. The notes of state chartered banks, whichconstituted all the banks in the country before the onset of the Civil War, weretaxed out of existence by the federal government, to be replaced by the notes ofa few newly chartered, large-scale national banks. The legal structure of thenational banks, in turn, was such that the amount of bank notes they could issuewas based on how many federal bonds they held. Hence, by lobbying for a new,centralized banking system dependent upon government bonds, Cooke assuredhimself a huge increase in the market for the very bonds over which he hadacquired a monopoly.[8] [part0008.html#fn8]Considering Cooke’s credentials, it is no wonder that the biggest land bonanzaof all the railroad charters, the Northern Pacific, enjoying its federal gift of47 million acres, should have fallen into the hands of the Tycoon, in 1869.Before launching actual construction of the Northern Pacific, Cooke lobbied inWashington in 1870 for a new charter, which provided for Jay Cooke & Co. to bethe sole fiscal agent of the railroad, and for Cooke’s bank to receive theenormous fee of 12% as well as 20% in Northern Pacific stock, for all bonds itwas able to sell.Thus, Cooke did not need a separate construction company to mulct the othershareholders and bondholders of the railroad, as did his counterparts in theCentral and Union Pacific boondoggles; for he already had his private bankinghouse in place. Cooke’s handsome charter was aided by the fact that America’sleading politicians rushed to help the Northern Pacific in return for shares ofits stock. Cooke’s old friend, the now Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,Salmon P. Chase, even offered to become president of the Northern Pacific at a“good salary.” Other powerful stockholders brought in by Cooke were: VicePresident Schuyler Colfax, future President Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, andSecretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. President Ulysses S. Grant’swholehearted favor was assured by the influence of his old friend and advisorHenry Cooke, and of his private secretary, General Horace Porter, who offeredhis friendly services to Cooke in return for a handsome bribe.The payoff to Northern Pacific was opposed by a rival group, who sought similarfavors for a new Southern Pacific Railroad. The major backer for the SouthernPacific group was Speaker of the House James G. Blaine, of Maine, one of thepowers of the Republican Party. To persuade Blaine of the error of his ways, JayCooke & Co. granted the Speaker a sizable personal loan based on collateral thatwas not investigated with the bank’s usual care.With the charter firmly in tow, Jay Cooke geared up a mammoth propaganda machinesuch as he had used to successfully sell government bonds in the Civil War.Traveling agents were hired, and newspapermen were systematically bribed to singthe praises of the Northern Pacific and of the climate along its prospectiveroute. The purpose was twofold: to induce the general public to buy NorthernPacific bonds; and to induce settlers to immigrate to the Northwesternterritories along the route. The migrants would have to buy the land granted tothe railroad and to become customers of the railroad after it was built. Favoredstockholder Henry Ward Beecher, the most celebrated minister in the country,wrote blurbs for the railroad in his Christian Union; and Cooke’s hiredpamphleteers had the fertile imagination to claim the climate of the futurestates of Minnesota and Montana to be “a cross between Paris and Venice.”[9][part0008.html#fn9]By the early 1870s, however, the bonanza era for the railroads and theirpromoters had come to an abrupt end. The reasons were threefold. In the firstplace, there was a general revulsion at the way in which the railroads had beenable to outdo each other in feeding hugely at the public trough. 1871 was theyear of the last federal land grant to the railroads, for the decade of the1870s saw a widespread “antimonopoly” movement, which also succeeded in slowingdown state and local aid to new railroads. In some states, new constitutionsprohibited government loans to corporations (which, in those days, meant mainlyrailroads).The revulsion against public partnership with railroads coincided with thesecond reason, the renaissance of the Democratic Party. For the eagermercantilism of the 1860s reflected the virtual absence in Congress on thepolitical scene of the traditionally laissez-faire party. By the early 1870s,the Democratic Party had recouped its fortunes, only to have the presidentialelection purloined from Samuel Tilden in 1876. From the early 1870s to themid-1890s, the Democratic Party was to be almost as strong as the Republicans,often controlling at least one house of Congress if not so often the presidencyitself. Apart from their ideological affinities, the Democrats could be expectedto make political capital out of Republican corruption, so much of which hadcentered on the railroads.The third reason for the end of the railroad bonanza was the shocking bankruptcyand collapse of the mighty Jay Cooke in the Panic of 1873.[10][part0008.html#fn10] One problem with massive government aid is that itsubsidizes inefficiency, and the far from completed Northern Pacific wasincreasingly in huge financial arrears. Also, the Tycoon’s touch in sellingbonds was no longer so magical as it had been in peddling government securities.Led by the powerful Rothschilds, European bankers and investors stayed away indroves from Northern Pacific bonds—a striking contrast to the general enthusiasmof European investors in American railroads during the latter half of the 19thcentury. Meanwhile, at home, the brash new firm of investment bankers, Drexel,Morgan & Co., headed by Cooke’s Philadelphia rival, Anthony Drexel, and by youngJohn Pierpont Morgan of New York, acted against Cooke and helped bring about thefailure of Cooke’s U.S. government bond issue in early 1873. Half a year later,all of these factors combined to cause the failure and bankruptcy of Jay Cooke &Co., precipitating the Panic of 1873. As a result, Cooke was now succeeded byJ.P. Morgan as the nation’s leading investment banker.[11] [part0008.html#fn11]Since Morgan was a Democrat, his ascension symbolized the important politicalshift returning the country to a genuine two-party system.2. THE RATIONALE OF RAILROAD PRICINGThe “anti-monopoly” and later movements that wanted government to do somethingabout the railroads arose partly in response to the outrageous handouts thatgovernment had granted to the roads. The healthy demand of the protestors was tostop or rollback the subsidies: the former successfully stopped the land grantprocess, while the latter focused on a demand for local governments to taxunused land that the railroads had received as a bonus and were holding off themarket. Many of the protestors went further, however, and demanded various formsof regulation to hold down railroad rates, especially for freight, which waseconomically far more significant than passenger service.The public demand for rate regulation, when not based on self-interest (as willbe seen below), reflected a profound ignorance of the basic economics ofrailroad pricing. The idea that rates were in some sense “too high,” or thatrailroads were monopolies, ran against the hard fact that railroads weretremendously and even fiercely competitive, and that the consuming public wasbeing served, not only by land-based transportation across the Continent,[12][part0008.html#fn12] but also by continued, competitive, and substantiallowering of freight rates.Railroads competed between the same cities and towns, they also competed witheach other between regions, and they competed with canals and coastal shipping.Obviously, as in any other commodity pricing, the prices of railway rates wereset by the degree of competition in the various areas. Along routes whererailroads competed directly with canals or coastal shipping, freight rates wereforced lower than where such competition did not exist. There was intra-railroadcompetition between regions developing between the several transcontinentalrailroad routes. There was also fierce competition between the five competing“trunk lines” between the Eastern cities and the Midwest—The Erie, Baltimore &Ohio (B&O), Pennsylvania, New York Central, and Grand Trunk. It is interestingthat, in their public arguments, the various railroads argued that rates“should” be set in accordance with whatever pricing “theory” benefited theparticular road. Thus, the Baltimore & Ohio and Pennsylvania railroads, whichwere the shortest of the five trunk lines, argued that rates should be setaccording to distance, which of course would allow them to undercut theircompetitors. The New York Central, which had the lowest costs of operation(easier grades, denser traffic, etc.) argued that rates should be determinedsolely by operating costs. And the Grand Trunk, weak and perpetually teeteringon the edge of bankruptcy, claimed that prices should only be high enough tocover operating costs, ignoring dividends and interest.[13] [part0008.html#fn13]There was also vigorous competition between railroads serving the same cities.By the mid-1880s, indeed, there was scarcely a large town in the United Statesthat wasn’t served by two or more railroads. For one example, there were in thisperiod no less than 20 competitive railway routes between St. Louis and Atlanta.Complaints by customers (farmers, merchants, and other shippers) and by thegeneral public about freight rates generally centered around the railroadpractice of multiform pricing, of charging one shipper different rates fromanother. In each case, the shippers paying higher rates denounced the action as“price discrimination” stemming from some sort of conspiracy indulged in by therailroads. But in each case, there were sound economic reasons for the pricingpractice. The complaints may be grouped into several categories.(1) Continuing complaints that railroads were charging lower, proportional,per-mile rates for long-haul as compared to short-haul traffic. But such pricingwas the result, not of some demonic conspiracy against the short-haul areas, butof the economics of the situation. In the first place, railroads had high fixedterminal costs—the costs of loading and unloading at the two terminals for eachshipment—which were incurred regardless of the length of the trip. These wouldtend to yield lower rates for longer hauls. Secondly, the Western railroads, inparticular, were built far ahead of traffic and therefore had to keep freightrates low in order to induce farmers and others to develop the region. Thiswould account for lower “through,” long-haul interstate rates from West to East.The Eastern farmers, hit hard by the competition from the West, were of coursemore disposed to rail about conspiracy than to consult the economic reasons forthe differences in freight rates. They complained about the resulting loss oftheir “natural” markets in the Eastern cities. Similar bitter complaints abouthigher rates were indulged in by Eastern merchants and agricultural-basedmanufacturers, who saw themselves outcompeted by products made further west.Thus, millers in Rochester denounced the lower freight rates enjoyed to theirNew York City makers by the millers in Minneapolis.(2) One would think that the Western farmers, at least would be delighted by thelower rates on long-haul through traffic from West to East. But true to bothhuman nature and the political value of pressure and complaints, the Westernfarmers, too, claimed to be unhappy. They protested the higher local rates theyhad to pay, as well as the discounts that railroads gave to large as compared tosmall shippers.The rationale for granting discounts for large shipments should be familiar tothe current reader. Larger orders reduce the risk of producing or shipping adesired minimum volume; and larger orders are less costly to process, sincethere is a certain fixed cost for writing out and processing any given order.(3) As indicated above, railroad rates will naturally tend to be lower wherecompetition is fiercer, either with other roads in the same town, other regions,or with other forms of transportation. Thus, New York City, with many competingrailroads, paid far lower rates per mile on grain shipped from Chicago than didPittsburgh, which was only served by one railroad, the Pennsylvania. Worchester,Massachusetts merchants paid more for their Western grain than did the merchantsfrom more distant Boston. Naturally, the result was continued grumbling fromcities which considered themselves disadvantaged.(4) The most intense and persistent griping over alleged geographical freightrate “discrimination” has been Southern charges that the South has always beenforced to pay substantially higher freight rates than other regions,particularly the East. In a notable article, the eminent historian David M.Potter has explained these persistently higher Southern rates by demonstratingtheir economic rationale.[14] [part0008.html#fn14]Potter uncovered several reasons for the higher freight rates in the South. Inthe first place, the density of population is greater in the East, the lowerdensity of traffic in the South imposing higher costs. Secondly, the principalshipment from the South has been cotton. Railroads early realized that they hadto “classify” commodities when deciding on freight rates; for heavy, bulkycommodities selling at a low cost per unit weight could not afford to pay thehigh freight rates per ton-mile that lighter-weight, more specialized consumercommodities could afford. Hence, if they were to move these bulky commodities atall, the railroads had to classify the bulky commodities such as coal, wheat,livestock, ore, or cotton into lower rate categories than, say, groceries orclothing. Hence, to make up for the low rates which the Southern railroads hadto charge for cotton, they had to set comparatively high rates on other,higher-grade goods, including Northern goods that were shipped southward.Thirdly, it was the peculiarity of Southern rail traffic that there were for along time no trunk roads for long-haul traffic from the South to the Easternmarkets. Instead, the railroad traffic was local, carrying produce from theinterior to the coastal ports, thence to ship by the coastal trade. Localtraffic meant higher freight rates. Indeed, the stiff water competition in muchof the South—one the coastal route, by river boats on the large and smallrivers—meant unusually lower railroad rates on the competing routes, andcorrespondingly higher local rates where this competition was absent.Fourthly, even after trunk lines were built, the only through traffic wastriangular: shipping foodstuffs from the Midwest to the South, and cotton fromSouth to East. This meant one-way traffic, a costly process which meant littleor no return shipments to reduce overhead costs. Again, the result was higherthrough rates in the Southern trade.(5) Particularly troubling to critics was the practice of railroads in granting“rebates” off freight rates to their shippers. It was charged that the practicewas discriminatory and monopolistic and was used to grant special privileges tofavored shippers, such as Standard Oil.What the critics failed to realize was that, far from being in some way“monopolistic,” granting rebates was precisely the major way by which railroadscompeted with each other and with other forms of transportation. The practice ofgiving discounts off list price to attract or hold customers is a common one inindustry now, and there are few accusations that the custom is eithermonopolistic or discriminatory. The point is that business firms,understandably, do not like to cut prices. If they are forced, by competition,to cut prices, they try at first not to change their lists, but instead, hopingsuch cuts will be temporary, grant off-list discounts to their customers. Theprice-cutting process begins with one or two customers, either to gain newcustomers or to keep them from shifting to a competitor.If the discounts cannot be sustained, they will disappear and the list will bemaintained; but if the general trend turns out to be toward lower prices, thediscounts or rebates will spread, especially as other customers tend to find outand demand similar treatment. In short, lower prices will tend to manifestthemselves through the spread of discounts off-list.[15] [part0008.html#fn15]There is another reason for the prevalence of rebates: that businesses are oftenwilling to charge less in return for a definite order. As one railroad manexplained in U.S. Senate hearings on the widespread use of rebates: “A man maysay, ‘I can give you so much business.’ If you can depend on that you may makedefinite arrangements accordingly.”[16] [part0008.html#fn16]We can see, then, that pricing in the business world, in contrast to the neatlydetermined quantities and charts of the economics textbooks, is a continuingprocess of discovery—of trying to figure out what the best and most profitableprices may be in any given situation.[17] [part0008.html#fn17] This isparticularly true of railroads, which have had to price literally thousands ofitems over a myriad of different routes and conditions.Perhaps this complexity of the discovery process accounts for the fact thatrailroad rebates, far from being confined to a few large shippers such asStandard Oil, were widespread during the latter half of the 19th century forpetroleum refining as well as in most other industries. Such rebates were one ofthe major ways in which railroads competed with each other. Thus, the New YorkCentral typically had six thousand cases of “special contracts,” or rebates,outstanding; and in California, rebates were granted on virtually everycontract. Reductions off list could easily go as far as 50%.(6) At once the most important and the most absurd charge was that railroadrates were “too high” in the decades after the Civil War. There is, first ofall, the lack of any rational and non-arbitrary standard to determine how highor how low the price “should have been.” But, apart from that, one of theremarkable phenomena of these decades was the continuing and massive fall infreight rates over the years. It was an era that ushered in a new age of cheaptransportation over vast distances.Generally, the railroad rates fell, as did other prices, during recessions, butdid not rise nearly as much during succeeding booms. As a result, the trend wasrapidly downward. These were glorious decades in America when the increasedsupply of goods and services emanating from our own Industrial Revolutionlowered most prices. As in all of the 19th century except for periods of wartimeinflation, the general trend of prices was downward. But even in relation toother falling prices, the fall in railroad freight rates was truly remarkable.The fall in rates took several forms. One was an outright and evident fall innominal rates. Over the decades, these nominal rates fell by one-half totwo-thirds. Thus, the price for shipping wheat from Chicago to New York fellfrom 65 cents per 100 pounds in 1866 to 20 cents thirty-one years later. Dressedbeef shipments between the two cities fell from 90 cents per 100 pounds in 1872to 40 cents by the end of the century. In westbound traffic from New York toChicago, the most expensive, or Class 1 goods, fell in price from $2.15 per 100pounds in the spring of 1865, to $.75 at the end of 1888. Class 4 goods fell,during the same period, from $.96 to $.35.The most remarkable rate cuts occurred during the great rate wars of 1876–77,between the great trunk lines, soon after the completion of the Baltimore & Ohioroute to Chicago in 1874. Class 1 rates fell, in those two years, from $.75 to$.25 per 100 pounds, while class 4 rates fell to $.16. Eastbound freight ratesfrom Chicago to New York dropped phenomenally by 85%, from $1.00 to $.15.Passenger rates were cut in half in this brief period.Apart from the outright reductions in rates, real freight rates were alsolowered by improving the services supplied by the railroads, such as providingstorage or carting services without charge. One particular method of loweringfreight rates without nominally doing so was by systematically re-classifyingcommodities from higher to lower-paying categories. Thus, the nominal rates ineach class could remain the same, but if goods were transferred from higher tolower rate categories, the real effect was to lower the cost of railroadtransportation. For example, before 1887, two-thirds of all the items shippedwestward in trunk-line roads were bracketed into high class 1 to class 3categories; after that year, reclassification in 1887 left only 53% of the itemsin these highest three classes.That same year, a huge increase was granted by the trunk lines in the number oftypes of items that were entitled to lower rates for being shipped in fullcarload lots. Before that year, only 14% of westbound items on the trunk lineswere entitled to discounts in carloads; afterwards, fully 55% of the items wereentitled to the same privilege. Hence, real freight rates fell because moreitems could now obtain quantity discount privileges.[18] [part0008.html#fn18]Overall, railroad rates had fallen far below the wildest dreams of the Grangersand the other anti-railroad movements of the 1870s. Albert Fishlow, indeed,estimates that, by 1910, “real freight rates [had fallen by] more than 80percent from their 1849 level, and real passenger charges 50 percent.”[19][part0008.html#fn19]One particularly piquant group of complainers against the railroads were therailroad investors themselves. Often mulcted by unscrupulous promoters andinside managers (as in the case of the major transcontinental roads), induced byeager local, state, and federal governments to over-expand and wastefully managetheir operations, the railroad owners found, over the decades, a none toomunificent rate of return sinking even lower. Thus, around 1870, railroad bondyields averaged about 6% while stock dividends were approximately 7%; by the endof the century, average bond yields had sunk to 3.3% and dividends to 3.5%. Inaddition to this virtually 50% drop, only 30–40% of railroad stock paid anydividend at all during the 1890s.[20] [part0008.html#fn20] Railroad bankruptciesand reorganizations were extensive during the same decade.3. THE ATTEMPTS TO FORM CARTELSEarly in the career of large-scale railroads, some railroad men sought a way outfrom the rigors of competition and competitive price-cutting. What they soughtwas the time-honored device of the cartel agreement, in which all the firms in acertain industry agree to raise their selling prices. If the firms could betrusted to abide by the agreement, then all could raise prices and every firmcould benefit.The general public conceives of price-raising and price-fixing agreements to beas easy as a whispered conversation over cocktails at the club. They are,however, extremely difficult to arrange and even harder to maintain. For priceshave been driven low by the competition of supply and production; in order toraise prices successfully, the firms will also have to agree to cut production.And there is the sticking point: for no business firm, no entrepreneur, and nomanager likes to cut production. What they prefer to do is expand. And, if thebusinessman is to agree, grudgingly, to cut production, he has to make sure thathis competitors will do the same. And then there will be interminable quarrelsabout how much production each firm is supposed to cut. Thus, if several firmsare, collectively, producing 1 million tons of Metal X and selling it at $100 aton, and the firms wish to agree to raise the price to $150 a ton, they willhave to agree on how far below the million tons to cut production, and whoshould cut how much. And such agreements are at best very difficult to arriveat.But this is only the beginning of the headaches in store for our cartelists.Generally, they will agree on quota production cuts under the output of a baseyear, usually the current year of operation. So, if the cartel is being formedin the year 1978, firms A, B, C, etc. may each agree to cut its output in 197920% below the previous year. But very quickly in the cartel agreement, and moreand more as time goes on, human nature is such that each businessman and manageris thinking as follows: “Darn it, why am I stuck with the maximum productionbased on 1978 production? This is now 1979 (or 1980, etc.) and now we haveinstalled such-and-such a new process, or we have such-and-such a hotshotproduct or salesman, that I know, if our company were all free to compete and tocut prices, we could sell more, pick up a larger share of the market, and makemore profits, than we did that year.” As 1978 recedes more and more into thepast, and 1978 conditions become more obsolete, each firm chafes increasingly atthe bit, longing to be able to cut prices and compete once more. A firm mightpetition the cartel for an increased quota, but other firms, whose productionwould have to be cut, would protest bitterly and turn down the request.Eventually, the internal pressures within the cartel become too great, and thecartel falls apart, prices tumbling once more. A characteristic pattern ofcartel breaking is secret price-cutting. The restless firm, anxious to cutprices, decides to try to have its cake and eat it too. While its boobishfellow-producers keep sticking to the agreed cartel price of, say, $150 a ton,our hypothetical firm approaches a few customers whom it is anxious to keep, orothers whom it is eager to acquire. “Look, because you’re such a great personand your firm is such a good one, I’m going to let you have our metal for $130 aton. In return, I want you to keep quiet about it, so that your and ourcompetitors won’t find out about the deal.” For a few months, this will work,and the firm will be reaping extra profits at its competitors’ expense. But,truth will get out, and eventually the word spreads to the firm’s othercustomers and competitors about the secret price-cut. Other customers willdemand similar treatment, the competitors will self-righteously denounce ourfirm as a “rate-buster,” a “cheat,” and a traitor, and the cartel will dissolvein intensified competition, price-cutting, and intra-industry recriminations.That is one inexorable way in which a cartel will break up: from internalpressure, pressures arising from the firms within the cartel. But there isanother, equally formidable, source of insurmountable pressure to crack thecartel: external pressure, from outside the cartel. For here is the cartel inour hypothetical metal industry. Outside firms, outside investors, clear-sightedentrepreneurs seeking profits, look at this industry and see that a cartel hasbeen formed, its price has gone up by 50%, and consequently, the industry is nowenjoying unaccustomed profits. To extend our hypothetical case, suppose that thecartel has raised its profits from 5% to 15%. Outside investors say: “Aha! Thesefellows have a good thing going. Why shouldn’t I, who am not bound in any senseby the cartel agreement, nip into this industry, build a new plant and a newfirm, and undercut the cartel? I could sell at $130 a ton, and besides, I couldbuild an entirely new plant with the latest equipment and the latest processes,while these fellows would have to compete possessing older and partiallyobsolete plants.” And so, the higher price and the higher profit rates acts asan umbrella and a lure to tempt new and possibly more competitive firms into theindustry.How will the cartel meet the challenge of new and dangerous competitors? If itwishes to keep the high cartel price, it will have to draw the new firm into thecartel, by assigning the firm a production quota of its own. But that would meanthat the old firms, each of which detests the idea of cutting production in thefirst place, would have to cut still more—and all for the benefit of a new andunwelcome interloper. It is unlikely that the new firm could be absorbed intothe cartel, and therefore the likely event is a breakup of the cartel, withprices tumbling down again. Except that this time the permanent result will be amenacing new competitor which might well out-compete and drive out some of theexisting firms. And even if the new firm is absorbed into the cartel, thesuccess can only be temporary, since more new firms will continue to beattracted to the industry, and the problem will begin all over again.Eventually, the cartel will bust up, from the external pressure of new entrantsinto the industry.Thus, every cartel, every voluntary agreement by competing firms to raise pricesand cut production, will inexorably break apart from internal and/or externalpressures. A cartel cannot long succeed on the free market.[21][part0008.html#fn21]In every industry that has ever attempted the cartel device, the story has beenthe same repeatedly confirming the above basic economic insight. In the case ofthe railroads, the plot repeats itself, except that the cartels were called“pools,” production was freight shipments, prices were freight rates, andprice-cutting took the form of secretly increasing rebates to shippers.The first important railroad pool was the Iowa Pool, formed in 1870.[22][part0008.html#fn22] The twin cities of Omaha, Nebraska—Council Bluffs, Iowawere the eastern terminus of the great new transcontinental UnionPacific-Central Pacific route to California. The rail route from Chicagowestward to Omaha therefore took on enormous importance. There were three majorcompeting routes between Chicago and Omaha: the most northerly, the Chicago andNorthwestern; the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific (“The Rock Island Line”);and the most southerly “Burlington System” (among other things, interconnectingthe Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy with the Burlington and Missouri railroads).As luck would have it, the three competitors were controlled by two businessmenand their associates. The entire Burlington System was controlled by James F.Joy, the “Railroad King,” backed by a group of Boston capitalists. Meanwhile,John F. Tracy, backed by numerous capitalists, including Dutch finance,controlled both the Chicago and Northwestern and the Rock Island Line.With only two businessmen controlling the three competing lines, conditionsseemed ripe for a cartel. Both men were eager for the experiment, since both Joyand Tracy had overborrowed in order to acquire their holdings and were in shakyfinancial shape. And so, in late 1870, Tracy initiated the formation of the IowaPool, which tried to prop up freight rates by reducing aggregate traffic and bypooling half the earnings of the three lines and equally dividing thePool—thereby greatly reducing the incentive to engage in competitiveprofit-seeking or price-cutting.[23] [part0008.html#fn23]Despite the seemingly favorable conditions, and the long official life of thecartel (until 1884), the Iowa Pool was plagued with grave difficulties from thevery beginning and broke up after only four years. Competitive rate-cutting,breaking the agreement, occurred early and on many levels. There was, first,severe rate-cutting even within the Burlington System and within the Tracyholdings—the sales managers and managerial heads of each railroad understandablywishing to increase the profits of their own organization. There was alsovigorous competition and rate-cutting between the Burlington and the Tracyrailroads, with charges of “cheating” rife between the various parties. Butintra- and inter-organizational rivalry did not complete the competitive picturein the Iowa Pool. For the entire transcontinental railroad system was also invigorous competition with the Pacific Mail Steamship line, which sailed betweenthe East and West Coasts with overland carriage across Panama. In 1870 there wasalso an agreement between the Steamship line and Union Pacific to prop upfreight rates and allocate an agreed division of traffic between railroad andsteamship: in effect, to impose maximum shipping quotas on each mode oftransportation in order to raise freight rates. By 1873, however, a rate wardeveloped between the steamships and the railroads, helping to push the entirePool into collapse a year later.Another important factor in the breakup of the Pool was the intervention of theUnion Pacific. For one of the first actions of the Iowa Pool was the demand ofthe Union Pacific a higher share of the transcontinental, Chicago-San Franciscorailroad income. Angered, the Union Pacific decided to crush this demand bydealing with the individual members of the Burlington System, and also byshifting more business to the St. Louis rather than the Chicago terminus. Allthis competition, from within and without the Pool, led to its collapse afteronly four years of turbulent operation.[24] [part0008.html#fn24]The next important pool was an attempt to cartelize trunk line railroads insofaras they were making shipments in the burgeoning new petroleum industry. Eversince the first oil well had been drilled in Titusville, Pa. in 1859, crude oilhad been extracted from western Pennsylvania oil fields and refined largely inCleveland. At the behest of Thomas A. Scott, head of the Pennsylvania Railroad,in 1871 three great trunk lines, the Pennsylvania, the Erie, and the New YorkCentral formed the South Improvement Company. In order to raise freight rates,the company allocated maximum quotas of oil shipments among themselves. ThePennsylvania was to obtain 45% of oil shipments, while the Erie and the New YorkCentral were each allocated 27.5% of the oil freight. To make sure that therailroads stuck to their agreement, a group of oil refiners was brought into thepact, the refiners being pledged to act as “eveners” to insure that eachrailroad would not exceed its quota of petroleum freight.What were the refiners to get in return for providing such essential service tothe railroad cartel? They were to obtain freight rebates up to 50%. Furthermore,they were promised a subsidy amounting to a rebate on all oil shipments made byrefiners outside the South Improvement Company agreement. And since the refinerswithin the group were acting as eveners for all petroleum shipments made bythese railroads, they received waybills for these shipments and were thereforeable to police the honesty of the railroads in keeping the subsidy agreement.Oil refining was a highly competitive industry, and so, despite the fact thatthe South Improvement pool meant higher freight rates, some refiners werewilling to join the pool in order to gain a rebate-and-subsidy advantage overtheir competitors. Besides, they might succeed in cartelizing oil refining aswell. The complying refiners were led by the largest oil refiner in theindustry, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company of Ohio (SOHIO).Originating in 1867 as the partnership of Rockefeller, Flagler & Andrews Co.,SOHIO was formed as a $1 million corporation three years later. WhileRockefeller was hardly averse to achieving a monopoly, he was skeptical of thesuccess of the cartel and entered it only with reluctance. The South ImprovementPool, indeed, turned out to be still-born; when news of the agreement leakedout, angry pressure by the other refiners and by crude oil producers forced thedissolution of the cartel. As will be seen below in Chapter 3, John D.Rockefeller then turned to the merger route in an attempt to achieve a monopolyin oil refining.[25] [part0008.html#fn25]The first important Eastern pool was formed in August 1874. Competition betweenthe great East-Midwest trunk lines had been intense during the Panic of 1873,with a consequent decline in freight rates. The three major trunk lines—New YorkCentral, Erie, and Pennsylvania—were also worried about the imminent completionof a new competition in the Baltimore & Ohio, which would clearly send ratesdown further. As a result, the presidents of the three trunk lines met atSaratoga, New York, at the home of New York Central’s William H. Vanderbilt, andhammered out an agreement to keep up freight rates, and to appoint two regionalcommissions to enforce the agreement.But the trunk line agreement soon dissolved from pressures both within andoutside the cartel. John W. Garrett, president of the B&O, decided to keep outof the agreement in the hope of outcompeting the other roads and picking up alarger share of the freight business. Externally, the Grand Trunk of Canada tookadvantage of the pact to open up a new northerly trunk line route from Chicagoto Boston via Canada. The result was a speedy collapse of the agreement, andbitter rate wars between the trunk lines followed during 1875 and particularly1876.[26] [part0008.html#fn26]Desperate, the trunk lines called in Albert Fink, German-born engineer andformer vice president of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad who had become theforemost theoretician, promoter, and manager of railroad pools. By 1873, Finkwas urging for the railroads to raise and equalize their rates, and to do itthrough cartel agreements and divisions of the traffic. Fink was fresh fromforming the Southern Railway and Steamship Association in the fall of 1875, inwhich 32 railway lines formed such an agreement, naming Fink himself ascommissioner of the Association with power to supervise the agreement.In 1877, the trunk lines decided to call in Fink to help them try again. InApril, the four largest trunk lines signed the Seaboard Differential Agreement,fixing eastbound freight rates to Philadelphia and Baltimore at 2 and 3 centsper 100 pounds less than to New York or Boston. On westbound traffic,differentials on some freight was the same; on others, it was as much as 6 and 8cents per 100 pounds. The Seaboard Agreement reflected a shift of power from NewYork to Baltimore and Philadelphia, with Vanderbilt’s New York Central and theErie forced to agree to maintain freight rates higher than the PennsylvaniaRailroad, which had its eastern terminus in Philadelphia, or the B&O, whichended in Baltimore. The agreement was engineered by Philadelphia financierAnthony J. Drexel and J.P. Morgan of Drexel, Morgan, and Co., a majorstockholder as well as creditor of the Baltimore & Ohio. Pressure was also puton by allied English bankers, headed by Morgan’s father Junius S. Morgan.In July 1877, a reinforcing agreement between the four trunk lines allocatedquotas of all westbound freight from New York: the Erie and the New York Centralto receive 33% each, the Pennsylvania 25%, and the remaining 9% to the B&O.Moreover, the railroads established a Trunk Line Association, headed by AlbertFink, to regulate and supervise the pool and rate agreements. August of thefollowing year, the trunk lines and major Western railroads expanded the cartelidea to form a Western Executive Committee to fix and raise rates and poolfreight; and in December, at the suggestion of the ubiquitous Fink, the TrunkLine Association and Western Executive Committee formed a Joint ExecutiveCommittee to supervise the entire integrated agreement, headed again by AlbertFink. Fink and the Joint Executive also supervised regional subcommittees in allthe major cities included in the agreement. By 1881, pooling of freight wasextended to eastbound traffic as well.And yet, this mightiest and continuing attempt to create a voluntary railroadpool proved, like its predecessors, to be a dismal failure. From the beginning,the Grand Trunk line of Canada kept cutting rates, and the completion of theGrand Trunk line to Chicago made matters worse. Furthermore, rate cutting byrailroads within the cartel kept plaguing Fink and the railroads, largelythrough secret rebates which Fink could not detect until it was too late andmuch damage had been done to the rate structure and the relative shares of themarket. Competitive rebates to shippers were concealed by such deceptive devicesas billing freight from more distant points than actually used, under-recordingof weight, and spurious classification of freight into cheaper categories offreight rates than had been agreed. Fink tried to counter these practices with asystem of freight inspection, but lacking coercive police power, there waslittle that he could do.As early as February 1878, Fink attempted to blacklist all railroad executivesgranting secret rebates; but, a month later, the division of freight betweenDetroit and Milwaukee was already collapsing in competitive rate and shippingwars. In 1878 and again in 1880 severe rate wars and competition for freightbroke out between the trunk lines themselves.From the beginning of the agreement, the merchants and shippers of New York hadbeen understandably unhappy at the fixed competitive disadvantage that New Yorkwas suffering in relation to Philadelphia and Baltimore. Finally, in 1881, underpressure from these merchants and their Boards of Trade, the New York Centralbroke ranks and initiated a fierce rate war; in three months during 1881,freight rates were cut in half, East and West. Fink tried desperately to stemthe tide by gaining an agreement to raise rates to the pre-rate war level and totry to crack down on zealous railroad sales managers (freight agents and freightsolicitors) who engaged in secret rebates in order to gain sales. But all thiswas in vain. In March 1882, Fink and the Joint Executive tried once more,appointing a Joint Agent at every important traffic center, with the power toexamine all the railroads’ books and bills of lading. But by the end of theyear, this attempt had collapsed as well.One of the major reasons for the failure of Fink and the trunk cartels was thetruly heroic activities of one of the most maligned railroad financiers of thisera: Jay Gould. In his search for profits, Gould was inadvertently the people’schampion by his inveterate activities as “traitor” and “rate-buster,” as wreckerof railroad cartels.[27] [part0008.html#fn27] Ever alert to profits to be madefrom undercutting railroad pools and cartels, Gould would either break theagreement from within or build external railroads to compete with the bloatedand vulnerable railroad pool.Thus, it was Gould who initiated much of the Eastern rate wars of 1881–1883 bybuilding the West Shore Railroad in New Jersey as well as the Delaware,Lackawanna and Western in New York to compete directly with the New YorkCentral.[28] [part0008.html#fn28] In his fascinating re-evaluation of Jay Gould,Julius Grodinsky demonstrates how this “disturber of the peace” benefited thepublic and shippers by continually building new railroads and breaking railroadpools and rate agreements. Gould performed this function repeatedly in theMiddle-West and West, as well as the East. Grodinsky also points out that theextensive rate wars initiated by Gould in the 1870s and 1880s left freight ratespermanently far lower than they had been before. And that Gould’s rate-cuttingbenefited even the railroads in the long-run by forcing lower costs and greaterefficiency upon the roads, as well as leading to a long-run growth of freighttraffic.[29] [part0008.html#fn29]All in all, by the mid-1880s the railroads generally were in the position thatGabriel Kolko describes for the Eastern trunk cartelists by 1883:> By this time the Joint Executive Committee was merely an empty piety without> real power or meaning. Fink warned the railroad men that they would lose money> by their policies—which they very well realized—but he was unable to obtain> their cooperation. There were too many parties, too many potential areas of> friction, for successful control to come via voluntary agreements.[30]> [part0008.html#fn30]In 1884, the freight rate structure was in collapse, and the Trunk LineAssociation “did little more than stand by helplessly.” During that year,Charles Francis Adams, Jr., scion of the famous Massachusetts family, and one ofthe leaders of the Trunk Line Association, wrote that one of its meetings> struck me as a somewhat funereal gathering. Those comprising it were> manifestly at their wit’s end. ... Mr. Fink’s great and costly organization> was all in ruins. ... They reminded me of men in a boat in the swift water> above the rapids of Niagara.[31] [part0008.html#fn31]The trunk lines struggled to another agreement in late 1885, but it was again tocollapse the following year. And the railroad associations in other regions ofthe country were doing no better. Alfred Chandler’s conclusion is apt: “By 1884nearly all the railroad managers and most investors agreed that even the mostcarefully devised cartels were unable to control competition.”[32][part0008.html#fn32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0008.html#ft1] Since this book is not meant to be a history of late19th-century industry or of railroads, we do not discuss here fully the landgrants and other subsidies to railroads.

By granting subsidies, thegovernment diverted resources away from where consumers would have spent theirmoney (and hence valued more highly). See Murray Rothbard, Man, Economy, andState with Power and Market (Auburn, AL: Mises Institute 2009 [1962]), pp.946–53, 1040–41. That transcontinental railroads still would have been createdcan be seen through Hill’s Great Northern, built after buying the previouslysubsidized and bankrupt St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, which received a land grantfar smaller than the other transcontinentals.[10] [part0008.html#ft10] [Editor’s footnote] For more on Jay Cooke, theinflationist bent of the railroads, and the Panic of 1873, see Rothbard, “AHistory of Money and Banking,” pp. 148–56.

Since Morgan and August Belmont, the Rothschilds’ agent in New York,were generally allied, we may speculate that the Rothschilds’ rebuff to theNorthern Pacific bonds may have been part of a successful cabal to bring downJay Cooke and replace him with Morgan in the American banking firmament.

His father, Junius, was an American-born banker at theLondon branch of George Peabody & Co.[12] [part0008.html#ft12] It is difficult for the modern reader to comprehendthat, before the advent of the railroads, there was literally no way to moveover land apart from unsatisfactory local dirt roads. Hence, before the mid-19thcentury, transportation had to take place over water, and centers of populationand production had to be locally nearby.[13] [part0008.html#ft13] See Edward C. Kirkland, Industry Comes of Age:Business, Labor, and Public Policy, 1860–1897 (New York: Holt, Rinehart, andWinston, 1961), pp. 77–79.[14] [part0008.html#ft14] David M. Potter, “The Historical Development ofEastern-Southern Freight Relationships,” Law and Contemporary Problems (Summer1947): 420–23.[15] [part0008.html#ft15] [Editor’s footnote] Rothbard’s reasoning for why firmsprefer to engage in secret price discounts rather than publicly stated pricecuts is an illuminating explanation for why many prices may appear “stickier”than what they actually are. The historical price data which supposedly lookstable over long periods of time may not be the actual prices which transactionsare conducted at. Hidden price increases can also occur throughreclassifications of goods in pricing categories or charging for previously freeservices. In his class lectures on this point, Rothbard mentioned the work ofGeorge Stigler. See George Stigler and James Kindahl, The Behavior of IndustrialPrices (New York: NBER, 1970); Murray Rothbard, “The Railroading of the AmericanPeople” in The American Economy and the End of Laissez-Faire: 1870 to World WarII, 75:00 onward. Of course, prices are not perfectly flexible, but neither arethey as rigid as commonly believed.[16] [part0008.html#ft16] Kirkland, Industry Comes of Age, p. 84.[17] [part0008.html#ft17] [Editor’s footnote] Rothbard’s emphasis on pricing asa discovery process is a major theme in Austrian economics. The argument is thatcompetition, far from being accurately captured in the staid end state model ofperfect competition where buyers and sellers have no influence on prices andpossess perfect information, is actually better described as a dynamicinteractive process where rivalrous buyers and sellers have to appraise thepertinent market data, make speculative forecasts, and continually adjust theirbehavior. The market process, or the actions of entrepreneurs engaging ineconomic calculation to allocate scarce resources, is one of equilibrationrather than equilibrium. Markets are efficient and welfare enhancing even ifthey are not in perfect competition or general equilibrium. See Murray Rothbard,Man, Economy, and State, pp. 687–98, 720–39; Dominick T. Armentano, Antitrustand Monopoly: Anatomy of a Policy Failure, 2nd ed. (Oakland, CA: IndependentInstitute, 1990), pp. 13–48, and the sources of other Austrians cited therein.Rothbard later in his life did criticize the discovery procedure paradigm andpreferred to characterize entrepreneurs in the market as appraisers anduncertainty bearers instead of discoverers.

The economicsuffering of farmers in the late 19th century was overblown. In general, thereal price of freight for western farmers was roughly constant throughout thisperiod, and their terms of trade improved. Nor were they crippled by rising realinterest payments, in fact, interest rates were competitive, most farmers didnot take out mortgages, and mortgages that were taken out were short term andanticipated future deflation. Farmer anger was mainly due to their income risingless than other groups, and the increased competitiveness and changingenvironment they operated in.

The sustainable higher price of the cartel is evidence that theindustry overproduced, and the resources are more highly valued in otherindustries. The fact that time and time again, most cartels were not successfulis evidence that consumers valued the resources more highly in the cartelizedindustries than elsewhere.

If the railroads couldnot form successful cartels by voluntary action, then they would have to get thegovernment to do the job for them. Only government compulsion could sustain asuccessful cartel. As Fink put it in a letter as early as 1876, “Whether thiscooperation can be secured by voluntary action of the transportation companiesis doubtful. Governmental supervision and authority may be required to someextent to accomplish the object in view.”[1] [part0009.html#fn1]The railroad men were scarcely averse to calling in government to help solvetheir problems. As we have seen, the railroads had been hip deep in governmentsubsidy for many years, and particularly since the Civil War. Of the railroadpresidents in the 1870s, 80% held political jobs before, during, or after theirtenure. Specifically, of 53 railroad presidents in the 1870s, 28 held downpolitical jobs before or during their presidency, and 14 went into them afterthey left their railroad posts.[2] [part0009.html#fn2]Railroad regulation by the states was renewed after the Civil War, beginningwith the establishment of the Massachusetts Railroad Commission in 1869.Historians once thought that these state commissions had been put in by farmersto lower railroad rates, but then it was discovered that much of the agitationfor regulation came from groups of merchants in specific localities who weredisturbed at the pattern of railroad rates, especially the relative height intheir own localities. But far from the state commissions being at allanti-railroad, there is strong evidence that the railroads welcomed thecommissions and tried to use them to cartelize. Thus, Charles Francis Adams,Jr., of the patrician Adams family, chief architect of the Massachusetts law andChairman of the Railroad Commission, was scarcely a pariah in the railroadindustry. On the contrary, he went on to become a railroad pool administratorand then to be president of the Union Pacific. Moreover, Chauncey M. Depew,attorney for the New York Central, and William H. Vanderbilt, head of the NewYork Central, were early converts to the regulatory concept. As Depew laterwrote, he had become “convinced of their necessity ... for the protection ofboth the public and the railroads ...”[3] [part0009.html#fn3]Much has been made of the fact that the New England and New York commissions ofthe 1870s and 1880s were merely advisory, and could only hold public hearingsand encourage publicity, while Illinois and several other Midwestern states gavetheir commissions compulsory rate-setting powers. In practice, however, therewas little difference, and the “weak” state commissions were scarcely voluntary.As the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce reported in 1887, concerning theMassachusetts Commission, the railroad men obeyed the commission’s edictsbecause> self-interest admonishes them of the supreme folly of encouraging or engaging> in a losing contest with the forces of public opinion as concentrated and made> effective through the commission. It is not because the managers, directors,> or stockholders personally shrink from public criticism, but because back of> the commission stands the legislature and back of the legislature stands the> people ...[4] [part0009.html#fn4]But state regulation was proving too diverse and inefficient; in particular, itwas impossible to regulate the vitally important through rates, the rates onshipments that extended beyond the boundaries of any one state. And so, whilefarmers complained that state commissions were too friendly to railroads,railroad men began to turn to federal regulation, to federal cartelization, asthe solution. In the summer of 1877, John A. Wright, a director of thePennsylvania Railroad, wrote in the Railway World that the federal governmentmust “protect” the railroads from speculators competing ruthlessly toward“cutthroat” competition in railway rates. The federal government should not onlycontrol railroad investments and charters, but should fix freight and passengerrates, to be enforced “under penalty of criminal prosecution.”[5][part0009.html#fn5]By 1879, there was general agreement among railroad pool executives, includingAlbert Fink, that the federal government would have to step in to cartelizerailroad freight, for the pools could not succeed without governmentalenforcement. In the same year, Joseph Nimmo, Jr., head of the first governmentrailroad statistics department, reported that> At the present time railroad managers appear to be quite generally of the> opinion that the only practicable remedy for the evils of unjust and improper> discriminations, is to be found in a confederation of the railroads under> governmental sanction and control, the principle of the apportionment of> competitive traffic being recognized as a feature of such a confederation.[6]> [part0009.html#fn6]The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, regulating the railroads, was one of thefirst federal regulatory acts in American history. The Act began with a billintroduced in the House by Democratic Representative James H. Hopkins ofPittsburgh, in 1876 at the behest of a group of independent oil producers ofwestern Pennsylvania. The major provision of the Hopkins Bill was the outlawingof railroad rebates. Gabriel Kolko is the first historian to point out that themotives of the Pennsylvania oil men were not anti-railroad. Quite the contrary,they were pro-railroad and anti-Standard Oil. The oil men were peeved at thesuperior competition of Standard Oil and its ability to get rebates from therailroads. Bested at competition, they turned to use the federal government tohobble their successful competitor. Formed into the Petroleum Producers’ Unionthe following year, the Union championed the railroads and wailed that StandardOil was enslaving the giant New York Central, Pennsylvania, and B&O railroads.The railroads were delighted to form an alliance with the weaker oil men, inorder to rid themselves of the annoyingly competitive device of rebating; thismay be seen in the fact that the Hopkins Bill was apparently written by theattorney for the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad.[7] [part0009.html#fn7]The Pennsylvania oil men quickly organized a massive petition campaign for theHopkins Bill. Over 2,000 signatures of Pennsylvania oil producers and Pittsburghbusinessmen poured into the Congress agitating for the Hopkins proposal. TheHopkins Bill died in committee, but a similar bill, drafted by the PetroleumProducers’ Union, was introduced in early 1878, by Representative Lewis F.Watson of Pennsylvania. Rapidly, nearly 15,000 signatures on petitions pouredinto the House from Pennsylvania, attacking rebates and railroad rate“discrimination.” The Pennsylvania legislature, followed by Indiana and Nevada,sent similar resolutions to Congress during 1879.There began almost a decade of jockeying among railroads and other interests onthe precise form that federal railroad cartelization would take. The Watson Billwas reported out of the House Commerce Committee headed by Representative JohnH. Reagan of Texas, and the new Reagan Bill had been amended to outlaw railroadpooling. The Reagan Bill quickly passed the House in December, 1878.[8][part0009.html#fn8] While happy to see rebates outlawed, the railroads wantedthe pool agreements to be enforced rather than prohibited, and this prohibitionwas their major objection to the Reagan Bill. As Albert Fink testified beforethe Senate the following year, the railroads wanted to carry out the objectiveof the Reagan Bill. Fink approved the outlawing of rebates and the requirementto publicize rates (thus having a chilling effect on secret rebates); he alsourged a legalized and enforced pooling process, to be governed by a federalrailroad commission. Prefiguring the later provisions of the Interstate CommerceAct, Fink suggested the following clauses:> Section 3. That all competing railroad companies shall jointly establish a> tariff for all competing points.> > Section 4. That the tariff so established shall be submitted to a commission> of experts appointed by the Federal Government, and if they find that the> tariff is just and equitable and based upon correct commercial principles ...> then such tariff shall be approved, and shall become the law of the land,> until changed in the same manner by the same authority.> > Section 5. In cases where railroad companies cannot agree upon such tariffs,> or upon any other questions such as might lead to a war of rates between> railroad companies, the questions of disagreement shall be settled by> arbitration, the decision of the arbitrator to be enforced in the United> States Courts.[9] [part0009.html#fn9]The railroads preferred the Rice Bill of 1879 in the House, and the laterHenderson Bill, both written by railroad leader Charles Francis Adams. The bill,which called for a federal railroad commission to legalize and enforce railroadpooling, was endorsed by notables of the Pennsylvania and Erie railroads.The jockeying in Congress for the next several years was largely over thedetails of regulation, especially over the railroads’ desire to legalize poolingand to administer the statue by a regulatory commission. In testimony before theHouse Commerce Committee in 1884, railroad men were overwhelmingly in favor ofregulation, particularly if administered by an appointed commission. John P.Green, vice president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, declared that “a largemajority of the railroads in the United States would be delighted if a railroadcommission or any other power could make rates upon their traffic which wouldinsure them six per cent dividends, and I have no doubt, with such a guarantee,they would be very glad to come under the direct supervision and operation ofthe National Government.”[10] [part0009.html#fn10]Writing to Massachusetts Representative John D. Long on why the railroads wereso insistent on a federal commission, the shrewd Charles Francis Adams pointedout:> If you only get an efficient Board of Commissioners, they could work out of it> whatever was necessary. No matter what sort of bill you have, everything> depends upon the men who, so to speak, are inside of it, and who are to make> it work. In the hands of the right men, any bill would produce the desired> results.[11] [part0009.html#fn11]What those desired results were, and why federal regulation was needed, werespelled out in an 1884 article in the Chicago Railway Review by George R.Blanchard, head of the Erie. Clearly, such great pools as even the JointExecutive Committee could not succeed in imposing joint rates on the railroads.Therefore, what was needed was “a national railway commission to cooperate withand not oppose this recognized committee ... their cooperative trafficfederations [of the railroads] which are intended, within just limits, to secureuniformity, stability and impartiality among railways, their patrons and theStates, should be reinforced, ratified and legalized by an intelligent publicconviction.”[12] [part0009.html#fn12]In hearings before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee during 1885, dozensof prominent railroad men testified, and all but one strongly endorsed at leastthe principle of federal regulation. Almost all the railroad leaders favored aregulatory commission. In more detail, many called for legalizing of pools andfor the outlawing of rebates. In reporting out the regulatory bill by SenatorShelby M. Cullom of Illinois, the Committee pointed to its support among therailroad interests.In the meanwhile, a former vice president of the Erie Railroad wrote to theCommercial and Financial Chronicle criticizing traditional American adherence tolaissez-faire: “It has always been the fashion in this country to argue that theless government we have the better, and that this constitutes the main advantageof this country over Europe. But there are some things that the Government mustdo if society is to hold together”—in particular, assist the railroads throughregulation.[13] [part0009.html#fn13] In turn, free-market adherents werehorrified at the unanimity with which railroads and shippers alike were calling“for the same soothing syrup—legislative enactment.”[14] [part0009.html#fn14]By late 1886, the Senate had passed over the Cullom Bill and the House theReagan Bill. Both bills outlawed rebates; neither gave the federal governmentthe power to fix railroad rates directly. The railroads were in favor of theSenate bill because, unlike the Reagan Bill, it did not explicitly outlawprivate railroad pools and, more particularly, because it established a federalcommission to work its will in interpreting and enforcing a vague law, whereasthe Reagan Bill left enforcement solely to the courts. In a conference of thetwo houses, Reagan conceded all points to the Senate, except to maintain theprohibition on pooling. The country was given a law vague in all matters exceptoutlawry of rebates and of some rate discrimination in favor of long-haulfreight. The power of interpretation and enforcement in the courts was given toa five-man commission. The compromise bill, backed by the railroads, passed bothhouses overwhelmingly in January 1887 by a vote of 36 to 12 in the Senate, and219 to 41 in the House.[15] [part0009.html#fn15]The Chicago Inter-Ocean, a leading railroad magazine, summed up the railwaymen’s case for the Interstate Commerce Act shortly before its passage:> Perhaps the strongest argument that can be presented in favor of the passage> of this bill is found in the fact that many of the leading railway managers> admit the justice of its terms and join in the demand for its passage. ... The> irregularities that have gradually crept into [the railroads] ... got beyond> their capacity to manage. ... The effort to maintain rates was equally> unsuccessful. Then came the last resort—the pool—but that, too, proved> impotent. ... And now, acknowledging the inefficiency of their own weak> inventions ... the managers are content to leave the settlement of the whole> matter to the law-making power of the country ...[16] [part0009.html#fn16]With the law passed, “everything depend[ed],” as Adams had said, on who theInterstate Commerce Commissioners would be. The first Commission, in particular,would set the pattern for the future with its interpretations and rulings. Wouldthe railroads, or the shippers, or the farmers, control this commission? Or,more precisely, whom would President Grover Cleveland appoint?The United States was, politically, in the midst of a new era: in 1884 theDemocratic Party had, in the person of Grover Cleveland, captured the presidencyfor the first time since the Civil War. From now until the late 1890s, theUnited States would be a genuine two-party country once again, with powershifting easily from one party to the other. We have mentioned above that, inthe Panic of 1873, J.P. Morgan had succeeded the fallen Jay Cooke as thenation’s premier investment banker. And since the railroads were the onlygenuine big business in these decades, this meant the successor as the leadingrailroad financier. But while Jay Cooke had been a Republican, J.P. Morgan was aDemocrat. If we consider that August Belmont, U.S. representative of thepowerful European banking house of Rothschild, was treasurer of the nationalDemocratic Party for many years, we can see that such financial powers as Morganand Belmont wielded enormous influence over the personnel and the policies ofthe Democratic Party.[17] [part0009.html#fn17]Before the Civil War, the Democratic Party had been the laissez-faire, minimalgovernment party in America. This continued to be the case, although not quiteas strongly. But the party was now vulnerable, for if Morgan, Belmont, andfinanciers or railroad men in their ambit should begin to shift to a statistposition in one or more areas, the Democratic Party was likely to follow. Andthis is in fact what happened.J.P. Morgan had become the foremost sponsor of railroad pools, and his as wellas other railroads had now endorsed the ICC as an instrument of imposedcartelization. The new President, Grover Cleveland, was also generally in favorof laissez-faire, but he had long been in the railroad ambit. When he ran forGovernor of New York in 1882, he was known, with considerable justice, as a“railroad attorney” in Buffalo. Cleveland had been an attorney for severalrailroads, including the New York Central. His pro-railroad appointments to theNew York Railroad Commission were consistent with this image.[18][part0009.html#fn18] Cleveland also had a close long-time relationship with J.P.Morgan. During his administration as President, he frequently consulted withboth Morgan and Belmont Jr., and Cleveland’s old law partner, Francis LyndeStetson, later became the attorney for J.P. Morgan and Co. and one of the mostimportant counsellors in the Morgan circle.[19] [part0009.html#fn19]The railroad men therefore regarded Cleveland as safe, and they turned out to beright. Cleveland did not, of course, veto the Interstate Commerce Act. Hisappointments to the ICC were even more revealing. At the urging of SenatorCullom, Cleveland chose as chairman the distinguished jurist, Thomas McIntyreCooley. A proponent of strict construction and laissez-faire, Cooleyunfortunately chose the railroad industry to make his most conspicuous exceptionto this general rule. This choice was perhaps not unconnected with his acceptingemployment, from 1882 on, as administrator and arbitrator in Albert Fink’s JointExecutive Committee railroad pool. In addition, Cooley served since 1885 as areceiver for the Wabash Railroad. As a result of accepting these posts, Cooleyhad shifted by 1887 to favoring government legalization and control of poolingthrough a federal commission.Of the four other commissioners, two were leading railroad men. AugustusSchoonmaker had been associated with Cleveland in New York politics, and thenhad become a railroad attorney; and Aldace F. Walker was a veteran railroad manwho was to resign after two years on the ICC to become head of the majorrailroad rates association, and eventually to be chairman of the board of theAtchison, Topeka & Santa Fe. The other two members were hack Democraticpoliticians, one of whom had already been a state railroad commissioner inAlabama. It was no wonder that the Railway Review hailed the appointments:“Fortunately, its present membership is not made up of the stuff that is liableto shrink from doing what it conceives to be its duty ...”[20][part0009.html#fn20]The Interstate Commerce Commission quickly moved in the direction desired by therailroads. On the one hand, the ICC allowed the railroads themselves to suspendthe provision prohibiting discrimination against short-haul rates when it wasadvantageous for them to be higher, thereby giving the ICC sanction to theirpractices. Aldace Walker wrote that this policy was “capable of very generalapplication ... and it is a fact that as a prevention of rate wars anddestructive competition it is already recognized by intelligent railroad men asbetter than the pool.”[21] [part0009.html#fn21] On the other hand, the railroadmen were anxious to have the ICC follow strictly the prohibition of rebates toshippers, and the ICC eagerly complied. Railroad leaders kept a vigilant eye onviolations of the new law by their competitors and enthusiastically turned theminto the authorities. As Charles Francis Adams, Jr., now president of the UnionPacific, declared: “... we would welcome the rigid and literal enforcement ofevery provision of the interstate commerce act.”[22] [part0009.html#fn22]At first, the railroads, under the friendly regime of the ICC, were able toraise rates, but soon, by the end of 1887, the dreaded rebates began again as afew railroads decided to compete vigorously once more. The railroads decided totry to bring pools in by the back door. While pools were technically outlawed,voluntary rate associations, which simply fixed rates without allocatingfreights and markets, were still legal. Indeed, Professor George Hilton concurswith pro-railroad opinion at the time that the language of the InterstateCommerce Act, taken from the original Cullom Bill, “almost compels” collusiveratemaking on the part of the railroads.[23] [part0009.html#fn23]The ICC was therefore in keeping with the law when, to the delight of therailroads, it decided to give its sanction and imprimatur to the freight ratesworked out by the railroad rate associations—in short, to use the federalgovernment to ratify rates decided upon by private railroad cartels. Despite theofficial outlawry of pools, therefore, the ICC was to serve as a powerfulinstrument of railroad cartels.It is no wonder that, very soon after its inception, the Interstate Commerce Actand the ICC were lauded by the railway men, while the merchants’ and farmers’groups who had high hopes for the ICC quickly came to call for its repeal. Thus,during 1890, numerous merchants and farmers groups called for repeal of theoutlawry of pro-long haul discrimination, while the Detroit and IndianapolisBoards of Trade went so far as to call for outright repeal of the InterstateCommerce Act because it protected railroads and raised railway rates.[24][part0009.html#fn24]But if the ICC looked with favor at cartel rates fixed by rate associations, ithad no power to fix or enforce them. As competition resumed and freight ratesfell further, the presidents of the leading Western roads were called to NewYork by the tireless J.P. Morgan to seek ways of maintaining freight rates andenforcing violations of the anti-rebate law. The railroad men met with the ICCcommissioners in 1889, and the ICC encouraged the railroads to form what wouldvirtually be a pool agreement. As a result, 22 roads signed an agreement to keepfreight rates from falling; and, while no shares of freight were formallyallocated between the roads, thus keeping narrowly within the letter of the law,the agreement authorized the railroads to take such steps as may be necessaryand legal “to secure to each Company its due share of the competitivetraffic.”[25] [part0009.html#fn25] The pool, with its agreement to rationbusiness and thereby allow a raise in rates, was back in all but name. And thistime the ICC was there to help enforce it.The new cartel organization called itself the “Inter-State Commerce RailwayAssociation,” and it avowed that its purpose was “to exercise their power andinfluence in the maintenance of rates and the enforcement of all the provisionsof the Inter-State Law.” It was, in short, merely altruistically interested inlaw enforcement! The Association pledged itself to enforce the agreement bynotifying the ICC of any violation of law. And, to top matters off, and tounderscore the incestuous relationship the new Association had with the ICC,Aldace Walker resigned as a member of the ICC to become chairman of the neworganization. Gabriel Kolko aptly calls the Association, “in fact nothing morethan a massive railway effort to interpret and enforce, with Commissionsanction, the Act of 1887.”[26] [part0009.html#fn26]The presidents of the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads, therepresentative of the Northwest Railroad Board, and Charles Francis Adams, Jr.,were all enthusiastic about the agreement. In imitation, ten major Eastern linessigned a similar agreement in February, appointing the ubiquitous cartelistAlbert Fink as its commissioner. Again, the sanctimonious purpose was “to aid inthe enforcement of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Law,” and to informon all violations to the Commission.[27] [part0009.html#fn27]But even with ICC sanction, the winds of competition proved far too great forthe railroad cartels. By the spring of 1889, vehement rate wars in the West hadwrecked the Association. Repeated attempts to establish rate associations in theSouthwest and to reconstitute the one in the West continued to fail, despiteJ.P. Morgan’s best efforts and the ICC endorsement. Rates continued to fall,sparked by secret competitive rebates, throughout the 1890s. The railroadscontinued to try to form and reconstitute rate associations, but all to noavail. In late 1895, 31 major Eastern roads set up the Joint TrafficAssociation, along almost the same lines as the defunct Inter-State CommerceRailway Association. The U.S. Supreme Court killed the association in October1898 by calling such agreements illegal pools, following a similar decision theprevious year. But it should be noted that the Association had foundered on therock of competition and rate-cutting before the court’s decision wasannounced.[28] [part0009.html#fn28]Throughout the 1890s, the railroads agitated for what were called “legalizedpools,” but were actually pools that would be legally enforceable. In billssponsored or written by railroads and submitted to Congress, railroad poolswould fix rates, and then the ICC would ratify and enforce them. As the attorneyfor the B&O, who wrote one of the bills, declared: “we say unhesitatingly we arenot afraid for one instant of the intervention of the Commission. We do not wantan agreement to go into effect without their approval ...” The railroad point ofview was put cogently by A.B. Stickney, president of the Minnesota &Northwestern Railroad, in a book written in 1891:> For a quarter of a century they [the railroads] have been attempting, by> agreements between themselves, to make and maintain uniform and stable rates.> But as such contracts are not recognized as binding by the law, they have> rested entirely on the good faith of each company, and to a great extent upon> the capacity as well as good faith of each of the traffic officials and> employees. In the past they have not been efficacious, and ... it is too much> to hope for any sufficient protection to the rights of owners growing out of> such agreements. ... Their alternative protection is the strong arm of the> law. Let the law name the rates, and let the law maintain and protect their> integrity.[29] [part0009.html#fn29]But despite the enthusiastic support of the ICC, Congress stubbornly refused topass any such legislation. Now, after 1898, even the rate association route wasdeclared illegal by the courts. As a result, railroad and ICC pressure onCongress for legalized pools intensified still further.2. STRENGTHENING THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSIONAnd so, by the turn of the century, the railroad leaders had realized that theexisting Interstate Commerce Act was not sufficiently powerful to act as asuccessful cartelizer of the railroad industry. For the first decade of the 20thcentury, as Hilton states, “the history of the statutory authority of the ICC isbest interpreted as an effort to convert the Act of 1887 into an effectivecartelizing statute.”[30] [part0009.html#fn30]To aid in this effort, the railroad men were fortunate in the man who succeededthe pro-railroad Shelby M. Cullom in 1899 as chairman of the Senate InterstateCommerce Committee. He was the even more pro-railroad and more vigorous StephenBenton Elkins of West Virginia, who quickly became the most importantCongressional influence on railroad legislation. Elkins had always had his eyeon the main chance. During the 1870s he had become the largest landowner in NewMexico by shrewd use of his post as U.S. District Attorney; he then wasfortunate enough to marry the daughter of Henry G. Davis, a coal and railroadtycoon in West Virginia. Through this marriage, Elkins became the largest mineowner in the Atlantic area; he and his father-in-law also controlled the WestVirginia Central and Pittsburgh Railroad. In short, Elkins’ passion for theinterests of the railroads was not unconnected with his own status as railroadowner.[31] [part0009.html#fn31]The railroad cartelists were also fortunate in the sudden accession to thepresidency of the United States of Theodore Roosevelt, the preeminent politicalsymbol of Progressivism whose long political career was always close to theHouse of Morgan.[32] [part0009.html#fn32] By the end of the 1890s, Morgan hadgained far more predominance in the railroad industry than he had ever hadbefore, and his drive for cartelization—in general industry as well asrailroads—had intensified. It is no wonder that Morgan’s ally Roosevelt wouldcome to be labelled as the railroad men’s “best friend.”[33][part0009.html#fn33]The first fruit of the new cartelizing drive was the Progressive ElkinsAnti-Rebating Act of 1903. Rebates had been outlawed in the Act of 1887, butthis mighty instrument of intense competition had continued to flourish, eventhough hidden, in the form of such devices as false classification andunderestimating the weights of freight. Alexander J. Cassatt, president of theMorgan-associated Pennsylvania Railroad since 1899, had long been dedicated tocartels and “stabilization.” His attempt to end Pennsylvania rebates to thepowerful Carnegie Steel Co. led to a mighty battle in which Andrew Carnegie andGeorge Jay Gould threatened to build parallel railroads, while Morgan counteredwith a powerful attempt at monopoly in the steel industry known as United StatesSteel.[34] [part0009.html#fn34] Cassatt did not hesitate to turn to the seculararm by having his general counsel, James A. Logan, write the Elkins Bill in 1901to crack down on rebating. Logan told a press conference that if his bill shouldpass, the railroads would “no longer be subject to the dictation of the greatshippers as to rates and facilities.”[35] [part0009.html#fn35] The originalElkins Bill as it passed the Senate also achieved the long-standing railroadobjective of legalizing pooling; while the final compromise bill did notofficially legalize pools, it did the equivalent by declaring rates jointlyarrived at by railroads to be legal, and providing that any joint rate filedwith the ICC “shall be conclusively deemed to be the legal rate, and anydeparture from such rate, or any offer to depart therefrom to be anoffense ...”[36] [part0009.html#fn36] The Elkins Act also made corporations aswell as individuals liable for violations and provided that both the giver andreceiver of rebates could be prosecuted. Thus, not only did the Elkins Act of1903 greatly strengthen the prohibition of rebates, but it restored thelegalization of associated rates that the Supreme Court had knocked down ahalf-decade before.The railroads exulted at the passage of the Elkins Act which passed unanimouslyin the Senate and with virtually no opposition in the House. The RailroadGazette declared that the law should have been passed five years earlier, andgloated that “all that will be asked of the Commissioners by the public will bethat they go ahead and catch every law-breaking rate-cutter in the country.”[37][part0009.html#fn37]Various merchant and shipper groups were not satisfied with the existing law,and they agitated after 1903 for outright rate-fixing powers to be given to theICC. They were opposed by other shippers, however, including the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, which reversed itself on the issue. As a result ofthis split, and of railroad opposition, such bills as the Esch-Townsend Billwere ultimately defeated in Congress.[38] [part0009.html#fn38]A different law, the Hepburn Act, written in the councils of the Rooseveltadministration, passed Congress almost unanimously in 1906. As Kolko points out,historians have made a great to-do about the Hepburn Act as an allegedlycontroversial “reform” measure directed against the railroads while overlookingthe fact (a) that the controversies were all minor, and (b) that everyone,especially including the railroads, accepted the principles of the bill andquibbled only over details. An examination of the Hepburn Act reveals why therailroads and railroad journals praised the law. Perhaps most importantly, theHepburn Act strengthened the Elkins Act against rebating. For one thing, itextended the law to cover express and sleeping-car railroads, private-car lines,and pipe-lines, thus extending the cartel by bringing competing forms oftransportation under the same regulation. Secondly, the Hepburn Act outlawedrailroads transporting products which they owned themselves, a measure aimed atcompeting “industrial roads,” such as anthracite railroads, which owned coalmines.[39] [part0009.html#fn39] Third, it required 30 days’ notice for ratechanges, which slowed down competitive rate cutting, and rebate penalties werestiffened, with fines equaling three times the value of the rebate, and apossible penalty of two years imprisonment was imposed for violating the law.Fourth, the railroad cartel was expanded by outlawing free passes by railroadsto their customers, as well as various other free services to shippers. This, ofcourse, was the equivalent of compulsory raising of rates by outlawing forms ofprice-cutting. Fifth, if rates arrived at by railroads were challenged byshippers, the ICC had the right to set its own maximum rates, if it found thoserates not to be “just, fair, and reasonable.” The ICC’s rulings would be subjectto review by the courts, and even though these were to be maximum rates, givingthem the force of law made collusion between the railroads much easier, andhence strengthened the cartels.[40] [part0009.html#fn40]Particularly enthusiastic about the Hepburn Act was A.J. Cassatt, head of thePennsylvania Railroad, who proclaimed his agreement with Roosevelt’s position.The Pennsylvania pointed out, in its 1906 Annual Report, that its aim ofachieving the end of rebating having been achieved with the Hepburn Act, and“the maintenance of tariff rates [having] been practically secured,” it could goahead and sell the stock it had purchased in its competitors.[41][part0009.html#fn41] G.J. Grammar of the New York Central exulted in thecompulsory elimination of the free passes and services. Key railroad leaderssuch as John W. Midgley (a veteran pool organizer) and Samuel Spencer wereanxious to bring private-car railroad lines under regulation. The Railway andEngineering Review crowed over the abolition of the industrial railroads. E.H.Harriman, second only to Morgan in controlling railroads, favored the HepburnAct. And, upon its passage, George W. Perkins, partner of J.P. Morgan & Co.,wrote to Morgan that the new law “is going to work out for the ultimate andgreat good of the railroads. There is no question but that rebating has beendealt a death blow.”[42] [part0009.html#fn42]The railroads had been so exercised about the rebating problem that theexecutives of virtually all of the Western roads had met in December 1905, toconsider steps to combat the practice. They decided to inform the ICC of allviolations of the law.The Hepburn Act was drawn up by Attorney-General William H. Moody. PresidentRoosevelt had consulted with several railroad leaders, including Cassatt,Midgley, and Spencer. Roosevelt had been converted to the railroad cause, and tothe desirability of railroad pools, by his Secretary of the Navy Paul Morton,formerly vice president of the Morgan-controlled Atchison, Topeka & Santa FeRailroad.[43] [part0009.html#fn43]In his December, 1905 message to Congress, Roosevelt explained his call forrailroad regulation in terms of restricting railroad competition, of protecting“good” as against “bad” (that is, particularly vigorous) competitors:> I believe that on the whole our railroads have done well and not ill; but the> railroad men who wish to do well should not be exposed to competition with> those who have no such desire, and the only way to secure this end is to give> some Government tribunal the power to see that justice is done by the> unwilling exactly as it is gladly done by the willing. Moreover, if some> Government body is given increased power the effect will be to furnish> authoritative answer on behalf of the railroad whenever irrational clamor> against it is raised, or whenever charges made against it are disproved.[44]> [part0009.html#fn44]Contemplating the growing drive for what would become the Hepburn Act, the WallStreet Journal keenly noted the enthusiasm by the railroad men as well as thegrowing general business interest in their own regulation:> Nothing is more noteworthy than the fact that President Roosevelt’s> recommendation in favor of government regulation of railroad rates and> Commissioner Garfield’s recommendation in favor of federal control of> interstate companies have met with so much favor among managers of railroads> and industrial companies. It is not meant by this that much opposition has not> developed, for it has ...> > The fact is that many of the railroad men and corporate managers are known to> be in favor of these measures, and this is of vast significance. In the end it> is probable that all of the corporations will find that a reasonable system of> federal regulation is to their interest. ... It is known that some of the> foremost railroad men of the country are at this time at work in harmony with> the President for the enactment of a law providing for federal regulation of> rates which shall be equitable both to the railroads and to the public.[45]> [part0009.html#fn45]One consequence of the Hepburn Act indicates, contrary to accepted propaganda,whom the act really injured and whom it benefited. As soon as the act waspassed, the New York Central happily complied by abolishing free storagefacilities for New York flour merchants, the Chicago and Eastern IllinoisRailroad inaugurated charges for switching, and free car service and loading inPhiladelphia was abolished. The Railway World happily reported that:> notwithstanding the fears of many that railroads would be hurt by the> operation of the law, no complaint has been heard from railroad men against> its general provisions. On the contrary, the complaints are coming from the> shippers, who were supposed to be the chief beneficiaries of the law.[46]> [part0009.html#fn46]In 1910, Congress passed the Mann-Elkins Act completing the trilogy ofcartelizing railroad acts passed during the first decade of the 20th century.The original bill of the Taft administration would have legalized railroadagreements to fix freight rates—a measure that the railroads had long yearnedfor. The roads could not get this provision through Congress, and they had toaccept the clause that the ICC might suspend and review railroad rate changes.In point of fact, the railroads welcomed governmental review and approval ofrates provided this power were used primarily to prevent rate reductions ratherthan increases. To insure this, the railroads welcomed the achievement of an olddemand in the Mann-Elkins Act: the creation of a new, special Federal Court ofCommerce with the power to review all ICC rate decisions on appeal. It wasexpected by everyone that the new Commerce Court would be solidly pro-railroad,and so it proved to be. The chairman of the Commerce Court was the previouschairman of the ICC, Martin A. Knapp, who had long opposed competition inrailroads and favored legalized pooling enforced by the government, and he nowreaffirmed this stand, as well as calling for higher railroad rates.[47][part0009.html#fn47]Also a force for cartelization was another provision of Mann-Elkins,reestablishing the original prohibition, in the Interstate Commerce Act, of ratediscrimination for long-haul over short-haul traffic—a clause that had beennullified in the Supreme Court’s Alabama Midland Railway decision in 1897. Byrestoring this prohibition, Congress strengthened railroad cartels by preventingcompetitive rate reductions for long-haul traffic.Professor Hilton trenchantly sums up the effect of the Mann-Elkins and otheracts:> The investigation and suspension procedures established in 1910 and recognized> for decades, were a powerful inhibition to promiscuous rate reduction, and the> Mann-Elkins Act’s revision in Section 4 of the Act of 1887 restored its> effectiveness against the practice of charging more for a shorter haul than> for a longer haul. Without an effective Section 4, the Commission was unable> to put down rate wars in which a railroad cut rates between points which it> served in rivalry to parallel railroads below the level of rates to> intermediate points.> > Basically, what the legislation of 1903, 1906, and 1910 did was rectify the> adverse judicial decisions of the 1890s and otherwise patch up the> Commission’s statutory body of authority so that it could accomplish what> Congress had set out to do in 1887: stabilize the railroad cartels without> pooling.[48] [part0009.html#fn48]But the railroads were getting worried about the performance of their creation,the ICC, as witness their eagerness to place as many rate-setting powers aspossible in the Commerce Court. For the organized shippers, with their interestin lower rates, were growing in political strength. They had managed to blockimportant pro-railroad Taft administration provisions in Congress, and they grewin influence after 1910. In consequence, the ICC repeatedly rejected rateincreases urged by the railroads after 1910, and, after the Supreme Courtemasculated the powers of the Commerce Court in 1912, the shippers persuadedCongress to abolish the latter the following year.[49] [part0009.html#fn49]But despite their uneasiness at shipper influence on the ICC, for the nation’srailroads there was no turning back. They were strongly committed to federalgovernment regulation, and the stronger the better.[50] [part0009.html#fn50] Forone thing, federal regulation was bound to be more uniform, and therefore moreeffective in imposing a nationwide cartel, than state regulation, and probablyit would be more enthusiastically pro-cartel. In the summer of 1914, the newlyformed Railroad Executives’ Advisory Committee, including most of the nation’srailroads and headed by Frank Trumbull of the Chesapeake & Ohio, called forcomprehensive federal control of the country’s railroads along the lines offederal control of the banks in the new Federal Reserve Act.[51][part0009.html#fn51] E.P. Ripley, president of the Santa Fe Railroad, calledexplicitly for a partnership between the federal government and the railroads.In return for control over rates, the government would guarantee all railroads afixed minimum rate of profit. This, opined Ripley, “would do away with theenormous wastes of the competitive system ...”[52] [part0009.html#fn52] DanielWillard, head of the Baltimore & Ohio, called for speeding up the process offederalizing railroad regulation, and likened this need to the recent federalregulation embodied in the Federal Reserve and Federal Trade Commission acts.The shippers had managed to block railroad rate increases before the ICC in 1910by arguing for greater “efficiency” and “scientific management” on the part ofthe railroads. The railroad leaders, in their subsequent agitation for enlargedand comprehensive federal regulation, turned the tables by linking the typicallyprogressive concept of “efficiency” with imposing uniformity and eliminating“competitive waste.” More specifically, this would come through cooperative,i.e., cartel-like, reductions in service and in railroad traffic, as well asquota allocations of freight, all in the name of efficient elimination of waste.The role of the federal government was to be as supervisor and enforcer of thiscartelizing process. All this was supposed to require, and indeed was meant asthe prop for, higher railroad rates.[53] [part0009.html#fn53]All in all, Fairfax Harrison, president of the Chicago, Indianapolis &Louisville Railroad, spoke for the railroad leaders when he declared that theICC was necessary to assure general increases in rates when profits might below, and thereby to prop up and increase railway earnings. This would be farbetter than free competition or the vagaries of state regulation. TrumpetedHarrison: “The day of the Manchester school and laissez faire is gone. ...Personally, I do not repine at the change ...”[54] [part0009.html#fn54]In response, the Republican platform of 1916 duly called for total federalcontrol of railroad regulation. For their part, the Democrats were blazing thesame path through the views and actions of President Woodrow Wilson. OnSeptember 10, 1914, Wilson wrote to Trumbull that, in view of declining railroadearnings, the railroads must be “helped in every possible way, whether byprivate co-operative effort or by the action, wherever feasible, of governmentalagencies ...”[55] [part0009.html#fn55] The Railway World reported massivebusiness approval of Wilson’s sentiments, and the Railway Business Associationpassed a resolution hailing the President. J.P. Morgan, Jr. wrote to Wilsonexpressing his gratitude for the Trumbull letter.Moreover, in response to a request from Trumbull, President Wilson, in hisDecember 1915 message to Congress, urged an inquiry into a comprehensivegrappling with the nation’s railroad problem. Trumbull enthusiastically wiredWilson that “I am confident that you will do for the railroads of this countryas much as you have already done for the banks.”[56] [part0009.html#fn56] At thesubsequent hearings of the Congressional Joint Committee headed by SenatorFrancis G. Newlands, established in July 1916, the major railroad position wasdelivered by Alfred P. Thom, chief counsel of the Railroad Executives’ AdvisoryCommittee. Thom not only called for exclusive federal regulation of therailroads, but also for their protection. He urged the model of the FederalReserve System, with regional ICC’s, ICC setting of minimum as well as maximumrates, and the compulsory federal incorporation of all railroads as well asexclusive federal regulation of railroad security issues.President Wilson called for strengthening of the ICC along similar lines inAugust 1916—as well as advocating higher rates—and repeated his request in hisDecember message to Congress. As we shall see below, the coming of America’sentry into World War I in April 1917 paved the way for the culmination of this,as well as other aspects of the progressives’ cartelizing programs for Americanindustry. During the war, the railroad cartelists, viewing the “nationalization”of their industry, couldn’t have been happier.[57] [part0009.html#fn57]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0009.html#ft1] Gilchrist, “Albert Fink and the Pooling System,” pp.32–33.[2] [part0009.html#ft2] Ruth Crandall, “American Railroad Presidents in the1870’s: Their Backgrounds and Careers,” Explorations in Entrepreneurial History(July 15, 1950), p. 295.

Railroad tycoon ThomasScott’s fledging empire, the Texas & Pacific and the Pennsylvania, was involvedin heated conflicts with other large railroad giants in the 1870s. The formerwas wrestling with Collis P. Huntington’s Central Pacific for control oftransportation from California to the South, and the latter against the Erie andNew York Central for Standard Oil’s lucrative oil shipments. Scott wantedfederal subsidies to strengthen the Texas & Pacific in order to compete withHuntington. John Reagan of Texas was eager to help Scott in order to get atranscontinental railroad in his congressional district, a goal he long desired.This was mixed in with the election of Rutherford B. Hayes and the Compromise of1877, in which the Republicans were able to offer vague promises to SouthernDemocrats—including John Reagan—in the form of subsidies to the Texas & Pacificin return for their admittance for the electoral commission to count thedisputed electoral ballots for Hayes. After the election the Republicansreneged, so Scott received no federal subsidies, and Reagan no transcontinentalrailroad. The subsequent Reagan Bill, which outlawed pooling and interstaterebates to shippers and discrimination, was designed to strengthen Scott’sempire and hamper its rivals connected with Standard’s de facto railroad cartel.The prohibition of rebates and rate discrimination applied only to interstatetrade, shrewdly designed to cripple the Pennsylvania’s competitors. Moreover,the Texas & Pacific opposed price discrimination in favor of governmentinvolvement with rate setting.

That the Erie and New York Central opposed the Reagan bill because itwould weaken their position relative to the Pennsylvania, or that the UnionPacific, Central Pacific, and Southern Pacific were opposed to a rivaltranscontinental railroad, is not surprising. In addition, some railroadsopposed the ICC because they were not fully satisfied with the results, and itis not a stretch to assume that since some railroads thrived at breaking rateagreements and cartels, others opposed the measure as well.[16] [part0009.html#ft16] January 2, 1887.

SeeRobert L. Bradley, Jr. and Roger Donway, “Reconsidering Gabriel Kolko: AHalf-Century Perspective,” Independent Review (Spring 2013): 570–71, 573.

See also Murray Rothbard, The Ethicsof Liberty (New York: New York University Press, 2002 [1982]), pp. 133–48.Therefore, the drive for railroads to get the government to enforce their cartelarrangements does constitute as an intervention.[30] [part0009.html#ft30] Hilton, “Consistency of the Interstate Commerce Act,”p. 110.[31] [part0009.html#ft31] Kolko, Railroads and Regulation, pp. 90–91.[32] [part0009.html#ft32] For more on the Roosevelt-Morgan connection, seeChapter 7 below, pp. 203–28.[33] [part0009.html#ft33] Kolko, Railroads and Regulation, p. 155.[34] [part0009.html#ft34] ([Editor’s remarks] Gabriel Kolko, The Triumph ofConservatism (Glencoe, IL: The Free Press, 1963), p. 32.)

The importance of the Elkins Act, which has been rather neglectedby historians, is underscored by George Hilton as revealing “the overallframework of regulation” of the railroads. George W. Hilton, “Review of AlbroMartin, Enterprise Denied,” Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science(Autumn 1972): 629. ([Editor’s remarks] The above article is a trenchantcritique of Albro Martin’s Enterprise Denied, a book on railroads whichcriticized parts of Kolko’s thesis. Rothbard earlier praised the article in“Recommended Reading,” Libertarian Forum (December, 1972): 6. See Albro Martin,Enterprise Denied: The Origins of the Decline of the American Railroads,1897–1917 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1971). However, as shown below,Rothbard does agree with some aspects of Martin’s thesis, such as that after1910 the railroads drowned under the ICC’s regulations.) Even Chandler, who isgenerally unsympathetic to the cartelizing interpretation of railroadlegislation, concedes that the railroads overwhelmingly supported the ElkinsAct, although he fails to realize that the Act strengthened the ICC andlegalized joint railroad rates.

There has been much discussion over the railroad oppositionto regulation in 1904 and 1905. Some have argued, contra Kolko, that therailroads were unanimously opposed to any new regulation. See Martin, EnterpriseDenied, pp. 111–14; Richard H.K. Vietor, “Businessmen and the Political Economy:The Railroad Rate Controversy of 1905,” Journal of American History (June,1977): 50–53. However, Kolko argued that the railroad opposition, especially inthe Senate Committee meetings, was mainly directed against the Esch-TownsendBill, which allowed the ICC to fix definite rates, and in speeches and railroadjournals they were more sympathetic to other types of regulation. Kolko,Railroads and Regulation, pp. 117–44.[39] [part0009.html#ft39] The Railway and Engineering Review spoke for mostrailroad opinion in hailing the provision of the new law outlawing industrialrailroads: “... the ‘Industrial Roads’ will go out of business.

As Kolko points out, the Supreme Court’s decisions of the late 1890s,striking down various rate regulations and refusing to sanction cartelagreements, were not, as most historians have believed, “pro-railroad”decisions. On the contrary, they were examples of the Court clashing with therailroads.

AMERICA’S INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONIn the decades after the Civil War and until the end of the 19th century,America experienced its veritable Industrial Revolution. In an explosion ofindustrialization, the United States transformed from a predominantlyagricultural into an industrial country. In the process, output and livingstandards soared for a rapidly increasing population. The enormous expansion ofproduction took place through the factory system which, in these decades,replaced the small artisan and craftsman as the predominant form of industrialproduction. Formerly, the craftsmen typically worked at home on his own tools,with his raw materials sometimes financed by his wholesale merchant customer(“the putting out” or “domestic” system). Now, a capitalist employer, from hisown or from his partner’s savings, built or purchased buildings, machines, andraw material, and hired a number of employees to work on these materials at acentral location. It proved to be efficient in most industries to help increasethe scale and size of the factories and firms as markets for the increasedproduction expanded throughout the nation.There are many indices that reveal the extent of the explosion of production andindustrialization in the three decades after the Civil War. Thus, in “real”terms (in constant 1879 dollars), total commodity output increased bythree-and-a-half-fold from 1869 to 1899. Agricultural output, in those years,more than doubled, construction increased 2 1/2 times. Manufacturing output, incontrast, rose almost six-fold in that period, while mining increasedeight-fold. In more specific types of production, increases were even morespectacular, led by the blossoming iron and steel industry. Thus, in 1865, 930thousand short tons of pig iron were shipped in the United States; in 1899, thefigure had risen sixteen-fold to 15.25 million tons. And steel ingots andcastings produced, rose five-hundred- fold, from 20 thousand long tons in 1867to 10.6 million long tons in 1899. Structural iron and steel productionincreased ten-fold, cotton textiles over five-fold, and rails produced rosenearly six-fold. Bituminous coal output rose seventeen-fold from 1865 to 1900,while crude oil production rose twenty-six-fold.Output per head, and consequently living standards, also rose sharply in thisperiod, despite the large increase in the nation’s population. Commodity outputper capita nearly doubled in this period, and Gross National Product per capitain constant 1929 prices rose by 80% in the 20 years from 1871 to 1891. In termsof real wages, the average daily wage in all industry rose by 13% from 1865 to1891, while the cost of living fell on the average of 31% in the same period.The average daily real wages (corrected for price changes) increased by 64%.Then, when we consider that average hours worked dropped from 11 to 10 hours aday in this period, we should add 10% to the average real wage.So spectacular was the expansion of products that it outstripped the increase inthe money supply during this period, so that, mirabile dictu, overall pricesfell steadily by 2 1/2% per year from 1870 to 1890.[1] [part0010.html#fn1]Manufacturing, however, only caught up to the capital advances of railroads bythe 1890s. Before then, industrial firms were still largely individualproprietorships or partnerships, with the corporate form confined to railroadsand banks. Despite the fact that savings per capita grew rapidly during the1870s and 1880s, the size of firms was not large enough for most of this periodto require a shift from the proprietorship or partnership to the corporate form.As a result, firms were financed largely by the savings of partners or informaldebts from friends or relatives. Until the 1890s, therefore, the New York StockExchange and other security markets were confined to government bonds, railroadstocks and bonds, and bank stocks.As a result, the crucial role of investment banks, which underwrote and floatedthe sale of securities, was largely confined to government bonds and railroadsecurities until the mid-1890s. Hence, the almost exclusive concern of theHouses of Cooke and Morgan for governments and railroads. By the 1890s, however,J.P. Morgan led the way in organizing large-scale industrial corporations andthen underwriting and controlling issues of their securities. Thus, Morganorganized the General Electric Company, in the vital new field of electricmachinery and lighting, in 1892. On the other hand, while the passing ofownership from the great inventor Thomas Edison to the enlarged Morgan Companysymbolized future trends in American industry, the equally great inventor GeorgeWestinghouse stubbornly refused to merge with GE in the mid-1890s. The newlyformed Westinghouse Company continued to live on the savings and plowed-backprofits of George Westinghouse and his fellow stockholders and to spurn anyreliance on “Wall Street” and the investment bankers.Another successful tactic of the investment banking houses was to acquirecontrol of the rapidly burgeoning life insurance companies. Total assets of lifeinsurance companies had increased ten-fold from 1867 to 1897.[2][part0010.html#fn2] Since these companies were “owned” by a self-perpetuatingboard of trustees who could not earn profits from the companies’ assets, lifeinsurance executives were more motivated to maintaining assets than to seekprofits with alacrity. Hence, they were ripe for takeover by investment bankinghouses, who could try to gain control of the boards of trustees and have thempurchase securities of industrial companies, controlled by the banksthemselves.[3] [part0010.html#fn3]2. THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRYAs manufacturing developed in the decades after the Civil War, the temptation toseek monopoly, and thereby to attempt to restrict production and raise prices,infected industry after industry. The attempts took two forms. One was cartels,which had the same function as in railroads, with the same disastrous effectsunder the pressure of internal breakup and new external competition. Anotherform was mergers, an attempt to merge all firms within an industry into One BigFirm, which would then achieve the monopoly goal. To a certain extent, mergerswere beneficial and inevitable, as small firms took advantage of the expandingmarket to grow and merge into larger firms with larger and eventually corporatecapitalization, as the corporate form began to replace the self-owned firm orthe partnership. Similar mergers took place in the Eastern railroads after 1850,as small lines consolidated into a more efficient, larger line. But it was verydifferent to merge not from natural market forces but because of “ideology,”because of the will o’ the wisp of achieving monopoly through this route. Theresult of such mergers was as disastrous and very similar to the result ofcartels.The first important attempt at achieving industrial monopoly was in petroleum, anew industry which began with the first small oil well at Titusville, innorthwestern Pennsylvania, in 1859. Quickly springing up to refine the oilpumped into western Pennsylvania were numerous refiners in Cleveland. Emergingvery early out of the pack was a business genius, John D. Rockefeller.Rockefeller, who had begun in business as an impoverished bookkeeper, soon roseto be a wholesale commission grocer. By 1863, Rockefeller and Samuel Andrewswere the major partners in the largest kerosene refinery in Cleveland, theExcelsior Works. To form the company, Rockefeller invested his own funds andmoney borrowed from his father, relatives, friends, and associates. By 1867,Rockefeller had formed Rockefeller, Flagler & Andrews Co., with his brotherWilliam, Henry M. Flagler and Stephen V. Harkness as newly joined partners. Sogreat was the efficiency and so low the cost of their refineries that thecompany further expanded and merged with competing refiners, to incorporate in afew years, in 1870, as the Standard Oil Company of Ohio (SOHIO), a companypossessing the world’s largest oil refining capacity. SOHIO was capitalized at$1 million.It should be noted that SOHIO was a business and financial alliance of its majorowners, of whom Rockefeller was first among equals. From then on, and on intothe 20th century, these founding Standard Oil families tended to act together,to ally with one another, and to make investment decisions in tandem. Some ofthese founding families were: the Flaglers, the Harknesses, the Paynes, theBostwicks, the Pratts, the Brewsters, the Rogers, and the Archbolds.We have seen how Rockefeller participated in the South Improvement Company in1871, a failed attempt to cartelize both Eastern railroads and the oil industry.After that, Rockefeller tried to achieve the same result more permanently bybuying out all of his competitors. In contrast to historical legend, Rockefellerdid not attempt to achieve his dominance in the oil industry by the costly anddangerous process of driving them out of business by cutting prices sharply.Instead, Rockefeller simply bought out his competitors, and paid handsome pricesto boot. For one thing, he was anxious to keep the good will of the formerowners and to enlist their administrative capacities in the Standardorganization.Neither did Standard achieve its original dominance solely by obtaining railroadrebates. As we have indicated, all refineries, along with other industries, werereceiving rebates, some small competitors even receiving larger rebates thanStandard. SOHIO achieved its dominance by also being more efficient, bypioneering in innovative ways to cut costs and to improve product. Its costswere lower than its competitors. While Standard launched several technologicalinnovations and improved lubricating oils, its major innovations were inmanagement techniques. SOHIO pioneered in modern corporate management—in theexecutive committee system, in careful bookkeeping, in corporate accounting, andin systematic managerial reporting to a central review board.By 1879, Rockefeller had purchased refineries in Pittsburg, Philadelphia, NewYork, and Baltimore, and had obtained nearly 90% of American oil refiningcapacity and 80% of the pipelines. In 1882, Rockefeller and his allies expandedto form an overall Standard Oil Trust, with headquarters in New York City andcapitalized at $70 million. Individual firms in the different states hadexchanged their stock for pro rata shares in the new, seemingly monopoly, trust.But Standard Oil was never to retain the dominance it had achieved in 1879—adominance, by the way, that never even threatened to extend to marketing or tocrude oil production. For one thing, Standard Oil’s standing ready to purchaseany independent oil refinery at a handsome price functioned something like farmprice supports in later years. In brief, various shrewd entrepreneurs began torealize that if Rockefeller were foolish enough to stand ready to purchase anyoil refineries offered to him, well they would go heavily into a new, profitablebusiness: the building of oil refineries solely for the purpose of “forcing”Rockefeller to buy them. In their haste, these new refineries were sometimes noteven fit for the refining of oil; that they should seem to be so as to deceiveStandard Oil inspectors was sufficient. As a result, Rockefeller found himselfon a treadmill, paying out money for a steady stream of new refineries. Finally,in 1881, Rockefeller declared he would no longer pay “blackmail” to these newrefineries, and for the next few years, many overtures for sale by newindependent refiners were turned down by Rockefeller. By 1885, then, Rockefellerhad given up his attempt to achieve monopoly in oil refining by merger andpurchase. From then on, there were to continue to be 10–20% of refining capacityoutside the Standard Oil network, and ready to step in to increase competitionshould the opportunity arise.Typical of common distortions of the truth about the small competitors ofStandard Oil is the case of George Rice, a small Ohio refiner, who was lionizedin the press for his alleged martyrdom at the house of Standard Oil. In fact,Rice profited handsomely from his competition, so much so that his asking priceto Standard kept increasing. At the historians Hidy and Hidy relate:> ... Rice invited combat by darting into an area, cutting prices until> dangerous to profits, and then diverting his efforts to another spot. In 1881,> under the title of Black Death, he published a pamphlet of anti-Standard> statements. ... Standard Oil officials tried to silence him by attempting to> purchase his refinery, but they balked at paying his asking price, which rose> from an original $20,000 to a final $500,000. This represented either his> reassessment of his nuisance value or a remarkable growth in net assets within> less than a decade in the face of competition from a monopoly.[4]> [part0010.html#fn4]Despite its near monopoly of refining, Standard was clearly never able to useits position to restrict production and raise prices. The price of kerosene, themajor oil product during this period, fell drastically throughout these decadesas oil production greatly increased. Thus, the wholesale price of kerosene fellfrom 45 cents per gallon in 1863 to 6 cents per gallon in the mid-1890s.Production was increasing to tap a mass market, and, so long as government didnot restrict entry into the field, Standard always had to look to its laurels.In fact, Standard Oil’s virtual monopoly position began to slip by the early1880s. We have seen how Rockefeller had to abandon trying to achieve a monopoly.More slippage began to occur in the 1890s. Independent pipelines began to growto challenge Standard’s dominance in this area. Finally, after 1900, and longbefore the anti-trust dissolution of 1911 and unrelated to it, Standard’sdominance of petroleum refining began increasingly to fade. Whereas in 1899Standard Oil had 90% of the petroleum refining in the country, this share hadslipped to 84% during 1904–07, to 80% in 1911, and then to 50% (includingtogether all the separate Standard Oil companies) in 1921. The basic reason wasan increasingly conservative, stodgy, and bureaucratic management of theStandard Oil complex, a development accelerated by the retirement of the seniorRockefeller and other top executives by the late 1890s.Specifically, Standard made two grave mistakes because of its deficiententrepreneurial skills after 1900. It failed to grasp the crude oil revolution,namely that more and more crude was being discovered in the Texas, Gulf, andCalifornia areas. Rooted completely in the Pennsylvania-Ohio oil fields,Standard only grasped the significance of the new oil discoveries late in theday. As a result, new firms such as Texas Company and Gulf Oil were able tostead a march on Standard. Secondly, Standard was the last major firm to realizethat gasoline was replacing kerosene as the major petroleum product, a mightyshift occasioned by the two great technological industrial revolutions of thefirst decades of the 20th century: the shift from kerosene to electricity inproviding light, and the growth of the automobile as the major means of landtransportation. As a result, in 1899, 63% of total oil refined was kerosene; 20years later, however, the percentage was only 15%.Moreover, new independent refiners were attracted to the petroleum industry byStandard’s high profit margins. Whereas there was a total of 67 refiners in1899, they had more than doubled to 147 by 1911. The independents, furthermore,led Standard in various innovations in petroleum: in the concept of retail gasstations; in the discovery and production of petrochemicals; in tank cars andtank trucks for conveying oil.[5] [part0010.html#fn5]3. IRON AND STEELUntil very recently, iron and steel has been the glamor industry of theIndustrial Revolution. Any undeveloped country that wishes to feel modern makessure to subsidize and force-feed at least one large steel plant. In the UnitedStates, however, the iron and steel industry was chronically inefficientthroughout the 19th century. The Pittsburg ironmasters were the source ofAmerica’s first organized movement for a protective tariff in 1820, and for therest of the century Pennsylvania iron and steel manufacturers were in theforefront of cries for protection against more efficient British imports.Despite the high Republican tariffs, there were 719 companies either in theblast furnace, steel work, or rolling mill industry in 1889. Throughout the1880s and 1890s, there were repeated attempts at pools and cartels to reduceproduction and raise prices. Pools in pig iron, steel, steel billet, wire, andwire-nails all failed, breaking down from failure of one or more firms to abideby the agreement. Finally, a series of extensive mergers and trusts,incorporating 138 companies consolidated into six trusts, merged in turn to forma new mammoth trust-like holding company, the $1.4 billion United States SteelCorporation, in 1901. U.S. Steel was organized by J.P. Morgan, and represents ashift in industry from plowing-back of profits to finance and underwriting byinvestment banks. The power in the company soon became George W. Perkins, apartner of the House of Morgan. Even so, since there were still 223 firms withblast furnaces and 445 steel work and rolling mill companies by the turn of thecentury, U.S. Steel only controlled 62% of the market.Yet, despite its enormous size and its large share of the market, U.S. Steel didbadly from the beginning by any criteria. U.S. Steel shares, priced at $55 in1901, fell precipitately to $9 by 1904. Steel’s profits also dropped sharply,yielding 16% in 1902 and falling to less than 8% two years later. Steel pricesfell steadily, and U.S. Steel did not dare to raise prices for fear ofattracting new and active competitors. Finally, in late 1907, Judge Elbert H.Gary, chairman of the board of U.S. Steel and another Morgan man at the company,inaugurated a series of “Gary dinners” among steel leaders, to form “gentlemen’sagreements” to keep up the price of steel. But by as early as mid-1908, smallerindependents began cutting their prices secretly, and this broke the agreementsand forced U.S. Steel and then other majors to follow suit. By early 1909, eventhe formal structure of the Gary dinners had completely collapsed. Pricesconsequently fell sharply in 1908 and until U.S. entry into World War I. AsKolko writes, “The collapse of the Gary agreements is an important turning pointin the history of steel, for it represents the final failure of the promisedstability and profit that motivated the U.S. Steel merger.”[6][part0010.html#fn6]Then, despite further mergers acquired by U.S. Steel, and despite its ownershipof three-quarters of the Minnesota iron ore fields, U.S. Steel experienced—untilthe present day—a steady shrinkage in its share of the market. Thus, its shareof wire nails fell from 66% in 1901 to 55% in 1910 and its share of ingots andcastings declined from 63% in 1901–05 to 52.5% in 1911–1915. In 1909,furthermore, there were still 208 firms with blast furnaces and 446 firms withsteel works and rolling mills.The basic reason for U.S. Steel’s steady decline was the curse of alloverly-large corporations: technological and entrepreneurial conservatism. As inthe case of Standard Oil, U.S. Steel was consistently the last firm to embracemajor technological innovations in the steel industry. From 1900 to 1919, theopen-hearth steel process largely replaced the Bessemer process as the dominantway of producing steel; U.S. Steel was mired in the Bessemer method and was latein making the change. Similarly, in later decades, U.S. Steel was the last majorcompany to shift from the open-hearth to the basic oxygen process. Largelyinvested in the production of heavy steel, U.S. Steel was very slow to enter thenew and growing field of lighter steel products, of alloys or of structuralsteel. It was slow, also, to shift from ore to the use of scrap for rawmaterial.Hence, the Morgan attempt to create U.S. Steel as a stabilizing force fordominating and monopolizing the steel industry was as dismal a failure as theprevious pools and cartels. As Kolko concludes:> If nothing else, the steel industry was competitive before the World War, and> the efforts of the House of Morgan to establish control and stability over the> steel industry by voluntary, private economic means had failed. Having failed> in the realm of economics, the efforts of the United States Steel group were> to be shifted to politics.[7] [part0010.html#fn7]4. AGRICULTURAL MACHINERYBy the turn of the century, the agricultural machinery industry was dominated bytwo large firms: McCormick Harvester, owned by Cyrus McCormick and the McCormickfamily, and William Deering and Company. When the competition between McCormickand Deering became so intense that they began to buy iron ore and build rollingmills and thereby compete with iron and steel, Judge Gary, Morgan man andchairman of U.S. Steel, took a hand. At his suggestion, George W. Perkins,Morgan partner, threw his weight around and induced McCormick and Deering tomerge into a supposedly profitable farm machinery monopoly. Accordingly, in 1902International Harvester was formed, combining McCormick, Deering and threesmaller firms, with Perkins as chairman of the board. International Harvesterbegan with 85% of the harvester market, 96% of the binders, and 91% of themowers in the United States.But International Harvester floundered almost immediately. In the 15 monthsafter the merger the firm earned less than 1% profit; and even after extensivereorganization and jettisoning of deadwood the firm, in 1907 only paid 3 to 4%in dividends; and only began paying dividends on its common stock in 1910. Threesmall firms left out of the merger, Deere and Co., J.I. Case and Co., and OliverFarm Equipment Co., quickly expanded and developed a full line of machinery. In1909, there were still 640 farm manufacturing firms in the United States. Moresignificantly, International Harvester’s share of the market fell sharplyacross-the-board. Its share of binders had fallen to 87% in 1911; of mowers to75%; and of the harvesters it had declined to 80% in 1911 and then to 64% in1918. Of particular significance, International fell prey quickly to the curseof “monopoly” firms: sluggishness in developing or exploiting innovations.[8][part0010.html#fn8]5. THE SUGAR TRUSTWe may mention one more case study of attempted monopolization of an industry:the “Sugar Trust.” The sugar refining industry had attempted a cartel in 1882,but the agreement had fallen apart for the usual reasons. Five years later, theindustry attempted the merger route toward monopoly, forming the trust, theAmerican Sugar Refining Company.Conditions for success seemed propitious. The industry was geographicallyconcentrated; of the twenty-three refineries, ten were located in New York City,of which six were in Brooklyn. And of the latter, the three largest,constituting 55% of total sugar refining capacity in the country, were owned bythe Havemeyer family, headed by the formidable Henry O. Havemeyer.But even so, the trust would not have been attempted were it not for the veryhigh protective tariff that the sugar refiners had managed to wangle fromCongress. As Havemeyer later testified before Congress in 1899, “Without thetariff I doubt if we should have dared to take the risk of forming the trust ...I certainly should not have risked all I had ... in a trust unless the businesshad been protected as it was by the tariff.” And, in his testimony, Havemeyercoined a phrase that was to become famous: “The mother of all trusts is thecustoms tariff bill.”[9] [part0010.html#fn9] Democrats and free traders werefrom then on to link the protective tariff as the necessary condition of thedrive toward trusts and monopolization.The American Sugar Refining Company, when formed in 1887, possessed 80% of therefining capacity of the country. The importance of the tariff in making theattempt is seen by comparing the British and American prices. Thus, in 1886, theprice of British refined sugar, including transportation costs to the UnitedStates, was $4.09 per cwt. This compared to the price of American refined sugar,which amounted to $6.01. Thus, it is clear that only the protective tariffallowed the American industry to compete at all.The American Sugar Refining Co. promptly did what it had been formed to do: cutproduction and raise prices. Its 20 plants were dismantled and reduced to ten,and it was able to raise its price to $7.01 in 1888 and $7.64 in 1889.But a grave problem quickly arose, for as the Sugar Trust cut its ownproduction, independents, eager to take advantage of the higher prices,increased theirs, so that the Trust’s share of the total refined sugar marketbegan to fall precipitously: to 73% in 1888 and 66% the following year.Particularly annoying to the Trust was the entrant into the industry, under theumbrella of its own price increases, of Claus Spreckles, “the sugar king of theSandwich Islands.” Spreckles built modern new plants in Philadelphia andBaltimore that were able to outcompete the older refineries. By 1891, therefining capacity of the independents had almost doubled, and prices had fallendrastically to $4.69, and reached $4.35 in 1892.The Trust was in deep trouble, but the new McKinley Tariff of 1890, which putimported raw sugar on the free list, emboldened it to try once more. And so theTrust bought out Spreckles, merging into the grand new American Sugar RefiningCompany in 1892, with no less than 95% of the nation’s total sugar production.But there was still a serpent in Eden. For old sugar hands, seeing theiropportunity, moved into refining with new and competitive plants. Adolph Segal,for example, posed a similar problem to the Trust that Rockefeller had faced inpetroleum: for he apparently made a business out of building sugar refinerieswhich the Trust felt obliged to purchase. In one case, in 1895, Segal built theU.S. Sugar Refining Company at Camden, New Jersey, which, upon purchase by theTrust, was found to be totally inoperative because of the lack of a proper watersupply.As a result of the new competition by independents, the price of sugar, whichhad risen to $4.84, fell back to $4.12 in 1894, and the American Sugar RefiningCo. only had 85% of the sugar market. During the next two years, the refinersattempted another cartel agreement, the agreement covering 90% of sugarproduction. But the result was the entry into sugar refining, in the next coupleof years, of Claus Dorscher and the Arbuckle Brothers. The Arbuckle refinery, inparticular, was able to break the cartel, with its low cost and superiorproduct. The Dingley Tariff of 1897, which levied a high tariff on raw sugar,raising its price in the U.S. by 18%, made times still more difficult for thesugar refinery industry. As early as 1898, the Sugar Trust only produced 75% oftotal national output.In 1900–01, the industry tried once again. Arbuckle and Havemeyer formed acartel which included almost all Eastern refiners, and Dorscher and otherindependents merged into American to bring the Sugar Trust’s share of nationaloutput back up to 90% by 1902. Sugar prices rose from $4.50 in 1897 to $5.32 in1900.Once again, however, the Trust could not maintain a monopoly position. New sugarplants, including a modern one built by Spreckles, again entered the industry.Furthermore, beet sugar, which had only been 4% or less of total sugarproduction, now received a notable spur from the high Dingley Tariff on raw canesugar imports. Seeing this, the Sugar Trust tried to maintain its quasi-monopolyposition by buying up beet sugar companies after 1901. But, by 1905, AmericanSugar Refining was forced to abandon this costly policy as a losing proposition.When it did so, in 1905, the Sugar Trust, including its cartel, only controlled70% of total sugar production, which included 70% of total beet sugarproduction. Increased competition had also brought sugar prices down to $4.52 by1906.After 1905, furthermore, when the Sugar Trust abandoned its policy of buying upcompeting beet sugar companies, beet sugar won a greater share of the totalmarket (increasing from 4% in 1905 to 14% in 1911), while the Trust’s share ofbeet sugar production fell to 54% in the same year. In fact, its control of thelatter was largely soft; it controlled the majority stock of only 8% of the beetsugar market.By 1917, the share of the Sugar Trust had fallen to 28% of the total market.Indeed, the subsequent story of the American Sugar Refining Company is stronglyreminiscent of the history of U.S. Steel:> There is no evidence to indicate that the sugar refiners were successful in> their aim of reestablishing the cartel. Consequently, with wisdom and faith,> they turned to one of the more efficient cartel promoters, the government. The> government was singularly successful in cartelizing the industry during World> War I during the Food Administration Act.[10] [part0010.html#fn10]6. OVERALL ASSESSMENTA typical example of the rapid rise and fall of the trust, peaking during thegreat merger wave of 1897–1901, was the National Biscuit Company. It was formedin 1898 as a great combination of three previous regional combinations, designedto monopolize the biscuit market, to purchase competitors, and to controlcompetition by restricting production and raising prices. The result wasdisaster, as the National Biscuit Company admitted in a remarkable confession inits Annual Report for 1901. Announcing a complete change of policy from itsprevious aim of controlling competition, the Annual Report declared:> When we look back over the four years [since National Biscuit Company was> founded], we find that a radical change has been wrought in our methods of> business. ... [W]hen this company started, it was thought that we must control> competition, and that to do this we must either fight competition or buy it.> The first meant a ruinous war of prices, and a greater loss of profit; the> second, a constantly increasing capitalization. Experience soon proved to us> that, instead of bringing success, either of these courses, if persevered,> must bring disaster. This led us to reflect whether it was necessary to> control competition ... we soon satisfied ourselves that within the Company> itself we must look for success.> > We turned our attention and bent our energies to improving the internal> management of our business, to getting full benefit from purchasing our raw> materials in large quantities, to economizing the expenses of manufacture, to> systematizing and rendering more effective our selling department; and above> all things and before all things to improve the quality of our goods and the> condition in which they should reach the customer.> > It became the settled policy of this Company to buy out no competition ...[11]> [part0010.html#fn11]By the turn of the 20th century, in fact, businessmen had become disillusionedwith trust combinations. In trust after trust, higher prices brought about bythe combine simply attracted new and powerful competitors—and this after thetrust had expended a great deal of resources in buying out previous competition.As the influential Iron Age lamented, trouble confronted the trust especially“where the combination is naming confessedly high prices for its goods and is atthe same time under heavy expenses on account of buying out competitors orsubsidizing them to keep out of the market.” Moreover, the New York Financierstated:> The most serious problem that confronts trust combinations today is> competition from independent sources... When the papers speak of a cessation> of operation in certain trust industries, they fail to mention the awakening> of new life in independent plants ...[12] [part0010.html#fn12]In his study of the success of the trusts at the end of the 19th century, ArthurS. Dewing divided the waves into the first, from the late 1880s to 1893, and thesecond and by far the larger wave, from 1897–1901 or a little later. Heconcluded that the trusts came to a sudden halt simply because they turned outbadly.[13] [part0010.html#fn13] They did not succeed in suppressing competition;they did not realize the heady expectations of their founders. Shares of stockin the new trusts steadily declined, and few managed to pay dividends. Many ofthe trusts even failed outright.Taking a random sample of 35 trusts formed during both waves, Dewing found asfollows: that the average earnings of the separate firms just before theformation of the trust was about 20% greater than the trust in its first year,and was also greater than the average earnings of the trust in its first tenyears or in its tenth year. Furthermore, the average expected estimates of thepromoters and bankers responsible for the trusts exceeded actual first yearearnings by 50%, and was also considerably higher than over the first ten years.Of the 35 combinations, only four had earnings equal to expectations.[14][part0010.html#fn14]There are other ways of revealing similar conclusions. Thus, of nearly 100consolidations formed in 1899–1900, three-quarters were not paying dividends in1900. Alfred L. Bernheim’s study of 109 corporations with a capitalization of$10 million and up in 1903, found that 16 failed before 1914, 24 paid nodividends during 1909–1914, and only 22 paid dividends of over 5% during thisperiod. The average dividend for this period was a puny 4.3% for thesecompanies. Or, put another way, of the 50 largest corporations in 1909, 27 haddropped out of the 100 by 1929, while 61 of the 100 in 1909 had dropped out ofthe ranks by the latter year.[15] [part0010.html#fn15]Dewing concluded from this study that businesses who analogized from economiesof scale to a quest for One Big Firm in their industry had committed a graveerror. They overlooked that there were definite limits to the economic size of afirm. In particular, managerial ability, individual human judgment, andinitiative are extremely scarce and cannot be automated and routinized into onegiant firm. Mere large size, he pointed out, was often a handicap in competingwith smaller, more mobile competitors—competitors who had lower overhead costs,who could leave the industry in bad years and return in good ones, and who couldshop around quietly for raw materials without being so big as to significantlyraise their own costs. Moreover, he might have added that smaller competitorswere very often better innovators, less bureaucratic, and more open to new ideasand new methods; indeed, they were not struck with obsolescing fixed plants.Dewing concluded with these wise words:> I have been impressed throughout by the powerlessness of mere aggregates of> capital to hold monopoly; I have been impressed, too, by the tremendous> importance of individual, innate ability, or its lack, in determining the> success or failure of any enterprise. With these observations in mind, one may> hazard the belief that whatever “trust problem” exists will work out its own> solution. The doom of the inefficient waits on no legislative regulation. It> is rather delayed thereby. Restrictive regulation will perpetuate the> inefficient corporation, by furnishing an artificial prop to support natural> weakness; it will hamper the efficient by impeding the free play of personal> ambition.[16] [part0010.html#fn16]We have pointed out earlier in this chapter that industrial corporations andstock shares only appeared in the mid-1890s. It is no coincidence, therefore,that it was the investment bankers, who promoted and underwrote suchcorporations—led by J.P. Morgan—who took the lead in forming corporate mergersin the same period and attempting to achieve the alleged advantages of monopolyprices. U.S. Steel was but one example of such a failed monopoly.In manufacturing as well as railroads, then, mergers as well as cartels hadsystematically failed to achieve the fruits of monopoly on the free market.[17][part0010.html#fn17] It was time, then, for those industrial and financialgroups who had sought monopoly to emulate the example of the railroads: to turnto government to impose the cartels on their behalf. Except that even more thanin the railroads, the regulation would have to be ostensibly in opposition to abusiness “monopoly” on the market, and even more would it have to be put throughin conjunction with the opinion-molding groups in the society. The stage wasset, at the turn of the 20th century, for the giant leap into statism to becomeknown as the Progressive Period.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0010.html#ft1] [Editor’s footnote] U.S. Department of Commerce,Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1957 (Washington,D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1960), pp. 7, 90, 115, 127, 139, 355, 365–66,414–17.

Standard was able to ensure low rebates for the oil itshipped relative to its competitors, and if a railroad Standard shipped oil withcut rebates for one of their competitors, they would retaliate by reducing theamount of oil it shipped with the railroad. See Elizabeth Granitz and BenjaminKlein, “Monopolization by ‘Raising Rivals’ Costs’: The Standard Oil Case,”Journal of Law and Economics (April, 1996): 1–47. However, it should be notedthat as expected, railroads still did frequently try to cut rebates toStandard’s competitors in order to boost their sales, and new oil was discoveredand refineries opened up in areas of the country which Standard did not havecontrol over.

LITURGICALSHow could America experience a great leap into statism after 1900, a leap thatwent virtually unchallenged? What happened to the long-standing Americantradition of individual liberty and laissez-faire? How could it so meekly rollover and play dead after having been dominant, or at least vibrant, during thelast half of the 19th century, and for over half a century before that? Toanswer this question, we must explore what the “new political historians,” inthe past decade, have been analyzing as the sudden end of the “third partysystem” in the United States in the year 1896.[1] [part0011.html#fn1] It wasthat sudden collapse that spelled the doom of laissez-faire in American partypolitics and paved the way for the unchallenged statism of the ProgressivePeriod and, indeed, for the remainder of the 20th century.1. THE THIRD PARTY SYSTEMFor the last decade or so, political historians have been analyzing not merelyindividual elections, but the way in which the political parties and theirconstituencies have interrelated, persisted, and then changed over time. Theyhave identified a series of “party systems,” of such structural politicalrelationships, in American history. The first was between the Federalists andthe Democratic-Republicans, a conflict which began in the 1790s and continuedapproximately until the War of 1812. After that, America had a single party,which continued until the late 1820s, when the Democratic Party was developed tochallenge the existing party, and this precipitated the formation of the WhigParty in opposition. The Democrats vs. the Whigs, lasting from the 1820s untilthe 1850s, constituted the second American party system. The formation of theRepublican Party in the 1850s over the slavery question and the disappearance ofthe Whigs precipitated the third party system.The most important point to note is that all three party systems in the 19thcentury differed radically from the American party system today. Politicalscientists, journalists, and the Establishment generally laud the current twoparty system as gloriously non-ideological—as providing very little choicebetween fuzzy programs which overlap almost completely—so that the only choicein this bipartisan haze of issues is between the personalities of the candidatesrather than the programs of the parties. Political parties, and moreparticularly party programs and platforms, mean very little these days in theactual conduct of government, particularly in the dominant executive branch,whether on the federal, state, or local level. Deprived of meaningful choice,the public manifests increasing apathy, voter participation rates steadily drop,and more and more people call themselves “independent” rather than identify withany particular party.It was not always thus. In the 19th century, during all three party systems, theparties were fiercely ideological. Their constituencies were partisan, and voterparticipation rates in elections were very high. Platforms meant something andwere battled over. So firmly drawn were the lines that it was rare for aRepublican to vote Democrat or vice versa; disenchantment in one’s party wasrather reflected in a failure to vote. The drive of each party, therefore, wasnot to capture the floating independent voter by moving toward the middle, but,on the contrary, to whip up the enthusiasm of its own militant supporters, andthereby to “bring out the new vote.”Throughout the 19th century—with the single and grave exception of slavery—theDemocratic Party (and before it, the Democratic-Republicans) was thelibertarian, laissez-faire party—the “party of personal liberty,” of free trade,of hard money, the separation of the economy, religion, and virtually everythingelse from the State; the opponent of Big Government, high taxes, public works(“internal improvements”), judicial oligarchy, or federal power, the champion ofthe free press, unrestricted immigration, state and individual rights. TheFederalists, on the other hand, and after them the Whigs and then theRepublicans, were the party of statism: of Big Government, public works, a largepublic debt, government subsidies to industry, protective tariffs, opposition toaliens and immigrants, and of cheap money and government control of banking(through a central bank, or later, through the quasi-centralized nationalbanking system). The Whigs, in particular, strove to use the State to compelpersonal morality: through a drive for Prohibition, Sunday blue laws, or adesire to outlaw the Masons as a secret society. The Republicans, who wereessentially the Whigs with the admixture of anti-slavery Democrats, became knownquite aptly as “the party of great moral ideas.” After the Civil War, whenslavery was no longer a blot on America, the Democrats could be a far lesssullied champion of personal liberty, while the Republican drive for “moralideas” became more susceptible to libertarian irony, being fully coercive andnow in no sense liberating.[2] [part0011.html#fn2]The first party system began in the 1790s when the Democratic-Republican Partywas launched in order to combat the Federalist program of economic statism: hightariffs, public works, centralized government, public debt, government controlof banking and cheap money, and of repressive federal tyranny against Democraticcritics in the press. The Democratic-Republicans also strove to end the ultimatecontrol of the government by a judicial oligarchy and to end militarism byabolishing the navy and standing army. After winning with Thomas Jefferson’sassumption to the presidency in 1800 and partially achieving their platform, theDemocratic-Republicans faltered and then themselves began to go down the road tofederalism by driving toward war with their ancient foe, Great Britain. Thepro-British Federalists were effectively destroyed for opposing the War of 1812,but their program was put into effect by their foes in the course of launchingand fighting a (necessarily statist) war: high protective tariffs, federaldomestic excise taxation, a central bank, inflationary bank credit expansion,public debt, public works, and, to boot, a one party system by the end of thewar.Brooding in retirement at Monticello, Jefferson lamented at what his Virginiasuccessors to the presidency, James Madison and James Monroe, had wrought. Theyhad ended by installing a one party Federalism without the Federalists. Beinghuman, Jefferson was not as keenly alive to his own crucial role in launchingthe drive toward war and therefore toward the very Federalism that he sobitterly deplored. Inspired and converted by separate weekend pilgrimages toMonticello, two important young politicians: Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri andespecially Martin Van Buren of New York, determined to take up the mighty taskof creating a new political party, a party designed to take back America fromFederalism, and to restore the good old principles of ’76 (the AmericanRevolution and the Declaration of Independence) and of ’98 (of the Kentucky andVirginia Resolutions which called for a virtual revolution of states against thedespotic national Alien and Sedition Laws). Basing themselves in New York,Missouri, and on the old Jeffersonians in Virginia, the new party sought acharismatic leader and found him in Andrew Jackson. The new Democratic Party wasborn, dedicated to personal liberty, minimal government, free trade, hard money,and the separation of government from banking. The opposition Whigs revived thenationalist-statist Federalist program, except that the Whigs were moreinterested in compulsory morality and restricting the flood of immigrants, andadopted demagogic democratic techniques and rhetoric in contrast to the franklyelitist and anti-universal suffrage and anti-democratic outlook of theFederalist Party.It should be noted that in both of the first two party systems, the libertarian,laissez-faire party slowly but surely began to establish itself as the dominantmajority party in America. The Federalists faded with the triumph of Jefferson,but Jeffersonian principles could not survive the drive that he himself hadlaunched toward war. In the second party system, too, the Democrats began toestablish themselves as the majority party, and it seemed once again as ifAmerica would move rapidly toward the libertarian, laissez-faire ideal. On thefederal level, the quite feasible Jacksonian plan was to have eight years ofJackson, eight of Van Buren, and eight of Benton—24 solid years in which toachieve their goals. Eight years of Jackson from 1828 to 1836 was indeedsucceeded by four years of Van Buren. Then, the timetable was brieflyinterrupted by the victory of the first modern demagogic presidential campaign,replete with all the propaganda techniques we are now familiar with: slogans,parades, buttons, all engineered by the master Whig political technician,Thurlow Weed. But everyone knew that the Democrats, who could easily copy thesetechniques four years later, would win in 1844, and Van Buren prepared to resumethe victorious timetable. But then, the great issue of the expansion of slaverycame to split the Democratic Party—in the form of the admission of Texas to theUnion as a slave state—and Jackson and Van Buren also split on the issue. Whilethe Democrats remained Jacksonian in most matters, Jacksonianism was pushed tothe background as the Democrats became a Southern-based pro-slave party. TheRepublican Party, including some Northern Democrats, was then founded in the1850s to become the party opposed to slave expansion and, then, in the CivilWar, to uphold the unitary power of the national Union as against the right ofstate secession. The third American party system had begun.The Republican Party, which only got 40% of the popular vote in 1860, seized theopportunity presented by the South’s walkout and the resulting near one partyCongress to ram through the old Whig economic program: inflationary paper money,central control over banking, high tariffs, massive government subsidies torailroads, high federal excise taxation over the “immoral” commodities liquorand cigarettes, plus such centralizing and statist measures as conscription andthe income tax. It is no wonder that the Republicans should have been dominantduring and immediately after the War in the Reconstruction period.[3][part0011.html#fn3]Many historians are under the erroneous impression that the Republicanscontinued to be dominant until 1912, or even until 1932, with only two terms ofGrover Cleveland’s presidency interrupting the smooth march of Republicanvictory. This impression, however, is mistaken. As the new political historianshave reminded us, the Democratic Party captured the House of Representatives in1874—and followed by really gaining the presidency in 1876, only to see itpurloined in Congress by the Republicans in a bargain that liquidatedReconstruction in the South. From 1874 until 1896, a space of 22 years, the twoparties were nip-and- tuck in all races for the Congress and the presidency.From 1875 to 1895, the Republicans controlled the House of Representatives inonly two out of the ten sessions, reaching the peak of their control in 1888with 51.1% of the House membership. But, on the other hand, though the Democratscontrolled the House in eight of the ten sessions, their peak membership was 71%in 1890, and only five times did they receive as much as 55.0% of the totalvote. In the five presidential contests between 1876 and 1892, the Republicanscaptured only three races, and two of the victories (1876 and 1888) wereachieved with fewer popular votes than the Democratic nominee. The Republicanpresidential nominee did not receive a majority of the popular vote in anyelection between 1876 and 1892, and had a plurality only in 1880, and then byonly a couple thousand votes. On the other hand, the Democrats only controlledthe Senate twice in the 20 year period in 1878–80 and 1892–94. Only once did theRepublicans control the presidency and both houses of Congress at the same time,and only once did the Democrats accomplish the same feat.Furthermore, the Democrats were slowly gaining the ascendancy, so that, ashappened at the end of the two previous party systems, the Democratic Party wasslowly but inexorably moving toward long run dominance. This development wasembodied in the Democratic landslide to capture the House in 1890 and inCleveland’s easy return to a second term in the presidency in 1892, whichcarried the Democrats to control both houses of Congress for the first cleansweep since the Civil War.[4] [part0011.html#fn4] And then something happened toclobber the Democratic Party in 1896, and to reduce it to a rather patheticminority party at least until 1912 (and more accurately until 1928 since WoodrowWilson’s election in 1912 was only made possible by a grave split withinRepublican ranks). What cataclysmic event occurred in 1896—so much so as tousher in a new, fourth party system for the next 32 years—will be the subject ofthe next few chapters.2. PIETISTS VS. LITURGICALS: THE POLITICAL PARTY CONSTITUENCIESIn 1970, in a brilliant and seminal work titled The Cross of Culture: A SocialAnalysis of Midwestern Politics: 1850–1900, Professor Paul Kleppner provided acogent and illuminating explanation for the constituencies of the third partysystems. It is a thesis since amply confirmed by other historians.[5][part0011.html#fn5] The thesis explains not only which groups tended to supportwhich parties, but also the specific process by which that support was generatedand strengthened.Briefly, the Kleppner thesis holds that “Pietist” religious groups tended (a) tofavor statism, both in the personal and the economic spheres, and (b) thereforeconsistently supported the Republicans as the statist party, while theLiturgicals, consisting largely of Catholics and conservative Lutherans (a)favored liberty, both in the personal and economic spheres, and (b) thereforesupported the Democrats as the Libertarian party. Kleppner, indeed, in examiningdetailed voting and religious records for the Midwestern states, breaks downLutherans and other Protestant groups into varying degrees of Pietism andLiturgicalism and is able to show a one-to-one correlation between the degree ofcommitment to the liturgical outlook and the degree of voting support to theDemocratic Party. The great exception to this correlation, of course, was theSouth, overwhelmingly pietist and yet which voted Democratic because of thespecial circumstances, memories, and consequences of the Civil War.The genesis of these differing world outlooks Kleppner analyzes as beginningwith basic theology. The pietists were those who held that each individual,rather than the church or the clergy, was responsible for his own salvation.Salvation was a matter, not of following prescribed ritual or even of cleavingto a certain fixed creed, but rather of an intense emotional commitment orconversion experience by the individual, even to the extent of believing himself“born again” in a special “baptism of grace.” Moreover, the outward sign—theevidence to the rest of society for the genuineness and the permanence of agiven individual’s conversion—was his continuing purity of behavior. And sinceeach individual was responsible for his own salvation, the pietists concludedthat society was duty-bound to aid each man in pursuing his salvation, inpromoting his good behavior, and in seeing as best it could that he does notfall prey to temptation. The emphasis of the pietists was on converting themaximum number of persons, and in helping them to become and to remain sound.Society, therefore, in the institution of the State, was to take it upon itselfto aid the weaker brethren by various crusading actions of compulsory morality,and thus to purge the world of sin. The secular and the religious were to beconjoined. In the second half of the 19th century, the pietists concentrated onagitating for three such compulsory measures on the state and local level, tosave liturgical “sinners” despite themselves: Prohibition, to eradicate the sinof alcohol; Sunday blue laws, to prevent people from violating the Sabbath; and,increasingly toward the end of the century, compulsory public schooling to“Americanize” the immigrants and “Christianize the Catholics,” and to use theschools to transform Catholics and immigrants (often one and the same) intopietistic Protestant and nativist molds.The pietists, then, typically concentrated on the purity and propriety of eachindividual’s behavior. They were not particularly interested in creed or formaltheology, and since the emphasis was each individual’s direct confrontation withChrist, they were not particularly concerned with which specific church theperson might join. The typical pietist, therefore, switched denominations withrelative ease. The pietists, consequently, went heavily for numerousinterdenominational societies for social reform; the prohibition drives being agood case in point.[6] [part0011.html#fn6]The liturgicals, on the other hand—largely Catholics and German Lutherans, andalso Anglicans—had a very different theological and moral outlook. For theliturgical, the path toward salvation was in the hands of the Church and itspriests, and what the individual needed to do was to believe in and practice theprescribed ritual. Given these intellectual rather than emotional beliefs andthose rituals, the individual church member need not worry continually over hisown salvation; and, as for the salvation of his fellow citizens, that could beaccomplished, insofar as was possible, if they joined the Church. The Churchrather than the State, then, was in charge of morality and salvation, and hencethe State need and should have nothing to do with moral and theological matters.As Professor Jensen, whose studies of the Middle West have confirmed Kleppner’sfindings, has put it: “[For the liturgical] the Church itself would attend toall matters of morality and salvation ... hence the State had no right to asserta role in delineating public morality.”[7] [part0011.html#fn7]The liturgical was also rather sensibly puzzled over the intense hostility ofthe pietists toward alcohol, especially when Jesus himself had drunk wine. “Wedo not believe in making sin what God made not sin,” was a typical liturgicalresponse. To the liturgical, sin was not such “impure” behavior as drinkingalcohol, but heresy and refusal to believe the theological creed of the Churchor to obey its prescribed ritual. As Jensen summarized the difference: theMethodists expelled members for impure behavior; the liturgicals for heresy. Itwas quite clear, moreover, that such theological matters as heresy and liturgycould hardly be considered matters for State intervention and enforcement.It should be noted that while liturgicals consisted mainly of such groups asCatholics and Lutherans, they also included some sects, such as orthodoxCalvinists, who emphasized creed rather than ritual, and so could not in thestrict sense be called “liturgical.” Their attitude toward the vital importanceof the particular church and of correct belief was similar, however, and thisset them apart from the pietistic Protestants. Such groups included “Old School”Presbyterians and a few groups of Baptists.The liturgical correctly perceived the pietist as the persistent, hectoringbusybody and aggressor: hell-bent to deprive him of his Sunday beer and hisvoluntarily supported parochial schools, so necessary to preserve and transmithis religion and his values. While the pietist was a pestiferous crusader, theliturgical wanted nothing so much as to be left alone. It is no wonder that theRepublican Party, the party of the pietists, the party that catered toprohibitionists, blue-law agitators and compulsory public school advocates, wasknown throughout this period as “the party of great moral ideas.” While theDemocrats, the party of the liturgicals, the party deeply opposed to compulsorymorality, were known as the “party of personal liberty.”[8][part0011.html#fn8][9] [part0011.html#fn9]To a late 20th-century observer, one of the most puzzling things about19th-century party politics is the enormous amount of interest and passion spenton economic issues. Professors who can scarcely interest their own students ineconomic matters must marvel at presidential campaigns at which such esotericmatters as protective tariffs, central banking, and gold and silver standardswere intense objects of general public attention and partisan debate. How didthe mass of the public get interested in such arcane matters?The Kleppner analysis explains this enigma. The interest and passions of bothparty constituencies were first engaged on the religious-cultural, the gut locallevel. The constant prods were such issues as liquor, blue laws, and the publicschools. Then, with partisan passions engaged on the local and religious level,the leaders and ideologists of both parties were able to widen the consciousnessof their respective constituencies to brilliantly link up the local with thenational, the personal with the economic. Thus, the Republican leaders wouldtell their pietist constituents “You believe in strong state and localgovernments to protect the morals of the public. In the same way, you shouldfavor strong federal government to protect Americans from cheap foreigncompetition, to expand their purchasing-power through plentiful money and cheapcredit (through greenbacks, government control of the banking system, or freesilver), government subsidies to business and large-scale public worksexpenditures.”At the same time, the Democratic leaders would tell their liturgicalconstituents, “You know that the pietists are determined to deprive you of yourwholesome pleasures such as beer and Sunday sports in the name of their ownpeculiar version of morality. They are trying to take away your parochialschools. Now the same pietists, the same Republicans, who are nagging andoppressing you on the state level are also trying to interfere with your libertyand property on the federal level. They are trying to expand their local moralpaternalism to national economic paternalism. They are trying to tax you tosubsidize privileged interests, they are trying to keep you from consuming cheapforeign products, and they are trying to deprive you of the fruits of yourthrift and savings through cheap money and inflation.”In short, both parties were able to link up statism and Big Government inWashington and at home, to connect the economic and the personal. TheRepublicans, the party of statism, lined up squarely against the Democrats, theparty of liberty.[10] [part0011.html#fn10] In those decades, there wascontinuing drift of both parties from the center, no deliberate fuzzing of theissues and of all differences. On the contrary, the differences were emphasizedin order to appeal to the respective constituencies and to keep their interestfired up.Many historians have concluded that, throughout most of the 19th century, therewas an anti-immigrant animus by native-born Americans, and that the Democratsbecame the immigrant-based party while the Republicans attracted the nativists.But Kleppner shows that the basic division was not really between native-bornand immigrants, or between English speaking and foreigners. PietisticScandinavian immigrants, for example, identified with native WASPs very quicklyand readily voted Republican. The real division was Pietist vs. Liturgical, andit so happened that the bulk of immigrants were indeed liturgicals, so as tomake these immigrants a made-to-order target for pietist bigotry. Restrictingimmigration would almost certainly hit far more severely at liturgicals, andhence benefit the Republican Party.The emergence of different forms of the Christian religion as the key topolitical conflicts lends an ironic twist to American history. For twice in thehistory of America, Christianity had virtually died out. The first time was inthe early decades of the 18th century, when Calvinism had given way to the newEnlightenment trends of liberalism and rationalism. But orthodox Christianityrevived in the 1730s and 1740s with the Great Awakening—a new form of pietistChristianity which swept the colonies through the revivalist and evangelicalmethods of intensely emotional and frenzied conversions.[11][part0011.html#fn11]But then, late in the 18th century, Christianity began to die once more—to bereplaced by the rationalist deism of the Enlightenment. By the time the UnitedStates was founded, it was clear that Christianity was giving way across theboard—among the upper classes and among the general public.For the second time, however, Christianity made a remarkable comeback—and onceagain through a series of frenzied revivals that took place throughout thecountry in the 1820s and 1830s. These revivals, of course, were necessarilypietist, and pietism’s emotional and crusading tone and thrust began with thisfinal upsurge of the early 19th century. Apart from a few Anglicans, there hadbeen very few liturgicals in the America of the 1790s. Essentially, native WASPswere pietist; the ranks of the liturgicals were to be fed, during the 19thcentury, by Catholic and Lutheran immigrants from Europe.From the beginning of the revival movement in the 1820s, the resurrectedpietists began to form organizations to root out sin among their fellow men.Their two dominant concerns were the sins of slavery and of alcohol. At first,the idea was to ban the saloon, presumably the central iniquity in thedissemination of alcohol. By the late 1830s, the pietists had escalated theirdemands to include total abstinence and total prohibition, including wine andbeer as well as hard liquor. In 1851, the pietists began to succeed, gettingliquor totally banned in Maine. This step was followed by numerous otherprohibition laws or constitutional amendments in 12 states during the early1850s.After 1855, however, the pietists temporarily abandoned the prohibitionistcrusade to concentrate on slavery. After the Civil War, the pietists were ableto devote all their energies to the evils of alcohol. In 1868, the pietisticprohibitionists founded a secret society, the Good Templars, which soon had400,000 members. In Michigan, in the following year, the Templars helped formthe Prohibitionist Party; the foundation of the Women’s Christian TemperanceUnion followed in 1874. By the 1880s, prohibition had become the leadingpolitical issue in the Middle West and in most of the rest of the country.[12][part0011.html#fn12]3. PIETISTS VS. LITURGICALS IN THE MIDWESTThe Pietist/Liturgical analysis has been worked out most fully for the vitallyimportant Midwestern states, the area where Kleppner himself did his pioneeringresearch, concentrating particularly on three critical states: Michigan, Ohio,and Wisconsin. In the Midwest, the Republicans began in the 1860s with asubstantial lead, obtaining approximately 55% in the presidential elections,while the Democrats obtained about 44%. But then, after 1874, the Republicanscould no longer obtain a clear majority. The Republican vote ranged from 49% to52% from 1876 to 1888, and then fell to 47% in 1892. In Michigan, Ohio, andWisconsin, the Republicans fell below 50% of the vote by 1874, and never reallygained a majority after that. The Democratic rise did not match the Republicandecline, the Democratic vote in the Midwest ranging narrowly from 45% to 47% inthe presidential contests from 1884 to 1892. It should not be thought that therewas any significant shift of blocs of voters from Republican to Democratic; onthe contrary, two forces were at work: a defection of Republican voters to thirdparties, especially the Prohibitionists, and a shift of the relative votingpopulation, so that strong Republican areas became a smaller proportion, andstrong Democratic areas a larger proportion, of the total vote.[13][part0011.html#fn13]As Kleppner points out, the nip-and-tuck struggle in the Midwest was in no senseurban vs. rural, categories that historians tend to look for in explainingconflict. Elections were extremely close, for example, in all the urban areas ofthe region. In 1888, in the 14 largest cities of Michigan, the Democratsaveraged 48% of the vote while the Republicans averaged the same 48%, in the 22largest cities in Ohio, the respective averages were 48% and 49%, and in the 9major cities in Wisconsin, the Democrats averaged 46% and the Republicans 45%.It could not get closer than that. What is more, there had been little change inthese relative percentages since the 1876 presidential race.Neither could any class differentiation in voting be detected within the urbanwards. In 1888, the correlation between the Democratic percentage and thepercentage of working class in the wards was an extremely low +.035, a figurevery close to zero. In Detroit, one wealthy ward gave the Democrats 46% of thevote, while another voted a substantial 56% for the Democracy. One the otherhand, one very poor ward voted over 70% Democratic, while another, even poorerward, voted only 47%. On the other hand, if we examine the religious compositionof the wards, the party constituencies become clear. The strongest Democraticward was the most heavily Catholic, largely Polish, while another poor andheavily working class ward had a low Democratic vote, and it was very heavilynative-born and Protestant.Similarly, in Milwaukee, while the four wealthiest wards only voted 40%Democratic in 1888, the five poorest only voted 37%. The poorest and mostworking-class ward, on the other hand, also voted the strongest Democratic inthe city (68%), but another poor and working class ward was also the weakestDemocratic (13%); the explanation is that the former was almost wholly PolishCatholic, while the latter was strongly Protestant.In Chicago, in the same year, the correlation between the percentage ofCatholics in each ward and the percentage voting Democratic was a very high+.90, and this correlation persisted whether within lower-class or upper-classwards, the former wards correlating at +.88 and the latter at +.90.Orthodox historians have claimed that the farmers in this period wereoverwhelmingly Republican. But the difference was not very great, and in Ohio,in 1888, the parties tied (Republicans at 49%, Democrats at 48%). There was nosignificant correlation, furthermore, between party votes and the degree ofrural prosperity; in fact, townships of the same economic level within the samerural county often differed widely in their party affiliation. There was novisible correlation, either, by occupation. Neither was there any native-bornvs. immigrant bloc; far from being a monolith, immigrants varied widely in theirvoting patterns. The key, then, for both rural and urban areas, wasethnic-religious factors, which in contrast to the economic, have not beenconsidered “real” by most historians.[14] [part0011.html#fn14]Let us, following Paul Kleppner’s research, go down the list of ethnic-religiousgroups and examine their voting records.[15] [part0011.html#fn15] Historianshave been seduced by the prominence of Carl Schurz, German immigrant and leadingLiberal Republican, into believing that the Germans were largely Republican.[16][part0011.html#fn16] But Schurz was an anti-clerical liberal, who spoke only forhis own small group of prominent anti-clericals; most Germans were staunchlyCatholic or Lutheran, who would tend to reach against, rather than follow, theanticlericals. Most Germans were Democratic and anti-Republican.[17][part0011.html#fn17] By the late 1880s, there were approximately one-and-a-halfmillion German Protestants in the Middle West, and another one-and-a-halfmillion Catholics. The German Catholics were overwhelmingly Democratic: in everysection, urban or rural, of every state in the Midwest, on every economic level,and in every occupation. Every single German Catholic parish voted Democratic,from 1876 to 1888. The one million Lutherans were grouped in diverse sects,ranging from conservative and ultra-liturgical down to largely pietist. Theproportion voting Democratic correlates one-to-one with the degree by which eachsect was liturgical. Thus, the most liturgical group was the Wisconsin Synod,which voted overwhelmingly Democratic. The next most liturgical group was theMissouri Synod, which voted less heavily Democratic, and so down the line.A second factor determining voting was the province of Germany from which thevoters had originally hailed. But here, too, different provinces of Lutheransdiffered in the degree to which they were liturgical or pietist. Pietism wasstrongest in Southern and Western Germany, especially in Wurttemberg, while itwas weakest in Northern and Eastern Germany, in particular Pomerania. Hence, thePomeranians were the strongest Democrats, and the Wurttembergers were the leastDemocratic.[18] [part0011.html#fn18] The most liturgical provincial group wasthe “Old Lutherans,” who had come early to the United States from Pomerania inthe years 1839 to 1845. They had emigrated in reaction to the attempts of thePrussian monarchy to compel the unification of the Lutheran with the ReformedChurches. The Old Lutherans were therefore fiercely anti-evangelical andanti-pietist, and their townships tended to vote far more Democratic thanothers.Even the Old Lutherans, as with the other provinces, split in accordance withthe degree of their devotion to liturgy. Thus, the ultra-liturgical among theOld Lutherans joined the Wisconsin Synod, while those rather less devoted toliturgy entered into the conservative but less rigorous Missouri Synod. As wemight expect, the most heavily Democratic of the German Lutherans were thedistricts peopled by Old Lutheran members of the Wisconsin Synod. For example,let us consider two townships in Wisconsin of Old Lutheran Germans. Lebanontownship, Dodge County, consisting of members of the Wisconsin Synod, averagedno less than 90% Democratic from 1870 to 1888. On the other hand, Mequontownship, Ozaukee County, consisting of Old Lutherans, Missouri Synod, averaged75% Democratic during that period.On the other hand, if we take Pomeranians who were not “Old Lutherans,” theywere far less Democratic than the latter, but, again, within that group, theWisconsin Synod members were far more Democratic than the Missouri Synod. Thus,within the same county of Wisconsin, Marathon County, Berlin township (made upof non-Old Lutheran Pomeranians of the Wisconsin Synod) voted 76% Democratic in1880, while Texas township (consisting of Pomeranians of the Missouri Synod),voted only 47% Democratic in that year.The Missouri Synod, in its turn, was far more liturgical than other GermanLutheran groups. A striking contrast may be seen between two groups of (non-OldLutheran) Pomeranians in the same Presque Isle County, in Michigan. In 1888, theMissouri Synod Pomeranians, who made up the voters of Moltke township in thatcounty, voted 59% Democratic. On the other hand, Bismark township, comprised ofPomeranian members of the pietistic General Council, voted only 8% Democrat inthe same year.The Mecklenbergers were less liturgical and less Democratic than thePomeranians, but again, the Wisconsin Synod members were more Democratic thanthe Missouri or other synods. Thus, Greenville township, in Outagamie County,Wisconsin, a Wisconsin Synod Mecklenberger area, voted 59% Democratic, whilePlymouth township, Sheboygan County, made up of Missouri Synod Mecklenbergers,voted 36% Democrat. And in the same Marquette County in Wisconsin, made up of amixed group of Pomeranians and Mecklenbergers, Mecan township, consisting ofmembers of the Wisconsin Synod, voted 72% Democratic while Crystal Laketownship, of the Missouri Synod, voted only 46% Democrat.A third factor influencing voting patterns was the backlash effect; that is, inthose townships or wards where opposing religious groups lived side by side,friction and hostility came much more intensely to the fore. In particular, inthose townships where German Lutherans, even highly liturgical ones, had to rubelbows with their ancient foes, the ultra-liturgical Catholics, the Lutheranstended to vote more heavily Republican. A striking example is two townships inManitowoc County, Wisconsin. In Mishicott township, made up of Wisconsin SynodGermans, the vote in 1880 was 87% Democratic; but in Manitowoc township,consisting of a mixed group of Wisconsin Synod and German Catholics, theLutherans in reaction voted Republican en masse, making the total Democraticvote only 33%.The German Sectarians, evangelical and pietistic to the core, advocates ofProhibition and a holy Sabbath, voted largely Republican. The GermanEvangelicals voted heavily Republican, as did the United Brethren and the GermanMethodist Episcopals. On the other hand, the German Reformed Church, thoughpietistic, hated the more extreme German Evangelicals and voted mildlyDemocratic, although the vote fluctuated considerably over time. In general, theSectarian groups—in the backlash effect—voted more strongly Republican if livingnear other, more liturgical, Germans, while they were willing to vote moreevenly for the Democrats if there were no other German religious groups in thevicinity.The Scandinavians, whether recent immigrants or not, voted very stronglyanti-Democratic.[19] [part0011.html#fn19] This included the Norwegian Lutherans,whose votes for the Democratic Party varied from 0 to 38%, and most placesfluctuated only from 0 to 8%. Why was this true even of the Norwegian Synod,which tended to be liturgical? The reasons were rooted in recent Norwegianhistory. The Norwegian Lutheran Church was a compulsory, State Church—one thatwas highly formalized and liturgical. By the turn of the 19th century, apietistic reaction took place in Norway, led by Hans Nielsen Hauge, which wasrevivalist and evangelical. The Haugeans, however, formed a movement within thestate Lutheran Church, and never broke off from the official church. And since,the Norwegian Church had a very low ratio of clergy to population, there grew upa great many lay services in the country, headed by Haugean laymen. Soinfluential were the Haugeans that a less pietistic but highly influentialmovement, the Johnsonian Awakening headed by Gisle Johnson, developed within theState Church in the 1840s and 1850s. The pietistic Johnsonian pastors werewilling to work with the more extremely pietistic Haugean laymen to reform theChurch. The result was a thoroughgoing pietizing, or evangelizing, of theNorwegian Synod.Hence, while in the United States, the Haugeans headed by Elling Eielsen, brokeoff from the Norwegian Synod to form their own sect, both wings of NorwegianLutherans were heavily pietistic and hence strongly anti-Democratic. Butwhereas, the Norwegian Synod Lutherans ranged between 0 and 38% Democratic, themore extreme Haugeans tended to vote about 5% Democratic. Both wings werestrongly anti-alcohol and in favor of stern anti-Sabbath-breaking laws.The Swedish Lutherans, for their part, were even more Republican than theNorwegians, ranging from 0 to 28% Democratic. The Swedes, pastors as well aslaymen, had about all been pietistic dissenters within the establishedliturgical church of Sweden. It is clear from the Norwegian and the Swedishexamples that the Democratic vs. Republican breakdown was not really “native”vs. “immigrant.” For, in contrast to Catholic immigrants, the pietisticScandinavian immigrants took their place very promptly with the RepublicanParty. Even though, the Norwegian Synod operated their own parochial schools,more important to them were the pietistic issues of the drinking of liquor andthe “desecration” of the Sabbath.The British-Americans, English, Cornish, or Welsh were pietist and were alsoheavily Republican and anti-Democratic. Within the Gaelic British community, theardently pietistic Welsh Methodists were more strongly anti-Democrat than theCornish Methodists. Thus, in Iowa County, Wisconsin, two townships made upmainly of Cornish Methodists, Dodgeville and Mineral Point, voted 34% and 44%Democratic respectively in 1880, whereas Linden and Mifflin townships, bothlargely Welsh Methodists, voted 25% and 24% Democratic. And, in Columbia County,Wisconsin, Hazel Green township, which was mainly Cornish Methodist, voted 47%Democratic, while nearby Courtland township, being Welsh Methodist, voted only18% Democratic. In Michigan, on the other hand, the Cornish voted about 20% lessDemocratic than they did in Wisconsin, for in the former state there wereconstant battles between the Cornish and the Irish Catholics, who were heavilyDemocratic; again the backlash effect was at work.A fascinating example of a meaningful religious breakdown of even a townshipvote was Wilkesville township, in Vinton County, Ohio. Wilkesville township, in1880, voted 51% Democratic. But this moderate figure conceals a dramatic splitbetween two precincts within the township, a split that took place even thoughboth precincts were very poor farming areas. And yet, the eastern precinct voted21% Democratic, while the western precinct voted 72%. The difference was thatthe eastern precinct was English and Welsh Methodist, while the western precinctwas Irish Catholic.As for the Irish, the Catholics, both urban and rural, were very stronglyDemocratic, while the Protestants, being pietist, were equally stronglyRepublican. Among the Canadians, the Protestant English Canadians were heavilyRepublican, while the French Catholics were equally strongly Democratic. We cansee the ethnic religious factor at work, again, within the same occupationalgroup. Baraga township in Baraga County, Michigan, and Saulte Ste. Marietownship, in Chippewa County, both lumbering areas, which were French Canadian,voted heavily Democratic (78% and 67% in 1876, respectively). Also in Chippewa,on the other hand, Pickford, the English Canadian lumbering township, votedstrongly Republican in 1888 (only 36% Democratic), and Hiawatha township, inSchoolcraft County, also English Canadian and lumbering, voted only 22%Democratic in 1876.Among the Dutch, as we would now expect, the Catholics were strongly Democratic,racking up 94% of the vote in some precincts in 1876, while the Reformed werestrongly anti-Democratic, voting as low as 19%. The Dutch Reformed Church ofMichigan was less Calvinistic than one might expect. For in the 1830s inHolland, a pietistic “New Light” secession occurred in the Reformed Church, ledby Gijsbertus Voetius. Voetius stressed pietism and puritanical conduct andopposed a formal orthodox creed. A group of Voetius followers emigrated fromHolland to western Michigan in 1846, led by Albertus Christiaan Van Raalte. Bythe 1850s, however, a group of rather more traditional Calvinists broke off fromthe Van Raaltean Dutch Reformed Church and formed the “Christian” or “True”Reformed Church. As we might expect, while both groups of Dutch Reformed inMichigan were anti-Democratic, the Van Raalte faction was far more so. Thus, inOttawa County, a Dutch Protestant stronghold, the Dutch Reformed townships ofGeorgetown and Zeeland voted 38% and 33% Democratic in 1876. But Blendon andOliver townships, in the same county, which contained more Dutch ChristianReformed members, voted 46% Democratic in the same year.The “natives”—defined as the second generation of native born who generally hademigrated from New England or the Middle Atlantic states, tended to voteRepublican, but the proportions varied greatly—not by economic status or bystate of origin, but by the degree of pietism. The great exception is migrantsfrom the South, who tended to keep supporting their sectional loyalty and voteDemocratic. Here the Southern Presbyterians tended to be less stronglyDemocratic—and hence less tied to past struggles—than the Southern Baptists orthe Disciples of Christ. Among these “Old Stock” religious sects, highlypietistic New York Methodists, the Congregationalists, and the Free WillBaptists tended to be very strongly Republican, while the less pietistic andmore rationalistic Presbyterian was strongly Republican but not nearly asheavily. The lesser degree of support for Republicans among Presbyteriansreflected a split between the “Old School” and “United” Presbyterians, who werelargely liturgical, and the “New School” pietists. The two wings had formallyreunited in 1869, but the fundamental differences remained. For their part, theNew York Baptists were about evenly split—again reflecting the fragmentation ofBaptist sects between varying degrees of pietist or liturgical. Thus, the smallgroup of Free Will Baptists were ultra-pietist; as can be seen in the tablebelow. On the other hand, the Primitive Baptists were ultra-Calvinists, andtherefore liturgical. The far larger group of Regular Baptists were themselvesfragmented: most local churches being pietist and others (such as theLandmarkeans) being liturgical. The pietistic Quakers were strongly Republicanbut they, too, were divided. The Quakers from Pennsylvania, in Penn township,Cass County, Michigan, voted 41% Democratic in 1876 while the Quakers, who hadmoved from Pennsylvania to North Carolina, got fiercely involved in the fightagainst slavery, and then moved West, voted only 17% Democratic in Calvintownship of the same county.Within the Catholic groups, all were Democratic, but some were moreoverwhelmingly so than others. The Poles and Irish tended to be mostoverwhelmingly Democratic, followed slightly behind by the Germans, Dutch, andBohemians, and then by the French Acadians and “Old French” Catholics of Frenchextraction. The non-Catholic Bohemians, in contrast, tended to vote Republican.Paul Kleppner presents a ranked tabulation of the average Democratic votingpercentages of the religious groups in an illuminating way to summarize theabove conclusions. He divides them into “natives,” second-generation and olderstock native Americans, and “immigrants,” including actual immigrants andfirst-generation born in the United States. The table is as follows:Proportion Voting Democratic[20] [part0011.html#fn20] “Immigrant” ReligiousGroups “Native” Religious Groups Irish Catholics 95% Disciples of Christ 60%Polish Catholics 95% Southern Baptists 60% German Catholics 85% SouthernPresbyterians 55% Dutch Catholics 85% New York Baptists 45% Bohemian Catholics80% Presbyterians 30% French Canadians 75% Quakers 15% Old French 70%Congregationalists 10% German Lutherans 55% New York Methodists 10% GermanReformed 55% Free Will Baptists 5% Danish Lutherans 45% Dutch Christian Reformed45% German Sectarians 35% Dutch Reformed 30% Norwegian Lutherans 30% CornishMethodists 25% English Canadians 15% Swedish Lutherans 10% Irish Protestants 5%Welsh Methodists 5% Norwegian Haugeans 5%With the ethnoreligious demographics of the Midwest broken down, we can nowbegin to analyze the crucial political issues that consumed the region in thelate 1880s and early 1890s, which brings us one step closer towardsunderstanding the election of 1896.4. REFORM AND THE DRIVE FOR PROHIBITION[21] [part0011.html#fn21]We have pointed out that, in the early 1850s, the pietists had managed to outlawalcohol in 12 states. The leading Midwestern states—Illinois, Ohio, Michigan,Iowa, and Indiana—were among those who joined the drive, and the MinnesotaTerritory also outlawed liquor. In the resurgent drive for prohibition after theCivil War, the prohibitionists attempted to pass constitutional amendmentsoutlawing liquor in all the Midwestern states in the early 1880s. Added to thisdrive was a move for local option laws for prohibiting the saloon in numerouscounties, cities, and townships. As in most of the United States, Prohibitionwas the most vital issue in the Middle West during the 1880s.The Catholics, as we have indicated, were overwhelmingly opposed to Prohibition.There emerged within the Catholic Church, however, and among the Irish-Americanclergy, a quasi-pietistic movement akin to French Jansenism, which pervaded theFrench Church and had deeply influenced Irish seminarians studying in Francesince the 18th century. Led by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul, thispietistic movement stressed evangelistic missionary fervor as well as strictpersonal moral standards of behavior. Archbishop Ireland, while not in favor oftotal prohibition of alcohol, did take a quasi-prohibitionist stance: leading aCatholic temperance movement, condemning saloons, and urging local optionprohibition as well as very high license fees to be imposed on saloons. Ireland,in fact, was a founder of the Anti-Saloon League, which was to take the lead inthe drive for total prohibition. In his quasi-prohibitionist stance, Ireland wassupported by other neo-Jansenist bishops: including James Cardinal Gibbons ofBaltimore, Bishop John Spalding of Peoria, and Bishop John Keane of Dubuque. Healso found many adherents in the Paulist order. The neo-Jansenists formed theCatholic Total Abstinence Union, held Catholic retreats that were organized toclosely resemble pietistic Protestant revival meetings. With his beliefs, it isnot surprising that Archbishop Ireland was less than wholly devoted to theCatholic parochial schools, and was himself an ardent member and advocate of theRepublican Party.The pietistic softness on prohibition of this small circle of clerics had littleinfluence among the Irish Catholic masses, much less the Catholic voters ofother ethnic groups. Indeed, both the Germans and the Poles resented what theyconsidered to be Irish hegemony within the American Church. The Germans werebitter, also, about Archbishop Ireland and about what they considered to be aJansenistic trend and an underemphasis on liturgy in the American Church.Ireland they denounced as a “Puritan” Republican who was bent on“Protestantizing” the Catholic Church.The Protestant Episcopal Church was firmly anti-prohibitionist, particularly itsAnglican, or high-church, wing which was dominant in the Middle West. The onlyprohibitionists among them were in the far less liturgical, low-church minority.The views of the Anglicans on Prohibition were well expressed by Bishop CharlesC. Grafton of Fond du lac, Wisconsin. Puritanism, he declared, tries to lessenthe temptation to intemperance> by force, law, or prohibition. It is a judicial mode of dealing with a moral> problem. The Church looks rather to the aid of moral restraint, and to the aid> of grace. ... For great as is the evil of any fleshly sin, it often, by the> shame it brings, leads to repentance ... while on the other hand the spiritual> sins of pride, self-sufficiency ... are more deadly because unsuspected and> more lasting ...[22] [part0011.html#fn22]Among the Presbyterians, the more doctrinally oriented Calvinists tended to be“wets,” in favor of drinking in moderation. It should not be surprising that thehigh-church Episcopelians were mainly Democrats, while the low-church memberstended to support the Republican Party. An example was the leading wetPresbyterian minister from New York City, the Rev. Howard Crosby. The leadingCalvinist theologian in America, Charles Hodge of Princeton University, favoredthe use of more liturgy in the Presbyterian Church and was also bitterly opposedto Prohibition.Two leading Presbyterian laymen, who faced each other twice for the presidencyof the United States, reflected the differences within the Church in theirattitudes toward religion and politics. The outstanding Calvinistic Presbyterianattorney from Buffalo, Grover Cleveland, was the son of a Calvinist clergymen, aleading Democrat, a wet, and a bon vivant; the prim pietistic Benjamin Harrisonof Indiana was a dry and a leading Republican.As for the German Lutherans, the conservative and liturgical Missouri Synod, a“wet” group in favor of moderate drinking, spoke for many Liturgicals when itdenounced Prohibition as “directly adverse to the spirit, the method and the aimof Christian morals.” For the prohibitionist, “instead of relying on God’sspirit, ... puts his trust in fallible legislators ... the tricks andtreacheries of politicians.”[23] [part0011.html#fn23]The change in ethnoreligious demographic factors was crucial to the change inthe prohibition question, and hence the overall question of the Midwest.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0011.html#ft1] [Editor’s footnote] A condensed version of Chapters 4–6can be found in Rothbard, “A History of Money and Banking,” pp. 169–79.[2] [part0011.html#ft2] The Republicans, much less the Whigs, had no interest,however, in freeing the slaves in the South—only preventing an expansion ofslave labor into the Western territories.[3] [part0011.html#ft3] [Editor’s footnote] For a similar broad overview of thehistory of America’s libertarian tradition up to the Civil War, see MurrayRothbard, For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto, 2nd ed.

In thepresidential election of 1892, the Democrats gained 46% of the popular vote, andthe Republicans only 43%, with the rest going to minor parties. It looked as ifthe Democrats were on the threshold of becoming the dominant party in the UnitedStates. [Editor’s remarks] For the above statistics, see Paul Kleppner, TheCross of Culture: A Social Analysis of Midwestern Politics, 1850–1900 (New York:The Free Press, 1970), pp. 5–6.[5] [part0011.html#ft5] [Editor’s footnote] Some of the historians and theirworks Rothbard is referring to are Richard J.

They were a group ofpietist English descendants that lived in rural New England, upstate New York,Northern Ohio, Northern Indiana, and Northern Illinois, who were“postmillennialist” in that they believed the world must be improved for athousand years before Jesus would return to usher in the end of history. Inorder to bring about this “Kingdom of God,” the postmillennial pietists took itas their moral duty to stamp out the sin of others, even if it required thecoercive hand of government. Over time, these crusaders lost their religiouszeal and became “secularized,” but still maintained their enthusiasm forwielding state force. See Chapters 10, 11, and 13 below, pp. 295–99, 327–40,397–407, 420–36. See also Gary North, “Millennialism and the ProgressiveMovement,” Journal of Libertarian Studies 12 (Spring 1996): 121–42.[7] [part0011.html#ft7] Jensen, The Winning of the Midwest, p. 64.[8] [part0011.html#ft8] We are not trying to claim any apodictic certainty forthese causal connections. That is, it is perfectly possible to have pietists whoare consistent libertarians, or who are inconsistent between personal andeconomic liberty, and it is perfectly possible to have liturgicals who arestatists or who are inconsistent. All we are claiming is that this is what thecontrasting religious groups in America in the late 19th century believed, andthat this is how their belief system originated and developed. We are not makingany similar claims for any other time or place in world history. ([Editor’sremarks] For a prominent example of one such pietist libertarian described byRothbard, in which he explicitly cites the work of Kleppner and Jensen, seeMurray Rothbard, “Introduction” in Lysander Spooner: Libertarian Pietist, VicesAre Not Crimes [Cupertino, CA: Tanstaafl, 1977], pp. xiii–xvii).It should be noted, however, that the leadership on behalf of economic freedomand individual liberty taken by the British pietists in the 18th and 19thcenturies, as well as earlier, may be a bit deceiving. For these Dissenters orNonconformists were reacting against an established Anglican (liturgical)Church, and they would naturally favor religious liberty when confronting aState in opposition hands. It should also be pointed out that British Liberalismin that era was continually being split by the penchant of the Nonconformistmasses to be (a) in favor of Prohibition, and (b) in favor of crushing the IrishCatholics. In that way the Liberal party’s devotion to individual liberty wasrepeatedly undercut and comprised.[9] [part0011.html#ft9] [Editor’s footnote] Kleppner, The Cross of Culture, pp.71–91; Jensen, The Winning of the Midwest, pp. 58–88.[10] [part0011.html#ft10] [Editor’s footnote] The post-Civil War laissez-faireand hard money Democrats were known as the “Bourbons.” They were generallycentered in the Northeast, but were also in the Midwest. On the other hand,there were the much more statist and inflationist “Populist” Democrats, based inthe South and Far West. The Democratic upheaval in 1896 refers to the Populistfaction defeating the Bourbon Democracy and transforming the party from one thatchampioned laissez-faire to one that was much more supportive of governmentinterventionism.

THE ROAD TO DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPH1892 was the great year of resurgent Democratic triumph. It was the first timesince the Civil War that the Democratic Party controlled the presidency as wellas both Houses of Congress. The 3% difference in the popular vote (Democrats46%, Republicans 43%, and minor parties 11%) was by far the largest gap in thetotals since the Democratic presidential candidate Samuel Tilden swept thepopular vote in 1876. In the Middle West, the Republicans had carried all sixstates (Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) in 1888; now theDemocrats won three (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin), and almost tied in Ohio.The great shift in Democratic fortunes, however, had come two years earlier, inthe Congressional elections of 1890. Before 1890, the House of Representativeswas 51.1% Republican; after 1890, it was no less than 71% Democratic. TheDemocrats controlled nearly every large state. In the Middle West, theDemocratic peak in the House came in 1890, with slippage taking place in the1892 elections. Put another way, the Middle West in 1888 was a Republicanstronghold: of the six states (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Michigan, andWisconsin), the Republicans had six governors and the majority of fiveCongressional delegations. Only Indiana was a doubtful state. Yet, by 1889–1890,a spectacular reversal had taken place: nearly all the governors and all theCongressional delegations were Democratic.One partial explanation was the slight but steady decline in Republicanfortunes, and improvement in Democratic status, throughout this period. Thisrelative shift cannot be ascribed to shifts in the urban and rural electorate.It is true that the urban proportion of the electorate in the Middle West rosefrom 1870 to 1890, but the pattern of slight decline in Republican fortunesoccurred similarly in both urban and rural areas. The key to the changingfortunes was, as we have indicated, ethno-religious. The main key, as we shallsee below, was the liquor question, and the conflicting views on the issue heldby pietists and by liturgicals.[1] [part0012.html#fn1]In Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, for example, over the twenty year period therewas a marked decline in the Baptist and Methodist proportion of the electorateand a marked rise in Catholics and Lutherans, and among the Lutherans it was theGermans who were growing the most rapidly. By 1890, the Catholics were thelargest single religious group in the region. Part of the reason was a higherbirth rate among Catholics, both Irish and German; more important was the heavyimmigration during the 1870s and 1880s—an immigration in which the largest rolewas played by the Irish and German Catholics and Lutherans. This and other suchCatholic immigration, such as the Poles and Bohemians, far outstripped theimmigration of Scandinavian Lutherans.At its inception in the 1850s, the Republican Party, centering on opposition tothe expansion of slavery, was in that sense a moralistic party. It thereforeattracted other crusading groups, including Prohibitionists, strictSabbatarians, German anticlericals, and Know-Nothings who wished to curtail oreliminate foreign immigration.[2] [part0012.html#fn2] In short, it was pietismin politics, and hence, outside of the South, the Republican Party attracted theMethodists, Presbyterians, Norwegian Lutherans and Dutch Reformers. On the otherhand, the Democratic Party, as the traditional party of laissez-faire, attractedthe immigrant Catholics and German Lutherans.After the war, it seemed clear to knowledgeable politicians that the GermanLutherans were the swing vote, since the other religious groups were firm in oneparty or the other. By their quixotic choice in 1872 of the New York Republicanreformer and prohibitionist Horace Greeley for president—the epitome of thepietistic crusader—the Democrats totally alienated the German Lutherans and wentdown to a crushing defeat.[3] [part0012.html#fn3] As a result, the Democraticresurgence was postponed for another four years.Ohio and Wisconsin were conquered by the Republicans in 1872, but the partypromptly threw away its winning momentum. For in both states, the Republicansquickly enacted prohibition statutes under the pressure of the Women’s PrayerCrusade against alcohol. The reaction of the German Lutherans to this hatedprohibition was intense, as the Republicans lost both states in the elections ofthe following year (in Wisconsin, the Republican vote fell from 55% to 45% thefollowing year, while in Ohio the Republican poll fell from 53% to 48%).The Republican politicos then began the process of separating themselves fromthe bulk of their constituency in order to woo the German Lutheran swing vote.The risk was that their militancy would be angered and fall away from the causeor shift to minor parties. The maneuver was to woo the German Lutherans byplaying down Prohibition and Sunday blue laws, while stressing anti-Catholicismand opposition to subsidizing Catholic parochial schools with tax-supportedfunds. Thus, future president Rutherford B. Hayes won the Ohio gubernatorialrace in 1875 by at one and the same time bitterly attacking the Catholic“menace” to the public schools and, although denouncing liquor, also coming outagainst government-mandated prohibition.[4] [part0012.html#fn4] Similarly,Harrison Luddington, Republican nominee for governor of Wisconsin in 1875,stridently denounced the Catholics and public funds for parochial Catholicschools; at the same time, he scored heavily with the Lutherans for being theMayor of Milwaukee who refused to enforce that city’s prohibition law.On the other hand, part of the steady Republican decline during these decadesmay be attributed to the steady alienation of the ultra-pietist Republicans bythe leaders’ moderation on prohibition and Sabbath laws. We have seen that theRepublican decline in the 1870s and 1880s was greater than the Democraticincrease—the difference consisted of third-party defections from the Republicanranks, to such parties as the Greenbackers in the 1870s and later theProhibitionists. Apart from the ex-Southerners, the Greenbackers—crusaders forinflationary paper money—in the Midwest were ex-Republicans; in any case, theywere almost all pietists: Methodists, Baptists, and Norwegian and SwedishLutherans. There was hardly a Catholic or a German Lutheran amongst them.[5][part0012.html#fn5]During the 1880s, the Prohibitionist voters were almost all defectingRepublicans, including the Scandinavian Lutherans but above all the Methodists,Native, Welsh and Cornish.Despite these defections, the Republican leaders, seeing the rapid growth ofGerman Lutherans among the electorate, increasingly committed themselves to thepolicy of moderation on prohibition and Sabbatarian legislation. In Ohio, theRepublican Party was torn between the moderate policy of John Sherman andWilliam McKinley, and the strident prohibitionism of Joseph Foraker. It becameincreasingly clear during the 1880s that Foraker succeeded in his races forgovernor only when he moderated his prohibitionism and confined his pietistappeals to denouncing the Catholics for undermining the public schools. InDetroit, too, the Republican businessmen formed the Michigan Club in 1884 andcame to dominate Republican politics in the city. The Michigan Club turnedsharply away from Old Stock pietism and turned toward appealing to the immigrantGerman Lutherans. As a result, in 1890, the Republicans nominated an urban wetfor governor of Michigan after the Democrats, in a remarkable and ominous hintfor the future, had nominated an Old Stock pietistic dry.We come, then, to the question: why the great shift toward the Democrats in1890? In Ohio and Wisconsin, the reason was a massive shift of German Lutheransfrom the Republicans to the Democrats so much so as to carry Wisconsin forGrover Cleveland. Michigan, which will be discussed more in depth below, was anunusual case; here the 1890 shift toward the Democrats took place among nativeProtestants in southern Michigan, while Catholics strengthened their support forthe Democrats in the Upper Peninsula. The native Protestants were attracted bythe unusual Democratic nomination for governor of a pietistic dry. Two yearslater, however, the Democrats returned to their traditional nominating pattern;the native pietists went back to the Republicans, while the former Democratsreturned to their old party.[6] [part0012.html#fn6]Orthodox historians explain the massive rise in Democratic fortunes in 1890 toreaction against the high McKinley Tariff of that year. But, for one thing, theOhio shift came the year before, in 1889, and it has not been explained why theGerman Lutherans should suddenly get so upset about the protective tariff.Neither can the rise of the Populist Party in 1892 be said to have affected thisshift between the two major parties. Overall, the Populists attracted about asmany Democrats as Republicans, and they attracted far more Prohibitionists thaneither of the major parties. The inflationary and strongly pro-statist Populistswere basically a farmer party of native, British, Norwegian, and Swedishpietists. As a rural pietist party, it is no wonder that the bulk of its votershad been Prohibitionists.To explain the great Democratic rise in 1890, we must examine the situation invarious special states. Ohio, as we have seen, shifted strongly Democraticfirst, in 1889, largely because of the change in the German Lutheran vote. Theexplanation for this change is clear: an upsurge in prohibitionism.Ohio had never gone prohibitionist, thanks to the voting strength of theCincinnati Germans. The Republican drys had submitted a constitutional amendmentto outlaw liquor in 1883, but the voters had defeated the proposal. Failing toget a whole loaf, the prohibitionists decided on half: strict and expensivelicensing laws, particularly on saloons. In 1885, the Ohio legislature imposed astiff tax on liquor, and it followed in 1888 by raising the tax and byprohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sunday. The Ohio officials sagely failed toenforce the law in German areas. As a result, in the following year, theCincinnati Law and Order Association (known locally as the “EvangelicalStranglers”) petitioned Governor Foraker to enforce the law prohibiting the saleof liquor on Sunday.Foraker now harkened to his old prohibitionist faith. He accepted the petition,and he summarily removed the Cincinnati police board and appointed a new one toenforce the law. This action precipitated the “Saloon-Keepers’ Rebellion.”Saloon-keepers and liquor dealers organized a League for the Preservation ofCitizen’s Rights to combat the law. 300 German saloon-keepers resolved to stayopen on Sundays in defiance of the law. Not only in Cincinnati, but throughoutthe state, Law and Order Associations sprang up. They also supported GovernorForaker’s request for a constitutional amendment to allow the state to controlelection boards in cities and thereby to eliminate “corruption”—that is,victories by urban machine Democrats.In the fall elections in Ohio in 1889, the Democrats were silent on the liquorlaws for fear of alienating their Southern Baptist and Disciples of Christsupporters. They did call, however, for Home Rule for the Ohio cities, whichwould have meant non-enforcement of the law in German areas. The League for thePreservation of Citizen’s Rights called for the repudiation of Governor Foraker,who was seeking a third term. All this was enough to induce a massive swing ofGerman Lutherans into the Democratic camp, and Democratic Representative JamesCampbell won the election for governor.In the presidential election of 1892, in which the Democrats almost tied theRepublicans, the Democrats were able to keep some of the German Lutherans whohad defected three years earlier. The remainder of the gain over 1888 came froma defection of many Republican pietists to the Prohibitionist ranks, a defectionspurred by the current dominance of the moderate McKinley faction in theRepublican Party of Ohio. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, for example, theMcKinley group had dropped the idea of enforcing the Sunday closing law.It is instructive to see how the Democrats, led in the press by the CincinnatiEnquirer, were able to argue for the libertarian Democratic positions in thepresidential race in 1892 by linking them up to the struggle over prohibitionthree years earlier. Thus, the major national issues were the Democratic attackon the protective McKinley Tariff, and on the Republican Force Bill, a finalattempt to bring back Reconstruction and impose Federal supervision ofCongressional elections in the South. On the tariff, the Democrats linked thegovernmental paternalism of the tariff to the paternalism of prohibition. On theForce Bill, the Democrats could link it with prohibition by denouncing in bothcases the Republican assault on home rule and local government, by attempting inboth cases to centralize power in the hands of “Republican fanatics,” and tosuppress individual liberty. In both cases, the issue was liberty againstPuritan meddling and paternalism.For their part, the Republicans, while countering with their habitual stance asthe “party of morality,” raised a more moderate note by attacking the defectorsto the Prohibition Party and other minor parties as “cranks” and “meddlingprohibitionists.” It was in this unwonted tone of attack upon moral crusadingthat the Republicans anticipated their momentous shift of policy four yearslater.Even the seemingly well entrenched Representative William McKinley had beennarrowly beaten in the Democratic landslide by German defectors. Rapidlymoderating his stand on prohibition, McKinley was able to buck the Democratictide by defeating Governor Campbell in 1891, sweeping in a Republicanlegislature as well. Not only was McKinley the long-time leader of the moderateson pietistic issues, but he was also shrewd enough to reverse his previouspro-inflation and pro-silver stand—in short, to adopt the sort of pro “soundmoney” and gold standard position previously associated with the DemocraticParty. This was particularly effective against Governor Campbell, who had comeout for free silver. As a result, Ohio was almost the only major state where theRepublicans did well in 1891.1889 was also an ominous year for the Republicans in Indiana. In Indianapolis,in the fall of that year, a group of wealthy Republicans and pietistic ministersorganized the High-License League of Indianapolis, dedicated to raising theannual license fee for saloons. In response, the Republican administrationraised the fee from $100 to $250. As a result, the Democrats swept Indianapolisin a triumphant coalition including businessmen opposed high taxes, classicalliberals, and anti-prohibitionist Germans.[7] [part0012.html#fn7]In Wisconsin too, the Democrats swept the state in 1890, due largely to amassive shift of German Lutherans from the Republican ranks. Two years later,the Democrats retained enough of these defectors to enable them to carryWisconsin for the presidency.Wisconsin, with the exception of two years, had been controlled by theRepublicans ever since the Civil War. The exception was 1872–73, when a stiffsaloon licensing law, put through by the Republicans, shifted enough Germans outof the Republican ranks to carry the state for the Democrats. The Republicans,under the shrewd leadership of “Boss” Elisha Keyes and Philetus Sawyer, thenrefused to enforce the licensing laws and thereby were swept back into power.The critical issue in Wisconsin, however, turned out to be not prohibition butanother pietist-liturgical conflict: the status of parochial schools. After theRepublicans had absorbed the lesson in moderation for many years, the newRepublican governor in 1889, William Dempster Hoard, recommended the enforcementof a dead letter compulsory education law requiring the language of all schools,public or private, to be in English.In response, the Wisconsin legislature, in the spring of 1889, passed thenotorious Bennett Law, which (1) imposed compulsory attendance for children inschool, and (2) decreed that the language of such a school, whether public orprivate, could only be in English. This meant, in the concrete, that anyGerman-language schools would henceforth be illegal. The Bennett Law hit hardnot only at the German Catholic parochial schools, but also at theGerman-language parochial schools operated by the Lutheran churches. TheWisconsin Synod, which ran 164 parochial schools in the state, one-third ofwhich used only English, denounced the law as “oppressive and tyrannical” andattacked its encroachment on “parental rights and family life.” The MissouriSynod, which ran 136 German-language parochial schools, attacked the law forviolating the “natural rights of parents” and their liberty of conscience.At the end of December, the German Lutherans set up a state committee to combatthe Bennett Law. In February, 19 Lutheran congregations in Milwaukee made repealof the Bennett Law the crucial political issue. The three Catholic bishops ofWisconsin, all Germans, also attacked the law as interfering “with the rights ofthe Church and of the parent.” The German-language press linked the law tonativism and prohibitionism, and the Lutherans and Catholics were angered stillfurther by the fact that some of the hated German anticlerical liberals—alongwith the German pietist groups—favored the despotic law.As a consequence, in the Milwaukee municipal election of 1890, an election thattook place before the passage of the protectionist McKinley Tariff, theDemocrats overthrew the Republican mayor. The cause of this landslide in thefirst real Democratic victory in Milwaukee in fifteen years was a massivedefection to the Democrats in the German Lutheran wards, aided by a furtherstrengthening of Democratic support in German Catholic areas. In consequence,the Republican vote in Milwaukee, which had been 47% in 1888, now felldrastically to 30%. The Democratic nominee, the affable Yankee humorist GeorgePeck, had denounced the Bennett Law in no uncertain terms as unjust, andinfringing on the natural liberty of conscience and the natural right ofparental control.In May, a group of leading Wisconsin Lutherans called a state-wide anti-BennettLaw convention for June. The convention was addressed by George Peck, the newDemocratic mayor of Milwaukee. Scores of Anti-Bennett Law Clubs burgeonedthroughout Wisconsin. The Missouri Synod and allied Lutherans organizedsystematically in every parish against the law. The German Catholics wereequally bitter; Archbishop Katzen of Green Bay declared that “as Bishop of thisDiocese [I] should consider anyone who did not vote for repeal of the [Bennett]law a traitor to the Catholic Church.”[8] [part0012.html#fn8]In August, the Democratic state platform denounced the Bennett Law, andintelligently linked it to other examples of Republican paternalism, state andfederal: to the sumptuary laws, high spending, the protective tariff, the ForceBill, and centralization of power. The Democrats were also aided in publicopinion by the fact that the Prohibitionist Party, thoroughly hated by allGerman Catholics and Lutherans, endorsed the Bennett Law in its 1890 platform.In the Republican Party, two conflicting groups appeared. The dominant faction,headed by Governor William Dempster Hoard, ardently favored the Bennett Law. TheHoard faction, which included Representatives Nils Haugen and Robert M. LaFollette, demanded a part declaration in support of the law, in the name ofadherence to “principle.” The Hoard faction had its way at the state conventionand won the re-nomination of Governor Hoard. The Hoard group were responding tolocal pietist pressures, to anti-Catholicism, and to a drive by the WisconsinDairymen’s Association, of which Hoard was a member, to teach more English tothe state’s farmers. Haugen, a Norwegian immigrant, represented a highlypietistic region in the west and northwest of the state, consisting mainly ofNorwegians and Swedes. La Follette also came from a heavily pietistic area.The minority moderates, headed by State Chairman Henry C. Payne and U.S. SenatorJohn C. Spooner, tried in vain to dump Governor Hoard and to call openly forrepeal of the Bennett Law. They were responding to the massive defectionunderway from Republican ranks by the German Lutherans. Governor Hoard, anintensely pietistic newspaper owner and an amateur in politics, did not easematters by bitterly denouncing German parents and pastors and endorsing theBennett Law to the hilt.In the November, 1890 elections, the German Lutherans reacted by shifting enmasse to the Democratic camp; the Republicans were crushed by what was called atthe time the “Lutheran Landslide.” Even the faithfully Republican and slightlyliturgical Norwegian Synod Lutherans deserted the Republican camp, not by votingfor the hated Democrats but by staying away from the polls. The Norwegian Synodhad established Norwegian-language parochial schools, and even the pietisticNorwegians and Swedes—especially the recent immigrants—were embittered by theattack on their home tongues.As a result, Governor Hoard was smashed by the Democrat George Peck. To theHoard campaign slogan, “The Little Schoolhouse, STAND BY IT!” the Democrats hadcountered, “Peck and ALL the Schools!” The Bennett Law was promptly repealed,with half of the Republican legislators joining the Democrats in the vote. By1892, while many German Lutherans returned to the Republican ranks, enoughstayed Democratic to carry the state for Cleveland.[9] [part0012.html#fn9]The Bennett Law was modelled after the Edwards Law passed in Illinois in 1889,and pushed through by the State Superintendent of public instruction, RichardEdwards. The reaction in Illinois was very similar. The Germans, even includingthe anticlerical liberals, rallied to defend the right of instruction in theGerman language. The Republican Party came out strongly for the public schools,as well as for prohibition, and they re-nominated Edwards for superintendent.The Democrats, in contrast, called for repeal of the Edwards law, as violatingthe natural rights of parents. With the Edwards law as well as prohibition andSunday closing laws as the crucial issues in Illinois, the Democrats were ableto win the state, to capture Cook County, and to recapture the city of Chicago.The hated Edwards was defeated handily by the Democratic candidate Henry Raab.In 1892, the Democratic momentum continued. Grover Cleveland was the firstDemocrat since the Civil War to carry the state of Illinois, sweeping CookCounty by 33,000 votes and carrying in the Democratic candidate forgovernor.[10] [part0012.html#fn10]In Michigan, the voting pattern in 1890 was unusual. In the Upper Peninsula, theDemocrats gained strength among Catholics and lost votes among Protestants. Thereason was that, culturally, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was really anextension of northeastern Wisconsin, and so the educational agitation for andagainst the Bennett Law deeply affected opinion there. In particular, FrenchCanadian Catholics strengthened their devotion to the Democrats, while EnglishCanadian Protestants became even more Republican. The conflict over the BennettLaw in Wisconsin had polarized the Upper Peninsula even more than before.The political situation in southern Michigan was particularly odd. TheRepublican moderates, coming to dominate politics in the state, as we have seen,decided to reject a typical pietist farmer for governor and instead nominated anurban wet, James M. Turner, mayor of Lansing. In response, the MichiganDemocracy nominated for governor Edwin B. Winans, a prohibitionist Old Stockfarmer. The result was that in southern Michigan many Catholics defected to theRepublicans, while many more angry Republican pietists failed to vote orsupported the Prohibitionist Party. The result was a large defection fromRepublican ranks and a Democratic victory in the state.Two years later, however, the parties reverted to type: the Democrats returnedto their traditional nominating pattern, the defecting Catholics returned, andthe large number of defecting pietists returned to Republican ranks. This meantthat Michigan reverted, in 1892, to its pre-1890 status as a solid Republicanstate.[11] [part0012.html#fn11]Iowa was another state in which the Republicans were overturned by theprohibition issue. Iowa had always been totally controlled by the RepublicanParty. In 1855, the pietistic Whigs had passed a constitutional amendmentprohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcohol. The Republicans, concentratingon slavery as the major issue, promptly exempted beer and wine from the ban,permitted local option, and didn’t enforce the law in counties opposed to it.After the Civil War, the Republicans began to succumb to intense pressure by theprohibitionists. The W.C.T.U., the Sons of Temperance, and the Order of GoodTemplars spread the dry gospel, and the Prohibitionist Party was formed, withthe Methodists leading the pietistic sects in the new crusade. In Iowa, the drypolitical pressure was led by the Iowa State Temperance Alliance.Throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s, the drys were able to pass ever morestringent licensing and local option laws. At the Republican convention of 1875,a coalition of dry and inflationist pietists almost gained the gubernatorialnomination for their leader, General James B. Weaver, later to be a Populistpresidential candidate. Four years later, the drys finally captured theRepublican Party in Iowa, which voted to push for an amendment to the stateconstitution which would join Maine and Kansas as the only totallyprohibitionist states in the Union. The Prohibitionist Party in the statecollapsed, for its members hastened to join the Republicans.The climax came in June 1882, when the Iowa public voted on a prohibitionamendment after it was twice recommended by a Republican dominated legislature.The Temperance Alliance mobilized men and women in every part of the state,calling for prohibition in the name of Christian morality and Americancivilization.The Democrats denounced the prohibitionists as “puritanical fanatics” trying toimpose sumptuary laws and aggressing the liberty of the individual. TheDemocrats colorfully denounced the Republicans as “the tool of fanaticalpreachers,” and as heading a “Holy Alliance of ... abolitionists, Whigs,Know-Nothings, Sunday and Cold Water Fanatics.”[12] [part0012.html#fn12]But the opposition was in vain. The prohibition amendment passed by 55% to 45%,by a margin of 30,000 votes. One immediate and lasting result of the vote wasthe enraging of the German population of Iowa. Before 1882, the fourteenmost-heavily German counties of Iowa habitually voted 55% Republican. Aftervoting 39% for the dry referendum, the Republican percentage in these Germancounties fell permanently to the 36–44% range.The same defection of German Catholics can be seen in the changed votingpatterns of the heavily Catholic city of Dubuque. 50% Republican in 1881,Dubuque dropped to 28% Republican in the fall 1882 reelections (after voting 15%dry in the referendum) and picked up to only 38% in 1885. Particularly strikingwere two German wards: Ward 3, which fell from 51% Republican in 1881 to 23% thefollowing year (after voting 10% dry), and Ward 5, which dropped from 63% to 22%Republican (after voting 6% dry).The next winter, however, the Iowa Supreme Court invalidated the amendment on aprocedural error. The Republicans, seeing the firestorm of opposition, did notdare to resubmit the amendment. To mollify the pietists, the Republicanscontinued to widen the scope of prohibition by statute. In 1884, the Republicansrammed through one of the stiffest prohibition laws in the country. In towns andvillages where sentiment was dry, saloons were forced to close. But in thelarger towns and cities, the law was openly flouted.At first, the laws were poorly enforced in wet areas. But in 1887 and 1888,Governor William Larrabee decided to enforce the law to the hilt and morerestrictive laws were passed. Informers were given bonuses for revealing theexistence of illicit liquor. The officials conducted raids on people suspectedof harboring illegal alcohol.The furor over prohibition reached a peak in Iowa during 1889. A massiveflouting of the prohibition laws had polarized sentiment in the state betweenrepeal of prohibition and inflicting ever harsher punishments in order toenforce the law. At the Republican state convention, control was seized from theprofessionals by the eager ultra-pietist amateurs, who had packed countyconventions with radical prohibitionists. Joseph Hutchinson, an amateurpolitician and wholesale grocer, was nominated for governor; he delivered apaean to prohibition, calling it a “struggle for morality, for the reduction ofcorruption ... for the true elevation of the human race.”[13][part0012.html#fn13] Hutchinson made it clear that the fundamental choice beforethe voter was between modern civilization on the one hand, and that “cursedbarracuda,” the saloon, on the other.The prohibitionists and pietists enthusiastically backed Hutchinson,particularly the W.C.T.U., the Good Templars, and the Methodist Church, whichdemanded the unconditional surrender of liquor, as well as the repudiation ofsuch halfway measures as licensing and local option. The Methodists also calledfor the outlawing of all desecration of the Sabbath, including ball games, thepublishing of newspapers, and railroad service.For their part, the Democrats shrewdly selected for governor Horace Boies, aformer Republican, a personal teetotaler, and even a member of the GoodTemplars, but who staunchly opposed prohibition, centralized power, andpaternalistic government. Boies, however, did favor local option and highlicense fees for saloons.Horace Boies became the first Democrat ever to become governor of Iowa since theCivil War, obtaining 50% of the vote to Hutchinson’s 48%. The following year,the Democrats gained the majority of the Iowa Congressional delegation.Analyzing the composition of the drop in the Republican vote, from 52% in 1888to 48% the following year, it becomes clear that the major transformation camein the cities. In 1888, out of nine cities in Iowa with 14,000 or morepopulation, the Democrats carried four, with an overall total of 52% of theurban vote. But the following year, Horace Boies swept all nine, with a massive64% of the vote.Breaking down the vote by religion, while Old Stock towns and counties,Norwegian, Swedish, and Bohemian townships slightly lowered the proportion ofthe Republican vote; the biggest Republican losses were in the nine German urbanwards, the vote falling from 28% to 15%.The drys also exercised control over the 1891 Republican convention, calling fortotal prohibition, and shouting down the possibility of local option. TheDemocratic slate, however, continuing to attack prohibition, swept to victory ina remarkably high voter turnout; and Governor Boies won reelection, handing theRepublicans their worst defeat in the history of Iowa.The Republicans had learned their lesson. Two years later, in the 1893convention, the Republican pros were able to take back their party from theenthusiastic amateur drys. The successful comeback was headed by former SenatorJames Harlan, the founder and Grand Old Man of the Iowa Republican Party, andhimself a devout Methodist and temperance man. The professional forces managedto carry repeal of the 12-year Republican commitment to total prohibition and tobury the compulsory education issue as well. Instead, local option and highlicense fees for liquor were installed in the platform. To win back the Germanvoters, staunch opponents of cheap money and inflation, the Iowa Republicanseven abandoned their cheap money plank and adopted an anti-inflation stance.Armed with their new-found moderation, the Republicans were able to recapturethe governorship that year on behalf of the moderate Frank Jackson.[14][part0012.html#fn14]2. THE REPUBLICANS REGROUPA. THE RETREAT FROM PROHIBITIONAs the Republicans slipped into becoming the minority party in state after statein the early 1890s, it became increasingly clear to their political leaders thatsomething drastic would have to be done; notably, radically pietist measureswould have to be soft-pedalled so as not to aggravate the German Lutherans andother liturgical voters. We have seen how in response to Democratic victories,the Republicans in Ohio and Iowa moved quickly to soften or jettison theirprohibitionist platform; in both states, furthermore, the Republicans began toshift from their previous inflationist and pro-silver stance toward the advocacyof the gold standard and sound money. In Wisconsin, they were willing tobacktrack on the Bennett Law and its assault on German parochial schooling.In this move toward jettisoning their pietist doctrines, the lead was taken bythe Ohio Republican leadership of Governor William McKinley, and his mentor andparty boss, chairman of the Ohio and later the national Republican Party, theindustrialist Marcus Alonzo Hanna. In his term as governor, from 1892 to 1896,McKinley succeeded in suppressing the pietists in the Ohio party. And then, whenJoseph Foraker returned to control the party that year, the prohibitionistsfound to their chagrin that their old champion had learned his lesson too, andthat Foraker was now a determined wet.In Wisconsin, former Governor Hoard tried a comeback by promoting such ardentpietists and prohibitionists as Representative Nils Haugen and thenRepresentative Robert La Follette as governor. The Republican professional,however, finally beat out Haugen and La Follette in the 1890s, and eliminatedthe old Republican lust for moral crusading. In Michigan, the leading Republicanpietist was the mayor of Detroit, Hazen Pingree. During the 1890s, the stateRepublican machinery, led by Senator James McMillan, maneuvered hard to limit oreliminate Pingree’s influence, finally succeeding in saving the GOP in Michiganfrom reacquiring a strongly pietist image. In Illinois and Indiana, in themeantime, the Republican moderates were able to defeat the pietists withcomparative ease.The Republicans were thus retreating en masse from prohibitionist and pietistconcerns during the early 1890s. No major Republican newspaper endorsed totalprohibition; the furthest they would go was regulation, high license fees, andlocal option. The Republican politicians increasingly avoided the vexed issuealtogether, calling it a purely local matter. The veteran Ohio RepublicanSenator John Sherman went so far as to assert that matters of religion,morality, and temperance should not be political issues. A far cry from the old“party of great moral ideas.” Another disillusioning situation for theprohibitionists is that the great bulk of Republican politicians themselvesimbibed alcohol. How then could they be trusted?The tension between the Republicans and their pietist constituents was alsogrowing to the bursting point because, while the Republicans were becoming moremoderate, the prohibitionists were becoming increasingly fanatical. Originally,the prohibitionists had habitually referred to themselves as temperate, as menof temperance. By the 1880s and 1890s, however, this was no longer true: theprohibitionists now spoke of themselves as “radicals.” It was no longer enoughto attack hard liquor; denunciations of beer were now stepped up. The salooncame in for increasing vilification, violent raids were conducted on them, andLaw and Order Legions in large cities acted to stamp out illegal sales ofliquor. By 1885, there were 500 such local leagues throughout the country, with60,000 members.Not only that: the youth were becoming more pietistic and more militantprohibitionists than their elders. The pietist youth exuded a deep hatred forthe saloons, expressed through Young People’s Christian Societies andinterdenominational Sunday school programs. The W.C.T.U., partly through itshighly successful mandatory temperance hygiene classes in the public schools,were able to enlist 200,000 youngsters in their youth affiliate, the LoyalTemperance Legion.The success in radicalizing middle-class pietist youth is shown by the fact that2/3 of all college students in the Midwest were enrolled in pietistdenominations, and that most of them joined the highly moralistic Young Men’sChristian Association. The faculty and students at Iowa State Universityendorsed prohibition. Particularly remarkable was a presidential preference pollof undergraduates at the University of Chicago in 1892. The eventual winner,Democrat Grover Cleveland, obtained 52 votes, while incumbent RepublicanPresident Benjamin Harrison received 151 votes, and the Populist James B. Weaverobtained 3. But the astounding fact is that the winner of the poll was theProhibitionist Party candidate, John Bidwell, who received 164 votes.But what was an increasingly militant prohibitionist constituency going to dopolitically in the face of growing Republican reluctance and a decliningProhibitionist Party? The Prohibitionist Party foundered on the question of asingle issue on alcohol versus a broad-range pietist, genuine third-partyorganization. A similar split led to the collapse of the anti-Catholic AmericanProtective Association, which could not decide in 1896 whether to endorseMcKinley for president or to establish a third political party of its own. Theupshot was the gradual disappearance of the Prohibitionist movement as a groupof enthusiastic amateurs and its replacement by an extremely effective andprofessional single-issue lobby, the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893. TheAnti-Saloon League, willing to concentrate first on local option laws and tobuild up steadily from there, rewarded or punished politicians purely on thesingle issue of alcohol. Its tactic was to triumph in a quarter-century.[15][part0012.html#fn15]B. RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION[16] [part0012.html#fn16]The Republicans were fully aware that the secular demographic trend, fueled bythe arrival of Catholic and other liturgical immigrants, was against them.During the 1880s, while British and Scandinavian immigration had reached newhighs, they were surpassed by German and Irish immigration, the latter being thehighest since the famous influx of the late 1840s and early 1850s. During thesame decade, the “new immigration” from southern and eastern Europe, especiallyCatholics from Italy, began to make its mark.Their defeat in the presidential election of 1892 intensified the hatred ofCatholics and Catholic immigrants in the Republican Party. The predecessors ofthe Republicans, the Whigs, had been strongly nativist and anti-Catholic, andthe short-lived Know-Nothings, from whose ranks many Republicans had emerged inthe mid-1850s, flourished on an exclusively anti-immigrant and anti-Catholicprogram. Now the embittered Republicans turned to a policy of immigrationrestriction. If the Catholics could not constitutionally be deported, they couldat least be prevented from tipping the balance further.The first break in the American tradition of free and unrestricted immigrationcame in the act of 1882, when the federal government assumed at least formalcontrol over immigration (previously regulated by the states, principally NewYork).[17] [part0012.html#fn17] The United States, instead of the severalstates, was to tax each entrant a modest fifty cents to accumulate an immigrantwelfare fund, and ex-convicts or other people likely to become a public chargewere to be denied admission.In the late 1880s, working class activists, concerned with restricting thesupply of incoming labor, obtained legislation in several states barring aliensfrom various types of employment. In particular, aliens were prohibited fromemployment on public works. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in1886 banning “nondeclarant” aliens (those who had not yet declared theirintentions of becoming U.S. citizens) from employment on public works. When theSenate failed to pass the bill, Illinois, Wyoming, and Idaho proceeded to barsuch aliens from state or municipal works projects.More sweepingly, in 1885, the Knights of Labor and other working class groupspersuaded the Congress to outlaw contract labor, the system under which aEuropean immigrant was assured of a specific job in the U.S. before he arrived.The outlawing of contract labor, of course, tended to increase those immigrantslikely to become a public charge and thereby added further to the restriction onimmigration.[18] [part0012.html#fn18]In addition to workers attempting to restrict immigrant competition, thepietists and prohibitionists centered on the Catholic immigrants as their majorfoe. Thus, the Presbyterian Synod of 1887 declared:> The ranks of the drinking men are constantly recruited by the influx of> bibulous and intemperate foreigners. The great majority of these alien> immigrants, now over a half million annually, are addicted to the case of> strong drinks, as well as steeped in ignorance and vice.And the Reverend T.W. Cuyler, president of the National Temperance Society, putit even more strongly in the summer of 1891: “How much longer [will] theRepublic ... consent to have her soil a dumping ground for all Hungarianruffians, Bohemian bruisers, and Italian cutthroats of every description?”[19][part0012.html#fn19]Immigration restrictions were sought by the Independent Presbyterians, theNational Temperance Convention in 1891, and the Prohibition Party in 1892. Thelate 1880s saw a blossoming of nativist and anti-Catholic organizationsagitating to restrict immigration. The large Civil War veterans’ organization,the Grand Army of the Republic, long associated with the Republican Party andnow reaching its peak membership of 400,000, began to denounce immigrants whowere allying themselves politically with “copperheads and ex-rebels,” i.e., withSoutherners in the Democratic Party.[20] [part0012.html#fn20]Patriotic secret societies, nativist and anti-Catholic, led by the newlyburgeoning Junior Order of United American Mechanics, with 60,000 members in1889 and 160,000 in the 1890s, began to flourish in the late 1880s. Other suchfraternal orders, all founded in Pennsylvania, were the Order of United AmericanMechanics and the Patriotic Order Sons of America.Also newly active was a group of secret anti-Catholic societies, including theUnited Order of Deputies, with fifteen thousand working-class members, whodemanded that employers discharge all Catholics. By far the leadinganti-Catholic organization was the American Protective Association, founded inClinton, Iowa in 1887 by attorney Henry F. Bowers. A.P.A. members took secretoaths never to vote for a Catholic or to employ one if a Protestant wereavailable.The A.P.A. grew steadily across the upper Mississippi Valley, especially inlarge towns and cities where Catholics were prevalent. The A.P.A. helped theRepublicans sweep the ordinarily Democratic city of Omaha in 1891, and thefollowing year it elected a Congressman from Saginaw, Michigan. Acquiring 70,000members by 1893, the A.P.A. suddenly burgeoned to a mammoth half a millionmembers the following year, centering in the Midwest but also stretchingeastward through the Great Lakes area.The A.P.A. was almost exclusively Republican. It aided McKinley’s reelection asOhio governor in 1893, and in Michigan, Kentucky, and Nebraska, the organizationwas close to the Republican Party leadership.Thus, the Republican Party had considerable incentive to push for immigrationrestriction in the late 1880s and early 1890s: both in response to the pietismof its constituents and in reaction to the growing demographic dominance of theimmigrant-sustained Democratic Party. But there was also another powerfulreason: the Republicans might moderate most of their formerly cherished pietism,but there was one overriding plank to which they were deeply committed: theprotective tariff. The pro-tariff manufacturers decided that to gain the supportof the working classes against the powerful Democratic assault on the tariff asa special privilege, the Republicans should offer the native workers a quid proquo: protection of their foreign competitors, the immigrants. In that way, themanufacturers’ privileges and cartels sustained by the tariff would be sweetenedby cartelization of the labor force to restrict entry into the work force.[21][part0012.html#fn21] The idea of such a bargain in mutual special privilege wasparticularly pushed by James M. Swank, general manager of the American Iron andSteel Association. It is no coincidence that the inefficient iron and steelindustry had led the drive for a protective tariff from its earliest days, afterthe War of 1812, until the end of the century.By the late 1880s, the Republicans stepped up their agitation for therestriction of immigration. Republican conventions in Pennsylvania and Ohio in1887, as well as in California the following year, came out for restriction.Senator Justin Morrill, Republican of Vermont, a veteran protectionist andadvocate of federal intervention in education, introduced a bill for immigrationrestriction in 1887. Three years later, Congress moved toward legislativeaction. Senator William E. Chandler, Republican of New Hampshire, becamechairman of the Senate’s first standing committee on immigration in 1890 andthereby assumed the lead of the restrictionist movement. The following year,Congress assumed sole jurisdiction over immigration and put teeth in existingrestrictions on entry by compelling steamship companies to carry back allimmigrants rejected by U.S. inspectors. This law had a chilling effect on thewillingness of steamship companies to carry immigrants to the U.S. The act of1891 also provided, for the first time, for deporting illegal aliens within oneyear of entry, or for deporting aliens who might become public charges “fromcauses existing prior to his landing.” The act also added to the categories ofthe excluded polygamists and those with a “loathsome and dangerous” contagiousdisease. The ban on contract labor was also broadened by adding those immigrantsencouraged to arrive by employer advertisements.The restrictionists in Congress, led by Chandler’s committee, attempted to takeadvantage of a cholera scare in the fall of 1892, to pass a moratorium on allimmigration for an entire year. They were not successful in stampeding Congress,however.Failing the suspension, the restrictionists, led by Chandler and byRepresentative Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, drove toward a literacy testfor all immigrants. The restrictionists’ hand was strengthened by the fallelections in 1894, which installed Republican majorities in both houses ofCongress. At the same time, the Immigration Restriction League was founded inBoston by a half-dozen young Brahmins. The League spread a nationwide propagandaand Washington lobbying critical of the new immigration from southern andeastern Europe, which allegedly contained a host of illiterates and criminals.In the winter of 1895, the Immigration Restriction League’s bill was introducedand spearheaded by now-Senator Lodge and by Representative Walker McCall ofMassachusetts. The bill provided for the exclusion of all men and women over theage of 14 who could not read and write. Lodge and McCall stressed racialarguments against the Italians and other southern Europeans. The literacy billpassed the House overwhelmingly during 1896, and the Senate in December. ButPresident Cleveland, in one of his last acts in office, vetoed the bill, and theSenate failed to override.In addition to restricting entry, the nativists could do something about thevoting rights of immigrants already in the United States. Restrictionists urgeda lengthening of the waiting period for naturalization. Moreover, eighteensouthern and western states allowed aliens to vote on a simple declaration ofintent to become a citizen. The nativists began a trend back to the originalAmerican prohibition of alien suffrage, but by the end of the century 11 statesstill allowed aliens to vote.[22] [part0012.html#fn22]C. PIETISM AND WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE[23] [part0012.html#fn23]Voting need not only be restricted; it could also be expanded, provided thatpietists would hope to benefit more than proportionately. Specifically, womencould be granted the vote, in the knowledge that immigrant Catholic women wouldnot be likely to vote in as great proportions as native-born WASPs. As ProfessorGrimes concludes:> I am ... arguing that the evidence indicates that to a large extent, at least> in the West, the constituency granting woman suffrage was composed of those> who also supported prohibition and immigration restriction and felt woman> suffrage would further their enactment.[24] [part0012.html#fn24]Like most reform movements, such as prohibition, the women’s suffrage movementwas heavily pietist from the very beginning. The strongly pietist third parties,such as the Prohibition Party and the Greenback Party, supported women’ssuffrage throughout, and the Populists tended in that direction before theiramalgamation into the Democracy in 1896. Later, the Progressive Party of 1912was the first major national convention to permit women delegates and to selecta woman elector. Of the two major parties, the Democrats paid no attention tothe women suffrage question, while the Republicans made vague noises in afavorable direction. The suffragettes saw as their major enemies the partybosses of the Republican and especially the Democratic parties, and inparticular the liquor interests, who, in the words of the philippic by Susan B.Anthony and Ida H. Harper, were “positively, unanimously, and unalterablyopposed to woman suffrage.”[25] [part0012.html#fn25]Perhaps one reason for this determined opposition was the great prominence inthe suffragette movement of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, founded in1874, upon the pledge: “I hereby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstainfrom all distilled, fermented and malt liquors, including wine, beer and cider,and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in thesame.” The W.C.T.U., led by Frances E. Willard, had, by 1900, establishedchapters in 10,000 towns and cities across the country and enjoyed a membershipof 300,000. Of all women’s organizations mentioned in Anthony and Harper’sHistory of Woman Suffrage, the W.C.T.U. received the greatest amount of space.That they were also involved in curfew, anti-gambling, anti-smoking, andanti-sex laws—actions lauded by the woman suffrage movements—is clear from thefollowing passage in Anthony and Harper:> [The W.C.T.U.] has been a chief factor in State campaigns for statutory> prohibition, constitutional amendment, reform laws in general and those for> the protection of women and children in particular, and in securing> anti-gambling and anti-cigarette laws. It has been instrumental in raising the> “age of protection” for girls in many States, and in obtaining curfew laws in> 400 towns and cities. ... The association protests against the legalization of> all crimes, especially those of prostitution and liquor selling.[26]> [part0012.html#fn26]Not only did Susan B. Anthony begin her career as a professional prohibitionist,but her two successors as president of the leading suffragette organization, theNational American Woman Suffrage Association, were also ardent prohibitionists.Her immediate successor, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, also began as aprohibitionist, while the next president, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, began her careeras a lecturer for the W.C.T.U.[27] [part0012.html#fn27]The Women’s Christian Temperance Union crystallized out of an anti-liquor“Women’s Prayer Crusade” that began in Hillsboro, Ohio in 1874, and swept thenation. As Eleanor Flexner put it: “Bands of singing, praying women heldmeetings, not only in churches but on street corners, penetrating into thesaloons themselves and closing them by the thousands.”[28] [part0012.html#fn28]When the effort fizzled, a permanent organization the W.C.T.U. was establishedin Cleveland to carry on the anti-liquor crusade on a systematic basis.The W.C.T.U.’s leading spirit, Frances E. Willard, was protypically born of NewEngland stock parents who had moved westward to study at Oberlin College, thenation’s center of aggressive, evangelical pietism, and later to settle inWisconsin. Miss Willard began as corresponding secretary of the W.C.T.U. and, intwo years she unseated the previous president and led the organization to theespousal of woman suffrage. Guided by Miss Willard, the W.C.T.U. began itspro-suffrage activities by demanding that women vote in local option referendaon prohibition. As Miss Willard put it: the W.C.T.U. wanted women to vote onthis issue because “majorities of women are against the liquor traffic ...”[29][part0012.html#fn29]Opposition to liquor and to the saloon cut against immigrant and liturgicalculture, which not only sanctioned drinking, but where the neighborhood saloonwas the major social and political institution. The saloon was an all-maleinstitution, and hence was on a collision course with woman suffrage as well asprohibition.Similarly, whenever there was a voter’s referendum on woman suffrage, theforeign-born, responding to immigrant culture and reacting against the feministsupport of prohibition, voted consistently against woman suffrage. In Iowa, theGermans voted against such suffrage; in California, the Chinese were opposed;and in South Dakota, where a referendum on woman suffrage was defeated in 1890by the massive margin of 55,000 to 22,000, Susan B. Anthony and Ida Harper wrotebitterly that “there were 30,000 Russians, Poles, Scandinavians and otherforeigners in the State, most of whom opposed woman suffrage.”Testifying for woman suffrage before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in1880, Susan B. Anthony expressed the nativism and racism of much of the feministmovement, in explaining the voter’s defeat of woman suffrage in a Coloradoreferendum in 1877:> In Colorado, ... 6,666 men voted “Yes.” Now, I am going to describe the men> who voted “Yes.” They were native-born white men, temperance men, cultivated,> broad, generous, just men, men who think. On the other hand, 16,007 voted> “No.” Now, I am going to describe that class of voters. In the southern part> of that State there are Mexicans, who speak the Spanish language. ... The vast> population of Colorado is made up of that class of people. I was sent out to> speak in a voting precinct having 200 voters; 150 of those voters were Mexican> greasers, 40 of them foreign-born citizens, and just 10 of them were born in> this country ...[30] [part0012.html#fn30]The cities, where “sin,” alcohol, immigrants, and Catholics abounded, were thecenters of opposition to woman suffrage, while the WASP rural areas tended tofavor it. The Oregon referendum of 1900, for example, lost largely because ofopposition in the “slums” of Portland and Astoria. In 1896, the woman suffragereferendum in California was heavily supported by the bitterly anti-CatholicAmerican Protective Association.[31] [part0012.html#fn31] The amendment lost by137,000 to 110,000 votes, and the Anthony and Harper volume expresses greatdisappointment about the heavy loss in Alameda County, “a most unpleasantsurprise, as the voters were principally Republicans and Populists, both of whomwere pledged in the strongest possible manner in their county conventions tosupport the amendment...” As Grimes writes, “The implication here, andfrequently throughout the various volumes of the History, was that theRepublican Party should provide the natural home for the woman suffragemovement.”[32] [part0012.html#fn32]The pietist/liturgical split on the woman suffrage question is seen in a reportby a Colorado feminist explaining the defeat in the 1877 referendum: theMethodists (most strongly pietistic) were “for us,” the less pietisticPresbyterians and Episcopalians “fairly so,” and while the Roman Catholics “werenot all against us,” clearly they were expected to be.[33] [part0012.html#fn33]It is evident from their writings that much of the drive for woman suffrage camefrom middle- and upper-class WASP women who deeply resented the fact that theirsocial inferiors, lower-class immigrants and “foreigners,” were allowed to votewhile they were not.[34] [part0012.html#fn34] Thus, as Anthony and Harper putit:> ... a real democracy has not as yet existed, but ... the dangerous experiment> has been made of enfranchising the vast proportion of crime, intemperance,> immorality and dishonesty, and barring absolutely from the suffrage the great> proportion of temperance, morality, religion and conscientiousness; that, in> other words, the worst elements have been put into the ballot box and the best> elements kept out.

Two,Wyoming and Utah, were simply repeating a practice as new states that they hadadopted much earlier as territories: Wyoming in 1869 and Utah in 1870. Utahadopted woman suffrage as a conscious policy by the Mormons to weight politicalcontrol in favor of their polygamous members, in contrast to the Gentiles,largely miners and settlers who were either single men or who had left theirwives in the East. Idaho, which was dominated both by Populists and by Mormonsin the southern part of the state, adopted woman suffrage in a referendum in1896. Wyoming, the first territory to adopt woman suffrage, did so in an effortto increase the political power of its settled householders, in contrast to thetransient, mobile, and often lawless single men who peopled that frontierregion. The measure was also expected to attract more of the sober kind ofmigrants into Wyoming.No sooner had Wyoming Territory adopted woman suffrage than it became evidentthat the change had benefited the Republicans, particularly since women hadmobilized against Democratic attempts to repeal Wyoming’s Sunday prohibitionlaw. In 1871, both houses of the Wyoming legislature, led by its Democraticmembers, voted to repeal woman suffrage, but the bill was vetoed by theRepublican territorial governor, John A. Campbell, who had been appointed byPresident Grant.Another state adopting woman suffrage in the 1890s was Colorado, which passed itby a referendum in 1893. The reason was the dominance in Colorado politics ofthe pro-inflation and pietistic Populists, then at the peak of their popularityin that state. In the referendum, the Populist counties gave a majority of 6,800on behalf of woman suffrage; while the Republican and Democratic counties voteda majority of 500 against the measure. Moreover, in the state legislature whichsubmitted the woman suffrage amendment to the voters in 1893, the partybreakdown of voting was as follows: Republicans, 19 for woman suffrage and 25against; Democrats, 1 in favor and 8 against; Populists, 34 in favor and 4against.It may be thought paradoxical that a movement born and centered in the Eastshould have had its first victories in the remote frontier states of theMountain West. But the paradox clears when we realize the pietist-WASP nature ofthe frontiersmen, many of them hailing originally from the birthplace ofAmerican pietism, New England. As the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, thatcelebrant of pietist frontier ideals, lyrically observed:> In the arid West these pioneers [from New England] have halted and have turned> to perceive an altered nation and changed social ideals. ... If we follow back> the line of march of the Puritan farmer, we shall see how responsive he has> always been to isms. ... He is the prophet of the “higher law” in Kansas> before the Civil War.

In 1882, nearlyhalf of the Republican appointees in Washington were Union veterans, whereasDemocratic appointees of the Senate were largely Confederate veterans. In theIowa Legislature of 1893, 70% of the Republicans eligible to have served wereCivil War veterans, whereas only 39% of the eligible Democrats were veterans. In1888, a poll of disabled veterans at the Ohio Soldiers and Sailors Home voted3:1 for Harrison over Cleveland. [Editor’s remarks] Ibid., pp. 22–25.In an unpublished manuscript, Rothbard wrote in depth on the origins of CivilWar pensions and their relation to the rise of the future welfare state.Pensions to Union soldiers were strongly supported by the Republicans, and theybecame a favorite way to spend the Treasury’s surplus to appeal to a newburgeoning interest group. During the Harrison administration the Dependent andDisability Pension Act was passed in 1890, sharply increasing veterans’ paymentsand contributing to the Republican “Billion Dollar Congress.” See MurrayRothbard, “Beginning the Welfare State: Civil War Veterans’ Pensions” (n.d.).[21] [part0012.html#ft21] Another example of joint business-workerrestrictionism sponsored by the Republicans was the drive to outlaw the sale ofthe products of prison labor. Thus, New York State, in its ConstitutionalConvention of 1894, passed an amendment prohibiting the sale of products ofprison labor. The amendment was supported by labor unions as well as by thosebusinesses who were competing against the output of convict labor, in particularthe manufacturers of brooms and brushes and other manufacturers whose labor wasa large part of production costs. The Republican sponsor of the amendment at theConvention pointed out that it was simply a logical extension of the RepublicanParty’s long-standing commitment to the protection of both the manufacturer andthe laborer from “unfair” competition. The opponents correctly but vainlycharged that the amendment was “class legislation,” and that prisons could nolonger be self-sustaining and would become a far greater burden on the taxpayer.[22] [part0012.html#ft22] [Editor’s footnote] Higham, Strangers in the Land, pp.56–105.[23] [part0012.html#ft23] [Editor’s footnote] For more on the relationshipbetween progressivism, pietism, and women’s suffrage, see Chapters 10 and 11below, pp. 309–14, 332–33, 340–41.

THE FIRST COLLAPSE: 1894In the cataclysmic year 1896 the face of American politics was changed forever.With the capture of the Democratic Party by the inflationist, statist forces ofWilliam Jennings Bryan, the old Democracy of free trade, hard money, personalliberty, and minimal government was gone forever. As Grover Cleveland mournfullypronounced, “... the Democratic party as we knew it is dead.”[1][part0013.html#fn1]The orthodox historical view holds that the Bryanite conquest of the DemocraticParty resulted from the Depression of 1893. In response to the depression, themasses, led by the farmers of the South and West and clamoring for increasedgovernment intervention and the greater purchasing power provided by cheapmoney, swept Bryan into the presidential nomination in the summer of 1896. Thereare, on its face, several grave problems with this conventional interpretation.In the first place, if the masses were clamoring for Bryan, why was he beatendecisively in the election by McKinley and then crushed in the general electiontwice again in 1900 and in 1908? These decisive defeats, permanently reversingthe upward Democratic trend until 1892, do not look like mass clamor.Furthermore, if the Bryan nomination was a reaction to the depression, why didthe Bryan forces continue to dominate the Democracy from then on, long after thedepression was over? Merely asserting that the public came to understand thatthe modern economy requires statism and government intervention explains nothingand only reveals the bias of the liberal historian.But more importantly, why did Bryan lose the 1896 election so heavily? TheBryanite historians, reflecting the charges of the Bryan forces at the time,fall back on contemporary charges of coercion or corruption in the pollingplaces; the masses wanted to vote for Bryan, but were intimidated into votingRepublican instead. But this conventional charge is singularly unconvincing. Inthe first place, corruption—equally on both sides—was a marked feature of allthe elections in this era, and there is no evidence whatever that there was anysudden or significant increase in pro-Republican corruption in 1896. Secondly,the Bryan forces did not charge rural coercion or corruption; the coercion wassupposed to be over laborers by employers in the urban areas. And yet, theAustralian secret ballot was by now prevalent and such coercion would have beenunfeasible. Moreover, it must be noted that Bryan, though concededly far belowthe Democratic urban vote in 1892, was yet stronger than the Democratic urbanvote in the intervening Congressional elections of 1894. Does this mean that thecoercion of workers by Republican employers was less against the hated Bryan in1896 than it had been against the conservative Democrats two years earlier?Finally, none of this even begins to explain why Bryan was rejected by the veryMidwestern farmers who were supposed to be ardent Bryan supporters and whom noone claims were coerced.[2] [part0013.html#fn2]Poor Grover Cleveland had the ill fortune to assume office just after theDepression of 1893 had begun, and just soon enough to be hit with the blame bythe voting public. The bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad hadcome two weeks before Cleveland’s inauguration in March, and then, in early May,the panic and its attendant bankruptcies hit the American economy.[3][part0013.html#fn3] The result was, indeed, a cataclysmic defeat for theDemocrats in the Congressional elections of 1894. In the elections of 1892,61.2% of the House of Representatives was Democratic; but after the fall 1894elections, only 29.4% of the House was Democrat, a disastrous loss of no lessthan 113 seats. The catastrophic declines hit across the board, in every region,occupation, ethnic, religious, and income group, and Democratic strength was inmany areas at an all-time low. In the Midwest, the Democratic voting percentagefell an average of 9.9%, from 46.9% in 1892 to 37.0% two years later. In Ohioand Wisconsin, Democratic strength was at an all-time low, as was virtually trueof Michigan as well.Despite all the talk among historians of an “agrarian upheaval” in the 1890s,the urban areas in the Northeast and the Midwest reacted even more sharplyagainst the Democracy in 1894 than did the rural areas. Taking urban as againstrural areas, for example, Democratic voting dropped 13 points in urban Michigan(from 50% to 37%) from 1892 to 1894, and 18 points in rural Michigan (from 48%to 30%); dropped 16 points (from 50% to 34%) in urban Wisconsin, and 8 points(from 47% to 39%) in rural Wisconsin; and fell 7 points (from 49% to 42%) inurban Ohio, in contrast to 4 points (from 46% to 42%) in the rural parts of thatstate. The conclusion is that while Democratic strength fell in all parts of thestate, it declined more heavily in urban areas, except for Michigan.Furthermore, the large losses for the Democracy transcended income levels;wealthy and poor rural counties dropped their support to a similar extent.Moreover, the decline was trans-ethnic, with the various ethnic and religiousgroups all cutting their votes for the Democrats the degree varying with theintensity of Democratic loyalties.Another point for the Midwest is that Republican gains did not match Democraticlosses. For the region as a whole, the Democratic loss of 9.9 points in 1894 wasmatched by a gain of only 6.7 points by the Republican Party. The differencerepresented a gain of support for the Populist Party, which also gained fromdeclines suffered by the Prohibitionists.Thus, in rural Wisconsin, while all income classes cut their support of theDemocrats to the same extent, the decline in Democratic strength among religiousand ethnic groups depended on the intensity of each group’s Democraticcommitment. Thus, the highly conservative and liturgical Wisconsin SynodLutherans reduced their support of the Democracy by a lower amount than the lessconservative Missouri Synod. German Catholics cut their support of the Democratsby an even lesser amount, and still lower were the defections of the IrishCatholics. Only the staunchly devoted Polish Catholics, of all the ethnicgroups, actually increased their support of the Democracy in 1894.In urban districts, too, the Democrats lost across the board among all income,occupational, and ethnic-religious groups. In some cases, Republican votesincreased commensurately; in others, defecting Democrats either failed to voteat all or voted Populist. Defections from the Democrats were even greater amongthe depressed miners and lumbermen.[4] [part0013.html#fn4]The impact of the Depression caused the public to stress economic issues moreintensively than before. In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act had cementedan alliance between the Republicans and the inflationist, pro-silver forces, andtended to ally the latter to the protectionist cause, the Republicans beingabove all the party of the protective tariff. The Democrats, as well as beingfree traders, had been historically a solidly hard-money, gold standard party,and the Democratic platform of 1892 condemned the Silver Purchase Act and calledfor its repeal.[5] [part0013.html#fn5] True to its commitment, the first act ofthe new Cleveland administration was to push through repeal, which enabled theRepublicans to pull out the demagogic stops and blame the silver purchase repealfor the Depression.[6] [part0013.html#fn6] In response, and in despair at theincreased defections to the pro-silver and inflationist Populists, theDemocrats, at least in the South and West, continued to shift their positionsand to take up the free silver cause. The two parties continued and intensifiedtheir differences, however, on the protective tariff question.Pledged to tariff reduction, the Democrats drove through the Wilson-Gorman Actin 1893–94; unfortunately, however, the Southern and far Western Democracy,increasingly infected with Populist views, forced the Democrats to pass anincome tax measure as part of the total package. Although rather astutebusinessmen and such New York and New Jersey Democratic leaders as U.S. SenatorDavid B. Hill (N.Y.) and James Smith, Jr. (N.J.) fought against the income tax,the increasingly statist South and West were able to push it through, with thepassive support of Cleveland, who was willing to accept the new tax in returnfor the tariff cut.[7] [part0013.html#fn7] Some Democrats were still able tochampion their old low-tax and low-budget principles, however. Thus, inWisconsin, the Democrats pointed out the depression relief their tax-cuttingpolicies caused.On generally weak economic grounds because of the Depression, the Democrats in1894 tried to shift grounds to cultural issues, and therefore launched ablistering attack on the newly burgeoning American Protective Association. Forthe benefit of the German Lutherans, the Democrats stressed the nativist as wellas the anti-Catholic policies of the A.P.A. In response, the Republicansintensified the regroupment of issues already underway; it would be folly tolose their current advantage on economic issues by alienating Lutherans andother potential defectors from the Democracy, and where the moderates were incontrol, the Republicans tried to avoid close identification with the A.P.A.Thus, in Wisconsin, the Republican Establishment managed to defeat the pietistNils Haugen, an ardent supporter of the nativist and anti-parochial schoolBennett Law, for the gubernatorial nomination. The moderates even wanted tonominate a German Lutheran for state treasurer, but were defeated by the furiousopposition of the “La Follette gang,” the pietist Haugen–La Follette faction inthe state party.[8] [part0013.html#fn8]2. THE FINAL COLLAPSE: 1896One of Paul Kleppner’s great contributions is to show, for the first time, thatthe Democratic collapse of 1894 and 1896 were two very different movements withdifferent explanations and occurring in very different segments of thepopulation. Overall, the critical nature of both elections is seen by theunusually high degree of voter turnout in both cases, as well as in the factthat a very close contest was replaced by overwhelming Republican strength.Thus, in the Midwest, a difference between the two parties of plus or minus 3%throughout the region from 1888 to 1892 was replaced by a Republican margin of16% in 1894, 11% in 1896, and 12.5% in 1900. Suddenly, the Democrats had beenreduced to the status of a permanent minority party. But the overall figures aremisleading. For the crucial point about 1896 is the great difference in the typeof party support than had been true two years before.The first difference to be pointed out between 1894 and 1896 is the enormousdrop of the minor party vote in the latter year. In fact, the minor party votein the Midwest (Prohibitionist and Populist) had risen from 1892 to 1894 andthen dropped far below the 1892 level in the 1896 election. Thus, the majorparty vote (combined Democrat and Republican) in Michigan was 91% in 1892, fellto 88% two years later, and then rose to 97% in 1896, a startling 9 point gainin the major party totals. Similarly, in Ohio the progression was 95% in 1892,89% in 1894, and 99% in 1896; in Wisconsin, it was 94%, 90%, and 98% in 1896.Thus, what had been in a sense a four-party system suddenly became a veritabletwo party system in 1896 (or, a one-and-a-half party system, with theRepublicans in a permanent majority). In short, both Republicans and Democratsmade overall voting gains in 1896 as compared to 1894.But particularly important is the sort of gains and losses experienced by bothparties. For the old ethnic and religious verities in voting patterns were nowbroken. And the new and startling ethnic and religious pattern continuedunbroken in 1900; in short, a new, fourth party system had emerged in the UnitedStates.A key to the difference between 1894 and 1896 is that, while the defectors fromthe Democrats tended to return to the fold in the latter year, another andpermanently significant shift occurred: a massive shift of traditionalliturgicals from the Democrats to the Republicans, and of pietists fromRepublicans to Democrats. Thus, the biggest Democratic gains in Michigan andOhio took place in traditionally Republican, Old Stock, and British counties.What happened? The key factor was the conquest of the Democratic Party at theJuly 1896 national convention by William Jennings Bryan and the forces ofinflation and free silver. An upheaval was occurring in the Democratic Party.The South, by now a one-party Democratic region, was having its own pietismtransformed by the 1890s. Quiet pietists were now becoming evangelical, andSouthern Protestant organizations began to call for prohibition. The new,sparsely settled Mountain states, many of them with silver mines, were alsolargely pietist. The existing hard money, laissez-faire Democracy of PresidentCleveland was suddenly and tragically repudiated; the traditional Democracy, theparty of the fathers, was gone forever. The Bryanite victory had been madepossible by the Depression-created heavy Democratic losses in the East andMidwest in 1893 and 1894, losses that swung the balance of national partyleadership to the perpetually Democratic South and to the free-silver Mountainstates of the West. The Bryan conquest was the result.Bryan claimed to represent the “toiling masses,” the workers and farmers ofAmerica, and championed silver and inflation against the Eastern “interests.”Conventionally, historians have claimed that Bryan succeeded at least among hisbeloved rural and agrarian voters. Yet, if we examine the figures, a verydifferent pattern emerges. In the Midwest, for example, Bryan gained only aminority of the rural vote, and in Michigan and Wisconsin that vote was verymuch lower than the Democrats had obtained in 1892 (41.0% as against 47.8% inMichigan, 37.2% as against 47.4% in Wisconsin). Similarly, the Bryan urban votewas also far below the 1892 levels. It is true that in each case, both urban andrural, the Democratic vote tended to be better than the 1894 disaster, but thiswas cold comfort to the Democrats when the enormous distance from 1892 wasrealized. It is true that if we compare the urban-rural Democratic percentagesin the Midwest for the two presidential years, the Democrats had been veryslightly better in urban areas before and were now generally better in ruralareas. But this hardly constitutes a great rural strength, considering theDemocrats being in a hopeless minority even there.Kleppner has examined Democratic percentages by detailed size of “urban” unit,from 2,500 population to 100,000 and over, in Michigan and in Wisconsin.[9][part0013.html#fn9] From his study it is clear that, in 1892, there was no trendby size of place in Wisconsin, and a very slight increase of Democratic supportin the larger urban areas in Michigan. Democratic support fell drasticallyacross the board in 1894, even more in small towns in Michigan and in largercities in Wisconsin. In 1896, Democratic support—with the exception ofDetroit—bounced back from two years earlier, but far below the 1892 levels inevery area. In general, over the Midwest, he did badly in both, and there wasgenerally no greater difference in urban and rural patterns than had existedsince the 1870s.What of the income class? Is there any support for the view that Bryan wasbeloved by the urban working poor? If we take the various wards in Chicago, wefind an erratic pattern of votes from upper- to lower-class wards in 1892(ranging from upper through middle and lower class, we get Democraticpercentages in that year of 45%, 56%, 45%, 57%, and 63%). The Depression yearsof 1893 and 1894 saw steady and catastrophic declines of Democratic votes acrossthe board in all income class categories (from 1892 to 1894, we see thefollowing point reductions ranging from upper- to lower-class wards 16%, 24%,15%, 25%, and 22%). Then all wards bounced back in 1896, but still far below the1892 levels. It is true that the Democrats fared slightly less badly in thelower wards, but what we see, overwhelmingly, is an across-the-board multi-classrepudiation of the Democracy (ranging from upper- to lower-class wards, theDemocratic point losses from 1892 to 1896 were 18%, 17%, 12%, 15%, and 14%). Thenon-class nature of the Bryan vote may be seen even more clearly in Detroit,where, again, the Democrats did badly in all wards, but where they were able tobounce back better was in the rich wards than in the poorer. Thus, in 1892, theDemocrats earned 52.2% in the richest wards and 59.0% in the working classwards. In 1894, they fell by 12 points in the rich wards to 40.4% and by 16points in the working-class wards to 43.3%. In 1896, however, while theDemocrats were able to rise a bit in the rich wards of Detroit to 41.2%, in theworking-class wards they fell even more sharply, to the same 41.2%.Similarly, there was no income cohesion in the rural areas. Marginal andprosperous townships behaved very differently among themselves, with no cleardifferences between the two groups. As Kleppner concludes on the rural areas,“there was no discernible relationship between receptivity to the Bryancandidacy and degree of economic prosperity.” In general, “as economic groups,neither urban workers nor farmers reacted favorably to the candidate and hisgospel of commodity price inflation.”[10] [part0013.html#fn10] And the Bryancandidacy met a similarly disastrous fate in the Northeast as well.[11][part0013.html#fn11]What happened to the Democracy? Why didn’t rural America respond to the agrarianeconomic appeals of the Bryanites? Simply, because the Bryan Democrats were mostaggressively not the Democratic party of the fathers; they were neither theparty of the liturgicals nor of personal and economic liberty. On the contrary,the Bryanities were both extreme economic statists and extreme religious andcultural pietists. All too far from the “party of personal liberty,” theBryanities were statists and pietists across the board, ever more moralisticthan the old Republican enemy. And when we consider that the Republicans hadbeen moving rapidly, and moved still further during the 1896 McKinley campaign,toward the moderate center and away from statist pietism, we can readilyunderstand the massive defection of the liturgicals from the Bryan Democracy andtoward the Republicans or toward dropping completely out of the politicalprocess. Democratic loyalists, whom even a depression could not budge, weredriven out of their party home by the invasion and triumph of the Bryaniteforces.Conversely, the conquest by Bryan heralded a substantial movement of pietistsinto the Democratic camp. Some were Old Stock Republicans; others wereProhibitionists and Populists. Indeed, that in effect is what happened to theselatter two parties: a dissolution into the newly reconstructed pietistic andstatist Democracy. In the Midwest, the Populists were of two breeds. There werethe “1892 Populists,” who had begun as Republicans and then, disgusted by theRepublican “sellout” to German Lutherans and to the saloon, moved to theProhibitionist Party. Most were native Methodists, British and Welsh Methodists,or Norwegian and Swedish Lutherans—dedicated pietists all. In 1892, many ofthese shifted into the new Populist Party. Then, in 1894, the many Democratsdefecting because of the Depression joined the Populist ranks. The “1892Populists,” then, were originally Republicans whose main motivation was pietism;the “1894 Populists” were ex-Democrats whose main worry was economic.Unsurprisingly, the two breeds of Populists reacted differently to the critical1896 election. The pietistic 1892 Populists, ex-Republicans, moved solidly intothe Democratic ranks; similarly, the Prohibitionists voted overwhelmingly fortheir fellow-prohibitionist Bryan in 1896. On the other hand, most of theex-Democrat 1894 Populists shifted into the Republican ranks. Most of theRepublican gains in 1896, indeed, came either directly from Democrats or fromthe ex-Democrat 1894 Populists.The explanation was squarely ethnic-religious: pietist vs. liturgical. For ahalf-century, the Democrats had been the party of the Catholics and otherliturgicals; the Republicans (and other minor parties) had been the party of thepietists, the coercive reformers and statists trying to reform the liturgicalsby the use of the police. Now, suddenly, in 1896, a new party system arrived:the Catholics, repelled by the ultra-pietistic Bryanites, shifted en masse intothe Republican Party that was prepared to receive their votes and support.In the Midwest, the biggest shifts came in Michigan. A large majority ofCatholics had voted Democratic in the 1892 and 1894 elections. Now, in 1896, anactual majority of Catholics shifted into the Republican ranks. The GermanLutherans shifted to the same degree away from the Democracy. Conversely, OldStock Protestants shifted toward the Democrats for the first time, although theyoften continued to give a majority to the Republicans who had not, after all,experienced the convulsive upheaval that had transformed the Democracy. TheRepublican change had been gradual, in the direction of fuzzy centrism, and itsleadership continued to be the same.In Detroit, Catholic wards shifted en masse from Democrat to Republican,regardless of economic class, and German Lutheran wards maintained their 1894defection into Republican ranks. In Michigan cities where the Democrats had beenstrong until 1892, the Democrats continued to lose voters in 1896, while incities with large numbers of Old Stock Protestant voters, the Democrats scoredheavy gains. In short, the liturgical areas not only failed to bounce back from1894, but suffered greater Democratic reverses; whereas Democrats gained votesin pietist areas. This result obtained regardless of the size of the town orcity.The same pattern held for rural areas of Michigan. In Calhoun County, theDemocrats gained in every rural township except one, Fredonia, a German Lutheranunit, the only place in the county where the Democrats did less well than in1892. Fredonia voted 55.5% Democratic in 1892 and a poorer 52.6% in 1896. TheRepublican gains were even more striking: 35.4% in 1892 and 44.6% in 1896. Incontrast, the Methodist township of LeRoy, in the same county, shifted massivelyfrom the Republican into the Democratic camp. In 1892, LeRoy had voted only30.4% Democratic, and the vote had dropped to a meager 11.4% in 1894. Yet, in1896, LeRoy voted 47.9% for the Democrats, a plurality of the total vote. TheRepublican vote in LeRoy, a whopping 70.4% in 1894, fell to 47.6% two yearslater.Similarly for other rural counties. The average Democratic gain in St. JosephCounty was a huge 32.4 points. The German Lutherans in Mottville scored thelowest Democratic gain, 9.2 points, and thereby were the only township in thecounty to do less well for the Democrats than in 1892. In contrast, theEvangelical Association Germans of Park township scored a 45.3 point Democraticgain over 1894, and 35.5 points above the 1892 level. Neither did it make anydifference whether the pietistic or liturgical townships were marginal orprosperous rural units. Thus, Park, a poor rural township, voted 60.5%Democratic in 1896, while Lockport, a prosperous Evangelical Association Germantownship in the same county, voted 63.1% for the Democrats.A striking change occurred in Branch County. In 1892, the Democrats had carriedonly one of Branch’s 16 rural townships; in 1896, they carried 11. The biggestDemocratic gains came among the pietistic Methodists and Presbyterians. Thus,California township, consisting of Presbyterians, Methodists, andCongregationalists, voted a decisive 62.1% Democratic in 1896. But in 1892, ithad voted 44.2% Democrat, a percentage which fell catastrophically to 5.0% in1894 and then rose to new heights two years later. Similarly, Methodist Gilead,fell from 39% in 1892 to 13.0% in 1894, and then bounced up to 60.5% two yearslater.Similarly in eastern Michigan’s rural Washtenaw County. The Democrats in 1896were stronger than in 1892 in four townships in the county. The townshipsdiffered widely in their economic condition; they ranged from “marginal” to“very prosperous.” But in each case the township was native pietist Protestant:Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Methodists, and Baptists. In contrast werethe Irish Catholic and German Lutheran townships. The Irish units rose slightlyover the nadir of 1894 in their Democratic voting, but they remained on theaverage 10.1 points below their 1892 average. The German Lutheran units faredeven worse for the Democracy, sinking below the 1894 levels and falling to 15.6points below 1892.In Houghton County on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the votes of the copperminers depended, once again, on their religious orientation. The Catholic minersin Hancock and Portage voted less Democratic than in 1892 or 1894, while pietistvoters shifted into the Democratic ranks. In fact, there is a virtual 1:1correlation between the Catholic or Protestant nature of the township andwhether the Democrats lost or gained strength from 1894 to 1896. Even thedevotedly Republican and anti-Catholic English Canadians in Houghton County nowvoted a majority for William Jennings Bryan.The Ohio pattern was much the same, among the farming as well as the miningtownships. In Wisconsin, Democratic losses were most striking among those verygroups—Catholic and German Lutherans—who had remained steadfast to the Democracyin the 1894 depression. While the Catholics of Wisconsin did not go as far astheir co-religionists in Michigan and give an actual majority to theRepublicans, the degree of their defection from the Democrats was severe. Thedefection also varied among ethnic and cultural groups. The Irish Catholicsdefected the least, with only two Wisconsin units voting less Democratic than in1894; all of them, however, registered less Democratic than in 1892. So severewas the trauma that even the loyal Polish Catholics fell away; every Polish unitreduced the degree of its Democratic support. The German and Bohemian Catholicsdefected more severely; 70% of German Catholic units in Wisconsin, for example,registered lower Democratic voting percentages than in 1894, much less 1892. Andwhile no Irish or Polish Catholic unit in 1896 presumed to vote a Republicanmajority, 27.2% of the German Catholic and 50.0% of the Bohemian Catholic unitsvoted Republican. Not a single one had failed to vote a Democratic majorityeither in 1892 or 1894.The pattern was even more striking among the German Lutherans of Wisconsin. InDodge County, for example, the German Lutherans of Hustisford township had voteda whopping 84.8% Democratic in 1892, and their support scarcely faltered in1894, falling only to 81.8%. Similarly, German Lutheran Theresa township voted90.7% Democrat in 1892 and 81.3% in 1894. Yet these two loyal townships, willingto serve through the hardships of the depression, could not countenance thetakeover of their beloved party by the Bryanite enemy. In 1896, Hustisford votedonly 46.0% Democratic, and Theresa only 42.7%. The pattern held throughout thestate. Every German Lutheran unit voted less Democratic in 1896 than in 1892,and only 11.3% of them rose higher than the catastrophic depression lows of1894. Over the whole state, the Democrats carried 85.2% of the German Lutheranunits in 1892, 59.2% in 1894, and only 29.6% in 1896—the lowest German Lutheransupport for the Democracy in half a century.Conversely, as Catholics and German Lutherans moved from Democrat to Republican,the pietists moved in the opposite direction. Wisconsin townships withMethodists, Swiss Reformed, and Evangelical Association Germans raised theirDemocratic vote from 10 to 13 points over 1892 levels. Among the NorwegianLutherans, the more intensely pietistic Haugeans, previously far more Republicanthan the Norwegian Synod, now shifted more strongly into the Democratic camp.The Norwegians still voted more Republican, but the Democratic minority washigher than it had been in a generation. The highly pietistic Swedish Lutheransreacted in the same way as the Haugeans. Again, while a majority remainedRepublican, the Democratic minority was now three to four times the percentagein 1892. Thus, in Swedish Burnett County, the Democratic vote was higher than in1892 in every unit, and the average Democratic vote was 21.4% points higher thanin 1892.A similar pattern held true for the urban areas of Wisconsin. In Milwaukee, theDemocratic vote fell below the 1892 level in all but one of the wards, and theRepublican percentage, 54.1%, was higher than it had been in a decade. Whereasthe Irish and Polish Catholic wards fell only about 4 points below 1892percentages, the defection was far more serious among German Catholics andLutherans. A majority of both groups of Milwaukee Germans voted for theRepublicans. The Democratic vote by German Catholics fell 12.9 points below the1892 average. Only among non-Lutheran Protestants in Milwaukee did Bryan runabove the 1892 Democratic norm.Milwaukee, due to a local labor dispute and controversy over the Polish languagein the public schools, had a more favorable Democratic climate for Catholicsthan the rest of the state. In the other urban areas of Wisconsin, the Democratsnot only trailed their 1892 vote among Catholics and German Lutherans, theyfrequently fell even below 1894. The Democrats fell below 1894 in 37 of thestate’s 51 urban areas; the degree of loss correlated strongly with theproportion of Catholics in the city’s voting population. Size of urban areamattered little in the voting shifts.[12] [part0013.html#fn12]The massive weakening of the Democratic Party was duplicated in the Northeasternstates. The defecting Cleveland Democrats either returned to the fold in 1900or, more likely, became Republican or dropped out of politics altogether. TheGerman Democrats defected massively in New York, New England, and theMiddle-West; one straw in the wind was the German-American Sound Money League,founded in 1896 and supporting the Republicans, which included such notables asCarl Schurz and Jacob H. Schiff, head of the Kuhn-Loeb investment bank.While the Germans favored free trade and opposed a protective tariff, they wereparticularly incensed at inflation and free silver and staunchly supported thegold standard. Hence, they were willing to swallow the protective tariff to votefor McKinley and the Republican pro-gold position, however newly won, andagainst the hated inflationist Bryan. Hence it was the Germans who led the marchto McKinley and the Republicans. Many of the Germans, who could not bringthemselves to vote Republican directly, voted for the new National (Gold)Democratic Party, which had broken off from the Democrats in disgust.A leading German Democrat in Illinois, Henry Raab, who had become statesuperintendent of education in an upsurge against the anti-German parochialschool Edwards Law, typified the reaction of German Democrats to the politicalcrisis of 1896. Several years earlier, in 1891, Raab had written of theconservatism and anti-emotionalism of the German religion and their desire tomaintain their customs and ideals from political aggression. Raab asserted thatthe American patriotism of the Germans lay in their “courageous struggle against‘bi-metallism’ and ‘Greenback inflation’; now the determination to pay withhonest money, that is patriotism.”[13] [part0013.html#fn13] Now, in 1896, Raableft the party of gold, voted Gold Democrat, and supported William McKinley.Decisive for the Germans of Milwaukee was the address by the BryanitePopulist-Democratic candidate for Congress, Robert Schilling. Sounding for allthe world like modern Friedmanites or Keynesians, Schilling told the assembledGermans of Milwaukee in a campaign speech that it didn’t really matter whatcommodity was chosen as money, and that “gold, silver, copper, paper, sauerkrautor sausages” would do equally well as money. The German masses laughed Schillingoff the stage, and the shrewdly opportunistic Republicans promptly adopted astheir campaign slogan “Schilling and Sauerkraut” and swept Milwaukee.So intense was the German-American devotion to gold and hard money that even theGerman communist-anarchist Johann Most, leader of a movement that sought theeventual abolition of money itself, actually came out for the gold standardduring the 1896 campaign!The Illinois Staats-Zeitung, looking back on the 1896 campaign and the decisiveshift of the German electorate, summed up its motivations:> They [the Germans] have had many complaints against the Republican party,> which ... annoyed them continually with Prohibition laws, Sunday-closing laws,> and school laws. The Germans consequently turned their backs upon the> Republicans, with the result that Cleveland was twice elected, and if the> Democrats had not inscribed repudiation, bankruptcy, and dishonor upon their> colors as a result of their union with the Populists, the Germans would have> supported them this time also ...[14] [part0013.html#fn14]Since the Irish Catholics bolted less drastically from the Democracy than theother groups, they remained to pick up the pieces and assume control of theDemocratic Party, especially in the big cities. In the Northeast, the wholesaledefection of the Cleveland Protestants left control within the party to theIrish Catholics, who proceeded for the first time in ensuing years to nominateand even elect Irish Catholic governors in New York, New Jersey, and NewEngland. In the two years after McKinley’s election, the Irish-led Democratsousted Republican mayors from a host of big cities in the Northeast and Midwest:New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Akron, Dayton,Springfield, and Milwaukee. Partly, the Irish stuck to the party as a strategyof gaining control; partly, it was a function of the pervasive dependence of theIrish on municipal government jobs and hence on party patronage.In short, the election of 1896 left the United States with a new party system: acentrist and moderately statist Republican Party with a comfortably permanentmajority of the country, and a minority Democratic Party roughly confined to theone party South and to Irish-controlled big cities of the Northeast and Midwest,which were nevertheless a minority in those regions. Gone was the sharp conflictof ideology or even of ethnic-religious values; both parties were now moderatelystatist in different degrees; both parties contained pietists and liturgicalswithin their ranks. The McKinley Republicans were happy to be known as the“party of prosperity” rather than the “party of great moral ideas.” The familiarlack of clear and genuine ideological choice between two dominant parties socharacteristic of modern America was beginning to emerge. Above all, there wasno longer a political party, nor a clear-cut constituency, devoted to thetraditional American ideology of laissez-faire.3. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PARTIESThe key to the drastic change in the American party system in 1896, then, wasthe ideological change in each of the major parties. The forces of hopped-uppietistic Bryanism had captured the Democratic Party and changed its characterforever from its ancient laissez-faire principles. At the same time, McKinleyitepragmatism had transformed the Republican Party from the home of statistpietism, from the “party of great moral ideas,” to a moderate statistorganization cleaving only to the protective tariff, and dumping any emphasis onsuch emotional and pietistic issues as prohibition or Sunday blue laws. The pullof the newfound Republican pragmatism combined with the push of the Bryanitetakeover to drive the liturgicals into the Republican Party and cementRepublican hegemony for a generation.How did the fatal transformations take place? In the first place, in bothparties, the metamorphosis was made possible by the short-run but cataclysmicDemocratic losses, matched by Republican victories, in the state andCongressional elections of 1894—losses and victories brought about by thegeneral blame placed upon the Cleveland administration for the Depression. Inthe Democratic Party, the losses concentrated in the Northeast and Midwestseemed to discredit Cleveland and his hard money and laissez-faire policies, andalso toppled laissez-faire and Clevelandite officeholders, with the power vacuumbringing the pro-inflationist and pietist South and mountain West into nationalleadership in the Democratic Party. In the Republican Party, too, the cause ofpragmatic moderation, which McKinley and others had preached for several years,was advanced by the new Republican officeholders of 1893 and 1894 who did notwant to be retired by liturgical constituents after the Depression was over. Asa corollary, their increased majorities freed the Republicans from theirpolitical dependence on the Prohibition Party and its small but importantmarginal bloc of voters. Furthermore, the depression made economic issues moreimportant relative to personal issues in the eyes of the voters and gave theRepublican moderates leeway to deemphasize the “social” issues for once and forall and to become, in their own claim, the “party of prosperity.”The important transforming role of the new Republican state legislators inpreviously Democratic districts is shown by the fact that, in the 1894 and 1895sessions, they voted more nearly like their Democratic predecessors than liketraditional Republicans. This was definitely true of Iowa, Illinois, andWisconsin. In the 1894 session of the Ohio legislators, the new Republicansvoted cohesively to weaken a local liquor option bill, and then finally todefeat this prohibitionist measure. In Michigan, the new Republicansconsistently voted not to discuss prohibition, as well as to table petitionsfrom evangelical religious groups calling for a prohibition referendum.Furthermore, they united to table a favorite measure of the American ProtestantAssociation to repeal the Michigan law permitting Catholic bishops to hold theproperty of their churches in trust.[15] [part0013.html#fn15]William McKinley came to the 1896 Republican convention as the obviousfront-runner. In 1890, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,McKinley had given his name to the highest protective tariff in American historyand thereby became inextricably linked with the hottest Republican issue. It wasan issue that endeared McKinley to the protected manufacturers fearful offoreign competition and anxious, furthermore, to organize cartels or mergersunder cover of the tariff umbrella protecting them from foreign competition.This was particularly true of the manufacturers of western Pennsylvania and ofMcKinley’s home state of Ohio. Furthermore, McKinley established hisfront-running status by bucking a Democratic tide, and by raising the banner ofpragmatism, winning of governorship of Ohio.William McKinley, though a Methodist of Ulster Scot ancestry, learned early thevalue of a moderating and integrative role across the religious and ethnicgroups. His career in law and politics was developed in Stark County, Ohio,where he found it necessary to appeal to a large proportion of German Lutheranand German and Irish Catholic voters. Furthermore, his family’s connections withiron manufacturing also led McKinley to stress economic issues and theprotective tariff. America’s inefficient iron and steel industry had led the cryfor a protective tariff ever since 1820, and had continued to do so in theprotectionist years after the Civil War.McKinley’s long-time friend, political boss, and mentor in the new pragmaticapproach was the Cleveland industrialist Marcus Alonzo Hanna. As a coal and ironmagnate, Hanna also championed the protective tariff. Hanna was a long-timefriend and business associate of John D. Rockefeller and provided the channel bywhich the Cleveland oil refiner was able to influence the powerful OhioRepublican Party, a party which gave no less than five presidential nominees tothe national party between 1876 and 1920.[16] [part0013.html#fn16] Hanna hadbeen a high-school chum of Rockefeller’s at Central High, Cleveland, and hiscoal and iron business was economically closely allied with Standard Oil.Relatives of Hanna were direct investors in the stock of the closely heldStandard Oil Trust.Hanna repeatedly loaned money to the ever hard-pressed McKinley while in office,and in 1893 Hanna organized a secret consortium of industrialists to salvage theGovernor when he went bankrupt. It was Hanna who engineered the McKinleynomination, promptly became national chairman of the party, and was then, atMcKinley’s instigation, elevated to the U.S. Senate the year after McKinley’selection to the presidency.But while McKinley was the leading candidate for the nomination, he had aproblem. The Republican Party had been the home of the inflationists and thefree-silver forces, and Congressman McKinley had repeatedly voted for silverpurchase acts and for free-silver. He was therefore distrusted by the pro-goldMorgan forces and the rest of Wall Street, which considered McKinley—and withgood reason—dangerously soft on silver and inflation. The Morgans, it is true,were traditionally Democrats, but the impending takeover of the Democracy by thewild-eyed Bryanites forced them to focus on their allies within the RepublicanParty, and look to that party for salvation. Also distrusting McKinley’ssilverite record was the powerful Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed of Maine,who presented himself for the nomination.Furthermore, McKinley would aggravate the Morgans further by refusing to agreeto the Morgans’ candidate for the presidency, the prominent banker and closefriend of Morgan, Levi P. Morton, as a consolation choice for vice president.Morton, currently the governor of New York, was former vice president of theUnited States under Benjamin Harrison and president of the Morton Trust Company,which was later to form the nucleus for the Morgan-dominated Guaranty TrustCompany.From the summer of 1895 until the Republican convention in June of the followingyear, the Morgan forces put enormous pressure upon McKinley and Hanna to abandonsilver as well as trimming upon the currency issue, to advocate gold openly andsquarely. The sources of pressure included William C. Beer, attorney for theMorgan-controlled New York Life Insurance Company; Whitelaw Reid, publisher ofthe New York Tribune; and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. They werejoined by Thomas C. Platt, Republican boss of New York State, who was fueled byan $85,000 fund provided by the American Bankers Association. McKinley and hisassociates had prepared a Republican monetary plank calling for the maintenanceof the “existing standard.” Forwarding this insertion to McKinley, Whitelaw Reidurged, in commenting upon Wall Street opinion:> The anxiety here, on the whole subject of the money plank to be adopted next> week [in late June at St. Louis], can hardly be exaggerated. There seems to be> no doubt that the most conservative bankers are extremely apprehensive that> any hesitation on our part to take the squarest sound money ground would bring> a great and probably sudden depression in values. On the other hand, there is> no doubt that the enclosed plank ... will be followed by an appreciation in> values.[17] [part0013.html#fn17]Finally, on the eve of the Republican convention, McKinley capitulated andcommitted himself wholeheartedly to the gold standard. In its platform, theRepublican Party declared itself “unreservedly for sound money” and “unalterablyopposed to every measure calculated to debase our currency, or impair the creditof the country.” It concluded that it was “opposed to the free coinage ofsilver” except by international agreement, and that “until such agreement can beobtained the existing gold standard must be preserved.”[18] [part0013.html#fn18]The adoption of the firm gold standard plank by the Republican Party drove theSilver Republicans out of the convention and out of the party. Their leader,Senator Henry Teller of Colorado, one of the founders of the Republican Party,mounted the rostrum at the convention and announced that he and 33 otherdelegates, largely from the mountain states of Montana, Colorado, Utah, andIdaho, were bolting the convention and the Republican Party. Clearly, they wereplanning to leave for the reconstituted Democratic Party that was widelyexpected to emerge the following month at Chicago.[19] [part0013.html#fn19]The Silver Republicans were gone, but it was a bargain price for the Republicansto pay for becoming the gold party in the United States. For, in return, theRepublicans were able to attract not only the Morgans and Wall Street, but alsothe Germans and other liturgicals devoted to gold and sound money.[20][part0013.html#fn20]The next month, in July at Chicago, the Bryanites achieved their conquest of theDemocratic Party at the national convention. Their triumph had been prefiguredfor the past two years, as the Bryanites had captured state after state party inthe South and West. Even the Midwestern state parties fell, with only staunchWisconsin remaining in pro-gold hands. After teetering back and forth, theMichigan Democracy finally fell to the Bryan forces, with the result that theDemocrats lost the state for a decade.At Chicago, the Democrats repudiated their own sitting president, GroverCleveland, adopted a radically new platform, and, for the first time since theCivil War, turned away from the Northeast and chose as their presidentialnominee someone from west of the Mississippi.William Jennings Bryan was born of small-town pietist stock in southernIllinois. As a southern Baptist, Bryan’s father was a leading Democrat andone-time State Senator. Bryan was the quintessential pietist and believer instate paternalism and compulsory morality, believing in the Christian duty ofthe state to create a “safe” social atmosphere for the righteous. So marked werethese traits in Bryan that his leading biographer calls him a “politicalevangelist,” while another distinguished historian has dubbed Bryan a“Revivalist.”[21] [part0013.html#fn21] Moving to Lincoln, Nebraska as a youngattorney, Bryan quickly rose in Democratic Party politics. As a Democrat, hecould not yet commit himself or his party to prohibition, but he soon made hismark as a personal temperance man, and he managed to commit the state party in1889 to restricting the flow of liquor through high license fees.The following year, Bryan ran successfully for Congress. With many liturgicalsliving in a district which encompassed both Lincoln and Omaha, Bryan managed topick up votes from both sides of the prohibition issue for his middle-of-theroad stance. Instead, he stressed the veteran Democratic issue of opposition tothe protective tariff. But two years later, Omaha had been reapportioned out ofBryan’s district, which was now significantly more pietist, native Protestant,prohibitionist, and agrarian. In his campaign for reelection, Bryan could adoptfree silver as his major cause and thereby win over the votes of the pietisticagrarian Populists in his district.At the Chicago Democratic convention, the fateful result was prefigured by thefirst tussle at the meeting, one in which Clevelandite Senator David. B. Hill ofNew York moved that the convention endorse the Cleveland administration. Whenthe motion was voted down, the pattern of the convention, and of the newDemocratic Party, was clear.The Cleveland Democracy was now squarely confronted with what their course ofaction should be. Probably the only hope for the old laissez-faire Democracywould have been an immediate and massive bolt, a blistering denunciation of theBryanites, and the creation of a new “third” party to carry the Clevelanditebanner. This might have kept the liturgical and laissez-faire constituency, andthe new party could either have continued permanently, or else dissolved into arecaptured Democratic Party. A bolt and denunciation was the courageous courseadvocated by a group headed by New York Governor Roswell P. Flower and 25 otherNew York delegates, including financier Perry Belmont and Wall Street lawyerFrederic R. Coudert. But the New York Clevelandite leaders, Senator Hill andCleveland’s financial and political mentor William C. Whitney, decreedotherwise. The Cleveland forces temporized instead and merely decided to abstainfrom future ballots or even vote in token fashion for former Governor Robert E.Pattison of Pennsylvania.Having lost their best chance, the Cleveland Democrats tried to decide what todo. Financier Whitney pleaded with McKinley to soft-pedal the protective tariffand thereby form a broad coalition against Bryanism; McKinley, however, waswilling to soft-pedal everything else, but protectionism, after all, was bothhis own and his party’s only distinctive program remaining. The Clevelandites,therefore, decided at last to form a third party, the National Democrats, or“Gold Democrats,” who met in September at Indianapolis. The best and mostdramatic candidate for the Gold Democrats would have been President Clevelandhimself, but he refused any nomination in advance. The new party then nominatedSenator John M. Palmer of Illinois for president and Simon B. Buckner ofKentucky for vice president. The fact that Palmer had been a Union general andBuckner a Confederate general in the Civil War symbolized the desire of the GoldDemocrats to bury the old North-South hatchet. The platform, prepared by theveteran head of the Wisconsin Democracy, Senator William F. Vilas, not only cameout strongly for the gold standard and denounced free silver; it also denouncedprotectionism, free silver’s ally in the governmental creation of specialprivilege. It went on to attack all forms of governmental paternalism. TheNational Democratic platform was the last gasp of the old hard money,laissez-faire Democracy. The major support for the new party came from the“Honest Money Democrats” of Illinois and of other Midwestern and Border states.They had found their state parties captured by the Bryanites and were thereforedesperate enough to form another party. The Eastern Clevelandites, however,still controlled their local parties and were therefore less willing to form anew one. The Southern Democrats, also, were too worried about Populists or abouta possible Republican revival to dare to bolt the party.The Eastern sound money Democrats also failed to support the third party becauseof their understandable but short-sighted eagerness to defeat Bryan in theelection made them virtual or outright champions of McKinley. This was the routetaken by Whitney, Flower, Coudert, Representative William Bourke Cockram of NewYork’s Tammany Hall, and the financier Thomas Fortune Ryan. Cleveland himselfapproved of the National Democrats but vacillated in public support. Leading NewYork supporter of the Gold Democrats was Calvin Tompkins, head of the statecommittee of the new party and chairman of the ardently pro-gold Sound CurrencyCommittee of the Reform Club of New York, an organization which was alsofervently in favor of free trade. In contrast to the other short-sightedClevelandites, Tompkins saw the need for a long-run sound money party, whichcould educate the public permanently and form a continuing structure for thehard-money constituency in the country.Unfortunately, even Palmer and National Gold Democrat Chairman William D. Bynumof Indiana envisioned the new party as merely a pro-McKinley move rather thanthe beginnings of a permanent organization on behalf of laissez-faire Democracy.Apart from Tompkins, only Ellis B. Usher, chairman of the Wisconsin GoldDemocrats, saw the party as a permanent way of keeping alive the flickeringflame of personal and economic liberty—of rebuilding the old Democracy in a newinstitutional form.Beset by a lack of spirit and vision, the National Democratic Partyunsurprisingly played only a minor role in the 1896 campaign. They polled onlyroughly 133,000 votes out of 13.7 million and achieved balance-of- power statusonly in Kentucky and California. The National Democrats quickly faded from viewafter the election. The last chance to preserve laissez-faire Democracy waslost. But, to be fair, even the best will in the world might not haveestablished the National Democrats as a permanent political force. For theliturgicals shifted to the Republicans, rather than the National Democrats,precisely because they correctly perceived the new McKinley Republicanism ashaving abandoned pietism and changed to a pragmatic and centrist party.[22][part0013.html#fn22]The woes of the Democrats intensified after the election. The Easternsound-money men were scarcely rewarded for not joining the National Democracy.On the contrary, in the wake of the smashing Democratic defeat, the old-stockProtestants who had run the Democratic Party in the Eastern cities (men such asGrover Cleveland, Calvinist—and hence creedal rather than pietist—Presbyterianfrom Buffalo) were now removed from leadership positions and deposed by menrising up from the predominantly Irish constituency. But the Irish Democratssoon found that it had been easier to unite Catholic and Lutheran ethnic groupsunder the benign leadership of old-line WASPS; throughout New England the newIrish domination of the Democratic Party rapidly alienated newly burgeoningItalian and French Catholic voters, who now proved amendable to the lures of thenew, open Republican Party. In urban eastern areas, the growing identificationof the Democracy as “the Irish party” succeeded in repelling other Catholic andliturgical voters and cemented the Republican Party as the national majorityparty.[23] [part0013.html#fn23]In addition to these troubles, the Democracy became shaken after Bryan’stakeover by prohibitionist sentiment. The South became converted toprohibitionism and was now the preeminent sectional stronghold of the DemocraticParty. The post-Bryan Democracy outside of the South was not cohesivelyprohibitionist, but it was racked by powerful struggles over the issue withineach state party. In some Eastern states, such as New York and Massachusetts,the internal battle was quickly won by the wets and Catholics. In others,however, the battle was closer and longer-lasting. Thus, in Ohio in 1905, theDemocrats gained the endorsement of the powerful Anti-Saloon League bynominating a prohibitionist for governor against a post-McKinley Republican. InNew Jersey, Anti-Saloon League endorsement of the rising progressive DemocratWoodrow Wilson ensured his election for governor in 1910 and put him on the roadto the presidency. The Anti-Saloon endorsement raised the turnout rate in therural, native Protestant southern counties of the state by a remarkable 10 to 15percentage points over the 1906 election, and Wilson’s share of the voteincreased by 12 to 20 points above the Democratic gubernatorial vote four yearsearlier.[24] [part0013.html#fn24]What of the other minor parties, the Populists and the Prohibitionists? Theinflationist and statist Populists, gleeful at the Bryan victory as a triumphfor their principles, happily nominated Bryan for president and later dissolvedthemselves into the Democratic Party. The Farmers’ Alliance movement, as muchprohibitionist and pro-Sabbath law as they were agrarian statists, alsosupported Bryan to the hilt. While Bryan did not openly come out forprohibition, the prohibitionists correctly perceived him as one of their own.While the Prohibition Party refused to fuse into the Democracy, much fusion forBryan occurred at the county level throughout the Midwest. Indeed, when thenational convention of the Prohibition Party insisted (as “narrow gaugers”) onkeeping to one issue and to their separate entity, the “broad gaugers” splitfrom the Prohibition Party and formed the National Party, dedicated to fusingprohibitionists with the new Bryanite Democracy. Their support, added to thewhole support of state and local W.C.T.U. organizations, brought mostprohibitionists into the Bryan camp. In effect, then, the Prohibition Party alsodissolved into the Bryanite Democracy.Populists for Bryan habitually hailed his candidacy as the new “moral crusade,”a crusade against the “saloon power” and the embodiment of a new “party ofpiety.” Bryanite “silver clubs” arose throughout the South and West, behavinglike revival meetings on an all-out moral crusade, and thereby frightening theliturgicals as much with their style and rhetoric as well as the substance oftheir program.As Professor Kleppner writes:> The tripartite cooperation of Democrats, Populists, and Prohibitionists was> the type of grand union of “reformers” that many of the Midwestern Prohibition> leaders especially had sought for several years. ... Bryanites were not> concerned with a mere reactivation of old loyalties, but with the creation of> a new coalition of voters. They hoped to draw support from the Prohibition,> Populist, and Republican ranks by appealing to the concern of such voters for> the creation of a moral society. To reinforce the proclivity of these voters> to shift to the “new party of morality” ... they employed free silver> ideology. It was intended ... to function as a morally toned ideology> enlisting the support of voter groups that looked to the use of government> power as a remedy for society’s increasing amorality ...> > Because they were relatively more concerned with conversion than with> reactivation or reinforcement of old commitments, both Bryan and his> Midwestern supporters deemphasized their Democratic lineage and their> connections with the old Democratic ideology.

This was> not the Democracy whose usual program was a litany of “thou shalt nots,” but a> Democracy espousing that very type of government which for over half a century> had repelled religious ritualists [liturgicals].[25] [part0013.html#fn25]How did the old-line Democratic leaders and organs of opinion counter theBryanites and persuade their readers and supporters to shift to the formerlyhated Republicans? They attacked free silver, not primarily on economic grounds,but as part of the Bryanite betrayal of the principles of the old DemocraticParty. In short, the Cleveland Democrats correctly pointed out to theirconstituents that Bryan was the reverse of a true Democrat in the previousscheme of things. Specifically, Bryanism was a violation of the old Democraticbelief in “personal liberty,” for it was yet another attempt to “regulatethings ... and to propose laws governing the habits, pursuits, and beliefs ofmen.”[26] [part0013.html#fn26] And German anti-Bryan papers argued that Bryanwas at heart a prohibitionist.For their part, the new McKinley Republican Party cooperated enthusiastically inwelcoming liturgicals into their ranks. They abandoned the old pietist symbolismand presented themselves now not as the party of morality, but as the party ofprosperity sheltered by the protective tariff. In Wisconsin, for example, theRepublicans followed this strategy by rejecting Robert M. La Follette, pietist,champion of the Bennett Law, and friend of the nativist and anti-CatholicAmerican Protective Association, in deference to the fierce opposition of GermanLutheran leaders.The A.P.A., indeed, was in a quandary in the 1896 election. Previously solidlyRepublican, the A.P.A. had fought the moderate McKinley bitterly in Ohiopolitics and had supported the prohibitionist Foraker. The A.P.A. was alsoembittered at McKinley’s willingness to appoint Catholics to public office andat his refusal to appoint leading A.P.A. members. In 1896, the A.P.A. foughtMcKinley’s nomination with great bitterness. During the spring, the NationalAdvisory Board of the A.P.A. accused Governor McKinley of having discriminatedin favor of Catholics and against native-born Protestants in his appointments topublic office. And in May, both the Executive Committee and the CampaignCommittee of the A.P.A. publicly denounced McKinley and announced the supportfor any other Republican candidate.The upshot was dissension and confusion during the 1896 campaign in A.P.A.ranks. Indeed, the consequence was the rapid disintegration of the A.P.A. andits early disappearance from American life. A.P.A. attacks, however, greatlyaided McKinley’s ability to attract Catholic support.[27][part0013.html#fn27][28] [part0013.html#fn28]William McKinley gained the presidency in the first decisive Republican victoryfor the office since 1872 as the first presidential candidate of either partysince 1876 to gain a majority of the popular vote. And, as we have pointed out,he began a long era of Republican control of the presidency along with bothhouses of Congress. McKinley’s presidency quickly moved to bury old divisivepietist concerns. Prohibitionism was scuttled by the Republicans, was onlyrevived by the Progressive movement, and was fastened on the country by thetemporarily resurgent Democrats, and then only under cover of war.[29][part0013.html#fn29] The woman suffrage movement also died out after 1896 andwas revived 15 years later by the Progressive movement.[30] [part0013.html#fn30]And, while President McKinley formally supported the immigrationrestrictionists’ drive for a literacy test, the Republican enthusiasm for thebill was gone. For many Republicans observed that liturgicals and theforeign-born vote had shifted to McKinley, and the newly powerful German groupswere organizing strongly to prevent immigration restriction. Officers of 150German-American societies condemned any such bill as a revival ofKnow-Nothingism and bigotry, and German and other nationalities formed anImmigration Protective League to combat restrictionism. The House simply failedto act on immigration restriction in 1898, and the agitation died. Once again,it took the Democratic Party and World War I to put an end to America’stradition of free immigration.[31] [part0013.html#fn31]Some of the new dimensions of the new American party-system which emerged fromthe 1896 election may be seen in a study by Paul Kleppner. Kleppner compares theaverage partisan leads in the various regions in the two decades, 1882–1892, thefinal and mature years of the third party-system, and 1894–1904, the beginningsof the fourth party-system. The average partisan leads for the two periods areas follows:Partisan Leads (Percentage points)[32] [part0013.html#fn32] 1882–1892 1894–1904New England 8.1 R 23.6 R Mid-Atlantic 0.1 R 16.9 R East-North-Central 1.1 R14.8 R West-North-Central 18.1 R 23.5 R South 32.6 D 39.1 D Border 10.9 D 0.6 DMountain 11.7 R 3.8 D Pacific 3.5 R 15.5 R U.S.: Non-South 2.4 R 14.5 R U.S.:Total 3.7 D 7.7 RIt is clear that a one-party Democratic South with a slight Republican lead ortie in the rest of the country had been transformed into an even more one-partySouth with a strong Republican lead everywhere else. More specifically, acomfortably Republican New England was now heavily Republican, the evenly foughtMiddle Atlantic states were now solidly Republican, and the equally evenlyfought East-North-Central (roughly what we have called “the Midwest”) was nowalso decisively in the Republican camp. The same fate had hit the previouslynarrowly Republican Pacific states, while the previously solidly DemocraticBorder areas were now nip-and-tuck. The fact that Bryanite free-silver agitationhad changed the thinly-populated western Mountain states from firmly Republicanto narrowly Democratic was hardly sufficient comfort for the bushwhackedDemocratic Party.The unchallenged hegemony of the Republican Party was reflected in all ofAmerica’s political institutions. For instance, the previously closepresidential races where there was either a tie in the popular vote or aDemocratic lead was now replaced by significant Republican victories. In 1876,Samuel Tilden notably bested Rutherford B. Hayes in the popular vote (50.9%versus 47.9%), despite not getting the presidency. In 1880, James Garfieldnarrowly beat Winfield Scott Hancock (48.27% versus 48.25%), while GroverCleveland accomplished the same against James Blaine in 1884 (48.9% versus48.3%). In 1888, the Democrats won the popular vote again but did not gain thepresidency when Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison (48.6% versus 47.8%). In the1892 rematch, Cleveland defeated Harrison by a sizable lead (46% versus 43%).But starting in 1896, the Republicans dominated the next several elections. In1896, William McKinley triumphed over William Jennings Bryan (51% versus 46.7%)and won by an even larger lead in the 1900 rematch (51.6% versus 45.5%).Theodore Roosevelt crushed Alton B. Parker in 1904 (56.4% versus 37.6%), andWilliam Howard Taft won by a similarly large margin against Bryan in 1908 (51.6%versus 43%). Not only was there a Republican president from 1896 until the partysplit temporarily in 1912, but so too were the other political structures.Whereas only once since the mid-1870s until the mid-1890s did any one partycontrol the presidency and both houses of Congress, now, from 1897 through 1911,the Republicans continuously and simultaneously controlled all three organs.Between 1894 and 1904, the Republicans elected 70.6% of all the members ofnon-Southern state legislators, and from 1894 to 1931 the Republicans elected noless than 67.2% of the governors of the Midwestern and Western states, as wellas 83.1% of the governors in the New England and mid-Atlantic regions. The Southwas one-party Democratic, and only the relatively insignificant Mountain statesexperienced any sort of vibrant two-party contest.Not only did liturgicals shift heavily to the Republican Party after 1896, but,ironically, the new moderate McKinley Republicanism, the “Party of Prosperity,”which had clung only to the protective tariff of the old-time Republican issues,was eventually even able to attract many pietists back from the lures of BryanDemocracy. In consequence, the crushing of Bryan in the presidential electionsof 1900 and 1908 was even more decisive than in 1896. Kleppner has examinedtypically pietist and liturgical areas in the two decades. Six PennsylvaniaGerman counties, +5.5% Democratic in the 1882–1892 decade, shifted to +6.6%Republican in the following ten years. Even more decisively, the liturgicalWisconsin Germans, an average of +24.7% Democratic in ten counties in the firstperiod, shifted to +1.6% Republican in the latter. In contrast, ten counties ofpietistic Pennsylvania Yankees, +10.3% Republican in the first decade, increasedtheir margin to +23.1% Republican in the next; while ten counties of pietisticWisconsin Scandinavians, +24.8% Republican in the former, shifted to a whopping45.5% Republican in the latter. Turnout rates fell in all these groups, rangingfrom a drop of 11% to 20%. Even the largely liturgical big cities, heavilyDemocratic cities (Boston, Brooklyn), shifted to nip-and-tuck contests;Baltimore fell from heavily Democratic to decisively Republican, while Chicagoshifted from solidly Democratic to heavily Republican.Thus, after 1896, neither major party could any longer be considered the home ofconsistent ideology or of emphatically pietist or liturgical religious values.Both parties were a mixed bag. The new Republican hegemony, as well as the evenstronger Democratic hegemony in the South, combined with the great decline ofsharp ideological or ethno-religious conflict between the parties, led to aprecipitate drop in voter turnout in state and national elections. The followingtable of average voter “turnout rates” (percentages of eligible persons voting)for the two-party systems was presented by Professor Kleppner:Turnout Percentages[33] [part0013.html#fn33] 1874–1892 1900–1918 Changes inTurnout New England 56.4 47.9 -8.5 Mid-Atlantic 67.9 55.1 -12.8East-North-Central 74.9 61.3 -13.6 West-North-Central 64.8 61.7 -3.1 South 56.124.6 -31.5 Border 66.4 65.8 -0.6 Mountain 54.8 74.1 +19.3 Pacific 52.8 43.6 -9.2U.S.: Non-South 67.3 57.6 -9.7 U.S.: Total 64.8 51.1 -13.7The 14 and 13 point turnout drops in the Mid-Atlantic and East-North-Centralregions reflected the sudden shift from close conflict to Republican hegemony,as did, to a slightly lesser degree, the drops in New England and the Pacificstates. The extreme drop in Southern participation rates reflected also thedisenfranchisement of blacks that took place in this period.[34][part0013.html#fn34] Only in the relatively unimportant Border and Mountainregions, where the intensity of party conflict heightened instead of slackened,did turnout rates stay the same or even increase.[35] [part0013.html#fn35]Looking at the turnout rates for the presidential elections, we can see evenmore starkly from the following table the steady and drastic decline in voterparticipation:Turnout Rates in Presidential ElectionsOutside of the South[36] [part0013.html#fn36] 1896 78.3 1900 71.6 1904 64.7 190867.9 1912 55.9 1916 59.7To put these figures in perspective, voter turnout rates in presidentialelections had risen from 55–58% from 1828–36, to 80.2% in 1840, after which theyranged from 70% to 84%. The post-1896 declines dropped turnout rates back topre-1840 levels.Not only did voter turnout drastically decline, but the character of thatturnout changed sharply to reflect the new conditions of American politicalparties. Before 1896, as we might expect, turnout rates were much higher amongchurch members than among those unaffiliated with churches; now, however,turnout of church members dropped far more precipitously. In the third electoralsystem, the poor tended to vote more proportionately than the wealthy, but nowthe relative participation of the poor declined greatly. The same is true ofyoung, and first- and second- generation foreign voters. Old habits die hard,and we would expect the new trend toward non-voting to hit first and deepestamong the young, newly-eligible age groups. Thus, between 1876 and 1892, 62.1%of newly eligible non-southern voters turned out to the polls, but from 1900 to1916, only 41.2% of the newly eligible bothered to vote.[37][part0013.html#fn37]As Kleppner states:> ... the electoral demobilization that occurred was neither uniform nor random> in its social effects, but clearly and strongly class skewed. The> participation gap was most noticeable among voters towards the bottom end of> the economic scale, and—even net of these economic effects—among younger-aged> cohorts. Around the turn of the century, in other words, electoral politics> seemed to lose much of its earlier capacity to arouse the enthusiasm of most> citizens and to enlist their active participation.[38] [part0013.html#fn38]But how could voter interest decline drastically, especially among the poor andthe young, in the very Progressive Era (approximately 1900–1917), which has beentrumpeted by the Progressives themselves and laudatory historians as the voiceof “the people” and the “march of expanding democracy”? Obviously, historianshave, at least until the last decade or so, unfortunately taken the progressivesat face value. The march of triumphal democracy was, in stark reality, a merecamouflage for an assault on democracy and on freedom on behalf of theburgeoning coalition of technocratic and Big Business elites.For the new non-ideological party system and demobilized electorate meant alsothat the political party itself became far less important in deciding governmentpolicy. And, along with the parties, their constituencies—the votingpublic—became less important in influencing government actions. This decline ofthe political party as well as its voting constituency left a power vacuumwhich, as will be detailed below, the new order of experts, technocrats, andorganized economic pressure groups rushed to fill. The dominance of the newelites alienated still more citizens and swelled the ranks of non-voters. Theway was paved for the Progressive period.As Paul Kleppner sums up the new trend:> ... the cumulative effect of noncompetitiveness and mass demobilization,> combined with legal changes downgrading the role of the party as organization,> was to lower party effectiveness as a mobilizing agency and thus to reduce its> capacity to shape policy outputs. Freeing elected decisions-makers from the> constraints of the party was a requisite condition to increase the> policy-shaping role of other political institutions capable of articulating> group interests. As the party’s role as a determinant of legislative voting> behavior declined, for example, the influence of functionally organized> economic interest groups increased. That was accompanied by an accelerated> tendency to remove large clusters of policy from even the potential influence> of party behavior by shifting decision-making from elected to appointed> bodies. Done in the name of “efficiency” and “expertise,” the consequence of> that removal was further to insulate decision-making from organized mass> opinion. That insulation was an indispensable stage in the efforts of> cosmopolitan elites to eliminate the party as a critical source of localist> resistance to the centralizing impulses of corporate capitalism.[39]> [part0013.html#fn39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0013.html#ft1] See Allan Nevins, ed., The Letters of Grover Cleveland(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1933), pp. 440–41, 525.

See also pp. 156–59, 167. By the end of the1880s, many more Republicans, especially in the East, favored hard moneypolicies. The Republican campaign platform of 1888 supported the use of bothgold and silver, and true to its pledge, President Harrison signed the ShermanSilver Purchase Act. See Allan Nevins, Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage (NewYork: Dodd, Mead, 1932), pp. 465–66.[6] [part0013.html#ft6] Unfortunately, Cleveland made the fateful decision to goback on his platform commitment to repeal the 10% tax on state bank notes, inforce since the Civil War. This tax had destroyed the decentralized, freebanking system of pre-Civil War America, and had replaced it with aquasi-centralized and more inflationary banking system. Repeal would havechanged the banking system in the strong direction of decentralized freebanking, and while it would not really have been inflationist, thepro-inflationary South and West believed differently. The Clevelandadministration, then, could have split the inflationist South and West whilefostering rather than crippling the long-standing Democratic free banking andhard money principles.[7] [part0013.html#ft7] The Democrats, in passing an income tax, were alsoresponding to Republican taunts of where government revenue would be coming fromif tariffs were significantly lower. There was, of course, another answer: thatpre-Civil War America had gotten along nicely with free trade and no income tax,and reduced spending could have restored that kind of a revenue system.[Editor’s remarks] Cleveland was ultimately dissatisfied with the minor tariffreductions in the Wilson-Gorman Act and allowed the bill to become law withouthis signature. The income tax was later struck down by the Supreme Court asunconstitutional in 1895, and the Wilson-Gorman Tariff was replaced by the 1897Dingley Tariff, which reaffirmed protectionism. The income tax would return inthe Taft administration, and alongside the rate reducing Underwood Tariff, the16th Amendment was passed under the Taft and Wilson administrations in 1913. Thepassage of the income tax was due to a coalition of groups favoring tariffreduction but eager to find a substitute source of revenue. They were theprogressive populists who wanted to reduce income inequality, manufacturingexport firms, and those involved in South American and Asian foreign directinvestment. The latter also had a vested interest in using the tax to fund thegrowing pension plans and naval military buildup, which would be used to protecttheir overseas investments. Although under the initial law the tax only hit theupper class with the top rate at 7%, during World War I the government extendedits encroachment, and rates skyrocketed, including on the middle class.

(Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, 1985), pp. 121–38.A high income tax penalizes up-and-coming entrepreneurs who earn high annualincomes relative to their wealth at the expense of existing wealthyentrepreneurs who earn relatively low annual incomes. As a result, it reducesincome mobility and ossifies the existing elite.

Jones andWilliam Stewart of Nevada were both wealthy silver mine operators. Marcus Daly,major owner of the great Anaconda mines in Montana, fought for free silver andwas the main subsidizer of the American Bimetallic League, which employed Bryanas a lecturer. Daly and his Anaconda associates spent $289,000 to obtaindelegates for free silver at the Democratic convention, and Daly gave $50,000more to the Bryan campaign after the nomination.

President Cleveland and the gold standard were attackedas agents of the “European Jew Rothschild,” it being noted that the Belmonts, asRothschild agents, had long been highly influential in the old Democratic Party.Herman Ahlwardt, a leading German born anti-Semite, endorsed Bryan in TheGentile News. More importantly, Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Lease, the great womanorator of Kansas Populism, attacked President Cleveland as “the agent of Jewishbankers and British gold,” while leading Minnesota populist and prohibitionistIgnatius Donnelly wrote a novel Caesar’s Column, prophesying a future societyruled and exploited by a Jewish world oligarchy.

Then, a series of sharp declines occurred, to 60% in 1892 and 1896,then to 50% in 1900, and finally to approximately 38% in 1904 and in subsequentelections. These declines, in poor white as well as black turnout, reflected theimposition of the poll tax and of literacy requirements for voting throughoutthe South during this period. They also reflected the failure of thepietist-Republican Force Bill in 1891, which would have imposed federallysupervised elections in Southern state elections to ensure black voting. SeeJerrold G. Rusk and John J. Stucker, “The Effect of the Southern System ofElection Laws on Voting Participation: A Reply to V.O. Key, Jr.,” in The Historyof American Electoral Behavior, J. Sibley, A. Bogue, and W. Flanigan, eds.(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 198–250. Also see J. MorganKousser, The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restrictions and theEstablishment of the One-Party South, 1880–1910 (New Haven, CT: Yale UniversityPress, 1974).[Editor’s remarks] The Jim Crow segregation laws enacted during this time wereopenly championed by Southern Progressives. This support was not a “blind spot”of the well-intentioned reformers, but rather part and parcel of theirinterventionist agenda to control and cartelize society to benefit specialinterest groups (such as the Anglo-Saxon white worker). See William L. Andersonand David Kiriazis, “Rents and Race: Legacies of Progressive Policies,”Independent Review (Summer 2013): 115–33, and Chapter 9 below, pp. 292–93.[35] [part0013.html#ft35] The alternative view to that presented here holds thatthe sharp drop in post-1896 voter turnout stemmed from the adoption of personalregistration requirements for voting in nearly every state. But such explanationignores the fact that (a) voter turnout nevertheless increased in the Mountainstates where party conflict intensified, and (b) the registration requirementswere imposed only in the cities, but turnout declines occurred with equalseverity in the rural as in the urban areas.

This was highly related to the increased centralization and similarityof the parties, and the creation of the vacuum for technocrats and policymakersto control everything behind the scenes. Moreover, the 17th Amendment weakenedstate legislatures, and hence state governments, and transferred this power intothe hands of the federal government. The diminished ability of the states tocheck the power of the federal government allowed for a greater expansion andconsolidation of government activities."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7"},{"pageContent":"THEODORE ROOSEVELT:THE FIRST PROGRESSIVE,PART I1. FINANCIAL INFLUENCE ON POLITICAL PARTIESBefore 1896, the Democratic Party was roughly a party devoted to free trade andthe gold standard, while the Republican Party stood squarely for a protectivetariff and was more amenable to inflationist experimentation. Put very simply,the Democrats were particularly congenial to and influenced by Wall Streetinvestment bankers, notably the Morgan interests and by the EuropeanRothschilds, acting through their New York agent, August Belmont, who was formany years national treasurer of the Democratic Party. The Republicans, on theother hand, were more susceptible to the influence of manufacturers seeking aprotective tariff, in particular Pennsylvania iron and steel men, who had beenin the forefront of the struggle for high tariffs ever since 1820. One of themain leaders of the Republican Party during the Civil War and the immediatepost-war years was Representative Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania ironmanufacturer, and a leading proponent of the protective tariff as well asirredeemable Greenback money.[1] [part0014_split_001.html#fn1]The two Democratic administrations of Grover Cleveland were heavily influencedby the Morgans and allied Wall Street interests. Cleveland himself got his startas a railroad lawyer in Buffalo, including for Morgan-affiliated railroads suchas the New York Central. In between terms Cleveland became associated with thepowerful New York City law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeagh. Theoriginal senior partner of the firm was Charles E. Tracy, J.P. Morgan’s brotherin law. After Tracy died in 1887, Francis Lynde Stetson became the main partner.Stetson was Cleveland’s close friend, political advisor, and Wall Street lawassociate at the firm, and was also the counsel to J.P. Morgan & Co. Cleveland’smajor political organizer and Secretary of the Navy in his first cabinet was thebrilliant Wall Street financier William C. Whitney, who was affiliated withvarious railroad interests and later served as the director of several Morgancompanies. Whitney’s daughter was later to marry Morgan partner Willard D.Straight. But Whitney was doubly blessed by being also closely associated withStandard Oil and the Rockefellers, a mainly Republican family, as his brother inlaw Oliver H. Payne was a close associate with Rockefeller in the ownership ofStandard Oil. His first Secretary of War was the Boston Brahmin William C.Endicott, who had married into the wealthy Peabody family. George Peabody hadestablished a banking firm which included J.P. Morgan’s father as a seniorpartner; and a Peabody had been best man at J.P.’s wedding.Another leading Cleveland associate was the prominent Boston attorney RichardOlney, Attorney-General and then Secretary of State in the second Clevelandadministration. His first Secretary of State was Thomas F. Bayard, who hadstrong ties to August Belmont, allied to the Morgans and Rothschilds, andAugust’s son Perry worked for Bayard in Congress. Before assuming office, Olneywas the counsel to the Morgan affiliated Boston & Maine Railroad, as well as tothe Burlington Railroad. Other Cleveland advisers included Morgan himself,Stetson, and August Belmont Jr., himself a Rothschild agent.After he left the presidency, Grover Cleveland was, at the suggestion of J.P.Morgan, made a trustee of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and participatedin stock speculation with Whitney and Oliver Payne.[2][part0014_split_001.html#fn2]If the Cleveland administration was heavily Morgan-tinged, the Republican Partyand the McKinley administration was even more under the domination of John D.Rockefeller and Standard Oil. In the House, the powerful Speaker Thomas B. Reedof Maine was an old and close friend of Henry H. Rogers, an early associate ofRockefeller and one of the major owners of Standard Oil. The unquestioned bossof the New York Republican Party was Thomas C. Platt, an old friend andschoolmate of John D. Rockefeller’s at Owego High School in upstate New York.Dominating the Senate from his post as head of the Finance Committee was NelsonW. Aldrich of Rhode Island, arch-protectionist and father-in-law of John D.Rockefeller, Jr. Aldrich entered the Senate in 1881 as a moderately prosperouswholesale grocer, and then, after 30 years of devotion to the public service, hedied a multimillionaire.Throughout his career in Congress, William McKinley of Ohio was associated withthe cause of protectionism. Devoted in particular to Ohio iron manufacturing,McKinley was born into an iron-mongering and therefore protectionist family.McKinley’s political and financial mentor, who engineered his political careerand his presidential nomination and saved him from bankruptcy while Governor ofOhio, was Marcus Alonzo Hanna, coal operator and iron manufacturer. A businessassociate as well as an old friend and classmate of Rockefeller at Central Highin Cleveland, Hanna was John D.’s conduit to influence over the Ohio and thenational Republican Parties. As soon as McKinley became president, he had theOhio legislature make Mark Hanna Senator from Ohio; other Senators from thatstate were once Henry B. Payne, father of the Standard Oil partner, and thenewly elected Joseph B. Foraker, who as a Senator was a recipient of StandardOil stipends.McKinley’s cabinet reflected a strong Rockefeller Standard Oil influence. HisSecretary of State was the veteran Ohio Republican John Sherman, whom Hanna hadbacked for the presidential nomination a decade earlier and who currently tookhis Senate position. Sherman’s son-in-law was a former financial advisor toRockefeller. Secretary of Treasury was Lyman J. Gage, close to theRockefeller-controlled National City Bank and previous president of the FirstNational Bank of Chicago, who, after leaving the Cabinet, became president ofthe Rockefeller-controlled United States Trust Co. Gage’s hand-picked assistantat the Treasury, Frank A. Vanderlip, later moved to the Rockefeller-controlledNational City Bank, eventually becoming its president. His second Ambassador tothe Court of St. James was Joseph H. Choate, distinguished attorney for StandardOil. Secretary of the Navy was John Davis Long, who was later appointed to be adirector of the United States Trust Co. while still in office.Driven from their Democratic home by the victory of the Bryanites, the Morganinterests backed the prominent Wall St. banker Levi P. Morton, governor of NewYork and former vice president, for the Republican presidential nomination in1896. Defeating Morton and refusing him another turn at the vice presidency,McKinley made amends to the Morgans by picking as his running-mate Garret A.Hobart. Hobart had the bad taste to continue in his posts as director of aMorgan dominated bank, an insurance company, and a railroad even while vicepresident. In addition, William McKinley eventually granted the War Departmentcabinet post to Elihu Root, a brilliant attorney for Ryan and then for J.P.Morgan. Moreover, McKinley’s Secretary of the Interior was Cornelius N. Bliss,close associate of Morgan and Ryan, and a director of the Equitable LifeAssurance Society. In McKinley’s second term, the Attorney-Generalship wasgranted to Philander C. Knox of Pittsburgh, who served as counsel for thenation’s leading steel manufacturer Carnegie Steel which was to help form U.S.Steel, which was in turn also dominated by Morgan. Knox was a close friend andassociate of Andrew Carnegie’s partner and right-hand man, Henry Clay Frick, anda director of the great Pittsburgh banks of the House of Mellon. It was Frickwho personally urged McKinley to name Knox to the Attorney-General post.In September, 1901, early in President McKinley’s second term, a fateful eventoccurred which changed the face of American politics. One of the several “lonenuts” who have suddenly appeared in American history to assassinate an Americanpresident gunned down William McKinley, and the brilliantly craftedMcKinley-Hanna-Rockefeller regime crumbled into dust. For, as fate would haveit, his successor was the colorful young New Yorker Vice President TheodoreRoosevelt, beholden to a very different and clashing set of financial interests.The first—and the quintessential—“progressive” American president had beencatapulted into power.[3] [part0014_split_001.html#fn3]2. T.R.: THE MAKING OF A PROGRESSIVETeddy Roosevelt was America’s first progressive president and it was during hisadministration that progressivism began to take shape as a political force, onthe urban and state, as well as federal, levels.An aristocratic New Yorker, Roosevelt went to Harvard, and there married intothe top Brahmin families of the Boston financial oligarchy. His first wife,Alice Lee, was the daughter of George Cabot Lee, and was related to the Cabots,Lees, and Higginsons (the latter of the Boston investment banking firm of Lee,Higginson & Co.). The Boston financial group was generally allied to the Morganinterests. In Boston, he gained a lifelong friend and close political mentor,the rising young politician Henry Cabot Lodge, also a member of the Cabotfamily.After a stint as New York Assemblyman, the death of his first wife and a bitterbreak with his reform friends on his supporting the Republican ticket in 1884,Roosevelt moved west to his South Dakota ranch. Returning to New York, he wasbadly beaten for the mayoralty of New York City in 1886, and he retired towriting historical works. It seemed that, at the age of 28, Teddy Roosevelt’spolitical career was already at an end.But in 1889, the new President Benjamin Harrison was induced by the powerfulCongressman Henry Cabot Lodge to appoint Teddy Roosevelt head of the CivilService Commission. So ardent was Roosevelt in this post that he was reappointedby the Democratic president Grover Cleveland.[4] [part0014_split_001.html#fn4]In addition to a strong nationalist policy, devotion to militarism and a largenavy, and to a Republican protective tariff, Roosevelt had long called for anever-greater strengthening of the civil service system. Here, he joined theprincipal “reform” cause in the decades after the Civil War, a cause thatprefigured the later progressive call for taking “politics” out of government.Civil service reform was the first proto-progressive cause to blend moralisticattacks on “corruption” with a supposedly scientific plea for “efficiency” andnon-partisanship in government. The idea was to end or limit the “spoils system”by taking ever more government jobs out of politics, freeing bureaucrats intheir posts, and making hiring and promotion subject to “objective” writtentests of “merit” rather than political party or ideology.The civil service system, however, which began in force with the Pendleton Actof 1883, had vitally important but unacknowledged effects. For the consequencewas to build and preserve a continuing ruling oligarchy that was not subject tothe democratic check of the voting public. “Non-partisanship” and civil service“protection” meant the fastening of a permanent bureaucratic elite upon thehapless public. It paved the way for rule by the expert rather than by politicalrepresentatives. And there was another built-in consequence of civil service. IfParty A appoints its members and then freezes them in place via civil service,this meant that, when Party B came into power, it could no longer find jobs forthe party faithful in the good old way of ousting the members of Party A.Instead, Party B could only reward its followers by creating new jobs which it,in turn, could freeze into civil service. In short, the advent of civil servicebrought a powerful incentive for either party to multiply the number ofgovernment officials and bureaucrats.[5] [part0014_split_001.html#fn5]In 1895, Roosevelt was made president of the Police Board of New York City. Theblustering Roosevelt immediately began to make his mark in a way that wasbecoming standard for “reform” politicians: a pietistic crackdown on liquor andSunday business. Specifically, T.R. began a ferocious enforcement of theRepublican-sponsored Raines Law, which mandated Sunday closing for liquor storesand saloons. The crackdown was particularly effective against neighborhoodsaloons and beer gardens, the latter the habitual Sunday entertainment ofGerman-Americans. As a not unintended consequence, the result was a crippling ofthe political power of the saloonkeepers, the major political influence inliturgical-ethnic neighborhoods, and also habitually the bulwark of the urbanDemocratic Party.Soon Germans protested against the Raines Law in New York City, and the LiquorDealers’ Association claimed that 90% of the saloonkeepers had been driven intobankruptcy by Roosevelt’s rigorous prosecution of the law. Even thereform-fusion Mayor, William L. Strong, who had appointed the unpopular policecommissioner, stated at a public dinner: “I found that the Dutchman [Roosevelt]whom I had appointed meant to turn all New Yorkers into Puritans.”[6][part0014_split_001.html#fn6] The Mayor urged T.R.—in vain—to relax hisenforcement of the law, while Roosevelt was denounced and threatened, and a bombwas sent to him in the mail. The Chairman of the Republican County Committee inManhattan went so far as to read T.R. out of the party in a desperate attempt tohold the German-American vote. But, with Roosevelt holding fast, the RepublicanParty went down to a crushing defeat in the ensuing election, with 30,000German-Americans bolting to the Democratic Party. The state legislature thenmanaged to revive saloons by authorizing the sale of liquor in hotels servingmeals, an act which spawned a host of new pseudo-hotels and saloons,institutions which Roosevelt found he could not effectively stamp out.[7][part0014_split_001.html#fn7]In 1896, Roosevelt and his friend Senator Lodge backed the pro-gold standardSpeaker of the House Thomas B. Reed of Maine for president, and we have seen therole that Lodge played in forcing the Morgan-Wall Street pro-gold standard plankupon William McKinley. After McKinley’s election, Roosevelt returned to thefederal arena. At the insistence of Lodge and of T.R.’s good friends, Cincinnatimillionaires Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy Storer, who had helped to bail McKinley out ofbankruptcy four years earlier, Roosevelt was made Assistant Secretary of theNavy.All his life Theodore Roosevelt had thirsted for war—any war—and military glory.In 1886, hearing of possible conflict with Mexico, Roosevelt offered to organizehis South Dakota ranch hands into a cavalry battalion to lead against thatcountry. In 1892, Roosevelt hailed U.S. demands for Chilean indemnity forinjuries to U.S. sailors at Valparaiso, and he dreamt of leading a cavalrycharge. Two years later, he demanded annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and theconstruction of a Nicaraguan canal. In 1895, T.R. lauded President Cleveland’shawkish anti-British position in the Venezuela boundary dispute, and he lookedforward to war with Britain as a means of conquering Canada. That year, he wroteto Lodge that “... This country needs a war,” which incited reformer andPresident Charles W. Eliot of Harvard to denounce Roosevelt’s “doctrine ofjingoism, this chip-on-the-shoulder attitude ... of a ruffian and a bully,” andclaimed that Roosevelt and Lodge were “degenerated sons of Harvard.” Rooseveltin turn grouped together Eliot and reformer Carl Schurz with “the futilesentimentalists of the international arbitration type,” who would lead to “aflabby, timid type of character, which eats away at the great fighting qualitiesof our race.”Now, as Assistant Secretary, Roosevelt called for the building of morebattleships and dreamt of war with Japan and the annexation of Hawaii.Representative Thomas S. Butler of Pennsylvania, a member of the House NavalAffairs Committee in 1897, wrote that “Roosevelt came down here [to Washington]looking for war. He did not care whom we fought as long as there was ascrap.”[8] [part0014_split_001.html#fn8] Also yearning for war per se were thescholars, theoreticians, and politicos of T.R.’s circle: Senator Lodge, theBrahmin historian Brooks Adams, Ambassador to Great Britain John Hay, and T.R.’snaval mentor, Captain Alfred T. Mahan. Roosevelt’s friend Justice Oliver WendellHolmes, Jr. held war to be “divine” and held that the United States needed warto substitute danger for comfort.After the U.S. battleship Maine exploded in the Havana harbor on February 15,1898, Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, leaving the office for the day onFebruary 25, warned the impetuous jingo Roosevelt not to take “any stepaffecting the policy of the administration without consulting the President orme.” Instead, T.R. seized the opportunity to violate these instructions and tochange American policy by sending a fateful telegram to Commodore George Dewey,ordering Dewey’s squadron out of Hong Kong and, in the event of war with Spain,to blockade the Spanish fleet on the Asian coast and then to proceed tooffensive operations in the Philippines. While Secretary Long was furious, hefailed to countermand T.R.’s telegram, so when the U.S. went to war in April,Dewey sailed to Manila Bay and eventually the U.S. conquered the Philippines.[9][part0014_split_001.html#fn9]When war came, Teddy Roosevelt at last found the military action he had lustedfor all his life. With his equally pro-war friend Colonel Leonard Wood, T.R.formed the First Volunteer Cavalry, the “Rough Riders.” T.R.’s and the RoughRiders’ military prowess in Cuba was less than overwhelming; indeed, Rooseveltdisplayed a penchant for charging his men into ambush and absorbing extremelyheavy losses. But although getting ambushed or surrounded twice and losing overa quarter of his men, Teddy Roosevelt managed to emerge elated and to parlay hismilitary exploits into public legend.[10] [part0014_split_001.html#fn10]Back from the war, Roosevelt was urged upon the Republican Party as agubernatorial candidate by the powerful Chauncey M. Depew, president of theMorgan-controlled New York Central Railroad. T.R.’s campaign was heavilyfinanced by the Morgan-controlled Mutual Life Insurance company, along withother insurance companies, while J.P. Morgan apparently gave the campaign$10,000.[11] [part0014_split_001.html#fn11] T.R. ran his successful campaignstrictly upon the issue of the war and his Rough Riders, denouncing theDemocrats as being unpatriotic for giving reluctant support to the war anddemanding that the United States must help its new conquests because “our flaghas gone” to these lands.[12] [part0014_split_001.html#fn12]Teddy Roosevelt’s term as governor has, until recent years, been neglected byhistorians, but now it is realized that his policies as governor prefigured hisimmediately succeeding years in the presidency.[13][part0014_split_001.html#fn13] Roosevelt moved quickly on his long-time favoritefront, the extension of civil service. Working closely with George McAneny,secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association, Roosevelt drove through acivil service expansion greater than any other previously obtained in the UnitedStates.In collaboration with labor union leaders, social workers, and wealthy MidwestBaptists, Roosevelt urged putting more teeth in labor laws, centralizing andexpanding the enforcement. In addition, the maximum 10-hour-per-day labor lawwas expanded to all women workers. Industrial establishments in residentialhomes were cracked down on by imposing licensing laws and by permitting factoryinspectors to enter all shops without restriction. Such laws were designed torestrict labor competition, and—in the name of repressing “sweatshops”—suppressefficient competition to the larger and more politically powerful enterprises.Roosevelt also urged a larger governmental role in tenement housing. The drivefor repressing and regulating tenement housing was largely an upper- andmiddle-class, as well as pietist, concern for the morals—for the “vice” and the“corruption” amidst the ethnic poor of the tenements. The upper-class guardianof the morals of the poor, Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, successfully urgedGovernor Roosevelt to expand the vagrancy law, a meat-axe available to coercepeople without visible means of support, and to round up and punish pimps. Then,at the behest of Methodist Bishop Henry Codman Potter and reform Republican F.Norton Goddard, Roosevelt put through further legal restrictions on the numbers“racket” and on any prize fighting for a fee. The new anti-numbers law went sofar as to make it a misdemeanor even to possess a policy slip, while the ban onprize fighting was bitterly opposed by Tammany Hall, the leader of the New YorkCity Democracy. Both repressive measures passed the legislature. Furthermore,Roosevelt put through a bill for a state tenement house regulatory commission,which in turn put through a new housing code in 1901 that soon became a modelfor all the states in the nation. The code, which restricted the supply of newhousing, and thereby raised costs in the name of higher quality, was put throughby a commission of such wealthy reformers and social workers as I.N. PhelpsStokes, James B. Reynolds, Robert W. DeForest, and corporate lawyer Paul D.Cravath.[14] [part0014_split_001.html#fn14]Theodore Roosevelt was to be the first president dedicated to governmentconservation of public land, timber, and other natural resources. Theconservation movement has always enjoyed an uncritical “press,” it being almostalways assumed that conservationists can only be motivated by disinterested loveof nature. In fact, the conservation movement, as we shall see further below,has been an alliance of elitist groups, one part of that coalition upper-classpeople who wish to repress further growth and thereby preserving both their ownenclaves of wealth and the natural scene around them, while others have beenprivate real estate, timber, and other interests, such as railroads, who wish tokeep potentially competing public land and natural resources off the market,thereby maintaining and raising the value of their own assets and income. Afinal and crucial part of the coalition are the experts and technocrats, theprofessional bureaucrats and managers of the natural resources.[15][part0014_split_001.html#fn15]The aristocratic hunter and sportsman Teddy Roosevelt had organized the Booneand Crockett Club, the premier advocates of forest conservation, at his home in1887. The Boone-and-Crocketters were devotees of the “scientific forestry”schemes of wealthy young New York forester Gifford Pinchot, a member of the Cluband, after 1898, Chief of the U.S. Division of Forestry.[16][part0014_split_001.html#fn16] Governor Roosevelt’s two leading advisers onconservation were disciples of Pinchot: C. Grant La Farge, who persuadedRoosevelt to turn to Pinchot for advice on the forestry section of his messageto the legislature, and James MacNaughton, representative of the McIntyre IronAssociation, owner of 90,000 acres of Adirondack forest land. Pinchot’s cozyrelations with private timber interests were typified by his offer to use theservices of his Forestry Bureau to aid private timber owners in managing theirforests.At the behest of Pinchot and of the Boone and Crockett Club, Governor Roosevelturged the legislature to centralize the five–man state forest, fish, and gamecommission into a one-man agency. The plan was to succeed after Roosevelt leftoffice; in the meanwhile, he appointed as head of the board the president of theBoone and Crockett Club, W. Austin Wadsworth, wealthy landowner andsportsman.[17] [part0014_split_001.html#fn17]A particularly important pre-figuring of progressivism on a federal level wasGovernor Roosevelt’s attitude toward the “trust problem.” A major part of T.R’sannual message of 1900 was devoted to this question. As we have seen, 1898 and1899 saw a tidal wave of mergers and consolidations, generally known as“trusts”—in an attempt to achieve monopolies in each of the various industries.The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was considered a dead letter, and certainlynone of the merger promoters considered it a problem.The McKinley administration pursued a laissez-faire attitude toward the trusts,with Mark Hanna affirming that antitrust laws were a “war on corporations pureand simple” and a “war on business success.” In the fall of 1899, Hanna laudedthe writings of ex-labor leader and economist George Gunton, who had denouncedantitrust proposals as a “Crusade Against Prosperity.” Hanna’s reflection ofRockefeller’s laissez-faire views on trusts at the time is not surprising, andneither is the fact that Gunton was receiving subsidies from Standard Oil.[18][part0014_split_001.html#fn18]But Teddy Roosevelt and his financial allies were in the process of taking avery different line on the trusts. Roosevelt turned for advice to threedistinguished economists, each of whom were taking in various ways apro-government cartelist, rather than a laissez-faire position. One was theColumbia University professor, Edwin R.A. Seligman, of the distinguishedinvestment banking family of J. & W. Seligman; another was President ArthurTwining Hadley of Yale. A third was Jeremiah W. Jenks, Cornell Universityprofessor and chief advisor to the U.S. Industrial Commission, a federal blueribbon panel investigating the trusts. A key adviser was Secretary of War ElihuRoot, once and future Ryan and Morgan lawyer.Roosevelt emerged from these consultations determined to move toward governmentregulation and cartelization of the trusts and of corporations generally. In aspeech in late September, 1899, Roosevelt urged the regulation of trusts firstthrough compulsory publicity, then, if necessary, through taxation, and finallythrough licensing. Trusts and the accumulation of wealth were perfectlylegitimate, Roosevelt was soon to hold, but regulation was needed when fortuneswere acquired in a predatory manner.[19] [part0014_split_001.html#fn19]Jenks and Seligman had long been members of the “new school” of economics which,over a decade earlier, had frankly repudiated the idea of laissez-faire in favorof increasing state control of the economy. In the course of favoring theestablishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, Seligman hadwritten:> We must recognize the monopolies as existing facts, but hold them under> control. ... Competition has had its day and has proved ineffective. Let us be> bold enough to look the facts straight in the face and not shrink from the> logical conclusions of our premises. Recognize the combinations but regulate> them.[20] [part0014_split_001.html#fn20]Arthur Hadley has been wrongly classified by historians as an advocate oflaissez-faire. But while not as eager to regulate railroads and industrialcombinations as some of his statist conferees, Hadley pioneered in theRooseveltian idea of compulsory publicity. In the mid-1880s, Hadley advocated afederal regulatory commission for the railroads, but one whose powers would beessentially confined to forced publicity. Similarly, coerced publicity was hisproposed remedy for industrial combinations.[21] [part0014_split_001.html#fn21]Compulsory publicity has a twofold cartelizing effect not generally understoodby the public. In the first place, as we have seen with the vigorous competitiveeffect of secret rebates by the railroads, secrecy is a great spur tocompetitive rivalry. If business firms can somehow engineer the coercing ofpublicity about their rivals, they will be able to know much more about theircompetitors’ affairs, their pricing and production policies, and hence cartelagreements, formal or informal, become far more enforceable and activecompetition may be crippled. Secondly, the cost of making reports and obeyinggovernment regulations puts an extra burden on small, new, and innovativecompetitors and hampers their chances of competing with existing and more staidlarge firms.After Governor Roosevelt’s speech in the fall of 1899, Jeremiah Jenks drew up abill for Roosevelt to submit to the legislature. Newly incorporated firms wereto be offered a lower tax in exchange for provisions for compulsorypublicity.[22] [part0014_split_001.html#fn22] Roosevelt then got Jenks to writea magazine article defending the bill, and induced leading state legislators toconfer privately on the bill with Jenks, with Francis Lynde Stetson, attorneyfor J.P. Morgan and Co., and with Victor Morawetz, an attorney for Morganrailroads.Due to the opposition of the Republican machine in New York State, theRoosevelt-Jenks bill failed to passage, but the stage was set for Roosevelt’strust policies as president of the United States.[23][part0014_split_001.html#fn23]The death of relatively unimportant Vice President Garrett Hobart in November,1899 left a vacancy in this No. 2 and previously Morgan post. Teddy Roosevelthad deliberately cultivated good relations with the press, and this blusteringand colorful figure was now boosted around the country for the vice presidentialspot. McKinley was opposed, however, and Mark Hanna was vehemently hostile toT.R., referring to him as “erratic,” “unsafe,” and “a madman.” After the veteranIowa Senator William Allison turned down a McKinley offer for the nomination,McKinley and Hanna offered the vice presidential spot to Secretary of theInterior Cornelius Bliss, a New York banker and Morgan-Ryan associate. Thisoffer was in the venerable tradition of the dominant faction in the partyoffering the second spot as a consolation prize to the subordinate faction.Bliss, too, refused, however, and then the president offered the post to hisSecretary of War Elihu Root, another powerful figure in the Morgan ambit. Butwhen Root too refused, McKinley was subject to the powerful pressures forRoosevelt from New York boss Tom Platt, close to the Mellon interests, andSenator Henry Cabot Lodge. Particularly powerful was the lobbying for Rooseveltby Morgan partner George W. Perkins, a close friend of both Hobart andRoosevelt. At last, McKinley and Hanna succumbed, and Teddy Roosevelt wasnominated as vice president.[24] [part0014_split_001.html#fn24]It is not surprising that as soon as the election of 1900 was over, TeddyRoosevelt gave a lavish dinner in honor of J.P. Morgan.[25][part0014_split_001.html#fn25] No such gift was ever more deserved. It was clearto everyone that the battle between Roosevelt and Hanna for the presidentialprize in 1904 had already begun. But all bets were off when a “lone nut” gunmanassassinated William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt fortuitously became presidentof the United States.3. T.R. AS PRESIDENT: THE “GOOD” TRUSTSTheodore Roosevelt’s first—and one of his most important—moves toward regulationin the presidency was presaged in his first message to Congress upon assumingthe presidency in December 1901. Reviving an old proposal for a new CabinetDepartment of Commerce and Labor, to serve as a means of subsidizing commerceand industry, Roosevelt spoke of the department having the power to investigatecorporations and to publicize their findings. Roosevelt also eyed a federalboard, like the ICC, to supervise industrial combination. His address wascleared with two good friends who were also Morgan partners, George W. Perkinsand Robert Bacon.Throughout the summer of 1902, Roosevelt peppered his speeches with calls forcompulsory publicity in order to curb business “evils.” He found a strong allyin Attorney-General Philander Knox, an attorney close to the Mellon interestsand Henry C. Frick, now a major shareholder in Morgan’s U.S. Steel. Knox urgedT.R. to establish a commission with compulsory powers to obtain information frominterstate corporations, and to report to the president, who, in turn could orcould not publicize the information as he saw fit. This provision appealed toRoosevelt’s strong penchant for personal power, as well as to his commitment tocompulsory publicity.In early 1903, Roosevelt submitted a proposal to Congress to add to a previouslyproposed new Department of Commerce and Labor a Bureau of Corporations, theBureau to have full compulsory powers to “investigate the operations and conductof interstate corporations” and to convey that information to the president.[26][part0014_split_001.html#fn26]Prefiguring the Bureau of Corporations proposal was the U.S. IndustrialCommission, an investigatory body created by act of Congress in June 1898 toinquire into the economy, collect information, and recommend legislation toCongress. The Commission consisted of five Senators appointed by the vicepresident (the president of the Senate), five Congressmen appointed by theSpeaker of the House, and nine men appointed by the president with the consentof the Senate. The Commission issued 19 volumes of reports from 1900 until itsdemise in February 1902.The first chairman of the Industrial Commission, Senator James H. Kyle of NorthDakota, was a Populist Senator from North Dakota and one of the most left-wingmembers of the Senate. But more significant than the official members of theCommission was the expert staff that did the actual investigating and guided itsdeliberations. All of them were of the new school of interventionist economists.Professor William Z. Ripley of Harvard, the Commission’s expert ontransportation, was to exult a decade later that the “foremost railroadpresidents of the United States [were] approving a policy of federal governmentregulation, which, when I approved it on paper ten years ago, was characterized[by] ... a leading railroad man ... as ‘pernicious.’”[27][part0014_split_001.html#fn27]Roswell C. McCrea, highly paced in the academic world as Dean of the WhartonSchool of Finance, was the Industrial Commission’s expert on taxes andtransportation. McCrea looked forward eagerly to a welfare state. TheCommission’s expert on labor and immigration was Dr. John R. Commons, perhapsAmerica’s leading progressive economist and hence its outstanding champion ofthe emerging corporate state. His role in the progressive movement will bedetailed more extensively below.[28] [part0014_split_001.html#fn28] Above all,the Commission’s authority on trusts and combinations was none other thanJeremiah W. Jenks, who therefore shaped the Commission’s recommendations in thisvital area.The Preliminary Report of the Industrial Commission, submitted in 1900, was athoroughly Jenksian document. The object of its recommendations was to preventcorporations or industrial combinations from deceiving investors or the public.Therefore, the Commission recommended compulsory reporting and data of all sortsto the stockholders, and to the government, and making the corporations subjectto government inspection. The Preliminary Report had the effrontery to claimthat “the purpose of such publicity is to encourage competition” when, as wehave seen, the point was precisely the opposite. Indeed, the Commission went onto cite what it considered the horrors of secret railroad rebates to shippersbefore the advent of the ICC as an example of monopolization. Hence, itsdetermination to do for general industry what the outlawry of secret rebates wassupposed to be doing for the railroads.[29] [part0014_split_001.html#fn29]The Final Report of the Industrial Commission in 1902, continued the previousrecommendations, and added a good deal more. It was recommended that federal andstate anti-trust laws be strengthened and enforced, with a particular crackdownon the “vicious practice of discrimination between customers”—that is, secret oropen price-cutting to one or more customers at a time. State legislation wasadvocated, such as Massachusetts’ new law regulating the floating of new stockissues, and a federal franchise tax, progressive in relation to earnings, wasrecommended on all interstate corporations. And, finally, as the kickoff to theofficial proposal for the Bureau of Corporations, the Commission recommendedsuch a Bureau for investigation, reports, and publicity, perhaps as apreparation for a compulsory federal incorporation law.[30][part0014_split_001.html#fn30]Angry that so many of the industrial mergers of the late 1890s had failed, theFinal Report of the Industrial Commission also demanded that the accountingprofession develop methods to “protect” investors from the alleged “watering” ofstock capital in the formation of the “trusts.” In reality, the watering was nota swindle, but a legitimate aspect of entrepreneurial activity. If the promotersof a particular trust or corporation are overoptimistic about its profits andestimate its future earning power—and therefore the current value of itsstock—too highly, well then, each investor is free to disagree with theseestimates. No one held a gun to the head of the investors in the failed trustcombinations of the 1890s. The paternalistic idea that government exists toprotect everyone from their own folly also meant, in this case, regulation tokeep out some usually new marginal promoters for the benefit of older andstronger competitors. The cause of regulation and cartelization was therebyfurthered.[31] [part0014_split_001.html#fn31]The nascent accounting profession leaped to the support of the IndustrialCommission’s strictures, as well as to its call for compulsory publicity andperiodic accounting audits, of all the trusts and corporations, for two reasons:the Industrial Commission proposals meant a great deal more work for theaccounting profession, and accountants were annoyed because “going concern”capitalization, such as what the trust promoters had engaged in, was necessarilya subjective procedure. The accountants’ penchant for “objective,” “scientific”measurement was offended by the fact that all estimates of future earning powerare necessarily subjective estimates. As Previts and Merino state, theaccountants “objected to ‘going concern’ capitalization procedures becauseearning power could not be objectively measured.”[32][part0014_split_001.html#fn32] Perhaps so, but the capital values of anybusiness firm happen to be the discounted sum of expected future earnings ofthat firm, and those expected earnings, in the nature of reality and of themarket, are necessarily speculative and subjective. This might be unfortunatefor the “scientific” pretensions of some members of the accounting profession,but that is the way things are.[33] [part0014_split_001.html#fn33]President Roosevelt’s chief business ally in driving the Bureau of Corporationsbill through Congress was George W. Perkins, a Morgan partner and in the processof being Morgan’s right-hand man in forming the two giant “trusts,” UnitedStates Steel and International Harvester. Perkins agreed totally withRoosevelt’s conception of federal regulation of trusts. Like Roosevelt, Perkinsbelieved that there were “good trusts” and “bad trusts,” and, like T.R., hebelieved that his own U.S. Steel and International Harvester were conspicuousexamples of the good. So influential was Perkins in establishing the Bureau thatwhen the president signed the bill into law, he gave one of the two pens he usedto George Perkins.[34] [part0014_split_001.html#fn34]Only one important financial group stood opposed to the Bureau of Corporationsbill. In a way, it was strange, since three leading representatives of theStandard Oil trust, John D. Archbold, Henry H. Rogers, and John D. Rockefellerhimself, had all testified strongly in favor of a federal incorporation law andfederal regulation of corporate publicity before the U.S. Industrial Commission.John D. Rockefeller advocated that there be> First, Federal legislation under which corporations may be created and> regulated, if that be possible. Second, in lieu thereof, State legislation as> nearly uniform as possible encouraging combinations of persons and capital for> the purpose of carrying on industries, but permitting State> supervision ...[35] [part0014_split_001.html#fn35]But now, with Morgan ally Theodore Roosevelt at the helm, Standard Oil took avery different tack. Archbold lobbied heavily against the Bureau of Corporationsbill, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. sent telegrams to several key Senatorsagainst the bill. President Roosevelt demagogically seized the opportunity tohold a press conference deceitfully charging that the widely hated John D.Senior sent the telegram. It was to be the first shot in a savage war againstStandard Oil. Given T.R.’s ability to manipulate the press for his ends,Congress rushed to pass the bill in February 1903. T.R. promptly made hisprivate secretary, George B. Cortelyou, Secretary of the new Department ofCommerce and Labor and appointed as first Commissioner of Corporations youngJames R. Garfield, son of the late president and former staff attorney for theCivil Service Commission when Roosevelt served as its head. Before Garfield wasselected, his appointment was cleared with and approved by Francis LyndeStetson, attorney for the House of Morgan, and fellow alumnus with Garfield fromWilliams College.After a year or more of operation, business was quite content with Garfield’sadministration of the Bureau. In his annual December 1904 message to Congress,T.R. declared that the Bureau had “been able to gain not only the confidence,but, better still, the co-operation of men engaged in legitimate business.”Garfield himself, in the Bureau’s first report in the same month, declared that“In brief, the policy of the Bureau in the accomplishment of the purposes of itscreation is to cooperate with, not antagonize the business world; the immediateobject of its inquiries is the suggestion of constructive legislation, not theinstitution of criminal prosecutions.” Garfield also pleased most bigbusinessmen by coming out in favor of federal licensing of corporations, arecommendation that caused George W. Perkins to call up Garfield andcongratulate him warmly. Even John D. Rockefeller, Sr., so soon to feel thewrath of T.R., praised Garfield’s proposal, because “the Federal governmentwould scarcely issue its license to a corporation without at the same timeguaranteeing to its beneficiaries an adequate degree of protection.” ButRockefeller was soon to find out that, as far as Roosevelt was concerned,Standard Oil would not be a firm that he would be interested in“protecting.”[36] [part0014_split_001.html#fn36]In the same month, February 1903, as it passed the Bureau of Corporations bill,Congress also passed the Elkins Anti-Rebating Act of 1903 at the behest of theMorgan railroads trying to outlaw railroad rebates to shippers.[37][part0014_split_001.html#fn37] The satisfaction with which big business greetedRoosevelt’s policies on federal control of corporations and railroad rates wasembodied in an editorial of late December 1904 by the influential Wall StreetJournal:> Nothing is more noteworthy than the fact that President Roosevelt’s> recommendation in favor of government regulation of railroad rates and> Commissioner Garfield’s recommendation in favor of federal control of> interstate companies have met with so much favor among managers of railroad> and industrial companies.

In the end> it is probable that all of the corporations will find that a reasonable system> of federal regulation is to their interest.[38] [part0014_split_001.html#fn38]In 1904 and 1905, the Roosevelt administration entered into a cozy arrangementwith the two major Morgan-controlled trusts, International Harvester and UnitedStates Steel, both of them organized and supervised by T.R.’s close friendGeorge W. Perkins. In 1904, Garfield and Attorney-General William H. Moodyagreed to Harvester’s proposal that they would not prosecute any violations ofthe law provided that the company would conform in the future. In return,Harvester cooperated by giving any desired information to the Bureau; after all,as Harvester financier Cyrus H. McCormick told Garfield, “InternationalHarvester was in entire sympathy with some program of this sort.”[39][part0014_split_001.html#fn39]There matters lay until, in December 1906, Congress passed a resolution orderingthe Bureau of Corporations to investigate International Harvester. Harvester wasdelighted to comply. Meeting with Garfield and his deputy and eventual successorHerbert Knox Smith in January were Perkins, McCormick, and Harvester’s chiefspokesmen, Judge Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the board of U.S. Steel. Gary andRoosevelt had formed a close working relationship since 1902. Gary, seconded byPerkins and McCormick, told Garfield and Smith that “he believed in the work ofthe Bureau and the necessity of Governmental supervision of large corporations,and that he felt that the president and the Bureau, representing his policy, wasa strong safeguard both to the removal of abuses and to the prevention ofviolent attacks on private rights in general that might otherwise come.”Furthermore, they informed Garfield that a Bureau report would show that theywere operating in America at a loss, and “then they would have just ground forraising American prices.”[40] [part0014_split_001.html#fn40]Lo and behold, however, a threat appeared to this friendly arrangement.Attorney-General Charles Joseph Bonaparte, a patrician Baltimorean who had metRoosevelt as a young civil service reformer, insisted on bringing suit againstHarvester for some of its overseas activities. When Bonaparte failed to takeeven the hint of President Roosevelt to deter action until the Bureauinvestigation was complete, Herbert Knox Smith, former assistant head and nowthe head of the Bureau, wrote an impassioned letter to Roosevelt. The letterdetailed all the arrangements and understandings the Bureau had worked out withthe Morgan interests. Smith pointed out that “The attitude of the Morganinterests generally, which control this company, has been one of activecooperation,” and any prosecution would abandon the crucial policy ofdistinguishing sharply between “good” and “bad” trusts. Attacking the “economicabsurdity” and unenforceability of the Sherman Act, Smith pointed out thebeneficent alternative of federal regulation through compulsory publicity. Smiththen warned that “it is a very practical question whether it is well to throwaway now the great influence of the so-called Morgan interests, which up to thistime have supported the advanced policy of the administration, both in thegeneral principles and in the application thereof to their specific interests,and to place them generally in opposition.”[41] [part0014_split_001.html#fn41] Afew days later, Roosevelt ordered Bonaparte to drop the suit.U.S. Steel’s arrangement with the Roosevelt administration occurred a bit laterthan Harvester’s, but it was activated considerably earlier. In late 1904, inone of his frequent meetings with T.R., Judge Gary proposed to the president,that “If at any time you feel that the Steel Corporation should be investigated,you shall have an opportunity to examine the books and records of all ourcompanies, and if you find anything in them that you think is wrong, we willconvince you that we are right or we will correct the wrong.” To which thepresident replied, “Well, that seems to me to be about the fair thing.” Shortlythereafter, in January 1905, the House of Representatives ordered the Bureau ofCorporations to investigate U.S. Steel. In November, Gary, Henry Clay Frick,Garfield, and Roosevelt met at the White House and formalized the arrangement.U.S. Steel would cooperate with the government and supply information, while, ifthe president found a violation of law, publicity would be the only punishmentwielded against the company. Explaining to Garfield why he was willing to be socooperative, Judge Gary wrote that “the public utterances of the president, andyour statements to me from time to time, have been such as to show conclusivelyto my mind that there was no intention of doing or saying anything that wouldinjure our Corporation or disturb business conditions.” Garfield was delighted;here was “a long step ahead in fixing the work of the Bureau on the lines Iwish.”[42] [part0014_split_001.html#fn42]T.R.’s closeness to the Morgan interests may also be seen in several of his keyappointments. As Secretary of War, T.R. reappointed Elihu Root, an old andvalued friend and adviser, who had been a lawyer for the New York financier andMorgan ally Thomas Fortune Ryan and later for the House of Morgan itself, andalso served at various times as director of the Morgan-controlled National Bankof Commerce and Mutual Life Insurance Co. In 1904, Root left the Cabinet to aidJ.P. Morgan in reorganizing Equitable Life Assurance Company to direct Morgan’sinvestments in China and defend Morgan against T.R. in the Northern Securitiescase described below. The following year, Root was rewarded for his efforts bybeing appointed T.R.’s Secretary of State, the most powerful post in theCabinet. Root, indeed, was T.R.’s original choice as his successor, an offerwhich Root, perhaps because of the burden of his “Wall Street” image, refused.Root promptly appointed Robert Bacon, Morgan partner and old Harvard friend ofRoosevelt, as Assistant Secretary of State. When Root left office toward the endof T.R.’s term to become a New York Senator, the president made Bacon hisSecretary of State. In the last two years of his administration T.R. appointedGeorge von L. Meyer of Boston as his Postmaster-General. Meyer was an agent ofthe House of Morgan and a director of the Old Colony Trust Company of Boston.Secretary of the Navy during 1904 was Paul Morton, president of Equitable(Ryan-Morgan), and former vice president of the Morgan-dominated Atchison,Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, from which post he had advocated federalregulation and cartelization of railroads five years earlier. Serving for awhile as T.R.’s Assistant Secretary of the Navy was none other than Herbert L.Satterlee, J.P. Morgan’s son-in-law. Furthermore, Roosevelt made Elihu Root’slaw partner, Henry L. Stimson, Federal District Attorney of New York, and laterobtained for Stimson the Republican nomination for the governorship. Shortlyafter assuming office, Roosevelt appointed Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin to bePostmaster General. Payne was president of the Wisconsin Telephone Company and adirector of the North American Company, both Morgan concerns. Rooseveltappointed Payne to Postmaster General as an apparent way of weakening Hanna’sgrip on the national Republican Party. [43] [part0014_split_001.html#fn43]The one case that some historians raise as a counter-example to the closeaffinity between Roosevelt and Morgan was the Northern Securities case. Afterbattling fiercely for control of the Northern Pacific and other competingWestern railroads, the Morgan and the Edward H. Harriman-Kuhn-Loeb interestseffected a détente, forming the Northern Securities Company in 1901 as a holdingcompany for the merged railroads with an agreed-upon allocation of the stock.Without consulting Root or other advisers, and consulting only Attorney-GeneralPhilander Knox, in one of the first acts of his administration Roosevelt decidedto revive the virtually moribund Sherman Act and to launch an anti-trust suitagainst Northern Securities in February 1902.There is no question about the fact that Morgan was upset at the suit,especially about not being consulted or advised in advance. But this in itselfis no indication of a fundamental break between Morgan and the president.Morgan’s personal visit to Roosevelt over the suit has become famous, but itssignificance has been misconstrued. Morgan is supposed to have told T.R.: “If wehave done anything wrong, send your man [i.e., the Attorney-General] to my man[Morgan’s lawyer] and they can fix it up.” T.R. is supposed to have rejectedthis offer of détente, but to have gone on to assure Morgan that he was planningno further foray against U.S. Steel or any of the other Morgan trusts. AfterMorgan left, T.R. was supposed to have turned to Knox to observe that Morgan“could not help regarding me as a big rival operator, who either intended toruin all his interests or else could be induced to come to an agreement to ruinnone.”[44] [part0014_split_001.html#fn44]The main point, however, is that Roosevelt clearly agreed to Morgan’s deal. Or,at least, all of his subsequent actions, in and out of the presidency, supportsthis conclusion. For although the U.S. government won a technical victoryagainst Northern Securities in the Supreme Court’s decision of March, 1904, theupshot of the suit was not to injure either Northern Securities or the Morganinterests. Suffice it to say that only the formal device of the holding companyin this situation was banned. Overall,> The Northern Securities Case was a politically popular act, and it has> strongly colored subsequent historical interpretations of Roosevelt as a> trustbuster. It did not change the railroad situation in the Northwest, the> ownership of the railroads in that region, nor did it end cooperation among> the Hill-Morgan and Harriman lines.

The House of Morgan, in fact, was enoughsatisfied with Teddy Roosevelt’s performance in office to donate $150,000 toT.R.’s reelection in 1904.[47] [part0014_split_001.html#fn47]4. T.R. AS PRESIDENT: THE “BAD” TRUSTSConsidering later events, the Northern Securities case may have been, not abreak with Morgan at all, but the opening shot in Theodore Roosevelt’s war withMorgan’s great financial rival, E.H. Harriman. After the Rooseveltadministration leaked dark hints during the fall of 1906 about breaking up theHarriman railroad lines of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, Harrimanunderstandably linked this threatened persecution to his refusal to donate alarge sum of money to the Republican campaign that year. When one of Harriman’sattorneys, Maxwell Evarts, tried to intercede with the President Roosevelt burstout: “Well, you don’t know what Morgan and some of these other people say aboutHarriman.”[48] [part0014_split_001.html#fn48] The following spring, one ofHarriman’s employees stole a letter sent by Harriman to his chief counsel inlate 1905, expressing his disillusion with Roosevelt, with the sums of moneythat Harriman had contributed to Roosevelt and the broken promises that T.R. hadmade to him in return. The letter was published in the press, to which Rooseveltretorted by vilifying Harriman at a press conference, attacking him as adangerous “wealthy corruptionist.”An important clash of the Morgan and Harriman interests involving the Rooseveltadministration occurred in 1907. Morgan was intent on consolidating his controlof the entire New England railroad system under the aegis of his New HavenRailroad. In the spring of 1907, he accomplished the most important step in thisprocess: purchase by New Haven of the Boston & Maine Railroad. Before assumingfinal control, Morgan, Charles S. Mellen, president of the New Haven, and otherMorgan executives had an audience with Roosevelt where they won his approval ofthe merger, thus fending off any anti-trust suit. In addition to his generalaffinities with Morgan, one of Morgan’s key allies in this merger, was Lee,Higginson & Co., whose partner, George Cabot Lee, Jr., was a formerbrother-in-law of T.R.’s. The major opponent of the merger on the other hand,was E.H. Harriman, who himself was trying to acquire the Boston & Maine.But keeping up a hysterical drumfire of public criticism of the merger was thewealthy progressive Boston corporate lawyer, Louis D. Brandeis, who somehowmanaged to gain for himself, both in the press at the time and among historiansafterward, the reputation of being a “people’s advocate” removed from the sordideconomic interests of the day. In reality, as was fully known to his enemies atthe time, Brandeis was an attorney for Morgan’s great investment banking rival,Kuhn-Loeb, which in turn was the investment bank for the Harriman interests.When T.R., under public pressure, finally filed an anti-trust suit against theNew Haven-Boston & Maine merger in May 1908, Roosevelt’s old friend and majorpolitical mentor, Henry Cabot Lodge, long allied to the Morgan interests, wroteto T.R. informing him of the facts of life: namely, that Louis Brandeis wasreally a tool of Harriman and Kuhn-Loeb. In response, Roosevelt in effectdropped the suit.[49] [part0014_split_001.html#fn49]But the outstanding example of a “bad” trust, from T.R.’s point of view, wasStandard Oil. Roosevelt had never forgiven McKinley and Hanna—of the Rockefellerwing of the Republican Party—for stubbornly resisting his nomination for vicepresident in 1900. Then, the Rockefellers angered T.R., as we have seen, bylobbying against his Bureau of Corporations Bill. The Standard Oil people triedto induce Mark Hanna to run for the Republican nomination in 1904 against theupstart Roosevelt; but the Hanna boom, which much worried the president, was cutshort by Hanna’s death in the early part of the year. There is evidence that theRockefeller forces then swung their support to Judge Alton B. Parker, thecolorless Democratic nominee, who got roundly clobbered by Roosevelt in the 1904election.[50] [part0014_split_001.html#fn50]In Roosevelt’s second term, his first full term elected on his own, heconcentrated an assault on Standard Oil. From 1905 on, Roosevelt directed theBureau of Corporations to focus its attentions upon, i.e., to persecute,Standard Oil. In explanation, Roosevelt vindictively admitted many years later:“It [Standard Oil] antagonized me before my election, when I was getting throughthe Bureau of Corporations bill, and I then promptly threw down the gauntlet toit.”[51] [part0014_split_001.html#fn51] Another important consideration is thatMorgan’s hated foe, Harriman, was financially allied with the Rockefellers.[52][part0014_split_001.html#fn52]In 1906, President Roosevelt launched what can only be considered a savageprosecution of Standard Oil. It was the first really serious and major use ofthe Sherman Anti-trust Act as a weapon against industrial corporations. First,the Bureau of Corporations reported, in the spring of 1906, that Standard Oil,by accepting railroad rebates, had violated the cartelizing Elkins Anti-RebatingAct. In September 1907, the Roosevelt administration filed a far moreimportant—and ultimately successful—suit to dissolve Standard Oil under theSherman Act. When Standard Oil, alarmed, offered a détente, Roosevelt turned theidea down, for to T.R., both Standard Oil and Harriman were “setting the pace inthe race for wealth under illegal and improper conditions,” and were theembodiments of the “bad,” as contrasted to the “good” Morgan trusts.[53][part0014_split_001.html#fn53]Teddy Roosevelt’s motive for launching his brutal assault on Standard Oil havenot been fully explained by historians. His alleged hostility to trusts isbelied by his sharp distinction between “good” and “bad” ones, and the aligningof the Morgan trusts as good and Morgan’s opponents as bad.[54][part0014_split_001.html#fn54] Personal slights can hardly account for thepersistence of the hostility. Nor does the alignment of Roosevelt with Morganand the Morgan-Rockefeller division provide a satisfactory explanation per se.For these divisions had persisted for decades. The point is that previously, theRockefeller-Morgan contests were far more gentlemanly, and centered on suchissues as higher or lower tariffs. The sudden bringing of the anti-trust weaponout of a disused closet, and the use of it to go for the Rockefeller jugular,can only be explained by some new conditions—something new that might haveentered the Morgan vs. Rockefeller conflict and intensified it greatly.The origins of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 has, unfortunately, not beensubjected to the kind of withering revisionist analysis that Gabriel Kolko andothers have employed on the later regulatory measures of the ProgressiveEra.[55] [part0014_split_001.html#fn55] One thing is clear: conservative oldRepublican Senator John Sherman of Ohio can in no way be considered an opponentof big business. We do know that the Republican Party was increasingly underattack by the Democrats for their protectionist policies and that one of thecogent Democratic charges is that it was a high protective shield behind whichtrusts and cartels could form, free of at least external competition. Committedas they were to the protective tariff, the Republicans demagogically counteredthe argument by passing a measure supposedly designed to combat trusts. The factthat it was illogical to create a governmental shield for trusts and then usegovernment force to try to dissolve them, is not something that would long stopany politician who felt he could get away with the illogic.Furthermore, we know that the Sherman Act was rarely used by any of theadministrations, and that it sunk into innocuous desuetude by the time of theMcKinley administration. That it was designed as a sop to public opinion and totake the heat off the tariff therefore seems likely.But there was another motivation prompting Senator Sherman personally. Shermanhad been a candidate for the presidential nomination since 1880, and with thebacking of Mark Hanna, seemed to be winning his lifelong desire at theconvention in 1888. The frontrunner in the balloting until unexpectedly beatenby Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, the embittered Sherman blamed his defeat onMichigan Governor Russell Alger, one of his rivals for the presidentialnomination. Sherman publicly accused the wealthy Alger of bribing pledgedSouthern delegates away from Sherman at $50 a head, and there is considerableevidence that Sherman’s charge was not unfounded.It was only after his defeat that Sherman evinced a sudden interest in antitrustlegislation, particularly with regard to the hated Russell Alger’s monopolyDiamond Match Company, of which Alger “the Diamond Match King” was a principalfinancier. We know that Sherman read with great glee to the Senate, as anexample of a harmful monopoly, the full text of the Michigan Supreme Courtdecision in the case of Richardson v. Buhl and Alger (1889), in which the courtdeclared a specific contract between the organizers of the Diamond Match Companyto be unenforceable because it aimed at a monopoly in the match industry. And,significantly, it has been reported that when President Harrison signed theSherman Antitrust Act, he remarked to his aide, “John Sherman has fixed GeneralAlger.”[56] [part0014_split_001.html#fn56]To return to our central problem: was there any change in objective economicconditions that might account for a desire by the Morgan interests to trot outthe formerly innocuous Sherman antitrust weapon and launch a savage assault uponStandard Oil? The answer is yes: the eruption of the International Oil War.5. THE INTERNATIONAL OIL WARFor decades, American petroleum was the oil used by other countries in Europeand Asia, and by the early 1880s, Standard Oil had a virtual monopoly of refinedpetroleum exports, with kerosene for oil lamps as the major product. Then, inthe mid-1890s, the refinery financed by the Nobel brothers Robert and Ludvig, inBaku, Russia, began to challenge the exclusive Standard dominance of foreign oilmarkets. The Swedish Nobel brothers had by then built pipelines and steam-runoil tankers in Russia, and its Baku refinery in the Caucuses pioneered thecontinuous distillation process two decades before it would be adopted inStandard Oil refineries. By the mid-1880s, the powerful Rothschild Bank in Parisbegan to collaborate with the Nobels in production and refining, and also indelivering oil by railroad tank car from the Black Sea to the lucrative marketsin Western Europe.By the late 1880s, it was clear that Standard Oil was in for a fight; theNobel-Rothschild alliance was matching Standard markets in Western Europe withthe help of kerosene that was cheaper and of higher quality than the Americanproduct. Due to the growth of Russian and other foreign crude, the Americanproportion of the world’s crude oil output had fallen rapidly from 85% in 1882to 53% in 1888. Of the kerosene sold for export, about 90% of the Americanproduct was marketed by Standard Oil. Meanwhile, Russian crude production atBaku rose from 13% of the world’s output in 1882 to 38% nine years later.J.C. Chambers, American Consul in Batum, in the Caucuses, waxed livid inassessing the growth of Russian oil. Perhaps his anger was connected to hisdoubling as the eyes and ears of Standard Oil in the region. In his consularreports, in the late 1880s, Chambers charged the Russians with having a“quixotic ambition to drive the American oil from the markets of the world.” AndWilliam Herbert Libby, Standard Oil’s roving ambassador to the world, pinpointedthe “support of the Russian government” and of key European bankers inaccounting the meteoric rise of Baku oil.[57] [part0014_split_001.html#fn57]To counter the Nobel-Rothschild alliance, Standard set up its own aggressivemarketing affiliates and subsidiaries abroad. As a result, Standard’sAnglo-American Oil had captured 71% of the British oil import market by 1891. Bythe 1890s, the Nobel-Rothschild Russian interests had gained only a third of theBritish kerosene market and a fifth of Western Europe’s. Asia and Latin America,as well as the rest of the European market, were Standard Oil’s. Standard seemedsecure in its world dominance.In the early 1890s, Baron Alphonse de Rothschild offered a cartel arrangement toJohn D. Archbold of Standard Oil, with Rothschild being willing to guaranteeStandard 80% of the world oil market. What happened then is unclear. The offerwas surely tempting, especially since Standard’s proportion had by then fallento 70%. But nothing was achieved beyond a series of limited agreements from timeto time. The U.S. Consul General in St. Petersburg reported that thenegotiations broke down because the Russian Finance Minister, supporting theNobel-Rothschilds, refused to give his backing to such concessions to StandardOil. Or perhaps Harvey O’Connor is right that> The world was still Standard’s oyster; and while it was obliged reluctantly to> witness cheaper Russian markets, it was by no means willing to formalize any> such seizure through written agreement.[58] [part0014_split_001.html#fn58]But then there came into this idyll for the Rockefellers a cloud no bigger thana man’s hand. Aeilko Jans Zijlker, a Dutch tobacco planter, had discovered aremarkably productive oil well in northern Sumatra in 1885. In 1890, Zijlker,aided by Dutch financial interests, formed the Royal Dutch Company in Amsterdamto exploit the Sumatran oil. During the 1890s, Royal Dutch, managed by J.B.August Kessler, grew rapidly and began to compete sturdily with Standard in EastAsian markets. At the same time, Russian Baku oil began to compete in Asianmarkets. The problem had been transportation. In 1892, the Rothschild interestsgranted to the transport firm of Marcus Samuel & Company a commitment of tenyears supply of Russian kerosene to be shipped to the Far East. The Samuelbrothers and the London Rothschilds jointly managed to persuade the British-runSuez Canal board to allow oil tankers (previously considered too dangerouslyexplosive) to pass through the Canal.Samuel & Co. prospered, and in early 1898, it expanded to include a large numberof oil merchants in the great Shell Transport & Trading Company. Shell grewapace, snapping up highly productive Indonesian oil wells that had been unwiselyscorned by both Standard and Royal Dutch. Shell also invaded American crude oilmarkets, being considerably more farsighted than Standard in seeing theimportance of newly-discovered Texas crude, and contracted with Gulf Oil for itsproducts. Shell was aggressive, detested Standard Oil, and was ready for bear.As one outraged Standard exporter agent in Java reported back in 1899 aboutShell: “They advertise everywhere, loudly, broadly, and boldly about how theyare going to run the Standard Oil Co. out of Netherlands India, and have beendoing that steadily for the last four years until my ears are tired and sick ofsuch trashy rubbish.”[59] [part0014_split_001.html#fn59]But the growth of Royal Dutch was even more striking. Two Standard Oil experts,sent to survey the East Indies situation in 1897, were deeply impressed, writingback that “In the whole history of the oil business, there has never beenanything more phenomenal than the success and rapid growth of the R.D. Co.”[60][part0014_split_001.html#fn60] Accordingly, William H. Libby, during the years1895 to 1897, offered to buy out Royal Dutch and make it a marketing subsidiaryof Standard Oil. Unfortunately for Standard, it shortsightedly offered the RoyalDutch stockholders less than 94% of the current market value of their shares;and so Standard’s chance to recoup its dominance of the Asian market waslost.[61] [part0014_split_001.html#fn61]By 1901, the three world giants were eyeing each other hungrily but warily. Inthat year, Standard offered to buy out a majority of Shell stock, after which itproposed to take over Royal Dutch. The Rothschilds, however, were aiming at aShell merger with Royal Dutch in order to challenge Standard Oil throughout theworld. After the Dutch, too, rejected Standard’s offers, Royal Dutch’s newmanager, the young Hendrik August Wilhelm Deterding predicted that “before longit would have to defend its independence in a life-and-death struggle.” Thedynamic Deterding, who was eventually to become known as “the Napoleon ofpetroleum” was intensely hostile toward Standard, which he referred to in floridterms as “the abhorred ogre of the industry, pitilessly devouring all that isnewly-born.”[62] [part0014_split_001.html#fn62]A full merger between Shell and Royal Dutch was still not possible because ofpersonality conflicts between Deterding and Shell’s dominant owner Sir MarcusSamuel, the Lord Mayor of London. In 1902, the Asian sales of the two companieswere merged by setting up the new Asian Petroleum Company, with one-thirdownership each by Shell, Royal Dutch, and Baron de Rothschild. Deterding was tobe the manager, with Sir Marcus holding veto power over him as chairman of theboard. The result was a great upsurge in the fortunes of Royal Dutch in the FarEast. Finally, in 1907, Royal Dutch and Shell merged outright to form thepowerful Royal Dutch Shell group, run by Deterding, who now moved to London andwas dubbed Sir Henri by the British.It should be noted that a fierce international oil war between the two giantsbegan in 1902 and continued for many years thereafter, and that Shell had earlyformed an alliance with Mellon-run Gulf Oil in supplying it with Texas crude.Indeed, since the early 1890s, Mellon oil companies had competed with StandardOil for petroleum markets in Europe.[63] [part0014_split_001.html#fn63] Andsince the Morgans were long-time allies of the Rothschilds, could we notinterpret T.R.’s ferocious assault on Standard Oil as an integral part of theworld-wide oil war—a war assisted by former Morgan-and-Mellon lawyer, AttorneyGeneral Philander Knox?[64] [part0014_split_001.html#fn64]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0014_split_001.html#ft1] [Editor’s footnote] On the relationshipbetween protectionist iron manufacturers and greenbackism, see Rothbard, “AHistory of Money and Banking,” pp. 147–48.

[Editor’s remarks] Rothbard planned on devoting significantly more spaceto the evolution of foreign policy during the Progressive Era before World WarI, but unfortunately did not write it. In general, during this time there was atransformation from the laissez-faire “isolationist” foreign policy of theUnited States to a bellicose, interventionist, and paternalistic approach thatcreated an imperial empire in parts of South America and Asia to subjugate the“inferior” races. It is essential to understand that these ideas were notantithetical, but complementary to the entire progressive ideology. Thepresident’s powers were correspondingly strengthened, and the new empire wassupported by progressive economists and planners who were eager to get new jobsin planning and administering the new system. This included the “DollarDiplomacy” system, which was a gold exchange standard where dollars were thereserve currency used by the other subjugated countries.The transformation of foreign policy began in the second Clevelandadministration in South America, at the behest of bankers eager to subsidizeexport growth, prod open foreign markets, and diminish Great Britain’sinfluence. McKinley enormously accelerated this trend through the 1898 SpanishAmerican War, in which the United States took control of the Philippines,Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Roosevelt continued the expansion of militarismby cracking down on Philippine guerillas, instituting the Roosevelt Corollary,which expanded the more defensive Monroe Doctrine and declared that the U.S. hadthe right to directly intervene in Latin American countries, creating themachismo Great White Fleet, and the Morgan backed seizure of Panama fromColumbia by inciting a revolution. Taft, although less expansionist, maintainedthe new foreign policy by intervening in Cuba, Nicaragua, and the DominicanRepublic. Wilson embodied the fulfillment of the new imperialist executive stateby invading Mexico and other South American countries and enlarged U.S.imperialism to a world-wide level by getting involved in World War I.See Murray Rothbard, Wall Street, Banks, and American Foreign Policy (Auburn,AL: Mises Institute, 2011 [1984]), pp. 3–23 and “The Origins of the FederalReserve,” pp. 208–34.

Through nighttime inspections,urban city reformers also tried to clamp down on the “lodger evil,” where poorethnic immigrants would sublet their apartments in order to accumulate enoughsavings to later purchase a home. Zoning laws later came about with a similarpurpose to limit apartments to only families. Due to the regulations, by the1920s real estate developers shied away from low income housing, which then ledto calls for subsidies to construction companies or outright public provision.See David T.

The Commission also urged federal subsidies to agriculture, includingcartelizing agriculture through federal inspection of export products,especially meat, and the fixing of standard grades for cereals. It alsorecommended the establishment of a Pure Food and Drug section of the Departmentof Agriculture, with the power to outlaw the interstate shipment of “impure”food and drugs. It urged continuing the setting aside of the public domain forforest reserves, the conservationist taking of land out of use. The ICC was tobe strengthened and given the power to regulate railroad rates. The states wereurged to enact uniform laws prohibiting child labor, thereby raising wages forcompeting adult workers, and to pass anti-“sweatshop” laws and anti-truck lawscrippling small business competition. An eight-hour day for miners was urged,thereby helping to restrict entry of workers into the field and raising wagerates for the miners remaining. As a further subsidy to labor unions and aid torestrictionism of labor, Congress was urged to regulate the interstate movementof private detectives for strike-breaking, to repress the movement ofconvict-made products between states, and to draft codes for railway labor.

Against this,it is important to note that only the market can provide theoptimal—ascertainable only by demonstrated consumer preferences—level ofregulation, and it has institutional features to ensure that bad products aredriven from the market. Entrepreneurs are incentivized to provide reliable goodsin order to maximize long term profits, and consumers and investors learn theparticular attributes they care about through competitive advertising amongfirms. Product quality and working standards rise over time as entrepreneursincrease their savings and embark upon more roundabout processes of productionand engage in technological innovation. Regulation that raises qualityartificially stymies this crucial progressing process of the market, slows downthe rate of growth, and defies the preferences of consumers.

Regardless, Rothbard’s international motivation for explainingRoosevelt’s harsh attack on Rockefeller, which he at another time described asone which “there are no hard facts to prove it,” provides an intriguing globaldimension to the clash between the Morgan and Rockefeller financial groupsduring the Progressive Era and beyond. In a later unwritten chapter, Rothbardplanned to describe how Roosevelt’s successor in 1908, William Howard Taft,although put in by the Morgan ambit, was actually closer to the Rockefellerforces. As a result, in the middle of his presidency the Taft administrationstarted to initiate antitrust suits against Morgan companies, in particular U.S.Steel and International Harvester, as retaliation for the Roosevelt assault onRockefeller interests. Therefore, in order to deny Taft reelection in 1912 theMorgan interests formed the Progressive Party and put Roosevelt on the ticket.This heavily pietist, intellectual, and Morgan-laden party was able to deny Taftreelection and allow for the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson, to win theWhite House.

THE MEAT PACKING MYTHOne of the earliest acts of Progressive regulation of the economy was the MeatInspection Act, which passed in June 1906. The orthodox myth holds that theaction was directed against the “beef trust” of the large meat packers, and thatthe federal government was driven to this anti-business measure by popularoutcry generated by the muckraking novel, The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair, whichexposed unsanitary conditions in the Chicago meat-packing plants.[1][part0015_split_001.html#fn1]Unfortunately for the myth, the drive for federal meat inspection actually beganmore than two decades earlier and was launched mainly by the big meat packersthemselves. The spur was the urge to penetrate the European market for meat,something which the large meat packers thought could be done if the governmentwould certify the quality of meat and thereby make American meat more highlyrated abroad. Not coincidentally, as in all Colbertist mercantilist legislationover the centuries, a governmentally-coerced upgrading of quality would serve tocartelize—to lower production, restrict competition, and raise prices to theconsumers. It, furthermore, socializes the cost of inspection to satisfyconsumers, by placing the burden upon the taxpayers instead of on the producersthemselves.[2] [part0015_split_001.html#fn2]More specifically, the meat packers were concerned to with combating therestrictionist legislation of European countries, which, in the late 1870s andearly 1880s, began to prohibit the import of American meat. The excuse was tosafeguard the European consumer against purportedly diseased meat; the probablemajor reason was to act as a protectionist device for European meat production.Partly at the behest of the major meat packers, Chicago and other cities imposedand then strengthened a system of meat inspection, and the Secretary of theTreasury, on his own and without Congressional authorization, set up aninspection organization to certify exported cattle as free of pleuropneumonia in1881. Finally, after Germany prohibited the importation of American pork,ostensibly because of the problem of disease, Congress, responding to thepressure of the large meatpackers, reacted in May 1884 by establishing a Bureauof Animal Industry within the Department of Agriculture “to prevent theexportation of diseased cattle” and to try to eliminate contagious diseasesamong domesticated animals.But this was not enough, and the Department of Agriculture kept agitating foradditional federal regulation to improve meat exports. Then, in response to thehog cholera epidemic in the United States in 1889, Congress, again pressured bythe big meat packers, passed a law in the summer of 1890 compelling theinspection of all meat intended for export. But the European governments,claiming to be unsatisfied because live animals at the time of slaughterremained uninspected, continued their prohibitions of American meat. As aresult, Congress, in March 1891, passed the first important compulsory federalmeat inspection law in American history. The Act provided that all live animalsmust be inspected, and it managed to cover most animals passing throughinterstate commerce. Every meat packer involved in any way whatever in exporthad to be inspected in detail by the Department of Agriculture, and violationswere punishable by imprisonment as well as fine.This rigid inspection law satisfied European medicine, and European countriesswiftly removed their prohibition on American pork. But the European meatpackers were upset in proportion as their physicians were satisfied. Quickly,the European packers began discovering ever higher “standards” of health—atleast as applied to imported meat—and European governments responded byreimposing import restrictions. The American meat industry felt it had no otherchoice but escalating its own compulsory inspection—as the minuet of ever higherand hypocritical standards continued. The Department of Agriculture inspectedmore and more meat and maintained dozens of inspection stations. In 1895, thedepartment was able to get Congress to strengthen meat inspection enforcement.By 1904, the Bureau of Animal Industry was inspecting 73% of the entire U.S.beef kill.[3] [part0015_split_001.html#fn3]The big problem for the large packers was their smaller competitors, who wereable to avoid government inspection. This meant that their smaller rivals wereoutside the attempted cartelization and benefited by the advantage of being ableto ship uninspected meat. To succeed, the cartel had to be extended to, andimposed upon, the small packers.The much publicized “beef trust,” or cartel among the major packers to agree onprices and restrict production and competition, had indeed been in existencesince the mid-1880s. But in an industry with free entry and numerous smallproducers, and with meat growing in the hands of thousands of stock raisers, thebeef trust had no impact on meat prices. Moreover, the competition from smallmeat packers was increasing. During the 1880s, the number of meat packingestablishments in the United States had increased sharply from 872 in 1879 to1,367 ten years later. Under the impact of federal cartelization, the number offirms declined to 1,080 in 1899, but then competitive pressure increased, withthe number of firms rising to 1,641 in 1909, an increase of 52% in the firstdecade of the 20th century. Another gauge is that the meat packers other thanthe three largest firms accounted for 65% of meat production in 1905, and thepercentage rose to 78% in 1909.In March 1904, responding to pressure from organized livestock growers, theHouse of Representatives passed a resolution calling for the Bureau ofCorporations to investigate the alleged impact of the beef trust on prices andmeatpacking profits. The Bureau’s report, issued one year later, angered themuckrakers, populists, and livestock interests by pointing out, quiteaccurately, that the meatpacking industry was substantially competitive, andthat the packer cartel had no particular impact on meat prices.Until early 1906, all the popular agitation against the meat industry wasfocused on the alleged monopoly, and scarcely at all on sanitary conditions.Articles in English and American magazines in the previous two years attackingsanitary conditions in meatpacking houses had no impact on the public. InFebruary 1906, Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle was published and revealed manyalleged horrors of the meat packing industry. Shortly thereafter, Roosevelt senttwo Washington bureaucrats, Commissioner of Labor Charles P. Neill and civilservice lawyer James B. Reynolds, to investigate the Chicago industry. Thefamous “Neill-Reynolds” report that apparently confirmed Sinclair’s findings, infact, only revealed the ignorance of the officials, as later congressionalhearings indicated that they poorly understood how slaughterhouses worked andconfused their inherently foul nature with unsanitary conditions.Shortly after The Jungle came out, J. Ogden Armour, owner of one of the biggestpacking firms, wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post defendinggovernment inspection of meat and insisting that the large packers had alwaysfavored and pushed for inspection. Armour wrote:> Attempt to evade it [government inspection] would be, from the purely> commercial viewpoint, suicidal. No packer can do an interstate or export> business without Government inspection. Self-interest forces him to make use> of it. Self-interest likewise demands that he shall not receive meats or> by-products from any small packer, either for export or other use, unless that> small packer’s plant is also “official”—that is, under United States> Government inspection.> > This government inspection thus becomes an important adjunct of the packer’s> business from two viewpoints. It puts the stamp of legitimacy and honesty upon> the packer’s product and so is to him a necessity. To the public it is> insurance against the sale of diseased meats.[4] [part0015_split_001.html#fn4]Government meat inspection which also lures the public into always thinking thefood is safe and reduces competitive pressures to improve meat quality.In May, Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana, a leading Progressive Republicanand old friend of Morgan partner George W. Perkins, introduced a bill forstrengthening the compulsory inspection of all meat, including meat products andpreservatives, passing through interstate commerce, as well as fixing standardsfor sanitation within the meatpacking plants. The bill was vigorously supportedby Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson. The funds appropriated for federalinspection were quadrupled compared to the existing law, from $800,000 to $3million. The Beveridge bill passed both houses of Congress nearly unanimously atthe end of June.The large meat packers were enthusiastically in favor of the bill, designed asit was to bring the small packers under federal inspection. The American MeatProducers’ Association endorsed the bill. At the hearings of the House Committeeof Agriculture on the Beveridge bill, Thomas E. Wilson, representing the largeChicago packers, put their support succinctly:> We are now and have always been in favor of the extension of the inspection,> also to the adoption of the sanitary regulations that will insure the very> best possible conditions. ... We have always felt that Government inspection,> under proper regulations, was an advantage to the live stock and agricultural> interests and to the consumer ...[5] [part0015_split_001.html#fn5]One advantage to imposing uniform sanitary conditions on all meatpackers is thatthe burden of the increased costs would fall more heavily on the smaller than onthe bigger plants, thereby crippling the smaller competitors even further.The major battle over the Beveridge bill was who was to pay for the increasedgovernment inspection. The big packers, naturally enough, wanted the taxpayersto keep paying the costs as they had in the past. They also objected to thebill’s provision to compel canning dates placed on meat products, for fear ofdiscouraging consumer purchases of cans stamped at more remote dates. Thepackers’ objections were embodied in amendments by James W. Wadsworth, chairmanof the House Committee on Agriculture, amendments which were drafted by SamuelH. Cowan, attorney of the National Live Stock Association. When PresidentRoosevelt attacked the Wadsworth amendments after approving them privatelyearlier, Wadsworth answered him with “I told you ... that the packers insistedbefore our committee on having a rigid inspection law passed. Their life dependson it, and the committee will bear me out in the statement that they placed noobstacle whatever in our way ...”[6] [part0015_split_001.html#fn6]The House passed the Wadsworth bill and the Senate the Beveridge original, butthe House stood firm, and the big packers got all that they had wanted, the billbeing signed by the president at the end of June. The cans would not be dated,and the taxpayers would pay the entire cost of inspection. George W. Perkins wasdelighted, and he wrote to J.P. Morgan that the new law “will certainly be ofvery great advantage when the thing once gets into operation and they are ableto use it all over the world, as it will practically give them a governmentcertificate for their goods ...”The opposition to the Wadsworth amendment was scarcely based on anti-businessviews. Beveridge himself declared, quite sensibly, that “an industry which isinfinitely benefited by the Government inspection ought to pay for thatinspection instead of the people paying for it.” The same position was advancedby the New York Journal of Commerce.The leftish opponents of business were not fooled by the Beveridge-Wadsworthlaw. Senator Knute Nelson realized that the law was a meat packer’s bonanza:“Three objects have been sought to be accomplished—first, to placate thepackers; next, to placate the men who raise the range cattle, and, third, to geta good market for the packers abroad.” Even Upton Sinclair himself was notfooled; he realized that the new law was designed to benefit the packers; theintention of his expose, in any case, was not to impose higher standards formeat as it was to improve the living conditions of the packinghouse workers,which he himself admitted was scarcely accomplished by the new law. Hence hisfamous quote: “I aimed at the public’s heart, and by accident I hit it in thestomach.” Sinclair looked back on the event:> I am supposed to have helped clean up the yards and improve the country’s meat> supply—though this is mostly delusion. ... But nobody even pretends to believe> that I improved the conditions of the stockyard workers.Neither was Secretary of Agriculture Wilson under any delusions who favored oropposed the new law. Meeting with the large packers shortly after the billpassed, Wilson told them: “... the great asset that you gentlemen are going tohave when we get this thing to going will be the most rigid and severeinspection on the face of the earth.” To which the packers responded with “loudapplause.” Swift & Co. and the other large meat packers took out giant adstrumpeting the new law asserting that its purpose “is to assure the public thatonly sound and wholesome meat and meat food products may be offered forsale. ... It is a wise law. Its enforcement must be universal and uniform.”During the next few years, Senator Beveridge tried to restore the idea of thepackers paying for their inspection, but he got no support from Roosevelt andopposition from his Secretary of Agriculture. Meanwhile, the packers continuedto defend the Bureau of Animal Industry and its inspections, and they evensought unsuccessfully to strengthen inspection further.[7][part0015_split_001.html#fn7]2. HARVEY W. WILEY AND THE PURE FOOD AND DRUG ACTNeither was the Pure Food and Drug Act, passed on the same day as the MeatInspection Act, a triumph of the “people” over the “interests.” The pure foodagitation had been carried on for years by business interests in general, andspecifically by large food companies anxious to use the government in amercantilist way to cartelize, restrict competition, and impose higher relativecosts on small business competitors.In the early 1880s, the leadership of the drive for pure food legislation wastaken by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, the leading food chemist for the federalDepartment of Agriculture. Wiley combined in his person the leading forcesmaking for Progressivism and statism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries:an amalgam of pietism, of a technocratic drive by new corps of “experts,” and ofpowerful business interests.Harvey W. Wiley was born an Indiana farm boy to a father of Ulster Scotbackground who was a lay preacher in the pietistic Campbellite sect.[8][part0015_split_001.html#fn8] But more important than the specific sect to theWiley home was a non-sectarian and pietistic devotion to strict adherence to theSabbath. At Hanover College in Indiana, young Wiley began his lifelong obsessionwith “purity,” and began discoursing on the importance of purity of body, mind,and soul. He was early convinced that tobacco and pork were foul “impurities”that marred the perfection of one’s body.In his commencement address at Hanover in 1867, the 23-year old Wiley combinedthe themes of purity, pietism, and supposedly value-free medicine in ways thatwould foreshadow his later career. He declared that man must preserve hisGod-like “purity” of body and mind, and he exalted the nobility of thephysicians, men who “guard the holy covenant God made with man.” The physician,Wiley conceded, may not be able to make man immortal, but “he may help to makethe probation state [man’s life on earth] a proper place of preparation for theprecious life that beckons from beyond the misty hills ...”[9][part0015_split_001.html#fn9]Wiley then went to tutor in languages at Northwestern Christian University, aCampbellite university in Indianapolis, after which Wiley went to IndianaMedical College, acquiring an M.D. in 1871. Wiley then shifted to chemistry,becoming a professor of chemistry at Indiana Medical School the following year,then obtaining a B.S. in chemistry at Harvard, after which he became professorof chemistry at Northwestern Christian in 1873, followed by a professorship ofchemistry at the newly founded Purdue University in the following year.Five years later, Dr. Wiley studied medicine, chemistry, and physics at theUniversity of Berlin, where he was inspired by Dr. Sell’s government laboratoryfor the detecting of impurities in food and drink. It was at Berlin that Wileypicked up his lifelong interest in sugar chemistry and began his permanentalliance with the sugar industry and government in the U.S.In 1881, Wiley began to agitate for the government’s protection of the consumerfrom adulterated sugar products in the state of Indiana. Specifically, he calledfor a state requirement that sugar and syrup products be required to carrylabels detailing their composition. The compulsory labelling law would have hadseveral significant effects. By requiring compulsory publicity, it would crippletrade and brand-name secrets, thereby helping to restrict competition andcartelize the sugar industry. The law would also have the Colbertist ormercantilist effect of cartelizing through allegedly higher “quality” imposed onthe consumer by coercion.In addition, Wiley cemented his alliance with the sugar industry by agitatingfor the notion that the United States should be self-sufficient in sugar, andtherefore that imported sugar should be kept out of the United States by aprohibitively high tariff. His alliance with government began in 1881 whenIndiana passed a law regulating the manufacturer and sale of commercialfertilizers and named Dr. Wiley as the “state chemist” in charge of testingthese products.During the early 1880s, Wiley launched several abortive attempts to go into thesugar manufacturing business himself. He tried to buy a defunct beet-sugar plantin Boston to make glucose, a new product which he had lauded, and to organize aglucose plant in Indiana. Both of these failed. He also hoped to make sugar fromsorghum cane, and organized a small Indiana company to make preliminaryinvestigations on the subject, and he was happy enough with his results tobelieve it would be successful in the future.In an address before the Indiana State Board of Agriculture in January 1883, Dr.Wiley, by now one of America’s leading sugar chemists, made clear the extent towhich he was wedded to sugar. “Let me make the sweets of the nation and I don’tcare who makes the laws. ... The consumption of sugar is a measure of progressin civilization,” Wiley thundered, “Childhood without candy would be Heavenwithout harps.”[10] [part0015_split_001.html#fn10] Wiley added, with no trace ofirony, that “nothing is ever gained for a cause by an overstatement of itsclaims.” He also commended the possibilities for profit in the manufacture ofsugar from sorghum.At this point, the federal Commissioner of Agriculture fired as the departmentchemist the obstreperous and notoriously pro-sorghum Dr. Peter Collier. Toappease the politically powerful sorghum growers, the Commissioner was forced toappoint the notoriously pro-sorghum Harvey Wiley in 1883 as chief chemist.Wiley leaped to his new role, agitating at length for a protective tariff tokeep out efficient foreign sugar and to subsidize a domestic sugar industry intobeing. As a lifelong Republican in a Republican administration, Wiley was simplysingling out his own favorite tariff in a party wedded to the concept of keepingout imports in competition with American industry. Free trade, Wiley opined, wasbut “the tender tropical nursling of the college hot-houses and professionaldilettantism.” When asked what would happen to foreign sugar growers put out ofwork by an American protective tariff, Wiley displayed the arrogant attitudetoward Third World people typical of the Progressive. The native, Wiley opined,“sullenly lolling in the sun ... can look up and see cocoanuts and bananas; hewill not starve nor freeze.”[11] [part0015_split_001.html#fn11]In his scientific work for the Department of Agriculture, Wiley also devotedmuch time and energy to subsidizing the sugar industry, specifically a searchfor economic methods of producing sugar from sorghum, cane, and beet—especiallysorghum. Despite his eminence in the field, Wiley’s sorghum experiments duringthe 1880s were consistent flops. Congressional appropriations for these schemes,however, were repeatedly salvaged by the Republican Senator Preston B. Plumb ofKansas, who was subject to pressure by Kansas agriculturalists looking forsalvation by sorghum. Even Wiley’s seemingly successful diffusion process forLouisiana sugarcane turned out to be a failure. Wiley, however, continued to beenthusiastic about government subsidizing of sugar manufacture, and he alsoadvocated a governmental school to teach people the ways of sugar production.Neither consistent failure nor the changes in government, however, seemed todeter the federal government from continuing to finance and even expand Dr.Wiley’s activities. For one thing, Wiley proved early to be an expert maneuvererin the corridors of power. Although a Republican, Wiley was not ousted by theCleveland administration in 1885 because he managed to persuade Cleveland toappoint his old friend, farm editor Norman J. Colman, as the Commissioner ofAgriculture. Then, when Jeremiah Rusk, former governor of Wisconsin, becameSecretary of Agriculture under the Harrison administration, Wiley was able towork very closely with the new Secretary.The following year, 1890, Wiley and Rusk worked closely together with wealthyPhiladelphia financier Hamilton Disston. Disston had bought a million acres ofswamp and wetlands in Florida for the production of sugar cane, organizing theFlorida Sugar Cane Co. for that purpose. Disston then successfully lobbiedthrough Congress a grant to the Department of Agriculture of funds for researchin improving sugar cane production. The grateful Rusk and Wiley promptlyconstructed their experimental station on a site on Disston’s soil, only fourmiles from his sugar factory. Disston, of course, was only too happy to leasethe land for free to the Department of Agriculture, since the station could onlyboost the market for Disston’s sugar and his entire acreage.By the mid-1890s, it was clear to everyone that the idea of any sort of economicproduction of sugar from sorghum was a total failure, and that furthermore therewas no real domestic sugar industry of any consequence. Wiley, of course, blamedthe misfires neither on his grandiloquent attempts at subsidy nor on hisconsistent string of research failures; no, he charged, the problem was that thesugar tariff was not yet high enough.[12] [part0015_split_001.html#fn12]If one of Dr. Wiley’s lifelong passions was the promotion of American sugar, theother was the outlawry of food or farm products that he considered “impure.” Inthe decades after the Civil War, municipal boards of health had issuedordinances on pure milk and meat. More to the point, dairy interests forcedthrough protective laws in some states against competing milk or butterproducts, e.g. against such “adulterated” competitors as oleo-margarine. Farmersin many states tried to stop “adulterated fertilizers,” and we have seen thatDr. Wiley was enlisted in Indiana’s crusade as early as 1881. There were a fewstate food and drug laws, but they were enforced only in Massachusetts.On the federal level, there was only a pre-Civil War law banning the importationof adulterated drugs. In the mid-1880s, Dr. Wiley took the lead in agitating fora food and drug law on the federal level. In 1884, Wiley and several statechemists had organized the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, whichissued its reports in the Department of Agriculture’s Bulletins. Two yearslater, when Wiley was president of the Association, he induced it to expand itsscope from commercial fertilizers to the entire area of agricultural chemistry,including the adulteration of food.It should be noted that Wiley’s primary interest in this field was not insafeguarding the public health; it was in outlawing all changes in thedefinition of a product, since he considered all such changes in name as fraud.In short, Wiley sough to freeze the composition of all products in theiroriginal mold. It should be clear that such a law would not only cartelizeindustry and impose Colbertian mercantilism, but it would also cripplecompetition from new and imaginative innovators and freeze the status quo inindustry. That the motivation for this drive was economic was admitted byAgricultural Commissioner Colman, who wanted to eradicate food adulteration bymeans of tough state and federal laws. His “chief concern,” Anderson stated,“was the plight of the honest producer faced with the competition ofadulterated” products.[13] [part0015_split_001.html#fn13]The Department of Agriculture, Division of Chemistry, kicked off its campaignagainst impure food in its Bulletin #13, issued in 1887. To popularize itsfindings among the public, Wiley hired Alexander J. Wedderburn, farm editor,pure food enthusiast, and secretary of the legislative committee of the farmlobby group the Virginia Grange, to write Bulletin #25 in 1890. The Bulletin sawfraud everywhere, and particularly worried about the export markets which werebeing injured by the poor reputation of American food. Wedderburn’s Bulletincalled for national legislation to remedy the evil.Public agitation for a national pure food law, however, was not launched firstby Wiley and the Department of Agriculture. It was begun by Francis B. Thurber,a leading wholesale grocer in New York City. In the summer of 1880, Thurber gothis brother-in-law, Major Henry C. Meyer, editor of the Plumber and SanitaryEngineer, to persuade the National Board of Trade, the leading organization ofmerchants, to sponsor a $1000 contest in the PSE for the best essay draftinglegislation against food adulteration.The winner of the contest was Professor G.W. Wigner, president of theEngineering Society of Public Analysts; the judges of the contest then drafted amodel bill along Wigner’s lines, a bill then endorsed by the National Board ofTrade and many local boards. While the bill failed to pass, it served as themodel for numerous state laws during the 1880s.In late 1886, the American Society for the Prevention of the Adulteration ofFood, a Philadelphia-based outfit, called a national convention in Washingtonfor January 1887 to draft pure food legislation. The convention, representingcommercial organizations, trade journal and boards of health, endorsed the 1880Board of Trade bill. A larger convention the following year included foodmanufacturers and distributors and also endorsed legislation against harmfuladulteration and compelling the labelling of the composition of products. The1888 convention was led by the organized grocers, frankly, in order “to protectthe honest businessmen from the competition of the adulterator and to buildpublic confidence,” but it was also, as Anderson notes, “an attempt to capturethe initiative to the end that any legislation enacted would in objectives anddetails conform to the business point of view.”[14][part0015_split_001.html#fn14] Also heavily involved in the convention werenumerous agricultural interests. There were the dairy producers, who wantedprotection from such “fraud” as oleomargarine, corn and hog growers, who wantedprotection against adulterated lard and inspection of slaughtered animals forexport in order to prevent Europe from discriminating against them. As statedearlier, they succeeded with the 1891 law. And there were, of course, the publichealth professionals who wanted an expansion of their jobs and prestige.Specific agricultural interests managed to obtain governmental crippling oftheir competitors. In 1886, the dairy interests won a federal tax against themanufacture and sale of oleomargarine. A bill crippling the production of“adulterated” lard passed the House in 1890 but failed in the Senate because ofthe opposition of the cottonseed oil interests, who were successfully makingcomposed lard, lard mixed with cottonseed oil.More generally, Congress passed a bill in 1888 prohibiting the manufacture andsale of adulterated food and drugs in the District of Columbia, which of coursehas always been conceded to be constitutionally under federal control. But thefirst important general federal bill mandating pure food and drugs was submittedin 1890 by Senator Algernon S. Paddock of Nebraska, chairman of the SenateCommittee on Agriculture and Forestry. The Committee reported out of the bill toprotect consumers and producers against adulteration and, most significantly, toraise the reputation of American food products in export markets abroad. Thebill mandated labelling of components and outlawed adulteration, as well asprohibiting allegedly injurious ingredients. The following year, Wiley inducedPaddock to amend the bill to tighten up enforcement and place responsibility forenforcement in a food section within his own division of chemistry. In early1892, Senator Paddock delivered a speech hailing his bill as protecting thepocketbook as well as the health of consumers, and as helping the farmer bystrengthening our export markets.Lobbying for the Paddock bill were many farm organizations, including theAlliance and the Grange, state legislatures, boards of trade, and wholesalegrocery and drug associations. Opposed to it were the cottonseed oil producers,as well as the manufacturers of other new and mixed products, which would befirst in line to be attacked as an “adulteration” from the “purity” of theoriginal definition of any particular product. The bill passed the Senate butdied in the House, facing as it did a public which was either apathetic orpositively opposed to a pure food and drug act as an illegitimate andpaternalistic intervention of government into their lives.Speaking for the Paddock bill before the Franklin Institute, Dr. Wiley concededthat only a small part of food adulteration injured the consumers. He was moreworried about them spending their money in ways that he considered unwise; thepoor were purchasing food that was “ostensibly pure and nutritious, but inreality valueless.”[15] [part0015_split_001.html#fn15] His concern for theconsumer’s pocketbook, however, was conveniently forgotten when he pointed outto his colleagues in the Department of Agriculture that if adulteration wereoutlawed, the farmers’ markets would broaden, and food prices would rise. Or, toput it in starker terms, competition in food products would be crippled, supplywould therefore be reduced, and food and farm prices would rise. Which wasperhaps the point of the whole enterprise.The second Cleveland administration was a difficult time for Wiley, forSecretary of Agriculture J. Sterling Morton insisted on spending cuts andbureaucratic dismissals in the department. However, the food and drug crusadepressed on. Most states enacted pure food and drug laws during the 1890s; theinitiative came from industrial and merchant groups anxious to protectthemselves against competition. In the late 1890s, the Association of OfficialAgricultural Chemists launched reports, studies, and addresses againstadulteration. Heading the Associations’ committee on food standards, andtherefore spearheading this drive, was Dr. Harvey Wiley. By 1897, Wiley urgedthe Paddock bill as a model law for all states and got his proposed billintroduced in the House by Republican Representative Marriott Brosius ofPennsylvania. The Brosius bill outlawed adulteration, compelled the labelling offood contents, and barred poisonous ingredients. Wiley’s Division of Chemistryin the Department of Agriculture was to examine samples of food and to regulateproducts in interstate commerce.Favoring the bill were the National Grange and Farmers’ National Congress,interested in cartelizing the food industry. Particularly advocating the billwas a new overall organization designed to lobby for a pure food and drug law,the National Pure Food and Drug Congress, which was set up at a convention inMarch 1898. The Congress, consisting of 150 delegates from 24 states, was calledby a group including health officers and wholesale grocers of the District ofColumbia. The Congress was the idea of Alexander J. Wedderburn, formerpropagandist in the service of Dr. Wiley and now master of the State Grange ofVirginia. Wiley was the chairman of the Congress’s advisory committee, and laterchairman of its legislative committee, which got Brosius to revise his bill.[16][part0015_split_001.html#fn16]Wiley’s concern for “purity” was designed to put competitive innovation into astraitjacket. Thus, Wiley vigorously opposed adding blends to straight whiskeyand harshly criticized rectified whiskey because he though it “fraudulent” tocall it “whiskey,” and he felt that such an “impure” product had to be injuriousto the health.Subsequent pure food and drug bills, shepherded by Dr. Wiley, were stronglybacked by farmers’ groups, such as the National Grange, by commercialorganizations such as the National Board of Trade, the National Retail Grocers’Association, the National Wholesale Druggists’ Association, the National RetailLiquor Dealers’ Association, the Proprietary Association of America, and, lastbut not least, the American Pharmaceutical and American Medical Association.Soon, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Baking PowderAssociation, and many individual companies contributed heavy support for a purefood and drug bill, drawn up by Dr. Wiley and submitted to the House byRepresentative William P. Hepburn. Finally, under the impact of the meat packingexcitement, Wiley’s bill passed the Congress almost unanimously in 1906, withTheodore Roosevelt giving the measure at least passive support. Wileyacknowledged that the “great majority” of food manufacturers supported thebill.[17] [part0015_split_001.html#fn17]The Pure Food and Drug Act was a continuation of previous congressional billsand legislations on the state level. It prohibited “adulteration” (to be decidedby bureaucrats and the special interests they represented), which cracked downon certain forms of competition, and required “honest labeling,” which addedadditional costs on firms that did not previously do so. At the helm was Dr.Wiley and his Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture.[18][part0015_split_001.html#fn18]Wiley’s passion for pure food and drugs dovetailed neatly, after the passage ofthe law, with his equally dominant lifelong passion for sugar. After thefrustrations of the Democratic Cleveland administration, the Republican McKinleyadministration gladdened Wiley’s heart by restoring and expanding Wiley’s sugarbeet experiments. For a domestic sugar beet industry had now been made viable bythe Dingley Tariff Act of 1897, which doubled the duty on imported sugar.Wiley’s studies and subsidized experiments now greatly aided the beet sugarindustry. At the first annual convention of the American Beet Sugar Associationin 1904, Dr. Wiley was introduced with the encomium that “We have had no moreloyal and staunch friend.”Harvey W. Wiley, as befitting a Progressive, was an ardent imperialist, and hevigorously supported the American annexations of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and thePhilippines. But his devotion to American sugar took precedence over imperialconcerns, and he opposed President Roosevelt, whom he had generally supported,over T.R.’s desire to import Cuban sugar for free or at reduced duties after ithad become our virtual protectorate.If Harvey Wiley was ruthless with foreign sugar, he was even more bitterlyopposed to any competitive substitute for sugar, especially if he could alsostigmatize it as “artificial” and “impure,” in contrast to his favoritecommodity. Teddy Roosevelt soon broke with the spiritual mentor of the Pure Foodand Drug law, and the issue was the problem of saccharin. Wiley did his best tooutlaw saccharin, thereby gladdening the hearts of his friends and associates inthe sugar industry. Wiley denounced saccharin as a “deception” because itprovided a cheap substitute for sugar; since it was devoid of food value,according to Wiley, it must therefore be harmful. The solicitor and associatechemist of the Department of Agriculture, appointed by the president as a checkupon the obstreperous Wiley, pronounced saccharin harmless and should thereforebe permitted in food if labelled as such. Finally, in January 1908, T.R.appointed a higher board in the Department to pass on differences of opinionover adulterated food and thereby to overrule Wiley; as a special dig at Wiley,the board was headed by Ira Remsen, the distinguished discoverer of saccharin.It is no accident that the emotional T.R. should have broken with Wiley over thesaccharin question, for Roosevelt was accustomed to take saccharin in his dailycoffee and was therefore convinced that Wiley was hopelessly addled in hisattempt to deprive the president of his favorite sweetener.[19][part0015_split_001.html#fn19]Wiley’s biographer perceptively summed up the man whose crusading passion hadshifted from pietist Christianity to the new salvation of mankind by science or,more particularly, by scientists, professionals, and technocrats in the name ofvalue-free science. As Anderson puts it: “Science filled the void left by theloss of faith. ... Perhaps [Wiley’s] views ... stemmed from his heritage ofevangelical Christianity, a heritage whose theological superstructure had lostits meaning for him but whose burning zeal for social justice remained.”[20][part0015_split_001.html#fn20]3. THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND THE CONSERVATION CRUSADEThe conservation movement, past and present, has generally been painted insweetness and light, as disinterested nature lovers leading the “people” in waragainst corporate interests who wished to exploit and plunder natural resources.The actual facts were quite different. As Professor Samuel P. Hays, thepioneering revisionist historian of the conservation movement, has declared:> The crusading quality of the conservation movement has given it an enviable> reputation as a defender of spiritual values and national character. ... [But]> conservation neither arose from a broad popular outcry, nor centered its fire> primarily upon the private corporation. Moreover, the corporations often> supported conservation policies, while the “people” just as frequently opposed> them. In fact, it becomes clear that one must discard completely the struggle> against corporations as the setting in which to understand conservation> history ...[21] [part0015_split_001.html#fn21]As in so many other aspects of the progressive movement, conservationconstituted a shift of control or ownership of natural resources from private togovernmental hands in order to subsidize and cartelize private interests in thatarea. In the name of “scientific” management, government intervention took twoforms: either subsidize research and development in natural sources or withholdresources indefinitely from use, thereby cartelizing the resource, and raisingprices for private producers and increasing the capital value of resourcesalready in private hands. Thus, as in so much of the Progressive Era,professionals and technocrats formed a congenial alliance with privateinterests.We have already noted Theodore Roosevelt’s early interest in forest conservationand his close friendship with the man who was to become the unquestioned leaderof the forest conservation movement, Gifford Pinchot. After training in forestryin France and Germany, the wealthy young Pinchot became a consultant for privateforest owners, advocating European techniques of “scientific forestry.” In 1895,President Cleveland’s Secretary of the Interior Hoke Smith, responding togrowing pressure by Eastern nature lovers, appointed Harvard Professor CharlesS. Sargent to a National Forestry Committee, of which Pinchot was a member. Thecommittee’s report deplored the pro-use attitude of the cities of the West andurged a systematic permanent withdrawal and reserving of forest land by thefederal government. Responding to the committee, President Cleveland created21.3 million acres of forest reserves in early 1897, making 39.0 million acresof total reserves. In 1898, Gifford Pinchot became Chief of the Division ofForestry and, in 1900, head of the new Bureau of Forestry—by 1905 called theForest Service—in the Department of Agriculture. The previous head of theDivision, the German-American and German-trained Bernhard Fernow, had beenrelatively harmless, confining himself to the study of individual trees and todispensing technical information. Fernow had not been a crusader.Pinchot, however, set out the convert the nation to scientific forestry. Herapidly formed an alliance with private timber companies, proselytizing andaiding them in forestry techniques. Some of the largest timber owners in thecountry had sought his assistance, including the Kirby Lumber Company of Texas,the Northern Pacific Railroad, and the Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company in thePacific Northwest. By 1905, Pinchot had aided the owners of three million acresof timber and had helped manage almost 200,000 acres. In 1901, Pinchot and hiscolleagues in scientific forestry formed the Society of American Foresters, andin a few years they were able to convert the older group, the American ForestryAssociation, from an aesthetic admiration of forests and arbors into anorganization on behalf of the new scientific forestry. As a result of Pinchot’sefforts, private lumbermen joined the AFA, and by 1909, the Association had anadvisory board including representatives of nine lumbermen’s organizations.When Congress failed to appropriate money for a clerk in the Bureau of Forestry,the private lumbermen raised the funds for three years in a row; furthermore,they endowed a chair in forestry at Yale, assisted forestry students in fieldtraining, and formed lobbying groups in behalf of Pinchot and his Forest Bureauin Congress.As soon as Roosevelt became president, he began reserving more and more parts ofthe public domain from private homesteading and into the permanentlygovernmental national forests. In his first year as president, Roosevelt created13 new forests totaling 15.5 million acres. When in 1907, Congress, in alarm atRoosevelt’s grabbing new forest reserves, revoked his authority to create newreserves in six Western states, T.R. spitefully rushed to set aside 75 millionadditional acres of forests before the bill became law, bringing the grand totalup to 151 million acres. In late 1905, Roosevelt transferred control of thenational forests from the Department of the Interior to his friend Pinchot andthe Forest Service. Furthermore, Roosevelt and Pinchot gave the impetus to abill finally passed in 1911 as the Weeks Act, which purchased large areas ofprivate land in the East to be set aside by the Forest Service as nationalforest.How did the private timber interests stand on this policy of sequesteringforests under permanent government ownership? Roosevelt himself answered thisquestion by announcing that “The great users of timber are themselves forwardingthe movement for forest preservation.” J.H. Cox has pointed to the great supportof this Progressive forest reservation policy by the timber interests and lumbermanufacturers of the Northwest:> lumber manufacturers and timber owners ... had arrived at a harmonious> understanding with Gifford Pinchot as early as 1903. ... In other words the> government by withdrawing timber lands from entry and keeping them off the> market would aid in appreciating the value of privately owned timber.[22]> [part0015_split_001.html#fn22]The American Lumberman, official journal of the lumbering industry, as well asthe National Lumber Manufacturers’ Association, expressed similar approvalduring this period.In addition to the timber owners, the lumber users also weighed in forcompulsory conservation in the interests of preserving their future supplies.Hardwood users were particularly eager to set aside the Appalachian mountainrange as a hardwood area, and they became active in the AFA as well as backingPinchot in the Forest Service. Hardwood users who joined the advisory board ofthe AFA by 1909 included the Tight Barrel Stave Manufacturers’ Association, theNational Association of Box Manufacturers, the Carriage Builders’ NationalAssociation, and the National Slack Cooperage Manufacturers’ Association.The timber interests were, of course, all too aware that compulsory sequesteringof forest lands by the federal government would raise the prices and value oftheir timber. The alliance between industry and bureaucrats for higher priceswas nowhere more stark than in the drive for higher tariffs on foreign lumber.If conservation of domestic resources had truly been their primary aim, then the“scientific” foresters in the federal bureaucracy should have been ferventlyeager to import foreign timber in order to slow down domestic production.Instead, the foresters joined the timber industry in advocating higher tariffs.Until the 1890s, American policy had been to allow public lands, includingtimber, to pass into private ownership as soon as they were homesteaded byprivate users. The beginning of the end of homesteading came with the GeneralLand Law Revision Act of 1891, which granted the president power to createnational forest reserves by mere proclamation. This power was installed by thepolitical pressure of the American Forestry Association and the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science, aided by President Harrison.The impetus for the 1891 measure had been upper-class “preservationist,” aromantic desire to use government to preserve pristine forests and game animalsintact. But Pinchot and Roosevelt were “scientific” cartelists and were soonable to elbow the preservationists aside. In the inter-bureaucratic maneuveringthat won control for his Forest Service as against the Department of theInterior, Pinchot was able to use his powerful political allies, the Westernstockmen, who were anxious to lease the forests to graze their animals. So fondwere the stockmen of Pinchot’s policies that the American National LivestockAssociation, from 1901 onward, passed resolutions endorsing Pinchot and thetransfer of the national forests to his control. Thus Pinchot was able to keepEastern game preservationist organizations from converting the national forestsfrom all commercial use into game preserves. Roosevelt and Pinchot even turnedagainst their old colleagues in the Boone and Crockett Club and managed tosquash the Club’s proposal to reserve game areas in the national forests.Grazing under lease, indeed, soon became a far more important commercial use ofthe national forests than lumbering, thus cementing still further the alliancebetween the Roosevelt administration and the Western stockmen. This happypartnership between government as the owner and private firms as users orleasers of the land demonstrates that private firms do not necessarily opposegovernment ownership.The Western grazing range had long been a mess, the direct result of theantiquated homesteading law which had governed U.S. land policy since the CivilWar. The maximum homesteading acreage of 160 was well suited to the wetagriculture of the lands east of the Mississippi; but on the dry land of theWestern prairie, 160 acres was an absurdly small technological unit for a farm.But since the 160-acre maximum still remained in force, the result, for decades,was a vast “open range,” owned by the federal government, but used in common ona first-come, first-served basis by private users. The result of this “landcommunism” in the West was that the private users had a strong incentive to useup the soil or land as rapidly as possible, before their competitors could useit, and then to move onto the rest of the range. On the other hand, there was anegative incentive for maintaining or improving the soil, since any person orfirm who invested in the soil could not keep other users from looting theseimprovements. The result was destruction of the soil and grassland, as well as afailure to maintain or restore, let alone improve, these resources.[23][part0015_split_001.html#fn23]Many private firms favored this system, since they could operate with littlecapital and without the burden of maintaining the land. But the result was notonly destruction of the soil, but also chaos, conflict, and the “range wars”between competing users of the land familiar to fans of Western films. All thisfrom the failure of the federal government to allow private property in theWestern range.Samuel Hays writes:> Moving their livestock from the higher alpine ranges during the summer to the> lower grazing lands in the winter, cattle and sheepmen could operate> profitability with little capital and no privately owned land.

State and community boosters, favoring a growing population, sidedwith the farmers. These farm groups established state immigration commissions toencourage migrants from the East and strongly opposed any private homesteadingor fencing by cattlemen or leasing by grazers. Cattlemen tried to do the reverseand, to discourage settlement. Often, cattlemen would buy up all the waterrights in an area to deny farmers the use of water. Sheepmen were hated by thecattlemen, because sheep, guided by herders, were more mobile and could foragemore quickly. Furthermore, cattle would often refuse to graze where sheep hadpreviously been. Cattlemen managed to obtain state laws to prohibit sheepgrazing near villages or to tax sheep entering from another state.Cattlemen originally tried to amend the homestead laws to enable them tohomestead cattle ranches, but Congress refused. Then, cattlemen simply fencedportions of the open range, but Congress banned that practice in 1885. Onrailroad or state-owned lands, cattlemen were permitted to lease. And so, indefault of the private ownership option, cattlemen from the 1880s on agitatedfor Congress to lease the public range to the stockmen. For, in that, at leastland communism would be eliminated, and cattle would be assured, at least forcertain periods, of lands that they could graze exclusively.The scientific foresters and agriculturalists also favored leasing for grazing,for then, they felt, the soil and grass of the public domain could be at leastpartially restored. And in contrast to private ownership, the government and itsforest and agricultural technologists could regulate the cattle and sheep andthe use of the land. Both interests, then—that of the stockmen and of thescientific bureaucracy—would be fostered by a leasing program.Gifford Pinchot and his fellow scientific foresters waged a successful battle,from the turn of the century on, against the preservationist policy of theDepartment of the Interior during the 1890s. In 1894, the Secretary of theInterior prohibited all grazing in the national forests. But in 1897, Congresspassed the Forest Management Act, which paved the way for the InteriorDepartment to allow grazing. From then on, Pinchot was able eventually to gainthe upper hand, and grazing won out, aided by the head of Pinchot’s Division ofGrazing, a prominent Arizona sheepman and founder of the Arizona Wool Growers’Association, Albert F. Potter.Apart from the national forests, what of the rest of the public domain? Why notapply livestock grazing leasing there as well? Roosevelt and Pinchot formed analliance with the Western cattlemen who had long agitated for leasing, but theyrealized they were stirring up a political hornets’ nest. The first leasingbill, introduced into the House in 1901, was defeated by the Western settlers,whose only concession was to expand the allowed homesteading acreage to 640 inwestern Nebraska, still an absurdly small acreage for cattle ranches.T.R. set up a Public Lands Commission in 1903–04, that, predictably, reported infavor of grazing leases on the public domain. But T.R. moved slowly, waitinguntil after his re-election in 1904, and finally introduced a leasing bill in1907, aided by James R. Garfield, who had become Secretary of the Interior inMarch. The House defeated the bill, however, and Congress continued to defeatPinchot’s efforts for the next decade, until he finally abandoned hope.The accession of James Garfield to the Secretary of the Interior’s office was abureaucratic triumph for Gifford Pinchot. The previous Secretary, Ethan A.Hitchcock, was a preservationist; now this son of former president Garfield, acartelizing ally of T.R.’s in the new Bureau of Corporations, was to be a firmPinchot ally in the new concept of “scientific” conservation.Theodore Roosevelt’s setting aside of 75 million acres for forest reserves inearly 1907, in defiance of Congressional will, particularly angered the bulk ofthe West anxious to use the sequestered land. There was particularly bitterhatred against Gifford Pinchot, the originator and inspirer of T.R.’s forestpolicy and, since 1905, in total control of the national forests. In response,the governor of Colorado called a Public Lands Convention of Westerners toprotest against “Pinchotism.”In reaction against this growth of opposition, T.R., once again at thesuggestion of Pinchot, whipped up a nationwide “Conservation Movement” as asupposedly grassroots crusade. The movement was proposed at the convention ofthe Deep Waterways Association in the fall of 1907 and officially launched atthe Conference of Governors held at the White House in May 1908. Rooseveltmanaged to line up in support of the conservation crusade not only many membersof his Cabinet and of the Supreme Court, but also 38 state governors, WilliamJennings Bryan, soon to be the Democratic presidential standard-bearer for thethird time. intellectuals and magazine editors, and such industrialists asAndrew Carnegie and railroad magnate James J. Hill.Such was the propaganda barrage of this Roosevelt-created movement that not onlythe Republican platform, but also the Democrats, in 1908 endorsed the new fad.Most of the enthusiasts for forest conservation in the West were, of course,urban Easterners, many of them dilettantes and statist reformers in other areas.Such prominent and wealthy Chicago urban reformers as Alfred N. Baker and WalterL. Fisher now joined enthusiastically in the conservation movement.[26][part0015_split_001.html#fn26] Such women’s groups as the General Federation ofWomen’s Clubs and especially the Daughters of the American Revolution now becameparticularly enthusiastic about conservation, the DAR maintaining a specialCommittee on Conservation, headed by Pinchot’s mother, Mrs. James Pinchot.Pinchot himself fawned on the DAR as spelling “only another name for the highestform of conservation, that of vital force and intellectual energy.”[27][part0015_split_001.html#fn27]These reformers disliked the big cities growing up around them, seeminglyreplacing the values of pietist religion, sobriety, and thrift with secularism,immorality, and profligacy. Conservation, on the other hand, seemed to promisepreservation of the beauties of nature and the maintenance of rural values. Manyof the wealthy conservation crusaders prided themselves on having abandoned“materialism” on behalf of such higher, nonmaterial ideals as parks and forests.A women’s representative declared at a meeting of the National ConservationCongress that “We feel that it is for us, who are not wholly absorbed inbusiness, to preserve ideals that are higher than business ...” And oneenthusiast exulted that “National Parks represent opportunities for worshipthrough which one comes to understand more fully certain of the attributes ofnature and its Creator.”[28] [part0015_split_001.html#fn28]We have seen, however, that many groups concerned with business also supportedthe conservation crusade, notably the private timber interests and the Westerncattlemen. Thus, Leonard Bronson, manager of the National Lumber ManufacturersAssociation, was quite frank about the reason that the lumber industry favoredforest reserves. As he wrote to the progressive Republican Senator Albert J.Beveridge of Indiana: “from a selfish standpoint alone the heavy timber ownersof the West are heartily in favor of the reserves; for the mere establishment ofthese reserves has increased the value of their holdings very heavily bywithdrawing from the market timber which otherwise would be competitive.”[29][part0015_split_001.html#fn29] And then there were the railroads. Recall thatthe land-grant railroads had received vast subsidies of land from thegovernment: not only rights-of-way for their roads, but 15-mile tracts on eitherside of the line. Government reservation of public lands greatly raised theprice received by the railroads when they later sold this land to newinhabitants of the area. The railroads were not ignorant of the monopolisticadvantages that would be conferred upon them by conservation laws; in fact, therailroads were the financial “angel” of the entire conservation movement. JamesJ. Hill, as we have seen, was an ardent conservationist. The Western railroads,it turns out, paid $45,000 annually in secret subsidy to a leadingconservationist magazine, Maxwell’s Talisman, and financed the Washingtonconservation lobby. Clearly, one reason was that subsidized irrigation,Maxwell’s major concern, would stimulate farm settlement and transportation. Butanother was, as shown above, that if the federal government reserved its publicdomain or forests from use, settlers would be forced instead on railroad grantland, and the value of their lands, as well as the traffic on their railroads,would increase. Thus, the National Irrigation Congress, the most vigorousadvocate of the Roosevelt conservation program—particularly federal irrigationsubsidies—was financed by the transcontinental and the Burlington and RockIsland railroads, to the tune of $39,000 out of their annual budget of $50,000.The railroads were led, in this subsidy, by James J. Hill.[30][part0015_split_001.html#fn30]Subsidized irrigation was a frankly developmental part of the new “conservation”program. The program had begun in 1888, when Congress authorized the first waterresources investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey. Young engineer FrederickHaynes Newell organized this work and continued it as chief hydrographer; Newellalso served as secretary of the National Geographic Society during the 1890s.From the beginning, private corporations, interested in developing water andirrigation, enthusiastically encouraged the socialization of their researchcosts through the Geological Survey and lobbied for ever-larger congressionalappropriations.Private irrigation in the West proved to be a bust in the Depression of 1893,after which the private irrigators turned to the federal government to financethese uneconomic ventures for them. The Carey Act of 1894, sponsored by SenatorRobert Carey (R., Wyo.), granted a million acres of federal land to each Westernstate to allow the states to finance irrigation. But this, too, was not enough,so in the late 1890s, Newell and other federal officials joined with privateWestern interests to demand outright federal financing.The propaganda campaign for federal financing was led by a young northernCalifornia lawyer, George H. Maxwell, who was inspired by a quixotic vision ofdepopulating urban centers and settling urban types on the land. The crusaderMaxwell first converted the National Irrigation Congress, in 1896, to the ideaof federal financing, a conversion which must not have been very difficult. Hethen converted private business groups by arguing that federal irrigation wouldincrease Western farm population and broaden Western markets for Easternbusiness. Probably even more influential was the opportunity of subsidy to allforms of agri-business. In their annual conventions in 1898, the National Boardof Trade, the National Business Men’s League, and the National Association ofManufacturers all endorsed federal aid to irrigation and continued to do sothereafter. The following year, the indefatigable Maxwell organized his ownNational Irrigation Association to lobby for the cause; the NIA published hisown monthly Maxwell’s Talisman. By 1900, the propaganda coalition had done itswork so well that both major parties adopted federal irrigation plans in theirplatforms.The major booster of federal irrigation in Congress was a Representative FrancisG. Newlands (D., Nev.), a wealthy silver mine owner. After the bimetallic causelost out, Newlands shifted to emphasize irrigation, pushing a Reclamation Actthrough Congress in 1902. The Reclamation Act provided a new device to financefederal irrigation projects in the West: all receipts from the sale of publicland in the West go to a special fund for irrigation works in those states. TheReclamation Act also delighted conservationists by giving maximal power tofinance projects to the Secretary of the Interior so that he would not have tobe restricted by the necessity of getting annual appropriations from thepeople’s representatives in Congress. In this way, scientific expertise wouldreplace taxpayer and democratic control.Eastern Republicans were understandably critical of the reclamation bill forsubsidizing Western farmers at the expense of Eastern competition; but the Westwas able to spring a tu quoque by attacking the Rivers and Harbors bills thathad long subsidized Eastern lands. But the main force behind the passage of theReclamation Act was Theodore Roosevelt, who had enthusiastically backed federalirrigation in the 1900 campaign, and had long been personally influenced by bothPinchot and Newell. In his first message to Congress, the new president askedfor the advice of these two men, and he then drove through the Reclamation Act.It was not surprising that T.R. appointed Frederick Newell to be head of the newReclamation Service, which later became a Bureau directly under the Secretary ofthe Interior in 1907.Federal irrigation of course boosted the prices of the subsidized land. Much ofthe land was owned by speculators, who had either homesteaded the landoriginally or purchased it from homesteaders, and these speculators were mainlymen of moderate means. The higher land prices, which both government irrigatorsand large corporate developers were now obliged to pay, irritated these powerfulgroups. The private ditch and reservoir companies found, too, that thespeculator-settlers were not interested in immediate development and thereforehad no interest in the purchase of their water. For their poor forecasting ofdemand, the private irrigation companies often went bankrupt. To try to shore upthe companies, the Carey Act of 1894 provided that any settlers who bought landin the new irrigation projects would be forced to purchase water rights from theprivate company that had constructed the irrigation works. Carey himself hadexperienced financial difficulties in previous irrigation schemes, which he hadpromoted, and tried to eliminate them in the future by this tie-in plan. TheReclamation Act of 1902 extended this compulsory tie-in of land and water rightsfrom state to federal projects. Not only that: in the same act, the federalgovernment took up the entire burden by retaining title to all irrigationreservoirs and large ditches and agreeing to maintain and operate them forever.Bankruptcy of uneconomic private irrigation projects would no longer be astumbling-block to excessive and hasty development through subsidizedirrigation; for now, the federal government and the taxpayer would take on thetask.But the comforting umbrella of the Reclamation Service applied only to ditch,reservoir, and farming sites after it had approved a certain project. Thecompulsory tie-in provisions did not apply if settlers already owned the sites.And speculator-settlers had usually been alerted by many years of boosterism andagitation for the particular project. The next step, then, was accomplished inthe Reclamation Act: for both government and corporate developers to pressurethe Congress to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw all landfrom homesteading that might be capable of being irrigated. Under the pressureof Frederick H. Newell, Chief of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Secretary agreedto withdraw any lands from possible private use as long as the Bureau felt itmight irrigate them at some time in the future. Here was an important example oflarge private land developers joining enthusiastically with bureaucrats andtechnocrats in urging the federal government to keep land off the market and outof the hands of homesteaders and settlers. Moreover, they agitated for therepeal of the Desert Land Act of 1877, under which a private settler couldhomestead 320 acres of federal desert land if he irrigated the land himself.This sort of private competition was scarcely welcome to the large corporateirrigators who yearned for a federal-state irrigation partnership.The West generally favored rapid private settlement and development through thebroadest possible homesteading of the public lands. They strongly opposed anysuch reservation of the public domain as was pushed by Roosevelt’s forestconservation or Reclamation Bureau irrigation policy. And yet so greedy was theWest for public subsidy that they were willing to swallow the reservationclauses in order to pass the Reclamation Act of 1902. In pushing through thebill, Teddy Roosevelt spoke grandly of helping the noble homesteader, whoseinterests he was quick to suppress in his forest and irrigation reservationprograms. The West was so lured by subsidy and the rhetoric of homesteading thatit supported the bill.So the Reclamation Act was passed by a coalition of subsidized Westerners,technocrats, and Eastern businessmen and manufacturers sensing increased Westernmarkets for their products. Understandably bitterly opposed were the Midwesternfarmers, who saw the competition of Western farmers subsidized by themselvesalong with other taxpayers. The Midwestern Democracy took the lead in theopposition. One of the most trenchant attacks was levelled by RepresentativeJohn S. Snook (D., Oh.), who pointed out that the pioneer-farmer in the Midwesthad accomplished his survival and prosperity by his own efforts:> He accomplished all this by his own efforts. ... He overcame all these> difficulties unaided and alone. He never received, yea, more than that, he> never asked, for a cent of government aid. And now you propose to tax him and> the fruits of his unaided toil to build up a great farming section where> products will be raised to compete with those he raises ...[31]> [part0015_split_001.html#fn31]As is typical of men who wish to force others to sacrifice in their own behalf,the Western leaders accused the Midwesterners of following their “narrow andselfish local and personal interest.” The advocates of irrigation subsidies, incontrast, were men of “Americanism” and of “broad-minded statesmanship.”[32][part0015_split_001.html#fn32] To which Representative William P. Hepburn (R.,Iowa) made the proper reply:> If I were not one of the most amiable and polite men in this House, I would> take the liberty of saying that the proposition involved in this bill is the> most insolent and impudent attempt at larceny that I have ever seen embodied> in a legislative proposition. These gentlemen simply do what? They ask us ...> to give away an empire in order that their private property may be made> valuable.With the Reclamation Act safely passed, the technocrat-largedeveloper-transcontinental railroad coalition lobbied vigorously during theRoosevelt administration for the repeal of the Desert Land Act, repeal of theTimber and Stone Act of 1878, which permitted homesteading of public landvaluable for timber and stone, and generally to constrict private homesteadingin the West to the technologically absurd maximum of 160 acres. Accordingly, onOctober 22, 1903, President Roosevelt appointed a three-man Public LandsCommission, consisting of Pinchot, Newell, and chairman William A. Richards,former governor of Wyoming and now Commissioner of the General Land Office inthe Department of Interior. The following year, the Commission’s report dulypushed for the conservationist program, including: greater reservation of publicland from private use, the repeal of the Timber and Stone Act, and the reductionof the Desert Land Act entries to 160 acres.The Public Lands Commission report quickly met with the hearty approval of thepresident of the National Board of Trade, the National Association ofManufacturers, the National Business League of America, and the NationalIrrigation Association.[33] [part0015_split_001.html#fn33] George Maxwellmobilized his entire propaganda machine, including the transcontinentalrailroads and manufacturing organizations, behind the commission report.Despite this formidable pressure and the repeated pleas of the president,Congress, led by the citizens of the West themselves, blocked passage of thecommission’s measures. In particular, they saw that repression of homesteading,especially through the reservation of lands and forests, would crippledevelopment of the West. As E. Louise Peffer writes about the Roosevelt period:> It appears ironical that, in a period of such heart-felt sympathy for the> homesteader and concern over preserving for his benefit all the remaining good> land, every effort seemed to be aimed at cutting down his opportunities.

To> succeed on such undesirable land, the entryman had to have double or more the> acreage allowed by the Homestead Law.[34] [part0015_split_001.html#fn34]Superficially, it may seem inconsistent for Roosevelt and his conservationprogram to stress reservation and withdrawal on some occasions, and subsidizeddevelopment on others. But there is a deeper consistency to all parts of theprogram. In every case, land and natural resources are taken out of free,private settlement and development and converted to State regulation andcontrol, in partnership with a relatively few privileged private interests.Where government takes resources off the market, the aim is to restrict andcartelize lands or resource industries. Where government subsidizes development,it is carefully limited to a partnership with selected private interests insteadof left open to the competition of the free market. Statism—corporatestatism—was the key. Thus, the members and colleagues of the Public LandsCommission continued to meet informally after its formal existence was over,and, as Hays writes, a common theme underlay their efforts: “The old practice ofdisposing of nonagricultural lands to private owners, Pinchot and others argued,must give way to public ownership and public management.”[35][part0015_split_001.html#fn35]The consistency of the conservation program was greatly aided by the fact thatthe various wings of conservationists generally worked in tandem. As we haveindicated, forest reservationists and irrigationists assiduously promoted eachother’s cause. This collaboration was greatly aided by the forest cover-floodcontrol mythology that had been adopted by the conservationists. The familiarargument ran that forests were essential in absorbing rainfall, retarding streamrunoff, checking soil erosion, and therefore preventing floods and preservinguniformity of the water supply. Irrigationists, private power and water supplycorporations, municipal water departments, and forest and worker scientistsjoined in this seemingly powerful and “scientific” argument for forestreservation. The alliance began as early as the Harrison administration in theearly 1890s, when the president was prevailed upon by southern Californiagroups, panicky over forest cover flood and soil erosion, to create the SanBernardino National Forest. The major lobbyist for this National Forest wasGeneral Adolph Wood, president of the Arrowhead Reservoir Company, a privatecorporation engaged in storing water for power, irrigation, and general domesticuse. Wood was understandably interested in turning to state and federalgovernment to subsidize the long-run supply of his water.[36][part0015_split_001.html#fn36]By the latter years of the Roosevelt administration, the T.R. conservationistshad expanded the irrigation program and the irrigation-forestry alliance into acomprehensive statist program for federal “multiple-purpose river development.”The multiple-purpose concept grew also out of a dozen years of enthusiasm forgovernmental subsidies to river navigation. The river development movement arosethroughout the country in the late 1890s, led invariably by urban merchants andmanufacturers, anxious to force the general taxpayer to subsidize rivertransport. One problem is that shippers, after 1898, faced a continuing rise inrailroad freight rates, reversing the trend of previous decades. Part of acounter-drive was to lobby government to promote inland navigation for a cheaperform of transportation—cheaper for themselves, of course, not for the taxpayers.Local merchants and manufacturers easily persuaded local and regional boostergroups that federal funds in their area would promote that area as againstcompeting towns and regions.For many years, the enthusiasts for the expensive “new waterway” boondoggleswere thwarted by Congress, led by the shrewd representative Theodore E. Burton(R., Ohio), chairman of the House Rivers and Harbors Committee. Burton, alawyer, banker, and water transportation expert, argued that the proposed riverimprovements and inland canals were far too expensive and would have littleeffect on railway rates. In frustration, the waterway agitators formed theNational Rivers and Harbors Congress in 1901, regrouping five years later tobecome the most powerful lobby for the waterway movement. It urged a $50 millionannual federal river development program and, at its December 1908 meeting,endorsed a vast $500 million federal bond issue for waterway development, aswell as a permanent commission whose task would be to propose new projects.In 1907, Roosevelt’s conservationist leaders gathered all these conservationistthreads together to formulate the concept of multiple-purpose river basindevelopment. Forests would be reserved for their own sake and also to regulatestream flow of water, reservoirs would be built to control floods, promoteirrigation, and generate hydroelectric power, and rivers would be developed fornavigation and all these other functions. The vast expense involved meantfederal funds and federal control; not only had local and private funding provedinadequate for the irrigation desired by the new planners, but rivers, afterall, run interstate, and therefore, if they are to be planned by government,require federal operation and control. Newell, Pinchot, and Garfield werecrucial to formulating and pushing for the new concept. So too was W.J. McGee,the chief theoretician and organizer of the new multiple-purpose river basinmovement. A self-taught geologist and anthropologist from Iowa, and at thispoint assistant head of the Bureau of Ethnology in the Roosevelt administration,McGee worked tirelessly to persuade all branches of the conservation movement ofthe new dispensation. Daily he peppered Roosevelt, Pinchot, and Garfield withideas and suggestions; he drew up presidential messages and organizedconferences. McGee pushed Newell into expanding irrigation projects to theireffects on river flows, and he urged Newell on the new National Rivers andHarbors Congress.In February 1907, McGee urged upon T.R. the creation of a federal InlandWaterways Commission. Roosevelt accepted the idea the following month, includingon the Commission, appointing Pinchot and Newell to it and giving McGee thecritical post of Commission Secretary. From that point on, multiple-purposeriver development became a leading conservation policy of President Roosevelt. Acrucial figure aiding the commission was Marshall O. Leighton, ChiefHydrographer for the U.S. Geological Survey, who had worked on flood controlproblems. As advisory hydrographer to the Inland Waterways Commission, Leightondrew up the practical engineering plans for a mammoth development scheme for theOhio River System, consisting of no less than one hundred reservoirs for floodcontrol, from which the federal government would produce and sell the power forthe alleged self-financing of the project.In December 1907 Senator Francis Newlands presented a bill incorporating thefindings of the Commission, establishing the Inland Waterways Commission as apermanent body with the power not only to investigate, but also to decide uponwater projects, with Congress providing a permanently available fund of $50million for their financing. That is, the president could replenish the fundwhen it fell sharply below the $50 million level.Despite the enthusiastic support of Roosevelt, this leap into statism wassuccessfully blocked by the opposition of Representative Burton and the ArmyCorps of Engineers, who wished to confine water projects to navigation aid only,and who stoutly denied the theory that forest cover retarded the runoff ofwater. While the comprehensive multiple-purpose concept failed, it proved aharbinger of the future. As Hays puts it: “Although Congress approved few of itsproposals, the Roosevelt administration for the first time worked out thegeneral principles and specific elements of the multiple-purpose approach toriver development which the New Deal put into practice over two decadeslater.”[37] [part0015_split_001.html#fn37]As we have pointed out, the forest stream-flow theory was critical to theallegedly scientific basis for the technocratic enthusiasm for integratedmulti-purpose development. Unfortunately, the scientific basis of thiswell-known theory was shaky at best. Oddly enough, for alleged scientists, theirenthusiasm for the theory waxed not in proportion to the evidence behind it, butto the political popularity of forest conservation and multiple-purposedevelopment. Though tentative at first, confidence of the conservationists inthe theory swelled after the conservationist victories from 1902 on, reaching apeak in the struggles over the Inland Waterways Commission proposals six yearslater.From the counterattack by the Army Corps of Engineers came scientific argumentswhich punctured the new forest cover myth. Lieutenant Colonel Hiram MartinChittenden, a veteran of river control, delivered an influential paper beforethe American Society of Civil Engineers in September 1908 which set up adevastating barrage against the myth. Chittenden pointed out that there was noquantitative evidence of any impact of deforestation on river flow. Furthermore,the existence of forests can cut both ways, for forest litter accumulates waterand thereby adds to floods. As for soil erosion, wrote Chittenden, it is causedby poor agricultural practices rather than deforestation. Other Corps engineersdid quantitative studies that showed no correlation between forested ordeforested conditions on particular rivers with the incidence of floods. WillisMoore, head of the U.S. Weather Bureau, argued also that floods are caused byexcessive precipitation period, and that water runoff is not materially affectedby any other factor; “high waters are not higher and the low waters are notlower than formerly,” i.e., than before deforestation.The devastating attacks of Chittenden and Moore began the inexorable decline, atleast in scientific circles, of the forest cover stream-flow theory.Professor Gordon Dodds sums up his illuminating discussion of the stream-flowcontroversy as follows:> The stream-flow controversy not only illustrates the emotionalism of the> conservation movement and its misrepresentations of science but also reveals> much about the contemporary concepts of science itself. ...

See Whitney, Antitrust Policies, p. 35. [Editor’sremarks] Consumer protection, such as food regulation, was one of the mainplanks of Roosevelt’s famous “Square Deal,” the others being corporateregulation and conservation of natural resources. In his two terms as president,Roosevelt made great advances toward these cartelizing goals and laterchampioned a “New Nationalism” that advocated similar progressive measures.Although there were differences in emphasis, Woodrow Wilson’s “New Freedom” wasa similar program that stressed tax reform, federal regulation of business, andmonetary reform.

Rothbard planned to elaborate on the cartelization of the drug industryand the medical profession further, but unfortunately did not do so. The drugindustry and medical profession were believed to be vastly unsafe untilgovernment regulation, with unsuspecting consumers buying addicting anddangerous medicines and medical treatments from quack salesmen and heterodoxdoctors. While sensational for the media, addiction and death were overblownand, in fact, partially caused by prior regulations. In addition, the mainstreammedical profession also practiced treatments that would be considered dangerousand ineffective by today’s standards. In 1910, the Flexner Report, written byAbraham Flexner, brother of Simon Flexner, head of the Rockefeller Institute forMedical Research, proposed a licensing system for medical schools and hospitalsthat artificially raised quality and blocked out many black, female, and Jewishdoctors as well as proprietary hospitals and alternative forms of medicine.

Or rather, a quadripartite coalition, since economists and otherintellectuals were needed to argue for and help plan the new system. Howfitting, then, that the major big business-led organization for the newdispensation should itself include all four of these groups![1][part0016.html#fn1]1. THE ORIGINS: THE CHICAGO CIVIC FEDERATIONThe National Civic Federation (NCF), the major organization for the new statism,was organized in 1900 by Ralph M. Easley, a former schoolteacher and journalist,and a self-styled conservative Republican. The NCF emerged out of the ChicagoCivic Federation (CCF), which itself was launched in a blend of pietist reform,corporate statism, and high-level foreign influence.The CCF began as the result of frenetic denunciations of vice, gambling, andprostitution in Chicago by the pietistic Englishman William T. Stead, editor ofthe distinguished London magazine Review of Reviews. The culmination of Stead’sagitation over sin in Chicago came at a mass meeting in the city’s Civic CenterClub in November 1893, at which Stead hoped to establish a Chicago form of his“Civic Church,” a London group Stead had helped to organize. The Novembermeeting selected an organizing committee, which in turn incorporated the CivicFederation of Chicago in early 1894. President of the new CCF was Lyman J. Gage,head of the First National Bank of Chicago, a man strongly in the Rockefellerambit who was later to become Secretary of the Treasury in the McKinleyadministration. Secretary of the CCF and operating head was Ralph Easley. Amajority of posts in the new CCF was held by a group of wealthy Chicagobusinessmen.[2] [part0016.html#fn2]Stead, the spiritual founder of the CCF, was a powerful figure in England as areligious reformer and editor, and even more so behind-the-scenes. A socialreformer and ardent English imperialist, Stead was a disciple of the English artcritic and social philosopher John Ruskin and was instrumental in bringingRuskin’s young Oxford as well as Cambridge disciples together with an olderRuskinian, Cecil Rhodes. In early 1891, Rhodes and Stead had formed a secretsociety to spread the cause of social imperialism, the “Society of the Elect.”Rhodes was the leader, and Stead was on the executive committee, along withAlfred (later Lord) Milner. Other devotees of the circle included future PrimeMinister Arthur (Lord) Balfour and the powerful investment banker, LordRothschild.[3] [part0016.html#fn3]The new CCF lost little time in plunging into political activity in Chicago. Itpioneered in upper-class municipal “reform” efforts, which would later become soprominent during the Progressive Era. It drafted and pushed through expansion ofcivil service in Illinois. Various academics worked with the wealthy businessmenin the CCF, including Albion W. Small, University of Chicago sociologyprofessor, and particularly Chicago political economy professor Edward W. Bemis,member of the five-man nominating committee of the Federation. Both Small andBemis had been students of the formidable progressive economist Richard T. Ely,and both followed Ely enthusiastically into statism.Very quickly, the well-organized CCF branched out into national affairs, holdingfour national conferences, one on American foreign policy in 1898. The mostpublicized and important conference held by the CCF—which led directly to theformation of the National Civic Federation—was the Chicago Conference on Trusts,held in 1899. Ralph Easley traveled across the nation mobilizing delegates andsupport for the conference. Indeed, the Conference took on semi-official status,since some governors, including Theodore Roosevelt in New York, were induced tosend delegations to the Chicago Conference.Most speeches at the Conference, spearheaded by progressive economists JeremiahW. Jenks, Edward Bemis, and John R. Commons, asserted that the trust was here tostay and trusts needed to be regulated by government. Even the supposedlyradical Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, while more aggressivelyanti-business in rhetoric, ended by advocating a very similar program. TheConference also touched off the compulsory publicity agitation which marked theearly days of the corporate reform movement.So successful was the Chicago Conference on Trusts that the leadership of theCCF determined, by unanimous vote of the executive committee in September, 1899,to organize a national civic federation with Easley at the head, a taskaccomplished the following year. The more progressive and corporatist leadersthen joined the new NCF while the more conservative, local-minded memberscontinued to run the CCF.2. ORGANIZING THE NCFHelping Easley organize the ambitious new NCF was Jeremiah W. Jenks, Oscar S.Straus of the New York department store family and later to become Secretary ofCommerce and Labor under Theodore Roosevelt, and Samuel Gompers and JohnMitchell of the AFL (the American Federation of Labor). Also on the AdvisoryCouncil of the new federation were Richard T. Ely, Bemis, Commons, the ColumbiaUniversity economist E.R.A. Seligman of the powerful international bankingfamily, and the intriguing Albert Shaw.Shaw, a political scientist and a disciple of Ely, was later to be a leadingadvisor of Theodore Roosevelt, and he had spoken before the Chicago Conferenceon Trusts. As a leading magazine editor of The American Review of Reviews, Shawlent the power of the press to the corporatist cause. When John D. Rockefellercame to launch his General Education Board, Albert Shaw became one of thetrustees of the powerful new foundation. An interesting point about Shaw is thathe became the long-time editor of the journal in 1891 when it was set up byWilliam T. Stead, editor of the London Review of Reviews.Easley’s success was marked and rapid, and very quickly official leadership ofthe new NCF was assumed by top Rockefeller ally Marcus A. Hanna as firstpresident of the NCF, by Chicago utilities tycoon Samuel Insull, Chicago bankerFranklin MacVeagh (later Secretary of the Treasury), Andrew Carnegie,and—inevitably—several partners of J.P. Morgan and Company. By 1903, theNational Civic Federation included representatives of nearly one-third of allthe 367 corporations worth more than $10 million, and it also includedone-fourth of the largest railroads. George W. Perkins, Morgan’s main man in thepolitical sphere, was prominent in the organization. August Belmont Jr.,prominent Democrat and Rothschild agent in the U.S., was elected president ofthe NCF on Hanna’s death. At various times, the executive committee of the NCFalso included such prominent politicians as ex-President Grover Cleveland,Roosevelt’s Attorney-General Charles J. Bonaparte, T.R.’s close friend NicholasMurray Butler of Columbia University, T.R.’s Secretary of State Elihu Root,George B. Cortelyou, Roosevelt’s private secretary, later his Secretary of theTreasury, and finally president of Consolidated Gas, and Secretary of War underT.R. and then President William Howard Taft. It is clear, in short, that the NCFrepresented a coalition of top big business interests with the Morgans the mostprominent, but with Rothschilds and Rockefellers also included.[4][part0016.html#fn4]3. THE CLASH OVER UNIONSThe union problem was a particularly sticky one for the NCF, for two majorreasons: many businessmen were stubbornly laissez-faire and particularly wereopposed to unionism, and unions scarcely existed, except in such non-competitive(between localities) industries as the building trades, the cartelizedrailroads, and in certain skilled crafts where unions could exclude competinglabor. Overall, unions did not rise above a meagre 6% of the labor force untilAmerica’s entry into World War I, and they were usually well below that figure.But those unions that did exist were perfectly suited for the corporatist ideal:monopolistic craft unions grouped in the AFL unions which had abandoned theearly radical socialism of the Knights of Labor, and were prepared to take theirplace in a corporatist order—a role that would be far greater than any theycould possibly achieve in a free market.And so, labor leaders played a prominent role in the National Civic Federationfrom the very beginning. Samuel Gompers, longtime head of the AFL, was firstvice president of the NCF from its inception until his death in 1924. JohnMitchell, head of the United Mine Workers, was chairman or co-chairman of theTrade Agreements Department of the NCF from 1904 to 1911. The heads of therailroad Brotherhoods, powerful craft unions in the railroad industry, were onthe NCF executive committee.The Trade Agreements Department was organized in 1904 to promote unionism amongemployer groups. It was jointly chaired for four years by Mitchell and aprominent employer, Francis L. Robbins of the Pittsburg Coal Company. TheDepartment engineered union agreements with the New York clothing trades, theiron molders, the newspaper publishers and the Typographical Union, betweenTheatrical Managers and the Musicians Protective Association, the New York MetalTrades Association and the Boilermakers Union, bituminous coal operators and thestruggling United Mine Workers, and U.S. Steel and the Metal Workers Union.Many of the progressive big businessmen, however, while eager to foistcorporatist unionism on the rest of the country, balked at dealing with unionsin their own plants. Leading the parade favoring unions for everyone butthemselves were men prominent in the Morgan ambit: George W. Perkins, CyrusMcCormick of International Harvester, and Judge Elbert Gary of U.S. Steel.Typical was the fact that August Belmont Jr. was boosted vigorously as successorto Hanna as president of the NCF by the union leaders in the organization.Despite these cordial relations, Belmont refused to have anything to do withunions in his own Interborough Rapid Transit Company on the New York Citysubways.Opposing the big-business-dominated NCF was the newly organized NationalAssociation of Manufacturers. Formed in 1895 as a small, low-profile group topromote foreign trade, the NAM was taken over in 1902 by an aggressive group ofsmall businessmen in the Middle West, dedicated to free markets and hostility tolabor unions. Revealingly, Easley condemned the NAM and like-minded capitalistsas “anarchists”; he saw the NCF as a third way between radical socialism on theone hand and “anarchist,” free-market capitalism on the other. As Easley wroteto a supporter, “our enemies are the Socialists among the labor people and theanarchists among the capitalists.”[5] [part0016.html#fn5]For their part, the NAM leaders angrily saw the National Civic Federation as“part and parcel” of the AFL and as a proponent of “the most virulent form ofsocialism, closed shop unionism.” They also attacked the threat they saw in“socialized industry,” and they perceptively saw the NCF, as a later historianwould sum it up, “as a conspiracy between the magnates and the unionists aimeddirectly at them.” As Professor Wiebe puts it, the threat of “big labor and bigbusiness combined horrified members of the NAM, who believed their futuredepended upon an economic fluidity which the recently formed trusts and the AFLwould destroy.”[6] [part0016.html#fn6] Meanwhile, Ralph Easley was sneering atthe NAM anti-union employers as small fry; they included “none of the greatemployers of labor representing basic industries, such as coal, iron and steel,building trades and railroads.”[7] [part0016.html#fn7]The conflict between the two groups was dramatized by the anti-union actiontaken by one of the leaders of the newly-constituted National Association ofManufacturers, James W. Van Cleave, head of the Buck’s Stove and Range Companyof St. Louis. The Metal Polishers Union had struck the Buck’s Company for unionrecognition, and the AFL, in 1908, had organized a secondary boycott of theBuck’s Company in support of the strike. Van Cleve responded by filing suit totry and obtain an injunction against the boycott. At that point, Wall Streetlawyer Alton B. Parker, Democratic presidential candidate in 1904 and laterpresident of the NCF, became the defense counsel for Gompers, while much of theAFL defense was secretly financed by Andrew Carnegie, steel magnate in theMorgan ambit, who was also the NCF’s biggest contributor.[8] [part0016.html#fn8]4. THE DRIVE FOR WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION LAWSIf the pro-union attitude of the NCF offended anti-union employers, the CivicFederation’s increasing attention to promoting welfare and the welfare stateafter 1905 avoided such alienation. The Welfare Department of the NCF wasfounded in 1904 and took on an accelerating role by the following year. By 1911it had 500 employer-members. Its task was to promote a voluntary paternalisticwelfare program by the corporations toward their workers, promoting a sense ofteam spirit and a kind of feudalistic loyalty by the workers to the corporation.As Weinstein puts it, the approach of the Welfare Department “was to promotesympathy and a sense of identification between the employer and his employees byintegrating the lives and the leisure time of the workers with the functioningof the corporation.”[9] [part0016.html#fn9]More important was the National Civic Federation’s push for welfare statemeasures. Particularly important was its leadership driving for workmen’scompensation laws. Under the sensible and cogent doctrine of the common law,employers were not liable for accidents to workers if: (a) other workers wereresponsible for the accident (the fellow-servant defense), (b) if the workerknew the risk and therefore could be held to have voluntarily assumed it (theassumption-of-risk defense), or (c) if the worker himself contributed to theaccident by his negligence (the contributory negligence defense). In thisperiod, labor unions did not favor workmen’s compensation laws; rather, theycalled for changing liability laws to make the employer liable when the workerhimself did not contribute to the accident. By 1907, agitation had managed topass such “employer liability” laws in 26 states. Most of these laws appliedonly to railroads, however, where unions were strongest, and limited only thefellow-servant, the weakest of the three employer defenses.Progressive employers, in contrast, began moving in this period toward workmen’scompensation laws. From their point of view, these laws would confer severalimportant benefits. First, they would forestall the threat of employer liabilitylaws; the payments would be far less, and the costs would be spread among allthe employers, not only those with the highest rates of accidents. Second, andmore important, the taxpayers would be forced to pay a large proportion of thecosts of compensation. In contrast, say, to voluntary insurance, the taxpayingpublic would be forced to pay for the bureaucracy of the regulatory commissionsand to socialize the costs of accident insurance under state insurance plans.Third, the laws would impose high fixed costs for compliance and for accidentprevention, which would fall with particular severity on smaller competitors.Hence, workmen’s compensation laws, in the name of humanitarianism and progress,would advance the cartelization of industry. Specifically in line withcartelization, such large firms, which had already instituted voluntaryworkmen’s compensation plans such as International Harvester and U.S. Steel,could now impose higher costs on their competitors by agitating for thegovernment legislation. And fourth, for anti-union employers, workmen’scompensation would reduce benefits workers might expect from unions and leadthem to look elsewhere.Thus, at the annual 1911 meeting of the National Civic Federation, AugustBelmont Jr. announced that he had induced half a dozen major corporations, fromEdison Electric and Otis Elevator to Ingersoll-Rand to come out for workmen’scompensation laws. Andrew Carnegie also endorsed the idea. The NCF frankly saw amajor reason as the forestalling of any application of employer liability lawsto manufacturing. In the meanwhile, the always far-sighted George W. Perkinsstressed workmen’s compensation as part of a broad reach toward industrialcartelization. As Perkins explained at the 1909 annual meeting of the NCF,“Cooperation in business is taking and should take the place of ruthlesscompetition.” To succeed, this “new order” must demonstrate that it is betterfor the laborer as well as for capital and the consumer.[10][part0016.html#fn10]The NCF began its drive for workmen’s compensation in 1908, establishing anIndustrial Insurance Commission with George W. Perkins as chairman. Thiscommission was rather quiescent, however; the major drive was launched thefollowing year when new president Seth Low appointed past-president AugustBelmont Jr. as head of a new Department on Compensation for Industrial Accidentsand Their Prevention. From then on, the NCF was at the center of the movementfor workmen’s compensation legislation. Among those involved in the NCFagitation were the prominent progressive reformer Louis D. Brandeis, active inthe Massachusetts branch of the NCF, the vice president of Metropolitan LifeInsurance Company, and a representative of the Sage Foundation Fund. At the 1909annual meeting, workmen’s compensation was strongly defended by George M.Gillette, head of Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company and president of theMinnesota Employers’ Association; Louis B. Schram, head of the labor Committeeof the U.S. Brewers Association, and Major J.G. Pangborn of the Baltimore andOhio Railroad. By 1909, too, the NCF had managed to convert Samuel Gompers andthe AFL to the idea of compensation laws.In the meanwhile, by 1910 the small manufacturers of the NAM had also beenconverted to workmen’s compensation. By the spring of 1911, journalist WillIrwin noted that the entire business community was now in favor of workmen’scompensation laws. The only remaining holdouts against this “scientific system,”he opined, were “a few old-time manufacturers who can see nothing but nextyear’s dollar.”[11] [part0016.html#fn11]The NCF proceeded to draw up model workmen’s compensation bills and to agitatefor them on the state and federal levels. There were no state laws before 1909;but, as in so many other areas of statism in 20th-century America, PresidentRoosevelt led the way by pushing a federal compensation act through Congress in1908.The actual drive for workmen’s compensation legislation was sparked by AugustBelmont Jr. Shortly after becoming head of the NCF Compensation Department in1909, Belmont appointed a legal committee headed by P. Tecumseh Sherman, aconservative lawyer and former Commissioner of Labor in New York, to draw up amodel bill. Sherman was particularly inspired by the German system of compulsorymedical, old age, and accident insurance. Realizing that this comprehensivewelfare state model could not be established in the United States all at once,he frankly called his proposed model state workmen’s compensation bill “ahalfway measure—a mere entering wedge.”[12] [part0016.html#fn12] Completed bythe spring of 1910, the model bill was sent to all state governors andlegislators interested in the problem.In contrast to the stereotype of older historians, the major opposition to theSherman Bill within the NCF was from big businessmen urging Sherman to have thecourage to be far more radical. One leading critic within the Federation wasRaynal C. Bolling of U.S. Steel, who declared that workmen’s compensation shouldbe nothing less than universal and compulsory (Sherman had extended it only tohazardous industries), and applied to agriculture and domestic work as well asmanufacturing. Also leading an unsuccessful call for more radical legislationwere George M. Gillette, head of the Minnesota Employers’ Association, and HughV. Mercer, a Minnesotan appointed to study workmen’s compensation in that state.In 1909, New York became the first state to pass a compulsory workmen’scompensation law. After the NCF flooded the states with the model Sherman billthe following year, former-president Theodore Roosevelt addressed the annualmeeting of the NCF and called for workmen’s compensation laws. During the year1911, the number of state workmen’s compensation laws jumped from one tothirteen.But a temporary hitch suddenly developed in the rapid march to Paradise. In thespring of 1911, the New York Court of Appeals in Ives v. South Buffalo RailwayCo. unanimously held the compensation law to be unconstitutional, an assault onthe common law and deprivation of property without due process. In many ways,the courts proved to be the last stronghold of the old laissez-faire order.While the courts had outlawed compensation acts before without provoking muchcomment, times were now changing rapidly. Teddy Roosevelt led the howls ofoutrage, writing that the path of necessary “social reform” was being blocked.The progressive magazine Survey significantly and trenchantly noted that thecourt would not have struck down workmen’s compensation “if a board of broadgauge business men [with]... responsibility for vast property interests on theirshoulders” had constituted the judges’ bench. Survey particularly pointed to thewise statesmanship in this matter of J.P. Morgan, E.H. Gary, Andrew Carnegie,and Jacob H. Schiff—all but the last solidly in the Morgan ambit, and the latterthe head of Kuhn-Loeb. Sure enough, the Ives decision was promptly denounced bySherman, the National Civic Federation, and by the redoubtable Francis LyndeStetson, long-time Morgan lawyer and now attorney for Morgan’s InternationalHarvester Company. The NCF called for Congress to pass federal compensationlegislation.Moving quickly and obediently to bury Ives, the New York State legislature in1913 proposed a constitutional amendment to remove the protection of due processin the case of workmen’s compensation. In the former times, this drastic assaulton private property would have caused a great furor; now it passedoverwhelmingly both in the legislature and among the public. In December 1913,the Conference of New York State Republicans, led by the formidable Elihu Root,unanimously passed a resolution hailing the new amendment and trumpeting the newspirit of government intervention. “Changed and changing social and industrialconditions impose new duties on government,” the Republicans opined. The partymust therefore “meet industrial and social demands of modern civilization.”[13][part0016.html#fn13]Seeing the handwriting on the wall, other state courts began to ratifycompensation legislation. By 1920, all but six states had workmen’s compensationlaws in force, and the federal government had widened its coverage to all of itsown employees.[14] [part0016.html#fn14]5. MONOPOLIZING PUBLIC UTILITIESAnother aspect of progressive reform pushed by the NCF was the transformation ofpublic utilities in the United States. The thrust here was to change from aroughly free market in utilities toward outright grants of monopoly privilege.The public utility—the gas, electric, or trolley franchises—was to be protectedfrom competition and regulated by the state or municipality so as to provide aguaranteed, fixed rate of profit. For those lucky enough to obtain utilityfranchises, this seemed like paradise.The NCF established a Commission on Public Ownership of Public Utilities in late1905, ostensibly to engage in a scientific, impartial study of the publicutility question and of the results of public ownership, which had become theprevalent system in Europe. The Commission was chaired by Melville E. Ingalls,chairman of the board of the Big Four Railroad, and its first vice-chairman wasJohn Mitchell of the United Mine Workers. Other members of the executivecommittee of the Commission included Frank A. Vanderlip of theRockefeller-oriented National City Bank, prominent investment banker Isaac N.Seligman, wealthy reformer Jacob Riis, Louis D. Brandeis, and utilities magnateSamuel Insull, who was previously affiliated with Thomas Edison and GeneralElectric. It also included the leading progressive economist John R. Commons ofthe University of Wisconsin. Ingalls and Commons were featured in a tour ofBritain and the U.S., studying public utilities. Finally, in 1907, theCommission issued a three-volume report, whose tone was set by Samuel Insull andwhose views were close to that of the National Electric Light Association, thetrade association of the electric utility industry. Public utilities were to belegal grants of monopoly, to be regulated by public utility commissionsestablished by government. In contrast to the NELA, however, the NCF commissiontook no stand on municipal ownership.[15] [part0016.html#fn15]Insull had formed these views nearly a decade earlier, learning them fromChicago traction magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes. Yerkes, in the late 1890s, had aproblem, his system of public utilities could, under state law, only receivemonopoly franchises for 20 years’ duration, and hence one part or another of hisutility empire had to have its franchise renewed every few years. Yerkes waswilling and able to bribe city councilmen to keep renewing the franchises, buthe found that he could not float long-term bonds for companies that might losetheir monopoly status in a few years’ time.Taking advantage of the election of a purchasable Republican governor, Yerkesmanaged to have introduced a series of bills in the 1897 Illinois legislature,which presaged Wisconsin progressivism by a decade. They would have extended alltraction franchises by 50 years and removed control of transportation from citycouncils and transferred it to an expert, allegedly non-partisan stateregulatory commission. This not only would have placed the mantle of science onmonopoly privilege; it would, of course, have considerably reduced Charles TysonYerkes’ bribery costs.While Yerkes’ bills presaged progressive reform, he came a cropper because ofanother aspect of the burgeoning progressive ethos that he had violated. A vitalpart of urban progressivism, as shall be seen further below, was a freneticattack on the “corruption” of politicians, and it was the bribery issue thatlaid Yerkes low.[16] [part0016.html#fn16] Even such progressive businessorganizations as the powerful Chicago Civic Federation turned on Yerkes, and hismeasures went down to defeat.[17] [part0016.html#fn17]Learning from Yerkes’ abortive program and applying it to electric utilities,Samuel Insull launched progressivism in public utilities in his presidentialaddress before the National Electric Light Association in June 1898. He urgedhis fellow electric utility magnates to get the industry regulated by statecommissions with the full power to fix rates and the quality of service. Incontrast to Yerkes’ bold grab for monopoly, Insull, more sensitive to publicrelations, stressed the government’s rate-making power rather than the attendantlong-run monopoly franchise. Most of the utilities executives were shocked atthis assault on laissez-faire, but Insull garnered a few supporters andappointed them to the association’s new Committee on Legislative Policy.While the Committee languished for lack of support in the industry, Insullinstructed the employees of his Chicago Edison and Commonwealth Electriccompanies in advertising and public relations, and established one of the firstpublic relations departments in industry in 1901.The threat of the municipal rate regulation and municipal ownership of publicutilities, which had given rise to the NCF’s Commission study in 1905, providedan impetus for the eventual success of the regulated monopoly movement. The ideaof municipal ownership of electric utilities had been launched in the 1880s and1890s by electric equipment salesmen, who wanted electric power subsidized bythe taxpayers, and gas companies, which wanted to stifle the growing competitionof electricity by having it supplied by local governments. Municipal ownershipgrew after the mid-1890s and reached a peak in 1905–06 when interest yields werelow and the municipal bond market was strong. Transportation companies were theprincipal area of government ownership, but public electric companies grew aswell. From 1902 to 1907, the number of publicly-owned plants were growing attwice the rate of private electric plants. This was particularly true in thesmall cities; more than 80% of municipally-owned electric plants were in citiesof less than 5,000 population.In response to this trend, the National Electric Light Association was moved toestablish a Committee on Municipal Ownership, which grew two years later intothe Committee on Public Policy. The new Committee included Insull and most ofthe people on his earlier Legislative Policy Committee. The new Public PolicyCommittee lobbied energetically for state regulatory commissions, basing itspropaganda on its own report of 1907, which paralleled the recommendations ofthe NCF Commission report of the same year. The NELA Public Policy Committeereport stressed that the NELA should favor state commission regulation, with thepower to control franchise, establish rates, and enforce a uniform system ofaccounting as well as making all pertinent information public—thus adding to thecartelization and decreasing competition in the utility industries. TheCommittee particularly stressed the threat of municipal ownership as thealternative, deliberately ignoring the third alternative of free competition andfree markets.[18] [part0016.html#fn18]The municipal ownership threat died shortly thereafter, living long enough toact as a goal toward monopoly privilege. The Panic of 1907 drove up interestrates and shattered the municipal bond markets, especially for the weak smallercities.[19] [part0016.html#fn19]The National Civic Federation was never content to stop at theory; theory, inthe pragmatic progressive tradition, was to be the groundwork for politicalaction. The NCF Commission report was used by Professor Commons, one of itsauthors, to draw up the Wisconsin public utilities law as part of Commons’promotion of the “Wisconsin Idea” while working for Charles McCarthy’sLegislative Reference Bureau in that state. The progressives in Wisconsin pushedthe law through in the spring of 1907, establishing the Wisconsin RailroadCommission and setting the model for the other states. Similar laws quicklyfollowed in New York and Massachusetts. The result was the monopolization of thepublic utilities industry, the end of competitive “discriminatory” pricing, andthe raising of rates. As Weinstein sums it up:> By 1909 many industry people had begun to look favorably on regulation by> state commissions and to understand the advantages of taking utilities> regulation out of politics. The underlying principles of the regulatory> legislation supported responsible private ownership, and the experts appointed> to the new commission were almost invariably conservative in that they did not> question the framework of the utilities industry. The result, therefore, was> to introduce stability in the industry and to “raise public morality” through> the removal of discriminatory rates.[20] [part0016.html#fn20]Spearheading the NCF drive for state public utilities regulation was EmersonMcMillin, banker and president and director of several gas, electric, andtraction companies; collaborating with him was Teddy Roosevelt’s ex-secretaryGeorge B. Cortelyou, now head of Consolidated Gas of New York. When someutilities magnates balked at the possible effect of regulatory commissions onthe floating of utilities bonds, McMillin shrewdly pointed out that stateutilities commissions performed the valuable function of supervising utilities’finances and their bond issues, both calculated to assist in the financing ofpublic utilities.By the fall of 1913, Ralph Easley was able to write to President Seth Low of thesuccess of the drive for public utilities regulation. “Twenty five years ago,”he exulted “we would have regarded this as a species of socialism,” but nowutilities are submitting, with many railways even embracing regulation,“joyfully in some cases.”[21] [part0016.html#fn21]6. REGULATING INDUSTRYOn the national level, the NCF, as might be expected, was close to PresidentRoosevelt and his Bureau of Corporations. In its first annual report in 1904 theBureau attacked the Sherman Antitrust Act and proposed that it be replaced byanother kind of legislation, one that regulates trusts by eliminating “improperrebates, discrimination, and unfair combinations.” Each one of these proposedcrackdowns was well calculated to cripple the most effective forms ofcompetition and the market’s ability to break up cartels and monopoly.The NCF leadership then moved to draw up proposed legislation along theRooseveltian lines. Spurred by Melville E. Ingalls, chairman of the Big FourRailroad, and more especially by August Belmont Jr., the NCF first established acommission to rewrite the antitrust laws. But soon it concluded that morepowerful and dramatic action was needed. Drawing on the CCF experience of theConference on Trusts, the NCF called in Professor Jenks, steeped in theexperience of organizing the previous conference. Before going ahead with thenew conference, Easley won the unofficial but powerful blessing of PresidentRoosevelt and his Secretary of Commerce and Labor Oscar Straus.The NCF’s National Conference on Trusts and Combinations was held in Chicago inOctober, 1907. It drew 492 delegates from 147 delegations appointed by stategovernors, business and labor associations, and civic groups. Businessmen werein the overwhelmingly majority, seconded by a sprinkling of academics,politicians, and reformers. The revered president Nicholas Murray Butler ofColumbia served as chairman and convenient front man. The Conference urged thatrailroads be permitted to enter into rate agreements, as recommended by the ICCand Roosevelt, that Congress establish a commission to amend the Sherman Act toregulate competition, establish federal licensing of corporations, and endorsetrusts “in the public interest” (in short, Teddy Roosevelt’s “good trusts”), andthat the Bureau of Corporations be empowered to require compulsory publicityfrom large corporations. It was a program designed to quicken the hearts of bigcorporations and the Roosevelt administration.So delighted were Roosevelt and the Congressional leaders with the Conferenceproposals that they easily induced the NCF to draw up the required bill and notwait for any commission. Seth Low, new president of the NCF, established aninformal committee of leading corporatists to draw up the desired bill forindustrial regulation. It was truly a gathering of the eagles. Businessmen onthe committee included among others Judge Gary, chairman of the board of U.S.Steel, Isaac N. Seligman and James Speyer, top New York investment bankers, theubiquitous Morgan man, George W. Perkins, and August Belmont Jr. Labor leadersincluded Samuel Gompers and John Mitchell, while progressive academia was wellrepresented by President Butler and Jeremiah W. Jenks; from the media there camethe inevitable Albert Shaw. Also on the committee were Judge Alton B. Parker,who had made the disastrous Democratic run for the presidency in 1904, andHerbert Knox Smith, Roosevelt’s Commissioner of Corporations, representing theadministration. Actually drawing up the bill were two formidable and alsoubiquitous lawyers in the Morgan ambit: Morgan’s own attorney Francis LyndeStetson and Victor Morawetz, counsel to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa FeRailroad.Working eagerly and at top speed, this formidable committee came up with a billin February 1908, and it was approved by the NCF shortly afterwards. Workingclosely and approvingly with Stetson and Morawetz was Commissioner Smith. TheNCF bill, obediently introduced into Congress by Representative William P.Hepburn, gave the Bureau of Corporations power to approve any corporate contractor merger in advance, thus lending a selective imprimatur of the federalexecutive to combinations, and to supervise and veto a host of daily operationsof business firms. Unions were also to be exempt from the antitrust laws.A firestorm of opposition descended upon Congress, however, from small- andmedium-size businesses across the country. Organizations of such businesses,including the National Association of Manufacturers, the Merchants Associationof New York, and the Board of Trade of New York, opposed the legislation. Theyobjected not only to the pro-union provision but also to allowing the executivebranch to pick and choose between good and bad corporate actions. The Rooseveltadministration was forced to withdraw its support for the bill, and Perkinswrote to Smith that “if the opponents to Governmental supervision could onlyknow how intelligently and how fairly you have worked for the very highest andbest interests of American corporations, I am sure they would abandon theirpresent attitude.” As Seth Low correctly wrote to the President, “the largeinterests, such as Judge Gary represents, are still loyally behind our bill. Theobjection comes from the mercantile element ...”[22] [part0016.html#fn22]It was time to regroup, and the NCF then turned to an alternative approachsuggested by Ingalls and Andrew Carnegie to accomplish the same purpose bysetting up a new interstate trade commission, to do for general business, as itwas often put, what the ICC had already done for the railroads. The embryo ofthe Federal Trade Commission had come into being.[23] [part0016.html#fn23]7. ALLIED GROUP: THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABOR LEGISLATIONIf the National Civic Federation was an organization of corporatist bigbusinessmen with a sprinkling of intellectual and academic allies, the AmericanAssociation for Labor Legislation (AALL) was an organization of corporatistintellectuals financed by Big Business.The AALL was a spinoff of the American Economic Association, which hadoriginally been organized to foster the new spirit of statism among economists.The AALL was organized by a committee established at the 1905 annual meeting ofthe AEA, and its first annual meeting two years later was held in conjunctionwith the meeting of the economists’ association. First president of the AALL wasthe inevitable Richard T. Ely, and its long-time executive secretary was John B.Andrews, a research associate of Ely and John R. Commons, and a collaboratorwith Commons in various tomes on industry and labor.The AALL worked the labor and “social welfare” end of the corporatist street. Itwas organized as a branch of the International Association for Labor Legislationand received a government subsidy from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to publishan English edition of the Bulletin of the International Labor Bureau.As self-proclaimed “scientists,” AALL claimed not to take a partisan stand ineconomic or industrial conflicts, but it pretentiously asserted that its “onlyallegiance is to the general welfare.” As such, it supported uniform laborlegislation among the states. In addition, a 1914 AALL national conference,including businessmen, state, and labor officials, agreed on the idea ofstabilizing employment, on calling for state and federal unemployment agenciesto provide tax-supported free employment service to workers and employers, andon the desirability of some form of compulsory unemployment insurance. Theconference quickly inspired Governor Martin Glynn, Democrat of New York, to pushthrough a bill establishing a state employment agency. In the following year,AALL called for a planned program of public works to relieve unemployment—aprogram well calculated, of course, to subsidize the construction industry.In subsequent years, AALL drafted model bills pushing for employment agencies,workmen’s compensation, compulsory health insurance, increased safetylegislation, a minimum wage unemploying marginal workers, and child labor laws,a “humanitarian” program outlawing the employment of minors and thereby freeingadult workers from their unwelcome and often successful competition. In 1916,Congress passed the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill, which had been drafted by AALL andwhich applied workmen’s compensation to federal employees.[24][part0016.html#fn24]The idea behind the seemingly innocuous and merely “efficient” drive for uniformlabor legislation, and also behind much of the push for workmen’s compensationand other social welfare measures, was to enable paternalistic employers, whohad already established private welfare programs, to impose higher costs ontheir “non-socially conscious” competitors. As Eakins puts it:> A number of pieces of Progressive legislation were not only supported but also> were, in a number of important instances, drafted by [enlightened]> businessmen. These men, many of them “corporate liberals,” could support some> regulation on the grounds that a uniform application of the laws by the states> or the federal government would permit the socially conscious employer to> compete on an even footing with the individualistic cost-cutting employer.> There would be no room for “unscrupulous” [i.e., successfully competitive]> employers.He goes on with a candid quote from the New York Branch of AALL in 1910: “To setlimits to this competition, to establish standards in law which it cannotovercome, and thus to put an end to the process of exploitation are the meaningand purpose” of the AALL.[25] [part0016.html#fn25]AALL included the standard business-politician mix, but with a broader spectrumof statist intellectuals than the NCF. A particularly important politician wasWoodrow Wilson, while Governor of New Jersey and later while president; Wilsonwas an officer of AALL for five years. Wilson’s Secretary of Commerce,businessman William Redfield, was also active in the AALL. Unionists Gompers andMitchell were also in AALL. Corporatist intellectuals included such NCFstalwarts as Ely, Commons, and Jenks, and AALL published a book by Jenks (1910)on Governmental Action for Social Welfare. NCF consultant Henry R. Seager,professor of political economy at Columbia, was a three-term president of AALL,and in his AALL-published work, Social Insurance, A Program of Social Reform(1910) Seager set forth much of the basic AALL doctrine. He called for “anaggressive program of governmental control and regulation” on behalf of the“common welfare.” The idea of freedom from government interference is obsolete,Professor Seager thundered, and must be replaced by active government promotionof the common welfare. His ideal was the compulsory state insurance plans foraccident, disease, and unemployment modelled after Europe. Three years earlier,Seager had pioneered in proposing a uniform minimum wage law.[26][part0016.html#fn26]A major difference from NCF is that AALL included a raft of frankly leftist andsocialist intellectuals; its spectrum of statist and collectivist intellectualswas considerably broader than NCF. This included socialists such as FlorenceKelley, Victor Berger, W.D.P. Bliss, and Robert Hunter.Corporatist big business control remained secure, however. Officers of AALLincluded corporate liberal financiers and industrialists like the BostonianEdward A. Filene, and Charles M. Cabot, Gerard Swope of General Electric andinvestment banker Isaac Seligman. Financers of AALL included such financialnotables as Judge Elbert Gary of United States Steel, Mrs. Madeline Astor, JohnD. Rockefeller, Anne Morgan, daughter of J.P., and the Kuhn-Loeb-connectedbanker Felix Warburg.Big business support and control of AALL demonstrates the fallacy of thetraditional sharp separation by historians of progressives into “businessmoderates” and “radical intellectuals.” In actuality, there was no genuineseparation, but rather an interpenetration, a happy collaboration between bigbusiness supporters and intellectuals, whether moderate or radical corporatist,marching hand-in-hand into the New Order.[27] [part0016.html#fn27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [part0016.html#ft1] [Editor’s footnote] Rothbard here is alluding to thefamous rebirth of the “Alliance of Throne and Altar,” which occurred betweenprogressive economists and government in the early 20th century. During theProgressive Era, big business turned to big government in order to cartelize,and both in turn needed planners to sell their interventions to the public andconvince them that government sponsored monopolies were not being created.Instead of saying that the king was divine, the new court apologists said biggovernment was necessary to improve welfare. In return, the collectivistintellectuals would benefit from the power and prestige of planning the newsystem, which was more lucrative than what existed in a laissez-faire regime.The secularization of the Alliance and the transformation of economists duringthis time from laissez-faire philosophers to activist government planners washeavily related to the fact that many Yankee postmillennial pietist reformerswent to Bismarck’s Germany to get their Ph.D.s and became instilled with Germansocialism and centralization.

Far from beingchampioned by the poor and middle classes, this drive was seen as weakeningethnic-liturgical power in politics by removing local ward influence on thepolitical structure.

Dilorenzo, “The Myth of Natural Monopoly,” Review of AustrianEconomics 9, no. 2 (1996): 43–58. As Dilorenzo, borrowing from Rothbard, pointsout, one of the main problems with “public utilities” is that they occur onpublic, and not private, streets, which interferes with the ability ofentrepreneurs to effectively engage in economic calculation.Of course, in so called “natural monopolies” earning profits, as with all goods,there is always competitive pressure from other potential innovative producersof substitute products. Cost-price and franchise regulation leads to inefficientand cumbersome firms unable to quickly change when their costs change, reducesrivalrous innovation, incentivizes firms to “transfer” some of their profitsinto costs, and invites regulatory capture. Moreover, it neglects the fact thata firm’s costs and therefore prices are not objectively available to theregulator, but must be appraised and discovered by the entrepreneur.[22] [part0016.html#ft22] See Weinstein, The Corporate Ideal in the LiberalState, pp. 77–82.

The five- man commissionwas dominated by pro-business sentiment from the outset, and in the words ofprominent commission member Edward N. Hurley, it was intended “to do for generalbusiness” what the ICC, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Agriculturedid for railroads, bankers, and farmers. Influential advisors to the Commissionincluded familiar names such as Louis D. Brandeis and Victor Morawetz, railroadexecutive Walker D. Hines, and Arthur Eddy. The latter was an importantcorporate lawyer who proclaimed in his influential book that “Competition isWar, and ‘War is Hell’.”The acts helped eliminate competitive price discrimination and various marketforms, such as holding companies and tying agreements. This benefited largerexisting firms and smaller firms engaged in intrastate commerce. With regards tolarger businesses, which vertically or horizontally integrated due to costadvantages, they would benefit at the expense of their medium-size competitors,who could only afford to partially integrate through various market agreementsnow deemed “restrictions” on competition. The FTC would later hold “tradepractice conferences” in the 1920s in order to meet with industry members tofigure out “unfair” practices, such as price discrimination and secret pricecutting.

As aresult, they were intensely worried about the flood of “inferior” immigrantsfrom Asia and parts of Europe diluting the labor pool and undercutting the wagesof the superior Anglo-Saxon white man. They were also concerned about femaleworkers, who were undercutting the male breadwinners and not being properlyallocated to the household to raise children. A minimum wage and other laborregulations, such as immigration restriction and maximum hour legislation, wouldunemploy the less skilled immigrants and females and protect the jobs of thesuperior white males.

However, it is not really egalitarianism but elitism in adifferent form, since everyone must be made equal except the intellectuals andopinion molders, who are still chosen to plan society and run people’s lives.See Murray Rothbard, “Egalitarianism and the Elites,” Review of AustrianEconomics 8, no. 2 (1995): 39–57.[25] [part0016.html#ft25] Eakins, The Development of Corporate Liberal PolicyResearch, pp. 84–85. [Editor’s remarks] This “exploitative competition” wasalready declining regardless of recent progressive legislative efforts. Since1900, workers’ living standards rose through higher real wages, a decline inhours of work per week, reduced child labor, earlier retirement, and betterworking standards. This occurred primarily due to the normal progression of anunfettered capitalist economy and not legislation that only codified existingtrends.

The broader period marks an era in which the entire American polity—fromeconomics to urban planning to medicine to social work to the licensing ofprofessions to the ideology of intellectuals—was transformed from a roughlylaissez-faire system based on individual rights to one of state planning andcontrol. In the sphere of public policy issues closely related to the life ofthe family, most of the change took place, or at least began, in the latterdecades of the nineteenth century. In this paper we shall use the analyticinsights of the “new political history” to examine the ways in which theso-called progressives sought to shape and control select aspects of Americanfamily life.1. ETHNORELIGIOUS CONFLICT AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLSIn the last two decades, the advent of the “new political history” hastransformed our understanding of the political party system and the basis ofpolitical conflict in nineteenth century America. In contrast to the partysystems of the twentieth century (the “fourth” party system, 1896–1932, ofRepublican supremacy; the “fifth” party system, 1932–? of Democratic supremacy),the nineteenth century political parties were not bland coalitions of interestswith virtually the same amorphous ideology, with each party blurring what isleft of its image during campaigns to appeal to the large independent center. Inthe nineteenth century, each party offered a fiercely contrasting ideology, andpolitical parties performed the function of imposing a common ideology ondiverse sectional and economic interests. During campaigns, the ideology and thepartisanship became fiercer and even more clearly demarcated, since the objectwas not to appeal to independent moderates—there were virtually none—but tobring out the vote of one’s own partisans. Such partisanship and sharpalternatives marked the “second” American party system (Whig versus Democrat,approximately 1830 to the mid-1850s) and the “third” party system (closelyfought Republican versus Democrat, mid-1850s to 1896).Another important insight of the new political history is that the partisanpassion devoted by rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans to national economicissues, stemmed from a similar passion devoted at the local and state level towhat would now be called “social” issues. Furthermore, that political conflict,from the 1830s on, stemmed from a radical transformation that took place inAmerican Protestantism as a result of the revival movement of the 1830s.The new revival movement swept the Protestant churches, particularly in theNorth, like wildfire. In contrast to the old creedal Calvinist churches thatstressed the importance of obeying God’s law as expressed in the church creed,the new “pietism” was very different. The pietist doctrine was essentially asfollows: Specific creeds of various churches or sects do not matter. Neitherdoes obedience to the rituals or liturgies of the particular church. What countsfor salvation is only each individual being “born again”—a direct confrontationbetween the individual and God, a mystical and emotional conversion in which theindividual achieves salvation. The rite of baptism, to the pietist, thereforebecomes secondary; of primary importance is his or her personal moment ofconversion.But if the specific church or creed becomes submerged in a vague Christianinterdenominationalism, then the individual Christian is left on his own tograpple with the problems of salvation. Pietism, as it swept AmericanProtestantism in the 1830s, took two very different forms in North and South,with very different political implications. The Southerners, at least until the1890s, became “salvationist pietists,” that is, they believed that the emotionalexperience of individual regeneration, of being born again, was enough to ensuresalvation. Religion was a separate compartment of life, a verticalindividual-God relation carrying no imperative to transform man-made culture andinterhuman relations.In contrast, the Northerners, particularly in the areas inhabited by “Yankees,”adopted a far different form of pietism, “evangelical pietism.” The evangelicalpietists believed that man could achieve salvation by an act of free will. Moreparticularly, they also believed that it was necessary to a person’s ownsalvation—and not just a good idea—to try his best to ensure the salvation ofeveryone else in society:> “To spread holiness,” to create that Christian commonwealth by bringing all> men to Christ, was the divinely ordered duty of the “saved.” Their mandate was> “to transform the world into the image of Christ.”[1] [part0017.html#fn1]Since each individual is alone to wrestle with problems of sin and salvation,without creed or ritual of the church to sustain him, the evangelical duty musttherefore be to use the state, the social arm of the integrated Christiancommunity, to stamp out temptation and occasions for sin. Only in this way couldone perform one’s divinely mandated duty to maximize the salvation of others.[2][part0017.html#fn2] And to the evangelical pietist, sin took on an extremelybroad definition, placing the requirements for holiness far beyond that of otherChristian groups. As one antipietist Christian put it, “They saw sin where Goddid not.” In particular, sin was any and all forms of contact with liquor, anddoing anything except praying and going to church on Sunday. Any forms ofgambling, dancing, theater, reading of novels—in short, secular enjoyment of anykind—were considered sinful.The forms of sin that particularly agitated the evangelicals were those theyheld to interfere with the theological free will of individuals, making themunable to achieve salvation. Liquor was sinful because, they alleged, itcrippled the free will of the imbibers. Another particular source of sin wasRoman Catholicism, in which priests and bishops, arms of the Pope (whom theyidentified as the Antichrist), ruled the minds and therefore crippled thetheological freedom of will of members of the church.Evangelical pietism particularly appealed to, and therefore took root among, the“Yankees,” i.e., that cultural group that originated in (especially rural) NewEngland and emigrated widely to populate northern and western New York, northernOhio, northern Indiana, and northern Illinois. The Yankees were natural“cultural imperialists,” people who were wont to impose their values andmorality on other groups; as such, they took quite naturally to imposing theirform of pietism through whatever means were available, including the use of thecoercive power of the state.In contrast to evangelical pietists were, in addition to small groups ofold-fashioned Calvinists, two great Christian groups, the Catholics and theLutherans (or at least, the high-church variety of Lutheran), who were“liturgicals” (or “ritualists”) rather than pietists. The liturgicals saw theroad to salvation in joining the particular church, obeying its rituals, andmaking use of its sacraments; the individual was not alone with only hisemotions and the state to protect him. There was no particular need, then, forthe state to take on the functions of the church. Furthermore, the liturgicalshad a much more relaxed and rational view of what sin really was; for instance,excessive drinking might be sinful, but liquor per se surely was not.The evangelical pietists, from the 1830s on, were the northern Protestants ofBritish descent, as well as the Lutherans from Scandinavia and a minority ofpietist German synods; the liturgicals were the Roman Catholics and thehigh-church Lutherans, largely German.Very rapidly, the political parties reflected a virtually one-to-one correlationof this ethnoreligious division: the Whig, and later the Republican Partyconsisting chiefly of the pietists, and the Democratic Party encompassing almostall the liturgicals. And for almost a century, on a state and local level, theWhig/Republican pietists tried desperately and determinedly to stamp out liquorand all Sunday activities except church (of course, drinking liquor on Sundaywas a heinous double sin). As to the Catholic Church, the pietists tried torestrict or abolish immigration, since people coming from Germany and Ireland,liturgicals, were outnumbering people from Britain and Scandinavia. Failing thatand despairing of doing anything about adult Catholics poisoned by agents of theVatican, the evangelical pietists decided to concentrate on saving Catholic andLutheran youth by trying to eliminate the parochial schools, through which bothreligious groups transmitted their precious religious and social values to theyoung. The object, as many pietists put it, was to “Christianize the Catholics,”to force Catholic and Lutheran children into public schools, which could then beused as an instrument of pietist Protestantization. Since the Yankees had earlytaken to the idea of imposing communal civic virtue and obedience through thepublic schools, they were particularly receptive to this new reason foraggrandizing public education.To all of these continuing aggressions by what they termed “those fanatics,” theliturgicals fought back with equal fervor. Particularly bewildered were theGermans who, Lutheran and Catholic alike, were accustomed to the entire familyhappily attending beer gardens together on Sundays after church and who nowfound the “fanatic” pietists trying desperately to outlaw this pleasurable andseemingly innocent activity. The pietist Protestant attacks on private andparochial schools fatally threatened the preservation and maintenance of theliturgicals’ cultural and religious values; and since large numbers of theCatholics and Lutherans were immigrants, parochial schools also served tomaintain group affinities in a new and often hostile world—especially the worldof Anglo-Saxon pietism. In the case of the Germans, it also meant, for severaldecades, preserving parochial teaching in the beloved German language, asagainst fierce pressures for Anglicization.In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, as Catholic immigrationgrew and the Democratic Party moved slowly but surely toward a majority status,the Republican, and—more broadly—pietist pressures became more intense. Thepurpose of the public school, to the pietists, was “to unify and makehomogeneous the society.” There was no twentieth century concern for separatingreligion and the public school system. To the contrary, in most northernjurisdictions only pietist-Protestant church members were allowed to be teachersin the public schools. Daily reading of the Protestant Bible, daily Protestantprayers and Protestant hymns were common in the public schools, and schooltextbooks were rife with anti-Catholic propaganda. Thus, New York City schooltextbooks spoke broadly of “the deceitful Catholics,” and pounded into theirchildren, Catholic and Protestant alike, the message that “Catholics arenecessarily, morally, intellectually, infallibly, a stupid race.”[3][part0017.html#fn3]Teachers delivered homilies on the evils of Popery, and also on deeply feltpietist theological values: the wickedness of alcohol (the “demon rum”) and theimportance of keeping the Sabbath. In the 1880s and 1890s, zealous pietistsbegan working ardently for antialcohol instruction as a required part of thepublic-school curriculum; by 1901, every state in the Union required instructionin temperance.Since most Catholic children went to public rather than parochial schools, theCatholic authorities were understandably anxious to purge the schools ofProtestant requirements and ceremonies, and of anti-Catholic textbooks. To thepietists, these attempts to de-Protestantize the public schools were intolerable“Romish aggression.” The whole point of the public schools was moral andreligious homogenization, and here the Catholics were disrupting the attempt tomake American society holy—to produce, through the public school and theProtestant gospel, “a morally and politically homogeneous people.” As Kleppnerwrites:> When they [the pietists] spoke of “moral education,” they had in mind> principles of morality shared in common by the adherents of gospel religion,> for in the public school all children, even those whose parents were enslaved> by “Lutheran formalism or Romish superstition,” would be exposed to the Bible.> That alone was cause for righteous optimism, for they believed the Bible to be> “the agent in converting the soul,” “the volume that makes human beings> men.”[4] [part0017.html#fn4]In this way, “America [would] be Saved Through the Children.”[5][part0017.html#fn5]The pietists were therefore incensed that the Catholics were attempting to blockthe salvation of America’s children—and eventually of America itself—all at theorders of a “foreign potentate.” Thus, the New Jersey Methodist Conference of1870 lashed out with their deepest feelings against this Romish obstructionism:> Resolved, That we greatly deprecate the effort which is being made by “Haters> of Light,” and especially by an arrogant priesthood, to exclude the Bible from> the Public Schools of our land; and that we will do all in our power to defeat> the well-defined and wicked design of this “Mother of Harlots.”[6]> [part0017.html#fn6]Throughout the nineteenth century, “nativist” attacks on “foreigners” and theforeign-born were really attacks on liturgical immigrants. Immigrants fromBritain or Scandinavia, pietists all, were “good Americans” as soon as they gotoff the boat. It was the diverse culture of the other immigrants that had to behomogenized and molded into that of pietist America. Thus, the New EnglandMethodist Conference of 1889 declared:> We are a nation of remnants, ravellings from the Old World. ... The public> school is one of the remedial agencies which work in our society to diminish> this ... and to hasten the compacting of these heterogeneous materials into a> solid nature.[7] [part0017.html#fn7]Or, as a leading citizen of Boston declared, “the only way to elevate theforeign population was to make Protestants of their children.”[8][part0017.html#fn8]Since the cities of the North, in the late nineteenth century, were becomingincreasingly filled with Catholic immigrants, pietist attacks on sinful citiesand on immigrants both became aspects of the anti-liturgical struggle for ahomogeneous Anglo-Saxon pietist culture. The Irish were particular butts ofpietist scorn; a New York City textbook bitterly warned that continuedimmigration could make America “the common sewer of Ireland,” filled withdrunken and depraved Irishmen.[9] [part0017.html#fn9]The growing influx of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe toward the endof the nineteenth century seemed to pose even greater problems for the pietistprogressives, but they did not shrink from the task. As Ellwood P. Cubberley ofStanford University, the nation’s outstanding progressive historian ofeducation, declared, southern and eastern Europeans have> served to dilute tremendously our national stock, and to corrupt our civil> life. ... Everywhere these people tend to settle in groups or settlements, and> to set up here their national manners, customs, and observances. Our task is> to break up these groups or settlements, to assimilate and amalgamate these> people as a part of our American race and to implant in their children ... the> Anglo-Saxon conception of righteousness, law and order, and popular> government ...[10] [part0017.html#fn10]2. PROGRESSIVES, PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND THE FAMILY: THE CASE OF SAN FRANCISCOThe molding of children was of course the key to homogenization and the key ingeneral to the progressive vision of tight social control over the individualvia the instrument of the state. The eminent University of Wisconsin sociologistEdward Alsworth Ross, a favorite of Theodore Roosevelt and the veritable epitomeof a progressive social scientist, summed it up thus: The role of the publicofficial, and in particular of the public school teacher, is “to collect littleplastic lumps of human dough from private households and shape them on thesocial kneadingboard.”[11] [part0017.html#fn11]The view of Ross and the other progressives was that the state must take up thetask of control and inculcation of moral values once performed by parents andchurch. The conflict between middle- and upper-class urban progressiveAnglo-Saxon Protestants and largely working-class Catholics was sharplydelineated in the battle over control of the San Francisco public school systemduring the second decade of the twentieth century. The highly popular AlfredRoncovieri, a French-Italian Catholic, was the elected school superintendentfrom 1906 on. Roncovieri was a traditionalist who believed that the function ofschools was to teach the basics, and that teaching children about sex andmorality should be the function of home and church. Hence, when the drive forsex hygiene courses in the public schools got under way, Roncovieri consultedwith mothers’ clubs and, in consequence, kept the program out of the schools.By 1908, upper-class progressives launched a decade-long movement to oustRoncovieri and transform the nature of the San Francisco public school system.Instead of an elected superintendent responding to a school board elected bydistricts, the progressives wanted an all-powerful school superintendent,appointed by a rubber-stamp board that in turn would be appointed by the mayor.In other words, in the name of “taking the schools out of politics,” they hopedto aggrandize the educational bureaucracy and maintain its power virtuallyunchecked by any popular or democratic control. The purpose was threefold: topush through the progressive program of social control, to impose upper-classcontrol over a working-class population, and to impose pietist Protestantcontrol over Catholic ethnics.[12] [part0017.html#fn12]The ethnoreligious struggle over the public schools in San Francisco was nothingnew; it had been going on tumultuously since the middle of the nineteenthcentury.[13] [part0017.html#fn13] In the last half of the nineteenth century,San Francisco was split into two parts. Ruling the city was a power elite ofnative-born old Americans, hailing from New England, including lawyers,businessmen, and pietist Protestant ministers. These comprised successively theWhig, Know-Nothing, Populist, and Republican parties in the city. On the otherhand were the foreign-born, largely Catholic immigrants from Europe—Irish,Germans, French, and Italians—who comprised the Democratic Party.The Protestants early tried to use the public schools as a homogenizing andcontrolling force. The great theoretician and founder of the public schoolsystem in San Francisco, John Swett, “the Horace Mann of California,” was alifelong Republican and a Yankee who had taught school in New Hampshire beforemoving West. Moreover, the Board of Education was originally an all-New Englandshow, consisting of emigrants from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. Themayor of San Francisco was a former mayor of Salem, Massachusetts, and everyadministrator and teacher in the public schools was a transplanted NewEnglander. The first superintendent of schools was not exactly a New Englander,but close: Thomas J. Nevins, a Yankee Whig lawyer from New York and an agent ofthe American Bible Society. And the first free public school in San Franciscowas instituted in the basement of a small Baptist chapel.Nevins, installed as superintendent of schools in 1851, promptly adopted therule of the New York City schools: Every teacher was compelled to begin each daywith a Protestant Bible reading and to conduct daily Protestant prayer sessions.And John Swett, elected as Republican state superintendent of public instructionduring the 1860s, declared that California needed public schools because of itsheterogeneous population: “Nothing can Americanize these chaotic elements, andbreathe into them the spirit of our institutions,” he warned, “except the publicschools.”[14] [part0017.html#fn14]Swett was keen enough to recognize that the pietist educational formula meantthat the state takes over jurisdiction of the child from his parents, since“children arrived at the age of maturity belong, not to the parents, but to theState, to society, to the country.”[15] [part0017.html#fn15]A seesaw struggle between the Protestant Yankees and Catholic ethnics ensued inSan Francisco during the 1850s. The state charter of San Francisco in 1855 madethe schools far more responsive to the people, with school boards being electedfrom each of a dozen wards instead of at large, and the superintendent electedby the people instead of appointed by the board. The Democrats swept theKnow-Nothings out of office in the city in 1856 and brought to power DavidBroderick, an Irish Catholic who controlled the San Francisco as well as theCalifornia Democratic Party. But this gain was wiped out by the San FranciscoVigilance Movement, a private organization of merchants and New England-bornYankees, who, attacking the “Tammany” tactics of Broderick, installed themselvesin power and illegally deported most of the Broderick organization, replacing itwith a newly formed People’s Party.The People’s Party ran San Francisco with an iron hand for ten years, from 1857to 1867, making secret nominations for appointments and driving through hugeslates of at-large nominees chosen by a single vote at a public meeting. No opennomination procedures, primaries, or ward divisions were allowed, in order toensure election victories by “reputable” men. The People’s Party promptlyreinstalled an all-Yankee school board, and the administrators and teachers inschools were again firmly Protestant and militantly anti-Catholic. The People’sParty itself continually attacked the Irish, denouncing them as “micks” and“rank Pats.” George Tait, the People’s Party-installed superintendent of schoolsin the 1860s, lamented, however, that some teachers were failing to read theProtestant Bible in the schools, and were thus casting “a slur on the religionand character of the community.”By the 1870s, however, the foreign-born residents outnumbered the native-born,and the Democratic Party rose to power in San Francisco, the People’s Partydeclining and joining the Republicans. The Board of Education ended the practiceof Protestant devotions in the schools, and Irish and Germans began to pour intoadministrative and teaching posts in the public school system.Another rollback began, however, in 1874, when the Republican state legislatureabolished ward elections for the San Francisco school board, and insisted thatall board members be elected at large. This meant that only the wealthy, whichusually meant well-to-do Protestants, were likely to be able to run successfullyfor election. Accordingly, whereas in 1873, 58% of the San Francisco schoolboard was foreign-born, the percentage was down to 8% in the following year. Andwhile the Irish were approximately 25% of the electorate and the Germans about13%, the Irish were not able to fill more than one or two of the 12 at-largeseats, and the Germans virtually none.The seesaw continued, however, as the Democrats came back in 1883, under theaegis of the master politician, the Irish Catholic Christopher “Blind Boss”Buckley. In the Buckley regime, the post-1874 school board dominated totally bywealthy native-born, Yankee businessmen and professionals, was replaced by anethnically balanced ticket with a high proportion of working-class andforeign-born. Furthermore, a high proportion of Irish Catholic teachers, most ofthem single women, entered the San Francisco schools during the Buckley era,reaching 50% by the turn of the century.In the late 1880s, however, the stridently anti-Catholic and anti-Irish AmericanParty became strong in San Francisco and the rest of the state, and Republicanleaders were happy to join them in denouncing the “immigrant peril.” TheAmerican Party managed to oust the Irish Catholic Joseph O’Connor, principal anddeputy superintendent, from his high post as “religiously unacceptable.” Thisvictory heralded a progressive Republican “reform” comeback in 1891, when noneother than John Swett was installed as superintendent of schools in SanFrancisco. Swett battled for the full reform program: to make everything, eventhe mayoralty, an appointive rather than an elective office. Part of the goalwas achieved by the state’s new San Francisco charter in 1900, which replacedthe 12-man elected Board of Education by a four-member board appointed by themayor.The full goal of total appointment was still blocked, however, by the existenceof an elective superintendent of schools who, since 1906, was the popularCatholic Alfred Roncovieri. The pietist progressives were also thwarted for twodecades by the fact that San Francisco was ruled, for most of the years between1901 and 1911, by a new Union Labor Party, which won on an ethnically andoccupationally balanced ticket, and which elected the German-Irish CatholicEugene Schmitz, a member of the musician’s union, as mayor. And for eighteenyears after 1911, San Francisco was governed by its most popular mayor before orsince, “Sunny Jim” Rolph, an Episcopalian friendly to Catholics and ethnics, whowas pro-Roncovieri and who presided over an ethnically pluralistic regime.It is instructive to examine the makeup of the progressive reform movement thateventually got its way and overthrew Roncovieri. It consisted of the standardprogressive coalition of business and professional elites, and nativist andanti-Catholic organizations, who called for the purging of Catholics from theschools. Particular inspiration came from Stanford educationist Ellwood P.Cubberley, who energized the California branch of the Association of CollegiateAlumnae (later the American Association of University Women), led by the wealthyMrs. Jesse H. Steinhart, whose husband was later to be a leader in theProgressive Party. Mrs. Steinhart got Mrs. Agnes De Lima, a New York Cityprogressive educator, to make a survey of the San Francisco schools for theassociation. The report, presented in 1914, made the expected case for an“efficient,” business-like, school system run solely by appointed educators.Mrs. Steinhart also organized the Public Education Society of San Francisco toagitate for progressive school reform; in this she was aided by the SanFrancisco Chamber of Commerce.Also backing progressive reform, and anxious to oust Roncovieri, were otherelite groups in the city, including the League of Women Voters, and theprestigious Commonwealth Club of California.At the behest of Mrs. Steinhart and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, whichcontributed the funds, Philander Claxton of the U.S. Office of Education weighedin with his report in December 1917. The report, which endorsed the Associationof Collegiate Alumnae study and was extremely critical of the San Franciscoschool system, called for all power over the system to go to an appointedsuperintendent of schools. Claxton also attacked the teaching of foreignlanguages in the schools, which San Francisco had been doing, and insisted on acomprehensive “Americanization” to break down ethnic settlements.The Claxton Report was the signal for the Chamber of Commerce to swing intoaction, and it proceeded to draft a comprehensive progressive referendum for theNovember 1918 ballot, calling for an appointed superintendent and an appointedschool board. This initiative, Amendment 37, was backed by most of the prominentbusiness and professional groups in the city. In addition to the ones namedabove, there were the Real Estate Board, elite women’s organizations such as theFederation of Women’s Clubs, wealthy neighborhood improvement clubs, and the SanFrancisco Examiner. Amendment 37 lost, however, by two to one, since it hadlittle support in working-class neighborhoods or among the teachers.Two years later, however, Amendment 37 passed, aided by a resurgence of pietismand virulent anti-Catholicism in postwar America. Prohibition was nowtriumphant, and the Ku Klux Klan experienced a nationwide revival as a pietist,anti-Catholic organization. The KKK had as many as 3,500 members in the SanFrancisco Bay Area in the early 1920s. The anti-Catholic American ProtectiveAssociation also enjoyed a revival, led in California by a British smallbusinessman, the anti-Irish Grand Master Colonel J. Arthur Petersen.In opposing Amendment 37 in the 1920 elections, Father Peter C. Yorke, aprominent priest and Irish immigrant, perceptively summed up the fundamentalcleavage: “The modern school system,” he declared, “is not satisfied withteaching children the 3 Rs... it reaches out and takes possession of their wholelives.”Amendment 37 passed in 1920 by the narrow margin of 69,200 to 66,700. It passedin every middle- and upper-class Assembly District, and lost in everyworking-class district. The higher the concentration of foreign-born voters inany district, the greater the vote against. In the Italian precincts 1 to 17 ofthe 33rd A.D., the Amendment was beaten by 3 to 1; in the Irish precincts, itwas defeated by 3 to 1 as well. The more Protestant a working-class district,the more it supported the Amendment.The bulk of the lobbying for the Amendment was performed by the ad hocEducational Conference. After the victory, the conference happily presented alist of nominees to the school board, which now consisted of seven membersappointed by the mayor, and which in turn appointed the superintendent. Theproposed board consisted entirely of businessmen, of whom only one was aconservative Irish Catholic. The mayor surrendered to the pressure, and hence,after 1921, cultural pluralism in the San Francisco school system gave way tounitary progressive rule. The board began by threatening to dock any teacher whodared to be absent from school on St. Patrick’s Day (a San Francisco traditionsince the 1870s), and proceeded to override the wishes of particularneighborhoods in the interest of a centralized city.The superintendent of schools in the new regime, Dr. Joseph Marr Gwinn, fit thenew dispensation to a tee. A professional “scientist” of public administration,his avowed aim was unitary control. The entire package of typical progressiveeducational nostrums was installed, including a department of education andvarious experimental programs. Traditional basic education was scorned, and theedict came down that children should not be “forced” to learn the 3 Rs if theydidn’t feel the need. Traditional teachers, who were continually attacked forbeing old-fashioned and “unprofessional,” were not promoted.Despite continued opposition by teachers, parents, neighborhoods, ethnic groups,and the ousted Roncovieri, all attempts to repeal Amendment 37 wereunsuccessful. The modern dispensation of progressivism had conquered SanFrancisco. The removal of the Board of Education and school superintendent fromdirect and periodic control by the electorate had effectively deprived parentsof any significant control over the educational policies of public schools. Atlast, as John Swett had asserted nearly 60 years earlier, schoolchildrenbelonged “not to the parents, but to the State, to society, to the country.”3. ETHNORELIGIOUS CONFLICT AND THE RISE OF FEMINISMA. WOMEN’S SUFFRAGEBy the 1890s, the liturgically oriented Democracy was slowly but surely winningthe national battle of the political parties. Culminating the battle was theDemocratic congressional victory in 1890 and the Grover Cleveland landslide inthe presidential election of 1892, in which Cleveland carried both Houses ofCongress along with him (an unusual feat for that era). The Democrats were inway of becoming the majority party of the country, and the root was demographic:the fact that most of the immigrants were Catholic and the Catholic birthratewas higher than that of the pietist Protestants. Even though British andScandinavian immigration had reached new highs during the 1880s, their numberswere far exceeded by German and Irish immigration, the latter being the highestsince the famous post-potato-famine influx that started in the late 1840s.Furthermore, the “new immigration” from southern and eastern Europe, almost allCatholic—and especially Italian—began to make its mark during the same decade.The pietists became increasingly embittered, stepping up their attacks onforeigners in general and Catholics in particular. Thus, the Reverend T.W.Cuyler, president of the National Temperance Society, intemperately exclaimed inthe summer of 1891: “How much longer [will] the Republic ... consent to have hersoil a dumping ground for all Hungarian ruffians, Bohemian bruisers, and Italiancutthroats of every description?”The first concrete political response by the pietists to the rising Catholictide was to try to restrict immigration. Republicans successfully managed topass laws partially cutting immigration, but President Cleveland vetoed a billto impose a literacy test on all immigrants. The Republicans also managed tocurtail voting by immigrants, by getting most states to disallow voting byaliens, thereby reversing the traditional custom of allowing alien voting. Theyalso urged the lengthening of the statutory waiting period for naturalization.The successful restricting of immigration and of immigrant voting was still notenough to matter, and immigration would not really be foreclosed until the1920s. But if voting could not be restricted sharply enough, perhaps it could beexpanded—in the proper pietist direction.Specifically, it was clear to the pietists that the role of women in theliturgical “ethnic” family was very different from what it was in the pietistProtestant family. One of the reasons impelling pietists and Republicans towardprohibition was the fact that, culturally, the lives of urban male Catholics—andthe cities of the Northeast were becoming increasingly Catholic—evolved aroundthe neighborhood saloon. The men would repair at night to the saloon forchitchat, discussions, and argument—and they would generally take theirpolitical views from the saloonkeeper, who thus became the political powerhousein his particular ward. Therefore, prohibition meant breaking the politicalpower of the urban liturgical machines in the Democratic Party.But while the social lives of liturgical males revolved around the saloon, theirwives stayed at home. While pietist women were increasingly independent andpolitically active, the lives of liturgical women revolved solely about home andhearth. Politics was strictly an avocation for husbands and sons. Perceivingthis, the pietists began to push for women’s suffrage, realizing that far morepietist than liturgical women would take advantage of the power to vote.As a result, the women’s suffrage movement was heavily pietist from the verybeginning. Ultrapietist third parties like the Greenback and the Prohibitionparties, which scorned the Republicans for being untrustworthy moderates onsocial issues, supported women’s suffrage throughout, and the Populists tendedin that direction. The Progressive Party of 1912 was strongly in favor ofwomen’s suffrage; theirs was the first major national convention to permit womendelegates. The first woman elector, Helen J. Scott of Wisconsin, was chosen bythe Progressive Party.Perhaps the major single organization in the women’s suffrage movement was theWomen’s Christian Temperance Union, founded in 1874 and reaching an enormousmembership of 300,000 by 1900. That the W.C.T.U. was also involved in agitatingfor curfew, antigambling, antismoking, and antisex laws—all actions lauded bythe women’s suffrage movement—is clear from the official history of women’ssuffrage in the 19th century:> [The W.C.T.U.] has been a chief factor in State campaigns for statutory> prohibition, constitutional amendment, reform laws in general and those for> the protection of women and children in particular, and in securing> anti-gambling and anti-cigarette laws.

The association [W.C.T.U.] protests against the> legalization of all crimes, especially those of prostitution and liquor> selling.[16] [part0017.html#fn16]Not only did Susan B. Anthony begin her career as a professional prohibitionist,but her two successors as president of the leading women’s suffrageorganization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association—Mrs. CarrieChapman Catt and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw—also began their professional careers asprohibitionists. The leading spirit of the W.C.T.U., Frances E. Willard, wasprototypically born of New England-stock parents who had moved westward to studyat Oberlin College, then the nation’s center of aggressive, evangelical pietism,and had later settled in Wisconsin. Guided by Miss Willard, the W.C.T.U. beganits prosuffrage activities by demanding that women vote in local optionreferendums on prohibition. As Miss Willard put it, the W.C.T.U. wanted women tovote on this issue because “majorities of women are against the liquortraffic ...”[17] [part0017.html#fn17]Conversely, whenever there was a voters’ referendum on women’s suffrage, theliturgicals and the foreign-born, responding to immigrant culture and reactingagainst the pietist-feminist support of prohibition, consistently opposedwomen’s suffrage. In Iowa, the Germans voted against women’s suffrage, as didthe Chinese in California. The women’s suffrage amendment in 1896 in Californiawas heavily supported by the bitterly anti-Catholic American ProtectiveAssociation. The cities, where Catholics abounded, tended to be opposed towomen’s suffrage, while pietist rural areas tended to favor it. Thus, the Oregonreferendum of 1900 lost largely because of opposition in the Catholic “slums” ofPortland and Astoria.A revealing religious breakdown of votes on an 1877 women’s suffrage referendumwas presented in a report by a Colorado feminist. She explained that theMethodists (the most strongly pietistic) were “for us,” the (less pietistic)Presbyterians and Episcopalians “fairly so,” while the Roman Catholics “were notall against us”—clearly they were expected to be.[18] [part0017.html#fn18] And,testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of women’ssuffrage in 1880, Susan B. Anthony presented her own explanation of the Coloradovote:> In Colorado ... 6,666 men voted “Yes.” Now, I am going to describe the men who> voted “Yes.” They were native-born men, temperance men, cultivated, broad,> generous, just men, men who think. On the other hand, 16,007 voted “No.” Now,> I am going to describe that class of voters. In the southern part of that> State are Mexicans, who speak the Spanish language. ... The vast population of> Colorado is made up of that class of people. I was sent out to speak in a> voting precinct having 200 voters; 150 of those voters were Mexican greasers,> 40 of them foreign-born citizens, and just 10 of them were born in this> country; and I was supposed to be competent to convert those men to let me> have so much right in this Government as they had ...[19] [part0017.html#fn19]A laboratory test of which women would turn out to vote occurred inMassachusetts, where women were given the power to vote in school boardelections from 1879 on. In 1888, large numbers of Protestant women in Bostonturned out to drive Catholics off the school board. In contrast, Catholic womenscarcely voted, “thereby validating the nativist tendencies of suffragists whobelieved that extension of full suffrage to women would provide a barrieragainst further Catholic influence.”[20] [part0017.html#fn20] During the lasttwo decades of the 19th century “the more hierarchical the church organizationand the more formal the ritual, the greater was its opposition to womensuffrage, while the democratically organized churches with little dogma tendedto be more receptive.”[21] [part0017.html#fn21]Four mountain states adopted women’s suffrage in the early and mid-1890s. Two,Wyoming and Utah, were simply ratifying, as new states, a practice they had longadopted as territories: Wyoming in 1869 and Utah in 1870. Utah had adoptedwomen’s suffrage as a conscious policy by the pietistic Mormons to weightpolitical control in favor of their polygamous members, who contrasted to theGentiles, largely miners and settlers who were either single men or who had lefttheir wives back East. Wyoming had adopted women’s suffrage in an effort toincrease the political power of its settled householders, in contrast to thetransient, mobile, and often lawless single men who peopled that frontierregion.No sooner had Wyoming Territory adopted women’s suffrage than it became evidentthat the change had benefited the Republicans, particularly since women hadmobilized against Democratic attempts to repeal Wyoming’s Sunday prohibitionlaw. In 1871, both houses of the Wyoming legislature, led by its Democraticmembers, voted to repeal women’s suffrage, but the bill was vetoed by theRepublican territorial governor.Two additional states adopting women’s suffrage in the 1890s were Idaho andColorado. In Idaho the drive, adopted by referendum in 1896, was led by theultrapietistic Populists and by the Mormons, who were dominant in the southernpart of the state. The Populist counties of Colorado gave a majority of 6,800for women’s suffrage, while the Republican and Democratic counties voted amajority of 500 against.[22] [part0017.html#fn22]It may be thought paradoxical that a movement—women’s suffrage—born and centeredin the East should have had its earliest victories in the remote frontier statesof the Mountain West. But the paradox begins to clear when we realize thepietist-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant nature of the frontiersmen, many of them Yankeeshailing originally from that birthplace of American pietism, New England. As thehistorian Frederick Jackson Turner, that great celebrant of frontier ideals,lyrically observed:> In the arid West these pioneers [from New England] have halted and have turned> to perceive an altered nation and changed social ideals. ... If we follow back> the line of march of the Puritan farmer, we shall see how responsive he has> always been to isms. ... He is the Prohibitionist of Iowa and Wisconsin,> crying out against German customs as an invasion of his traditional ideals. He> is the Granger of Wisconsin, passing restrictive railroad legislation. He is> the Abolitionist, the Anti-mason, the Millerite, the Woman Suffragist, the> Spiritualist, the Mormon, of Western New York.[23] [part0017.html#fn23]B. EUGENICS AND BIRTH CONTROLThus the women’s suffrage movement, dominated by pietist progressives, was notdirected solely to achieving some abstract principle of electoral equalitybetween males and females. This was more a means to another end: the creation ofelectoral majorities for pietist measures of direct social control over thelives of American families. They wished to determine by state intervention whatthose families drank and when and where they drank, how they spent their Sabbathday, and how their children should be educated.One way of correcting the increasingly pro-Catholic demographics was to restrictimmigration; another to promote women’s suffrage. A third way, often promoted inthe name of “science,” was eugenics, an increasingly popular doctrine of theprogressive movement. Broadly, eugenics may be defined as encouraging thebreeding of the “fit” and discouraging the breeding of the “unfit,” the criteriaof “fitness” often coinciding with the cleavage between native, whiteProtestants and the foreign born or Catholics—or the white-black cleavage. Inextreme cases, the unfit were to be coercively sterilized.To the founder of the American eugenics movement, the distinguished biologistCharles Benedict Davenport, a New Yorker of eminent New England background, therising feminist movement was beneficent provided that the number of biologicallysuperior persons was sustained and the number of the unfit diminished. Thebiologist Harry H. Laughlin, aide to Davenport, associate editor of theEugenical News, and highly influential in the immigration restriction policy ofthe 1920s as eugenics expert for the House Committee on Immigration andNaturalization, stressed the great importance of cutting the immigration of thebiologically “inferior” southern Europeans. For in that way, the biologicalsuperiority of Anglo-Saxon women would be protected.Harry Laughlin’s report to the House Committee, printed in 1923, helpedformulate the 1924 immigration law, which, in addition to drastically limitingtotal immigration to the United States, imposed national origin quotas based onthe 1910 census, so as to weight the sources of immigration as much as possiblein favor of northern Europeans. Laughlin later emphasized that American womenmust keep the nation’s blood pure by not marrying what he called the “coloredraces,” in which he included southern Europeans as well as blacks: for if “menwith a small fraction of colored blood could readily find mates among the whitewomen, the gates would be thrown open to a final radical race mixture of thewhole population.” To Laughlin the moral was clear: “The perpetuity of theAmerican race and consequently of American institutions depends upon the virtueand fecundity of American women.”[24] [part0017.html#fn24]But the problem was that the fecund women were not the pietist progressives butthe Catholics. For, in addition to immigration, another source of demographicalarm to the pietists was the far higher birthrate among Catholic women. If onlythey could be induced to adopt birth control! Hence, the birth control movementbecame part of the pietist armamentarium in their systemic struggle with theCatholics and other liturgicals.Thus, the distinguished University of California eugenicist, Samuel J. Holmes,lamented that “the trouble with birth control is that it is practiced leastwhere it should be practiced most.” In the Birth Control Review, leading organof the birth control movement, Annie G. Porritt was more specific, attacking“the folly of closing our gates to aliens from abroad, while having them wideopen to the overwhelming progeny of the least desirable elements of our city andslum population.”[25] [part0017.html#fn25] In short, the birth controllers weresaying that if one’s goal is to restrict sharply the total number of Catholics,“colored” southern European or no, then there is no point in only limitingimmigration while the domestic population continues to increase.The birth control and the eugenics movement therefore went hand in hand, not theleast in the views of the well-known leader of the birth control movement in theUnited States: Mrs. Margaret Higgins Sanger, prolific author, founder, andlong-time editor of the Birth Control Review. Echoing many of the variousstrains of progressivism, Mrs. Sanger hailed the emancipation of women throughbirth control as the latest in applied science and “efficiency.” As she put itin her Autobiography:> In an age which has developed science and industry and economic efficiency to> their highest points, so little thought has been given to the development of a> science of parenthood, a science of maternity which could prevent this> appalling and unestimated waste of womankind and maternal effort.[26]> [part0017.html#fn26]To Mrs. Sanger, “science” also meant stopping the breeding of the unfit. Adevoted eugenicist and follower of C.B. Davenport, she in fact chided theeugenics movement for not sufficiently emphasizing this crucial point:> The eugenists wanted to shift the birth control emphasis from less children> for the poor to more children for the rich. We went back of that and sought> first to stop the multiplication of the unfit. This appeared the most> important and greatest step toward race betterment.[27] [part0017.html#fn27]4. GATHERED TOGETHER: PROGRESSIVISM AS A POLITICAL PARTYProgressivism was, to a great extent, the culmination of the pietist Protestantpolitical impulse, the urge to regulate every aspect of American life, economicand moral—even the most intimate and crucial aspects of family life. But it wasalso a curious alliance of a technocratic drive for government regulation, thesupposed expression of “value-free science,” and the pietist religious impulseto save America—and the world—by state coercion. Often both pietistic andscientific arguments would be used, sometimes by the same people, to achieve theold pietist goals. Thus, prohibition would be argued for on religious as well ason alleged scientific or medicinal grounds. In many cases, leading progressiveintellectuals at the turn of the 20th century were former pietists who went tocollege and then transferred to the political arena, their zeal for making overmankind, as a “salvation by science.” And then the Social Gospel movementmanaged to combine political collectivism and pietist Christianity in the samepackage. All of these were strongly interwoven elements in the progressivemovement.All these trends reached their apogee in the Progressive Party and its nationalconvention of 1912. The assemblage was a gathering of businessmen,intellectuals, academics, technocrats, efficiency experts and social engineers,writers, economists, social scientists, and leading representatives of the newprofession of social work. The Progressive leaders were middle and upper class,almost all urban, highly educated, and almost all white Anglo-Saxon Protestantsof either past or present pietist concerns.From the social work leaders came upper-class ladies bringing the blessings ofstatism to the masses: Lillian D. Wald, Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, and aboveall, Jane Addams. Miss Addams, one of the great leaders of progressivism, wasborn in rural Illinois to a father, John, who was a state legislator and adevout nondenominational evangelical Protestant. Miss Addams was distressed atthe southern and eastern European immigration, people who were “primitive” and“credulous,” and who posed the danger of unrestrained individualism. Theirdifferent ethnic background disrupted the unity of American culture. However,the problem, according to Miss Addams, could be easily remedied. The publicschool could reshape the immigrant, strip him of his cultural foundations, andtransform him into a building block of a new and greater American community.[28][part0017.html#fn28]In addition to writers and professional technocrats at the Progressive Partyconvention, there were professional pietists galore. Social Gospel leaders LymanAbbott, the Reverend R. Heber Newton, and the Reverend Washington Gladden wereProgressive Party notables, and the Progressive candidate for governor ofVermont was the Reverend Fraser Metzger, leader of the Inter-Church Federationof Vermont. In fact, the Progressive Party proclaimed itself as the“recrudescence of the religious spirit in American political life.”Many observers, indeed, reported in wonder at the strongly religious tone of theProgressive Party convention. Theodore Roosevelt’s acceptance address wassignificantly entitled, “A Confession of Faith,” and his words were punctuatedby “amens” and by a continual singing of Christian hymns by the assembleddelegates. They sang “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” “The Battle Hymn of theRepublic,” and finally the revivalist hymn, “Follow, Follow, We Will FollowJesus,” except that “Roosevelt” replaced the word “Jesus” at every turn.The New York Times of August 6, 1912, summed up the unusual experience bycalling the Progressive assemblage “a convention of fanatics.” And, “It was nota convention at all. It was an assemblage of religious enthusiasts. It was sucha convention as Peter the Hermit held. It was a Methodist camp following doneover into political terms.”[29] [part0017.html#fn29]Thus the foundations of today’s massive state intervention in the internal lifeof the American family were laid in the so-called “progressive era” from the1870s to the 1920s. Pietists and “progressives” united to control the materialand sexual choices of the rest of the American people, their drinking habits,and their recreational preferences. Their values, the very nurture and educationof their children, were to be determined by their betters. The spiritual,biological, political, intellectual, and moral elite would govern, through statepower, the character and quality of American family life.5. SIGNIFICANCEIt has been known for decades that the Progressive Era was marked by a radicalgrowth in the extension and dominance of government in America’s economic,social, and cultural life. For decades, this great leap into statism was naivelyinterpreted by historians as a simple response to the greater need for planningand regulation of an increasingly complex economy. In recent years, however,historians have come to see that increasing statism on a federal and state levelcan be better interpreted as a profitable alliance between certain business andindustrial interests, looking for government to cartelize their industry afterprivate efforts for cartels and monopoly had failed, and intellectuals,academics, and technocrats seeking jobs to help regulate and plan the economy aswell as restriction of entry into their professions. In short, the ProgressiveEra re-created the age-old alliance between Big Government, large businessfirms, and opinion-molding intellectuals—an alliance that had most recently beenembodied in the mercantilist system of the sixteenth through eighteenthcenturies.Other historians uncovered a similar process at the local level, especially thatof urban government beginning with the Progressive Era. Using the influence ofmedia and opinion leaders, upper-income and business groups in the citiessystematically took political power away from the masses and centralized thispower in the hands of urban government responsive to progressive demands.Elected officials, and decentralized ward representation, were systematicallyreplaced either by appointed bureaucrats and civil servants, or by centralizedat-large districts where large-scale funding was needed to finance electionraces. In this way, power was shifted out of the hands of the masses and intothe hands of a minority elite of technocrats and upper-income businessmen. Oneresult was an increase of government contracts to business, a shift from“Tammany” type charity by the political parties to a taxpayer-financed welfarestate, and the imposition of higher taxes on suburban residents to finance bondissues and redevelopment schemes accruing to downtown financial interests.During the last two decades, educational historians have described a similarprocess at work in public, especially urban, school systems. The scope of thepublic school was greatly expanded, compulsory attendance spread outside of NewEngland and other “Yankee” areas during the Progressive Era, and a powerfulmovement developed to try to ban private schools and to force everyone into thepublic school system.From the work of educational historians, it was clear that the leap intocomprehensive state control over the individual and over social life was notconfined, during the Progressive and indeed post-Progressive eras, to governmentand the economy. A far more comprehensive process was at work. The expansion ofcompulsory public schooling stemmed from the growth of collectivist andanti-individualist ideology among intellectuals and educationists. Theindividual, these “progressives” believed, must be molded by the educationalprocess to conform to the group, which in practice meant the dictates of thepower elite speaking in the group’s name. Historians have long been aware ofthis process.[30] [part0017.html#fn30] But the accruing insight intoprogressivism as a business cartelizing device led historians who had abandonedthe easy equation of “businessmen” with “laissez-faire” to see that all thefacets of progressivism—the economic and the ideological and educational—werepart of an integrated whole. The new ideology among business groups wascartelist and collectivist rather than individualist and laissez-faire, and thesocial control over the individual exerted by progressivism was neatlyparalleled in the ideology and practice of progressive education. Anotherparallel to the economic realm, of course, was the increased power and incomeaccruing to the technocratic intellectuals controlling the school system and theeconomy.If the action of business and intellectual elites in turning towardprogressivism was now explained, there was still a large gap in the historicalexplanation and understanding of progressivism and therefore of the leap intostatism beginning in the early 20th century. There was still a need to explainmass voting behavior and the ideology and programs of the political parties inthe American electoral system. This chapter applies the illuminating findings ofrecent “ethnoreligious historians” to significant changes that took place duringthe Progressive Era in the power of government over the family. In particular,we discuss the movement to expand the power of the public school and theeducationist elite over the family, as well as the women’s suffrage and eugenicsmovement, all important features of the Progressive movement. In every case, wesee the vital link between these intrusions into the family and the aggressivedrive by Anglo-Saxon Protestant “pietists” to use the state to “make Americaholy,” to stamp out sin and thereby assure their own salvation by maximizing thesalvation of others. In particular, all of these measures were part and parcelof the long-standing crusade by these pietists to reduce if not eliminate therole of “liturgicals,” largely Roman Catholics and high-church Lutherans, fromAmerican political life. The drive to stamp out liquor and secular activities onSundays had long run into successful Catholic and high-church Lutheranresistance. Compulsory public schooling was soon seen as an indispensable weaponin the task of “Christianizing the Catholics,” of saving the souls of Catholicchildren by using the public schools as a Protestantizing weapon. The neglectedexample of San Francisco politics was urged as a case study of thisethnoreligious political battle over the schools and hence over the right ofCatholic parents to transmit their own values to their children withoutsuffering Anglo-Saxon Protestant obstruction. Women’s suffrage was seized uponas a means of increasing Anglo-Saxon Protestant voting power, and immigrationrestriction as well as eugenics was a method of reducing the growing demographicchallenge of Catholic voters.In sum, recent insights into the cartelizing drive of various business interestshave provided an important explanation of the rapid growth of statism in the20th century. Ethnoreligious history provides an explanation of mass votingbehavior and political party programs that neatly complement the cartelizingexplanation of the actions of business elites.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in The American Family and the State, Joseph R.

Inshort, whereas Catholics, Lutherans, and most Calvinists believed that thereturn of Jesus is independent of human actions, the postmillennialists heldthat Christians must establish a thousand-year reign of the Kingdom of God onearth as a necessary precondition of Jesus’s return.

The analogy restson the market economy: demand gives rise to supply (e.g., a demand for creamcheese will result in a supply of cream cheese on the market). But surely it isstrained to say that, in the same way, a demand for postal services willspontaneously give rise to a government monopoly Post Office, outlawing itscompetition and giving us ever-poorer service for ever-higher prices.Indeed, if the analogy fails when even a genuine service (e.g., mail delivery orroad construction) is being provided, imagine how much worse the analogy is whengovernment is not supplying a good or service at all, but is coercivelyredistributing income and wealth.When the government, in short, takes money at gun point from A and gives it toB, who is demanding what? The cream cheese producer on the market is using hisresources to supply a genuine demand for cream cheese; he is not engaged incoercive redistribution. But what about the government’s taking from A andgiving the money to B? Who are the demanders, and who are the suppliers? One cansay that the subsidized, the “donees,” are “demanding” this redistribution;surely, however, it would be straining credulity to claim that A, the fleeced,is also “demanding” this activity. A, in fact, is the reluctant supplier, thecoerced donor; B is gaining at A’s expense. But the really interesting role hereis played by G, the government. For apart from the unlikely case where G is anunpaid altruist, performing this action as an uncompensated Robin Hood, G gets arake-off, a handling charge, a finder’s fee, so to speak, for this littletransaction. G, the government, in other words, performs his act of“redistribution” by fleecing A for the benefit of B and of himself.Once we focus on this aspect of the transaction, we begin to realize that G, thegovernment, might not just be a passive recipient of B’s felt need and economicdemand, as standard theory would have it; instead, G himself might be an activedemander and, as a full-time, paid Robin Hood, might even have stimulated B’sdemand in the first place, so as to be in on the deal. The felt need, then,might be on the part of the governmental Robin Hood himself.1. WHY THE WELFARE STATE?Why has government increased greatly over this century? Specifically, why hasthe welfare state appeared, grown, and become ever-larger and more powerful?What was the functional need felt here? One answer is that the development ofpoverty over the past century gave rise to welfare and redistribution. But thismakes little sense, since it is evident that the average person’s standard ofliving has grown considerably over the past century-and-a-half, and poverty hasgreatly diminished.But perhaps inequality has been aggravated, and the masses, even though betteroff, are upset by the increased income gap between themselves and the wealthy?English translation: the masses may be smitten with envy and rankle furiously ata growing income disparity. But it should also be evident from one glance at theThird World that the disparity of income and wealth between the rich and themasses is far greater there than in Western capitalist countries. So what’s theproblem?Another standard answer more plausibly asserts that industrialization andurbanization, by the late 19th century, deprived the masses, uprooted from thesoil or the small town, of their sense of community, belonging, and mutualaid.[1] [part0018.html#fn1] Alienated and deracinated in the city and in thefactory, the masses reached out for the welfare state to take the place of theirold community.Certainly it is true that the welfare state emerged during the same period asindustrialization and urbanization, but coincidence does not establishcausation.One grave flaw in this urbanization theory is that it ignores the actual natureof the city, at least as it had been before it was effectively destroyed in thedecades after World War II. The city was not a monolithic agglomeration but aseries of local neighborhoods, each with its own distinctive character, networkof clubs, fraternal associations, and street corner hangouts. Jane Jacobs’smemorable depiction of the urban neighborhood in her Death and Life of GreatAmerican Cities was a charming and accurate portrayal of the unity in diversityof each neighborhood, of the benign role of the “street watcher” and the localstorekeeper. Large city life in the United States by 1900 was almost exclusivelyCatholic and ethnic, and both the political and social life of Catholic males ineach neighborhood revolved, and still, to an extent, revolves, around theneighborhood saloon. There the men of the neighborhood would repair each eveningto the saloon, where they would drink a few beers, socialize, and discusspolitics. Typically, they would receive political instruction from the localsaloonkeeper, who was generally also the local Democratic ward heeler. Wivessocialized separately, and at home. The beloved community was still alive andwell in urban America.On deeper historical inquiry, moreover, this seemingly plausible industrialismexplanation falls apart, and not only on the familiar problem of Americanexceptionalism, the fact that the United States, despite industrializing morerapidly, lagged behind European countries in developing the welfare state.Detailed investigations of a number of industrialized countries, for example,find no correlation whatsoever between the degree of industrialization and theadoption of social insurance programs between the 1880s and the 1920s or the1960s.[2] [part0018.html#fn2]More strikingly, the same findings hold true within the United States, whereAmerican exceptionalism can play no role. The earliest massive social welfareprogram in the United States was the dispensing of post-Civil War pensions toaging veterans of the Union Army and their dependents. Yet, these post-Civil Warpensions were more likely to aid farmers and small townsmen than residents oflarge industrial cities. County level post-Civil War pension studies in Ohio inthe late 1880s, the peak years for these pension payments, demonstrate anegative correlation between the degree of urbanism, or percentage of peopleliving in homes rather than on farms, and the rates of receipt of pensions. Theauthor of the study concluded that “generally, pensions were distributed topredominantly rural, Anglo-Saxon areas,” while the major city of Cleveland hadthe lowest per capita rate of receipt of pensions.[3] [part0018.html#fn3]Furthermore, pioneers in unemployment insurance and other social legislationwere often the less-industrialized and more rural states, such as Wisconsin,Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Washington state.[4] [part0018.html#fn4]Another standard view, the left-liberal or “social democratic model,” as itspractitioners call it, holds that the welfare state came about not through thesemi-automatic functioning of industrialization, but rather through consciousmass movements from below, movements generated by the demands of the presumptivebeneficiaries of the welfare state themselves: the poor, the masses, or theoppressed working class. This thesis has been summed up boldly by one of itsadherents. Everywhere, he says, the welfare state has been the product of> a highly centralized trade union movement with a class-wide membership base,> operating in close coordination with a unified reformist-socialist party> which, primarily on the basis of massive working class support, is able to> achieve hegemonic status in the party system.[5] [part0018.html#fn5]Certainly, much of this thesis is overdrawn even for Europe, where much of thewelfare state was brought about by conservative and liberal bureaucrats andpolitical parties, rather than by unions or socialist parties. But setting thataside and concentrating on the United States, there has been, for one thing, nomassively supported socialist party, let along one which has managed to achieve“hegemonic status.”We are left, then, with labor unions as the only possible support for thesocial-democratic model for the United States. But here, historians, almostuniformly starry-eyed supporters of labor unions, have wildly exaggerated theimportance of unions in American history. When we get past romantic stories ofstrikes and industrial conflicts (in which the union role is inevitablywhitewashed if not glorified), even the best economic historians don’t botherinforming the reader of the meager quantitative role or importance of unions inthe American economy. Indeed, until the New Deal, and with the exception ofbrief periods when unionization was coercively imposed by the federal government(during World War I, and in the railroads during the 1920s), the percentage ofunion members in the labor force typically ranged from a minuscule 1% to 2%during recessions, up to 5% or 6% during inflationary booms, and then down tothe negligible figure in the next recession.[6] [part0018.html#fn6]Furthermore, in boom or bust, labor unions, in the free-market environment, wereonly able to take hold in specific occupations and areas of the economy.Specifically, unions could only flourish as skilled-craft unions (a) which couldcontrol the supply of labor in the occupation because of the small number ofworkers involved, (b) where this limited number constituted a small fraction ofthe employer’s payroll, and (c) where, because of technological factors, theindustry in question was not very actively competitive across geographicalregions. One way to sum up these factors is to say, in economists’ jargon, thatthe employers’ demand schedule for this type of labor is inelastic—that is, thata small restriction in the supply of such labor could give rise to a large wageincrease for the remaining workers. Labor unions could flourish, moreover, insuch geographically uncompetitive industries as anthracite coal, which is foundin only a small area of northeastern Pennsylvania; and the various buildingtrades (carpenters, masons, electricians, joiners, etc.), since buildingconstruction in, say, New York City, is only remotely competitive with similarconstruction in Chicago or Duluth. In contrast, despite determined efforts, itwas impossible for unions to prosper in such industries as bituminous coal,which is found in large areas of the United States, or clothing manufacture,where factories can move readily to another, non-unionized area.It was a shrewd understanding of these principles that enabled Samuel Gompersand the craft unions in his American Federation of Labor to flourish, whileother, more radical and socialistic unions, such as The Noble Order of theKnights of Labor, collapsed quickly and faded from the scene.[7][part0018.html#fn7]It should be obvious, then, that the advent and growth of the welfare state inthe United States had little or nothing to do with the growth of the labormovement. On the contrary, the growth of labor unionism in America—during WorldWar I and during the 1930s, its two great spurts of activity—were brought aboutby governmental coercion from above. Labor unions, then, were an effect ratherthan a cause of the welfare state, at least in the United States.2. YANKEE POSTMILLENNIAL PIETISMIf it wasn’t industrialism or mass movements of the working class that broughtthe welfare state to America, what was it? Where are we to look for the causalforces? In the first place, we must realize that the two most powerfulmotivations in human history have always been ideology (including religiousdoctrine), and economic interest, and that a joining of these two motivationscan be downright irresistible. It was these two forces that joined powerfullytogether to bring about the welfare state.Ideology was propelled by an intensely held religious doctrine that swept overand controlled virtually all Protestant churches, especially in “Yankee” areasof the North, from 1830 on. Likewise, a growing corollary ideology of statismand corporate socialism spread among intellectuals and ministers by the end ofthe 19th century. Among the economic interests promoted by the burgeoningwelfare state were two in particular. One was a growing legion of educated (andoften overeducated) intellectuals, technocrats, and the “helping professions”who sought power, prestige, subsidies, contracts, cushy jobs from the welfarestate, and restrictions of entry into their field via forms of licensing. Thesecond was groups of big businessmen who, after failing to achieve monopolypower on the free market, turned to government—local, state, and federal—to gainit for them. The government would provide subsidies, contracts, and,particularly, enforced cartelization. After 1900, these two groups coalesced,combining two crucial elements: wealth and opinion-molding power, the latter nolonger hampered by the resistance of a Democratic Party committed tolaissez-faire ideology. The new coalition joined together to create andaccelerate a welfare state in America. Not only was this true in 1900, itremains true today.Perhaps the most fateful of the events giving rise to and shaping the welfarestate was the transformation of American Protestantism that took place in aremarkably brief period during the late 1820s. Riding in on a wave from Europe,fueled by an intense emotionalism often generated by revival meetings, thisSecond Great Awakening conquered and remolded the Protestant churches, leavingsuch older forms as Calvinism far behind. The new Protestantism was spearheadedby the emotionalism of revival meetings held throughout the country by the Rev.Charles Grandison Finney. This new Protestantism was pietist, scorning liturgyas papist or formalistic, and equally scornful of the formalisms of Calvinistcreed or church organization. Hence, denominationalism, God’s Law, and churchorganization were no longer important. What counted was each person’s achievingsalvation by his own free will, by being “born again,” or being “baptized in theHoly Spirit.” An emotional, vaguely defined pietist, non-creeded, and ecumenicalProtestantism was to replace strict creedal or liturgical categories.The new pietism took different forms in various regions of the country. In theSouth, it became personalist, or salvational; the emphasis was on each personachieving this rebirth of salvation on his own, rather than via social orpolitical action. In the North, especially in Yankee areas, the form of the newProtestantism was very different. It was aggressively evangelical andpostmillennialist, that is, it became each believer’s sacred duty to devote hisenergies to trying to establish a Kingdom of God on Earth, to establishing theperfect society in America and eventually the world, to stamp out sin and “makeAmerica holy,” as essential preparation for the eventual Second Advent of JesusChrist. Each believer’s duty went far beyond mere support of missionaryactivity, for a crucial part of the new doctrine held that he who did not tryhis very best to maximize the salvation of others would not himself be saved.After only a few years of agitation, it was clear to these new Protestants thatthe Kingdom of God on Earth could only be established by government, which wasrequired to bolster the salvation of individuals by stamping out occasions forsin. While the list of sins was unusually extensive, the PMPs (postmillennialpietists) stressed in particular the suppression of Demon Rum, which cloudsmen’s minds to prevent them from achieving salvation, slavery which preventedthe enslaved from achieving such salvation, any activities on the Sabbath exceptpraying or reading the Bible and any activities of the Anti-Christ in theVatican, the Pope of Rome and his conscious and dedicated agents who constitutedthe Catholic Church.The Yankees who particularly embraced this view were an ethno-cultural groupdescending from the original Puritans of Massachusetts, and who, beginning inrural New England, moved westward and settled upstate New York (“the Burned-OverDistrict”), northern Ohio, northern Indiana, northern Illinois, and neighboringareas. As early as the Puritan days, the Yankees were eager to coerce themselvesand their neighbors; the first American public schools were set up in NewEngland to inculcate obedience and civic virtue in their charges.[8][part0018.html#fn8]The concentration of the new statists in Yankee areas was nothing short ofremarkable. From the Rev. Finney on down to virtually all the Progressiveintellectuals who would set the course of America in the years after 1900, theywere, almost to a man, born in Yankee areas: rural New England and their migrantdescendants in upstate and western New York, northeastern Ohio (the “WesternReserve,” originally owned by Connecticut and settled early by ConnecticutYankees), and the northern reaches of Indiana and Illinois. Almost to a man,they were raised in very strict Sabbatarian homes, and often their father was alay preacher and their mother the daughter of a preacher.[9] [part0018.html#fn9]It is very likely that the propensity of the Yankees, in particular, to take soquickly to the coercive, crusading aspect of the new Protestant pietism was aheritage of the values, mores, and world outlook of their Puritan ancestors, andof the community they had established in New England. Indeed, we have in recentyears been strikingly reminded of the three very different and clashing groups,all Protestants, who came from very different regions of Great Britain, and whosettled in different regions of North America: the coercive, community-orientedPuritans from East Anglia who settled in New England, themanor-and-plantation-oriented Anglian Cavaliers who came from Wessex and settledin the Tidewater South, and the feisty, individualistic Presbyterian Bordererswho came from the border country in northern England and southern Scotland andwho settled in the Southern and Western back country.[10] [part0018.html#fn10]The Rev. Charles Grandison Finney, who essentially launched the pietist sweep,was virtually a paradigmatic Yankee. He was born in Connecticut; at an earlyage, his father joined the emigration by taking his family to a western New Yorkfarm, on the Ontario frontier. In 1812, fully 2/3 of the 200,000 people livingin western New York had been born in New England. While a nominal Presbyterian,in 1821 at the age of 29, Finney converted to the new pietism, experiencing hissecond baptism, his “baptism of the Holy Spirit,” his conversion being greatlyaided by the fact that he was self-educated in religion and lacked any religioustraining. Tossing aside the Calvinist tradition of scholarship in the Bible,Finney was able to carve out his new religion and ordain himself in his newversion of the faith. Launching his remarkably successful revival movement in1826 when he was an attorney in northeastern Ohio, his new pietism swept theYankee areas in the East and Midwest. Finney wound up at Oberlin College, in theWestern Reserve area of Ohio, where he became president, and transformed Oberlininto the preeminent national center for the education and dissemination ofpostmillennial pietism.[11] [part0018.html#fn11]The pietists quickly took to statist paternalism at the local and state level:to try to stamp out Demon Rum, Sabbath activity, dancing, gambling, and otherforms of enjoyment, as well as trying to outlaw or cripple Catholic parochialschools and expand public schools as a device to Protestantize Catholicchildren, or, in the common phrase of the later 19th century, to “Christianizethe Catholics.” But use of the national government came early as well: to try torestrict Catholic immigration, in response to the Irish Catholic influx of thelate 1840s, to restrict or abolish slavery; or to eliminate the sin of maildelivery on Sunday. It was therefore easy for the new pietists to expand theirconsciousness to favor paternalism in national economic affairs. Using biggovernment to create a perfect economy seemed to parallel employing suchgovernment to stamp out sin and create a perfect society. Early on, the PMPsadvocated government intervention to aid business interests and to protectAmerican industry from the competition of foreign imports. In addition, theytended to advocate public works and government creation of mass purchasing powerthrough paper money and central banking. The PMPs therefore quickly gravitatedtoward the statist Whig Party, and then to the vehemently anti-Catholic American(or “Know-Nothing”) Party, finally culminating in all-out support for theRepublican Party, the “party of great moral ideas.”[12] [part0018.html#fn12]On the other hand, all religious groups that did not want to be subjected to thePMP theocracy—Catholics, High Church (or liturgical) German Lutherans,old-fashioned Calvinists, secularists, and Southern personalsalvationists—naturally gravitated toward the laissez-faire political party, theDemocrats. Becoming known as the “party of personal liberty,” the Democratschampioned small government and laissez-faire on the national economic level aswell, including separation of government and business, free trade, and hardmoney, which included the separation of government from the banking system.The Democrat Party was the champion of laissez-faire, minimal government, anddecentralization from its inception until its takeover by the ultra-pietistBryanite forces in 1896. After 1830, the laissez-faire Democratic constituencywas greatly strengthened by an influx of religious groups opposed to Yankeetheocracy.If postmillennial Protestantism provided a crucial impetus toward Statedictation over society and the economy, another vital force on behalf of thepartnership of government and industry was the zeal of businessmen andindustrialists eager to jump on the bandwagon of state privilege. Vital to theRepublican coalition, then, were the big railroads, dependent on governmentsubvention and heavily in debt, and the Pennsylvania iron and steel industry,almost chronically inefficient and in perpetual need of high tariffs to protectthem from import competition. When industrialists, as was often the case, wereat one and the same time Yankee postmillennial pietists seeking to impose aperfect society, and also inefficient industrialists seeking government aid, thefusion of religious doctrine and economic interest became a powerful force inguiding their actions.3. YANKEE WOMEN: THE DRIVING FORCEOf all the Yankee activists in behalf of statist “reform,” perhaps the mostformidable force was the legion of Yankee women, in particular those of middle-or upper-class background, and especially spinsters whose busybody inclinationswere not fettered by the responsibilities of home and hearth. One of the PMPs’favorite reforms was to bring about women’s suffrage, which was accomplished invarious states and localities long before a constitutional amendment imposed iton the entire country. One major reason: it was obvious to everyone that, giventhe chance to vote, most Yankee women would be quick to troop to the ballot-box,whereas Catholic women believed their place to be at home and with the family,and would not bother about political considerations. Hence, women’s suffrage wasa way of weighting the total vote toward the postmillennialists and away fromthe Catholics and High Church Lutherans.The impact of the revivalist transformation of Protestantism in the 1820s and1830s upon female activism is well described by the feminist historian CarrollSmith-Rosenberg:> Women’s religious movements multiplied. Female revival converts formed Holy> Bands to assist the evangelist in his revival efforts. They gathered with him> at dawn to help plan the day’s revival strategies. They posted bills in public> places urging attendance at revival meetings, pressured merchants to close> their shops and hold prayer services, and buttonholed sinful men and prayed> with them. Although “merely women,” they led prayer vigils in their homes that> extended far into the night. These women for the most part were married,> respected members of respectable communities. Yet, transformed by millennial> zeal, they disregarded virtually every restraint upon women’s behavior. They> self-righteously commanded sacred space as their own. They boldly carried> Christ’s message to the streets, even into the new urban slums.[13]> [part0018.html#fn13]The early suffragette leaders began as ardent prohibitionists, the majorpolitical concern of the postmillennial Protestants. They were all Yankees,centering their early activities in the Yankee heartland of upstate New York.Thus, Susan Brownell Anthony, born in Massachusetts, was the founder of thefirst women’s temperance (prohibitionist) society, in upstate New York in 1852.Susan B. Anthony’s co-leader in generating suffragette and prohibitionistwomen’s activities, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, came from Johnston, New York, in theheart of the Yankee Burned-Over District. Organized prohibitionism began toflourish in the winter of 1873–74, when spontaneous “Women’s Crusades” surgedinto the streets, dedicated to direct action to closing down the saloons.Beginning in Ohio, thousands of women took part in such actions during thatwinter. After the spontaneous violence died down, the women organized theWomen’s Christian Temperance Union (W.C.T.U.) in Fredonia (near Buffalo), NewYork, in the summer of 1874. Spreading like wildfire, the W.C.T.U. became theoutstanding force for decades on behalf of the outlawry of liquor.What is less well known is that the W.C.T.U. was not a one-issue organization.By the 1880s, the W.C.T.U. was pushing, throughout states and localities, for acomprehensive statist program for government intervention and social welfare.These measures included the outlawing of licensed brothels and red lightdistricts, imposition of a maximum 8-hour working day, the establishment ofgovernment facilities for neglected and dependent children, government sheltersfor children of working mothers, government recreation facilities for the urbanpoor, federal aid to education, mothers’ education by government, and governmentvocational training for women. In addition, the W.C.T.U. pushed for the new“kindergarten movement,” which sought to lower the age when children began tocome under the purview of teachers and other educational professionals.[14][part0018.html#fn14]4. PROGRESSIVES AND THE GRADUAL SECULARIZATION OF POSTMILLENNIAL PIETISM: ELY,DEWEY, AND COMMONSA critical but largely untold story in American political history is the gradualbut inexorable secularization of Protestant postmillennial pietism over thedecades of the middle and late 19th century.[15] [part0018.html#fn15] Theemphasis, almost from the beginning, was to use government to stamp out sin andto create a perfect society in order to usher in the Kingdom of God on Earth.Over the decades, the emphasis slowly but surely shifted: more and more awayfrom Christ and religion, which became ever-vaguer and woollier, and more andmore toward a Social Gospel, with government correcting, organizing, andeventually planning the perfect society. From paternalistic mender of socialproblems, government became more and more divinized, more and more seen as theleader and molder of the organic social whole. In short, Whigs, Know-Nothings,and Republicans were increasingly becoming Progressives, who were to dominatethe polity and the culture after 1900; a few of the more radical thinkers wereopenly socialist, with the rest content to be organic statists andcollectivists. And as Marxism became increasingly popular in Europe after the1880s, the progressives prided themselves on being organic statistmiddle-of-the-roaders between old fashioned dog-eat-dog laissez-faireindividualism on the one hand, and proletarian socialism on the other. Instead,the progressive would provide to society a Third Way in which Big Government, inthe service of the joint truths of science and religion, would harmonize allclasses into one organic whole.By the 1880s, the focus of postmillennial Christian endeavor began to shift fromOberlin College to the liberal “New Theology” at Andover Theological Seminary inMassachusetts. The Andover liberals, as Jean Quandt points out, stressed “theimmanence of God in nature and society, a concept derived in part from thedoctrine of evolution.” Furthermore, “Christian conversion ... came more andmore to mean the gradual moral improvement of the individual.” Thus, saysQuandt, “Andover’s identification of God with all the regenerating andcivilizing forces in society, together with its Arminian emphasis on man’s moralachievements, pointed toward an increasingly secular version of America’stransfiguration.”[16] [part0018.html#fn16] Professor Quandt sums up the gradualbut fateful change as a change that amounted to “a secularization of theeschatological vision.” As Quandt writes:> The outpourings of the Holy Spirit which were to usher in the kingdom of the> 1850s were replaced, in the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era, by advances in> knowledge, culture, and ethical Christianity. Whereas evangelical> Protestantism had insisted that the kingdom would come by the grace of God> acting in history and not by any natural process, the later version often> substituted the providential gift of science for redeeming grace. These> changes toward a more naturalistic view of the world’s progress were> paralleled by a changing attitude toward the agencies of redemption. The> churches and the benevolent societies connected with them were still> considered important instruments of the coming kingdom, but great significance> was now attached to such impersonal messianic agencies as the natural and> social sciences. The spirit of love and brotherhood ... was (now) often> regarded as an achievement of human evolution with only tenuous ties to a> transcendent deity.[17] [part0018.html#fn17]Progressive intellectuals and social and political leaders reached their apogeein a glittering cohort which, remarkably, were almost all born in precisely theyear 1860, or right around it.[18] [part0018.html#fn18]Richard T. Ely was born on a farm in western New York, near Fredonia, in theBuffalo area.[19] [part0018.html#fn19] His father, Ezra, a descendant of Puritanrefugees from Restoration England, came from a long line of Congregationalistand Presbyterian clergy. Ezra, who had come from rural Connecticut, was a farmerwhose poor soil was suited only to grow barley; yet, as an ardentprohibitionist, he refused to give his sanction to barley, since its mainconsumer product was beer. Highly intense about religion, Ezra was an extremeSabbatarian who prohibited games or books (except the Bible) upon the Sabbath,and hated tobacco as well as liquor.Richard was highly religious but not as focused as his father; he grew upmortified at not having had a conversion experience. He learned early to getalong with wealthy benefactors, borrowing a substantial amount of money from hiswealthy Columbia classmate, Edwin R.A. Seligman, of the New Yorkinvestment-banking family. Graduating from Columbia in 1876, in a country wherethere was not yet a Ph.D. program, Ely joined most of the economists,historians, philosophers, and social scientists of his generation in travelingto Germany, the land of the Ph.D., for his doctorate. As in the case of hisfellows, Ely was enchanted with the third way or organic statism that he and theothers thought they found in Hegel and in German social doctrine. As luck wouldhave it, Ely, on his return from Germany with a Ph.D. at the young age of 28,became the first instructor in political economy at America’s first graduateuniversity, Johns Hopkins. There, Ely taught and found disciples in a glitteringarray of budding statist economists, social scientists, and historians, some ofwhom were barely older than he was, including Chicago sociologist and economistAlbion W. Small (b. 1854), Chicago economist Edward W. Bemis, economist andsociologist Edward Alsworth Ross, City College of New York president John H.Finlay, Wisconsin historian Frederick Jackson Turner, and future presidentWoodrow Wilson.During the 1880s, Ely, like so many postmillennial pietists remarkablyenergetic, founded the American Economic Association and ran it with an ironhand for several years; he also founded, and became the first president of, theInstitute for Christian Sociology, which pledged “to present ... (God’s) kingdomas the complete ideal of human society to be realized on earth.” Ely alsovirtually took over the summer evangelical Chautauqua movement, and histextbook, Introduction to Political Economy, became a best-seller, largely bybeing distributed through, and becoming required reading for, the ChautauquaLiterary and Scientific Circle for literally a half-century. In 1891, Elyfounded the Christian Social Union of the Protestant Episcopal Church, alongwith the avowedly socialist Rev. William Dwight Porter Bliss, who was thefounder of the Society of Christian Socialists. Ely was also enamored by thesocialist “One Big Union” Knights of Labor, which he hailed as “trulyscientific” and lauded in his book The Labor Movement (1886); the Knights,however, collapsed abruptly after 1887.Discouraged about not getting a full professorship at Hopkins, Ely, movingthrough his old student Frederick Jackson Turner, who was teaching at Wisconsin,managed to land not only a professorship at that university in 1892, but alsobecame director, with the highest salary on campus, of a new institute, a Schoolof Economics, Political Science, and History. A gifted academic empire-builder,he managed to acquire funding for an assistant professor, a graduate fellow, anda large library at his institute.Ely brought his favorite former students to Wisconsin, and Ely and his formerand later students became the key advisors to the administration of Robert M. LaFollette (b. 1855), who became the Progressive governor of Wisconsin in 1900.Through La Follette, Ely and the others pioneered welfare-state programs on astate level. Significantly, La Follette had gotten his start in Wisconsinpolitics as an ardent prohibitionist.The key to Ely’s thought was that he virtually divinized the State. “God,” hedeclared, “works through the State in carrying out His purposes more universallythan through any other institution.”[20] [part0018.html#fn20] Once again,Professor Quandt sums up Ely best:> In Ely’s eyes, government was the God-given instrument through which we had to> work. Its preeminence as a divine instrument was based on the post-Reformation> abolition of the division between the sacred and the secular and on the> State’s power to implement ethical solutions to public problems. The same> identification of sacred and secular ... enabled Ely to both divinize the> state and socialize Christianity: he thought of government as God’s main> instrument of redemption.[21] [part0018.html#fn21]It must not be thought that Ely’s vision was totally secular. On the contrary,the Kingdom was never far from his thoughts. It was the task of the socialsciences to “teach the complexities of the Christian duty of brotherhood.”Through such instruments as the industrial revolution, the universities, and thechurches, through the fusion of religion and social science, there will arrive,Ely believed, “the New Jerusalem” “which we are all eagerly awaiting.” And then,“the earth [will become] a new earth, and all its cities, cities of God.” Andthat Kingdom, according to Ely, was approaching rapidly.A striking example of the secularization of a postmillennial progressive leaderis the famed founder of pragmatist philosophy and progressive education, theprophet of atheistic higher Democracy, philosopher John Dewey (b. 1859). It islittle known that in an early stage of his seemingly endless career, Dewey wasan ardent preacher of postmillennialism and the coming of the Kingdom.Addressing the Students’ Christian Association at Michigan, Dewey argued thatthe Biblical notion of the Kingdom of God come to earth was a valuable truthwhich had been lost to the world, but now, the growth of modern science and thecommunication of knowledge has made the world ripe for the temporal realizationof “the Kingdom of God... the common incarnate Life, the purpose ... animatingall men and binding them together into one harmonious whole of sympathy.”Science and democracy, exhorted Dewey, marching together, reconstruct religioustruth, and with this new truth, religion could help bring about “the spiritualunification of humanity, the realization of the brotherhood of man, all thatChrist called the Kingdom of God ... on earth.”For Dewey, democracy was “a spiritual fact.” Indeed, it is the “means by whichthe revelation of truth is carried on.” It was only in democracy, assertedDewey, that “the community of ideas and interest through community of action,that the incarnation of God in man (man, that is to say, as an organ ofuniversal truth) becomes a living, present thing.”Dewey concluded with a call to action: “Can anyone ask for better or moreinspiring work? Surely to fuse into one the social and religious motive, tobreak down the barriers of Pharisaism and self-assertion which isolate religiousthought and conduct from the common life of man, to realize the state as oneCommonwealth of truth—surely, this is a cause worth battling for.”[22][part0018.html#fn22] Thus, with Dewey the final secularization is at hand: thetruth of Jesus Christ was the unfolding truth brought to man by modern scienceand modern democracy. Clearly, it was but one small step for John Dewey, as wellas for other, similarly situated progressives, to abandon Christ and to keep hisardent faith in government, science, and democracy to bring about an atheizedKingdom of God on earth.[23] [part0018.html#fn23]If Richard T. Ely was the leading PMP and progressive in economics and thesocial sciences, the leading progressive activist was his indefatigable andbeloved No. 2 man, Professor John Rogers Commons (b. 1862). Commons was astudent of Ely at Johns Hopkins graduate school, but even though he flunked outof graduate school, he continued ever afterward as Ely’s right-hand man andperpetual activist, becoming professor of economics at the University ofWisconsin. Commons was a major force in the National Civic Federation, which wasthe leading Progressive organization pushing for statism in the economy. TheNational Civic Federation was a big-business-financed outfit that wrote andlobbied for model legislation on a state and federal level favoring stateunemployment insurance, federal regulation of trade, and regulation of publicutilities. Further, it was the dominant force for progressive policies from 1900until U.S. entry into World War I. Not only that, Commons was a founder and theleading force in the even more explicitly leftist American Association for LaborLegislation (AALL), powerful from 1907 on in pushing for public works, minimumwages, maximum hours, and pro-union legislation. The AALL, financed byRockefeller and Morgan industrialists, was highly influential in the 1920s and1930s. The executive secretary of the AALL was for many decades John B. Andrews,who began as a graduate assistant of Commons at the University of Wisconsin.John R. Commons was a descendant of the famed English Puritan martyr JohnRogers. His parents moved from rural Vermont to the heavily Yankee, rabidly PMPWestern Reserve section of northeastern Ohio. His father was a farmer, hisextremely energetic mother a schoolteacher and graduate of the virtual PMPheadquarters, Oberlin College. The family moved to northeastern Indiana.Commons’ mother, the financial mainstay of the family, was a highly religiouspietist Presbyterian and an ardent lifelong Republican and prohibitionist. MaCommons was anxious for her son to become a minister, and when Commons enrolledin Oberlin in 1882, his mother went with him, mother and son founding andediting a prohibitionist magazine at Oberlin. Although a Republican, Commonsvoted Prohibitionist in the national election of 1884. Commons felt himselflucky to be at Oberlin, and to be in at the beginnings there of the Anti-SaloonLeague, the single-issue pressure group that was to become the greatest singleforce in bringing Prohibition to America. The national organizer of the leaguewas Howard H. Russell, then a theological student at Oberlin.At Oberlin, Commons found a beloved mentor, James Monroe, professor of politicalscience and history, who managed to get two Oberlin trustees to finance Commons’graduate studies at Johns Hopkins. Monroe himself was a deeply religious PMP, aprotectionist and prohibitionist, and for 30 years had been a RepublicanCongressman from the Western Reserve. Commons was graduated from Oberlin in 1888and proceeded to Johns Hopkins.[24] [part0018.html#fn24] Before going toWisconsin, Commons taught at several colleges, including Oberlin, IndianaUniversity, and Syracuse, and helped found the American Institute for ChristianSociology on behalf of Christian Socialism.Not only did Commons go on to Wisconsin to become the major inspirer andactivist of the “Wisconsin Idea,” helping to set up the welfare and regulatorystate in that region, several of his doctoral students at Wisconsin were tobecome highly influential in the Roosevelt New Deal. Selig Perlman, who wasappointed to the Commons Chair at Wisconsin was, following his mentor, the majortheoretician for the policies and practices of Commons’ beloved AmericanFederation of Labor. And two of Commons’ other Wisconsin students, Arthur J.Altemeyer and Edwin E. Witte, were both high officials in the IndustrialCommission of Wisconsin, founded by Commons to administer that state’s pro-unionlegislation. Both Altemeyer and Witte went on from there to be major founders ofFranklin Roosevelt’s Social Security legislation.[25] [part0018.html#fn25]5. YANKEE WOMEN PROGRESSIVESThe Elys, Commonses, and Deweys might have might have been more notable, but theYankee women progressives provided the shock troops of the progressive movementand hence the burgeoning welfare state. As in the case of the males, gradual butirresistible secularization set in over the decades. The abolitionist andslightly later cohort were fanatically postmillennial Christian, but the laterprogressive cohort, born, as we have seen, around 1860, were no less fanaticalbut more secular and less Christian-Kingdom oriented. The progression wasvirtually inevitable; after all, if your activism as a Christian evangelist hadvirtually nothing to do with Christian creed or liturgy or even personal reform,but was focused exclusively in using the force of government to shape upeveryone, stamp out sin, and usher in a perfect society, if government is reallyGod’s major instrument of salvation, then the role of Christianity in one’spractical activity began to fade into the background. Christianity became takenfor granted, a background buzz; one’s practical activity was designed to use thegovernment to stamp out liquor, poverty, or whatever is defined as sin, and toimpose one’s own values and principles on the society.Not only that, but by the late 19th century, as the 1860 cohort came of age,there arose greater and more specialized opportunities for female activism onbehalf of statism and government intervention. The older groups, the Women’sCrusades, were short-run activities, and hence could rely on short bursts ofenergy by married women. However, as female activism became professionalized,and became specialized into social work and settlement houses, there was littleroom left for any women except upper-class and upper-middle-class spinsters, whoanswered the call in droves. The settlement houses, it must be emphasized, werenot simply centers for private help to the poor; they were, quite consciously,spearheads for social change and government intervention and reform.The most prominent of the Yankee progressive social workers, and emblematic ofthe entire movement, was Jane Addams (b. 1860). Her father, John H. Addams, wasa pietist Quaker who settled in northern Illinois, constructed a sawmill,invested in railroads and banks, and became one of the wealthiest men innorthern Illinois. John H. Addams was a lifelong Republican, who attended thefounding meeting of the Republican Party at Ripon, Wisconsin in 1854 and servedas a Republican State Senator for 16 years.Graduating from one of the first all-women colleges, the Rockford FemaleSeminary, in 1881, Jane Addams was confronted by the death of her belovedfather. Intelligent, upper class, and energetic, she was faced with the dilemmaof what to do with her life. She had no interest in men, so marriage was not inthe cards; indeed, in her lifetime, she seems to have had several intenselesbian affairs.[26] [part0018.html#fn26]After eight years of indecision, Jane Addams decided to devote herself to socialwork and founded the famed settlement house, Hull House, in the Chicago slums in1889. Jane was inspired by reading the highly influential English art criticJohn Ruskin, who was an Oxford professor, Christian Socialist, and bitter criticof laissez-faire capitalism. Ruskin was the charismatic leader of ChristianSocialism in England, which was influential in the ranks of the Anglican clergy.One of his disciples was the historian Arnold Toynbee, in whose honor CanonSamuel A. Barnett, another Ruskinian, founded the settlement house of ToynbeeHall in London in 1884. In 1888, Jane Addams went to London to observe ToynbeeHall, and there she met Canon W.H. Freemantle, close friend and mentor of CanonBarnett, and this visit settled the matter, inspiring Jane Addams to go back toChicago to found Hull House, along with her former classmate and intimatelesbian friend Ellen Gates Starr. The major difference between Toynbee Hall andits American counterparts is that the former was staffed by male social workerswho stayed for a few years and then moved on to build their careers, whereas theAmerican settlement houses almost all constituted lifelong careers for spinsterladies.Jane Addams was able to use her upper-class connections to acquire ferventsupporters, many of them women who became intimate and probably lesbian friendsof Miss Addams. One staunch financial supporter was Mrs. Louise de Koven Bowen(b. 1859), whose father, John de Koven, a Chicago banker, had amassed a greatfortune. Mrs. Bowen became an intimate friend of Jane Addams; she also becamethe treasurer and even built a house for the settlement. Other society womensupporters of Hull House included Mary Rozet Smith, who had a lesbian affairwith Jane Addams, and Mrs. Russell Wright, the mother of the future-renownedarchitect Frank Lloyd Wright. Mary Rozet Smith, indeed, was able to replaceEllen Starr in Jane Addams’s lesbian affection. She did so in two ways: by beingtotally submissive and self-deprecating to the militant Miss Addams, and bysupplying copious financial support to Hull House. Mary and Jane proclaimedthemselves “married” to each other.One of Jane Addams’s close colleagues, and probable lesbian lover, at Hull Housewas the tough, truculent Julia Clifford Lathrop (b. 1858), whose father,William, had migrated from upstate New York to Rockford in northernIllinois.[27] [part0018.html#fn27] William Lathrop, an attorney, was adescendant of the eminent English Nonconformist and Yankee minister, theReverend John Lathrop. William became a trustee of the Rockford Female Seminary,and was elected Republican U.S. Senator from Illinois. His daughter Julia wasgraduated from the Seminary earlier than Addams, and then went on to VassarCollege. Julia Lathrop moved to Hull House in 1890, and from there developed alifelong career in social work and government service. Julia founded the firstJuvenile Court in the country, in Chicago in 1899, and then moved on to becomethe first female member of the Illinois State Board of Charities, and presidentof the National Conference of Social Work. In 1912, Lathrop was appointed byPresident Taft as head of the first U.S. Children’s Bureau.Ensconced in the federal government, the Children’s Bureau became an outpost ofthe welfare state and social work engaging in activities that eerily andunpleasantly remind one of the modern era. Thus, the Children’s Bureau was anunremitting center of propaganda and advocacy of federal subsidies, programs,and propaganda on behalf of the nation’s mothers and children—a kind of grislyforeshadowing of “family values” and Hillary Rodham Clinton’s concerns for “thechildren” and the Children’s Defense Fund. Thus, the Children’s Bureauproclaimed “Baby Week” in March 1916, and again in 1917, and designated theentire year 1918 as “The Year of the Child.”After World War I, Lathrop and the Children’s Bureau lobbied for, and pushedthrough Congress in late 1921, the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and InfancyProtection Act, providing federal funds to states that set up child hygiene orchild welfare bureaus, as well as providing public instruction in maternal andinfant care by nurses and physicians. Here we had the beginnings of socializedmedicine as well as the socialized family. This public instruction was providedin home conferences and health centers, and to health care professionals in eacharea. It was also chillingly provided that these states, under the carrot offederal subsidy, would remove children from the homes of parents providing“inadequate home care,” the standard of adequacy to be determined, of course, bythe government and its alleged professionals. There was also to be compulsorybirth registration for every baby and federal aid for maternity and infancy.Julia Lathrop was instrumental in persuading Sheppard-Towner to change theoriginal bill from a welfare measure to those unable to pay into a bill designedto encompass everyone. At Lathrop put it, “The bill is designed to emphasizepublic responsibility for the protection of life just as already through ourpublic schools we recognize public responsibility in the education of children.”The logic of cumulative government intervention was irresistible; it’sunfortunate that no one turned the logic the other way and instituted a drivefor the abolition of public schooling.If none of the opponents of Sheppard-Towner went so far as to call for theabolition of public schooling, James A. Reed (D-Mo.), the staunch laissez-faireSenator, did well enough. Caustically, Senator Reed declared that “It is nowproposed to turn the control of the mothers of the land over to a few singleladies holding government jobs in Washington. ... We would better reverse theproposal and provide for a committee of mothers to take charge of the old maidsand teach them how to acquire a husband and have babies of their own.”[28][part0018.html#fn28] Perhaps Senator Reed thereby cut to the heart of themotivation of these Yankee progressives.At about the same time that Jane Addams and friends were founding Hull House,settlement houses were being founded in New York and Boston, also by spinsterYankee females, and also under the inspiration of Toynbee Hall. Actually, thefounder of the first ephemeral settlement in New York was the male Stanton Coit(b. 1857), born in northern Ohio to a prosperous merchant, and a descendant ofthe Puritan Massachusetts Yankee, John Coit. Coit obtained a Ph.D. from theUniversity of Berlin, worked at Toynbee Hall, and then established theshort-lived Neighborhood Guild settlement in New York in 1886; it failed thefollowing year. Inspired by this example, however, three Yankee lesbiansfollowed by founding the College Settlement Association in 1887, whichestablished College Settlements in New York in 1889, and in Boston andPhiladelphia several years later. The leading female founder was Vida DuttonScudder (b. 1861), a wealthy Bostonian and daughter of a Congregationalmissionary to India. After graduating from Smith College in 1884, Vida studiedliterature at Oxford, and became a disciple of Ruskin and a Christian Socialist,ending up teaching at Wellesley College for over 40 years. Vida Scudder becamean Episcopalian, a frank socialist, and a member of the Women’s Trade UnionLeague. The two other founders of the College Settlements were Katharine Coman(b. 1857), and her long-time lesbian lover Katharine Lee Bates. Katharine Comanwas born in northern Ohio to a father who had been an ardent abolitionist andteacher in upstate New York and who moved to a farm in Ohio as a result ofwounds suffered in the Civil War. Graduating from the University of Michigan,Coman taught history and political economy at Wellesley, and later becamechairman of the Wellesley department of economics. Coman and Bates traveled toEurope to study and promote social insurance in the United States. KatharineBates was a professor of English at Wellesley. Coman became a leader of theNational Consumers League and of the Women’s Trade Union League.The founder of the concept of the Children’s Bureau, Florence Kelley, wholobbied for both the Children’s Bureau and Sheppard-Towner, was one of the fewwomen activists who was in some way unique and not paradigmatic. In many ways,she did share the traits of the other progressive ladies. She was born in 1859,her father was a wealthy, lifelong Republican Congressman from Philadelphia,William D. Kelley, whose devotion to protective tariffs, especially for thePennsylvania iron industry, was so intense as to earn him the sobriquet “PigIron” Kelley. A Protestant Irishman, he was an abolitionist and RadicalRepublican.Florence Kelley differed from her colleagues on two counts: (1) she was the onlyone who was an outright Marxist, and (2) she was married and not a lesbian.However, in the long run, these differences did not matter very much. ForKelley’s open Marxism was not, in practice, very different, in policyconclusions, from the less-systematic Fabian socialism or progressivism of hersisterhood. As such, she was able to take her place at the end of a spectrumthat was not really very far from the mainstream of non-Marxian ladies. On thesecond count, Florence Kelley managed to dispose of her husband in fairly shortorder, and to palm off the raising of her three children onto doting friends.Thus, home and hearth proved no obstacle to Florence Kelley’s militancy.Graduating from Cornell, Florence went to study at the University of Zurich.There she promptly became a Marxist and translated Engels’s Condition of theWorking Class in England into English. In Zurich, Florence met and married aRussian—Jewish Marxist medical student, Lazare Wischnewetsky, in 1884, movingwith her husband to New York, and having three children by 1887. In New York,Florence promptly formed the New York Consumers League and got a law passed forinspecting women in factories. In 1891, Florence fled her husband with her kidsand went to Chicago for reasons that remain unknown to her biographers. InChicago, she gravitated inevitably to Hull House, where she stayed for a decade.During this time, the large, volcanic, and blustery Florence Kelley helped toradicalize Jane Addams. Kelley lobbied successfully in Illinois for a lawcreating a legal-maximum eight-hour work day for women. She then became thefirst chief factory inspector in the state of Illinois, gathering about her anall-socialist staff.Florence Kelley’s husband, Dr. Wischnewetsky, had been pushed off the pages ofhistory. But what about her children? While Florence went about the task ofsocializing Illinois, she was able to pass off the raising of her children ontoher friends Henry Demarest Lloyd, prominent leftist Chicago Tribune journalist,and his wife, the daughter of one of the owners of the Tribune.In 1899, Florence Kelley returned to New York, where she resided for the nextquarter-century at what was by then the most prominent settlement house in NewYork City, the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side. There, Kelleyfounded the National Consumers League, and was the chief lobbyist for thefederal Children’s Bureau and for Sheppard-Towner. She battled for minimum wagelaws and maximum-hours laws for women, fought for an Equal Rights Amendment tothe Constitution, and was a founding member of the NAACP. When accused of beinga Bolshevik in the 1920s, Florence Kelley disingenuously pointed to herPhiladelphia blue blood heritage—how could someone of such a family possibly bea Marxist?[29] [part0018.html#fn29]Another prominent and very wealthy Yankee woman in New York City was MaryMelinda Kingsbury Simkhovitch (b. 1867). Born in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts,Mary Melinda was the daughter of Isaac Kingsbury, a prominent Congregationalistand Republican merchant. She was the niece of an executive of the PennsylvaniaRailroad and a cousin of the head of Standard Oil of California. Graduating fromBoston University, Mary Melinda toured Europe with her mother, studied inGermany, and was deeply moved by socialism and Marxism. Becoming engaged toVladimir Simkhovitch, a Russian scholar, she joined him in New York when heacquired a post at Columbia. Before marrying Simkhovitch, Mary Melinda becamehead resident of the College Settlement in New York, studied socialism further,and learned Yiddish so as to be able to communicate better with her Lower EastSide neighbors. Even after marrying Simkhovitch and acquiring two children, MaryMelinda founded her own settlement at Greenwich House, joined the New YorkConsumers League and Women’s Trade Union League, and fought for governmentold-age pensions and public housing.Particularly important for New York statism and social reform were the wealthyand socially prominent Dreier family, which gave rise to several activedaughters. The Dreiers were German-Americans, but they could just as well havebeen Yankees, since they were fervent—if not fanatical—German evangelicalpietists. Their father, Theodore Dreier, was an emigrant from Bremen who hadrisen to become a successful merchant; during the Civil War, he returned toBremen and married his younger cousin, Dorothy Dreier, the daughter of anevangelical minister. Every morning, the four Dreier daughters and theirbrother, Edward (b. 1872), were swathed in Bible readings and the singing ofhymns.In 1898, father Dreier died, leaving several million dollars to his family.Eldest daughter Margaret (b.1868) was able to dominate her siblings intoengaging in radical and philanthropic activities at her beck and call.[30][part0018.html#fn30] To dramatize her altruism and alleged “sacrifice,” MargaretDreier habitually wore shoddy clothes. Active in the Consumers League, Margaretjoined, and heavily financed, the new Women’s Trade Union League in late 1904,joined by her sister Mary. Soon, Margaret was president of the New York WTUL andtreasurer of the national WTUL. Indeed, Margaret Dreier presided over the WTULfrom 1907 until 1922.In the spring of 1905, Margaret Dreier met and married the Chicago-basedprogressive adventurer Raymond Robins (b. 1873). They had met, appropriatelyenough, when Robins delivered a lecture on the Social Gospel at an evangelicalchurch in New York. The Robinses became the country’s premier progressivecouple; Margaret’s activities scarcely slowed down, since Chicago was at leastas active a center for the welfare reformers as New York.Raymond Robins had a checkered career as a wanderer and nomad. Born in Florida,deserted by his father and absent a mother, Robins wandered around the countryand managed to earn a law degree in California, where he became a pro-unionprogressive. Prospecting gold in Alaska, he saw a vision of a flaming cross inthe Alaska wilds and became a social-gospel-oriented minister. Moving to Chicagoin 1901, Robins became a leading settlement house worker, associating, ofcourse, with Hull House and “Saint Jane” Addams.Two years after the Robins-Dreier marriage, sister Mary Dreier came to Robinsand confessed her overwhelming love. Robins persuaded Mary to transmute hershameful secret passion on the altar of leftist social reform, and the two ofthem engaged in a lifelong secret correspondence based on their two-person“Order of the Flaming Cross.”Perhaps the most important function of Margaret Dreier for the cause was hersuccess in bringing top female wealth into financial and political support ofthe leftist and welfare-state programs of the Women’s Trade Union League.Included among WTUL supporters were Anne Morgan, daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan;Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, daughter of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.; Dorothy WhitneyStraight, heiress to the Rockefeller-oriented Whitney family; Mary ElizaMcDowell (b. 1854), a Hull House alumnus whose father owned a steel mill inChicago; and the very wealthy Anita McCormick Blaine, daughter of CyrusMcCormick, inventor of the mechanical reaper, who had already been inducted intothe movement by Jane Addams.[31] [part0018.html#fn31]We should not leave the Chicago scene without noting a crucial activist andacademic transition to the next generation. An important academic wealthyspinster was Sophonisba Breckinridge (b. 1866), who came from a prominentKentucky family and was the great-granddaughter of a U.S. Senator. She, too, wasnot a Yankee, but she was pretty clearly a lesbian. Unhappy as a lawyer inKentucky, Sophonisba went to the University of Chicago graduate school andbecame the first woman Ph.D. in political science in 1901. She continued toteach social science and social work at the University of Chicago for the restof her career, becoming the mentor and probable long-time lesbian companion ofEdith Abbott (b. 1876). Edith Abbott, born in Nebraska, had been secretary ofthe Boston Trade Union League and had studied at the London School of Economics,where she was strongly influence by the Webbs, leaders of Fabian Socialism. Shelived and worked, predictably, at a London Settlement House. Then Edith studiedfor a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago, which she earned in 1905.Becoming an instructor at Wellesley, Edith soon joined her slightly youngersister Grace at Hull House in 1908, where the two sisters lived for the nextdozen years, Edith as social research director of Hull House. In the early1920s, Edith Abbott became Dean of the University of Chicago School of SocialService Administration and co-edited the school’s Social Service Review with herfriend and mentor, Sophonisba Breckinridge.Grace Abbott, two years younger than Edith, took more of an activist route. TheAbbott sisters’ mother had come from upstate New York and graduated fromRockford Female Seminary; their father was an Illinois lawyer who becameLieutenant Governor of Nebraska. Grace Abbott, also living at Hull House and aclose friend of Jane Addams, became Julia Clifford Lathrop’s assistant at thefederal Children’s Bureau in 1917, and, in 1921, succeeded her mentor Lathrop ashead of the Children’s Bureau.If the female social reform activists were almost all Yankee, by the late 19thcentury, Jewish women were beginning to add their leaven to the lump. Of thecrucial 1860s cohort, the most important Jewess was Lillian D. Wald (b. 1867).Born to an upper-middle-class German and Polish-Jewish family in Cincinnati,Lillian and her family soon moved to Rochester, where she became a nurse. Shethen organized, in the Lower East Side of New York, the Nurses’ Settlement,which was soon to become the famed Henry Street Settlement. It was Lillian Waldwho first suggested a federal Children’s Bureau to President Theodore Rooseveltin 1905, and who led the agitation for a federal constitutional amendmentoutlawing child labor. While she was not a Yankee, Lillian Wald continued in thedominant tradition by being a lesbian, forming a long-term lesbian relationshipwith her associate Lavinia Dock. Wald, while not wealthy herself, had an uncannyability to gain financing for Henry Street, including top Jewish financiers suchas Jacob Schiff and Mrs. Solomon Loeb of the Wall Street investment-banking firmof Kuhn-Loeb, and Julius Rosenwald, then head of Sears Roebuck. Also prominentin financing Henry Street was the Milbank Fund, of the Rockefeller-affiliatedfamily who owned the Borden Milk Company.Rounding out the important contingent of socialist-activist Jews were the fourGoldmark sisters, Helen, Pauline, Josephine, and Alice. Their father had beenborn in Poland, became a physician in Vienna, and was a member of the AustrianParliament. Fleeing to the United States after the failed Revolution of 1848,Dr. Goldmark became a physician and chemist, became wealthy by inventingpercussion caps, and helped organized the Republican Party in the 1850s. TheGoldmarks settled in Indiana.Dr. Goldmark died in 1881, leaving eldest daughter Helen as the head of thefamily. Helen married the eminent Felix Adler, philosopher and founder of theSociety for Ethical Culture in New York, a kind of Jewish Unitarianism. Alicemarried the eminent Boston Jewish lawyer Louis Dembitz Brandeis, helping toradicalize Brandeis from moderate classical liberal to socialistic progressive.Pauline (b. 1874), after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1896, remained single, didgraduate work at Columbia and Barnard in botany, zoology, and sociology, andthen became assistant secretary of the New York Consumers League. Even moresuccessful an activist was Josephine Clara Goldmark (b. 1877), who graduatedfrom Bryn Mawr in 1898, did graduate work in education at Barnard, and thenbecame publicity secretary of the National Consumers League and author of theNCL’s annual handbooks. In 1908, Josephine became chairman of the new NCLCommittee on Legislation, and she, her sister Pauline, and Florence Kelley(along with Alice) persuaded Brandeis to write his famed Brandeis brief in thecase of Muller v. Oregon (1908), claiming that the Oregon maximum-hours law forwomen was constitutional. In 1919, Josephine Goldmark continued her rise bybecoming secretary of the Rockefeller Foundation’s Committee for the Study ofNursing Education. Josephine Goldmark culminated her career by writing the firsthagiographical biography of her close friend and mentor in socialistic activism,Florence Kelley.[32] [part0018.html#fn32]6. THE NEW DEALIt was not long before these progressives and social reformers exerted an impacton American national politics. The Progressive Party was launched in 1912 by theMorgans—the party was headed by Morgan partner George W. Perkins—in a successfulattempt to nominate Theodore Roosevelt, and thereby destroy President WilliamHoward Taft, who had broken with his predecessor Roosevelt’s Pro-Morganpolicies. The Progressive Party included all the spearheads of this statistcoalition: academic progressives, Morgan businessmen, social-gospel Protestantministers, and, of course, our subjects, the leading progressive social workers.Thus, delegates to the national Progressive convention of 1912 in New York Cityincluded Jane Addams, Raymond Robins, and Lillian D. Wald, as well as HenryMoskowitz of the New York Society of Ethical Culture, and Mary KingsburySimkhovitch of New York’s Greenwich House. True to its feminist stance, theProgressive Party was also the first, except for the Prohibition Party, toinclude women delegates to the convention, and the first to name a womanelector, Helen J. Scott of Wisconsin. After the success of the Progressive Partyin the 1912 elections, the social workers and social scientists who had floodedinto the party were convinced that they were bringing the pristine values (orrather, non-values) of “science” to political affairs. Their statist proposalswere “scientific,” and any resistance to such measures was, therefore, narrowand opposed to the spirit of science and social welfare.In its permanent organization of 1913, the Progressive Party adopted “A Plan ofWork” proposed by Jane Addams just after the election. Its major division wasProgressive Science, headed by New York social worker, attorney, and sociologistFrances A. Kellor. Assisting Frances Kellor as director of the LegislativeReference Bureau, a department of the Progressive Science division, was Chicagopro-union labor lawyer Donald Richberg, later to be prominent in the RailwayLabor Act of the 1920s and in the New Deal. Prominent in the Party’s Bureau ofEducation was none other than John Dewey. But particularly important was theParty’s Department of Social and Industrial Justice, headed by Jane Addams.Under her, Henry Moskowitz headed the Men’s Labor committee, and upper-classphilanthropist Mary E. McDowell headed Women’s Labor. The Social SecurityInsurance committee was headed by Paul Kellogg, editor of the leading socialwork magazine, Survey, while Lillian Wald played a prominent role in the ChildWelfare committee.[33] [part0018.html#fn33]More important than the heady few years of the Progressive Party, however, wasthe accelerating accumulation of influence and power in state and federalgovernment. In particular, the ladies’ settlement-house movement exertedenormous influence in shaping the New Deal, an influence that has been generallyunderrated.Take, for example, Mary H. Wilmarth, daughter of a gas fixture manufacturer andone of the upper-class Chicago socialites who had been brought into the group ofwealthy supporters of Hull House. Soon, Mary Wilmarth was to become one of themajor financial supporters of the radical Women’s Trade Union League. Mary’ssister, Anne Wilmarth, married a Progressive Chicago attorney, the curmudgeonHarold L. Ickes, who soon became legal counsel for the W.T.U.L. During the NewDeal, Ickes was to become Franklin Roosevelt’s high-profile Secretary of theInterior.At the other end of the social and ethnic spectrum from the Wilmarth sisters wasthe short, fiery, aggressively single Polish-American Jewess, Rose Schneiderman(b. 1882). One of the most frankly left-wing figures among the female agitators,Miss Schneiderman emigrated to New York in 1890 with her family, and at the ageof 21 became the organizer of the first women’s local of the Jewish SocialistUnited Cloth Hat and Cap Makers Union. Rose was prominent in the W.T.U.L. andplayed a key role in organizing the International Ladies Garment Workers Union,landing on that union’s Executive Board. Rose Schneiderman was appointed to theLabor Advisory Board during the New Deal.From Florence Kelley’s National Consumers League, there came into the New DealMolly Dewson, who became a member of Franklin Roosevelt’s Social Security Board,and Josephine Roche, who became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the NewDeal.But there were significantly bigger fish to fry than these few lesser figures.Perhaps the leading force emerging from the women’s statist, social-welfaremovement was none other than Eleanor Roosevelt (b. 1884), perhaps our firstbisexual First Lady. Eleanor fell under the influence of the passionatelyradical London prep school headmistress, Madame Marie Souvestre, who apparentlyset Eleanor on her lifelong course. Back in New York, Eleanor joined FlorenceKelley’s National Consumers League and became a lifelong reformer. During theearly 1920s, Eleanor was also active in working for, and financially supporting,Lillian Wald’s Henry Street Settlement and Mary Simkhovitch’s Greenwich House.In the early 1920s, Eleanor joined the W.T.U.L. and helped to finance thatradical organization, agitating for maximum-hour and minimum wage laws forwomen. Eleanor became a close friend of Molly Dewson, who later joined theSocial Security Board, and of Rose Schneiderman. Eleanor also brought herfriend, Mrs. Thomas W. Lamont, wife of the then-most-powerful Morgan partner,into her circle of social-reform agitators.The woman who rose highest in rank during the New Deal, and who was highlyinfluential in its social legislation, was Madame Frances Perkins (b. 1880),Secretary of Labor and first female Cabinet member in U.S. history. FrancesPerkins was born in Boston; both parents, who came from Maine, were activeCongregationalists, and her father, Fred, was a wealthy businessman. Franceswent to Mt. Holyoke in 1898, where she was elected class president. At Mt.Holyoke, Frances was swept up in the intense religious-pietist wave sweepingthat college; every Saturday night, each class would conduct a prayer meeting.The leader of what we might call the “religious Left” on the campus was Americanhistory professor Annabelle May Soule, who organized the Mt. Holyoke chapter ofthe National Consumers League, urging the abolition of child labor, and oflow-wage sweatshops, another prominent statist cause. It was a talk at the Mt.Holyoke by the charismatic Marxist and national leader of the NLC, FlorenceKelley, that changed Frances Perkins’s life and brought her on the road tolifelong welfare-state reform.In 1913, Frances Perkins was married, in a secret ceremony, to economist Paul C.Wilson. Wilson was a wealthy, cheerful, but sickly social reformer, providingFrances a good entry into municipal reform circles. While the marriage wassupposed to be a love match, it is doubtful how much the marriage meant to thetough-minded Perkins. Her friend, the unmarried welfare activist PaulineGoldmark, lamented that Frances had married, but added that she “did it to getit off her mind.” In a gesture of early feminism, Frances refused to take herhusband’s name. When she was named Secretary of Labor by Franklin Roosevelt, sherented a house with a close friend, the powerful and prodigiously wealthy MaryHarriman Rumsey, daughter of the great tycoon E.H. Harriman. The Harriman familywas extremely powerful in the New Deal, an influence that has been largelyneglected by historians. Mary Harriman Rumsey, who had been widowed in 1922, washead of the Maternity Center Administration in New York, and under the New Deal,she was chairman of the Consumer Advisory Committee of the National RecoveryAdministration.[34] [part0018.html#fn34]The close interrelation between social work, female activism, and extremelywealthy financiers is seen in the career of Frances Perkins’s close friend HenryBruere (b. 1882), who had been Wilson’s best friend. Bruere was born to aphysician in St. Charles, Missouri, went to the University of Chicago, attendeda couple of law schools, and then did graduate work in political science atColumbia. After graduate school, Bruere resided at College Settlement and thenUniversity Settlement, and then went on from there to become Personnel Directorat Morgan’s International Harvester Corporation.From then on, Bruere’s life was a revolving door, going from social agencies toprivate corporations and back again. Thus, after Harvester, Bruere founded theBureau of Municipal Research in New York and became president of the New YorkCity Board of Social Welfare. From there, it was on to vice president ofMetropolitan Life and the CEO of the Bowery Savings Bank, which became hisoperating base from the late 1920s until the early 1950s.But Henry Bruere still had plenty of time for good works. In the late 1920s andearly 1930s, Bruere was a member of the Executive Committee and Board of theWelfare Council of New York City, leading the drive for government unemploymentrelief. Bruere was appointed by Perkins as chairman of the New York StateCommittee on the Stabilization of Industry in 1930, which presaged the NationalRecovery Administration idea of coerced government cartelization of industry.During the New Deal, Bruere also became an advisor to the federal Home OwnersLoan Corporation, Federal Credit Association, to unemployment and old-ageinsurance, and was an advisor to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Bruerealso became executive assistant to William Woodin, Roosevelt’s first Secretaryof the Treasury.In the meanwhile, however, and this should be underscored, in addition to thehigh federal posts and social-welfare jobs, Bruere also hobnobbed with thefinancial greats, becoming a director of Harriman’s Union Pacific Railroad and atreasurer of Edward A. Filene’s left-liberal Twentieth-Century Fund. Filene wasthe millionaire retailer who was the major sponsor of the legal activities ofhis friend and oft-time counselor, Louis D. Brandeis.As we can see from the case of Henry Bruere, after Yankee women pioneered inwelfare and social-work organizations, men began to follow suit. Thus, heavilyinfluenced by their stays at Hull House were the prominent journalist FrancisHackett; the distinguished historian and political scientist Charles A. Beard,who had also stayed at Toynbee House in London; the man who would become one ofthe most preeminent state-cartelists in American industry, Gerard Swope, head ofthe Morgans’ General Electric Company; and the man who would become one of themajor social and labor activists for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and eventuallythe Rockefellers’ man as Liberal Premier of Canada for many years, William LyonMackenzie King.But perhaps the most important of the male social workers who became prominentin the New Deal was the man who became Roosevelt’s Brain Truster, Secretary ofCommerce, and eventually the shadowy virtual (if unofficial) Secretary of State,Harry Lloyd Hopkins (b. 1890). Hopkins, along with Eleanor Roosevelt, might beconsidered the leading statist social worker and activist of the 1880s cohort,the generation after the 1860s founders.Hopkins was born in Iowa, the son of a harness maker who later operated ageneral store. Following in the Yankee pietist social gospel mold, Hopkins’sCanadian mother, Anna Pickett Hopkins, was a gospel teacher and had becomepresident of the Methodist Home Mission Society of Iowa. Hopkins graduated fromGrinnell College in Iowa in 1912 in the social sciences. Moving to New York,Hopkins promptly married the first of three wives, the Jewish heiress EthelGross. Hopkins plunged into the settlement-house movement, becoming a residentof the Christodora House in New York before his marriage. He then went to workfor the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP) and became aprotégé of the general director of the AICP, John Adams Kingsbury (b. 1876).Kingsbury, no relation to the wealthy Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, had been bornin rural Kansas to a father who became a socialist high school principal inSeattle. Kingsbury, on graduation from Teachers College, Columbia, in 1909, wentinto professional social work.During the Reform Administration of New York Mayor John Purroy Mitchell,Kingsbury became Commissioner of Public Charities in New York, and Hopkins wasexecutive secretary of the Board of Child Welfare, serving on the Board togetherwith such rising social-reform luminaries as Henry Bruere, Molly Dewson, andFrances Perkins.From 1917 to 1922, Hopkins administered the Red Cross in the South, returning toNew York to become assistant director of the AICP, while Kingsbury became CEO ofthe highly influential Milbank Fund, which financed many medical and healthprojects, and was in the Rockefeller orbit. Kingsbury funded a major project forthe New York Tuberculosis Association after Hopkins became its director in 1924.Kingsbury became more and more openly radical, praising to the skies the allegedmedical achievements of the Soviet Union and agitating for compulsory healthinsurance in the United States. Kingsbury became such an outspoken agitatoragainst the American Medical Association that the AMA threatened a boycott ofBorden’s milk (the major business of the Milbank family), and succeeded ingetting Kingsbury fired in 1935. But not to worry; Harry Hopkins promptly madehis old friend Kingsbury a consultant to Hopkins’s make-work Works ProgressAdministration.How did Harry Hopkins rise from being a settlement-house worker to one of themost-powerful people in the New Deal? Part of the answer was his closefriendship with W. Averill Harriman, scion of the Harriman family, hisfriendship with John Hertz, partner of the powerful investment-banking firm ofLehman Brothers; and his association with the rising political leader of thepowerful Rockefeller family, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller. Indeed, when Hopkinswas made Secretary of Commerce in the New Deal, he offered the AssistantSecretary post to Nelson Rockefeller, who turned it down.7. THE ROCKEFELLERS AND SOCIAL SECURITYThe Rockefellers and their intellectual and technocratic entourage were, indeed,central to the New Deal. In a deep sense, in fact, the New Deal itselfconstituted a radical displacement of the Morgans, who had dominated thefinancial and economic politics of the 1920s, by a coalition led by theRockefellers, the Harrimans, Kuhn-Loeb, and the Lehman Brothers investmentbanking firms.[35] [part0018.html#fn35] The Business Advisory Committee of theDepartment of Commerce, for example, which proved highly influential in drawingup New Deal measures, was dominated by the scion of the Harriman family, W.Averill Harriman, and by such Rockefeller satraps as Walter Teagle, head ofStandard Oil of New Jersey. Here we have space to trace only the influence ofthe Rockefellers, allied with the Wisconsin progressives and the graduates ofthe settlement houses, in creating and imposing on America the Social SecuritySystem. Here, too, was the end product of a gradual but sure process ofsecularization of the messianic ideal of the postmillennial pietists. Perhaps itis only fitting that a movement that began with postmillennial Yankee harridansgoing out into the streets and trying to destroy saloons would conclude withWisconsin social scientists, technocrats, and Rockefeller-driven expertsmanipulating the levers of political power to bring about a top-down revolutionin the form of the welfare state.[36] [part0018.html#fn36]Social Security began in 1934 when President Franklin Roosevelt commissioned atriad of his top officials to select the membership of a Committee on EconomicSecurity (CES), which would draw up the legislation for the Social Securitysystem. The three officials were Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, Director ofthe Federal Emergency Relief Administration Harry Hopkins, and Secretary ofAgriculture Henry A. Wallace. The most important of this triad was Perkins,whose department came closest to jurisdiction over social security, and whopresented the administration’s viewpoints at Congressional hearings. Perkins andthe others decided to entrust the all-important task to Arthur Altmeyer, aCommons disciple at Wisconsin who had been secretary of the Wisconsin IndustrialCommission and had administered Wisconsin’s system of unemployment relief. WhenRoosevelt imposed the corporatist collectivist National Recovery Administration(NRA) in 1933, Altmeyer was made director of the NRA Labor Compliance Division.Corporatist businessmen heartily approved of Altmeyer’s performance on the task,notably Marion Folsom, head of Eastman Kodak, and one of the leading members ofthe Business Advisory Council.Altmeyer’s first choice to become chairman of the CES was none other than Dr.Bryce Stewart, director of research for the Industrial Relations Councilors(IRC). The IRC had been set up in the early 1920s by the Rockefellers,specifically John D., Jr., in charge of ideology and philanthropy for theRockefeller empire. The IRC was the flagship scholarly and activist outfit topromote a new form of corporatist labor-management cooperation, as well aspromoting pro-union and pro-welfare-state policies in industry and government.The IRC also set up influential Industrial Relations departments in Ivy Leagueuniversities, notably Princeton.Bryce Stewart, however, was hesitant about so openly taking charge of the SocialSecurity effort on behalf of the IRC and the Rockefellers. He preferred toremain behind the scenes, do advisory consulting to the CES, and co-direct astudy of unemployment insurance for the Council.Turned down by Stewart, Altmeyer turned to his successor as secretary of theWisconsin Industrial Commission, Commons disciple Edwin E. Witte. Witte becameExecutive Secretary of the CES, with the task of appointing the other members.At the suggestion of FDR, Altmeyer consulted with powerful members of the BAC,namely Swope, Teagle, and John Raskob of DuPont and General Motors, about themakeup and policies of the CES.Altmeyer and Witte also prepared names for FDR to select an Advisory Council tothe CES, consisting of employer, union, and “citizen” members. In addition toSwope, Folsom, and Teagle, the Advisory Council included two other powerfulcorporatist businessmen. The first, Morris Leeds, was president of Leeds &Northrup, and a member of the corporate, pro-union, pro-welfare-state AmericanAssociation for Labor Legislation. The second, Sam Lewisohn, was vice presidentof Miami Copper Company, and former president of the AALL. Selected to head theAdvisory Council was an academic front man, the much beloved Southern liberal,Frank Graham, president of the University of North Carolina.Altmeyer and Witte appointed as the members of the key Technical Board of theCES three distinguished experts, Murray Webb Latimer, J. Douglas Brown, andBarbara Nachtried Armstrong, who was the first female law professor at theUniversity of California at Berkeley. All three were IRC affiliates, and Latimerand Brown were, indeed, eminent members of the Rockefeller-IRC network. Latimer,chairman of the Railroad Retirement Board, was a long-time employee of the IRC,and had compiled the IRC’s study of industrial pensions, as well as havinghammered out the details of the Railroad Retirement Act. Latimer was a member ofthe AALL and helped administer insurance and pension plans for Standard Oil ofNew Jersey, Standard Oil of Ohio, and Standard Oil of California.J. Douglas Brown was head of Princeton’s IRC-created Industrial RelationsDepartment and was the point man for the CES in designing the old-age pensionplan for Social Security. Brown, along with the big-business members of theAdvisory Council, was particularly adamant that no employers escape the taxesfor the old-age pension scheme. Brown was frankly concerned that small businessnot escape the cost-raising consequences of these social security taxobligations. In this way, big businesses, who were already voluntarily providingcostly old-age pensions to their employees, could use the federal government toforce their small-business competitors into paying for similar, costly,programs. Thus, Brown explained, in his testimony before the Senate FinanceCommittee in 1935, that the great boon of the employer “contribution” to old-agepensions is that> it makes uniform throughout industry a minimum cost of providing old-age> security and protects the more liberal employer now providing pensions from> the competition of the employer who otherwise fires the old person without a> pension when superannuated. It levels up cost of old-age protection on both> the progressive employer and the unprogressive employer.[37]> [part0018.html#fn37]In other words, the legislation deliberately penalizes the lower cost,“unprogressive,” employer and cripples him by artificially raising his costscompared to the larger employer. Also injured, of course, are the consumers andthe taxpayers who are forced to pay for this largess.It is no wonder, then, that the bigger businesses almost all backed the SocialSecurity scheme to the hilt, while it was attacked by such associations of smallbusiness as the National Metal Trades Association, the Illinois ManufacturingAssociation, and the National Association of Manufacturers. By 1939, only 17% ofAmerican businesses favored repeal of the Social Security Act, while not one bigbusiness firm supported repeal.Big business, indeed, collaborated enthusiastically with social security. Whenthe Social Security Board faced the formidable task of establishing 26 millionaccounts for individuals, it consulted with the BAC, and Marion Folsom helpedplan the creation of regional SSB centers. The BAC got the Board to hire thedirector of the Industrial Bureau of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce toserve as head registrar, and J. Douglas Brown was rewarded for his services bybecoming chairman of the new, expanded Advisory Council for the Social SecurityAdministration.The American Association for Labor Legislation was particularly important indeveloping the Social Security system. This leftist social-welfare outfit,founded by Commons and headed for decades by his student John B. Andrews, wasfinanced by Rockefeller, Morgan, and other wealthy corporate liberal financialand industrial interests. The AALL was the major developer of disability andhealth insurance proposals during the 1920s, and then in 1930 turned to work onmodel state bills for unemployment insurance. In 1932, Wisconsin adopted theAALL’s plan and, under the force of AALL lobbying, the Democratic Partyincorporated it into its platform. In developing Social Security, key CESTechnical Board and Advisory Council posts were staffed with AALL members. Notonly that, but in early 1934, Secretary Perkins asked none other than PaulRauschenbush, the AALL’s Washington lobbyist, to draft a bill for SocialSecurity which became the basis for further discussions in the CES. The AALL wasalso closely associated with Florence Kelley’s National Consumers League.Paul Rauschenbusch had a fascinating pedigree in his own right. Paul was the sonof the leading Social-Gospel Baptist minister Walter Rauschenbusch. Paul studiedunder John R. Commons and was the principle author of the Wisconsin unemploymentinsurance law. There was even more of a progressive cast to Rauschenbusch, forhe married none other than Elizabeth Brandeis, daughter of the famed progressivejurist. Elizabeth also studied under Commons and received a Ph.D. fromWisconsin. What’s more, she was also a close friend of the Marxist FlorenceKelley and helped edit her aunt Josephine Goldmark’s loving biography of Kelley.Elizabeth also helped write the Wisconsin unemployment compensation law. Shetaught economics at Wisconsin, rising to the post of full professor.We can conclude by noting, with historian Irwin Yellowitz, that all these reformorganizations were dominated and funded by “a small group of wealthy patricians,professional men, and social workers. Wealthy women, including some from NewYork society, were indispensable to the financing and staffing.”[38][part0018.html#fn38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in Journal of Libertarian Studies 12, no. 2 (1996):193–232.[1] [part0018.html#ft1] Harold Wilensky put it baldly and succinctly: “Economicgrowth is the ultimate cause of welfare state development.” Harold Wilensky, TheWelfare State and Equality (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), p.24.[2] [part0018.html#ft2] Thus, Flora and Alber find no correlation between levelsof industrialization and social insurance programs of 12 European nationsbetween the 1880s and the 1920s.

It was a “war collectivism,” a totally plannedeconomy run largely by big-business interests through the instrumentality of thecentral government, which served as the model, the precedent, and theinspiration for state-corporate capitalism for the remainder of the 20thcentury. That inspiration and precedent emerged not only in the United Statesbut also in the war economies of the major combatants of World War I. Warcollectivism showed the big-business interests of the Western world that it waspossible to shift radically from the previous, largely free-market, capitalismto a new order marked by strong government, and extensive and pervasivegovernment intervention and planning, for the purpose of providing a network ofsubsidies and monopolistic privileges to business, and especially to largebusiness, interests. In particular, the economy could be cartelized under theaegis of government, with prices raised and production fixed and restricted, inthe classic pattern of monopoly, and military and other government contractscould be channeled into the hands of favored corporate producers. Labor, whichhad been becoming increasingly rambunctious, could be tamed and bridled into theservice of this new, state-monopoly-capitalist order, through the device ofpromoting a suitably cooperative trade unionism, and by bringing the willingunion leaders into the planning system as junior partners.In many ways, the new order was a striking reversion to old-fashionedmercantilism, with its aggressive imperialism and nationalism, its pervasivemilitarism, and its giant network of subsidies and monopolistic privileges tolarge business interests. In its 20th-century form, of course, the NewMercantilism was industrial rather than mercantile, since the industrialrevolution had intervened to make manufacturing and industry the dominanteconomic form. But there was a more significant difference in the NewMercantilism. The original mercantilism had been brutally frank in its classrule, and in its scorn for the average worker and consumer.[1][part0019.html#fn1] Instead, the new dispensation cloaked the new form of rulein the guise of promotion of the overall national interest of the welfare of theworkers through the new representation for labor, and of the common good of allcitizens. Hence the importance, for providing a much-needed popular legitimacyand support, of the new ideology of 20th-century liberalism, which sanctionedand glorified the new order. In contrast to the older laissez-faire liberalismof the previous century, the new liberalism gained popular sanction for the newsystem by proclaiming that it differed radically from the old, exploitativemercantilism in its advancement of the welfare of the whole society. And inreturn for this ideological buttressing by the new “corporate” liberals, the newsystem furnished the liberals the prestige, the income, and the power that camewith posts for the concrete, detailed planning of the system as well as forideological propaganda on its behalf.For their part, the liberal intellectuals acquired not only prestige and amodicum of power in the new order, they also achieved the satisfaction ofbelieving that this new system of government intervention was able to transcendthe weaknesses and the social conflicts that they saw in the two majoralternatives: laissez-faire capitalism or proletarian, Marxian socialism. Theintellectuals saw the new order as bringing harmony and cooperation to allclasses on behalf of the general welfare, under the aegis of big government. Inthe liberal view, the new order provided a middle way, a “vital center” for thenation, as contrasted to the divisive “extremes” of left and right.1. BIG BUSINESS AND WAR COLLECTIVISMWe have no space here to dwell on the extensive role of big business andbusiness interests in getting the United States into World War I. The extensiveeconomic ties of the large business community with England and France, throughexport orders and through loans to the Allies—especially those underwritten bythe politically powerful J.P. Morgan & Co. (which also served as agent to theBritish and French governments)—allied to the boom brought about by domestic andAllied military orders, all played a leading role in bringing the United Statesinto the war. Furthermore, virtually the entire eastern business communitysupported the drive toward war.[2] [part0019.html#fn2]Apart from the role of big business in pushing America down the road to war,business was equally enthusiastic about the extensive planning and economicmobilization that the war would clearly entail. Thus, an early enthusiast forwar mobilization was the United States Chamber of Commerce, which had been aleading champion of industrial cartelization under the aegis of the federalgovernment since its formation in 1912. The chamber’s monthly, The Nation’sBusiness, foresaw in mid-1916 that a mobilized economy would bring about asharing of power and responsibility between government and business. And thechairman of the U.S. chamber’s executive committee on national defense wrote tothe du Ponts, at the end of 1916, of his expectation that “this munitionsquestion would seem to be the greatest opportunity to foster the new spirit” ofcooperation between government and industry.[3] [part0019.html#fn3]The first organization to move toward economic mobilization for war was theCommittee on Industrial Preparedness, which in 1916 grew out of the IndustrialPreparedness Committee of the Naval Consulting Board, a committee of industrialconsultants to the navy dedicated to considering the ramifications of anexpanding American navy. Characteristically, the new CIP was a closely blendedpublic-private organization, officially an arm of the federal government butfinanced solely by private contributions. Moreover, the industrialist members ofthe committee, working patriotically without fee, were thereby able to retaintheir private positions and incomes. Chairman of the CIP, and a dedicatedenthusiast for industrial mobilization, was Howard E. Coffin, vice president ofthe important Hudson Motor Co. of Detroit. Under Coffin’s direction, the CIPorganized a national inventory of thousands of industrial facilities formunitions making. To propagandize for this effort, christened “industrialpreparedness,” Coffin was able to mobilize the American Press Association, theAssociated Advertising Clubs of the World, the august New York Times, and thegreat bulk of American industry.[4] [part0019.html#fn4]The CIP was succeeded, in late 1916, by the fully governmental Council ofNational Defense, whose advisory commission—largely consisting of privateindustrialists—was to become its actual operating agency. (The council properconsisted of several members of the cabinet.) President Wilson announced thepurpose of the CND as organizing “the whole industrial mechanism ... in the mosteffective way.” Wilson found the council particularly valuable because it “opensup a new and direct channel of communication and cooperation between businessand scientific men and all departments of the Government ...”[5][part0019.html#fn5] He also hailed the personnel of the council’s advisorycommission as marking “the entrance of the nonpartisan engineer and professionalman into American governmental affairs” on an unprecedented scale. Thesemembers, declared the president grandiloquently, were to serve without pay,“efficiency being their sole object and Americanism their only motive.”[6][part0019.html#fn6]Exulting over the new CND, Howard Coffin wrote to the du Ponts in December, 1916that “it is our hope that we may lay the foundation for that closely knitstructure, industrial, civil and military, which every thinking American hascome to realize is vital to the future life of this country, in peace and incommerce, no less than in possible war.”[7] [part0019.html#fn7]Particularly influential in establishing the CND was Secretary of the TreasuryWilliam Gibbs McAdoo, son-in-law of the president and formerly promoter of theHudson and Manhattan Railroad and associate of the Ryan interests in WallStreet.[8] [part0019.html#fn8] Head of the advisory commission was Walter S.Gifford, who had been one of the leaders of the Coffin Committee and had come togovernment from his post as chief statistician of the American Telephone andTelegraph Co., a giant monopoly enterprise in the Morgan ambit. The other“nonpartisan” members were Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore and OhioRailroad, Wall Street financier Bernard M. Baruch, Howard E. Coffin, JuliusRosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Co., Samuel Gompers, president of theAF of L, and one scientist and one leading surgeon.Months before American entry into the war, the advisory commission of the CNDdesigned what was to become the entire system of purchasing war supplies, thesystem of food control, and censorship of the press. It was the advisorycommission that met with the delighted representatives of the various branchesof industry, and told the businessmen to form themselves into committees forsale of their products to the government, and for the fixing of the prices ofthese products. Daniel Willard was, unsurprisingly, put in charge of dealingwith the railroads, Howard Coffin with munitions and manufacturing, BernardBaruch with raw materials and minerals, Julius Rosenwald with supplies, andSamuel Gompers with labor. The idea of establishing committees of the variousindustries, “to get their resources together,” began with Bernard Baruch. CNDcommodity committees, in their turn, invariably consisted of the leadingindustrialists in each field; these committees would then negotiate with thecommittees appointed by industry.[9] [part0019.html#fn9]At the recommendation of the advisory commission, Herbert Clark Hoover was namedhead of the new Food Administration. By the end of March, 1917, the CNDappointed a Purchasing Board, to coordinate government’s purchases fromindustry. Chairman of this board, the name of which was soon changed to theGeneral Munitions Board, was Frank A. Scott, a well-known Cleveland manufacturerand president of Warner & Swasey Co.Yet centralized mobilization was proceeding but slowly through the tangle ofbureaucracy, and the United States Chamber of Commerce urged Congress that thedirector of the CND “should be given power and authority in the economic fieldanalogous to that of the chief of state in the military field.”[10][part0019.html#fn10] Finally, in early July, the raw materials, munitions, andsupplies departments were brought together under the new War Industries Board,with Scott as chairman, the board that was to become the central agency forcollectivism in World War I. The functions of the WIB soon became thecoordinating of purchases, the allocation of commodities, and the fixing ofprices and priorities in production.Administrative problems beset the WIB, however, and a satisfactory “autocrat”was sought to rule the entire economy as chairman of the new organization. Thewilling autocrat was finally discovered in the person of Bernard Baruch in earlyMarch, 1918. With the selection of Baruch, urged strongly on President Wilson bySecretary McAdoo, war collectivism had achieved its final form.[11][part0019.html#fn11] Baruch’s credentials for the task were unimpeachable; anearly supporter of the drive toward war, Baruch had presented a scheme forindustrial war mobilization to President Wilson as early as 1915.The WIB developed a vast apparatus that connected to the specific industriesthrough commodity divisions largely staffed by the industries themselves. Thehistorian of the WIB, himself one of its leaders, exulted that the WIB hadestablished> a system of concentration of commerce, industry, and all the powers of> government that was without compare among all the other nations. ... It was so> interwoven with the supply departments of the army and navy, of the Allies,> and with other departments of the Government that, while it was an entity of> its own ... its decisions and its acts ... were always based on a conspectus> of the whole situation. At the same time, through the commodity divisions and> sections in contact with responsible committees of the commodities dealt with,> the War Industries Board extended its antennae into the innermost recesses of> industry. Never before was there such a focusing of knowledge of the vast> field of American industry, commerce, and transportation. Never was there such> an approach to omniscience in the business affairs of a continent.[12]> [part0019.html#fn12]Big-business leaders permeated the WIB structure from the board itself down tothe commodity sections. Thus, Vice Chairman Alexander Legge came fromInternational Harvester Co.; businessman Robert S. Brookings was the major forcein insisting on price fixing; George N. Peek, in charge of finished products,had been vice president of Deere & Co., a leading farm-equipment manufacturer.Robert S. Lovett, in charge of priorities, was chairman of the board of UnionPacific Railroad, and J. Leonard Replogle, Steel Administrator, had beenpresident of the American Vanadium Co. Outside of the direct WIB structure,Daniel Willard of the Baltimore & Ohio was in charge of the nation’s railroads,and big businessman Herbert C. Hoover was the “Food Czar.”In the granting of war contracts, there was no nonsense about competitivebidding. Competition in efficiency and cost was brushed aside, and theindustry-dominated WIB handed out contracts as it saw fit.Any maverick individualistic firm that disliked the mandates and orders of theWIB was soon crushed between the coercion wielded by government and thecollaborating opprobrium of his organized business colleagues. Thus, GrosvenorClarkson writes,> Individualistic American industrialists were aghast when they realized that> industry had been drafted, much as manpower had been. ... Business willed its> own domination, forged its bonds, and policed its own subjection. There were> bitter and stormy protests here and there, especially from those industries> that were curtailed or suspended. ... [But] the rents in the garment of> authority were amply filled by the docile and cooperative spirit of industry.> The occasional obstructor fled from the mandates of the Board only to find> himself ostracized by his fellows in industry.[13] [part0019.html#fn13]One of the most important instrumentalities of wartime collectivism was theConservation Division of the WIB, an agency again consisting largely of leadersin manufacturing. The Conservation Division had begun as the Commercial EconomyBoard of the CND, the brainchild of its first chairman, Chicago businessman A.W.Shaw. The Board, or Division, would suggest industrial economies and encouragethe industry concerned to establish cooperative regulations. The board’sregulations were supposedly “voluntary,” a voluntarism enforced by “thecompulsion of trade opinion—which automatically policed the observance of therecommendations.” For “a practice adopted by the overwhelming consent and eveninsistence of ... [a man’s] fellows, especially when it bears the label ofpatriotic service in a time of emergency, is not lightly to be disregarded.”[14][part0019.html#fn14]In this way, in the name of wartime “conservation,” the Conservation Divisionset out to rationalize, standardize, and cartelize industry in a way that would,hopefully, continue permanently after the end of the war. Arch W. Shaw summed upthe division’s task as follows: to drastically reduce the number of styles,sizes, etc., of the products of industry, to eliminate various styles andvarieties, and to standardize sizes and measures. That this ruthless andthoroughgoing suppression of competition in industry was not thought of as apurely wartime measure is made clear in this passage by Grosvenor Clarkson:> The World War was a wonderful school. ... It showed us how so many things may> be bettered that we are at a loss where to begin with permanent utilization of> what we know. The Conservation Division alone showed that merely to strip from> trade and industry the lumber of futile custom and the encrustation of useless> variety would return a good dividend on the world’s capital. ... It is,> perhaps, too much to hope that there will be any general gain in time of peace> from the triumphant experiment of the Conservation Division. Yet now the world> needs to economize as much as in war.[15] [part0019.html#fn15]Looking forward to future cartelization, Clarkson declared that such peacetime“economizing ... implies such a close and sympathetic affiliation of competitiveindustries as is hardly possible under the decentralization of business that iscompelled by our antitrust statutes.”Bernard Baruch’s biographer summarized the lasting results of the compulsory“conservation” and standardization as follows:> Wartime conservation had reduced styles, varieties, and colors of clothing. It> had standardized sizes. ... It had outlawed 250 different types of plow models> in the U.S., to say nothing of 755 types of drills ... mass production and> mass distribution had become the law of the land. ... This, then, would be the> goal of the next quarter of the twentieth century: “To Standardize American> Industry”; to make of wartime necessity a matter of peacetime advantage.[16]> [part0019.html#fn16]Not only the Conservation Division, but the entire structure of wartimecollectivism and cartelization constituted a vision to business and governmentof a future peacetime economy. As Clarkson frankly put it,> It is little wonder that the men who dealt with the industries of a nation ...> meditated with a sort of intellectual contempt on the huge hit-and-miss> confusion of peacetime industry, with its perpetual cycle of surfeit and> dearth and its internal attempt at adjustment after the event. From their> meditations arose dreams of an ordered economic world. ...> > They conceived of America as “commodity sectioned” for the control of world> trade. They beheld the whole trade of the world carefully computed and> registered in Washington, requirements noted, American resources on call, the> faucets opened or closed according to the circumstances. In a word, a national> mind and will confronting international trade and keeping its own house in> business order.[17] [part0019.html#fn17]Heart and soul of the mechanism of control of industry by the WIB were its60-odd commodity sections, committees supervising the various groups ofcommodities, which were staffed almost exclusively by businessmen from therespective industries. Furthermore, these committees dealt with over threehundred “war service committees” of industry appointed by the respectiveindustrial groupings under the aegis of the Chamber of Commerce of the UnitedStates. It is no wonder that in this cozy atmosphere, there was a great deal ofharmony between business and government. As Clarkson admiringly described it,> Businessmen wholly consecrated to government service, but full of> understanding of the problems of industry, now faced businessmen wholly> representative of industry ... but sympathetic with the purpose of> government.[18] [part0019.html#fn18]And:> The commodity sections were business operating Government business for the> common good. ... The war committees of industry knew, understood, and believed> in the commodity chiefs. They were of the same piece.[19] [part0019.html#fn19]All in all, Clarkson exulted that the commodity sections were “industrymobilized and drilled, responsive, keen, and fully staffed. They were militantand in serried ranks.”[20] [part0019.html#fn20]The Chamber of Commerce was particularly enthusiastic over the war servicecommittee system, a system that was to spur the trade association movement inpeacetime as well. Chamber president Harry A. Wheeler, vice president of theUnion Trust Co. of Chicago, declared that> Creation of the War Service Committees promises to furnish the basis for a> truly national organization of industry whose preparations and opportunities> are unlimited. ... The integration of business, the expressed aim of the> National Chamber, is in sight. War is the stern teacher that is driving home> the lesson of cooperative effort.[21] [part0019.html#fn21]The result of all this newfound harmony within each industry, and betweenindustry and government, was to “substitute cooperation for competition.”Competition for government orders was virtually nonexistent, and “competition inprice was practically done away with by Government action. Industry was for thetime in ... a golden age of harmony,” and freed from the menace of businesslosses.[22] [part0019.html#fn22]One of the crucial functions of wartime planning was price fixing, set in thefield of industrial commodities by the Price Fixing Committee of the WarIndustries Board. Beginning with such critical areas as steel and copper earlyin the war and then inexorably expanding to many other fields, the price fixingwas sold to the public as the fixing of maximum prices in order to protect thepublic against wartime inflation. In fact, however, the government set the pricein each industry at such a rate as to guarantee a “fair profit” to the high-costproducers, thereby conferring a large degree of privilege and high profits onthe lower-cost firms.[23] [part0019.html#fn23] Clarkson admitted that thissystem> was a tremendous invigoration of big business and hard on small business. The> large and efficient producers made larger profits than normally and many of> the smaller concerns fell below their customary returns.[24]> [part0019.html#fn24]But the higher-cost firms were largely content with their “fair profit”guarantee.The attitude of the Price-Fixing Committee was reflected in the statement of itsChairman, Robert S. Brookings, a retired lumber magnate, addressed to the nickelindustry: “We are not in an attitude of envying you your profits; we are more inthe attitude of justifying them if we can. That is the way we approach thesethings.”[25] [part0019.html#fn25]Typical of the price-fixing operation was the situation in the cotton textileindustry. Chairman Brookings reported in April, 1918, that the Cotton GoodsCommittee had decided to “get together in a friendly way” to try to “stabilizethe market.” Brookings appended the feeling of the larger cotton manufacturersthat it was better to fix a high long-run minimum price than to take fullshort-run advantage of the very high prices then in existence.[26][part0019.html#fn26]The general enthusiasm of the business world, and especially big business, forthe system of war collectivism can now be explained. The enthusiasm was aproduct of the resulting stabilization of prices, the ironing out of marketfluctuations, and the fact that prices were almost always set by mutual consentof government and the representatives of each industry. It is no wonder thatHarry A. Wheeler, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote inthe summer of 1917 that war “is giving business the foundation for the kind ofcooperative effort that alone can make the U.S. economically efficient.” Or thatthe head of American Telephone and Telegraph hailed the perfecting of a“coordination to ensure complete cooperation not only between the Government andthe companies, but between the companies themselves.” The wartime cooperativeplanning was working so well, in fact, opined the chairman of the board ofRepublic Iron and Steel in early 1918, that it should be continued in peacetimeas well.[27] [part0019.html#fn27]The vitally important steel industry is an excellent example of the workings ofwar collectivism. The hallmark of the closely knit control of the steel industrywas the close “cooperation” between government and industry, a cooperation inwhich Washington decided on broad policy, and then left it up to Judge ElbertGary, head of the leading steel producer, United States Steel, to implement thepolicy within the industry. Gary selected a committee representing the largeststeel producers to help him run the industry. A willing ally was present in J.Leonard Replogle, head of American Vanadium Co. and chief of the Steel Divisionof the WIB. Replogle shared the long-standing desire of Gary and the steelindustry for industrial cartelization and market stability under the aegis of afriendly federal government. Unsurprisingly, Gary was delighted with his newpowers in directing the steel industry and urged that he be given total power“to thoroughly mobilize and if necessary to commandeer.” And Iron Age, themagazine of the iron and steel industry, exulted that> it has apparently taken the most gigantic war in all history to give the idea> of cooperation any such place in the general economic program as the country’s> steel manufacturers sought to give it in their own industry nearly ten years> agowith the short-lived entente cordiale between Judge Gary and PresidentRoosevelt.[28] [part0019.html#fn28]It is true that wartime relations between government and steel companies weresometimes strained, but the strain and the tough threat of governmentcommandeering of resources was generally directed at smaller firms, such asCrucible Steel, which had stubbornly refused to accept government contracts.[29][part0019.html#fn29]In the steel industry, in fact, it was the big steelmakers—U.S. Steel,Bethlehem, Republic, etc.—who, early in the war, had first urged governmentprice fixing, and they had to prod a sometimes confused government to adopt whateventually became the government’s program. The main reason was that the bigsteel producers, happy at the enormous increase of steel prices in the market asa result of wartime demand, were anxious to stabilize the market at a high priceand thus ensure a long-run profit position for the duration of the war. Thegovernment-steel industry price-fixing agreement of September, 1917, wastherefore hailed by John A. Topping, president of Republic Steel, as follows:> The steel settlement will have a wholesome effect on the steel business> because the principle of cooperative-regulation has been established with> Government approval. Of course, present abnormal profits will be substantially> reduced but a runaway market condition has been prevented and prosperity> extended. ... Furthermore, stability in future values should be conserved.[30]> [part0019.html#fn30]Furthermore, the large steel firms were happy to use the fixed prices as arationale for imposing controls and stability on wages, which were alsobeginning to rise. The smaller steel manufacturers, on the other hand, oftenwith higher costs, and who had not been as prosperous before the war, opposedprice fixing because they wished to take full advantage of the short-run profitbonanza brought about by the war.[31] [part0019.html#fn31]Under this regime, the steel industry achieved the highest level of profits inits history, averaging 25% per year for the two years of war. Some of thesmaller steel companies, benefiting from their lower total capitalization, didalmost twice as well.[32] [part0019.html#fn32]The most thoroughgoing system of price controls during the war was enforced notby the WIB but by the separate Food Administration, over which Herbert ClarkHoover presided as “Food Czar.” The official historian of wartime price controljustly wrote that the food control program “was the most important measure forcontrolling prices which the United States ... had ever taken.”[33][part0019.html#fn33]Herbert Hoover accepted his post shortly after American entry into the war, butonly on the condition that he alone have full authority over food, unhampered byboards or commissions. The Food Administration was established without legalauthorization, and then a bill backed by Hoover was put through Congress to givethe system the full force of law. Hoover was also given the power to requisition“necessaries,” to seize plants for government operation, and to regulate orprohibit exchanges.The key to the Food Administration’s system of control was a vast network oflicensing. Instead of direct control over food, the FA was given the absolutepower to issue licenses for any and all divisions of the food industry, and toset the conditions for keeping the license. Every dealer, manufacturer,distributor, and warehouser of food commodities was required by Hoover tomaintain its federal license.A notable feature introduced by Hoover in his reign as Food Czar was themobilization of a vast network of citizen volunteers as a mass of eagerparticipants in enforcing his decrees. Thus, Herbert Hoover was perhaps thefirst American politician to realize the potential—in gaining mass acceptanceand in enforcing government decrees—in the mobilizing of masses through atorrent of propaganda to serve as volunteer aides to the government bureaucracy.Mobilization proceeded to the point of inducing the public to brand as a virtualmoral leper anyone dissenting from Mr. Hoover’s edicts. Thus> The basis of all ... control exercised by the Food Administration was the> educational work which preceded and accompanied its measures of conservation> and regulation. Mr. Hoover was committed thoroughly to the idea that the most> effective method to control foods was to set every man, woman, and child in> the country at the business of saving food. ... The country was literally> strewn with millions of pamphlets and leaflets designed to educate the people> to the food situation. No war board at Washington was advertised as widely as> the U.S. Food Administration. There were Food Administration insignia for the> coat lapel, store window, the restaurant, the train, and the home. A real> stigma was placed upon the person who was not loyal to Food Administration> edicts through pressure by the schools, churches, women’s clubs, public> libraries, merchants’ associations, fraternal organizations, and other social> groups.[34] [part0019.html#fn34]The method by which the Food Administration imposed price control was itsrequirement that its licensees should receive “a reasonable margin of profit.”This “reasonable margin” was interpreted as a margin over and above eachproducer’s costs, and this cost plus “reasonable profit” for each dealer becamethe rule of price control. The program was touted to the public as a means ofkeeping profits and food prices down. Although the administration certainlywished to stabilize prices, the goal was also and more importantly to cartelize.Industry and government worked together to make sure that individual maverickcompetitors did not get out of line; prices in general were to be set at a levelto guarantee a “reasonable” profit to everyone. The goal was not lower prices,but uniform, stabilized, noncompetitive prices for all. The goal was far more tokeep prices up than to keep them down. Indeed, any overly greedy competitor whotried to increase his profits above prewar levels by cutting his prices wasdealt with most severely by the Food Administration.Let us consider two of the most important food-control programs during World WarI: wheat and sugar. Wheat price control, the most important program, came in thewake of wartime demand, which had pushed wheat prices up very rapidly to theirhighest level in the history of the United States. Thus, wheat increased by onedollar a bushel in the course of two months at the start of the war, reachingthe unheard of price of three dollars a bushel. Control came in the wake ofagitation that government must step in to thwart “speculators” by fixing maximumprices on wheat. Yet, under pressure by the agriculturists, the governmentprogram fixed by statute, not maximum prices for wheat but minima; the FoodControl Act of 1917 fixed a minimum price of two dollars a bushel for the nextyear’s wheat crop. Not content with this special subsidy, the presidentproceeded to raise the minimum to $2.26 a bushel in mid-1918, a figure that wasthen the precise market price for wheat. This increased minimum effectivelyfixed the price of wheat for the duration of the war. Thus, the government madesure that the consumers could not possibly benefit from any fall in wheatprices.To enforce the artificially high price of wheat, Herbert Hoover established theGrain Corporation, “headed by practical grain men,” which purchased the bulk ofthe wheat crop in the United States at the “fair price” and then resold the cropto the nation’s flour mills at the same price. To keep the millers happy, theGrain Corporation guaranteed them against any possible losses from unsold stocksof wheat or flour. Moreover, each mill was guaranteed that its relative positionin the flour industry would be maintained throughout the war. In this way, theflour industry was successfully cartelized through the instrument of government.Those few mills who balked at the cartel arrangement were dealt with handily bythe Food Administration; as Garrett put it: “their operations ... werereasonably well controlled ... by the license requirements.”[35][part0019.html#fn35]The excessively high prices of wheat and flour also meant artificially highcosts to the bakers. They, in turn, were taken under the cozy cartel umbrella bybeing required, in the name of “conservation,” to mix inferior products withwheat flour at a fixed ratio. Each baker was of course delighted to comply witha requirement that he make inferior products, which he knew was also beingenforced upon his competitors. Competition was also curtailed by the FoodAdministration’s compulsory standardization of the sizes of bread loaves, and byprohibiting price cutting through discounts or rebates to particularcustomers—the classic path toward the internal breakup of any cartel.[36][part0019.html#fn36]In the particular case of sugar, there was a much more sincere effort to keepdown prices—due to the fact that the United States was largely an importerrather than a producer of sugar. Herbert Hoover and the Allied governments dulyformed an International Sugar Committee, which undertook to buy all of theircountries’ sugar, largely from Cuba, at an artificially low price, and then toallocate the raw sugar to the various refiners. Thus, the Allied governmentsfunctioned as a giant buying cartel to lower the price of their refiners’ rawmaterial.Herbert Hoover instigated the plan for the International Sugar Committee, andthe U.S. government appointed the majority of the five-man committee. AsChairman of the committee, Hoover selected Earl Babst, president of the powerfulAmerican Sugar Refining Co., and the other American members also representedrefiner interests. The ISC promptly fixed a sharp reduction of the price ofsugar: lowering the New York price of Cuban raw sugar from its high market priceof six and three-quarter cents per pound in the summer of 1917 to six cents perpound. When the Cubans understandably balked at this artificially forced pricereduction of their cash crop, the United States State Department and the FoodAdministration collaborated to coerce the Cuban government into agreement.Somehow, the Cubans were unable to obtain import licenses for needed wheat andcoal from the United States Food Administration, and the result was a severeshortage of bread, flour, and coal in Cuba. Finally, the Cubans capitulated inmid-January, 1918, and the import licenses from the United States were rapidlyforthcoming.[37] [part0019.html#fn37] Cuba also induced to prohibit all sugarexports except to the International Sugar Committee.Apparently, Mr. Babst ensured an extra bonus to his American Sugar RefiningCompany, for, shortly, officials of competing American refineries were totestify before Congress that this company had particularly profited from theactivities of the International Sugar Committee and from the price that it fixedon Cuban sugar.[38] [part0019.html#fn38]Although the American government pursued with great diligence the goal ofpushing down raw material prices for U.S. refiners, it also realized that itcould not force down the price of raw sugar too low, since the government had toconsider the marginal U.S. cane and beet-sugar producers, who had to receivetheir duly appointed “fair return.” Jointly to harmonize and subsidize both thesugar refiners and the sugar growers in the United States, Mr. Hooverestablished a Sugar Equalization Board that would simultaneously keep the priceof sugar low to Cuba while keeping it high enough for the American producers.The Board accomplished this feat by buying the Cuban sugar at the fixed lowprice and then reselling the crop to the refiners at a higher price to cover theAmerican producers.[39] [part0019.html#fn39]The result of the artificially low prices for sugar was, inevitably, to create asevere sugar shortage, by reducing supplies and by stimulating an excessivepublic consumption. The result was that sugar consumption was then severelyrestricted by federal rationing of sugar.It is not surprising that the food industries were delighted with the wartimecontrol program. Expressing the spirit of the entire war-collectivist regime,Herbert Hoover, in the words of Paul Garrett> maintained, as a cardinal policy from the beginning, a very close and intimate> contact with the trade. The men, whom he chose to head his various commodity> sections and responsible positions, were in a large measure tradesmen. ... The> determination of the policies of control within each branch of the food> industry was made in conference with the tradesmen of that branch. ... It> might be said ... that the framework of food control, as of raw material> control, was built upon agreements with the trade.

The industry itself was made to feel> responsible for the enforcement of all rules and regulations.[40]> [part0019.html#fn40]Also separate from the War Industries Board were the nation’s railroads, whichreceived the greatest single ministration of government dictation as compared toany other industry. The railroads, in fact, were seized and operated directly bythe federal government.As soon as the United States entered the war, the administration urged therailroads to unite as one in behalf of the war effort. The railroads weredelighted to comply and quickly formed what became known as the Railroads’ WarBoard, promising faithfully to pursue a goal that they had long sought inpeacetime: to cease competitive activities and to coordinate railroadoperations.[41] [part0019.html#fn41] Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore& Ohio Railroad and Bernard Baruch’s predecessor as head of the WIB, happilyreported that the railroads had agreed to vest their War Board with completeauthority to override individual railroad interests. Under its Chairman, FairfaxHarrison of the Southern Railroad, the War Board established a Committee on CarService to coordinate national car supplies. Aiding the coordination effort wasthe Interstate Commerce Commission, the longtime federal regulatory body for therailroads. Once again, the government-promoted monopoly was an inspiration tomany who were looking ahead to the peacetime economy. For several years therailroads had been agitating for “scientific management” as a means of achievinghigher rates from the ICC and a governmentally imposed cartelization, but theyhad been thwarted by the pressure of the organized shippers, the industrialusers of the railroads.But now even the shippers were impressed. Max Thelen, chairman of the CaliforniaRailroad Commission, president of the National Association of Railway andUtilities Commissions, and the leading spokesman for the organized shippers,agreed that the critical railroad problem was “duplication” and the “irrational”lack of complete inter-railroad coordination. And Senator Francis G. Newlands(D., Nev.), the most powerful congressman on railroad affairs as the chairman ofa joint committee on transportation regulation, opined that the wartimeexperience was “somewhat shattering our old views regarding antitrust laws.”[42][part0019.html#fn42]Soon, however, it became clear that the system of voluntary private coordinationwas not really working well. Traffic departments of individual roads persistedin competitive practices, the railroad brotherhood unions were persistentlydemanding substantial wage increases, and the railroads and organized shipperslocked horns over railroad demands for an across-the-board rate increase. Allgroups felt that regional coordination and overall efficiency would best beachieved by outright federal operation of the railroads. The shippers firstproposed the scheme as a method of achieving coordination and to forestallhigher freight rates; the unions seconded the plan in order to obtain wageincreases from the government, and the railroads cheerfully agreed whenPresident Wilson assured them that each road would be guaranteed its 1916/17profits—two years of unusually high profits for the railroad industry. With thefederal government offering to take on the headaches of wartime dislocation andmanagement, while granting the roads a very high guaranteed profit for doingnothing, why shouldn’t the railroads leap to agreement?The most enthusiastic administration proponent of federal operation of therailroads was Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo, a former New York railroadexecutive and close associate of the Morgan interests, who in turn were theleading underwriters and owners of railroad bonds. McAdoo was rewarded by beingnamed head of the United States Railroad Administration after Wilson seized therailroads on December 28, 1917.Federal rule by the Morgan-oriented McAdoo proved to be a bonanza for thenation’s railroads. Not only were the railroads now fully monopolized by directgovernment operation, but also the particular railroad executives now foundthemselves armed with the coercive power of the federal government. For McAdoochose as his immediate assistants a group of top railroad executives, and allrate-setting powers of the ICC were shifted to the railroad-dominated RailroadAdministration for the duration.[43] [part0019.html#fn43] The significance ofthe shift is that the railroads, although largely responsible for the inceptionand growth of the ICC as a cartelizing agency for the railroad industry, hadseen control of the ICC slip into the hands of the organized shippers in thedecade before the war. This meant that the railroads had found it very difficultto win freight rate increases from the ICC. But now the wartime federal controlof the railroads was shunting the shippers aside.[44] [part0019.html#fn44]McAdoo’s brazen appointment of railroad men to virtually all the leadingpositions in the Railroad Administration, to the virtual exclusion of shippersand academic economists, greatly angered the shippers, who had launched anintense barrage of criticism of the system by midsummer of 1918. This barragecame to a head when McAdoo increasingly turned the direction of the RA,including the appointment of regional directors, over to his principalassistant, railroad executive Walker D. Hines. Shippers and ICC commissionerscomplained that> railroad lawyers from the entire country descended on Washington, told their> troubles to other railroad lawyers serving on McAdoo’s staff, and were “told> to go into an adjoining room and dictate what orders they want.”[45]> [part0019.html#fn45]As in the case of the War Industries Board, the railroad executives used theircoercive governmental powers to deal a crippling blow to diversity andcompetition, on behalf of monopoly, in the name of “efficiency” andstandardization. Again, over the opposition of shippers, the RA ordered thecompulsory standardization of locomotive and equipment design, eliminated“duplicate” (i.e., competitive) passenger service and coal transportation, shutdown off-line traffic offices, and ordered the cessation of competitivesolicitation of freight by the railroads.All of these edicts reduced railroad services to the hapless shippers. Therewere still other coerced reductions of service. One ended the shippers’privileges of specifying freight routes—and thereby of specifying the cheapestroutes for shipping their goods. Another upset the peacetime practice of makingthe railroads liable for losses and damages to shipments; instead, the entireburden of proof was placed on the shippers. Another RA ruling—the “sailing dayplan”—ordered freight cars to remain in their terminals until filled, thussharply curtailing service to small-town shippers.The granting of absolute power to the railroad-dominated RA was cemented by theFederal Control Act of March, 1918, which ex post facto legalized the illegalfederal takeover. Working closely with railroad lobbyists, the RA, backed by thefull support of President Wilson, was able to drive through Congress thetransfer of rate-making powers to itself from the ICC. Furthermore, all powerwas taken away from the invariably shipper-dominated state railroad commissions.The RA hastened to exercise its rate-setting powers, announcing freight rateincreases of 25% across the board in the spring of 1918—an act that permanentlycemented shipper hostility to the system of federal operation. To add insult toinjury, the new higher rates were set without any public hearings orconsultation with other agencies or interests involved.2. INTELLECTUALS AND THE LEGACY OF WAR COLLECTIVISMHistorians have generally treated the economic planning of World War I as anisolated episode dictated by the requirements of the day and having littlefurther significance. But, on the contrary, the war collectivism served as aninspiration and as a model for a mighty army of forces destined to forge thehistory of 20th-century America. For big business, the wartime economy was amodel of what could be achieved in national coordination and cartelization, instabilizing production, prices, and profits, in replacing old-fashionedcompetitive laissez-faire by a system that they could broadly control and thatwould harmonize the claims of various powerful economic groups. It was a systemthat had already abolished much competitive diversity in the name ofstandardization. The wartime economy especially galvanized such business leadersas Bernard Baruch and Herbert Hoover, who would promote the cooperative“association” of business trade groups as secretary of commerce during the1920s, an associationism that paved the way for the cooperative statism ofFranklin Roosevelt’s AAA and NRA.The wartime collectivism also held forth a model to the nation’s liberalintellectuals, for here was seemingly a system that replaced laissez-faire notby the rigors and class hatreds of proletarian Marxism, but by a new strongState, planning and organizing the economy in harmony with all leading economicgroups. It was, not coincidentally, to be a neomercantilism, a “mixed economy,”heavily staffed by these selfsame liberal intellectuals. And finally, both bigbusiness and the liberals saw in the wartime model a way to organize andintegrate the often unruly labor force as a junior partner in the corporatistsystem—a force to be disciplined by their own “responsible” leadership of thelabor unions.For the rest of his life, Bernard Mannes Baruch sought to restore the lineamentsof the wartime model. Thus, in summing up the experience of the WIB, Baruchextolled the fact that:> many businessmen have experienced during the war, for the first time in their> careers, the tremendous advantages, both to themselves and to the general> public, of combination, of cooperation and common action ...Baruch called for the continuance of such corporate associations, in“inaugurating rules” to eliminate “waste” (i.e., competition), to exchange tradeinformation, to agree on the channeling of supply and demand among themselves,to avoid “extravagant” forms of competition and to allocate the location ofproduction. Completing the outlines of a corporate state, Baruch urged that suchassociations be governed by a federal agency, either the Department of Commerceor the Federal Trade Commission,> an agency whose duty it should be to encourage, under strict Government> supervision, such cooperation and coordination ...[46] [part0019.html#fn46]Baruch also envisioned a federal board for the retraining and channeling oflabor after the war. At the very least, he urged standby legislation for pricecontrol and for industrial coordination and mobilization in the event of anotherwar.[47] [part0019.html#fn47]During the 1920s and 1930s, Bernard Baruch served as a major inspiration of thedrive toward a corporate state; moreover, many of the leaders of this drive weremen who had served under him during the heady days of the WIB and who continuedto function frankly as “Baruch’s men” in national affairs. Thus, aided byBaruch, George N. Peek, of the Moline Plow Company, launched in the early 1920sthe drive for farm price supports through federally organized farm cartels thatwas to culminate in President Hoover’s Federal Farm Board in 1929 and then inRoosevelt’s AAA. Peek’s farm-equipment business, of course, stood to benefitgreatly from farm subsidies. Hoover appointed as first Chairman of the FFB noneother than Baruch’s old top aide from World War I, Alexander Legge ofInternational Harvester, the leading farm machinery manufacturer. When FranklinRoosevelt created the AAA, he first offered the job of director to Baruch andthen gave the post to Baruch’s man, George Peek.Neither was Baruch laggard in promoting a corporatist system for industry as awhole. In the spring of 1930, Baruch proposed a peacetime reincarnation of theWIB as a “Supreme Court of Industry.” In September of the following year, GerardSwope, head of General Electric and brother of Baruch’s closest confidantHerbert Bayard Swope, presented an elaborated plan for a corporate state thatessentially revived the system of wartime planning. At the same time, one ofBaruch’s oldest friends, former secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, was proposing asimilar plan for a “Peace Industries Board.” After Hoover dismayed his oldassociates by rejecting the plan, Franklin Roosevelt embodied it in the NRA,selecting Gerard Swope to help write the final draft, and picking another Baruchdisciple and World War aide General Hugh S. Johnson—also of the Moline PlowCompany—to direct this major instrument of state corporatism. When Johnson wasfired, Baruch himself was offered the post.[48] [part0019.html#fn48]Other leading NRA officials were veterans of war mobilization. Johnson’s chiefof staff was another old friend of Baruch’s, John Hancock, who had beenPaymaster General of the Navy during the war and had headed the naval industrialprogram for the War Industries Board; other high officials of the NRA were Dr.Leo Wolman, who had been head of the production-statistics division of the WIB;Charles F. Homer, leader of the wartime Liberty Loan drive; and General ClarenceC. Williams, who had been Chief of Ordnance in charge of Army war purchasing.Other WIB veterans highly placed in the New Deal were Isador Lubin, UnitedStates Commissioner of Labor Statistics in the New Deal; Captain Leon Hendersonof the Ordnance Division of the WIB; and Senator Joseph Guffey (D., Pa.), whohad worked in the WIB on conservation of oil, and who helped pattern the oil andcoal controls of the New Deal on the wartime Fuel Administration.[49][part0019.html#fn49]Another leading promoter of the new cooperation subsequent to his experience aswartime planner was Herbert Clark Hoover. As soon as the war was over, Hooverset out to “reconstruct America” along the lines of peacetime cooperation. Heurged national planning through “voluntary” cooperation among businessmen andother economic groups under the “central direction” of the government. TheFederal Reserve System was to allocate capital to essential industries andthereby to eliminate the competitive “wastes” of the free market. And in histerm as Secretary of Commerce during the 1920s, Hoover assiduously encouragedthe cartelization of industry through trade associations. In addition toinaugurating the modern program of farm price supports in the Federal FarmBoard, Hoover urged the coffee buyers to form a cartel to lower buying prices,established a buying cartel in the rubber industry, led the oil industry inworking toward restrictions on oil production in the name of “conservation”,tried repeatedly to raise prices, restrict production, and encourage marketingco-ops in the coal industry, and tried to force the cotton textile industry intoa nationwide cartel to restrict production. Specifically in furtherance of thewartime abolition of thousands of diverse and competitive products, Hoovercontinued to impose standardization and “simplification” of materials andproducts during the 1920s. In this way, Hoover managed to abolish or “simplify”about a thousand industrial products. The “simplification” was worked out by theDepartment of Commerce in collaboration with committees from each industry.[50][part0019.html#fn50] Grosvenor Clarkson hailed the fact that> it is probable that there will never again be such a multiplicity of styles> and models in machinery and other heavy and costly articles as there was> before the restrictions necessitated by the war. ... The ideas conceived and> applied by the War Industries Board in war are being applied in peace by the> Department of Commerce ...[51] [part0019.html#fn51]Not the least of the influential groups dazzled and marked by the experience ofwar collectivism were the liberal intellectuals. Never before had so manyintellectuals and academicians swarmed into government to help plan, regulate,and mobilize the economic system. The intellectuals served as advisers,technicians, framers of legislation, and administrators of bureaus. Furthermore,apart from the rewards of newly acquired prestige and power, the war economyheld out to such intellectuals the promise of transforming the society into a“third way” completely different from the laissez-faire past that they scornedor the looming proletarian Marxism that they reviled and feared. Here was aplanned corporate economy that seemed to harmonize all groups and classes undera strong and guiding nation-state with the liberals themselves at or near thehelm. In a notable article, Professor Leuchtenburg saw the war collectivism as“a logical outgrowth of the Progressive movement.”[52] [part0019.html#fn52] Hedemonstrated the enthusiasm of the Progressive intellectuals for the socialtransformation effected by the war. Thus, the New Republic hailed the“revolutionizing” of society by means of the war; John Dewey hailed thereplacement of production for profit and “the absoluteness of private property”by production for use. Economists were particularly enchanted by the “notabledemonstration of the power of war to force concert of effort and collectiveplanning” and looked for “the same sort of centralized directing now employed tokill their enemies abroad for the new purpose of reconstructing their own lifeat home.”[53] [part0019.html#fn53]Rexford Guy Tugwell, ever alert to the advance of social engineering, was soonto look back wistfully on “America’s wartime socialism”; lamenting the end ofthe war, he declared that “only the Armistice prevented a great experiment incontrol of production, control of price, and control of consumption.” For,during the war, the old system of industrial competition had “melted away in thefierce new heat of nationalistic vision.”[54] [part0019.html#fn54]Not merely the NRA and AAA, but virtually the entire New Dealapparatus—including the bringing to Washington of a host of liberalintellectuals and planners—owed its inspiration to the war collectivism of WorldWar I. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, founded by Hoover in 1932 andexpanded by Roosevelt’s New Deal, was a revival and expansion of the old WarFinance Corporation, which had loaned government funds to munitions firms.Furthermore, Hoover, after offering the post to Bernard Baruch, named as firstChairman of the RFC, Eugene Meyer, Jr., an old protégé of Baruch’s, who had beenmanaging director of the WFC. Much of the old WFC staff and method of operationswere taken over bodily by the new agency. The Tennessee Valley Authority grewout of a wartime government nitrate and electric-power project at Muscle Shoals,and in fact included the old nitrate plant as one of its first assets. Moreover,many of the public power advocates in the New Deal had been trained in suchwartime agencies as the Power Section of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Andeven the innovative government corporate form of the TVA was based on wartimeprecedent.[55] [part0019.html#fn55]Wartime experience also provided the inspiration for the public housing movementof the New Deal. During the war, the Emergency Fleet Corp. and the United StatesHousing Corp. were established to provide housing for war workers. The warestablished the precedent of federal housing and also trained architects likeRobert Kohn, who functioned as chief of production for the housing division ofthe United States Shipping Board. After the war, Kohn exulted that “the war hasput housing ‘on the map’ in this country,” and in 1933, Kohn was duly named byPresident Roosevelt to be the director of the New Deal’s first venture intopublic housing. Furthermore, the Emergency Fleet Corp. and the United StatesHousing Corp. established large-scale public housing communities on planned“garden city” principles (Yorkship Village, N.J.; Union Park Gardens, Del.;Black Rock and Crane Tracts, Conn.)—principles finally remembered and put intoeffect in the New Deal and afterward.[56] [part0019.html#fn56]The oil and coal controls established in the New Deal also rested on theprecedent of the wartime Fuel Administration. Indeed, Senator Joseph Guffey (D.,Pa.), leader in the coal and oil controls, had been head of the petroleumsection of the War Industries Board.Deeply impressed with the “national unity” and mobilization achieved during thewar, the New Deal established the Civilian Conservation Corps to instill themartial spirit in America’s youth. The idea was to take the “wandering boys” offthe road and “mobilize” them into a new form of American Expeditionary Force.The Army, in fact, ran the CCC camps; CCC recruits were gathered at Armyrecruiting stations, equipped with World War I clothing, and assembled in armytents. The CCC, the New Dealers exulted, had given a new sense of meaning to thenation’s youth, in this new “forestry army.” Speaker Henry T. Rainey (D., Ill.)of the House of Representatives put it this way:> They [the CCC recruits] are also under military training and as they come out> of it ... improved in health and developed mentally and physically and are> more useful citizens ... they would furnish a very valuable nucleus for an> army.[57] [part0019.html#fn57]3. THE DRIVE TO PROLONG WAR COLLECTIVISMParticularly good evidence of the deep imprint of war collectivism was thereluctance of many of its leaders to abandon it when the war was finally over.Business leaders pressed for two postwar goals: continuance of government pricefixing to protect them against an expected postwar deflation, and a longer-rangeattempt to promote industrial cartelization in peacetime. In particular,businessmen wanted the price maxima (which had often served as minima instead)to be converted simply into outright minima for the postwar period. Wartimequotas to restrict production, furthermore, needed only to remain in being tofunction as a frank cartelizing for raising prices in time of peace.Accordingly, many of the industrial War Service Committees, and their WIBSection counterparts, urged the continuance of the WIB and its price-fixingsystem. In particular, section chiefs invariably urged continued price controlin those industries that feared postwar deflation, while advocating a return toa free market wherever the specific industry expected a continuing boom. Thus,Professor Himmelberg concluded,> Section chiefs in their recommendations to the Board consistently followed the> wishes of their industries in urging protection if the industry expected price> declines and release of all controls when the industry expected a favorable> postwar market.[58] [part0019.html#fn58]Robert S. Brookings, Chairman of the Price-Fixing Committee of the WIB, declaredthat the WIB would be “as helpful ... during the reconstruction period as wehave during the war period in stabilizing values.”[59] [part0019.html#fn59]From the big-business world, meanwhile, Harry A. Wheeler, president of theUnited States Chamber of Commerce, presented to Woodrow Wilson in early October1918, an ambitious scheme for a “Reconstruction Commission,” to be composed ofall the economic interests of the nation.The WIB itself concurred and urged the president to allow it to continue afterthe war. Baruch himself urged on Wilson the continuation of at least the minimumprice-fixing policies of the WIB. However, Baruch was gulling the public when heforesaw a postwar WIB as guarding against both inflation and deflation; therewas no inclination to impose maximum prices against inflation.The great problem with these ambitious plans of both industry and government wasPresident Wilson himself. Perhaps a lingering attachment to the ideals, or atleast to the rhetoric, of free competition prevented the president from givingany favorable attention to these postwar schemes.[60] [part0019.html#fn60] Theattachment was particularly nourished by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, ofall Wilson’s advisers the closest to a believer in laissez-faire. ThroughoutOctober 1918, Wilson rejected all of these proposals. The response of Baruch andthe WIB was to put further pressure on Wilson during early November, by publiclypredicting and urging that the WIB would definitely be needed duringdemobilization. Thus The New York Times reported, the day after the Armistice,that> War Industries Board officials declared there would be much work for that> organization to do. They foresee no serious industrial dislocation with the> Government’s grip on all war industries and material held tight.[61]> [part0019.html#fn61]The president remained adamant, however, and on November 23 he ordered thecomplete disbanding of the WIB by the end of the year. The disappointed WIBofficials accepted the decision without protest, partly because of expectedcongressional opposition to any attempt to continue, partly from the hostilityto continued controls by those industries anticipating a boom. Thus, the shoeindustry particularly chafed at any continuing controls.[62][part0019.html#fn62] The industries favoring controls, however, urged the WIB atleast to ratify their own price minima and agreements for restricting productionfor the coming winter, and to do so just before the disbandment of the agency.The Board was sorely tempted to engage in this final exploit, and indeed wasinformed by its legal staff that it could successfully continue such controlsbeyond the life of the agency even against the will of the president. The WIB,however, reluctantly turned down requests to this effect by the acid, zinc, andsteel manufacturers on December 11.[63] [part0019.html#fn63] It only rejectedthe price-fixing plans, however, because it feared being overturned by thecourts should the Attorney General challenge such a decision.One of the most ardent advocates of continued WIB price control was the greatsteel industry. Two days after the Armistice, Judge Gary of U.S. Steel urged theWIB to continue its regulations and declared that “The members of the steelindustry desire to cooperate with each other in every proper way.” Gary urged athree-month extension of price fixing, with further gradual reductions thatwould prevent a return to “destructive” competition. Baruch replied that he waspersonally “willing to go to the very limit,” but he was blocked by Wilson’sattitude.[64] [part0019.html#fn64]If the WIB itself could not continue, perhaps the wartime cartelization couldpersist in other forms. During November, Arch W. Shaw, Chicago industrialist andhead of the Conservation Division of the WIB (whose wartime work in fosteringstandardization was being transferred to the Department of Commerce) andSecretary of Commerce William Redfield agreed on a bill to allow manufacturersto collaborate in “the adoption of plans for the elimination of needless wastein the public interest,” under the supervision of the Federal Trade Commission.When this proposal fizzled, Edwin B. Parker, Priorities Commissioner of the WIB,proposed in late November a frankly cartelizing bill that would allow themajority of the firms in any given industry to set production quotas that wouldhave to be obeyed by all the firms in that industry. The Parker plan won theapproval of Baruch, Peek, and numerous other government officials andbusinessmen, but WIB’s legal counsel warned that Congress would never give itsconsent.[65] [part0019.html#fn65] Another proposal that interested Baruch wasadvanced by Mark Requa, Assistant Food Administrator, who proposed a UnitedStates Board of Trade to encourage and regulate industrial agreements that“promoted the national welfare.”[66] [part0019.html#fn66]Whatever the reason, Bernard Baruch failed to press hard for these proposals,and so they died on the vine. If Baruch failed to press matters, however, hisassociate George Peek, head of the Finished Products Division of the WIB, wasnot so reticent. By mid-December 1918, Peek wrote Baruch that the postwar eramust retain the “benefits of proper cooperation.” In particular,> proper legislation should be enacted to permit cooperation in industry, in> order that the lessons we have learned during the war may be capitalized ...> in peacetime ... Conservation; ... standardization of products and processes,> price fixing under certain conditions, etc., should continue with Government> cooperation.[67] [part0019.html#fn67]By late December, Peek was proposing legislation for> some kind of an Emergency Peace Bureau ... in order that businessmen may, in> conjunction with such a Bureau, have an opportunity to meet and cooperate with> Governmental cooperation.[68] [part0019.html#fn68]The leading business groups endorsed similar plans. In early December, theChamber of Commerce of the United States called a meeting of the variousindustrial War Service Committees to convene as a “Reconstruction Congress ofAmerican Industry.” The Reconstruction Congress called for revision of theSherman Act to permit “reasonable” trade agreements under a supervisory body.Furthermore, a nationwide Chamber referendum, in early 1919, approved such aproposal by an overwhelming majority, and President Harry Wheeler urged the“cordial acceptance by organized business” of regulation that would ratifybusiness agreements. The National Association of Manufacturers, before the wardevoted to competition, warmly endorsed the same goals.The last gasp of wartime cartelization came in February 1919, with theestablishment by the Department of Commerce of the Industrial Board.[69][part0019.html#fn69] Secretary of Commerce William C. Redfield, formerlypresident of the American Manufacturers Export Association, had long championedthe view that government should promote and coordinate industrial cooperation.Redfield saw an entering wedge with the transfer of the WIB’s ConservationDivision to his department shortly after the Armistice. Redfield continued thewartime stimulation of trade associations, and to that end established anadvisory board of former WIB officials. One of these advisers was George Peek;another was Peek’s assistant on the WIB, Ohio lumber executive William M.Ritter. It was Ritter, in fact, who originated the idea of the Industrial Board.The Industrial Board, conceived by Ritter in January, 1919, and enthusiasticallyadopted and pushed by Secretary Redfield, was a cunning scheme. On its face, andas promoted to President Wilson and to others in the administration andCongress, the Board was merely a device to secure large price reductions, andthereby to lower the inflated level of general prices and to stimulate consumerdemand. It was therefore seemingly unrelated to the previous cartelizing driveand hence won the approval of the president, who established the new Board inmid-February. At Ritter’s urging, George Peek was named chairman of the IB;other members included Ritter himself, George R. James, head of a major Memphisdry-goods concern and former chief of the Cotton and Cotton Linters section ofthe WIB; Lewis B. Reed, vice president of the U.S. Silica Co. and another formerassistant to Peek; steel castings manufacturer Samuel P. Bush, former head ofthe WIB’s Facilities Division; Atlanta steel-fabricating manufacturer ThomasGlenn, also a veteran of the WIB; and two “outsiders,” one representing theLabor Department and the other the Railroad Administration.No sooner did the IB get under way than it pursued its real, but previouslycamouflaged, purpose: not to reduce, but rather to stabilize prices at existinghigh levels. Moreover, the method of stabilization would be the longed-for butpreviously rejected path of ratifying industrial price agreements arrived at incollaboration with the Board. Deciding on this cartelizing policy in earlyMarch, the IB moved toward the first application in a conference with,unsurprisingly, the steel industry on March 19–20, 1919. Opening the conference,Chairman George Peek grandly declared that the event might prove “epoch-making,”especially in establishing “real genuine cooperation between Government,industry, and labor, so that we may eliminate ... the possibility of thedestructive forces ...”[70] [part0019.html#fn70] The steel men were of coursedelighted, hailing the “great chance ... to come into close contact with theGovernment itself ...”[71] [part0019.html#fn71] The IB told the steel industrythat any agreement to sustain prices agreed upon by the conference would beimmune from the antitrust laws. Not only was the price list offered by the IB tothe steel men still very high even if moderately lower than existing prices; butPeek agreed to announce to the public that steel prices would not be loweredfurther for the remainder of the year. Peek advised the steel men that hisstatement would be their biggest asset, for “I don’t know what I wouldn’t havegiven in times past if in my own business I could say that the government of theUnited States says this is as low a price as you could get.”[72][part0019.html#fn72]The IB-steel agreement lowered steel prices by a modest 10% to 14%. The small,high-cost steel producers were disgruntled, but the big steel firms welcomed theagreement as a coordinated, orderly reduction of inflated prices, and especiallywelcomed the Board’s guarantee of the fixed price for the remainder of the year.The elated IB proceeded with similar conferences for the coal and buildingmaterials industries, but two dark clouds promptly appeared: the refusal of thegovernment’s own Railroad Administration to pay the fixed, agreed-upon, pricefor steel rails and for coal; and the concern of the Justice Department for theevident violation of the antitrust laws. The railroad men running the RAparticularly balked at the reduced but still high price that they were going tobe forced to pay for steel rails—at a rate that they declared was at least twodollars per ton above the free-market price. Walker D. Hines, head of the RA,denounced the IB as a price-fixing agency, dominated by steel and otherindustries, and he called for the abolition of the Industrial Board. This callwas seconded by the powerful Secretary of the Treasury Carter Glass. TheAttorney General concurred that the IB’s policy was illegal price fixing and inviolation of the antitrust laws. Finally, President Wilson dissolved theIndustrial Board in early May, 1919; wartime industrial planning had at lastbeen dissolved, its formal cartelization to reappear a decade and a half later.Yet remnants of wartime collectivism still remained. The high wartime minimumwheat price of $2.26 a bushel was carried over to the 1919 crop, continuinguntil June, 1920. But the most important carry-over of war collectivism was theRailroad Administration: the government’s operation of the nation’s railroads.When William Gibbs McAdoo resigned as head of the RA at the end of the war, hewas succeeded by the previous de facto operating head, railroad executive WalkerD. Hines. There was no call for immediate return to private operation becausethe railroad industry generally agreed on drastic regulation to curb oreliminate “wasteful” railroad competition and coordinate the industry, to fixprices to ensure a “fair profit,” and to outlaw strikes through compulsoryarbitration. This was the overall thrust of railroad sentiment. Furthermore,being in effective control of the RA, the roads were in no hurry to return toprivate operation and jurisdiction by the less reliable ICC. Although McAdoo’splan to postpone by five years the given 1920 date for return to privateoperation gained little support, Congress proceeded to use its time during 1919to tighten the monopolization of the railroads.In the name of “scientific management,” Senator Albert Cummins (R., Iowa)proceeded to grant the railroads’ fondest dreams. Cummins’ bill, warmly approvedby Hines and railroad executive Daniel Willard, ordered the consolidation ofnumerous railroads, and would set the railroad rates according to a “fair,”fixed return on capital investment. Strikes would be outlawed, and all labordisputes settled by compulsory arbitration. For their part, the Association ofRailroad Executives submitted a legislative plan similar to the Cummins Bill.Also similar to the Cummins Bill was the proposal of the National Association ofOwners of Railroad Securities, a group composed largely of savings banks andinsurance companies. In contrast to these plans, the Citizens National RailroadLeague, consisting of individual railroad investors, proposed coercedconsolidation into one national railroad corporation and the guaranteeing ofminimum earnings to this new road.All of these plans were designed to tip the prewar balance sharply in favor ofthe railroads and against the shippers, and, as a result, the Cummins Bill, inpassing the Senate, ran into trouble in the House. The trouble was fomented bythe shippers, who demanded a return to the status quo ante when theshipper-dominated ICC was in charge. Furthermore, for their part, the wartimeexperience had embittered the shippers, who, along with the ICC itself, demandeda return to the higher quality service provided by railroad competition ratherthan the increased monopolization provided by the various railroad bills.Unsurprisingly, however, one of the leading nonrailroad business groups favoringthe Cummins Bill was the Railway Business Association, a group of manufacturersand distributors of railroad supplies and equipment. The House ofRepresentatives, in its turn, passed the Esch Bill, which essentiallyreestablished the prewar rule of the ICC.President Wilson had put pressure on Congress to make a decision by threateningthe return of the railroads to private operation by the given date of January 1,1920, but, under pressure of the railroads who were anxious to push the CumminsBill, Wilson extended the deadline to March 1. Finally, the joint conferencecommittee of Congress reported out the Transportation Act of 1920, a compromisethat was essentially the Esch Bill returning the railroads to the prewar ICC,but adding the Cummins provisions for a two-year guarantee to the railroads toset rates providing a “fair return” of 5.5% on investment. Furthermore, on theagreement of both shippers and the roads, the power to set minimum railroadrates was now granted to the ICC. This agreement was the product of railroadseager to set a floor under freight rates, and shippers anxious to protectbudding canal transportation against railroad competition. Furthermore, althoughrailway union objections blocked the provision for the outlawing of strikes, aRailroad Labor Board was established to try to settle labor disputes.[73][part0019.html#fn73]With the return of the railroads to private operation in March, 1920, warcollectivism finally and at long last seemed to pass from the American scene.But pass it never really did; for the inspiration and the model that itfurnished for a corporate state in America continued to guide Herbert Hoover andother leaders in the 1920s, and was to return full-blown in the New Deal and inthe World War II economy. In fact, it supplied the broad outlines for thecorporate monopoly state that the New Deal was to establish, seeminglypermanently, in the United States of America.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in A New History of Leviathan, Ronald Radosh and Murray N.Rothbard, eds.

INTRODUCTIONIn contrast to older historians who regarded World War I as the destruction ofprogressive reform, I am convinced that the war came to the United States as the“fulfillment,” the culmination, the veritable apotheosis of progressivism inAmerican life.[1] [part0020.html#fn1] I regard progressivism as basically amovement on behalf of Big Government in all walks of the economy and society, ina fusion or coalition between various groups of big businessmen, led by theHouse of Morgan, and rising groups of technocratic and statist intellectuals. Inthis fusion, the values and interests of both groups would be pursued throughgovernment. Big business would be able to use the government to cartelize theeconomy, restrict competition, and regulate production and prices, and also tobe able to wield a militaristic and imperialist foreign policy to force openmarkets abroad and apply the sword of the State to protect foreign investments.Intellectuals would be able to use the government to restrict entry into theirprofessions and to assume jobs in Big Government to apologize for, and to helpplan and staff, government operations. Both groups also believed that, in thisfusion, the Big State could be used to harmonize and interpret the “nationalinterest” and thereby provide a “middle way” between the extremes of“dog-eat-dog” laissez-faire and the bitter conflicts of proletarian Marxism.Also animating both groups of progressives was a postmillennial pietistProtestantism that had conquered “Yankee” areas of northern Protestantism by the1830s and had impelled the pietists to use local, state, and finally federalgovernments to stamp out “sin,” to make America and eventually the world holy,and thereby to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth. The victory of theBryanite forces at the Democratic national convention of 1896 destroyed theDemocratic Party as the vehicle of “liturgical” Roman Catholics and GermanLutherans devoted to personal liberty and laissez-faire and created the roughlyhomogenized and relatively non-ideological party system we have today. After theturn of the century, this development created an ideological and power vacuumfor the expanding number of progressive technocrats and administrators to fill.In that way, the locus of government shifted from the legislature, at leastpartially subject to democratic check, to the oligarchic and technocraticexecutive branch.World War I brought the fulfillment of all these progressive trends. Militarism,conscription, massive intervention at home and abroad, a collectivized wareconomy, all came about during the war and created a mighty cartelized systemthat most of its leaders spent the rest of their lives trying to recreate, inpeace as well as war. In the World War I chapter of his outstanding work, Crisisand Leviathan, Professor Robert Higgs concentrates on the war economy andilluminates the interconnections with conscription. In this paper, I would liketo concentrate on an area that Professor Higgs relatively neglects: the comingto power during the war of the various groups of progressive intellectuals.[2][part0020.html#fn2] I use the term “intellectual” in the broad sensepenetratingly described by F.A. Hayek: that is, not merely theorists andacademicians, but also all manner of opinion-molders in society—writers,journalists, preachers, scientists, activists of all sort—what Hayek calls“secondhand dealers in ideas.”[3] [part0020.html#fn3] Most of theseintellectuals, of whatever strand or occupation, were either dedicated,messianic postmillennial pietists or else former pietists, born in a deeplypietist home, who, though now secularized, still possessed an intense messianicbelief in national and world salvation through Big Government. But, in addition,oddly but characteristically, most combined in their thought and agitationmessianic moral or religious fervor with an empirical, allegedly “value-free,”and strictly “scientific” devotion to social science. Whether it be the medicalprofession’s combined scientific and moralistic devotion to stamping out sin ora similar position among economists or philosophers, this blend is typical ofprogressive intellectuals.In this paper, I will be dealing with various examples of individual or groupsof progressive intellectuals, exulting in the triumph of their creed and theirown place in it, as a result of America’s entry into World War I. Unfortunately,limitations of space and time preclude dealing with all facets of the wartimeactivity of progressive intellectuals; in particular, I regret having to omittreatment of the conscription movement, a fascinating example of the creed ofthe “therapy” of “discipline” led by upper-class intellectuals and businessmenin the J.P. Morgan ambit.[4] [part0020.html#fn4] I shall also have to omit boththe highly significant trooping to the war colors of the nation’s preachers, andthe wartime impetus toward the permanent centralization of scientificresearch.[5] [part0020.html#fn5]There is no better epigraph for the remainder of this paper than acongratulatory note sent to President Wilson after the delivery of his warmessage on April 2, 1917. The note was sent by Wilson’s son-in-law and fellowSouthern pietist and progressive, Secretary of the Treasury William GibbsMcAdoo, a man who had spent his entire life as an industrialist in New YorkCity, solidly in the J.P. Morgan ambit. McAdoo wrote to Wilson: “You have done agreat thing nobly! I firmly believe that it is God’s will that America should dothis transcendent service for humanity throughout the world and that you are Hischosen instrument.”[6] [part0020.html#fn6] It was not a sentiment with which thepresident could disagree.2. PIETISM AND PROHIBITIONOne of the few important omissions in Professor Higgs’s book is the crucial roleof postmillennial pietist Protestantism in the drive toward statism in theUnited States. Dominant in the “Yankee” areas of the North from the 1830s on,the aggressive “evangelical” form of pietism conquered Southern Protestantism bythe 1890s and played a crucial role in progressivism after the turn of thecentury and through World War I. Evangelical pietism held that requisite to anyman’s salvation is that he do his best to see to it that everyone else is saved,and doing one’s best inevitably meant that the State must become a crucialinstrument in maximizing people’s chances for salvation. In particular, theState plays a pivotal role in stamping out sin, and in “making America holy.” Tothe pietists, sin was very broadly defined as any force that might cloud men’sminds so that they could not exercise their theological free will to achievesalvation. Of particular importance were slavery (until the Civil War), DemonRum, and the Roman Catholic Church, headed by the Antichrist in Rome. Fordecades after the Civil War, “rebellion” took the place of slavery in thepietist charges against their great political enemy, the Democratic Party.[7][part0020.html#fn7] Then in 1896, with the evangelical conversion of SouthernProtestantism and the admission to the Union of the sparsely populated andpietist Mountain states, William Jennings Bryan was able to put together acoalition that transformed the Democrats into a pietist party and ended foreverthat party’s once proud role as the champion of “liturgical” (Catholic and HighGerman Lutheran) Christianity and of personal liberty and laissez-faire.[8][part0020.html#fn8][9] [part0020.html#fn9]The pietists of the 19th and early 20th centuries were all postmillennialist:They believed that the Second Advent of Christ will occur only after themillennium—a thousand years of the establishment of the Kingdom of God onearth—has been brought about by human effort. Postmillennialists have thereforetended to be statists, with the State becoming an important instrument ofstamping out sin and Christianizing the social order so as to speed Jesus’return.[10] [part0020.html#fn10]Professor Timberlake neatly sums up this politico-religious conflict:> Unlike those extremist and apocalyptic sects that rejected and withdrew from> the world as hopelessly corrupt, and unlike the more conservative churches,> such as the Roman Catholic, Protestant Episcopal, and Lutheran, that tended to> assume a more relaxed attitude toward the influence of religion in culture,> evangelical Protestantism sought to overcome the corruption of the world in a> dynamic manner, not only by converting men to belief in Christ but also by> Christianizing the social order through the power and force of law. According> to this view, the Christian’s duty was to use the secular power of the state> to transform culture so that the community of the faithful might be kept pure> and the work of saving the unregenerate might be made easier. Thus the> function of law was not simply to restrain evil but to educate and uplift.[11]> [part0020.html#fn11]Both prohibition and progressive reform were pietistic, and as both movementsexpanded after 1900 they became increasingly intertwined. The Prohibition Party,once confined—at least in its platform—to a single issue, became increasinglyand frankly progressive after 1904. The Anti-Saloon League, the major vehiclefor prohibitionist agitation after 1900, was also markedly devoted toprogressive reform. Thus at the League’s annual convention in 1905, Rev. HowardH. Russell rejoiced in the growing movement for progressive reform andparticularly hailed Theodore Roosevelt as that “leader of heroic mould, ofabsolute honesty of character and purity of life, that foremost man of thisworld ...”[12] [part0020.html#fn12] At the Anti-Saloon League’s convention of1909, Rev. Purley A. Baker lauded the labor union movement as a holy crusade forjustice and a square deal. The League’s 1915 convention, which attracted 10,000people, was noted for the same blend of statism, social service, and combativeChristianity that had marked the national convention of the Progressive Party in1912.[13] [part0020.html#fn13] And at the League’s June 1916 convention, BishopLuther B. Wilson stated, without contradiction, that everyone present wouldundoubtedly hail the progressive reforms then being proposed.During the Progressive years, the Social Gospel became part of the mainstream ofpietist Protestantism. Most of the evangelical churches created commissions onsocial service to promulgate the Social Gospel, and virtually all of thedenominations adopted the Social Creed drawn up in 1912 by the Commission of theChurch and Social Service of the Federal Council of Churches. The creed calledfor the abolition of child labor, the regulation of female labor, the right oflabor to organize (i.e., compulsory collective bargaining), the elimination ofpoverty, and an “equitable” division of the national product. And right up thereas a matter of social concern was the liquor problem. The creed maintained thatliquor was a grave hindrance toward the establishment of the Kingdom of God onearth, and it advocated the “protection of the individual and society from thesocial, economic, and moral waste of the liquor traffic.”[14][part0020.html#fn14]The Social Gospel leaders were fervent advocates of statism and of prohibition.These included Rev. Walter Rauschenbusch and Rev. Charles Stelzle, whose tractWhy Prohibition! (1918) was distributed, after the United States’ entry intoWorld War I, by the Commission on Temperance of the Federal Council of Churchesto labor leaders, members of Congress, and important government officials. Aparticularly important Social Gospel leader was Rev. Josiah Strong, whosemonthly journal, The Gospel of the Kingdom, was published by Strong’s AmericanInstitute of Social Service. In an article supporting prohibition in the July1914 issue, The Gospel of the Kingdom hailed the progressive spirit that was atlast putting an end to “personal liberty”:> “Personal Liberty” is at last an uncrowned, dethroned king, with no one to do> him reverence. The social consciousness is so far developed, and is becoming> so autocratic, that institutions and governments must give heed to its mandate> and share their life accordingly. We are no longer frightened by that ancient> bogy—“paternalism in government.” We affirm boldly, it is the business of> government to be just that—Paternal. ... Nothing human can be foreign to a> true government.[15] [part0020.html#fn15]As true crusaders, the pietists were not content to stop with the stamping outof sin in the United States alone. If American pietism was convinced thatAmericans were God’s chosen people, destined to establish a Kingdom of Godwithin the United States, surely the pietists’ religious and moral duty couldnot stop there. In a sense, the world was America’s oyster. As ProfessorTimberlake put it, once the Kingdom of God was in the course of beingestablished in the United States, “it was therefore America’s mission to spreadthese ideals and institutions abroad so that the Kingdom could be establishedthroughout the world. American Protestants were accordingly not content merelyto work for the kingdom of God in America, but felt compelled to assist in thereformation of the rest of the world also.”[16] [part0020.html#fn16]American entry into World War I provided the fulfillment of prohibitionistdreams. In the first place, all food production was placed under the control ofHerbert Hoover, Food Administration Czar. But if the U.S. government was tocontrol and allocate food resources, shall it permit the precious scarce supplyof grain to be siphoned off into the “waste,” if not the sin, of the manufactureof liquor? Even though less than 2% of American cereal production went into themanufacture of alcohol, think of the starving children of the world who mightotherwise be fed. As the progressive weekly The Independent demagogicallyphrased it, “Shall the many have food, or the few have drink?”For the ostensible purpose of “conserving” grain, Congress wrote an amendmentinto the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act of August 10, 1917, that absolutelyprohibited the use of foodstuffs, hence grain, in the production of alcohol.Congress would have added a prohibition on the manufacture of wine or beer, butPresident Wilson persuaded the Anti-Saloon League that he could accomplish thesame goal more slowly and thereby avoid a delaying filibuster by the wets inCongress. However, Herbert Hoover, a progressive and a prohibitionist, persuadedWilson to issue an order, on December 8, both greatly reducing the alcoholiccontent of beer and limiting the amount of foodstuffs that could be used in itsmanufacture.[17] [part0020.html#fn17]The prohibitionists were able to use the Lever Act and war patriotism to goodeffect. Thus, Mrs. W.E. Lindsey, wife of the governor of New Mexico, delivered aspeech in November 1917 that noted the Lever Act, and declared:> Aside from the long list of awful tragedies following in the wake of the> liquor traffic, the economic waste is too great to be tolerated at this time.> With so many people of the allied nations near to the door of starvation, it> would be criminal ingratitude for us to continue the manufacture of> whiskey.[18] [part0020.html#fn18]Another rationale for prohibition during the war was the alleged necessity toprotect American soldiers from the dangers of alcohol to their health, theirmorals, and their immortal souls. As a result, in the Selective Service Act ofMay 18, 1917, Congress provided that dry zones must be established around everyarmy base, and it was made illegal to sell or even to give liquor to any memberof the military establishment within those zones, even in one’s private home.Any inebriated servicemen were subject to courts-martial.But the most severe thrust toward national prohibition was the Anti-SaloonLeague’s proposed 18th constitutional amendment, outlawing the manufacture,sale, transportation, import, or export of all intoxicating liquors. It waspassed by Congress and submitted to the states at the end of December 1917. Wetarguments that prohibition would prove unenforceable were met with the usual dryappeal to high principle: Should laws against murder and robbery be repealedsimply because they cannot be completely enforced? And arguments that privateproperty would be unjustly confiscated were also brushed aside with thecontention that property injurious to the health, morals, and safety of thepeople had always been subject to confiscation without compensation.When the Lever Act made a distinction between hard liquor (forbidden) and beerand wine (limited), the brewing industry tried to save their skins by cuttingthemselves loose from the taint of distilled spirits. “The true relationshipwith beer,” insisted the United States Brewers Association, “is with light winesand soft drinks—not with hard liquors ...” The brewers affirmed their desire to“sever, once for all, the shackles that bound our wholesome productions ... toardent spirits ...” But this craven attitude would do the brewers no good. Afterall, one of the major objectives of the drys was to smash the brewers, once andfor all, they whose product was the very embodiment of the drinking habits ofthe hated German-American masses, both Catholic and Lutheran, liturgicals andbeer drinkers all. German-Americans were now fair game. Were they not all agentsof the satanic Kaiser, bent on conquering the world? Were they not consciousagents of the dreaded Hun Kultur, out to destroy American civilization? And werenot most brewers German?And so the Anti-Saloon League thundered that “German brewers in this countryhave rendered thousands of men inefficient and are thus crippling the Republicin its war on Prussian militarism.” Apparently, the Anti-Saloon League took noheed of the work of German brewers in Germany, who were presumably performingthe estimable service of rendering “Prussian militarism” helpless. The brewerswere accused of being pro-German, and of subsidizing the press (apparently itwas all right to be pro-English or to subsidize the press if one were not abrewer). The acme of the accusations came from one prohibitionist: “We haveGerman enemies,” he warned, “in this country too. And the worst of all ourGerman enemies, the most treacherous, the most menacing are Pabst, Schlitz,Blatz, and Miller.”[19] [part0020.html#fn19]In this sort of atmosphere, the brewers didn’t have a chance, and the 18thAmendment went to the states, outlawing all forms of liquor. Since 27 states hadalready outlawed liquor, this meant that only nine more were needed to ratifythis remarkable amendment, which directly involved the federal constitution inwhat had always been, at most, a matter of police power of the states. The 36thstate ratified the 18th Amendment on January 16, 1919, and by the end ofFebruary, all but three states (New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) hadmade liquor unconstitutional as well as illegal. Technically, the amendment wentinto force the following January, but Congress speeded matters up by passing theWar Prohibition Act of November 21, 1918, which banned the manufacture of beerand wine after the following May and outlawed the sale of all intoxicatingbeverages after June 30, 1919, a ban to continue in effect until the end ofdemobilization. Thus total national prohibition really began on July 1, 1919,with the 18th Amendment taking over six months later. The constitutionalamendment needed a congressional enforcing act, which Congress supplied with theVolstead (or National Prohibition) Act, passed over Wilson’s veto at the end ofOctober 1919.With the battle against Demon Rum won at home, the restless advocates of pietistprohibitionism looked for new lands to conquer. Today America, tomorrow theworld. In June 1919, the triumphant Anti-Saloon League called an internationalprohibition conference in Washington and created a World League AgainstAlcoholism. World prohibition, after all, was needed to finish the job of makingthe world safe for democracy. The prohibitionists’ goals were ferventlyexpressed by Rev. A.C. Bane at the Anti-Saloon League’s 1917 convention, whenvictory in America was already in sight. To a wildly cheering throng, Banethundered:> America will “go over the top” in humanity’s greatest battle [against liquor]> and plant the victorious white standard of Prohibition upon the nation’s> loftiest eminence. Then catching sight of the beckoning hand of our sister> nations across the sea, struggling with the same age-long foe, we will go> forth with the spirit of the missionary and the crusader to help drive the> demon of drink from all civilization. With America leading the way, with faith> in Omnipotent God, and bearing with patriotic hands our stainless flag, the> emblem of civic purity, we will soon ... bestow upon mankind the priceless> gift of World Prohibition.[20] [part0020.html#fn20]Fortunately, the prohibitionists found the reluctant world a tougher nut tocrack.3. WOMEN AT WAR AND AT THE POLLSAnother direct outgrowth of World War I, coming in tandem with prohibition butlasting more permanently, was the 19th Amendment, submitted by Congress in 1919and ratified by the following year, which allowed women to vote. Women’ssuffrage had long been a movement directly allied with prohibition. Desperate tocombat a demographic trend that seemed to be going against them, the evangelicalpietists called for women’s suffrage (and enacted it in many western states).They did so because they knew that while pietist women were socially andpolitically active, ethnic or liturgical women tended to be culturally bound tohearth and home and therefore far less likely to vote. Hence, women’s suffragewould greatly increase pietist voting power. In 1869 the Prohibitionist Partybecame the first party to endorse women’s suffrage, which it continued to do.The Progressive Party was equally enthusiastic about female suffrage; it was thefirst major national party to permit women delegates at its conventions. Aleading women’s suffrage organization was the Women’s Christian TemperanceUnion, which reached an enormous membership of 300,000 by 1900. And threesuccessive presidents of the major women’s suffrage group, the National AmericanWoman Suffrage Association—Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, and Dr.Anna Howard Shaw—all began their activist careers as prohibitionists. Susan B.Anthony put the issue clearly:> There is an enemy of the homes of this nation and that enemy is drunkenness.> Everyone connected with the gambling house, the brothel and the saloon works> and votes solidly against the enfranchisement of women, and, I say, if you> believe in chastity, if you believe in honesty and integrity, then ... take> the necessary steps to put the ballot in the hands of women.[21]> [part0020.html#fn21]For its part, the German-American Alliance of Nebraska sent out an appeal duringthe unsuccessful referendum in November 1914 on woman suffrage. Written inGerman, the appeal declared, “Our German women do not want the right to vote,and since our opponents desire the right of suffrage mainly for the purpose ofsaddling the yoke of prohibition on our necks, we should oppose it with all ourmight ...”[22] [part0020.html#fn22]America’s entry into World War I provided the impetus for overcoming thesubstantial opposition to woman suffrage, as a corollary to the success ofprohibition and as a reward for the vigorous activity by organized women inbehalf of the war effort. To close the loop, much of that activity consisted instamping out vice and alcohol as well as instilling “patriotic” education intothe minds of often suspect immigrant groups.Shortly after the U.S. declaration of war, the Council of National Defensecreated an Advisory Committee on Women’s Defense Work, known as the Woman’sCommittee. The purpose of the committee, writes a celebratory contemporaryaccount, was “to coordinate the activities and the resources of the organizedand unorganized women of the country, that their power may be immediatelyutilized in time of need, and to supply a new and direct channel of cooperationbetween women and governmental department.”[23] [part0020.html#fn23] Chairman ofthe Woman’s Committee, working energetically and full time, was the formerpresident of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Dr. Anna HowardShaw, and another leading member was the suffrage group’s current chairman andan equally prominent suffragette, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt.The Woman’s Committee promptly set up organizations in cities and states acrossthe country and on June 19, 1917, convened a conference of over 50 nationalwomen’s organizations to coordinate their efforts. It was at this conferencethat “the first definite task was imposed upon American women” by theindefatigable Food Czar, Herbert Hoover.[24] [part0020.html#fn24] Hooverenlisted the cooperation of the nation’s women in his ambitious campaign forcontrolling, restricting, and cartelizing the food industry in the name of“conservation” and elimination of “waste.” Celebrating this coming together ofwomen was one of the Woman’s Committee members, the Progressive writer andmuckraker Mrs. Ida M. Tarbell. Mrs. Tarbell lauded the “growing consciousnesseverywhere that this great enterprise for democracy which we are launching [theU.S. entry into the war] is a national affair, and if an individual or a societyis going to do its bit it must act with and under the government at Washington.”“Nothing else,” Mrs. Tarbell gushed, “can explain the action of the women of thecountry in coming together as they are doing today under one centralizeddirection.”[25] [part0020.html#fn25]Mrs. Tarbell’s enthusiasm might have been heightened by the fact that she wasone of the directing rather than the directed. Herbert Hoover came to thewomen’s conference with the proposal that each of the women sign and distributea “food pledge card” on behalf of food conservation. While support for the foodpledge among the public was narrower than anticipated, educational efforts topromote the pledge became the basis of the remainder of the women’s conservationcampaign. The Woman’s Committee appointed Mrs. Tarbell as chairman of itscommittee on Food Administration, and she not only tirelessly organized thecampaign but also wrote many letters and newspaper and magazine articles on itsbehalf.In addition to food control, another important and immediate function of theWoman’s Committee was to attempt to register every woman in the country forpossible volunteer or paid work in support of the war effort. Every woman aged16 or over was asked to sign and submit a registration card with all pertinentinformation, including training, experience, and the sort of work desired. Inthat way the government would know the whereabouts and training of every woman,and government and women could then serve each other best. In many states,especially Ohio and Illinois, state governments set up schools to train theregistrars. And even though the Woman’s Committee kept insisting that theregistration was completely voluntary, the state of Louisiana, as Ida Clarkeputs it, developed a “novel and clever” idea to facilitate the program: women’sregistration was made compulsory.Louisiana’s Governor Ruffin G. Pleasant decreed October 17, 1917 compulsoryregistration day, and a host of state officials collaborated in its operation.The State Food Commission made sure that food pledges were also signed by all,and the State School Board granted a holiday on October 17 so that teacherscould assist in the compulsory registration, especially in the rural districts.Six thousand women were officially commissioned by the state of Louisiana toconduct the registration, and they worked in tandem with state Food Conservationofficials and parish Demonstration Agents. In the French areas of the state, theCatholic priests rendered valuable aid in personally appealing to all theirfemale parishioners to perform their registration duties. Handbills werecirculated in French, house-to-house canvasses were made, and speeches urgingregistration were made by women activists in movie theaters, schools, churches,and courthouses. We are informed that all responses were eager and cordial;there is no mention of any resistance. We are also advised that “even thenegroes were quite alive to the situation, meeting sometimes with the whitepeople and sometimes at the call of their own pastors.”[26] [part0020.html#fn26]Also helping out in women’s registration and food control was another, smaller,but slightly more sinister women’s organization that had been launched byCongress as a sort of prewar wartime group at a large Congress for ConstructivePatriotism, held in Washington, D.C. in late January 1917. This was the NationalLeague for Woman’s Service (NLWS), which established a nationwide organizationlater overshadowed and overlapped by the larger Woman’s Committee. Thedifference was that the NLWS was set up on quite frankly military lines. Eachlocal working unit was called a “detachment” under a “detachment commander,”district-wide and state-wide detachments met in annual “encampments,” and everywoman member was to wear a uniform with an organization badge and insignia. Inparticular, “the basis of training for all detachments is standardized, physicaldrill.”[27] [part0020.html#fn27]A vital part of the Woman’s Committee work was engaging in “patrioticeducation.” The government and the Woman’s Committee recognized that immigrantethnic women were most in need of such vital instruction, and so it set up acommittee on education, headed by the energetic Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt. Mrs.Catt stated the problem well to the Woman’s Committee: Millions of people in theUnited States were unclear on why we were at war, and why, as Ida Clarkeparaphrases Mrs. Catt, there is “the imperative necessity of winning the war iffuture generations were to be protected from the menace of an unscrupulousmilitarism.”[28] [part0020.html#fn28] Presumably U.S. militarism, being“scrupulous,” posed no problem.Apathy and ignorance abounded, Mrs. Catt went on, and she proposed to mobilize20 million American women, the “greatest sentiment makers of any community,” tobegin a “vast educational movement” to get the women “fervently enlisted to pushthe war to victory as rapidly as possible.” As Mrs. Catt continued, however, theclarity of war aims she called for really amounted to pointing out that we werein the war “whether the nation likes it or does not like it,” and that thereforethe “sacrifices” needed to win the war “willingly or unwillingly must be made.”These statements are reminiscent of arguments supporting recent military actionsby Ronald Reagan (“He had to do what he had to do”). In the end, Mrs. Catt couldcome up with only one reasoned argument for the war, apart from this allegednecessity: that it must be won to make it “the war to end wars.”[29][part0020.html#fn29]The “patriotic education” campaign of the organized women was largely to“Americanize” immigrant women by energetically persuading them (a) to becomenaturalized American citizens and (b) to learn “Mother English.” In thecampaign, dubbed “America First,” national unity was promoted through gettingimmigrants to learn English and trying to get female immigrants into afternoonor evening English classes. The organized patriot women were also worried aboutpreserving the family structure of the immigrants. If the children learn Englishand their parents remain ignorant, children will scorn their elders, “parentaldiscipline and control are dissipated, and the whole family fabric becomesweakened. Thus one of the great conservative forces in the community becomesinoperative.” To preserve “maternal control of the young,” then,“Americanization of the foreign women through language becomes imperative.” InErie, Pennsylvania, women’s clubs appointed “Block Matrons,” whose job it was toget to know the foreign families of the neighborhood and to back up schoolauthorities in urging the immigrants to learn English, and who, in the rathernaive words of Ida Clarke, “become neighbors, friends, and veritable motherconfessors to the foreign women of the block.” One would like to have heard somecomments from recipients of the attentions of the Block Matrons.All in all, as a result of the Americanization campaign, Ida Clarke concludes,“the organized women of this country can play an important part in making ours acountry with a common language, a common purpose, a common set of ideals—aunified America.”[30] [part0020.html#fn30]Neither did the government and its organized women neglect progressive economicreforms. At the organizing June 1917 conference of the Woman’s Committee, Mrs.Carrie Catt emphasized that the greatest problem of the war was to assure thatwomen receive “equal pay for equal work.” The conference suggested thatvigilance committees be established to guard against the violation of “ethicallaws” governing labor and also that all laws restricting (“protecting”) thelabor of women and children be rigorously enforced. Apparently, there were somevalues to which maximizing production for the war effort had to take secondplace. Mrs. Margaret Dreier Robins, president of the National Women’s TradeUnion’s League, hailed the fact that the Woman’s Committee was organizingcommittees in every state to protect minimum standards for women and children’slabor in industry and demanded minimum wages and shorter hours for women. Mrs.Robins particularly warned that “not only are unorganized women workers in vastnumbers used as underbidders in the labor market for lowering industrialstandards, but they are related to those groups in industrial centers of ourcountry that are least Americanized and most alien to our institutions andideals.” And so “Americanization” and cartelization of female labor went hand inhand.[31] [part0020.html#fn31][32] [part0020.html#fn32]4. SAVING OUR BOYS FROM ALCOHOL AND VICEOne of organized womanhood’s major contributions to the war effort was tocollaborate in an attempt to save American soldiers from vice and Demon Rum. Inaddition to establishing rigorous dry zones around every military camp in theUnited States, the Selective Service Act of May 1917 also outlawed prostitutionin wide zones around the military camps. To enforce these provisions, the WarDepartment had ready at hand a Commission on Training Camp Activities, an agencysoon imitated by the Department of the Navy. Both commissions were headed by aman tailor-made for the job, the progressive New York settlement-house worker,municipal political reformer, and former student and disciple of Woodrow Wilson,Raymond Blaine Fosdick.Fosdick’s background, life, and career were paradigmatic for progressiveintellectuals and activists of that era. Fosdick’s ancestors were Yankees fromMassachusetts and Connecticut, and his great-grandfather pioneered westward in acovered wagon to become a frontier farmer in the heart of the Burned-OverDistrict of transplanted Yankees, Buffalo, New York. Fosdick’s grandfather, apietist lay preacher born again in a Baptist revival, was a prohibitionist whomarried a preacher’s daughter and became a lifelong public school teacher inBuffalo. Grandfather Fosdick rose to become Superintendent of Education inBuffalo and a battler for an expanded and strengthened public school system.Fosdick’s immediate ancestry continued in the same vein. His father was a publicschool teacher in Buffalo who rose to become principal of a high school. Hismother was deeply pietist and a staunch advocate of prohibition and women’ssuffrage. Fosdick’s father was a devout pietist Protestant and a “fanatical”Republican who gave his son Raymond the middle name of his hero, the veteranMaine Republican James G. Blaine. The three Fosdick children, elder brotherHarry Emerson, Raymond, and Raymond’s twin sister, Edith, on emerging from thisatmosphere, all forged lifetime careers of pietism and social service.While active in New York reform administration, Fosdick made a fatefulfriendship. In 1910, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., like his father a pietistBaptist, was chairman of a special grand jury to investigate and to try to stampout prostitution in New York City. For Rockefeller, the elimination ofprostitution was to become an ardent and lifelong crusade. He believed that sin,such as prostitution, must be criminated, quarantined, and driven undergroundthrough rigorous suppression. In 1911, Rockefeller began his crusade by settingup the Bureau of Social Hygiene, into which he poured $5 million in the nextquarter century. Two years later he enlisted Fosdick, already a speaker at theannual dinner of Rockefeller’s Baptist Bible class, to study police systems inEurope in conjunction with activities to end the great “social vice.” SurveyingAmerican police after his stint in Europe at Rockefeller’s behest, Fosdick wasappalled that police work in the United States was not considered a “science”and that it was subject to “sordid” political influences.[33][part0020.html#fn33]At that point, the new Secretary of War, the progressive former mayor ofCleveland Newton D. Baker, became disturbed at reports that areas near the armycamps in Texas on the Mexican border, where troops were mobilized to combat theMexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, were honeycombed with saloons andprostitution. Sent by Baker on a fact-finding tour in the summer of 1916,scoffed at by tough army officers as the “Reverend,” Fosdick was horrified tofind saloons and brothels seemingly everywhere in the vicinity of the militarycamps. He reported his consternation to Baker, and, at Fosdick’s suggestion,Baker cracked down on the army commanders and their lax attitude toward alcoholand vice. But Fosdick was beginning to get the glimmer of another idea. Couldn’tthe suppression of the bad be accompanied by a positive encouragement of thegood, of wholesome recreational alternatives to sin and liquor that our boyscould enjoy? When war was declared, Baker quickly appointed Fosdick to bechairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities.Armed with the coercive resources of the federal government and rapidly buildinghis bureaucratic empire from merely one secretary to a staff of thousands,Raymond Fosdick set out with determination on his twofold task: stamping outalcohol and sin in and around every military camp, and filling the void forAmerican soldiers and sailors by providing them with wholesome recreation. Ashead of the Law Enforcement Division of the Training Camp Commission, Fosdickselected Bascom Johnson, attorney for the American Social HygieneAssociation.[34] [part0020.html#fn34] Johnson was commissioned a major, and hisstaff of 40 aggressive attorneys became second lieutenants.Employing the argument of health and military necessity, Fosdick set up a SocialHygiene Division of his commission, which promulgated the slogan “Fit to Fight.”Using a mixture of force and threats to remove federal troops from the bases ifrecalcitrant cities did not comply, Fosdick managed to bludgeon his way intosuppressing, if not prostitution in general, then at least every major red lightdistrict in the country. In doing so, Fosdick and Baker, employing local policeand the federal Military Police, far exceeded their legal authority. The lawauthorized the president to shut down every red light district in a five-milezone around each military camp or base. Of the 110 red light districts shut downby military force, however, only 35 were included in the prohibited zone.Suppression of the other 75 was an illegal extension of the law. Nevertheless,Fosdick was triumphant: “Through the efforts of this Commission [on TrainingCamp Activities] the red light district has practically ceased to be a featureof American city life.”[35] [part0020.html#fn35] The result of this permanentdestruction of the red light district, of course, was to drive prostitution ontothe streets, where consumers would be deprived of the protection of either anopen market or of regulation.In some cases, the federal anti-vice crusade met considerable resistance.Secretary of Navy Josephus Daniels, a progressive from North Carolina, had tocall out the marines to patrol the streets of resistant Philadelphia, and navaltroops, over the strenuous objections of the mayor, were used to crush thefabled red light district of Storyville, in New Orleans, in November 1917.[36][part0020.html#fn36]In its hubris, the U.S. Army decided to extend its anti-vice crusade to foreignshores. General John J. Pershing issued an official bulletin to members of theAmerican Expeditionary Force in France urging that “sexual continence is theplain duty of members of the A.E.F., both for the vigorous conduct of the war,and for the clean health of the American people after the war.” Pershing and theAmerican military tried to close all the French brothels in areas where Americantroops were located, but the move was unsuccessful because the French objectedbitterly. Premier Georges Clemenceau pointed out that the result of the “totalprohibition of regulated prostitution in the vicinity of American troops” wasonly to increase “venereal diseases among the civilian population of theneighborhood.” Finally, the United States had to rest content with declaringFrench civilian areas off limits to the troops.[37] [part0020.html#fn37]The more positive part of Raymond Fosdick’s task during the war was supplyingthe soldiers and sailors with a constructive substitute for sin and alcohol,“healthful amusements and wholesome company.” As might be expected, the Woman’sCommittee and organized womanhood collaborated enthusiastically. They followedthe injunction of Secretary of War Baker that the government “cannot allowthese ... young men to be surrounded by a vicious and demoralizing environment,nor can we leave anything undone which will protect them from unhealthyinfluences and crude forms of temptation.” The Woman’s Committee found, however,that in the great undertaking of safeguarding the health and morals of our boys,their most challenging problem proved to be guarding the morals of theirmobilized young girls. For unfortunately, “where soldiers are stationed ... theproblem of preventing girls from being misled by the glamour and romance of warand beguiling uniforms looms large.” Fortunately, perhaps, the MarylandCommittee proposed the establishment of a “Patriotic League of Honor which willinspire girls to adopt the highest standards of womanliness and loyalty to theircountry.”[38] [part0020.html#fn38]No group was more delighted with the achievements of Fosdick and his MilitaryTraining Camp Commission than the burgeoning profession of social work.Surrounded by handpicked aides from the Playground and Recreation Associationand the Russell Sage Foundation, Fosdick and the others “in effect tried tocreate a massive settlement house around each camp. No army had ever seenanything like it before, but it was an outgrowth of the recreation and communityorganization movement, and a victory for those who had been arguing for thecreative use of leisure time.”[39] [part0020.html#fn39] The social workprofession pronounced the program an enormous success. The influential Surveymagazine summed up the result as “the most stupendous piece of social work inmodern times.”[40] [part0020.html#fn40]Social workers were also exultant about prohibition. In 1917, the NationalConference of Charities and Corrections (which changed its name around the sametime to the National Conference of Social Work) was emboldened to drop whatevervalue-free pose it might have had and come out squarely for prohibition. Onreturning from Russia in 1917, Edward T. Devine of the Charity OrganizationSociety of New York exclaimed that “the social revolution which followed theprohibition of vodka was more profoundly important ... than the politicalrevolution which abolished autocracy.” And Robert A. Woods of Boston, the GrandOld Man of the settlement house movement and a veteran advocate of prohibition,predicted in 1919 that the 18th Amendment, “one of the greatest and best eventsin history,” would reduce poverty, wipe out prostitution and crime, and liberate“vast suppressed human potentialities.”[41] [part0020.html#fn41]Woods, president of the National Conference of Social Work during 1917–18, hadlong denounced alcohol as “an abominable evil.” A postmillennial pietist, hebelieved in “Christian statesmanship” that would, in a “propaganda of the deed,”Christianize the social order in a corporate, communal route to theglorification of God. Like many pietists, Woods cared not for creeds or dogmasbut only for advancing Christianity in a communal way; though an activeEpiscopalian, his “parish” was the community at large. In his settlement work,Woods had long favored the isolation or segregation of the “unfit,” inparticular “the tramp, the drunkard, the pauper, the imbecile,” with thesettlement house as the nucleus of this reform. Woods was particularly eager toisolate and punish the drunkard and the tramp. “Inveterate drunkards” were toreceive increasing levels of “punishment,” with ever-lengthier jail terms. The“tramp evil” was to be gotten rid of by rounding up and jailing vagrants, whowould be placed in tramp workhouses and put to forced labor.For Woods the world war was a momentous event. It had advanced the process of“Americanization,” a “great humanizing process through which all loyalties, allbeliefs must be wrought together in a better order.”[42] [part0020.html#fn42]The war had wonderfully released the energies of the American people. Now,however, it was important to carry the wartime momentum into the postwar world.Lauding the war collectivist society during the spring of 1918, Robert Woodsasked the crucial question, “Why should it not always be so? Why not continue inthe years of peace this close, vast, wholesome organism of service, offellowship, of constructive creative power?”[43] [part0020.html#fn43]5. THE NEW REPUBLIC COLLECTIVISTSThe New Republic magazine, founded in 1914 as the leading intellectual organ ofprogressivism, was a living embodiment of the burgeoning alliance betweenbig-business interests, in particular the House of Morgan, and the growinglegion of collectivist intellectuals. Founder and publisher of the New Republicwas Willard D. Straight, partner of J.P. Morgan & Co., and its financier wasStraight’s wife, the heiress Dorothy Whitney. Major editor of the influentialnew weekly was the veteran collectivist and theoretician of Teddy Roosevelt’sNew Nationalism, Herbert David Croly. Croly’s two coeditors were Walter EdwardWeyl, another theoretician of the New Nationalism, and the young, ambitiousformer official of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, the future punditWalter Lippmann. As Woodrow Wilson began to take America into World War I, theNew Republic, though originally Rooseveltian, became an enthusiastic supporterof the war, and a virtual spokesman for the Wilson war effort, the wartimecollectivist economy, and the new society molded by the war.On the higher levels of ratiocination, unquestionably the leading progressiveintellectual, before, during, and after World War I, was the champion ofpragmatism, Professor John Dewey of Columbia University. Dewey wrote frequentlyfor the New Republic in this period and was clearly its leading theoretician. AYankee born in 1859, Dewey was, as Mencken put it, “of indestructible Vermontstock and a man of the highest bearable sobriety.” John Dewey was the son of asmall town Vermont grocer.[44] [part0020.html#fn44] Although he was a pragmatistand a secular humanist most of his life, it is not as well known that Dewey, inthe years before 1900, was a postmillennial pietist, seeking the gradualdevelopment of a Christianized social order and Kingdom of God on earth via theexpansion of science, community, and the State. During the 1890s, Dewey, asprofessor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, expounded his vision ofpostmillennial pietism in a series of lectures before the Students’ ChristianAssociation. Dewey argued that the growth of modern science now makes itpossible for man to establish the biblical idea of the Kingdom of God on earth.Once humans had broken free of the restraints of orthodox Christianity, a trulyreligious Kingdom of God could be realized in “the common incarnate Life, thepurpose ... animating all men and binding them together into one harmoniouswhole of sympathy.”[45] [part0020.html#fn45] Religion would thus work in tandemwith science and democracy, all of which would break down the barriers betweenmen and establish the Kingdom. After 1900 it was easy for John Dewey, along withmost other postmillennial intellectuals of the period, to shift gradually butdecisively from postmillennial progressive Christian statism to progressivesecular statism. The path, the expansion of statism and “social control” andplanning, remained the same. And even though the Christian creed dropped out ofthe picture, the intellectuals and activists continued to possess the sameevangelical zeal for the salvation of the world that their parents and theythemselves had once possessed. The world would and must still be saved throughprogress and statism.[46] [part0020.html#fn46]A pacifist while in the midst of peace, John Dewey prepared himself to lead theparade for war as America drew nearer to armed intervention in the Europeanstruggle. First, in January 1916 in the New Republic, Dewey attacked the“professional pacifist’s” outright condemnation of war as a “sentimentalphantasy,” a confusion of means and ends. Force, he declared, was simply “ameans of getting results,” and therefore would neither be lauded nor condemnedper se. Next, in April Dewey signed a pro-Allied manifesto, not only cheeringfor an Allied victory but also proclaiming that the Allies were “struggling topreserve the liberties of the world and the highest ideals of civilization.” Andthough Dewey supported U.S. entry into the war so that Germany could bedefeated, “a hard job, but one which had to be done,” he was far more interestedin the wonderful changes that the war would surely bring about in the domesticAmerican polity. In particular, war offered a golden opportunity to bring aboutcollectivist social control in the interest of social justice. As one historianput it,> because war demanded paramount commitment to the national interest and> necessitated an unprecedented degree of government planning and economic> regulation in that interest, Dewey saw the prospect of permanent> socialization, permanent replacement of private and possessive interest by> public and social interest, both within and among nations.[47]> [part0020.html#fn47]In an interview with the New York World a few months after U.S. entry into thewar, Dewey exulted that “this war may easily be the beginning of the end ofbusiness.” For out of the needs of the war, “we are beginning to produce foruse, not for sale, and the capitalist is not a capitalist ... [in the face of]the war.” Capitalist conditions of production and sale are now under governmentcontrol, and “there is no reason to believe that the old principle will ever beresumed. ... Private property had already lost its sanctity ... industrialdemocracy is on the way.”[48] [part0020.html#fn48] In short, intelligence is atlast being used to tackle social problems, and this practice is destroying theold order and creating a new social order of “democratic integrated control.”Labor is acquiring more power, science is at last being socially mobilized, andmassive government controls are socializing industry. These developments, Deweyproclaimed, were precisely what we are fighting for.[49] [part0020.html#fn49]Furthermore, John Dewey saw great possibilities opened by the war for the adventof worldwide collectivism. To Dewey, America’s entrance into the war created a“plastic juncture” in the world, a world marked by a “world organization and thebeginnings of a public control which crosses nationalistic boundaries andinterests,” and which would also “outlaw war.”[50] [part0020.html#fn50]The editors of the New Republic took a position similar to Dewey’s, except thatthey arrived at it even earlier. In his editorial in the magazine’s first issuein November 1914, Herbert Croly cheerily prophesied that the war would stimulateAmerica’s spirit of nationalism and therefore bring it closer to democracy. Atfirst hesitant about the collectivist war economies in Europe, the New Republicsoon began to cheer and urged the United States to follow the lead of thewarring European nations and socialize its economy and expand the powers of theState. As America prepared to enter the war, the New Republic, examining warcollectivism in Europe, rejoiced that “on its administrative side socialism[had] won a victory that [was] superb and compelling.” True, European warcollectivism was a bit grim and autocratic, but never fear, America could usethe selfsame means for “democratic” goals.The New Republic intellectuals also delighted in the “war spirit” in America,for that spirit meant “the substitution of national and social and organicforces for the more or less mechanical private forces operative in peace. ...”The purposes of war and social reform might be a bit different, but, after all,“they are both purposes, and luckily for mankind a social organization which isefficient is as useful for the one as for the other.”[51] [part0020.html#fn51]Lucky indeed.As America prepared to enter the war, the New Republic eagerly looked forward toimminent collectivization, sure that it would bring “immense gains in nationalefficiency and happiness.” After war was declared, the magazine urged that thewar be used as “an aggressive tool of democracy.” “Why should not the warserve,” the magazine asked, “as a pretext to be used to foist innovations uponthe country?” In that way, progressive intellectuals could lead the way inabolishing “the typical evils of the sprawling half-educated competitivecapitalism.”Convinced that the United States would attain socialism through war, WalterLippmann, in a public address shortly after American entry, trumpeted hisapocalyptic vision of the future:> We who have gone to war to insure democracy in the world will have raised an> aspiration here that will not end with the overthrow of the Prussian> autocracy. We shall turn with fresh interests to our own tyrannies—to our> Colorado mines, our autocratic steel industries, sweatshops, and our slums. A> force is loose in America. ... Our own reactionaries will not assuage it. ...> We shall know how to deal with them.[52] [part0020.html#fn52]Walter Lippmann, indeed, had been the foremost hawk among the New Republicintellectuals. He had pushed Croly into backing Wilson and into supportingintervention, and then had collaborated with Colonel House in pushing Wilsoninto entering the war. Soon Lippmann, an enthusiast for conscription, had toconfront the fact that he himself, only 27 years old and in fine health, waseminently eligible for the draft. Somehow, however, Lippmann failed to unitetheory and praxis. Young Felix Frankfurter, progressive Harvard Law Professorand a close associate of the New Republic editorial staff, had just beenselected as a special assistant to Secretary of War Baker. Lippmann somehow feltthat his own inestimable services could be better used planning the postwarworld than battling in the trenches. And so he wrote to Frankfurter asking for ajob in Baker’s office. “What I want to do,” he pleaded, “is to devote all mytime to studying and speculating on the approaches to peace and the reactionfrom the peace. Do you think you can get me an exemption on such high-falutingrounds?” He then rushed to reassure Frankfurter that there was nothing“personal” in this request. After all, he explained, “the things that need to bethought out, are so big that there must be no personal element mixed up withthis.” Frankfurter having paved the way, Lippmann wrote to Secretary Baker. Heassured Baker that he was only applying for a job and draft exemption on thepleading of others and in stern submission to the national interest. As Lippmannput it in a remarkable demonstration of cant:> I have consulted all the people whose advice I value and they urge me to apply> for exemption. You can well understand that this is not a pleasant thing to> do, and yet, after searching my soul as candidly as I know how, I am convinced> that I can serve my bit much more effectively than as a private in the new> armies.No doubt.As icing on the cake, Lippmann added an important bit of “disinformation.” For,he piteously wrote to Baker, the fact is “that my father is dying and my motheris absolutely alone in the world. She does not know what his condition is, and Icannot tell anyone for fear it would become known.” Apparently, no one else“knew” his father’s condition either, including his father and the medicalprofession, for the elder Lippmann managed to peg along successfully for thenext ten years.[53] [part0020.html#fn53]Secure in his draft exemption, Walter Lippmann hied off in high excitement toWashington, there to help run the war and, a few months later, to help directColonel House’s secret conclave of historians and social scientists setting outto plan the shape of the future peace treaty and the postwar world. Let othersfight and die in the trenches; Walter Lippmann had the satisfaction of knowingthat his talents, at least, would be put to their best use by the newly emergingcollectivist State.As the war went on, Croly and the other editors, having lost Lippmann to thegreat world beyond, cheered every new development of the massively controlledwar economy. The nationalization of railroads and shipping, the priorities andallocation system, the total domination of all parts of the food industryachieved by Herbert Hoover and the Food Administration, the pro-union policy,the high taxes, and the draft were all hailed by the New Republic as anexpansion of democracy’s power to plan for the general good. As the Armisticeushered in the postwar world, the New Republic looked back on the handiwork ofthe war and found it good: “We revolutionized our society.” All that remainedwas to organize a new constitutional convention to complete the job ofreconstructing America.[54] [part0020.html#fn54]But the revolution had not been fully completed. Despite the objections ofBernard Baruch and other wartime planners, the government decided not to makemost of the war collectivist machinery permanent. From then on, the fondestambition of Baruch and the others was to make the World War I system a permanentinstitution of American life. The most trenchant epitaph on the World War Ipolity was delivered by Rexford Guy Tugwell, the most frankly collectivist ofthe Brain Trusters of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. Looking back on “America’swartime socialism” in 1927, Tugwell lamented that if only the war had lastedlonger, that great “experiment” could have been completed: “We were on the vergeof having an international industrial machine when peace broke,” Tugwellmourned. “Only the Armistice prevented a great experiment in control ofproduction, control of prices, and control of consumption.”[55][part0020.html#fn55] Tugwell need not have been troubled; there would soon beother emergencies, other wars.At the end of the war, Lippmann was to go on to become America’s foremostjournalistic pundit. Croly, having broken with the Wilson administration on theharshness of the Versailles Treaty, was bereft to find the New Republic nolonger the spokesman for some great political leader. During the late 1920s hewas to discover an exemplary national collectivist leader abroad—in BenitoMussolini.[56] [part0020.html#fn56] That Croly ended his years as an admirer ofMussolini comes as no surprise when we realize that from early childhood he hadbeen steeped by a doting father in the authoritarian socialist doctrines ofAuguste Comte’s Positivism. These views were to mark Croly throughout his life.Thus, Herbert’s father, David, the founder of Positivism in the United States,advocated the establishment of vast powers of government over everyone’s life.David Croly favored the growth of trusts and monopolies as a means both to thatend and also to eliminate the evils of individual competition and “selfishness.”Like his son, David Croly railed at the Jeffersonian “fear of government” inAmerica and looked to Hamilton as an example to counter that trend.[57][part0020.html#fn57]And what of Professor Dewey, the doyen of the pacifistintellectuals-turned-drumbeaters for war? In a little known period of his life,John Dewey spent the immediate postwar years, 1919–21, teaching at PekingUniversity and traveling in the Far East. China was then in a period of turmoilover the clauses of the Versailles Treaty that transferred the rights ofdominance in Shantung from Germany to Japan. Japan had been promised this rewardby the British and French in secret treaties in return for entering the waragainst Germany. The Wilson administration was torn between the two camps. Onthe one hand were those who wished to stand by the Allies’ decision and whoenvisioned using Japan as a club against Bolshevik Russia in Asia. On the otherwere those who had already begun to sound the alarm about a Japanese menace andwho were committed to China, often because of connections with the AmericanProtestant missionaries who wished to defend and expand their extraterritorialpowers of governance in China. The Wilson administration, which had originallytaken a pro-Chinese stand, reversed itself in the spring of 1919 and endorsedthe Versailles provisions.Into this complex situation John Dewey plunged, seeing no complexity and ofcourse considering it unthinkable for either him or the United States to stayout of the entire fray. Dewey leaped into total support of the Chinesenationalist position, hailing the aggressive Young China movement and evenendorsing the pro-missionary YMCA in China as “social workers.” Dewey thunderedthat while “I didn’t expect to be a jingo,” Japan must be called to account, andJapan is the great menace in Asia. Thus, scarcely had Dewey ceased being achampion of one terrible world war than he began to pave the way for an evengreater one.[58] [part0020.html#fn58]6. ECONOMICS IN SERVICE OF THE STATE: THE EMPIRICISM OF RICHARD T. ELYWorld War I was the apotheosis of the growing notion of intellectuals asservants of the State and junior partners in State rule. In the new fusion ofintellectuals and State, each was of powerful aid to the other. Intellectualscould serve the State by apologizing for and supplying rationales for its deeds.Intellectuals were also needed to staff important positions as planners andcontrollers of the society and economy. The State could also serve intellectualsby restricting entry into, and thereby raising the income and the prestige of,the various occupations and professions. During World War I, historians were ofparticular importance in supplying the government with war propaganda,convincing the public of the unique evil of Germans throughout history and ofthe satanic designs of the Kaiser. Economists, particularly empirical economistsand statisticians, were of great importance in the planning and control of thenation’s wartime economy. Historians playing preeminent roles in the warpropaganda machine have been studied fairly extensively; economists andstatisticians, playing a less blatant and allegedly “value-free” role, havereceived far less attention.[59] [part0020.html#fn59]Although it is an outworn generalization to say that 19th century economistswere stalwart champions of laissez-faire, it is still true that deductiveeconomic theory proved to be a mighty bulwark against government intervention.For, basically, economic theory showed the harmony and order inherent in thefree market, as well as the counterproductive distortions and economic shacklesimposed by state intervention. In order for statism to dominate the economicsprofession, then, it was important to discredit deductive theory. One of themost important ways of doing so was to advance the notion that, to be “genuinelyscientific,” economics had to eschew generalization and deductive laws andsimply engage in empirical inquiry into the facts of history and historicalinstitutions, hoping that somehow laws would eventually arise from thesedetailed investigations. Thus the German Historical School, which managed toseize control of the economics discipline in Germany, fiercely proclaimed notonly its devotion to statism and government control, but also its opposition tothe “abstract” deductive laws of political economy. This was the first majorgroup within the economics profession to champion what Ludwig von Mises waslater to call “anti-economics.” Gustav Schmoller, the leader of the HistoricalSchool, proudly declared that his and his colleagues’ major task at theUniversity of Berlin was to form “the intellectual bodyguard of the House ofHohenzollern.”During the 1880s and 1890s bright young graduate students in history and thesocial sciences went to Germany, the home of the Ph.D. degree, to obtain theirdoctorates. Almost to a man, they returned to the United States to teach incolleges and in the newly created graduate schools, imbued with the excitementof the “new” economics and political science. It was a “new” social science thatlauded the German and Bismarckian development of a powerful welfare-warfareState—a State seemingly above all social classes—that fused the nation into anintegrated and allegedly harmonious whole. The new society and polity was to berun by a powerful central government—cartelizing, dictating, arbitrating, andcontrolling—thereby eliminating competitive laissez-faire capitalism on the onehand and the threat of proletarian socialism on the other. And at or near thehead of the new dispensation was to be the new breed of intellectuals,technocrats, and planners, directing, staffing, propagandizing, and “selflessly”promoting the common good while ruling and lording over the rest of society. Inshort, doing well by doing good. To the new breed of progressive and statistintellectuals in America, this was a heady vision indeed.Richard T. Ely, virtually the founder of this new breed, was the leadingprogressive economist and also the teacher of most of the others. As an ardentpostmillennialist pietist, Ely was convinced that he was serving God and Christas well. Like so many pietists, Ely was born (in 1854) of solid Yankee and oldPuritan stock, again in the midst of the fanatical Burned-Over District ofwestern New York. Ely’s father, Ezra, was an extreme Sabbatarian, preventing hisfamily from playing games or reading books on Sunday, and so ardent aprohibitionist that, even though an impoverished, marginal farmer, he refused togrow barley, a crop uniquely suitable to his soil, because it would have beenused to make that monstrously sinful product, beer.[60] [part0020.html#fn60]Having been graduated from Columbia College in 1876, Ely went to Germany andreceived his Ph.D. from Heidelberg in 1879. In several decades of teaching atJohns Hopkins and then at Wisconsin, the energetic and empire-building Elybecame enormously influential in American thought and politics. At Johns Hopkinshe turned out a gallery of influential students and statist disciples in allfields of the social sciences as well as economics. These disciples were headedby the pro-union institutionalist economist John R. Commons and included thesocial-control sociologists Edward Alsworth Ross and Albion W. Small, John H.Finlay, president of City College of New York, Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of theReview of Reviews and influential adviser and theoretician to TheodoreRoosevelt, the municipal reformer Frederick C. Howe, and the historiansFrederick Jackson Turner and J. Franklin Jameson. Newton D. Baker was trained byEly at Hopkins, and Woodrow Wilson was also his student there, although there isno direct evidence of intellectual influence.In the mid-1880s Richard Ely founded the American Economic Association in aconscious attempt to commit the economics profession to statism as against theolder laissez-faire economists grouped in the Political Economy Club. Elycontinued as secretary-treasurer of the AEA for seven years, until his reformerallies decided to weaken the association’s commitment to statism in order toinduce the laissez-faire economists to join the organization. At that point,Ely, in high dudgeon, left the AEA.At Wisconsin in 1892, Ely formed a new School of Economics, Political Science,and History, surrounded himself with former students, and gave birth to theWisconsin Idea which, with the help of John Commons, succeeded in passing a hostof progressive measures for government regulation in Wisconsin. Ely and theothers formed an unofficial but powerful brain trust for the progressive regimeof Wisconsin Governor Robert M. La Follette, who got his start in Wisconsinpolitics as an advocate of prohibition. Though never a classroom student ofEly’s, La Follette always referred to Ely as his teacher and as the molder ofthe Wisconsin Idea. And Theodore Roosevelt once declared that Ely “firstintroduced me to radicalism in economics and then made me sane in myradicalism.”[61] [part0020.html#fn61]Ely was also one of the most prominent postmillennialist intellectuals of theera. He fervently believed that the State is God’s chosen instrument forreforming and Christianizing the social order so that eventually Jesus wouldarrive and put an end to history. The State, declared Ely, “is religious in itsessence,” and, furthermore, “God works through the State in carrying out Hispurposes more universally than through any other institution.” The task of thechurch is to guide the State and utilize it in these needed reforms.[62][part0020.html#fn62]An inveterate activist and organizer, Ely was prominent in the evangelicalChautauqua movement, and he founded there the “Christian Sociology” summerschool, which infused the influential Chautauqua operation with the concepts andthe personnel of the Social Gospel movement. Ely was a friend and closeassociate of Social Gospel leaders Revs. Washington Gladden, WalterRauschenbusch, and Josiah Strong. With Strong and Commons, Ely organized theInstitute of Christian Sociology.[63] [part0020.html#fn63] Ely also founded andbecame the secretary of the Christian Social Union of the Episcopal Church,along with Christian Socialist W.D.P. Bliss. All of these activities wereinfused with postmillennial statism. Thus, the Institute of Christian Sociologywas pledged to present God’s “kingdom as the complete ideal of human society tobe realized on earth.” Moreover,> Ely viewed the state as the greatest redemptive force in society. ... In Ely’s> eyes, government was the God-given instrument through which we had to work.> Its preeminence as a divine instrument was based on the post-Reformation> abolition of the division between the sacred and the secular and on the> State’s power to implement ethical solutions to public problems. The same> identification of sacred and secular which took place among liberal clergy> enabled Ely to both divinize the state and socialize Christianity: he thought> of government as God’s main instrument of redemption.[64] [part0020.html#fn64]When war came, Richard Ely was for some reason (perhaps because he was in hissixties) left out of the excitement of war work and economic planning inWashington. He bitterly regretted that “I have not had a more active part than Ihave had in this greatest war in the world’s history.”[65] [part0020.html#fn65]But Ely made up for his lack as best he could; virtually from the start of theEuropean war, he whooped it up for militarism, war, the “discipline” ofconscription, and the suppression of dissent and “disloyalty” at home. Alifelong militarist, Ely had tried to volunteer for war service in theSpanish-American War, had called for the suppression of the Philippineinsurrection, and was particularly eager for conscription and for forced laborfor “loafers” during World War I. By 1915 Ely was agitating for immediatecompulsory military service, and the following year he joined the ardentlypro-war and heavily big-business–influenced National Security League, where hecalled for the liberation of the German people from “autocracy.”[66][part0020.html#fn66] In advocating conscription, Ely was neatly able to combinemoral, economic, and prohibitionist arguments for the draft: “The moral effectof taking boys off street corners and out of saloons and drilling them isexcellent, and the economic effects are likewise beneficial.”[67][part0020.html#fn67] Indeed, conscription for Ely served almost as a panacea forall ills. So enthusiastic was he about the World War I experience that Ely againprescribed his favorite cure-all to alleviate the 1929 depression. He proposed apermanent peacetime “industrial army” engaged in public works and manned byconscripting youth for strenuous physical labor. This conscription would instillinto America’s youth the essential “military ideals of hardihood anddiscipline,” a discipline once provided by life on the farm but unavailable tothe bulk of the populace now growing up in the effete cities. This small,standing conscript army could then speedily absorb the unemployed duringdepressions. Under the command of “an economic general staff,” the industrialarmy would “go to work to relieve distress with all the vigor and resources ofbrain and brawn that we employed in the World War.”[68] [part0020.html#fn68]Deprived of a position in Washington, Ely made the stamping out of “disloyalty”at home his major contribution to the war effort. He called for the totalsuspension of academic freedom for the duration. Any professor, he declared, whostated “opinions which hinder us in this awful struggle” should be “fired” ifnot indeed “shot.” The particular focus of Ely’s formidable energy was a zealouscampaign to try to get his old ally in Wisconsin politics, Robert M. LaFollette, expelled from the U.S. Senate for continuing to oppose America’sparticipation in the war. Ely declared that his “blood boils” at La Follette’s“treason” and attacks on war profiteering. Throwing himself into the battle, Elyfounded and became president of the Madison chapter of the Wisconsin LoyaltyLegion and mounted a campaign to expel La Follette.[69] [part0020.html#fn69] Thecampaign was meant to mobilize the Wisconsin faculty and to support theultrapatriotic and ultrahawkish activities of Theodore Roosevelt. Ely wrote toT.R. that “we must crush La Follettism.” In his unremitting campaign against theWisconsin Senator, Ely thundered that La Follette “has been of more help to theKaiser than a quarter of a million troops.”[70] [part0020.html#fn70]“Empiricism” rampant.The faculty of the University of Wisconsin was stung by charges throughout thestate and the country that its failure to denounce La Follette was proof thatthe university—long affiliated with La Follette in state politics—supported hisdisloyal antiwar policies. Prodded by Ely, Commons, and others, the university’sWar Committee drew up and circulated a petition, signed by the universitypresident, all the deans, and over 90% of the faculty, that provided one of themore striking examples in United States history of academic truckling to theState apparatus. None too subtly using the constitutional verbiage for treason,the petition protested “against those utterances and actions of Senator LaFollette which have given aid and comfort to Germany and her allies in thepresent war; we deplore his failure loyally to support the government in theprosecution of the war.”[71] [part0020.html#fn71]Behind the scenes, Ely tried his best to mobilize America’s historians againstLa Follette, to demonstrate that he had given aid and comfort to the enemy. Elywas able to enlist the services of the National Board of Historical Service, thepropaganda agency established by professional historians for the duration of thewar, and of the government’s own propaganda arm, the Committee on PublicInformation. Warning that the effort must remain secret, Ely mobilizedhistorians under the aegis of these organizations to research German andAustrian newspapers and journals to try to build a record of La Follette’salleged influence, “indicating the encouragement he has given Germany.” Thehistorian E. Merton Coulter revealed the objective spirit animating theseresearches: “I understand it is to be an unbiased and candid account of theSenator’s [La Follette’s] course and its effect—but we all know it can lead butto one conclusion—something little short of treason.”[72] [part0020.html#fn72]Professor Gruber well notes that this campaign to get La Follette was “aremarkable example of the uses of scholarship for espionage. It was a far cryfrom the disinterested search for truth for a group of professors to mobilize asecret research campaign to find ammunition to destroy the political career of aUnited States senator who did not share their view of the war.”[73][part0020.html#fn73] In any event, no evidence was turned up, the movementfailed, and the Wisconsin professoriat began to move away in distrust from theLoyalty Legion.[74] [part0020.html#fn74]After the menace of the Kaiser had been extirpated, the Armistice foundProfessor Ely, along with his compatriots in the National Security League, readyto segue into the next round of patriotic repression. During Ely’s anti–LaFollette research campaign he had urged investigation of “the kind of influencewhich he [La Follette] has exerted against our country in Russia.” Ely pointedout that modern “democracy” requires a “high degree of conformity” and thattherefore the “most serious menace” of Bolshevism, which Ely depicted as “socialdisease germs,” must be fought “with repressive measures.”By 1924, however, Richard T. Ely’s career of repression was over, and what ismore, in a rare instance of the workings of poetic justice, he was hoisted withhis own petard. In 1922 the much-traduced Robert La Follette was reelected tothe Senate and also swept the Progressives back into power in the state ofWisconsin. By 1924 the Progressives had gained control of the Board of Regents,and they moved to cut off the water of their former academic ally andempire-builder. Ely then felt it prudent to move out of Wisconsin together withhis Institute, and while he lingered for some years at Northwestern, the heydayof Ely’s fame and fortune was over.7. ECONOMICS IN SERVICE OF THE STATE: GOVERNMENT AND STATISTICSStatistics is a vital, though much underplayed, requisite of modern government.Government could not even presume to control, regulate, or plan any portion ofthe economy without the service of its statistical bureaus and agencies. Deprivegovernment of its statistics and it would be a blind and helpless giant, with noidea whatever of what to do or where to do it. It might be replied that businessfirms, too, need statistics in order to function. But business needs forstatistics are far less in quantity and also different in quality. Business mayneed statistics in its own micro area of the economy, but only on its prices andcosts; it has little need for broad collections of data or for sweeping,holistic aggregates. Business could perhaps rely on its own privately collectedand unshared data. Furthermore, much entrepreneurial knowledge is qualitative,not enshrined in quantitative data, and of a particular time, area, andlocation. But government bureaucracy could do nothing if forced to be confinedto qualitative data. Deprived of profit and loss tests for efficiency, or of theneed to serve consumers efficiently, conscripting both capital and operatingcosts from taxpayers, and forced to abide by fixed, bureaucratic rules, moderngovernment shorn of masses of statistics could do virtually nothing.[75][part0020.html#fn75]Hence the enormous importance of World War I, not only in providing the powerand the precedent for a collectivized economy, but also in greatly acceleratingthe advent of statisticians and statistical agencies of government, many ofwhich (and who) remained in government, ready for the next leap forward ofpower.Richard T. Ely, of course, championed the new empirical “look and see” approach,with the aim of fact-gathering to “mold the forces at work in society and toimprove existing conditions.”[76] [part0020.html#fn76] More importantly, one ofthe leading authorities on the growth of government expenditure has linked itwith statistics and empirical data: “Advance in economic science andstatistics ... strengthened belief in the possibilities of dealing with socialproblems by collective action. It made for increase in the statistical and otherfact-finding activities of government.”[77] [part0020.html#fn77] As early as1863, Samuel B. Ruggles, American delegate to the International StatisticalCongress in Berlin, proclaimed that “statistics are the very eyes of thestatesman, enabling him to survey and scan with clear and comprehensive visionthe whole structure and economy of the body politic.”[78] [part0020.html#fn78]Conversely, this means that stripped of these means of vision, the statesmanwould no longer be able to meddle, control, and plan.Moreover, government statistics are clearly needed for specific types ofintervention. Government could not intervene to alleviate unemployment unlessstatistics of unemployment were collected—and so the impetus for suchcollection. Carroll D. Wright, one of the first Commissioners of Labor in theUnited States, was greatly influenced by the famous statistician and GermanHistorical School member, Ernst Engel, head of the Royal Statistical Bureau ofPrussia. Wright sought the collection of unemployment statistics for that reasonand, in general, for “the amelioration of unfortunate industrial and socialrelations.” Henry Carter Adams, a former student of Engel, and, like Ely, astatist and progressive “new economist,” established the Statistical Bureau ofthe Interstate Commerce Commission, believing that “ever increasing statisticalactivity by the government was essential—for the sake of controlling naturallymonopolistic industries. ...” And Professor Irving Fisher of Yale, eager forgovernment to stabilize the price level, conceded that he wrote The Making ofIndex Numbers to solve the problem of the unreliability of index numbers. “Untilthis difficulty could be met, stabilization could scarcely be expected to becomea reality.”Carroll Wright was a Bostonian and a progressive reformer. Henry Carter Adams,the son of a New England pietist Congregationalist preacher on missionary dutyin Iowa, studied for the ministry at his father’s alma mater, AndoverTheological Seminary, but soon abandoned this path. Adams devised the accountingsystem of the Statistical Bureau of the ICC. This system “served as a model forthe regulation of public utilities here and throughout the world.”[79][part0020.html#fn79]Irving Fisher was the son of a Rhode Island Congregationalist pietist preacher,and his parents were both of old Yankee stock, his mother a strict Sabbatarian.As befitted what his son and biographer called his “crusading spirit,” Fisherwas an inveterate reformer, urging the imposition of numerous progressivemeasures including Esperanto, simplified spelling, and calendar reform. He wasparticularly enthusiastic about purging the world of “such iniquities ofcivilization as alcohol, tea, coffee, tobacco, refined sugar, and bleached whiteflour. ...”[80] [part0020.html#fn80] During the 1920s Fisher was the leadingprophet of that so-called New Era in economics and in society. He wrote threebooks during the 1920s praising the noble experiment of prohibition, and helauded Governor Benjamin Strong and the Federal Reserve System for following hisadvice and expanding money and credit so as to keep the wholesale price levelvirtually constant. Because of the Fed’s success in imposing Fisherine pricestabilization, Fisher was so sure that there could be no depression that as lateas 1930 he wrote a book claiming that there was and could be no stock crash andthat stock prices would quickly rebound. Throughout the 1920s Fisher insistedthat since wholesale prices remained constant, there was nothing amiss about thewild boom in stocks. Meanwhile he put his theories into practice by heavilyinvesting his heiress wife’s considerable fortune in the stock market. After thecrash he frittered away his sister-in-law’s money when his wife’s fortune wasdepleted, at the same time calling frantically on the federal government toinflate money and credit and to re-inflate stock prices to their 1929 levels.Despite his dissipation of two family fortunes, Fisher managed to blame almosteveryone except himself for the debacle.[81] [part0020.html#fn81]As we shall see, in view of the importance of Wesley Clair Mitchell in theburgeoning of government statistics in World War I, Mitchell’s view onstatistics are of particular importance.[82] [part0020.html#fn82] Mitchell, aninstitutionalist and student of Thorstein Veblen, was one of the prime foundersof modern statistical inquiry in economics and clearly aspired to lay the basisfor “scientific” government planning. As Professor Dorfman, friend and studentof Mitchell’s, put it:> “clearly the type of social invention most needed today is one that offers> definite techniques through which the social system can be controlled and> operated to the optimum advantage of its members.” (Quote from Mitchell.) To> this end he constantly sought to extend, improve and refine the gathering and> compilation of data. ... Mitchell believed that business-cycle analysis ...> might indicate the means to the achievement of orderly social control of> business activity.[83] [part0020.html#fn83]Or, as Mitchell’s wife and collaborator stated in her memoirs:> ... he [Mitchell] envisioned the great contribution that government could make> to the understanding of economic and social problems if the statistical data> gathered independently by various Federal agencies were systematized and> planned so that the interrelationships among them could be studied. The idea> of developing social statistics, not merely as a record but as a basis for> planning, emerged early in his own work.[84] [part0020.html#fn84]Particularly important in the expansion of statistics in World War I was thegrowing insistence, by progressive intellectuals and corporate liberalbusinessmen alike, that democratic decision-making must be increasingly replacedby the administrative and technocratic. Democratic or legislative decisions weremessy, “inefficient,” and might lead to a significant curbing of statism, as hadhappened in the heyday of the Democratic Party during the 19th century. But ifdecisions were largely administrative and technocratic, the burgeoning of statepower could continue unchecked. The collapse of the laissez-faire creed of theDemocrats in 1896 left a power vacuum in government that administrative andcorporatist types were eager to fill. Increasingly, then, such powerfulcorporatist big business groups as the National Civic Federation disseminatedthe idea that governmental decisions should be in the hands of the efficienttechnician, the allegedly value-free expert. In short, government, in virtuallyall of its aspects, should be “taken out of politics.” And statistical researchwith its aura of empiricism, quantitative precision, and nonpoliticalvalue-freedom, was in the forefront of such emphasis. In the municipalities, anincreasingly powerful progressive reform movement shifted decisions fromelections in neighborhood wards to citywide professional managers and schoolsuperintendents. As a corollary, political power was increasingly shifted fromworking class and ethnic German Lutheran and Catholic wards to upper-classpietist business groups.[85] [part0020.html#fn85]By the time World War I arrived in Europe, a coalition of progressiveintellectuals and corporatist businessmen was ready to go national in sponsoringallegedly objective statistical research institutes and think tanks. Their viewshave been aptly summed up by David Eakins:> The conclusion being drawn by these people by 1915 was that fact-finding and> policymaking had to be isolated from class struggle and freed from political> pressure groups. The reforms that would lead to industrial peace and social> order, these experts were coming to believe, could only be derived from data> determined by objective fact-finders (such as themselves) and under the> auspices of sober and respectable organizations (such as only they could> construct). The capitalist system could be improved only by a single-minded> reliance upon experts detached from the hurly-burly of democratic> policy-making. The emphasis was upon efficiency—and democratic policymaking> was inefficient. An approach to the making of national economic and social> policy outside traditional democratic political processes was thus emerging> before the United States formally entered World War I.[86]> [part0020.html#fn86]Several corporatist businessmen and intellectuals moved at about the same timetoward founding such statistical research institutes. In 1906–07, Jerome D.Greene, secretary of the Harvard University Corporation, helped found an eliteTuesday Evening Club at Harvard to explore important issues in economics and thesocial sciences. In 1910 Greene rose to an even more powerful post as generalmanager of the new Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and three yearslater Greene became secretary and CEO of the powerful philanthropicorganization, the Rockefeller Foundation. Greene immediately began to movetoward establishing a Rockefeller-funded institute for economic research, and inMarch 1914 he called an exploratory group together in New York, chaired by hisfriend and mentor in economics, the first Dean of the Harvard Graduate School ofBusiness, Edwin F. Gay. The developing idea was that Gay would become head of anew “scientific” and “impartial” organization, The Institute of EconomicResearch, which would gather statistical facts, and that Wesley Mitchell wouldbe its director.[87] [part0020.html#fn87]Opposing advisers to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., won out over Greene, however, andthe institute plan was scuttled.[88] [part0020.html#fn88] Mitchell and Gaypressed on, with the lead now taken by Mitchell’s longtime friend, chiefstatistician and vice president of AT&T, Malcolm C. Rorty. Rorty lined upsupport for the idea from a number of progressive statisticians and businessmen,including Chicago publisher of business books and magazines, Arch W. Shaw, E.H.Goodwin of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Magnus Alexander, statistician andassistant to the president of General Electric, like AT&T, a Morgan-orientedconcern, John R. Commons, economist and aide-de-camp to Richard T. Ely atWisconsin, and Nahum I. Stone, statistician, former Marxist, a leader in the“scientific management” movement, and labor manager for the Hickey Freemanclothing company. This group was in the process of forming a “Committee onNational Income” when the United States entered the war, and they were forced toshelve their plans temporarily.[89] [part0020.html#fn89] After the war, however,the group set up the National Bureau of Economic Research, in 1920.[90][part0020.html#fn90]While the National Bureau was not to take final shape until after the war,another organization, created on similar lines, successfully won Greene andRockefeller’s support. In 1916 they were persuaded by Raymond B. Fosdick tofound the Institute for Government Research (IGR).[91] [part0020.html#fn91] TheIGR was slightly different in focus from the National Bureau group, as it grewdirectly out of municipal progressive reform and the political scienceprofession. One of the important devices used by the municipal reformers was theprivate bureau of municipal research, which tried to seize decision-making fromallegedly “corrupt” democratic bodies on behalf of efficient, nonpartisanorganizations headed by progressive technocrats and social scientists. In 1910President William Howard Taft, intrigued with the potential for centralizingpower in a chief executive inherent in the idea of the executive budget,appointed the “father of the budget idea,” the political scientist Frederick D.Cleveland, as head of a Commission on Economy and Efficiency. Cleveland was thedirector of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research. The Cleveland Commissionalso included political scientist and municipal reformer Frank Goodnow,professor of public law at Columbia University, first president of the AmericanPolitical Science Association and president of Johns Hopkins, and WilliamFranklin Willoughby, former student of Ely, Assistant Director of the Bureau ofCensus, and later president of the American Association for LaborLegislation.[92] [part0020.html#fn92] The Cleveland Commission was delighted totell President Taft precisely what he wanted to hear. The Commission recommendedsweeping administrative changes that would provide a Bureau of CentralAdministrative Control to form a “consolidated information and statistical armof the entire national government.” And at the heart of the new Bureau would bethe Budget Division, which was to develop, at the behest of the president, andthen present “an annual program of business for the Federal Government to befinanced by Congress.”[93] [part0020.html#fn93]When Congress balked at the Cleveland Commission’s recommendations, thedisgruntled technocrats decided to establish an Institute for GovernmentResearch in Washington to battle for these and similar reforms. With fundingsecured from the Rockefeller Foundation, the IGR was chaired by Goodnow, withWilloughby as its director.[94] [part0020.html#fn94] Soon Robert S. Brookingsassumed responsibility for the financing.When America entered the war, present and future NBER and IGR leaders were allover Washington, key figures and statisticians in the collectivized war economy.By far the most powerful of the growing number of economists and statisticiansinvolved in World War I was Edwin F. Gay. Arch W. Shaw, an enthusiast for rigidwartime planning of economic resources, was made head of the new CommercialEconomy Board by the Council of National Defense as soon as America entered thewar.[95] [part0020.html#fn95] Shaw, who had taught at and served on theadministrative board of Harvard Business School, staffed the board with HarvardBusiness people; the secretary was Harvard economist Melvin T. Copeland, andother members included Dean Gay. The board, which later became the powerfulConservation Division of the War Industries Board, focused on restrictingcompetition in industry by eliminating the number and variety of products and byimposing compulsory uniformity, all in the name of “conservation” of resourcesto aid the war effort. For example, garment firms had complained loudly ofsevere competition because of the number and variety of styles, and so Gay urgedthe garment firms to form a trade association to work with the government incurbing the surfeit of competition. Gay also tried to organize the bakers sothat they would not follow the usual custom of taking back stale and unsoldbread from retail outlets. By the end of 1917, Gay was tired of using voluntarypersuasion and was urging the government to use compulsory measures.Gay’s major power came in early 1918 when the Shipping Board, which hadofficially nationalized all ocean shipping, determined to restrict drasticallythe use of ships for civilian trade and to use the bulk of shipping fortransport of American troops to France. Appointed in early January 1918 asmerely a “special expert” by the Shipping Board, Gay in a brief time became thekey figure in redirecting shipping from civilian to military use. Soon Edwin Gayhad become a member of the War Trade Board and head of its statisticaldepartment, which issued restrictive licenses for permitted imports, head of thestatistical department of the Shipping Board, representative of the ShippingBoard on the War Trade Board, head of the statistical committee of theDepartment of Labor, head of the Division of Planning and Statistics of the WarIndustries Board (WIB), and, above all, head of the new Central Bureau ofPlanning and Statistics. The Central Bureau was organized in the fall of 1918,when President Wilson asked WIB chairman Bernard Baruch to produce a monthlysurvey of all the government’s war activities. This “conspectus” evolved intothe Central Bureau, responsible directly to the president. The importance of thebureau is noted by a recent historian:> The new Bureau represented the “peak” statistical division of the> mobilization, becoming its “seer and prophet” for the duration, coordinating> over a thousand employees engaged in research and, as the agency responsible> for giving the president a concise picture of the entire economy, becoming the> closest approximation to a “central statistical commission.” During the latter> stages of the war it set up a clearinghouse of statistical work, organized> liaisons with the statistical staff of all the war boards, and centralized the> data production process for the entire war bureaucracy. By the war’s end,> Wesley Mitchell recalled, “we were in a fair way to develop for the first time> a systematic organization of federal statistics.”[96] [part0020.html#fn96]Within a year, Edwin Gay had risen from a special expert to the unquestionedczar of a giant network of federal statistical agencies, with over a thousandresearchers and statisticians working under his direct control. It is no wonderthen that Gay, instead of being enthusiastic about the American victory he hadworked so hard to secure, saw the Armistice as “almost ... a personal blow” thatplunged him “into the slough of despond.” All of his empire of statistics andcontrol had just been coming together and developing into a mighty machine whensuddenly “came that wretched Armistice.”[97] [part0020.html#fn97] Truly atragedy of peace.Gay tried valiantly to keep the war machinery going, continually complainingbecause many of his aides were leaving and bitterly denouncing the “hungry pack”who, for some odd reason, were clamoring for an immediate end to all wartimecontrols, including those closest to his heart, foreign trade and shipping. Butone by one, despite the best efforts of Baruch and many of the wartime planners,the WIB and other war agencies disappeared.[98] [part0020.html#fn98] For awhile, Gay pinned his hopes on his Central Bureau of Planning and Statistics(CBPS), which, in a fierce bout of bureaucratic infighting, he attempted to makethe key economic and statistical group advising the American negotiators at theVersailles peace conference, thereby displacing the team of historians andsocial scientists assembled by Colonel House in the Inquiry. Despite an officialvictory, and an eight-volume report of the CBPS delivered to Versailles by thehead of CBPS European team, John Foster Dulles of the War Trade Board, thebureau had little influence over the final treaty.[99] [part0020.html#fn99]Peace having finally and irrevocably arrived, Edwin Gay, backed by Mitchell,tried his best to have the CBPS kept as a permanent, peacetime organization. Gayargued that the agency, with himself of course remaining as its head, couldprovide continuing data to the League of Nations, and above all could serve asthe president’s own eyes and ears and mold the sort of executive budgetenvisioned by the old Taft Commission. CBPS staff member and Harvard economistEdmund E. Day contributed a memorandum outlining specific tasks for the bureauto aid in demobilization and reconstruction, as well as rationale for the bureaubecoming a permanent part of government. One thing it could do was to make a“continuing canvass” of business conditions in the United States. As Gay put itto President Wilson, using a favorite organicist analogy, a permanent boardwould serve “as a nervous system to the vast and complex organization of thegovernment, furnishing to the controlling brain [the president] the informationnecessary for directing the efficient operation of the various members.”[100][part0020.html#fn100] Although the President was “very cordial” to Gay’s plan,Congress refused to agree, and on June 30, 1919, the Central Bureau of Planningand Statistics was finally terminated, along with the War Trade Board. Edwin Gaywould now have to seek employment in, if not the private, at least thequasi-independent, sector.But Gay and Mitchell were not to be denied. Nor would the Brookings-Willoughbygroup. Their objective would be met more gradually and by slightly differentmeans. Gay became editor of the New York Evening Post under the aegis of its newowner and Gay’s friend, J.P. Morgan partner Thomas W. Lamont. Gay also helped toform and become first president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in1920, with Wesley C. Mitchell as research director. The Institute for GovernmentResearch achieved its major objective, establishing a Budget Bureau in theTreasury Department in 1921, with the director of the IGR, William F.Willoughby, helping to draft the bill that established the bureau.[101][part0020.html#fn101] The IGR people soon expanded their role to includeeconomics, establishing an Institute of Economics headed by Robert Brookings andArthur T. Hadley of Yale, with economist Harold G. Moulton as director.[102][part0020.html#fn102] The institute, funded by the Carnegie Corporation, wouldbe later merged, along with the IGR, into the Brookings Institution. Edwin Gayalso moved into the foreign policy field by becoming secretary-treasurer andhead of the Research Committee of the new and extremely influentialorganization, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).[103] [part0020.html#fn103]And finally, in the field of government statistics, Gay and Mitchell found amore gradual but longer-range route to power via collaboration with HerbertHoover, soon to be Secretary of Commerce. No sooner had Hoover assumed the postin early 1921 when he expanded the Advisory Committee on the Census to includeGay, Mitchell, and other economists and then launched the monthly Survey ofCurrent Business. The Survey was designed to supplement the informationalactivities of cooperating trade associations and, by supplying businessinformation, aid these associations in Hoover’s aim of cartelizing theirrespective industries. Secrecy in business operations is a crucial weapon ofcompetition, and conversely, publicity and sharing of information is animportant tool of cartels in policing their members. The Survey of CurrentBusiness made available the current production, sales, and inventory datasupplied by cooperating industries and technical journals. Hoover also hopedthat by building on these services, eventually “the statistical program couldprovide the knowledge and foresight necessary to combat panic or speculativeconditions, prevent the development of diseased industries, and guidedecision-making so as to iron out rather than accentuate the businesscycle.”[104] [part0020.html#fn104] In promoting his cartelization doctrine,Hoover met resistance both from some businessmen who resisted pryingquestionnaires and sharing competitive secrets and from the Justice Department.But, a formidable empire-builder, Herbert Hoover managed to grab statisticalservices from the Treasury Department and to establish a “waste eliminationdivision” to organize businesses and trade associations to continue and expandthe wartime “conservation” program of compulsory uniformity and restriction ofthe number and variety of competitive products. As assistant secretary to headup this program, Hoover secured engineer and publicist Frederick Feiker, anassociate of Arch Shaw’s business publication empire. Hoover also found a topassistant and lifelong disciple in Brigadier General Julius Klein, a protégé ofEdwin Gay’s, who had headed the Latin American division of the Bureau of Foreignand Domestic Commerce. As the new head of the bureau, Klein organized 17 newexport commodity divisions—reminiscent of commodity sections during wartimecollectivism—each with “experts” drawn from the respective industries and eachorganizing regular cooperation with parallel industrial advisory committees. Andthrough it all Herbert Hoover made a series of well-publicized speeches during1921, spelling out how a well-designed government trade program, as well as aprogram in the domestic economy, could act both as a stimulant to recovery andas a permanent “stabilizer,” while avoiding such unfortunate measures asabolishing tariffs or cutting wage rates. The best weapon, both in foreign anddomestic trade, was to “eliminate waste” by a “cooperative mobilization” ofgovernment and industry.[105] [part0020.html#fn105]A month after the Armistice, the American Economic Association and the AmericanStatistical Association met jointly in Richmond, Virginia. The presidentialaddresses were delivered by men in the forefront of the exciting new world ofgovernment planning, aided by social science, that seemed to loom ahead. In hisaddress to the American Statistical Association, Wesley Clair Mitchellproclaimed that the war had “led to the use of statistics, not only as a recordof what had happened, but also as a vital factor in planning what should bedone.” As he had said in his final lecture in Columbia University the previousspring, the war had shown that when the community desires to attain a great goal“then within a short period far-reaching social changes can be achieved.” “Theneed for scientific planning of social change,” he added, “has never beengreater, the chance of making those changes in an intelligent fashion ... hasnever been so good.” The peace will bring new problems, he opined, but “it seemsimpossible” that the various countries will “attempt to solve them withoututilizing the same sort of centralized directing now employed to kill theirenemies abroad for the new purpose of reconstructing their own life at home ...”But the careful empiricist and statistician also provided a caveat. Broad socialplanning requires “a precise comprehension of social processes” and that can beprovided only by the patient research of social science. As he had written tohis wife eight years earlier, Mitchell stressed that what is needed forgovernment intervention and planning is the application of the methods ofphysical science and industry, particularly precise quantitative research andmeasurement. In contrast to the quantitative physical sciences, Mitchell toldthe assembled statisticians, the social sciences are “immature, speculative,filled with controversy” and class struggle. But quantitative knowledge couldreplace such struggle and conflict by commonly accepted precise knowledge,“objective” knowledge “amenable to mathematical formulation” and “capable offorecasting group phenomena.” A statistician, Mitchell opined, is “either rightor wrong,” and it is easy to demonstrate which. As a result of precise knowledgeof facts, Mitchell envisioned, we can achieve “intelligent experimenting anddetailed planning rather than ... agitation and class struggle.”To achieve these vital goals, none other than economists and statisticians wouldprovide the crucial element, for we would have to be “relying more and more ontrained people to plan changes for us, to follow them up, to suggestalterations.”[106] [part0020.html#fn106]In a similar vein, the assembled economists in 1918 were regaled with thevisionary presidential address of Yale economist Irving Fisher. Fisher lookedforward to an economic “world reconstruction” that would provide gloriousopportunities for economists to satisfy their constructive impulses. A classstruggle, Fisher noted, would surely be continuing over distribution of thenation’s wealth. But by devising a mechanism of “readjustment,” the nation’seconomists could occupy an enviable role as the independent and impartialarbiters of the class struggle, these disinterested social scientists making thecrucial decisions for the public good.In short, both Mitchell and Fisher were, subtly and perhaps half-consciously,advancing the case for a postwar world in which their own allegedly impartialand scientific professions could levitate above the narrow struggles of classesfor the social product, and thus emerge as a commonly accepted, “objective” newruling class, a 20th-century version of the philosopher-kings.It might not be amiss to see how these social scientists, prominent in their ownfields and spokesmen in different ways for the New Era of the 1920s, fared intheir disquisitions and guidance for the society and the economy. Irving Fisher,as we have seen, wrote several works celebrating the alleged success ofprohibition and insisted, even after 1929, that since the price level had beenkept stable, there could be no depression or stock market crash. For his part,Mitchell culminated a decade of snug alliance with Herbert Hoover by directing,along with Gay and the National Bureau, a massive and hastily written work onthe American economy. Published in 1929 on the accession of Hoover to thepresidency, with all the resources of scientific and quantitative economics andstatistics brought to bear, there is not so much as a hint in Recent EconomicChanges in the United States that there might be a crash and depression in theoffing.The Recent Economic Changes study was originated and organized by HerbertHoover, and it was Hoover who secured the financing from the CarnegieCorporation. The object was to celebrate the years of prosperity presumablyproduced by Secretary of Commerce Hoover’s corporatist planning and to find outhow the possibly future President Hoover could maintain that prosperity byabsorbing its lessons and making them a permanent part of the American politicalstructure. The volume duly declared that to maintain the current prosperity,economists, statisticians, engineers, and enlightened managers would have towork out “a technique of balance” to be installed in the economy.Recent Economic Changes, that monument to “scientific” and political folly, wentthrough three quick printings and was widely publicized and warmly received onall sides.[107] [part0020.html#fn107] Edward Eyre Hunt, Hoover’s long-time aidein organizing his planning activities, was so enthusiastic that he continuedcelebrating the book and its paean to American prosperity throughout 1929 and1930.[108] [part0020.html#fn108]It is appropriate to end our section on government and statistics by noting anunsophisticated yet perceptive cry from the heart. In 1945 the Bureau of LaborStatistics approached Congress for yet another in a long line of increases inappropriations for government statistics. In the process of questioning Dr. A.Ford Hinrichs, head of the BLS, Representative Frank B. Keefe, a conservativeRepublican Congressman from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, put an eternal question that hasnot yet been fully and satisfactorily answered:> There is no doubt but what it would be nice to have a whole lot of> statistics. ... I am just wondering whether we are not embarking on a program> that is dangerous when we keep adding and adding and adding to this thing ...> > We have been planning and getting statistics ever since 1932 to try to meet a> situation that was domestic in character, but were never able to even meet> that question. ... Now we are involved in an international question. ... It> looks to me as though we spend a tremendous amount of time with graphs and> charts and statistics and planning. What my people are interested in is what> is it all about? Where are we going, and where are you going?[109]> [part0020.html#fn109]APPENDIXTOWARD THE CENTRALIZATION OF SCIENCE: THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL[110][part0020.html#fn110]Scientific research before World War I was free, diffuse, individualistic, andindependent, with very little guidance or control exerted by the federalgovernment. Most scientists and Americans in general approved of this system,but there were always one or two visionaries yearning for an alternative. GeorgeEllery Hale, one of the founders of astrophysics, the director of Mt. WilsonObservatory and one of the founders of the California Institute of Technology,was one of those visionaries, particularly after he was named to the NationalAcademy of Sciences (NAS) in 1902. The NAS had been charted in 1863 as a privateorganization of scientists to consult with the government on scientific andmilitary matters during the Civil War. By the turn of the 20th century, the NASwas moribund, forgotten by all, including the president of the United States.But George Ellery Hale, turning from the joys of science to the rather differentjoys of bureaucratic empire and power-building, had a different vision. Hesought to make the NAS a vibrant, activist organization, and one of his mostimportant visions was that the NAS should, with the aid of government, acquire adominant, centralizing power over all scientific research in the nation. Andsitting at or near the pinnacle of scientific power, of course, would be GeorgeEllery Hale. He delivered a series of lectures and published articles at the NASto that effect in 1913–14, but the old fuddy-duddies of the Academy weren’tlistening.George Hale did not come to his vision purely on this own. As director of theMt. Wilson Observatory, he had gained a powerful friend and political mentor—oneof the most influential men of the Eastern Establishment: Wall Street lawyer,Secretary of War, Secretary of State, U.S. Senator from New York, and personalattorney for J.P. Morgan, Elihu Root. Root, the son of a professor of astronomy,informed Hale upon his election to the unknown NAS of the untapped potential ofthe agency for advising and coordinating science on behalf of the government.And it was clear that Root would do all he could to further that objective.[111][part0020.html#fn111]Then, as luck would have it, the World War began in Europe. By the spring of1916, Hale was champing at the bit to enter the war on the Allied side, averringhis deep hatred for Germans, and bitterly attacking the anti-interventioniststance of Henry Ford and William Jennings Bryan. Hale was certainly succinctabout what he would do with these dissidents. “They ought to be imprisoned astraitors,” he wrote, “or thoroughly chloroformed.”[112] [part0020.html#fn112]Hale pressured the more laggard patriots of the executive council of the NAS tooffer the services of the Academy to the federal government in case of war.After the surprised president learned of the existence of the NAS, Wilsonaccepted the offer.George Ellery Hale quickly became chairman of the new NAS committee to plan theAcademy’s services after war came. His most enthusiastic collaborator on the NASwas Robert A. Millikan, a University of Chicago physicist who had become amember in 1915. Hale exulted that war would be “the greatest chance we ever hadto advance research in America.”[113] [part0020.html#fn113] By June 1916, Haleand Millikan had decided that the NAS should create a new agency, the NationalResearch Council (NRS), which would have the operating power to coordinatescientific research when war came. Under pressure from Elihu Root, Wilsonapproved the idea of the NRC in July. The next problem was to secure funding,since the NRC would be a privately-financed agency, and since the NAS had verylittle spare money of its own. Financial support was obtained from theEngineering Foundation, which committed its entire annual income of $10,000 tothe project, in addition to a personal contribution of $5000 put in by thefounder and chairman of the Engineering Foundation, the Cleveland machine-tooland telescope manufacturer Ambrose Swasey, an old friend of Hale.Its financing secured, the National Research Council was launched in September,dedicated to: performing an inventory of all scientific researchers, projects,and equipment in the country, in preparation for war planning; to cooperate witheducational institutions and research foundations; and to function as a“clearing house” to coordinate research projects and scientific information.Moreover, the NRC was to encourage research on national defense and resourceproblems.The Board of the Engineering Foundation, launched in 1914, obtainedrepresentation of the various national engineering societies. Vice-chairman ofthe Engineering Foundation, and another old friend of the ubiquitous Hale, wasanother scientific visionary: the Serbian immigrant, physicist, inventor, andColumbia University professor, Michael Pupin. While recognizing the importanceof individualism and freedom in science, Pupin insisted that there was a farmore important requisite for the growth and success of science: “creativecoordination,” which he explicitly defined as cooperation enforced bycompulsion. Without coercion binding everything together, Pupin philosophized,all would be anarchy and chaos, including science. And, of course, as Pupincorrectly noted, the State is overwhelmingly the most important instrument ofcoercion. Therefore, there must be centralization of science under Statedictation. Pupin’s goal is what he termed, probably not ironically, “idealdemocracy,” which consisted of the “state organism” being ruled and directed bythe “trained intellects” guiding the destiny of the people. Of course,scientists were a crucial, if not the most vital, part of the trained intellectserving as brain of the social organism. Michael Pupin of course hailed the NRCas the first step toward the compulsory coordination of America’s intellectualsand their organizations.[114] [part0020.html#fn114]They were an effective team for a collectivized science: Michael Pupin thetheoretician, and George Hale the activist, assisted by Millikan. To ensure theNRC’s stellar role in the war effort, Hale lobbied successfully to make the NRCan official department of the Council of National Defense, with soleresponsibility for coordinating scientific resources for war. The NRC nowhappily set up subcommittees in each discipline: Hale’s good friend EdwinConklin as chairman of the biology subcommittee. James McKeen Cattell in chargeof the psychology subcommittee, and Pupin and Robert A. Millikan dominating thephysics subcommittee.[115] [part0020.html#fn115] Millikan, who became the majorpersonality and ideological force in American science during the 1920s, was aformer student and protégé of Michael Pupin. An assistant professor of physicsat the University of Chicago, Millikan had floundered in his researches from1896 on, until finally becoming extremely successful; by 1912, he had embarkedon his researches on electron charge that would win him the Nobel Prize.Millikan, was made a member of the organizing committee of the NRC in 1916, andwent from there to become a member of the executive committee, and then vicepresident and chief administrative officers of the NRC, as well as chairman ofthe physics committee of the Anti-Submarine Council. So dedicated was Millikanto the war effort that he left Chicago to plunge into full-time war work inWashington, with a commission as an army officer.[116] [part0020.html#fn116]Many of the nation’s leading scientists and engineers entered the armed forces.Thus, physicist Ernest Merritt, of Cornell, entered the navy in order to head upthe New London, Connecticut anti-submarine warfare naval base staffed byuniversity scientists.Well before the end of the war, the problem uppermost in the minds of thescientists was to make the NRC permanent. The organized scientists and inparticular the scientists connected with industry, from the beginning envisionedthe NRC not merely as a wartime agency, but as a permanent government forcesponsoring and coordinating the application to science in industry. Thus, GeorgeHale circulated an anonymous, strictly confidential memorandum within the NRCexecutive council in May 1919, proclaiming the original intent and the futuregoal of the agency:> The Academy organized the National Research Council ... with a view to> stimulating the growth of science and its application to industry and> particularly with a view to the coordination of research agencies for the sake> of enabling the United States, in spite of its democratic, individualistic> organization, to bend its energies effectively toward a common purpose.[117]> [part0020.html#fn117]As early as eight months before the Armistice, the organized scientists began toagitate for a quick presidential order making the NRC a permanent, peacetimeagency. Since the agency, though governmental, had to be financed by privatefunds, the first step was to demonstrate secure, durable financing. The CarnegieCorporation, headed by none other than Hale’s friend and mentor, Elihu Root,happily obliged with a $5 million grant for an NRC building and an operatingendowment. Soon, Hale’s old friends at the Engineering Foundation assumedcontinuing financial responsibility for the NRC, and at that point Elihu Rootmanaged to persuade Colonel House to secure President Wilson’s approval.[118][part0020.html#fn118] Wilson created a permanent National Research Council byexecutive order on May 11, 1918.By the time of Wilson’s imprimatur, the irrepressible George Hale was alreadycirculating a letter proclaiming a shift in emphasis from military to permanentindustrial research. To that end, he informed his colleagues of the NRC, heproceeded to create a new Industrial Relations Division. The Division wascomposed of six leaders from elite companies engaged in industrial research:Frank Jewett, director of the Western Electric labs, a wholly owned subsidiaryof A.T.&T., J.J. Carty, long-time chief engineer at A.T.&T., Arthur D. Little,the nation’s engineering consultant, Raymond Bacon, director of the MellonInstitute, Charles E. Skinner, director of research at the Mellon-orientedWestinghouse Electric, and Willis Whitney, director of research at theMorgan-aligned General Electric.On May 29, George Hale officially launched the Industrial Relations Divisionwith a gala formal banquet at the University Club of New York, a banquet whichsymbolized and embodied the new, continuing alliance of the federal governmentwith the top brass in industrial science and research. Addressing the banquet,George Hale proclaimed that “Hitherto, the National Research Council activitieshave been mostly devoted to war, but plans have been under contemplation forindustrial research and the time has arrived to put these plans forward.” Intheir banquet speeches, Hale and Elihu Root stressed the need for nationalcoordination of industrial resources.Perhaps the most exuberant of the speakers was the original financier of theNRC, the industrialist Ambrose Swasey. Americans and other nations might at thatmoment be fighting and dying in one of the most devastating wars in history, butto Swasey the war was an exhilarating experience. “We who are living in thesewonderful times,” Swasey exclaimed, “have thrilling opportunities andcorrespondingly weighty responsibilities.” Enumerating the great advancesoccasioned by the war, Swasey noted that “whereas a year ago this countryproduced no optical glass, it is now manufacturing this material by thecarload.” Part of the great progress occasioned by the war, he pointed out, wasdue to the U.S. seizure of German patents. Swasey concluded with a briefdemurrer before exulting over the war’s matchless benefits: “While deeplydeploring the war,” Swasey proclaimed, “the marvelous advances it was bringingin the mental, moral and spiritual realms, with consequent great benefits tomankind ...”[119] [part0020.html#fn119]The main harvest of this banquet was the creation of an advisory committee ofindustrial leaders to the Industrial Research Division, and the publication of apamphlet on the new division co-authored by some of the most distinguishedleaders present at the banquet. Chairman of the advisory committee was theeminent Theodore N. Vail, president of A.T.&T., and other members includedCleveland H. Dodge, vice president of Phelps-Dodge mining and President Wilson’sfavorite industrialist, George Eastman, head of Eastman Kodak, Andrew Mellon,head of the mighty Mellon banking and industrial family, and soon to becomeSecretary of the Treasury, Pierre DuPont, Ambrose Swasey, Elihu Root, JudgeElbert H. Gary, head of the Morgan-influenced U.S. Steel, E. Wilbur Rice,president of General Electric, and Henry S. Pritchett, president of the CarnegieFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching.[120] [part0020.html#fn120]In the pamphlet, the various distinguished contributors beat the drums for anational coordination of science, a veritable coordinatedgovernment-science-industry complex. Thus, President Vail of A.T.&T. declaredthat> Organization and coordination of research for industrial purpose is urgently> necessary. ... Plans should be formulated at once. ... Whatever is done should> be national in its comprehensiveness. ... Industry may be expected to support> generously any organization which promises to effectively coordinate and> correlate efforts for the increase of knowledge, since it is now generally> recognized that industrial progress and success are chiefly dependent upon our> knowledge.[121] [part0020.html#fn121]In the midst of the wartime model, it is not surprising that military-like“discipline” was a common theme of these industrial, scientific and politicalleaders. Thus, Elihu Root in his article, “The Need for Organization inScientific Research,” opined that “scientific men are only recentlyrealizing ... that the effective power of a great number of scientific men maybe increased by organization just as the effective power of a great number oflaborers may be increased by military discipline.” In the war, Root added, thepower of science has “amazingly increased the productive power of mankind.”After the war, that same power “will be applied again and the prizes ofindustrial and commercial leadership will fall to the nation which organizes itsscientific forces most effectively.”And Henry S. Pritchett, of the Carnegie Foundation, who had long admired theGerman model of a national physical laboratory and national coordination ofscience, called for post-war America to establish a similar system. Pritchettinsisted that “The research men of a nation are not isolated individuals but anorganized and cooperating army.”[122] [part0020.html#fn122]In early 1919, the NRC was formally structured for the post-war world into anumber of divisions. One of the most active in serving and subsidizing industrywas the Industrial Relations Division (later renamed the Industrial ResearchDivision, and finally the Industrial Extension Division), which establishedcooperative research programs in various industries and initiated researchprojects in various areas of metals and electroplating. In particular, theIndustrial Relations Division created a number of industrial research institutesin collaboration with various trade associations.[123] [part0020.html#fn123]Another very active division of the NRC was the Engineering Division, launchedduring the war in 1918. The Engineering Division was founded under the auspicesof the Engineering Foundation which by now had become the research branch of theAmerican Engineering Council, the umbrella organization of all the variousengineering associations. Engineering Foundation head Ambrose Swasey also becamea member of the new Engineering Division of the NRC. The function of thedivision was to encourage direct industrial research, the funds often to besupplied by the industry concerned, but the organizing and coordination to beperformed by the NRC. The first project of the Engineering Division was alarge-scale study of metal fatigue, financed by the Engineering Foundation andby General Electric. On the other hand, a project to study the heat treatment ofcarbon steel was financed by the federal government, and federal and stategovernments supported a program of highway research conducted by thedivision.[124] [part0020.html#fn124]Another important post-war arm of the NRC, the Research Information Service,also began during the war as the Research Information Committee, under physicistand Bureau of Standards head Samuel Stratton, to disseminate scientificinformation between the U.S. and its European allies. After the war, the RISprepared scientific compilations, source books, abstracts, handbooks, andbibliographies and disseminated them, in George Hale’s words, to those who “canuse it to advantage.” In the words of Charles L. Reese, research and chemicaldirector of Du Pont, the service operated as an “intelligence agency.”[125][part0020.html#fn125]The major dispute among the NRC-affiliated and connected scientists was whetheror not scientific research in the postwar world should be thoroughly centralizedunder one governmental research institute and national laboratory, in physicsand chemistry. George Vincent, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and hiscolleague Edward C. Pickering, head of the Harvard Observatory, had beenagitating for the idea of a centralized research institute since 1913, trying topersuade the membership of the American Association for the Advancement ofScience. During the war, Vincent, backed by Dr. Simon Flexner, head of theRockefeller Institute for Medical Research, wrote a letter to the NRC executiveproposing the plan for the postwar world. Hale, Pritchett, and Root were highlyenthusiastic, but the more cautious Millikan and Whitney advocated three to sixregional laboratories at existing university facilities. None of the contendingparties, of course, had any desire to return to the good old days ofdecentralized, free and private scientific research. Finally, all parties agreedon a compromise plan, which provided for no national or regional laboratories,but did set up a massive fellowship program in graduate physics and chemistry,administered by the government NRC and financed entirely by the RockefellerFoundation. The science centralizers might not have achieved all of their aims,but they were well on the road.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in the Journal of Libertarian Studies 9, no. 1 (1989):81–125.[1] [part0020.html#ft1] The title of this paper is borrowed from the pioneeringlast chapter of Weinstein’s excellent work, The Corporate Ideal in the LiberalState, 1900–1918.

Morgan & Co. Social Gospel leaders Lyman Abbott, the Rev. R.Heber Newton and the Rev. Washington Gladden, were leading Progressive Partydelegates. The Progressive Party proclaimed itself as the “recrudescence of thereligious spirit in American political life.” Theodore Roosevelt’s acceptancespeech was significantly entitled “A Confession of Faith,” and his words werepunctuated by “amens” and by a continual singing of pietist Christian hymns bythe assembled delegates. They sang “Onward Christian Soldiers,” “The Battle Hymnof the Republic,” and especially the revivalist hymn, “Follow, Follow, We WillFollow Jesus,” with the word “Roosevelt” replacing “Jesus” at every turn. Thehorrified New York Times summed up the unusual experience by calling theProgressive grouping “a convention of fanatics.” And it added, “It was not aconvention at all. It was an assemblage of religious enthusiasts. It was such aconvention as Peter the Hermit held. It was a Methodist camp following done overinto political terms.” Cited in Gable, The Bull Moose Years, p. 75.[14] [part0020.html#ft14] Timberlake, Prohibition and the Progressive Movement,p. 24.[15] [part0020.html#ft15] Quoted in Timberlake, Prohibition and the ProgressiveMovement, p. 27.

Margaret Dreier Robins and her husbandRaymond were virtually a paradigmatic progressive couple. Raymond was aFlorida-born wanderer and successful gold prospector who underwent a mysticalconversion experience in the Alaska wilds and became a pietist preacher. Hemoved to Chicago, where he became a leader in Chicago settlement house work andmunicipal reform. Margaret Dreier and her sister Mary were daughters of awealthy and socially prominent New York family who worked for and financed theemergent National Women’s Trade Union League. Margaret married Raymond Robins in1905 and moved to Chicago, soon becoming longtime president of the league. InChicago, the Robinses led and organized progressive political causes for overtwo decades, becoming top leaders of the Progressive Party from 1912 to 1916.During the war, Raymond Robins engaged in considerable diplomatic activity ashead of a Red Cross mission to Russia.

Interestingly, The National War Labor Board (NWLB) frankly adopted theconcept of “equal pay for equal work” in order to limit the employment of womenworkers by imposing higher costs on the employer. The “only check,” affirmed theNWLB, on excessive employment of women “is to make it no more profitable toemploy women than men.” Quoted in Valerie I.

Morrow, inspired by the agitation against venerealdisease and in favor of the continence urged by the French syphilographer,Jean-Alfred Fournier, formed in 1905 the American Society for Sanitary and MoralProphylaxis (ASSMP). Soon, the terms proposed by the Chicago branch of ASSMP,“social hygiene” and “sex hygiene,” became widely used for their medical andscientific patina, and in 1910 ASSMP changed its name to the American Federationfor Sex Hygiene (AFSH). Finally, in late 1913, AFSH, an organization ofphysicians, combined with the National Vigilance Association (formerly theAmerican Purity Alliance), a group of clergymen and social workers, to form theall-embracing American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA).In this social hygiene movement, the moral and medical went hand in hand. ThusDr. Morrow welcomed the new knowledge about venereal disease because itdemonstrated that “punishment for sexual sin” no longer had to be “reserved forthe hereafter.”The first president of ASHA was the president of Harvard University, Charles W.Eliot. In his address to the first meeting, Eliot made clear that totalabstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and even spices was part and parcel of theanti-prostitution and purity crusade.On physicians, the purity crusade, and the formation of ASHA, see Ronald Hamowy,“Medicine and the Crimination of Sin: ‘Self-Abuse’ in 19th Century America,”Journal of Libertarian Studies 1 (Summer 1972): 247–59; James Wunsch,“Prostitution and Public Policy: From Regulation to Suppression, 1858–1920”(Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1976); and Roland R.

Whileprostitution was indeed banned in Storyville after 1917, Storyville, contrary tolegend, never “closed”—the saloons and dance halls remained open, and contraryto orthodox accounts, jazz was never really shut down in Storyville or NewOrleans, and it was therefore never forced up river.

A minority of pro-war socialists broke off from theantiwar Socialist Party to form the Social Democratic League, and to join apro-war front organized and financed by the Wilson administration, the AmericanAlliance for Labor and Democracy. The pro-war socialists welcomed the war asproviding “startling progress in collectivism,” and opined that after the war,the existent state socialism would be advanced toward “democratic collectivism.”The pro-war socialists included John Spargo, Algie Simons, W.J. Ghent, Robert R.LaMonte, Charles Edward Russell, J.G. Phelps Stokes, Upton Sinclair, and WilliamEnglish Walling.

Kallen, a discipleof John Dewey and an exponent of progressive pragmatism. Kallen praisedMussolini for his pragmatic approach, and in particular for the élan vital thatMussolini had infused into Italian life. True, Professor Kallen conceded,fascism is coercive, but surely this is only a temporary expedient. Notingfascism’s excellent achievement in economics, education, and administrativereform, Kallen added that “in this respect the Fascist revolution is not unlikethe Communist revolution. Each is the application by force ... of an ideology toa condition. Each should have the freest opportunity once it has made astart. ...” The accompanying New Republic editorial endorsed Kallen’s thesis andadded that “alien critics should beware of outlawing a political experimentwhich aroused in a whole nation an increased moral energy and dignified itsactivities by subordinating them to a deeply felt common purpose.” New Republic49 (January 12, 1927): 207–13.

With that kind of mindset, the creation ofthe Federal Reserve System in December 1913 can be attributed to a simple,enlightened acceptance of the need to bring the economy of the United Statesinto the modern world. It is generally held, in addition, that a central bank isnecessary to curb the natural instincts of free-market banks to inflate and, asa corollary, to level out economic fluctuations. It has become all too clear inrecent years, however, that the Fed has scarcely succeeded in this supposedtask. For since the establishment of the Fed, we have suffered the longest anddeepest depression in American history, and we have, since World War II,experienced the unique phenomenon of a chronic, accelerating secular inflation.Since instability, inflation, and depressions have been far worse since theinception of the Federal Reserve, many economists have concluded that the Fedhas failed in its task and have come up with various suggestions for reform totry to get it on the correct task.It is possible, however, that the current critics of the Fed have missed theessential point: that the Fed was designed to meet very different goals. Infact, the Fed was largely fashioned by the banks as a cartelizing device. Thegovernment interventions of the Progressive era were systemic devices torestrict competition and cartelize industry, stratagems that followed on theprevious failure of industry to sustain successful voluntary cartels. Just asother industries turned to the government to impose cartelization that could notbe maintained on the market, so the banks turned to government to enable them toexpand money and credit without being held back by the demands for redemption bycompeting banks. In short, rather than hold back the banks from their propensityto inflate credit, the new central banks were created to do precisely theopposite. Indeed, the record of the American economy under the Federal Reservecan be considered a rousing success from the point of view of the actual goalsof its founders and of those who continue to sustain its power.A proper overall judgment on the actual role of the Fed was delivered by thevice-chairman and de facto head of the Federal Trade Commission, Edward N.Hurley. The Federal Trade Commission was Woodrow Wilson’s other majorProgressive reform, following closely on the passage of the Federal Reserve Act.Hurley was president of the Illinois Manufacturers Association at the time ofhis appointment, and his selection and subsequent performance in his new jobwere hailed throughout the business community. Addressing the Association ofNational Advertisers in December 1913, Hurley exulted that “through a period ofyears the government has been gradually extending its machinery of helpfulnessto different classes and groups upon whose prosperity depends in a large degreethe prosperity of the country.” Then came the revealing statement: The railroadsand shippers had the ICC, the farmers had the Agriculture Department, and thebankers had the Federal Reserve Board. Hurley concluded that “to do for generalbusiness that which these other agencies do for the groups to which I havereferred was the thought behind the creation of the trade commission.”[1][part0021.html#fn1] What, then, did the Federal Reserve do for the nation’sbankers?1. THE ORIGINS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE: THE DISSATISFACTION OF NEW YORK BANKERSThe Federal Reserve did not replace a system of free banking. On the contrary,an approach to free banking existed in the United States only in the two decadesbefore the Civil War. Under the cover of the wartime emergency, the RepublicanParty put through changes that had long been proposed by the Republicans’ancestor, the Whig Party. The National Bank Acts of 1863–65 replaced thehard-money free banking of pre-Civil War days with the quasi-centralized regimeof the national banking system. By levying a prohibitive federal tax, thenational banking system in effect outlawed state bank notes, centralizing theissue of bank notes into the hands of federally chartered national banks. Bymeans of an elaborate set of categories and a structure of fractional reserverequirements, entry into national banking in the big cities was limited to largebanks, and bank deposits were encouraged to pyramid on top of a handful of largeWall Street banks. Furthermore, an expansion of any one bank in the pre-CivilWar era was severely limited, since the free market would discount the notes ofshaky banks, roughly proportionate to the distance of the circulating notes fromthe home base of the bank.[2] [part0021.html#fn2] The national banking actsremoved that restraint by forcing every national bank to accept the notes anddemand deposits of every other national bank at par. Genuine redeemability ofnotes and deposits was also restrained by the continued legal prohibition ofinterstate or even intrastate branch banking, which severely hobbled theefficiency of clearing systems where one bank presents the obligations ofanother for redemption. Redemption was also curtailed by a rigid statutorymaximum limit of $3 million per month by which national bank notes could becontracted. Furthermore, although private national bank liabilities were ofcourse not legal tender, the federal government conferred quasi-legal tenderstatus upon them by agreeing to receive all national bank notes and deposits atpar in dues or taxes.The banking system of the United States after 1865 was, therefore, a halfwayhouse between free and central banking. Banking was subsidized, privileged, andquasi-centralized under the aegis of a handful of large Wall Street banks. Evenat that, however, the large national banks and their financial colleagues werefar from satisfied. There was no governmental central bank to act as the lenderof last resort. The banks could inflate more readily and uniformly than beforethe Civil War, but when they got into trouble and bank-generated booms turnedinto recessions, they were forced to contract and deflate to save themselves. Aswe will see further below, the bankers’ drive for fundamental change wasgenerally couched in terms of an attack on the “inelasticity” of the nationalbanking system. Translated into plain English, “inelasticity” meant theinability of the banking system to inflate money and credit, especially duringrecessions.[3] [part0021.html#fn3]The big banks’ turn to the idea of a central bank came after the beginning ofthe 20th century. The increased dissatisfaction with the status quo was promptedparticularly by the rising competition of state banks and private banks outsidethe direct purview of the national banks of Wall Street. State banks hadrecovered from their initial shock and, after the 1860s, grew rapidly bypyramiding loans and deposits on top of national bank notes. These state andother non-national banks provided increasingly stiff competition with WallStreet for the banking resources of the nation. State banks were free of thehigh legal capital requirements for entry into the national banking business,and banking laws, especially in such important states as Michigan, California,and New York, became more lenient during the 1890s. As a result, the proportionof non-national bank deposits to national bank notes and deposits, which hadbeen 67% in 1873, rose to 101% in 1886 and to 145% in 1901. To make things worsefor cartelization, New York City lost its monopoly of designated “centralreserve city” status—the base of the nation’s banking pyramid—to St. Louis andChicago in 1887. As a result, the total bank deposits of St. Louis and Chicago,which had been only 16% of the combined total of the three major cities in 1880,rose sharply to 33% by 1912. Banking in the smaller reserve cities rose evenmore rapidly in this period: the bank clearings outside of New York, 24% of thenational total in 1882, rose to 43% by 1913.[4] [part0021.html#fn4] The majorNew York banks were understandably perturbed at the rising competition ofnon-New York and non-national banks. They were upset, too, by the fact that theyhad to compete with each other for the deposits of the burgeoning state banks.As one New York banker put it: “We love the country bankers, but they are themasters of the situation. We dance at their music and pay the piper.”[5][part0021.html#fn5]The New York national bankers were also particularly perturbed at themushrooming growth of private trust companies in New York, which were gatheringthe major share of the new and profitable trust business, when national and moststate-chartered banks were prohibited by law from handling trust accounts. Atthe behest of the national banks, the New York Clearing House, a privateorganization for the clearing of notes and deposits, tried to impose reserverequirements on trust companies to hobble their competition with banks. Inreply, 17 of them walked out of the Clearing House for a decade. Finally, theHouse of Morgan formed the banker-owned Bankers’ Trust Company in 1903 tocompete with the private trust companies.[6] [part0021.html#fn6]J.P. Morgan & Co. was the most powerful financial grouping in Wall Street andhence in the country. An investment bank that came to own or control the bulk ofthe nation’s important railroads, the House of Morgan controlled such leadingWall Street national banks as Guaranty Trust Company, the First National Bank ofNew York, and, before the 1930s, the Chase National Bank. Despite (or perhapsbecause of) its mammoth size and influence, Morgan was doing poorly in the galesof competition after 1900. In addition to the factors mentioned above thatweakened New York banks, railroads, in which the Morgans had concentrated theirforces, began to enter their long secular decline after the turn of the century.Furthermore, virtually all the mergers in the 1898–1902 period that tried toachieve monopoly control and monopoly profits in various industries collapsedwith the entry of new firms and suffered major losses. Some of the mostegregious failures—including International Harvester, United States Steel, andInternational Mercantile Marine—were Morgan creations.J.P. Morgan had long favored corporatism and government cartelization wherecompetition proved inconvenient. After decades of abject failure ofMorgan-created railroad cartels, Morgan took the lead in establishing theInterstate Commerce Commission in 1887 to cartelize the railroad industry. Now,after slipping badly in the free market after 1900, Morgan joined other bigbusiness interests, such as the Rockefellers and the Belmonts, in calling forthe compulsory cartelization of the American economy. This alliance of powerfulbig business interests, professionals who sought power and place constitutedwhat is now known as the Progressive Era (approximately 1900 to 1918). TheFederal Reserve Act was a “progressive” Wilsonian reform that, as Edward Hurleyand others pointed out, “did for” the bankers what the other reforms had donefor other segments of industry.[7] [part0021.html#fn7]2. THE ROAD TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE[8] [part0021.html#fn8]During the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations, treasury secretaries Lyman J.Gage and Leslie M. Shaw respectively tried to operate the Treasury Department asa central bank, pumping in money during recessions by purchasing governmentbonds on the open market and depositing large funds with commercial banks. In1900, Gage called for the establishment of regional central banks, and Shawsuggested in his last annual report in 1906 that he be given total power toregulate the nation’s banks. Their efforts failed, and these failures helped tospur the big bankers to seek a formal central bank.[9] [part0021.html#fn9]Neither Gage nor Shaw was an isolated treasury bureaucrat whose power wassuddenly going to his head. Before his appointment, Gage was president of thepowerful First National Bank of Chicago, one of the major banks in theRockefeller orbit. He also served as president of the American BankersAssociation. After leaving the Treasury Department, Gage became president of theRockefeller-controlled U.S. Trust Company, and his hand-picked assistant at thedepartment, Frank A. Vanderlip, left to become a top executive at theRockefellers’ flagship bank, the National City Bank of New York.[10][part0021.html#fn10] Gage’s appointment as treasury secretary was secured forhim by Mark Hanna, close friend, political mastermind, and financial backer ofPresident McKinley. Hanna, a coal magnate and iron manufacturer, was a closebusiness associate as well as an old friend and high school classmate of John D.Rockefeller, Sr.[11] [part0021.html#fn11]Leslie Shaw was a small-town Iowa banker who became governor of his state in1898 and continued as president of the Bank of Denison until the end of histerm. He reached his post as governor by being a loyal supporter of the DesMoines Regency, the Republican machine in Iowa, and a close friend of theRegency’s leader, the powerful and venerable U.S. senator William Boyd Allison.Allison was the one who secured the treasury position for his friend Shaw and inturn was tied closely to Charles E. Perkins, a close Morgan ally, president ofthe Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and kinsman of the Forbes financialgroup of Boston, long associated with the Morgans.[12] [part0021.html#fn12]After the failure of Shaw’s interventions, and particularly after the Panic of1907, the big bankers turned in earnest to a drive for the establishment of acentral bank in the United States. The movement was launched in January 1906when Jacob H. Schiff, the head of the powerful investment banking firm of Kuhn,Loeb & Co., urged the New York Chamber of Commerce to advocate fundamentalbanking reform. Heeding the call, the New York chamber immediately established aspecial committee to study the problem and propose legislation. The committeewas comprised of leaders from commercial and investment banking, includingIsidor Straus of R.H. Macy’s (a close friend of Schiff) and Frank A. Vanderlipof the National City Bank. In March, the special committee report, notsurprisingly, called for the creation of a strong central bank “similar to theBank of Germany.”The New York chamber proved reluctant to endorse this far-reaching scheme, butthe big bankers had the bit in their teeth. In mid-1906, the American BankersAssociation followed suit by naming a commission of inquiry of leading bankersfrom the major cities of the country, headed by A. Barton Hepburn, chairman ofthe board of Chase National Bank. The Hepburn commission was more cautious, andits report of November 1906 called for imperative changes in the existingbanking system, including a system of regional clearing houses for the issue ofbank notes. The notes would be guaranteed by a common pool built up by taxeslevied on the notes.[13] [part0021.html#fn13]A variant of the Hepburn plan was passed by Congress in May 1908, after thePanic of 1907, in the Aldrich-Vreeland Act. Aldrich-Vreeland provided for theissuance of “emergency” currency by groups of bankers clustered in “NationalCurrency Associations.” Although this regional cartel scheme was devised as astopgap measure, the congressional authorization was to be for seven years, arather long “temporary” period.[14] [part0021.html#fn14]In fact, however, Aldrich-Vreeland provisions were used only once, and that wasin 1914, shortly after the launching of the Federal Reserve System. By far themost significant aspect of Aldrich-Vreeland turned out to be its clause settingup a National Monetary Commission to study the American and foreign bankingsystems and to emerge with a plan of reform. The commission consisted of ninesenators and nine representatives and, in standard bureaucratic procedure, thechairman of the commission was Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and the vice-chairmanwas Representative Edward B. Vreeland.Representative Vreeland was a banker from the Buffalo area of New York, andlittle more need be said about him. Far more important was the powerful SenatorNelson W. Aldrich, a Republican from Rhode Island who made millions during hislong years of service in the U.S. Senate. One of the prime movers in thecreation of the Federal Reserve System, Nelson Aldrich was the father-in-law ofJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., and may be fairly regarded as Rockefeller’s man in theSenate.[15] [part0021.html#fn15]From the inception of the National Monetary Commission until the presentation ofits Aldrich plan to Congress four years later, Senator Aldrich and thecommission were a vitally important nucleus of the drive for a central bank.Particularly influential in the deliberations of the commission were two men whowere not official members. Aldrich asked J.P. Morgan to recommend a bankingexpert, and Morgan happily responded with Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner;the other unofficial member was George M. Reynolds of Chicago, president of theAmerican Bankers Association.[16] [part0021.html#fn16]Aldrich and the National Monetary Commission, however, were by no means the onlyfocus of the movement for a central bank. Another was Paul Moritz Warburg, oneof the most vital influences on the creation of the Federal Reserve System.Warburg, scion of the great international banking family and the Germaninvestment banking firm of M.M. Warburg and Company, of Hamburg, emigrated tothe United States in 1902 to become a partner in the influential New Yorkbanking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.[17] [part0021.html#fn17] From the moment hecame to the United States, Warburg worked tirelessly, in person and in print, tobring the blessings of European central banking to this monetarily backwardland. Sensitive to American political objections to the idea of centralizationor of Wall Street control, Warburg always insisted disingenuously that his planwas not really a central bank. His first printed banking reform essay came inJanuary 1907 in his “A Plan for a Modified Central Bank.” The plan called forcentralized reserves and a centralized note issue as a key to assuring economicstability. The most elaborate versions of Warburg’s reform plan were presentedin two speeches in 1910: “A United Reserve Bank of the United States” and“Principles that Must Underlie Monetary Reform in the United States.”Warburg’s United Reserve Bank delineated the major features of the futureFederal Reserve System. The key to its power was to be its legal monopoly on allnote issue in the United States; to obtain such notes, the banks would have tokeep their reserves at the Reserve Bank. Reserves would therefore be centralizedat long last. Depositors at the Bank would be strictly limited to the memberbanks and the federal government. The Bank was to be governed by a boardselected equally by three groups: the member banks, the stockholders of theReserve Bank, and the federal government. Not surprisingly, Warburg’s planrepeated the essential features of the operation of the German Reichsbank, thecentral bank in his native Germany.[18] [part0021.html#fn18]The greatest cheerleader for Warburg’s plan, and the man who introduced hisbanking reform essays to Columbia University’s Academy of Political Science, wasWarburg’s kinsman, the Columbia economist Edwin R.A. Seligman, of the investmentbanking family of J. & W. Seligman and Company.[19] [part0021.html#fn19]The top bankers were clear from the beginning that, to assuage widespread fearsof centralized and Wall Street control, they would have to avoid the appearanceof an orthodox central bank on the lines of England or Germany. The chosencourse was a spurious “regionalism” and “decentralization,” the appearance of avirtually uncoordinated set of regional central banks. The idea was in the airwhen Victor Morawetz made his famous speech in November 1909 calling forregional banking districts under the ultimate direction of one central controlboard. Although reserves and note issue would be pro forma decentralized in thehands of the regional reserve banks, all would really be centralized andcoordinated by the central control board. This specious decentralization was, ofcourse, the scheme eventually adopted in the Federal Reserve System.Who was Victor Morawetz? He was a distinguished attorney and banker and inparticular the counsel and chairman of the executive committee of theMorgan-controlled Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. In 1908, Morawetz hadbeen, along with J.P. Morgan’s personal lawyer, Francis Lynde Stetson, theprincipal drafter of an unsuccessful Morgan-National Civic Federation bill for afederal incorporation law that would have cartelized and regulated Americancorporations. Later, Morawetz was to be a top consultant to another“progressive” reform of Woodrow Wilson’s, the Federal Trade Commission.[20][part0021.html#fn20]In late 1910, someone in the Aldrich circle, probably Henry P. Davison, got theidea of convening a small group of leading advocates of a central bank in a topsecret conclave to draft a bill for a central bank. The clandestine meeting washeld in November at a duck-shooting retreat for wealthy members, the JekyllIsland Club on Jekyll Island, Georgia. The cover story given to the press wasthat the conferees were going down for a duck-hunting expedition. Extraordinarymeasures were taken to ensure secrecy, with the conferees traveling down toGeorgia under assumed names in a private railroad car chartered by Aldrich. Somereporters got wind of the meeting, but Davison managed to talk them out of anypublicity.[21] [part0021.html#fn21]The blue-ribbon participants at the week-long Jekyll Island meeting were:Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, Rockefeller in-lawHenry P. Davison, Morgan partnerPaul M. Warburg, Kuhn, Loeb & Co. partner[22] [part0021.html#fn22]Frank A. Vanderlip, vice-president of Rockefeller’s National City BankCharles D. Norton, president of Morgan’s First National Bank of New YorkA. Piatt Andrew, Harvard economist and staff assistant to Aldrich on theMonetary CommissionThere is no clearer physical embodiment of the cartelizing coalition of topfinancial and banking interests that brought the Federal Reserve System intobeing than the sometimes allied, often clashing Rockefeller-Kuhn, Loeb andMorgan interests, aided by economic technicians.Using the research of the National Monetary Commission, the Jekyll Islandconclave drafted a bill for a central bank. The ideas of this draft, whicheventually became the Aldrich Bill, were basically Paul Warburg’s, with adecentralized soupcon taken from Morawetz. The final writing was contributed byVanderlip. The main disagreement at the meeting was that Aldrich wanted to holdout for a straightforward central bank on the European model, whereas Warburgand the other banks, oddly enough more politically astute on this issue than theveteran senator, insisted that the reality of central banking be clothed in thepalatable garb of decentralization. The Jekyll Island draft was presented byAldrich to the full National Monetary Commission in January 1911. Slightlyrevised, it was introduced, together with the commission report, a year later asthe Aldrich Bill, which in turn became in all essentials the final FederalReserve Act passed in December 1913.In the Aldrich-Jekyll Island plan, the central bank with branches was called theNational Reserve Association; the main difference between the draft and theeventual legislation is that in the former, the national board of directors waslargely chosen by the banks themselves rather than by the president of theUnited States. This provision was so blatantly cartelist that it was modifiedfor political reasons to have the president name the board. The economist HenryParker Willis, who played a large role in the enactment of the Federal ReserveSystem, lamented this alteration: “Political prejudice proved too strong for theestablishment of this form of financial self-government or ‘integration’.”[23][part0021.html#fn23]Aldrich and the Monetary Commission took the unusual step of delaying theirreport to Congress for 12 months, from January 1911 to January 1912. With theDemocratic victory in the congressional elections of 1910, it was necessary tospend a year drumming up support for a central bank among Democrats, bankers,and the lay public. Accordingly, at the beginning of February 1911, twenty-twotop bankers from 12 cities met for three days behind closed doors in AtlanticCity to consider the Aldrich plan; the conference warmly endorsed the plan. Inthe private deliberation, James B. Forgan, President of theRockefeller-dominated First National Bank of Chicago, declared outright thateveryone there approved of the Aldrich plan and that, as Kolko puts it, “thereal purpose of the conference was to discuss winning the banking community overto government control directed by the bankers for their own ends. ... It wasgenerally appreciated that the [Aldrich plan] would increase the power of thebig national banks to compete with the rapidly growing state banks, help bringthe state banks under control, and strengthen the position of the national banksin foreign banking activities.”[24] [part0021.html#fn24]In November 1911, Aldrich won support for his plan from the American BankersAssociation. In his address to their convention, he declared: “The organizationproposed is not a bank, but a cooperative union of all the banks of the countryfor definite purposes.”[25] [part0021.html#fn25]The major propaganda organization created for the benefit of the lay public byAldrich and his colleagues in the spring of 1911 was the National Citizens’League for the Creation of a Sound Banking System. The league grew out of aresolution that Paul Warburg had pushed through a meeting of the National Boardof Trade in January 1910, setting aside January 18 of the following year as a“monetary day” devoted to a “Business Men’s Monetary Conference.” At thatJanuary 1911 meeting the conference appointed a committee of seven, headed byWarburg, to organize a business-leaders’ monetary reform league. A group ofleading Chicago businessmen, headed by John V. Farwell and Harry A. Wheeler,president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, established the National Citizens’League, with economist J. Laurence Laughlin of the University of Chicago asoperating head.Warburg and the other New York bankers chose Chicago as the site of theCitizens’ League to give the organization a bogus appearance of grass rootspopulism. In reality, banker control was virtually complete. The stated purposeof the league was to advance the cause of “cooperation, with dominantcentralization of all banks by an evolution out of our clearing-houseexperience”; a decade later, Professor Henry Parker Willis, Laughlin’s topassistant at the league as well as former student and long-time disciple,conceded that the Citizens’ League had been the propaganda organ of the nation’sbankers.[26] [part0021.html#fn26]There is no need to go into the minutiae of the splits within the Citizens’League or of the shift by the incoming Democrats in 1913 from the dreadedRepublican name of Aldrich to a bill named by their own Representative CarterClass. Much of this conflict revolved around the desire by Laughlin and theDemocrats, and to some extent by Warburg, to shed the name Aldrich for a morepalatable one. Nevertheless, there was very little substantive differencebetween the Glass bill, which became the Federal Reserve Act, and the originalAldrich plan. Friedman and Schwartz are surely correct in insisting on the “nearidentity” of the two plans.[27] [part0021.html#fn27] The important point is thatwhatever the difference on minor technical points, the nation’s bankers, andespecially the big bankers, were overwhelmingly in favor of a new central bank.As A. Barton Hepburn of the Chase National exulted at the annual meeting of theAmerican Bankers Association in August 1913, in the course of his successfuleffort to get the bankers to endorse the Glass bill: “The measure recognized andadopts the principles of a central bank. Indeed, if it works out as the sponsorsof the law hope, it will make all incorporated banks together joint owners of acentral dominating power.”[28] [part0021.html#fn28] Precisely.All in all, Professor Kolko sums up the point well:> The entire banking reform movement, at all crucial stages, was centralized in> the hands of a few men who for years were linked, ideologically and> personally, with one another. The problem of the origin of the Federal Reserve> Act, and the authorship of specific drafts, was later hotly debated by [men]> who greatly exaggerated their differences in order that they might each claim> responsibility for the guiding lines of the Federal Reserve System. Yet ...> although they may have differed on details they agreed on major policy lines> and general theory. The confusion over the precise authorship of the Federal> Reserve Act should not obscure the fact that the major function, inspiration,> and direction of the measure was to serve the banking community in general,> and large bankers specifically.[29] [part0021.html#fn29]3. THE STRUCTURE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVEThe structure of the Federal Reserve System—which was enacted in December 1913and opened its doors the following November—was at once cartelizing andinflationary.[30] [part0021.html#fn30] The cartelizing nature of the Fed can beseen in its organization: an intimate partnership between the federal governmentand the nation’s banking community. There are 12 regional and district FederalReserve Banks, the stock of which is held by the member banks in the district.Each Bank is governed by nine directors, of whom three are chosen directly bythe banks in the district; three others are supposed to represent commerce,agriculture, or industry, but they too are chosen by the member banks in thedistrict. That leaves only three directors appointed by the overall FederalReserve Board in Washington. Furthermore, of the three publicly appointeddirectors, one—who becomes the chairman of the district Bank—must be a person oftested banking experience: in short, an ex-banker.Not only are six—arguably seven—of each Bank’s directors private bankers, butthe chief executive officer of each Bank (originally called the governor and nowthe president) is appointed by the Bank directors themselves, not by the centralReserve Board (even though the latter must approve the choice). The centralboard has seven members, two of whom must be former bankers; all are appointedby the president of the United States.Some critics of the Federal Reserve assert that it is really and simply aprivate central bank, since it is owned wholly by its member banks and it makesprofits from its policies. But this view ignores the fact that all profits madeby the Banks are now taxed away by the treasury. The point of the cartel is notmake profits directly as shareholders of each Reserve Bank, but to benefit fromthe cartelizing and inflationary policies of the entire system.At the same time, those who maintain that the Federal Reserve System is a whollygovernment-controlled institution overstate the case. It is true that allmembers of the Federal Reserve Board are government appointed and that alldistrict Bank officials are instructed to act within the guidelines set by theBoard. But every governor (or president) of a Federal Reserve Bank is selectedlargely by the bankers of the district, and these governors can exert aconsiderable amount of influence on Fed policy.[31] [part0021.html#fn31] As wewill see below, the banker-elected governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork seized the reins of power from the Federal Reserve Board from the inceptionof the system in 1914 until his death 14 years later.The Federal Reserve System, like all central banking systems, is inherentlyinflationary. In the first place, the central bank acts as a lender of lastresort, a giant governmentally privileged institution standing ready to bail outbanks in trouble. Second, by coordinating bank activities, the central bank canpump in new reserves throughout the system and thereby induce a multipleexpansion of bank money and credit. Since the banks can inflate uniformly,individual expanding banks no longer suffer from the constraining redemptions bynonexpanding banks that prevail in a regime of free and decentralized banking.If a bank expands credit on its own, it will soon find that its expanded notesor deposits will be passed on from its own clients to clients of other banks andthat in the normal course of business they will be returned to the expandingbank for redemption. Yet the expanding bank will not have the funds to redeemthese claims. There is also a third reason, which might not be as evident: Evenif legal reserve requirements remain the same, the centralizing of reserves intothe hands of the Fed by itself permits a considerable inflation of money andcredit. In short, if before the establishment of a central bank every bank keepsits own cash reserves, and if afterward most of the cash is deposited in thecentral bank, the bank can then pyramid its own liabilities on top of its cash,thereby exerting a multiple leverage effect on the previously existing cash. Inan illuminating book on the Federal Reserve and the Great Depression, Phillips,McManus, and Nelson summarize this process:> Thus, if the commercial banks prior to the inauguration of a system of> bankers’ banking are required to hold an average reserve, say, of 10 percent> against deposit liabilities, their deposits may be ten times that reserve, or,> they may expand credit roughly on a ten-fold basis. With the reserves of the> commercial banks transferred to the Federal Reserve Banks, and with the latter> required to maintain a reserve of only 35 percent against the deposit> labilities due to the member banks, credit expansion may, at its utmost,> proceed to approximately thirty times the amount of the reserves. Thus is seen> that the establishment of a central banking system [in the United States]> magnified the former expansive power virtually three-fold.[32]> [part0021.html#fn32]This statement overlooks the fact that the pre-Federal Reserve banking systemwas not free and decentralized, and it therefore exaggerates the quantitativeinflationary effect of the creation of the Fed. But the basic point is correct.A fourth inflationary effect of the creation of the Fed is inherent not so muchin its structure as in the legal power to change the reserve requirement of thebanks. Thus, before the enactment of the Fed, the average minimum reserverequirement for the nation’s banks was 21.1%. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913slashed those reserve requirements to an average of 11.6%, a reduction of 45%.Four years later, in June 1917, reserve requirements were further lowered to anaverage of 9.8%—a cut of 54% since 1913. In short, added to whatever multipleinflation of money and credit was permitted by the centralization inherent inthe existence of the Fed, a twofold expansion in four years was permitted by theslash in reserve requirements.[33] [part0021.html#fn33] Furthermore, in aninflationary move that was to become highly significant in the 1920s, theFederal Reserve Act drastically lowered the reserve requirements for timedeposits in the banks. Previously, there had been no distinction in the legalreserve requirements between demand and time deposits; both had thereforeaveraged 21.1%. Now, however, the requirement for time deposits was lowered to5% and then to a negligible 3% in June 1917.[34] [part0021.html#fn34]4. THE PERSONNEL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVEThe people in positions of power in America’s new central bank were at least asimportant as its structure. The bankers, warmly hailing the enactment of theFederal Reserve, waited eagerly to see who would be running the powerful newinstitution.[35] [part0021.html#fn35]Of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, two were (by statute at thetime) ex officio, the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller of thecurrency. Before assuming their posts in the Wilson administration, these twomen had been close business and financial associates. Secretary of the TreasuryWilliam Gibbs McAdoo had been a failing businessman in New York City when he wasbefriended and bailed out by J.P. Morgan and his associates. The Morgans setMcAdoo up as president of New York’s Hudson & Manhattan Railroad until hisappointment in the Wilson administration. McAdoo spent the rest of his financialand political life securely in the Morgan ambit. When he was president of theHudson & Manhattan for a decade, McAdoo’s fellow officers and board members werevirtually all Morgan men. His vice-presidents were Edmund C. Converse, presidentof the Morgan-run Bankers Trust Company, and Walter G. Oakman, president ofMorgan’s flagship commercial bank, Guaranty Trust. His fellow directors includedJudge Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the board of Morgan’s attempted steelmonopoly, U.S. Steel, and a director of another failed Morgan monopoly attempt,International Harvester, Frederic B. Jennings, partner in the “Morgan” law firmof Stetson, Jennings & Russell (whose senior partner, Francis Lynde Stetson, wasJ.P.’s personal attorney), and John G. McCullough, a director of theMorgan-controlled Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Directors of Hudson &Manhattan’s parent company, the Hudson Companies, included William C. Lane, avice-president of Guaranty Trust, and Grant B. Schley, a brother-in-law of oneof the country’s top Morgan lieutenants, George F. Baker, head of the FirstNational Bank of New York. Shortly after his appointment as secretary of thetreasury, William McAdoo cemented his political stature by marrying PresidentWilson’s daughter.[36] [part0021.html#fn36]The comptroller of the currency was a long-time associate of McAdoo’s. AVirginia banker and president of the Richmond Trust & Safe Deposit Company, JohnSkelton Williams had been a director of McAdoo’s Hudson & Manhattan Railroad andpresident of the Morgan-oriented Seaboard Airline Railway. When McAdoo becamesecretary of the treasury, he appointed Williams as one of his two assistantsecretaries.One of President Wilson’s five appointees to the Federal Reserve Board wasanother close associate of McAdoo’s, Charles S. Hamlin, whom McAdoo hadappointed as his other assistant secretary. Hamlin was a Boston attorney who hadmarried into the wealthy Pruyn family of Albany, a family long connected withthe Morgan-dominated New York Central Railroad.Of the other Wilson appointees to the board, one was none other than Paul M.Warburg. Others were Frederic A. Delano, uncle of Franklin D. Roosevelt andpresident of the Rockefeller-controlled Wabash Railway, William P.G. Harding,president of the First National Bank of Birmingham, Alabama, and son-in-law ofJoseph H. Woodward, head of the Woodward Iron Company, which had severalprominent Morgan and Rockefeller men on its board, and finally, Professor AdolphC. Miller, economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Miller hadmarried into the wealthy, Morgan-connected Sprague family of Chicago. Hisfather-in-law, Otho S.A. Sprague, had been a prominent businessman and hadserved as a director of the Morgan-dominated Pullman Company. Miller’s wife’suncle, Albert A. Sprague, was a director of numerous large firms, including theChicago Telephone Company, a subsidiary of the mighty Morgan-controlled monopolyAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Company.[37] [part0021.html#fn37]The Federal Reserve Board thus began its existence with three Morgan men, oneperson in the Rockefeller ambit, a leader of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (allied with theRockefellers), a prominent Alabama banker, and an economist with vague familyconnections to Morgan interests. No board could have better symbolized thealliance of banking and financial interests, aided by a few economists, that hadconceived and successfully driven through a radical transformation of theAmerican banking system.But more important from the inception of the Fed through the 1920s was the manappointed as governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who swiftly tookcontrol of the policies of the system. Benjamin Strong had spent virtually hisentire business and personal life in the circle of top aides of J.P. Morgan.Secretary of several trust companies in New York City, Strong lived in the thenwealthy suburb of Englewood, New Jersey, where he became close friends of threetop Morgan partners: Henry P. Davison, Thomas W. Lamont, and Dwight Morrow.Davison in particular became Strong’s mentor and in 1904 offered him the post ofsecretary of the new Morgan-created Bankers Trust Company. Strong soon marriedthe daughter of the wealthy Edmund C. Converse, then president of Bankers Trust,and succeeded Thomas W. Lamont as vice-president. Not long after, Strong wasacting as virtual president of Bankers Trust under the aging Converse, and inJanuary 1914, he officially became president of the company.Strong had favored central banking reform at least since 1907, and in August1911 he participated with Nelson Aldrich in a lengthy meeting on the Aldrichplan with Davison, Vanderlip, and a few other leading bankers on Aldrich’syacht. He also spoke before the American Bankers Association on its behalf.When, at the suggestion of his close friend Warburg, Strong was offered the postof governor of the New York Fed, he at first refused, since he wanted a “realcentral bank ... run from New York by a board of directors on the ground”—inshort, a frankly and openly Wall Street-run cartelized banking system. After aweekend in the country, Davison and Warburg persuaded Strong to change his mindand accept; presumably, he now realized that he could achieve a Wall Street-runcartel on a little less candid basis from his powerful new post at the heart ofthe nation’s money market. Strong became governor of the New York Fed in October1914.[38] [part0021.html#fn38]Strong moved for seizure of commanding power shortly after the organization ofthe Federal Reserve System. At the organizing convention of the system inOctober 1914, an extra-legal council of governors was formed. At the firstmeeting of the council in December, Benjamin Strong became chairman not only ofthe council but also of its operating executive committee. From then on, Strongacted as chairman of the governors and assumed the dominant powers that thestatute had envisioned for the Federal Reserve Board. William P.G. Harding, whobecame governor (now chairman) of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington in1916, cracked down on the meetings of the council, but Strong continued as thedominant force in the system, a position ensured by his being named the soleagent for the open-market operations of all the Federal Reserve Banks.[39][part0021.html#fn39]Two years after the establishment of the Federal Reserve and a year before theAmerican entry into World War I, Representative Carter Class, a Democrat fromVirginia who had drawn up the final Federal Reserve bill in the House, lookedback on his cartelizing handiwork and found it good. He pointed out that hisobjective was very far from injuring Wall Street financial dominance:> The proponents of the Federal reserve had no idea of impairing the rightful> prestige of New York as the financial metropolis of this hemisphere. They> rather expected to confirm its distinction, and even hoped to assist> powerfully in wresting this scepter from London and eventually making New York> the financial center of the world. ... Indeed, momentarily this has come to> pass. And we may point to the amazing contrast between New York under the old> system in 1907, shaken to its very foundations because of two bank failures,> and New York at the present time, under the new system, serenely secure in its> domestic banking operations and confidently financing the great enterprises of> European nations at war.[40] [part0021.html#fn40]However, there was still a problem: the failure of the state-chartered banks tojoin the Federal Reserve System. All national banks were compelled by law tojoin the system and to keep their reserves with the Fed, but the eagerness withwhich they joined is revealed by the fact that virtually no national banksabandoned their national status to seek state charters. State banks were free tojoin or not, and a bane of the Fed’s existence is that virtually none of themdid so, preferring the lesser regulation of state law.In a letter of October 1916, Benjamin Strong lamented the situation, writing:“Frankly, our bankers are more or less an unorganized mob. Until they areeducated by experience to the advantages of cooperation through the ReserveSystem, I believe it is unsafe to rely upon reserves contributed by theirvoluntary action.”[41] [part0021.html#fn41] In such a vein has every cartelistreacted to the ambitions of individual firms or entrepreneurs to kick over thecollective discipline of the cartel. All Fed officials felt the same way, andonly political considerations have thus far prevented compulsory membership.5. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND WORLD WAR IThe Federal Reserve System arrived fortuitously for the financing of U.S. entryinto World War I, for it is doubtful whether the government would have beenpolitically able to finance the war through taxes, borrowing from the public, orthe simple printing of greenbacks. As it was, the Fed was able to engineer thedoubling of the money supply from its inception in 1914 until 1919.World War I also led to a strengthening of the power of the Federal ReserveSystem and particularly of the dominance of Benjamin Strong and the FederalReserve Bank. With banking subject to treasury demands for financing the hugedeficits, Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo and Benjamin Strong assumed virtualjoint control of the Federal Reserve. As Willis wrote, “It was the entry of theUnited States into the World War that finally cast a decisive vote in favor of astill further degree of high centralization; and that practically guaranteedsome measure of fulfillment for the ambitions that had centered around theFederal Reserve Bank of New York.”[42] [part0021.html#fn42]Strong’s new dominance was facilitated by the treasury’s making the FederalReserve its sole fiscal agent. The secretary of the treasury had not done sobefore the war arrived, instead continuing the Jacksonian policy of depositingthe disbursing funds from its own sub-treasury branches (the IndependentTreasury System). Under the spur of war, however, McAdoo fulfilled Strong’slong-standing ambition; the Fed was now clothed with full governmental power.Strong had previously written: “We must, if possible, persuade [McAdoo] topermit the Reserve Banks to become the real, active, and effective fiscal agentsfor the Government. If he does that, our place in the country’s banking systemwill be established for all time.”[43] [part0021.html#fn43] Strong’s biographersummarizes how treasury operations during the war accelerated the dominance ofthe New York Fed:> The war and the delegation of fiscal agency had a special effect on the New> York Bank and on Strong’s position in the System. Situated in the nation’s> great central money market, the New York Bank sold and distributed nearly half> of all securities offered by the Treasury during the war and collected and> disbursed great sums of money. At the country’s foreign exchange center and> gateway to Europe, it handled most of the Treasury’s foreign exchange> business, made many financial arrangements for the Treasury with foreign> countries, acted as a central depository of funds from the other Reserve Banks> as well as the New York district for payment to the representatives of foreign> countries or to suppliers of munitions to them, and was the principal> purchaser of acceptances.

[44]> [part0021.html#fn44]Moreover, Strong had long wished to concentrate the country’s gold coin andbullion in the hands of the Federal Reserve and outside the control of thepublic. In that way, cartelization would be intensified, and the inflationarypotential of the Fed, which pyramided its own notes and deposits on top of itsgold stock, would greatly increase. In 1917, in view of the war, the law waschanged to permit the Federal Reserve to issue notes in exchange for gold(previously it could only issue them for commercial notes) and to require alllegal bank reserves to be kept as deposits at the Fed rather than in cash.Furthermore, relaxed federal regulations on state banks in 1917 finally induceda considerable number of state banks to join the system, intensifying theconcentration of reserves and of gold still further. Finally, from September1917 to June 1919, the United States went implicitly, though not formally, offthe gold standard—at least for foreigners. Foreign exchange operations werecontrolled and gold exports prohibited. As a result of all of these measures,gold was virtually nationalized and successfully concentrated at the Fed. At theend of 1916, the gold reserves of the Reserve Banks were only $720 million, or28% of the country’s monetary gold stock. Two years later, gold reserves at theFed were up to $2.1 billion, or no less than 74% of the nation’s gold.6. INTERNATIONALIZING THE CARTELThe fortunes of the House of Morgan had been declining since the turn of thecentury, and so the Morgans saw a glorious opportunity open to them upon theoutbreak of the war in Europe. The Morgans had close and long-time financialconnections with England. In particular, Edward Grenfell (later Lord St. Just),senior partner of Morgan, Grenfell & Co., the London branch of J.P. Morgan &Co., was also a long-time director of the Bank of England. Grenfell had longbeen the main informal link between the Bank of England and the New Yorkfinancial community, and the relationship was formalized when the Morgan Bankbecame the fiscal agent of the Bank of England.[45] [part0021.html#fn45] Led bypartner Henry P. Davison at the end of 1914, the Morgans got themselves namedvirtually sole purchasing agent in the United States for British and French wargoods. To pay for this immense export of arms and other materiel, the Britishand French were obliged to float immense loans in the United States, and theHouse of Morgan became the sole underwriter for these Allied bonds in the UnitedStates. Not only did Morgan find these monopolies highly profitable, but itprospered relative to its great rival Kuhn, Loeb & Co.—which, being German andconnected with German banking and finance, was excluded from Allied waroperations. As the Morgans and the bond market geared up to finance massivemunitions and other exports to the Allies, Davison’s old friend and colleagueBenjamin Strong stood ready to inflate money and credit to finance these foreignloans.[46] [part0021.html#fn46] The Wilson administration and the FederalReserve Board were prepared to do likewise.[47] [part0021.html#fn47]Benjamin Strong had scarcely been appointed when he began planning for aninternational cartel, a regime of “international cooperation” between theleading central banks of the world. In practice, such high-sounding terms couldmean only cooperation for world monetary expansion. The classical gold standard,which basically prevailed before World War I, placed a firm restraint on thepropensity of national central banks to inflate: The expansion of one country’scurrency would raise nominal income and prices in that country, cause a deficitin its balance of payments and an outflow of gold, thereby causing a check oninflation and perhaps a compulsion on the central bank to deflate back to itsprevious position. International central bank “cooperation” (or cartelization)then and now means the establishment of formal and informal mechanisms toprevent pressures for redemption and contraction on an inflating nation’scurrency. If this were not the meaning, there would be no need for internationalcooperation or indeed for central banking at all, since all any individual bankneed do to keep itself afloat is to keep its rate of inflating to a minimum.In the latter part of 1915, Benjamin Strong worked on international central bankcollaboration, and in February 1916, he sailed to Europe to launch the firststep: the establishment of the banks of England and France as foreign agents orcorrespondents for the New York Fed. Strong had long admired the central bankingrecord of the Bank of England, and close collaboration with that leading centralbank was to be the keystone of the new regime of inter-central bankcartelization. In England in March, Strong worked out an agreement of closecollaboration between the New York Fed and the Bank of England, with both banksmaintaining an account with each other and the Bank of England purchasingsterling bills on account for the New York Bank. In his usual high-handedmanner, Strong expressed his determination to go ahead with the agreement evenif the other Reserve Banks objected or failed to go along. Finally, after somebacking and filling, the Federal Reserve Board endorsed the scheme as well asthe initiating of a similar agreement with the Bank of France.[48][part0021.html#fn48]Strong made his agreement with the governor of the Bank of England, LordCunliffe, but his most fateful meeting in England was with the then assistant tothe deputy governor, Montagu Norman. This meeting proved the beginning of themomentous Strong-Norman collaboration that highlighted the internationalfinancial world of the 1920s.[49] [part0021.html#fn49]Montagu Collet Norman was born to banking on both sides of his family. Hisfather was a partner in the British banking house of Martin & Co. and wasrelated to the great banking family of Barings. His uncle was indeed a partnerof Baring Bros. Norman’s mother was the daughter of Mark W. Collet, a partner inthe international banking firm of Brown Shipley & Co. Brown Shipley was theLondon branch of the great Wall Street banking firm of Brown Brothers.Grandfather Mark Collet, furthermore, had been governor of the Bank of Englandin the 1880s.At the age of twenty-one, young Norman began his working life at the family bankof Martin & Co., and then at Brown Shipley. In 1895, he went to work at the NewYork office of Brown Brothers, where he stayed for three years, returning toLondon to become a partner of Brown Shipley in 1900.Strong and Norman became close friends as well as collaborators almostimmediately, writing a steady stream of correspondence, personal and financial,and visiting each other at length every year from 1919 until Strong’s death in1928. They spent long vacations together, sometimes at Bar Harbor or Saratogabut more often in southern France.7. BRITAIN AND THE GOLD EXCHANGE STANDARDBritain, the major gold standard country before World War I, ended the warfacing a set of grave, interlocking financial and economic problems, most of itsown making. Along with the other warring nations, Britain had inflated sharplyto finance the war effort. Each country except the United States (which had defacto suspended gold exports) had therefore been obliged to go off the goldstandard. At the end of World War I, Britain determined that its own and theworld’s economic health required a return to the gold standard. And, in afateful decision, it also determined—with surprisingly little discussion—thatthe pound sterling would have to be reestablished at the traditional prewar parof approximately $4.86.[50] [part0021.html#fn50] Because of the greaterinflation in Britain than in the United States, the free-market exchange rate ofthe two currencies was far lower than $4.86. The British government, with thehelp of J.P. Morgan & Co., succeeded in artificially pegging the pound at $4.75from early 1916 until March 1919. Finally, the British let the pound float, andit quickly plummeted, reaching a low of $3.21 in February 1920.[51][part0021.html#fn51]Britain’s curious insistence on returning to the gold standard at a parovervalued by some 34% meant that the British had to face a massive pricedeflation. It was particularly important for Britain—dependent as it always hasbeen on exports to purchase large quantities of imports—to keep its exportprices competitive, and for that, deflation would be necessary. Althoughdifficult at all times, deflation did not present major problems before WorldWar I, since price and wage rates were flexible downward. But during the war, amassive system of high-benefit unemployment insurance and a strong network oftrade unions had developed in Britain, making deflation impossible without therepeal of welfare state measures and the rolling back of trade union power.Britain was not willing to take such heroic measures; in fact it wished tocontinue permanently the pleasant system of cheap credit and inflation that ithad pursued during the war. Yet it continued to insist on an unrealistic $4.86par in order to regain London’s prewar prestige as the world’s financial center.Britain, in short, insisted on resting its postwar foreign monetary policy on apair of inconsistent but fiercely held axioms: (1) a return to gold at theovervalued prewar par and (2) a refusal to permit the deflation needed to makeaxiom 1 at all viable. In fact, it insisted on continuing an inflationarypolicy. Britain’s entire international financial policy during the 1920s was anattempt to square the circle, to maintain these two inconsistent axioms.How could it do so? First, Britain would have to force or cajole other countrieseither to inflate themselves, so that Britain would not lose gold to them, or toreturn to a peculiar new form of gold standard, which would retain the prestigeof gold without the content. Thus, Britain, operating particularly through theFinancial Committee of the League of Nations (an organization that itcontrolled), induced or forced the vanquished or small victor states of postwarEurope (1) to return to gold at overvalued pars, thereby crippling their exportsand subsidizing British imports, (2) to acquire their own central banks, so thatthey too could inflate in collaboration with the Bank of England, to discourageexports or gold from flowing from Britain, and (3), and perhaps most important,to return not to a classical gold standard but to a new form of “gold exchangestandard.” In a genuine gold standard, each currency is backed by gold, and goldflows in or out of the country. In the new form, each European country wasexpected to keep its reserves not in gold, but in pounds sterling, which wouldbe backed by gold. Then, when Britain inflated, instead of losing gold to othercountries, the sterling balances would pile up in London and themselves be usedas a base on which to pyramid European currencies.Britain was further protected from its inflationary policies in the 1920s bypledging to redeem pounds not in gold coin, as before the war, but only inlarge-denomination gold bullion. This ensured that gold could not circulatewithin the country and that gold would only be redeemed by large-scaleinternational holders.Having manipulated most of the European countries into ceasing to become athreat to its inflationary policies, Britain was still faced with the problem ofthe United States. The danger was that a non-inflating, hard-money, genuinelygold standard country such as the United States would soon drain inflatingBritain of its gold and thereby wreck the new jerry-built international monetarysystem. Britain, therefore, had to persuade the United States to inflate paripassu with Great Britain; in particular, U.S. price levels could be no lowerthan Britain’s and its interest rates no higher, so that gold funds would not beattracted out of London and into the United States. To persuade the UnitedStates to inflate—ostensibly in order to help Britain return to the goldstandard—then became the premier task of Montagu Norman.[52][part0021.html#fn52]Later in the 1920s, Emile Moreau, governor of the Bank of France and a caustichard-money critic of Britain’s international financial policy, recorded in hisdiary that England had established> a basis for putting Europe under a virtual financial domination. The Financial> Committee [of the League of Nations] at Geneva has been the instrument of that> policy. The method consists of forcing every country in monetary difficulty to> subject itself to the Committee at Geneva, which the British control. The> remedies prescribed always involve the installation in the central bank of a> foreign supervisor who is British or designated at the Bank of England, which> serves both to support the pound and to fortify British influence. To> guarantee against possible failure they are careful to secure the cooperation> of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Moreover, they pass on to America the> task of making some of the foreign loans if they seem too heavy, always> retaining the political advantages of these operations.[53]> [part0021.html#fn53]Moreau also recorded a fascinating report sent by his close aide in 1926 on theintentions of Montagu Norman. The aide reported that the chief objective ofNorman and his group was> the setting up of links between the various Banks of Issue. ... The economic> and financial organization of the world appears to the Governor of the Bank of> England to be the major task of the Twentieth Century. ... Hence his campaign> in favour of completely autonomous central banks, dominating their own> financial markets and deriving their power from common agreement among> themselves.[54] [part0021.html#fn54]Norman succeeded in getting the nations of Europe to agree to adopt the postwargold exchange standard at the Genoa Conference, called by the Supreme Council ofthe Allies in April 1922. All of the details of the financial world of the 1920swere agreed on then by the Financial Commission of the Conference. Britainactually adopted this standard in 1925, and the other European nations followedat about the same time. The United States had decided at the last minute not toparticipate at Genoa because of Soviet participation, but the administration,especially the powerful Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, was enthusiasticabout the idea of inter-central bank collaboration of currencystabilization.[55] [part0021.html#fn55]8. OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES IN THE 1920SThe Federal Reserve generated a monetary expansion averaging approximately 7%per annum in the great boom years from 1921 to 1929, an expansion propelled byan average annual increase of member bank reserves of 6% per year.[56][part0021.html#fn56] By far the most important factor in generating theincreased reserves was open-market purchases by the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork. The purchases came in three great bursts: in 1921–22, in 1924, and in thelatter half of 1927. In the first surge, the Fed tripled its holding ofgovernment securities from $193 million in November 1921 to $603 million in June1922. This was the Fed’s famous “discovery” of the inflationary effect ofopen-market purchases, a discovery that the authorities were delighted to make.Before the war, there had been little government securities available on themarket and almost no short-run floating treasury debt. There was thereforelittle scope for open-market operations as a deliberate expansionary orrestrictive policy even if this method had been discovered. After World War I,however, there was suddenly a large mass of short-term floating debt on themarket that needed to be rolled over.[57] [part0021.html#fn57] The FederalReserve purchased the massive amounts in 1921–22 largely to acquireincome-earning assets during the era of business recession. It then saw to itsdelight that a new and powerful instrument of monetary expansion and inflationhad been discovered.That this discovery was, to an extent, anticipated by Benjamin Strong isindicated by a letter he wrote on April 18, 1922, to Undersecretary of theTreasury S. Parker Gilbert, who had wondered about the Fed’s unusually largepurchases of government securities. Strong explained that the policy had beendesigned not only to add to the Fed’s income-earning assets but also “toestablish a level of interest rates, or at least to maintain rates at a level,which would facilitate foreign borrowing in this country” and thus would assure“more stable conditions and [would] facilitate business improvement.” Thisindicates that, at least to some degree, Strong bought the securities in orderto push interest rates lower, to expand money and credit, and to stimulate aneconomic upturn.[58] [part0021.html#fn58]The expanded open-market operations led Governor Strong to reconvene thegovernors conference on a regular and systematized basis. In May 1922, theconference set up an executive committee that would henceforth centralize andexecute open-market operations for the entire system; Benjamin Strong was, notcoincidentally, made chairman of this governors committee.[59][part0021.html#fn59] From that point on, and particularly from the time of thesecond committee meeting in October 1922, Strong was conducting open-marketpurchases and sales for the entire system, instead of merely functioning as anagent and processing orders from other regional Reserve Banks.Strong fell ill in February 1923 and was out sick until October. Shortly after,in April, the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, prodded by Adolph Miller,took steps to try to take dominance of the system away from the absent Strong.The board dissolved the extralegal governors committee and reconstituted a newone—the Open Market Investment Committee—strictly under the control of theboard. With Strong temporarily gone, the board managed to force the New York Fedto sell most of its remaining government securities, for Miller, and thetreasury as well, had continued to be uneasy at the large open-market purchasesthe Fed had made the previous year. Strong was furious both at the loss of hispower and at the sale of securities, which he feared would cause a recession. InNovember, however, Strong came roaring back, seizing control of the FederalReserve from that point until his final illness in the spring of 1928. Regaininghis power over the Open Market Investment Committee, Strong, as chairman,created a Special System Investment Account at the New York Fed into whichcommittee purchases and holdings were put. He also let it be known that he wouldexpand such purchases whenever any economic downturn loomed: “The Reserve Systemshould not hesitate to resume open-market purchases, thereby again reducing bankborrowings and easing money rates, rather than permit an unwarranted state ofmind alone to disturb the even course of the country’s production andconsumption.”[60] [part0021.html#fn60]The next big burst of inflationary credit expansion came in 1924. Shortly afterStrong’s return, he began to purchase securities on a massive scale, buying $492million from October 1923 through 1924. The overriding reason was thedetermination to help Britain and Montagu Norman return to gold at itsovervalued par. To do so, the United States had to embark on an inflationary,cheap money policy to lower interest rates and raise prices relative to Britainso that Britain would not lose gold to the United States. In 1922, Norman hadhailed the easy credit and drop in interest rates to match Britain’s creditexpansion. During that and the following year, Norman continued to pepper Strongwith appeals and demands for further extensions of credit in the United States.But Strong felt that the time was not yet ripe.Finally, in 1924, with Britain’s return to the gold standard looming thefollowing year, Strong felt that the time was ripe, and the massive open-marketpurchases began. Furthermore, the pound sterling, which had risen to $4.61 bythe end of 1922 with news of the impending return to gold, had fallen sharply to$4.34 by mid-1924. Only massive inflationary pressure in the United States couldraise the pound to $4.86.Strong set forth his basic policies in a lengthy letter on May 27, 1924, toSecretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon:> There still remains the serious problem of the disparity of price levels in> the different countries due to monetary disturbances and currency inflation,> the correction of which must be undertaken before a return to actual gold> payment will be safe. This may be illustrated by the case of British prices> and our own. The pound sterling is, roughly, at 10 percent discount measured> in our gold currency ...> > At the present time it is probably true that British prices for goods> internationally dealt in are as a whole, roughly, in the neighborhood of 10> percent above our prices and one of the preliminaries to the re-establishment> of gold payment by Great Britain will be to facilitate a gradual readjustment> of these price levels before monetary reform is undertaken. In other words,> this means some small advance in prices here and possibly some small decline> in their prices. ... No one can direct price changes. They will be to a> certain extent fortuitous, but can be facilitated by cooperation between the> Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System in the maintaining of lower> interest rates in this country and higher interest rates in England so that we> will become the world’s borrowing market to a greater extent, and London to a> less extent. The burden of this readjustment must fall more largely upon us> than them. It will be difficult politically and socially for the British> Government and the Bank of England to force a price liquidation in England> beyond what they have already experienced in face of the fact that their trade> is poor and they have over a million unemployed people receiving government> aid.[61] [part0021.html#fn61]The inflationary open-market purchases led to a fall of interest rates in theUnited States below Britain by mid-1924. Sterling rose again, reaching $4.78 bythe spring of 1925. Britain resumed the gold standard at the prewar par by theend of the year. This resumption was further aided by the New York Fed’s loan ofa line of credit of $200 million to Britain, accompanied by a similar credit of$100 million to Britain by J.P. Morgan & Co.[62] [part0021.html#fn62]The final great burst of inflation, and the most intense of the 1920s, came inthe latter half of 1927, when the Federal Reserve purchased $225 million ofgovernment securities and $220 million of banker’s acceptances, adding $445million to bank reserves from these two sets of purchases alone.[63][part0021.html#fn63]The problem was that Britain’s return to the gold standard quickly proved anunhappy one. The sharp rise in the value of sterling put great pressure onBritain’s already depressed exports, especially on the coal industry. Britain’schronic depression intensified and rigid wage rates intensified unemployment. Ageneral strike and a lengthy coal mine strike in 1926 were the directconsequence of the return to gold at an overvalued par. Instead of deflating,therefore, to validate the $4.86, Britain insisted on inflating in a vainattempt to relieve the depression. Prices rose, the Bank of England lowered itsdiscount rate, and the balance of payment deficit and the resulting gold outflowbecame much worse. The pressure on the sterling intensified. Unwilling to stopinflating and tighten credit, Montagu Norman turned to Benjamin Strong, his oldally.Benjamin Strong purchased some sterling bills to reverse the dollar flow fromBritain and also sold France $60 million in gold to forestall French demands forredemption of sterling. But these were just temporary expedients. So Stronginvited three top central bankers for a highly secret conference in New York inJuly 1927. So secret was the conclave that Strong, in his usual high-handedfashion prevented Gates W. McGarrah, chairman of the board of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, from attending the meeting, and the Federal ReserveBoard in Washington was also kept in the dark.[64] [part0021.html#fn64] Inaddition to Norman, the other European representatives were Professor CharlesRist, deputy governor of the Bank of France, and Hjalmar Schacht, governor ofthe German Reichsbank. Strong and Norman tried hard to get Rist and Schacht toagree on a concerted and massive four-country cheap credit and inflation, butthe Europeans vigorously refused, expressing alarm at the inflationary trend.While Rist and Schacht sailed for home, the Anglo-American combine stayed toweld their pact for inflation, expanded credit, and lower interest rates. BeforeRist left, however, Strong told him buoyantly that he was “going to give alittle coup de whiskey to the stock market.”[65] [part0021.html#fn65]President Coolidge and Secretary Mellon endorsed the new inflationary policy,the only high-level objectors being Adolph Miller and Herbert Hoover. TheFederal Reserve authorities stayed silent about the reasons for their suddenexpansion in late 1927, with only Governor W.J. Bailey of the Kansas CityFederal Reserve Bank repeating the line that Strong had told him: that the cheapcredit policy—including the open-market purchases, the lowering of rediscountrates, and the lowering of Fed buying rates on acceptances—was being pursued to“help the farmers.” Helping Britain—not a very popular policy in the Americanheartland at the time—was kept under wraps as the major reason for theinflationary surge.[66] [part0021.html#fn66]The importance of helping Britain in the inflationary policy of the 1920s isseen in Benjamin Strong’s comments to Sir Arthur Salter, secretary of the Leagueof Nations and a Norman associate, in Paris in May 1928. Rejecting the idea of aformal meeting of the world’s central banks, Strong cited the politicalhostility in the United States. Then, as an aide summarized:> To illustrate how dangerous the position might become in the future as a> result of the decisions reached at the present time and how inflamed public or> political opinion might easily become when the results of past decision became> evident, Governor Strong cited the outcry against the speculative excesses now> being indulged in on the New York market and the criticism of the Federal> Reserve System for its failure to curb or prevent this speculation. He said> that very few people indeed realized that we were now paying the penalty for> the decision which was reached early in 1924 to help the rest of the world> back to a sound financial and monetary basis.[67] [part0021.html#fn67]9. CREATING THE ACCEPTANCE MARKETNowadays there are two methods by which the Federal Reserve can add to bankreserves and therefore to the inflating process of pyramiding new money on topof reserves as a base. One is open-market operations; the other is changing therediscount rate at which the Fed, as the lender of last resort, lends reservesto banks in trouble. But a third method was highly important in the 1920s: theintense subsidization—indeed, the very creation—of a market in acceptances.Discount policy was inflationary during the 1920s. In the first place, rateswere set below the market instead of a penalty rate above it, thus inducingbanks to borrow reserves from the Fed. Second, the Fed decided to lendcontinuously rather than only in emergencies. As the Federal Reserve Board wrotein its annual report of 1923:> The Federal Reserve banks are ... the source to which the member banks turn> when the demands of the business community have outrun their own unaided> resources. The Federal Reserve supplies the needed additions to credit in> times of business expansion and takes up the slack in times of business> recession.[68] [part0021.html#fn68]Presidents Harding and Coolidge repeatedly pledged to lower interest rates andto keep them low during the 1920s, and each did his best to fulfill that pledge.In 1922–23, 1925, and 1928, periods when the Federal Reserve was belatedlytrying to stop its inflationary policies, the discounting process, spurred byartificially low rediscount rates, came to the banks’ rescue.[69][part0021.html#fn69] During the onrushing stock market boom in 1927, PresidentCoolidge and Secretary Mellon stepped in whenever the boom showed signs offlagging and egged it on, predicting lower interest rates and urging higherprices. In one of these statements, Mellon assured the market that “there is anabundant supply of easy money which should take care of any contingencies thatmight arise.”[70] [part0021.html#fn70] Furthermore, both Harding and Coolidgeappointed Federal Reserve members who would implement the low discount rate, lowinterest rate policy.[71] [part0021.html#fn71]The most unusual aspect of the Federal Reserve-generated inflation of the 1920swas its creation and subsidization of the acceptance market in the UnitedStates. Commercial paper in the United States had always been confined tosingle-name promissory notes, often discounted at commercial banks. By contrast,in Europe and particularly in Britain, foreign trade (not domestic) washabitually financed by the mechanism of an endorsement of the debt, oracceptance. The acceptance bank endorsed and purchased the note and then sold itto a “dealer,” or bill broker, who in turn sold it to a commercial bank fordiscount.From the inception of the system, the Federal Reserve set out to bring athriving acceptance market into being by massive subsidization. Since there hadbeen virtually no naturally arising acceptance market in the United States, thedemand for acceptances by discount banks was extremely slight. The FederalReserve, therefore, undertook to buy all acceptances offered to it, either bythe member banks or by a tiny group of designated dealers, and to buy them at avery low, subsidized rate. Generally, this rate was lower than the discount ratefor similar commercial paper. In this way, the Federal Reserve provided reservesin a way unusually favorable to the banks. First, not only was the rate cheap,but acceptances were, like discounts and unlike open-market operations, alwaysthere to be provided by a passive Federal Reserve. And second, the acceptancesnever had to be repaid to the Fed and therefore, unlike discounts and likeopen-market purchases, they constituted a permanent addition to the reserves ofthe banks.[72] [part0021.html#fn72]The dominance of the Federal Reserve in making a market for acceptances can beseen in the proportion of acceptances held by the Fed. On June 30, 1927, over46% of bankers’ acceptances were held by the Federal Reserve, over 26% for itsown account and another 20% for foreign central banks.[73] [part0021.html#fn73]The subsidizing of acceptances was, from the early years, highly concentrated inNew York City. In the first place, the New York Fed seized control of theacceptance policy in 1922 and kept it for the remainder of the decade. Second,the bulk of acceptances were on foreign transactions, and all of thoseacceptances were purchased by the Fed from only nine very large acceptancedealers located in New York City. Third, the number of acceptance banks was alsoquite small: 118 in the entire country in 1932, of which 40 were located in NewYork City. And three-quarters of all acceptances were executed by banks in NewYork City. The acceptance banks were generally large commercial banks but alsoincluded the huge International Acceptance Bank of New York, the world’s largestacceptance bank, which in the 1930s merged with the Kuhn, Loeb-dominated Bank ofManhattan Company.[74] [part0021.html#fn74]Fed policy on acceptances played an inflationary role at crucial periods duringthe 1920s. In late 1922, this policy supplemented the role of discounts by farmore than offsetting the open-market sale of securities by the Fed. In the 1924credit expansion, almost twice as many acceptances as government securities werepurchased in the open market. And in the fateful 1927 inflationary surge,acceptances (“bills bought”) were equally as powerful in adding to reserves asthe Fed’s purchase of securities. Furthermore, during the latter half of 1928,when the Fed stopped buying securities in an attempt to get the runaway boomunder control, massive purchases of acceptances kept the boom going.Benjamin Strong was, of course, the man who instituted and maintained theFederal Reserve creation and subsidizing of the acceptance market. Indeed,Strong often took the lead in urging cheaper and cheaper rates to intensify thesubsidy. For Strong, this policy was vital for the promotion of foreign tradeand for facilitating international central bank collaboration and management ofthe world financial system.[75] [part0021.html#fn75]But by far the most enthusiastic and tireless advocate of ever greater FederalReserve aid to the acceptance market was Strong’s close friend Paul MoritzWarburg. From the very beginning of Warburg’s promotion of a central bank in1907, that bank’s subsidization of acceptance paper was crucial to his plan. Hescoffed at the prevalence of single-name promissory notes in the United States,a practice, he opined, that left the backward United States “at about the samepoint that had been reached by Europe at the time of the Medicis, and by Asia,in all likelihood, at the time of Hammurabi.” Warburg envisioned a money supplyissued by a central bank based on acceptance paper purchased by that bank.[76][part0021.html#fn76]We have seen that Paul Warburg was one of the most influential founders andshapers of the Federal Reserve System. He was on the board from 1914 to 1918,when he resigned because of his German ancestry, but he continued to be highlyinfluential through the 1920s as chairman of the Fed’s Federal Advisory Council.In January 1923, Warburg boasted before the American Acceptance Council, a tradeassociation of acceptance banks and dealers organized four years before, that hehad been largely responsible for the Fed’s acceptance-buying policy as well asfor the repeated statutory widening of eligibility for those purchases. In 1922,Warburg demanded still lower buying rates on acceptances, and in the spring of1929, when he began to worry about the developing boom, he still called for theFed to create a wider acceptance market.[77] [part0021.html#fn77]It is certainly plausible to hold that Warburg’s unremitting zeal for massiveFederal subsidy of the acceptance market, as well as its cartelization in thehands of a few New York acceptance bankers and dealers, was connected to hisstatus as a leading acceptance banker. For Paul Warburg was chairman of theboard of the world’s largest acceptance bank, the International Acceptance Bankof New York, from its inception in 1920. He also became a director of theimportant Westinghouse Acceptance Bank and of several other acceptance housesand was the chief founder and chairman of the executive committee of theAmerican Acceptance Council. His vaunting speech to that council in early 1923was his presidential address.[78] [part0021.html#fn78]10. FROM BOOM TO DEPRESSIONIn the spring of 1928, with Benjamin Strong ill and absent after mid-May, theFederal Reserve became alarmed by the now exploding stock market and tried toput an end to the inflationary boom. The Fed managed to contract reserves byselling securities, but its efforts were partially offset by large increases inrediscounting spurred by the Fed’s failure to raise rediscount ratessufficiently and by the banks’ shifting of credit from demand to time deposits,which required far less reserves. Still, the contraction of reserves took holdfrom May through July, and as a result, the rate of money growth leveled offsharply.[79] [part0021.html#fn79] Stock prices rose far more slowly than before,and the gold drain out of the United States began to reverse.The boom could have ended in mid-1928, and the resulting contraction could havebeen mild. But this was not to be. Instead, the Fed’s massive purchases ofacceptances increased reserves in the latter half of the year, and the moneysupply growth rose again. One reason for the Fed’s failure to stay itsrelatively less inflationary course was the great pressure it received fromEurope. The short-run “benefits” of the inflationary injection of 1927 in Europehad already dissipated: The pound was sagging again, gold was flowing out ofBritain, and interest rates were again higher in the United States than inBritain. With the exception of France, Europe clamored against any tighter moneyin the United States, and the Fed’s aggravation of inflation in late 1928 easedthe flow of gold from Britain.[80] [part0021.html#fn80] And Benjamin Strong,though ill and traveling in Europe, kept up a stream of pressure for easiermoney. In mid-July, Strong looked back on his handiwork and found it good. In aletter to S. Parker Gilbert, he wrote that his policy since 1924 had> enabled monetary reorganization to be completed in Europe, which otherwise> would have been impossible. It was undertaken with the well recognized hazard> that we were liable to encounter a big speculation and some expansion of> credit. ... Six months ago we faced the new year with practically all the> European nations in a strong position in monetary matters. ... Our course was> perfectly obvious. We had to undertake it. The conditions permitted it, and> the possibility of damage resulting abroad were [sic] at a minimum.[81]> [part0021.html#fn81]Strong went on to express his concern at the “very high rates” then prevailingin New York and looked forward to rate reductions in the fall. On his return tothe United States in August, Strong continued to express concern, not over theinflationary boom and the runaway stock market but over what he consideredexcessively high interest rates. He clearly wished to resume his oldinflationary policy.After Strong’s retirement in August, his faithful followers tried to tread thesame path. His successor as governor, George L. Harrison, led the Open MarketCommittee to worry about excessively high rates and asked and obtained theboard’s permission for the authority to engage in massive open-market purchases.The end of Strong’s reign (he died in October 1928) led to indecisive splits andfragmented power within the Federal Reserve System. Although Harrison attemptedto emphasize open-market purchases, the majority of the board wanted the Fed tobuy far more acceptances. Each faction wanted its own version of inflationarycredit expansion.One reason for the Fed’s emphasis on acceptances was the increasing adoption inWashington of the curious theory of “moral suasion,” which was to plague effortsto end the inflationary boom during the latter half of 1928 and through 1929.Until the end, President Coolidge was still trying to boost the stock market.But the new President Hoover and Governor Roy Young of the Federal Reserve Boardhad a different theory: that credit could remain cheap and easy for “legitimate”business but be restrictive toward the stock market. As soon as Hoover assumedoffice, he tried moral suasion by intimidation, sending an old banker friend,Henry M. Robinson of Los Angeles, to New York to try to persuade the banks torestrict stock loans and calling a meeting of editors and publishers to warnthem of high stock prices.[82] [part0021.html#fn82] Moral suasion was abandonedby June 1929. The Federal Reserve, after finally shutting off the acceptancewindow in March by raising its buying rate above the discount rate, delayedraising the rediscount rate under pressure from Hoover. Finally, it raised therate in August, but typically the Fed offset this check to the boom by loweringthe acceptance rate at the same time. As a result of this unprecedented“straddle,” large Fed purchases of acceptances from July to October drove thestock market to new heights. These acceptances were largely sterling billspurchased by the New York Fed once again to help Britain. Great Britain wastrying to inflate and pursue cheap credit in the midst of a worseningdepression, and the Fed was trying to stem the renewed outflow of gold in theUnited States.[83] [part0021.html#fn83]With all eyes on the stock market, however, the great American boom of the 1920swas already over. For despite, or perhaps because of, the waffling and confusionof the Fed, the money supply remained level from the peak at the end of 1928through September 1929. A recession was now inevitable.Unbeknownst to most Americans, the economy started turning downward around July1929. Three months later, on October 24, the great stock market crash broughtthe shift from boom to depression to the attention of everyone.The Federal Reserve did not meet the crash with any idea of laissez-faire or ofallowing the economy to liquidate the malinvestments of the boom. On thecontrary, its inflationist attitude during the boom was matched by a similar andeven more aggravated outlook during the depression. In an unprecedented act, theFed inflated reserves wildly in one week—the week of the crash. In the last weekof October, the Fed doubled its holdings of government securities and discounted$200 million for member banks, adding $350 million to total bank reserves.Almost all of these increased reserves were poured into New York in order toprevent liquidation of the stock market and to induce New York City banks totake over the brokers’ loans that nonbank lenders were in the process ofunloading. As a result, member banks expanded their deposits during that fatefullast week in October by $1.8 billion—a monetary expansion of nearly 10% in oneweek. Almost all of this amount, totaling $1.6 billion, came from increaseddeposits in New York City banks. The Federal Reserve at the same time sharplylowered its rediscount and acceptance rates.By mid-November, the great stock market break was over and, stimulated byartificial credit, began to rise again. Total bank reserves then fell, so thatat the end of November they had reached precrash levels. This contractionstemmed from a decline in discounts and acceptances, a gold outflow, andincreased money in circulation; the Fed tried to offset this in vain bypurchasing more securities. If we compare October 23, the day before the crash,with the situation at the end of 1929, we find that bank reserves controlled bythe Fed—all government securities—tripled in size. This expansion was offset bysuch uncontrolled factors affecting reserves as a decline in gold and anincrease in cash in circulation brought on by falling public confidence in thebanks and in the dollar itself. The Fed had done its best to inflate in the lastquarter of 1929, but its efforts were thwarted by seasonal cash outflows and theexigencies of the gold standard. The result was that the total money supplyremained level in the final quarter of 1929.President Hoover was proud of his experiment in cheap money and, in a speech toa White House conference of several hundred business leaders in December, hailedthe nation’s good fortune in possessing the magnificent Federal Reserve System,which had succeeded in saving banks, restoring confidence, and lowering interestrates. Hoover also revealed that he had done his part for the cause bypersonally urging the banks to rediscount more extensively at the FederalReserve. Secretary of the Treasury Mellon issued one of his by now traditionallyoptimistic pronouncements, stating that there was “plenty of credit available.”And William Green, head of the American Federation of Labor, hailed the FederalReserve for its success in ending the depression. On November 22, 1929, Greenopined: “All the factors which make for a quick and speedy industrial andeconomic recovery are present and evident. The Federal Reserve System isoperating, serving as a barrier against financial demoralization. Within a fewmonths, industrial conditions will become normal, confidence and stabilizationof industry and finance will be restored.”[84] [part0021.html#fn84]Apparently, many leading Federal Reserve officials were disposed, at the end of1929, to “let the money market ‘sweat it out’ and reach monetary ease by thewholesome process of liquidation.”[85] [part0021.html#fn85] But thislaissez-faire policy was not to be. Instead, Governor George L. Harrison, headof the New York Fed, led a policy of massive easy money. Rediscount rates at theFed, buying rates on acceptances, and the call loan rate all fell drastically.At the end of August 1930, Governor Roy Young of the Federal Reserve Boardresigned and was replaced by a thoroughgoing inflationist, Eugene Meyer, Jr.[86][part0021.html#fn86] Total bank reserves rose during the year, chiefly throughlarge Fed purchases of government securities. But all this inflationism was tono avail, since a wave of bank failures struck toward the end of the year, andshaky banks had to contract their operations. The net result was that the totalmoney supply remained level throughout the year. For a while stock prices roseagain, but they soon fell sharply, and production and employment kept fallingsteadily.Meanwhile, the New York Fed continued to lead collaborations with foreigncentral banks, often against the wishes of the federal administration. Thus, thenew “‘central bankers’ bank,” the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), wasinstigated by Montagu Norman, and much of the American capital for the BIS wasput up by J.P. Morgan & Co. The BIS treated the New York Fed as America’scentral bank, and Governor Harrison made a trip abroad in late 1930 to conferwith European central bankers. Chairman of the BIS’s first organizing committeewas Jackson E. Reynolds, a director of the New York Fed, and the first presidentof the BIS was Gates W. McGarrah, who resigned as chairman of the board of theNew York Fed to assume the post. Yet there was no legislative sanction for U.S.participation in the bank.Despite the administration’s and the Fed’s systemic attempts to inflate andprovide cheap money, the inflationists were not satisfied with the course ofevents. In late October, Business Week thundered against the supposed“deflationists in the saddle,” supposedly inspired by the large commercial andinvestment banks.[87] [part0021.html#fn87]In contrast, in the same month Herbert Hoover apparently felt that the time hadcome for self-congratulation. In an address to the American Bankers Association,he summed up the multifaceted intervention of the preceding year. He hailed theFederal Reserve System as the great instrument of promoting stability and calledfor an “ample supply of credit at low interest,” which he pointed out was nowavailable “through the cooperation of the banks and the Federal Reserve system.”Hoover proceeded to point out that the Federal Reserve was the locus of a vastsystem of cartelization:> The reserve system and its member banks and the Treasury participation in fact> form a widespread cooperative organization, acting in the broad interest of> the whole people. To a large degree it can influence the flow of credit.> Bankers themselves are represented at each stage of management. And, in> addition, the various boards and advisory committees represent also industry,> agriculture, merchandising, and the Government. The reserve system therefore> furnished an admirable center for cooperation of the banking business with the> production and distribution industries and the Government in the development> of broad and detached policies of business stability.[88] [part0021.html#fn88]Moreover, these broad and detached policies of cooperation had succeeded incombating the depression:> We have all been much engaged with measures of relief from the effect of the> collapse of a year ago. At that time I determined that it was my duty, even> without precedent, to call upon the business of the country for coordinated> and constructive action to resist the forces of disintegration.

Our> bankers and the reserve system have carried the country through the credit> storm without impairment.[89] [part0021.html#fn89]The rest is history.11. SUMMARYThe bleak record of accelerating inflation and recession since the inception ofthe Federal Reserve in 1913 may be seen in a different light if we reevaluatethe purpose that this central bank was intended to serve. For the FederalReserve was designed not to curb the allegedly inflationary tendencies of freelycompeting banks but to do precisely the opposite: to enable the banks to inflateuniformly without worrying about calls for redemption by noninflatingcompetitors. In short, the Federal Reserve was designed to act as agovernment-sponsored and -enforced cartel promoting the income of banks bypreventing free competition from doing its constructive work on behalf of theconsumer. The Federal Reserve emerged in an era when federal and stategovernments were embarked on precisely this kind of program in many sectors ofindustry, and it was designed to do for the banks what the ICC had done for therailroads, the Agriculture Department for the farmers, and the FTC for generalindustry. These actions of the Progressive era came after widespread attempts,in the late 1890s and earlier, to cartelize or create monopolies voluntarily,attempts that almost all came to swift and resounding failure. Various largebusiness groupings, therefore, came to the conclusion that government would haveto play an active and enforcing role if cartelization was to succeed.This chapter demonstrates the unhappiness of particularly the large Wall Streetbanks with the “inelasticity” of the pre-Federal Reserve banking system, thatis, its inability to create more money and credit. They were unhappy also withthe growing decentralization of the nation’s banking by the early part of the20th century. After the failure of attempts by McKinley and Roosevelt’ssecretaries of the treasury to engage in central banking, and particularly afterthe Panic of 1907, large banking and financial groups, in particular those ofMorgan, Rockefeller, and Kuhn-Loeb, began a drive to establish a central bank inthe United States. Despite minor political disagreements, the numerous variantsof Federal Reserve proposals, from the Aldrich plan to the final bill in 1913,were essentially the same.The structure of the Federal Reserve Act was cartelizing and inflationary, andthe personnel of the Federal Reserve Board reflected the dominance of the largebanking groups, particularly the Morgans, in the drive for a central bank. Theruling force in the Federal Reserve System from its inception until his death in1928 was Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whoall his life had been firmly in the Morgan ambit.Strong’s policies were what one might expect. His willingness to inflate moneyand credit to purchase government deficits was critical to financing America’sentry into World War I. He also moved quickly to internationalize the bankingcartel by forming a close tie with the Bank of England, of which the Morgan Bankwas fiscal agent. The Morgans were also closely connected with munitions andother war-related exports to Britain and France, and enjoyed the sole privilegeof underwriting British and French war bonds in the United States.Benjamin Strong was obliged to inflate money and credit during the 1920s inorder to help Britain return to an inflationary form of the gold standard at ahighly overvalued pound. Only by Strong’s increasing the supply of dollars couldhis close collaborator, Montagu Norman, head of the Bank of England, hope tostem the flow of gold from Britain to the United States. Strong performed thisinflationary role not only by keeping rediscount rates below the market andbuying treasury securities on the open market but also by subsidizing—indeed,virtually creating—a market in bankers’ acceptances, which the Fed stood readyto buy in any amount offered at artificially cheap rates. This acceptancepolicy, designed to promote foreign trade (especially in London), was adoptedunder the influence of one of the founders of the Federal Reserve, Paul M.Warburg of Kuhn-Loeb & Co. who also became the nation’s largest acceptancebanker.When the stock market crash hit, the Federal Reserve and the Hooveradministration were scarcely ready to allow free-market processes to bring aboutrecovery. Instead, the Fed, backed strongly by Hoover, inflated reserves wildly,and interest rates fell sharply—all, of course, to no avail.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in Money in Crisis: The Federal Reserve, the Economy, andMonetary Reform, Barry N. Siegel, ed. (San Francisco, CA: Pacific Institute forPublic Policy Research, 1984), pp. 89–136.[Editor’s footnote] It is important to keep in mind that a “bank cartel” isdifferent than a traditional cartel. A traditional cartel restricts output andraises prices. The goal of a bank cartel, on the other hand, is not to restrictcredit expansion and raise interest rates, but for banks to engage in creditexpansion in unison and lower interest rates, and to maintain this by notcalling on other banks’ notes and deposits. Just like traditional cartels on thefree market fail, bank cartels also fail because of internal and externalpressure as banks inside the cartel are faced with the irresistible temptationto call on others’ notes and deposits, and the notes and deposits eventuallywind up in other banks outside of the cartel (including foreign banks). SeeMises, Human Action, pp. 441–45; Murray Rothbard, The Mystery of Banking(Auburn, AL: Mises Institute, 2008 [1983]), pp. 111–24.On the other hand, government can stabilize bank cartels either by restrictingentry to stifle the redemption mechanism, or by providing new sources ofreserves. The Federal Reserve promoted general monetary expansion, and alsoempowered New York City banks by increasing their interbank deposits relative toother central reserve cities through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’sliberal discount window policies, and by injecting new reserves there first asthey led the monetary expansion in the 1920s. Moreover, the Fed personnel washeavily dominated by banking interests. In addition to this chapter, see GeorgeSelgin, “New York’s Bank: The National Monetary Commission and the Founding ofthe Fed,” Cato Institute Policy Analysis (June, 2016): 1–38.[1] [part0021.html#ft1] Kolko, The Triumph of Conservatism, p. 274.[2] [part0021.html#ft2] In contrast, notes of more solid banks circulated atpar, even at great distances.[3] [part0021.html#ft3] See Milton Friedman and Anna Jacob Schwartz, A MonetaryHistory of the United States, 1867–1960 (Princeton, NJ: National Bureau ofEconomic Research, 1963), pp. 168–70. Friedman and Schwartz grant validity tothe complaints of inelasticity in at least one sense: that deposits and noteswere not easily interconvertible without causing grave problems. If bank clientswished to redeem bank deposits for bank notes, the fractional reserverequirements for deposits but not for notes meant that such simple redemptionhad a multiple contractionist effect on the supply of money and vice versa,since the exchange of notes for deposits had an expansionist effect. Friedmanand Schwartz conclude that this defect justified various centralizing remedies.They fail to point out another alternative: a return to the decentralizedbanking of pre-Civil War days, which did not suffer from such problems ofinterconvertibility.One curiosity of the national banking system is that the notes issued by thenational banks were rigidly linked by law to the total holdings of federalgovernment bonds by each bank. This provision, a holdover from various statebank systems imposed by the Whigs before the Civil War, was designed to tie thebanks to state deficits and the public debt. See Ron Paul and Lewis Lehrman, TheCase for Gold: A Minority Report of the U.S. Gold Commission (Washington, D.C.:Cato Institute, 1982), p. 67. The source of “inelasticity,” however, couldeasily have been remedied by abolishing this link without imposing a centralbank. Many of the early bank reforms proposed during the 1890s aimed to do justthat. See Robert Craig West, Banking Reform and the Federal Reserve, 1863–1923(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1977), pp. 42ff.[4] [part0021.html#ft4] U.S. Department of Commerce, Historical Statistics ofthe United States, Colonial Times to 1957, pp. 626–29.[5] [part0021.html#ft5] Quoted in Kolko, Triumph of Conservatism, p. 141.[6] [part0021.html#ft6] See Kolko, Triumph of Conservatism, p. 141; and LesterV. Chandler, Benjamin Strong, Central Banker (Washington, D.C.: BrookingsInstitution, 1958), pp. 25–26.[7] [part0021.html#ft7] The major pressure group calling for “progressive”cartelization was the National Civic Federation (NCF), founded in 1900, anorganized coalition of big business and intellectual-technocrat groups as wellas a few corporatist labor union leaders. On the importance of the NCF, seeWeinstein, The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State. See also Eakins, “TheDevelopment of Corporate Liberal Policy Research in the United States,” pp.53–82.In the past two decades, a massive literature has developed on the ProgressiveEra from both a cartelizing and a technocratic power-seeking perspective. Thebest treatments are in Kolko, Triumph of Conservatism; Weinstein, CorporateIdeal in the Liberal State; and Gilbert, Designing the Industrial State.

Investment banking houses were—and still are—partnerships rather thancorporations, and Morgan activities in politics as well as industrial mergerswere conducted by Morgan partners. Particularly conspicuous Morgan partners inboth fields were George W. Perkins, Thomas W. Lamont, Henry P. Davison, DwightMorrow, and Willard Straight.[17] [part0021.html#ft17] Or at least partially emigrated. Warburg spent half ofeach year in Germany, serving as a financial liaison between the two greatbanks, if not between the two countries themselves. Warburg was related to JacobH. Schiff by marriage. Schiff was a son-in-law of Solomon Loeb, a co-founder ofKuhn, Loeb & Co., and Warburg, husband of Nina Loeb, was another son-in-law ofSolomon’s by a second wife. The incestuous circle was completed when Schiff’sdaughter Frieda married another partner, Warburg’s brother Felix, which in asense made Paul his brother’s uncle.

It only muddles the issue to call every supply-sideprice rise (say, due to a coffee blight or an OPEC cartel) “inflationary.”[31] [part0021.html#ft31] A banker’s institution of far less importance is theFederal Advisory Council, composed of bankers selected by the board of directorsof their district Bank. The council’s recommendations garner considerablepublicity, but it has no power within the system.[32] [part0021.html#ft32] C.A. Phillips, T.F. McManus, and R.W.

This in effect is equivalent to increasing thesupply of reserve money.” It is indeed, provided that money’s “work” is to be asinflationary as possible and “efficiency” means producing as much inflation asrapidly as possible.

It is worth quoting his analysis infull:> The House of Morgan was hip-deep in the Allied cause from 1914 on ... Morgan’s> railroads were in increasingly grave financial trouble, and 1914 saw the> collapse of Morgan’s $400 million New Haven Railroad. Concentrating on> railroads and a bit laggard in moving into industrial finance, Morgan had seen> its dominance in investment banking slip since the turn of the century. Now,> World War I had come as a godsend to Morgan’s fortunes, and Morgan prosperity> was intimately wrapped up in the Allied cause.> > It is no wonder that Morgan partners took the lead in whipping up pro-British> and French propaganda in the United States; and to clamor for the U.S. to> enter the war on the Allied side. Henry P. Davison set up the Aerial Coast> Patrol in 1915, and Willard D. Straight and Robert Bacon, both Morgan> partners, took the lead in organizing the Businessman’s Training Camp at> Plattsburgh, New York, to urge universal conscription. Elihu Root and Morgan> [Jr.] himself were particularly active in pressing for entering the war on the> Allied side. Furthermore, President Wilson was surrounded by Morgan people.> His son-in-law, Secretary of the Treasury, William G. McAdoo, had been rescued> from financial bankruptcy by Morgan. Colonel Edward M. House, Wilson’s> mysterious and powerful foreign policy adviser, was connected with Morgan> railroads in Texas.

See also Rothbard, Wall Street,Banks, and American Foreign Policy, pp. 17–23. The war purchases for Britain andFrance totaled $3 billion, and the House of Morgan earned a commission of $30million. Moreover, the Morgans were able to steer British and French warcontracts to Morgan affiliated firms, including General Electric and U.S. Steel.See Murray Rothbard, “The Gold Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years,” in AHistory of Money and Banking in the United States, Joseph Salerno, ed.

Coolidge first offered the Secretary of State position to Morganattorney Elihu Root, but after he declined, settled for Frank B. Kellogg, whohad Morgan connections, along with his assistant secretary Joseph C. Grew.Dwight Morrow and Henry L. Stimson, a disciple of Root, were also involved ininternational relations with Mexico and Nicaragua. Secretary of the Treasury wasAndrew C. Mellon, who was generally allied to the Morgan interests. Morganinfluence continued in the Hoover administration, and Dwight Morrow served as animportant unofficial advisor to Herbert Hoover.

HERBERT HOOVER AS SECRETARY OF COMMERCEThe conventional wisdom, of historian and layman alike, pictures Herbert Hooveras the last stubborn guardian of laissez-faire in America. The laissez-faireeconomy, so this wisdom runs, produced the Great Depression in 1929, andHoover’s traditional, do-nothing policies could not stem the tide. Hence, Hooverand his hidebound policies were swept away, and Franklin Roosevelt entered tobring to America a New Deal, a new progressive economy of state regulation andintervention fit for the modern age.The major theme of this chapter is that this conventional historical view ispure mythology and that the facts are virtually the reverse: that HerbertHoover, far from being an advocate of laissez-faire, was in every way theprecursor of Roosevelt and the New Deal, that, in short, he was one of the majorleaders of the 20th-century shift from relatively laissez-faire capitalism tothe modern corporate state. In the terminology of William A. Williams and theNew Left, Hoover was a preeminent “corporate liberal.”When Herbert Hoover returned to the United States in late 1919, fresh from hispost as Relief Administrator in Europe, he came armed with a suggested“Reconstruction Program” for America. The program sketched the outlines of acorporate state; there was to be national planning through “voluntary”cooperation among businesses and groups under “central direction.”[1][part0022.html#fn1] The Federal Reserve System was to allocate capital toessential industries and thereby eliminate the industrial “waste” of freemarkets. Hoover’s plan also included the creation of public dams, theimprovement of waterways, a federal home-loan banking system, the promotion ofunions and collective bargaining, and governmental regulation of the stockmarket to eliminate “vicious speculation.”[2] [part0022.html#fn2] It is nowonder that Progressive Republicans as well as such Progressive Democrats asLouis Brandeis, Herbert Croly, and others on the New Republic, Edward A. Filene,Colonel Edward M. House, and Franklin D. Roosevelt boomed Hoover for thepresidency during the 1920 campaign.Hoover was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Harding under pressureby the Progressive wing of the party, and accepted under the condition that hewould be consulted on all the economic activities of the federal government. Hethereupon set out deliberately to “reconstruct America.”[3] [part0022.html#fn3]Hoover was only thwarted from breaking the firm American tradition oflaissez-faire during a depression by the fact that the severe but short-liveddepression of 1920–21 was over soon after he took office. He also faced somereluctance on the part of Harding and the Cabinet. As it was, however, Hooverorganized a federal committee on unemployment, which supplied unemploymentrelief through branches and subbranches to every state, and in numerous citiesand local communities. Furthermore, Hoover organized the various federal, state,and municipal governments to increase public works, and persuaded the biggestbusiness firms, such as Standard Oil of New Jersey and United States Steel, toincrease their expenditure on repairs and construction. He also persuadedemployers to spread unemployment by cutting hours for all workers instead ofdischarging the marginal workers—an action he was to repeat in the 1929Depression.[4] [part0022.html#fn4]Hoover called for these interventionist measures with an analogy from theinstitutions of wartime planning and collaboration, urging that Americansdevelop “the same spirit of spontaneous cooperation in every community forreconstruction that we had in war.”[5] [part0022.html#fn5]An important harbinger for Hoover’s later Depression policies was thepresident’s Conference on Unemployment, a gathering of eminent leaders ofindustry, banking, and labor called by President Harding in the fall of 1921 atthe instigation of Hoover. In contrast to Harding’s address affirminglaissez-faire as the proper method of dealing with depressions, Hoover’s openingaddress to the Conference called for active intervention.[6] [part0022.html#fn6]Furthermore, the Conference’s major recommendation—for coordinated federal stateexpansion of public works to remedy depressions—was prepared by Hoover and hisstaff in advance of the conference.[7] [part0022.html#fn7] Of particularimportance was the provision that public works and public relief were to besupplied only at the usual wage rate—a method of trying to maintain the highwage rates of the preceding boom during a depression.Although these interventions did not have time to take hold in the 1921depression, a precedent for federal intervention in an economic depression hadnow been set, as one of Hoover’s admiring biographers writes, “rather to thehorror of conservatives.”[8] [part0022.html#fn8]The president’s Conference established three permanent research committees,headed overall by Hoover, which continued during the 1920s to publish studiesadvocating public-works stabilization during depressions. One such book,Seasonal Operations in the Construction Industry (Washington, D.C.: Conferenceon Unemployment, 1921), the foreword to which was written by Hoover, urgedseasonal stabilization of construction. This study was in part the result of aperiod of propaganda emitted by the American Construction Council, a tradeassociation for the construction industry, which of course was enthusiasticabout large-scale programs of government contracts for the constructionindustry. This Council was founded jointly by Herbert Hoover and Franklin D.Roosevelt in the summer of 1922, with the aim of stabilizing and cartelizing theindustry, and of planning the entire construction industry through theimposition of various codes of “ethics” and of “fair practice.” The codes werethe particular idea of Herbert Hoover. Following the path of all would-becartelists who are hostile to no one more than the individualistic competitor,Franklin D. Roosevelt, president of the American Construction Council, tookrepeated opportunity to denounce rugged individualism and profit-seeking byindividuals.[9] [part0022.html#fn9]Throughout the 1920s Hoover supported numerous bills in Congress forpublic-works programs during depressions. He was backed in these endeavors bythe American Federation of Labor, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and theAmerican Engineering Council, of which Hoover was for a time president. It wasclear that the engineering profession would also benefit greatly from governmentsubsidization of the construction industry. By the middle twenties, PresidentCoolidge, Secretary Mellon, and the National Democratic Party had been convertedto the scheme, but Congress was not yet convinced.After he was elected president, but before taking office, Hoover allowed hispublic-works plan (the “Hoover Plan”) to be presented to the Conference ofGovernors in late 1928 by Governor Ralph Owen Brewster of Maine. Brewster calledthe plan the “Road to Plenty,” a name that Hoover had taken from Foster andCatchings,[10] [part0022.html#fn10] the popular co-authors of a plan for massiveinflation and public works as the way to end depressions. Although seven oreight governors were enthusiastic about the plan, the Governors’ Conferencetabled the scheme. A large part of the press hailed the plan extravagantly as a“pact to outlaw depression.” Leading the applause was William Green, head of theAF of L, who hailed the plan as the most important announcement on wages andemployment in a decade, and John P. Frey of the AF of L who announced thatHoover had accepted the AF of L theory that depressions are caused by low wages.The press reported that “labor is jubilant” because the new president’s remedyfor unemployment is “identical with that of labor.”The close connection between Hoover and the labor leadership was no isolatedphenomenon. Hoover had long agitated for industry to encourage and incorporatelabor unionism within the framework of the emerging industrial order. Moreover,he played a crucial role in converting the labor leaders themselves to the ideaof a corporate state with unions as junior partners in the system, a state thatwould organize and harmonize labor and capital.Hoover’s pro-union views first achieved prominence when, as chairman ofPresident Wilson’s Second Industrial Conference (1919/20), he guided thisconference of corporate-liberal industrialists and labor leaders to criticize“company unionism” and to urge the expansion of collective bargaining,government arbitration boards for labor disputes, and a program of nationalhealth and old-age insurance. Soon afterward Hoover arranged a meeting ofleading industrialists with “advanced views” in an unsuccessful attempt topersuade them to “establish liaison” with the AF of L. In January, 1921, the AFof L journal published a significant address by Hoover, which called for the“definite organization of great national associations” of economic groups andtheir mutual cooperation. This cooperation would serve to promote efficiency andmitigate labor-management conflict. Above all, workers would be protected from“the unfair competition of the sweatshop.” Still more did this mean “protection”of the lower-cost large employers from the competition of their smaller“sweatshop” rivals—a typical instance of monopolizers using humanitarianrhetoric to gain public support for the restriction and suppression ofcompetition. Hoover went so far in this address as to support the closed shop,provided that the closure was to be for the sake of unity of purpose in aidingthe employer to increase production and to mold a cooperative labor force. Inconclusion, Hoover called for a new economic system, what was in effect acorporate state, that would provide an alternative to old-fashionedlaissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and Marxian socialism on the other.[11][part0022.html#fn11]In an authoritative study, William English Walling, an intimate of SamuelGompers, wrote of the crucial influence of Hoover’s theories upon Gompers andthe AF of L, especially from 1920 on. This influence was particularly strong inpersuading the labor leaders to endorse the idea of organizing all the largeoccupation groups and then effecting their mutual harmony and cooperation underthe aegis and control of the federal government. Capital and labor in eachindustry, organized in collaboration, were to have the role of government ofthat particular industry.[12] [part0022.html#fn12] It was indeed appropriate forthe French politician Edouard Herriot to praise Hoover in 1920 for his idea offusing the “economic trinity” of labor, capital, and government into one system,thus putting an end to the class struggle.[13] [part0022.html#fn13]Another reason for Hoover’s pro-union attitude was that he had adopted theincreasingly popular thesis that high wage rates were a major cause ofprosperity. It then followed that wage rates must not be lowered duringdepressions. In contrast to all prior depressions, including 1920–21, when wagerates were cut sharply, wage-cutting was considered by Hoover to beimpermissible and as leading to a failure in purchasing power and theperpetuation of depression. These views were to prove a fateful harbinger of thepolicies used during the Great Depression.One of Hoover’s most important labor interventions during the 1920s came in thesteel industry. He persuaded Harding to hold a conference of steel manufacturersin May, 1922, after which he and Harding called upon the steel magnates to bowto the workers’ demand to shift from a 12-hour to an eight-hour day. In doingso, Hoover was siding with the liberal wing of the steel industry, led byCharles R. Hook and Alexander Legge, whose plants had already instituted theshorter workday, and who of course were anxious to impose higher costs on theirlagging competitors. When Judge Gary of United States Steel and other leadingsteelmen refused to go along, Hoover acted to mobilize public opinion againstthem. Thus, he induced the national engineering societies to endorse theeight-hour day, and himself wrote the introduction to the endorsement. Finally,Hoover wrote a stern letter of rebuke for President Harding, which Harding sentto Gary on June 18, 1923, forcing Gary to capitulate.Herbert Hoover also played a leading role in collectivizing labor relations inthe railroad industry, thereby cartelizing that industry still further thanbefore and incorporating railway unions within the cartel framework. Afterrepeated and largely unsuccessful interventions to try to gain pro-unionconcessions during the railroad strike of 1922, Hoover became a majorauthor—along with union lawyers Donald Richberg and David E. Lilienthal—of theRailway Labor Act of 1926, by which the railway unions got themselvesestablished in the industry. The ancestor of the New Deal’s Wagner Act, theRailway Labor Act, imposed collective bargaining upon the industry; in return,the unions agreed to give up the strike weapon. The great majority of therailroads warmly supported this new departure in American labor relations.[14][part0022.html#fn14]In a major address before the United States Chamber of Commerce, on May 7, 1924,Hoover spelled out his corporatist views in some detail. He called for theself-regulation of industry by way of trade associations, farm groups, andunions. In a vein strongly reminiscent of English Guild Socialism, Hoover harkedback to the Middle Ages for his model: the guilds, he asserted, obtained “morestability through collective action.” The job of the associations was tostrengthen “ethical standards” in industry by eliminating “waste” and“destructive competition.” In short, Hoover was calling for the nationalcartelization of industry under the aegis of government.[15][part0022.html#fn15] Samuel Gompers hailed the address and considered this “neweconomic policy” to be the same as the newly forged position of the AF of L.[16][part0022.html#fn16]Herbert Hoover’s entire program of activities as Secretary of Commerce wasdesigned to advance the subsidization of industry and the interpenetration ofgovernment and business. As Hoover’s admirer and former head of the UnitedStates Chamber of Commerce put it, Hoover had advanced the “teamplay ofgovernment with the leaders of character in the various industries.”[17][part0022.html#fn17] Thus, Hoover expanded the Bureau of Foreign and DomesticCommerce fivefold, opening numerous offices at home and abroad. His tradecommissioners and attachés aided American exports in numerous ways. He alsoreorganized the Bureau along commodity lines, with each commodity divisionheaded by someone chosen by the particular trade or industry, from the trade “heknows and represents.”[18] [part0022.html#fn18] Furthermore, Hoover promoted thecartelization of each industry by inducing each trade to create a committee tocooperate with the Department of Commerce, and to select the industry’s choicefor head of the commodity division. Officials in the Department weresystematically recruited from business to stay in the Department for a few yearsand then to return to private business at higher-paying jobs.One favorite method of Hoover’s for subsidizing as well as cartelizing exportswas to foster the creation of export-trade associations. Thus, in 1926, Hooverrepeatedly urged the coffee trade to band together and create a National CoffeeCouncil, so that all American coffee buyers could join together to lower buyingprices. Hoover and his aides craftily suggested to the coffee trade that oneunion leader and one woman consumer be named to the proposed Coffee Council as apublic-relations device to relieve public fears of a cartel.[19][part0022.html#fn19]The difficulties of forming a coffee cartel proved insurmountable; but Hooverhad more luck with the rubber industry, organizing it to fight British cartelrestrictions on Asian rubber production that had been imposed in 1922. Hooverled the rubber industry in a drive to induce Americans to buy less rubber andhence to lower the price, as well as to promote American-owned sources ofsupply, by such means as government subsidies to new United States-owned rubberplantations in the Philippines.[20] [part0022.html#fn20] An Americanrubber-buying pool was established in 1926 and lasted until the end of Britishrestrictions two years later.[21] [part0022.html#fn21]As soon as he assumed office, Hoover induced President Harding to pressureinvestment bankers to require that the proceeds of their loans abroad be used topurchase American exports. When little came of this pressure, Hoover began tothreaten congressional action if the banks did not agree. For Hoover, the aim ofsubsidizing exports was so important that even unsound foreign loans that couldserve this purpose were considered worthwhile.[22] [part0022.html#fn22]Hoover’s opposition to foreign “monopoly” did not of course prevent him fromsupporting a protective tariff in the United States, thus providing privilege toAmerican domestic as well as export firms. During the 1920s, Hoover was alsoactive in promoting the cartelization of the domestic oil industry. As an activemember of President Coolidge’s Federal Oil Conservation Board since itsinception in 1924, Hoover worked in collaboration with a growing majority of theoil industry in behalf of restrictions on oil production in the name of“conservation.” This was a “conservation,” by the way, that was urged regardlessof whether American oil resources seemed to be scarce or superabundant. Hooverwas particularly interested in removing antitrust limitations on industrialcooperation in such restrictive measures.[23] [part0022.html#fn23]In the field of coal, Hoover sponsored repeated attempts at cartelization. Thefirst attempt was a bill in 1921 to establish a federal coal commission togather and publish statistics of the coal industry, so as to publicize pricedata and thereby facilitate industry-wide price-fixing. Failing a commission,the Department of Commerce was eager to take on the task. However, this and alater scheme by Hoover to encourage marketing cooperatives in coal by exemptionfrom antitrust laws, were defeated by the opposition of competitive low-costSouthern coal operators. Undaunted, Hoover, in 1922, prepared a full-fledgedcartelizing plan. The idea was to establish unemployment insurance in the coalindustry, so designed as to penalize in the cost of the plan the part-time andseasonal coal mines, and thereby to drive these higher-cost mines out ofbusiness. The coal industry would then form cooperatives, which would fix andallocate quotas on production, putting more mines out of operation, the ownersto be compensated out of the increased cartel profits made by the rest of theindustry. The district coal cooperatives were to market all the coal and thendivide the revenues proportionately. But once again Hoover could not command theneeded support from the coal industry and the public.[24] [part0022.html#fn24]Hoover played a similar role in cartelizing the cotton textile industry.Favoring the “open-price” plan for stimulating price agreements, Hoover used hisDepartment of Commerce to provide the price publicity that might be illegal fora trade association. Hoover also played a role in forcing the cotton textileindustry to establish a nationwide rather than a regional trade association, tothe delight of the bulk of the industry. Hoover repeatedly urged the manyreluctant firms to join this Cotton Textile Institute, which gave promise ofstabilizing the industry and eliminating “waste” in production. Hoover went sofar as to endorse, in 1927, the CTFs plan to urge each of the member firms tocut production by a certain definite amount.[25] [part0022.html#fn25]One of the clearest indications of how far removed Hoover was from laissez-fairewas his leading role in nationalizing the airwaves of the fledgling radioindustry. Hoover put through the nationalizing Radio Act in 1927 as a substitutefor the courts’ increasing application of the common law, granting privateownership of the airwaves to the first radio stations that put them intouse.[26] [part0022.html#fn26]One of the most pervasive and least studied methods by which Hoover helped tomonopolize industry during the 1920s was to impose standardization and“simplification” of materials and products. In this way, Hoover managed toeliminate the “least necessary” varieties of a myriad of products, greatlyreducing the number of competitive sizes, for example, of automobile wheels andtires, and threads for nuts and bolts. All in all, about three thousand articleswere thus “simplified.” The recommendations for simplification were worked outby the Department of Commerce with the aid of the eager committees representingeach trade.[27] [part0022.html#fn27]Hoover’s approach to the farm question was consistent: a repeated emphasis onthe cartelization of agriculture.[28] [part0022.html#fn28] At first, the favoredmeans was the subsidizing by government of farm cooperatives. Hoover helpedwrite the act of August, 1921, which expanded the funds allotted to the WarFinance Corporation and permitted it to lend directly to the farm co-ops. Healso supported the farm-bloc bill for an extensive system of FederalIntermediate Credit Banks and a Federal Farm Loan Board, which were to lendfederal funds to farm co-ops. In the Department of Commerce, he was able to helpfarm co-ops with marketing programs and with aid in finding export markets.Hoover soon enlarged his ideas of farm intervention; he was one of the earliestproponents of a Federal Farm Board, designed to raise and support farm prices bycreating federal stabilization corporations that were to purchase farm productsand to lend money to farm co-ops for such purchases. And to this end, in 1924,Hoover helped write the unsuccessful Capper-Williams Bill. As a presidentialcandidate in 1928 he promised the farm bloc that he would promptly institute afarm price-support program.[29] [part0022.html#fn29] It was a promise that hehastened to keep, for as soon as he became president, Hoover drove through theAgricultural Marketing Act of 1929. This Act created a Federal Farm Board with arevolving fund of $500 million to raise and support farm prices and to aid farmco-ops; the Board was to conduct its price-raising operations throughstabilization corporations for the various commodities, with the corporationsalso serving as marketing agencies for the coops. Furthermore, Hoover appointedto the Board representatives of the various agricultural and farm co-opinterests: a cartelization operated by the cartelists themselves.[30][part0022.html#fn30]2. HERBERT HOOVER FIGHTS THE GREAT DEPRESSIONMobilizer and economic planner of World War I; persistent advocate ofcartelization and government-business partnership in stabilizing industry;pioneer in promoting a pro-union outlook in industry as a method of insuring thecooperation of labor; booster of high wages as a sustainer of purchasing powerand business prosperity; ardent proponent of massive public-works schemes duringdepressions; advocate of government programs to boost farm prices and farmco-ops; no one could have been as ideally suited as Herbert Clark Hoover to bepresident at the onset of a Great Depression and to react with a radical programof statism to be trumpeted as a “New Deal.” And that is precisely what HerbertHoover did. It is one of the great ironies of historiography that the founder ofevery single one of the features of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal was to becomeenshrined among historians and the general public as the last stalwart defenderof laissez-faire.Let us consider the New Deal—a rapid intensification of government interventionthat began in response to a severe depression, and featured: cartelization ofindustry through government-and-business planning; bolstering of prices and wagerates, expansion of credit, massive unemployment relief and public-worksprograms, support of farm prices, and propping up of weak and unsound businesspositions. Every one of these features was founded, and consciously so, byPresident Hoover. Hoover consciously and deliberately broke sharply and rapidlywith the whole American tradition of a laissez-faire response to depression. AsHoover himself proclaimed during his presidential campaign of 1932:> ... we might have done nothing. That would have been utter ruin. Instead we> met the situation with proposals to private business and to Congress of the> most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in> the history of the Republic. We put it into action. ... No government in> Washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for> leadership in such times. ... For the first time in the history of> depressions, dividends, profits and the cost of living, have been reduced> before wages have suffered. ... They were maintained until the cost of living> had decreased and the profits had practically vanished. They are now the> highest real wages in the world.[31] [part0022.html#fn31]Hoover began his “gigantic” program as soon as the stock market crashed onOctober 24, 1929. His most fateful act was to call a series of White HouseConferences with the nation’s leading financiers and industrialists and inducethem to pledge that wage rates would not be lowered and that they would expandtheir investments. Hoover explained the general aim of these conferences to bethe coordination of business and government agencies in concerted action.Industrial group after group pledged that wage rates would be maintained. Hooverinsisted that, contrary to previous depressions when wage rates fell promptlyand rapidly (and, we might add, the depression was then soon over), wage ratesmust now be the last to fall, in order to prop up mass purchasing power. Theentire burden of the recession, then, must fall upon business profits. The mostimportant of these conferences occurred on November 21, when such greatindustrial leaders as Henry Ford, Julius Rosenwald, Walter Teagle, Owen D.Young, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., and Pierre du Pont pledged their cooperation to theHoover program. These agreements were made public, and Hoover hailed them at aWhite House conference on December 5, as an “advance in the whole conception ofthe relationship of business to public welfare ... a far cry from the arbitraryand dog-eat-dog attitude of ... the business world of some thirty or forty yearsago.” The AF of L lauded this new development; never before, it proclaimed, havethe industrial leaders “been called upon to act together ...”[32][part0022.html#fn32] By the following March, the AF of L was reporting that thebig corporations were indeed keeping their agreement to maintain wage rates.[33][part0022.html#fn33]In September, 1930, Hoover took another step to relieve unemployment and, by theway, to prop up wage rates. By administrative decree, Hoover in effect barredalmost all further immigration into the country. In keeping with this policy ofcuring unemployment by forcing people out of the labor force, he deliberatelyaccelerated the deportation of “undesirable” aliens, the deportation levelreaching 20,000 per year.The wage agreement held firm in the midst of a cataclysmic Depression andunprecedented and prolonged mass unemployment.[34] [part0022.html#fn34] In fact,since prices were falling rapidly, this meant that the real wage rates of thoselucky enough to remain employed were increasing sharply. The economist LeoWolman noted at the time that it “is indeed impossible to recall any pastdepression of similar intensity and duration in which the wages of prosperitywere maintained as long as they have been in the depression of 1930–31.”[35][part0022.html#fn35] It was a record hailed by liberals from the AF of L to JohnMaynard Keynes. It was only by 1932, after several years of severe depressionand catastrophic unemployment, that businesses could keep up wage rates nolonger. When, in the fall of 1931, the United States Steel Corporation finallysummoned up the courage to cut wage rates, it did so over the opposition of itsown president and to the accusation of William Green that its 1929 pledge to theWhite House was being violated.[36] [part0022.html#fn36] The large firms wereparticularly slow to break the agreement, and even then many of the cuts weremade in executive salaries where the unemployment problem was at a minimum. Evenwith the cuts in wages, wage rates fell by only 23% from 1929 to 1933—less thanthe decline of prices. Thus, real wage rates actually rose over the period, byover 8% in the leading manufacturing industries. The drop in wage rates had beenfar more prompt and extensive in the far milder 1921 depression. In the face ofthis record of wage maintenance, the unemployment rate rose to 25% of the laborforce by 1933, and to a phenomenal 46% in the leading manufacturing industries.There were, unfortunately, only a few observers and economists who understoodthe causal connection between these events: that maintenance of wage rates wasprecisely the major factor in deepening and prolonging mass unemployment and theDepression.[37] [part0022.html#fn37]Hoover did his best, furthermore, to engineer a massive inflation of money andcredit. In the crucial figure of government securities owned by the FederalReserve Banks, Federal Reserve holdings rose from $300 million in September,1929, to $1,840 million in March, 1933—a sixfold increase. Ordinarily this wouldhave led to a sixfold expansion of bank reserves and an enormous inflation ofthe money supply. But the Hoover drive for inflation was thwarted by the forcesof the economy. Federal Reserve rediscounts fell by half a billion due tosluggish business demand, despite a sharp drop in the Federal Reserve’s discountrate, cash in circulation increased by one and a half billion due to thepublic’s growing distrust of the shaky and inflated banking system, and thebanks began to pile up excess reserves because of their fear of makinginvestments amidst the sea of business failures. The Hoover Administration grewlivid with the banks, and Hoover denounced the “lack of cooperation of thecommercial banks ... in the credit expansion drive.” Atlee Pomerene, head of theReconstruction Finance Corporation, went so far as to declare that any bank thatis liquid and doesn’t extend its loans is a “parasite on the country.”[38][part0022.html#fn38] Hoover told Secretary of the Treasury Ogden Mills to form acommittee of leading industrialists and bankers to pressure the banks intoextending their credit.[39] [part0022.html#fn39] By the end of his term and theabject failure of his inflationist program, Hoover was proposing what are surelytypical New Deal measures: bank holidays and at least temporary federal“insurance” of bank deposits.In fact, Hoover seriously considered invoking a forgotten wartime law making the“hoarding” of gold (that is, redemption of dollars into gold) a criminaloffense.[40] [part0022.html#fn40] Although he did not go that far, he did tryhis best to hamper the workings of the gold standard by condemning andblackening the names of people who lawfully redeemed their dollars in gold ortheir bank deposits into cash. In February, 1932, Hoover established theCitizens’ Reconstruction Organization under Colonel Frank Knox of Chicago,dedicated to condemning “hoarders” and unpatriotic “traitors.” Leadingindustrialists and labor leaders joined the CRO. Hoover also secretly tried tostop the American press from printing the full truth about the banking crisisand about the rising public criticism of his Administration.[41][part0022.html#fn41]Neither was Hoover lax in increasing the expenditures of the federal government.Federal expenditures rose from $3.3 billion in fiscal 1929 to $4.6 billion infiscal 1932 and 1933, a rise of 40%. Meanwhile, federal budget receipts fell inhalf, from $4 billion to less than $2 billion, demonstrating that Hoover was somuch of a proto-Keynesian that he was willing to incur a deficit of nearly 60%of the budget. This was, to that moment, the largest peacetime federal deficitin American history.Part of this massive rise of federal expenditures went, as one might expect,into public works. So promptly did Hoover act to expand public works (proposinga $600 million increase by December, 1929) that by the end of 1929 the economistJ.M. Clark was already hailing Hoover’s “great experiment in constructiveindustrial statesmanship.”[42] [part0022.html#fn42] In February, 1931, Hoover’sEmergency Committee for Employment was instrumental in pushing through CongressSenator Wagner’s (D., N.Y.) Employment Stabilization Act, which established anEmployment Stabilization Board to expand public works in a depression, and afund of $150 million to put the plan into effect. In happily signing themeasure, Hoover gave a large amount of credit to the veteran public-worksagitator, Otto Tod Mallery.[43] [part0022.html#fn43] In his memoirs, Hooverrecalled with pride that his Administration had constructed more public worksthan had the federal government over the previous thirty years, and that hepersonally had induced state and local governments to expand their public-worksprograms by $1.5 billion. He also launched the Boulder, Grand Coulee, andCalifornia Central Valley dams, and, after agitating for the project since 1921,Hoover signed a treaty with Canada to build a St. Lawrence Seaway, a treatyrejected by the Senate.[44] [part0022.html#fn44] Furthermore, the Boulderproject was the first example of large-scale, federal, multipurpose river basinplanning.[45] [part0022.html#fn45]It must be noted, however, that in the last year of his term, Hoover, theveteran pioneer of public-works stabilization, began to find the acceleratingmovement toward ever greater public works going beyond him. As writers,economists, politicians, businessmen, and the construction industry calledloudly for many billions in public works, Hoover began to draw back. He began tosee public works as costly, and as bringing relief to a selected group only. Hecame to favor a relatively greater emphasis on federal grants-in-aid and onpublic works that would be self-liquidating. As a result, federal public-worksspending increased only slightly during 1932. As we shall see, Hoover’s growingdoubts on public works were symptomatic of a more general process of being leftbehind by the accelerating onrush toward collectivist thinking that developedduring his final year as president.[46] [part0022.html#fn46]Another massive dose of government intervention was President Hoover’s Home LoanBank System, established in the Federal Home Loan Act of July, 1932. Supportedenthusiastically by the building and loan associations, the act paralleled theFederal Reserve Act in relation to these associations. Twelve district bankswere established under a Federal Home Loan Bank Board, with a $25 millioncapital supplied by the Treasury, as a compulsory, central mortgage-discountbank for the building and loan industry. Hoover had originally proposed agrandiose national mortgage-discount system that would also include savingsbanks and insurance companies, but the latter refused to agree to the scheme. Asit was, Hoover complained that Congress had placed excessively rigorous limitson the amount of discounting that could be made by the Board; but he did hisbest to spur use of the new system.One of Mr. Hoover’s clearest harbingers of the New Deal was his creation inJanuary, 1932, of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The RFC was clearlyinspired by and modelled after the old wartime War Finance Corporation, whichhad extended emergency loans to business. One of the leading originators of theRFC was Eugene Meyer, Jr., Governor of the Federal Reserve Board and formerManaging Director of the WFC; most of the old WFC staff were employed by the neworganization.[47] [part0022.html#fn47]The RFC began in the fall of 1931 as the National Credit Corporation, throughwhich leading banks were persuaded, at a secret conference with Hoover and hisaides, to extend credit to shaky banks, with Federal Reserve assistance. Whenthe banks balked at this scheme, Hoover threatened legislation to compel theircooperation; in return for their agreement to the NCC, the Administration agreedthat it would be strictly temporary, to be replaced soon by an RFC.The RFC bill was passed hurriedly by Congress in January, 1932. The Treasuryfurnished it with half a billion dollars, and it was empowered to issuedebentures up to $1.5 billion. Meyer was chosen to be chairman of the neworganization. In the first half of 1932, the RFC extended, in the deepestsecrecy, $1 billion of loans, largely to banks and railroads.[48][part0022.html#fn48] The railroads received nearly $50 million simply to repaydebts to the large banks, notably J.P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb and Co. Oneof the important enthusiasts for this policy was Eugene Meyer, Jr., on thegrounds of “promoting recovery” and frankly, of “putting more money into thebanks.” Meyer’s enthusiasm might well have been bolstered by the fact that hisbrother-in-law, George Blumenthal, was an officer of J.P. Morgan & Co., and thathe himself had served as an officer of the Morgan bank.But Hoover wasn’t satisfied with the massiveness of the RFC program. He insistedthat RFC be able to lend more widely to industry and to agriculture, and that itbe able to make capital loans. This amendment—the Emergency Relief andConstruction Act—passed Congress in July, 1932; the Act nearly doubled total RFCcapital from $2 billion to $3.8 billion and greatly widened the scope of RFClending.[49] [part0022.html#fn49] During 1932, the RFC extended loans totaling$2.3 billion.Herbert Hoover’s enthusiasm for government aid to industry and banking was notmatched in the area of Depression relief to the poor; here his instincts weremuch more voluntarist. Hoover steadfastly maintained his voluntary reliefposition until mid-1932. As early as 1930/31, he had been pressured on behalf offederal relief by Colonel Arthur Woods, the Chairman of Hoover’s EmergencyCommittee for Employment, who had previously been a member of Rockefeller’sGeneral Education Board. But in mid-1932 a group of leading Chicagoindustrialists was instrumental in persuading Hoover to change his mind andestablish a federal relief program. In addition to widening the powers of theRFC loans to industry, Hoover’s Emergency Relief and Construction Act was thenation’s first federal relief legislation. The RFC was authorized to lend $300million to the states for poor relief.[50] [part0022.html#fn50]Throughout the Depression, Herbert Hoover gave vent to his long-standing dislikeof speculation and the stock market. In the fall of 1930, Hoover threatenedfederal regulation of the New York Stock Exchange, hitherto thought to beconstitutionally subject only to state regulation. Hoover forced the Exchange toagree “voluntarily” to withhold loans for purposes of short selling. Hooverreturned to the attack during 1932, threatening federal action against shortselling. He also induced the Senate to investigate “sinister ... bear raids” onthe Exchange. Hoover seemed to find it sinful and vaguely traitorous for thestock market to judge stock values on the basis of current (low) earnings.Hoover went on to propose what later came to pass as the New Deal’s SEC, aregulation that Hoover openly applauded.Hoover’s Federal Farm Board was ready to move when the Depression arrived andthe FFB proceeded on its proto-New Deal farm policy of attempting to raise andsupport farm prices.The FFB’s first big operation was in wheat. The Board advised the receptivewheat farmers to act like cartelists: in short, to hold wheat off the market andwait for higher prices. Soon it began to lend $100 million to wheat co-ops towithhold wheat stocks, and thereby raise prices; and it established a centralgrain corporation to centralize and coordinate the wheat cooperatives. When theloans to coops failed to stem the tide of falling wheat prices, the graincorporation began to buy wheat on its own. The FFB loans and purchases managedto sustain wheat prices for a time; but by the spring of 1930 this had onlyaggravated the wheat surplus by inducing farmers to expand their production, andthe only result was further declines in price.It became clear to the Hoover Administration that the cartelizing andprice-raising policy could not work unless wheat production was reduced. Atypical Hooverian round of attempted voluntary persuasion ensued, led by theSecretary of Agriculture and the FFB; a group of economists was sent fromWashington to urge the marginal Northwestern wheat farmers—the originalagitators for wheat price supports—to shift from wheat into some other crop.Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde and the FFB’s Alexander Legge toured theMiddle West, urging farmers to lower their wheat acreage. But, as could havebeen foreseen, none of this moral exhortation was effective, and wheat surplusescontinued to pile up and prices to fall. By November, the government’s GrainStabilization Corporation had purchased over 65 million bushels of wheat to holdoff the market, but to no avail. Then, in November, 1930, Hoover authorized theGSC to purchase as much wheat as might be necessary to stop any further fall inwheat prices. But economic forces could not be defeated so easily, and wheatprices continued to fall. Finally, the FFB conceded defeat and dumped itsaccumulated wheat stocks, further intensifying the fall in wheat prices.Similar price-support programs were tried in cotton, but with similar disastrousresults. Chairman James C. Stone of the Federal Farm Board even tried tomobilize the state governors to plow under every third row of cotton, but stillto no avail. Similar calamitous attempts at cartelization occurred in wool,butter, grapes, and tobacco.It was becoming clear that the cartelizing program could not work unless therewere compulsory restrictions on production; there were simply too many farmersfor voluntary exhortations to have any effect. President Hoover began to movedown that road, recommending at least that productive land be withdrawn fromcultivation, that crops be plowed under, and that immature farm animals beslaughtered—all to reduce the very surpluses that Hoover’s price supports hadaccumulated.[51] [part0022.html#fn51]Meanwhile, President Hoover pursued cartelization in other fields with moresuccess. In May, 1931, he ordered the cessation of new leases in the federalforests for purposes of lumbering. He also withdrew over two million acres offorest land from production and into “national forests,” and increased the areaof national parks by 40%.[52] [part0022.html#fn52]Hoover put through the McNary-Watres Act of April, 1930, which deliberately usedpostal air-mail subsidies and regulation to bring commercial airlines underfederal organization and control. Hoover’s admiring biographers wrote that as aresult of this law, “The routes were consolidated into a carefully plannednational system of commercial airways. ... The Nation was saved from ahodgepodge of airways similar to the tangle that had grown up in railtransportation.”[53] [part0022.html#fn53]Hoover also urged upon Congress what would have been the first federalregulation of electric power companies. Hoover’s original proposal was to givethe Federal Power Commission the power to set interstate power rates incollaboration with state power commissions. But Congress refused to go that far,and the FPC, although expanded, continued to exercise power only over waterpower in rivers.In the coal industry, Hoover sympathized with the Appalachian Coal combine,which marketed three-quarters of Appalachian bituminous coal, in an attempt toraise coal prices and allocate production quotas to the various coal mines.Hoover also called for the reduction of “destructive competition” reigning inthe coal industry.[54] [part0022.html#fn54]Hoover was more specific in helping to cartelize the oil industry. Hoover andhis Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur stimulated such states as Texasand Oklahoma to pass oil proration laws in the name of “conservation” to curtailcrude oil production and thereby raise prices and to establish an interstatecompact to collaborate in the proration program. Hoover also aided these laws bysuspending all further oil leases on public lands and by pressuring oiloperators near the public domain to agree to restrict oil production.In sponsoring and encouraging proration laws particularly, Hoover was taking hisstand with the large oil companies. Hoover and Wilbur’s suggestion of generalSunday shutdowns of oil production was approved by the large companies, butdefeated by the opposition of the smaller producers. The smaller firmsparticularly urged a protective tariff on imported crude and petroleum products,which Hoover finally agreed to in 1932. The tariff served to make the domesticcartel and proration laws more generally effective. In its restriction ofimports, the tariff demonstrated that the drive for proration laws had little todo with simply conserving domestic oil reserves, but was rather aimed at cuttingthe supply of oil available to the domestic market.Despite these services by Hoover, the oil industry was still restive; theindustry wanted more, it wanted federal legislation in outright support ofrestricting production and raising prices. Here, too, President Hoover wasbeginning to lose the leadership of the accelerating cartelization movement inAmerican industry.[55] [part0022.html#fn55]In the cotton textile industry, the trade association, the Cotton TextileInstitute, which had long been close to Hoover, cunningly decided to press formonopolistic curtailment of production under the guise of “humanitarianism.” Thedevice was to call for the abolition of night work for women and children; sucha drive was neatly calculated to appeal both to Hoover’s (and to the industry’s)monopoloid convictions, as well as to his humanitarian rhetoric. CTI’s campaignof 1930/31 to pressure the various mills to abolish night work for women andchildren was substantially aided by Hoover and his Department of Commerce, whoactively “helped to whip the non-cooperators into line.” Hoover publicized hisfirm support, and Secretary of Commerce Lamont sent personal letters to cottontextile operators, urging their adherence to the plan.[56] [part0022.html#fn56]Intense Administration pressure continued throughout 1931 and 1932. Lamontcalled a special conference to which he brought several leading bankers and theendorsement of Hoover to pressure the holdouts into line.But this cartel scheme also failed, for cotton textile prices continued to fall.As a result, compliance with the curtailment of production began to crack. Thecartel failed for reasons similar to the failure of the FFB: despite the intenseAdministration pressure, the production cuts remained only voluntary. So long asthere was no outright governmental compulsion on the textile firms to obey theproduction quotas, prices could not be raised. By 1932, the cotton textileindustry, too, was becoming impatient with its old friend Hoover; the industrywas rapidly beginning to agitate for governmental coercion to make cartelizationwork.[57] [part0022.html#fn57]This attitude of the cotton textile, petroleum, and agricultural industriesspread rapidly throughout American industry during 1931 and 1932: an impatiencewith the pace of America’s movement toward the corporate state. Under the impactof the Great Depression, American industry, along with the nation’sintellectuals and labor leaders, began to clamor for the outright collectivismof a corporate state—for federal organization of trade associations intocompulsory cartels for restricting production and raising prices. In short, ageneral clamor arose for an economy of fascism.The most important call for the compulsory cartelization of a corporate statewas sounded by Gerard Swope, the veteran corporate liberal who headed GeneralElectric. Swope delivered his famous “Swope Plan” before the National ElectricalManufacturers Association in the fall of 1931, and it was endorsed by the UnitedStates Chamber of Commerce in December.[58] [part0022.html#fn58] Particularlyenthusiastic was Henry I. Harriman, president of the Chamber, who declared thatany dissenting businessmen would be “treated like any maverick. ... They’ll beroped and branded, and made to run with the herd.”[59] [part0022.html#fn59]Charles F. Abbott of the American Institute of Steel Construction hailed theSwope Plan as “a measure of public safety” to crack down on “the blusteringindividual who claims the right to do as he pleases.”[60] [part0022.html#fn60]The AF of L endorsed a similar program, with a slightly greater share to go tothe unions in overall control; particularly enthusiastic were John L. Lewis andSidney Hillman, later to form the New Deal-oriented CIO.[61][part0022.html#fn61]Dr. Virgil Jordan, economist for the National Industrial Conference Board,summed up the state of business opinion when he concluded, approvingly, thatbusinessmen were ready for an “economic Mussolini.”[62] [part0022.html#fn62]In the light of Herbert Hoover’s lengthy corporatist career, the businessleaders naturally expected him to agree wholeheartedly with the new drive towardbusiness collectivism.[63] [part0022.html#fn63] Hence they were greatlysurprised and chagrined to find Hoover sharply drawing back from the abyss, frompursuing the very logic toward which his entire career had been leading.It is not unusual for revolutions to devour their fathers and pioneers. As arevolutionary process accelerates, the early leaders begin to draw back from theimplicit logic of their own life work and to leap off the accelerating bandwagonthat they themselves had helped to launch. So it was with Herbert Hoover. Allhis life he had been a dedicated corporatist; but all his life he had also likedto cloak his corporate-state coercion in cloudy voluntarist generalities. Allhis life he had sought and employed the mailed fist of coercion inside thevelvet glove of traditional voluntarist rhetoric. But now his old friends andassociates—men like his longtime aide and Chamber of Commerce leader JuliusBarnes, railroad magnate Daniel Willard, and industrialist Gerard Swope—were ineffect urging him to throw off the voluntarist cloak and to adopt the nakedeconomy of fascism. This Herbert Hoover could not do; and as he saw the newtrend he began to fight it, without at all abandoning any of his previouspositions. Herbert Hoover was being polarized completely out of the acceleratingdrive toward statism; by merely advancing at a far slower pace, the former“progressive” corporatist was now becoming a timid moderate in relation to theswift rush of the ideological current. The former leader and molder of opinionwas becoming passé.[64] [part0022.html#fn64]Hoover began to fight back, and to insist that a certain proportion ofindividualism, a certain degree of the old “American system,” must be preserved.The Swope and similar plans, he charged, would result in a completemonopolization of industry, would establish a vast governmental bureaucracy, andwould regiment society. In short, as Hoover told Henry Harriman in exasperation,the Swope-Chamber of Commerce Plan was, simply, “fascism.”[65][part0022.html#fn65] Herbert Hoover had finally seen the abyss of fascism andwas having none of it.Franklin Roosevelt was to have no such scruples. Hoover’s decision had vitalpolitical consequences: for Harriman told him bluntly at the start of the 1932campaign that Franklin Roosevelt had accepted the Swope Plan—as he was to proveamply with the NRA and AAA. If Hoover persisted in being stubborn, Harrimanwarned, the business world, and especially big business, would back Roosevelt.Hoover’s brusque dismissal led to big business carrying out its threat. It wasHerbert Hoover’s finest hour.[66] [part0022.html#fn66] America’s legion ofcorporate liberals, who found their Holy Grail with the advent of FranklinRoosevelt’s New Deal, never forgave or forgot Herbert Hoover’s hanging back fromAmerica’s entry into the Promised Land. To the angry liberals, Hoover’s cautionlooked very much like old-fashioned laissez-faire. Hence Herbert Hoover’spervasive entry into the public mind as a doughty champion of laissez-faireindividualism.[67] [part0022.html#fn67] It was an ironic ending to the career ofone of the great pioneers of American state corporatism.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally published in A History of Leviathan, Ronald Radosh and Murray N.Rothbard, eds.

Mallery had inspired the nation’s first such stabilization program,in Pennsylvania in 1917, and had been a leading official on public works in theWilson Administration. He was also a leader in the American Association forLabor Legislation, an influential group of eminent citizens, businessmen, andeconomists devoted to government intervention in the fields of labor,employment, and welfare. The AALL, endorsing the Conference, boasted that theConference’s proposals followed the pattern of its own recommendations, whichhad been formulated as far back as 1915. Apart from Mallery, the Conferenceemployed the services of nine economists who were also officials of the AALL.The AALL singled out for particular praise Joseph H. Defrees, of the U.S.Chamber of Commerce, who appealed to business organizations to cooperate withthe Conference’s program, and to accept “business responsibility” for theunemployment problem.See Dorfman, Economic Mind in American Civilization, vol. 4, pp. 7–8; McMullen,“The President’s Unemployment Conference,” p. 16; and John B.

Two of the fathers of the agitation for farm pricesupport were George N. Peek and General Hugh S. Johnson, heads of the MolinePlow Company, one of the largest farm-equipment manufacturers.
