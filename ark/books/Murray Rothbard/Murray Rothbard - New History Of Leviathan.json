ROTHBARD It is now widely understood that the United States in mid- twentieth century is a Leviathan Corporate State—a politi- cal economy dominated by giant multinational corpora- tions whose extensive domain, operating with the levers of government, extends from the local retail outlet to firms negotiating for rights to explore oil deposits offshore of Saigon. But the corporate state, whose pervasive influence has recently been subjected to sharp critiques by Herbert Marcuse, Charles Reich, and Phillip Slater (in The Pursuit of Loneliness [Boston: Beacon Press, 1970]), is by no means a new phenomenon. The corporate leviathan began to emerge at the turn of the twentieth century, after an era of substantial laissez-faire had proceeded to industrialize and urbanize the nation. The essays in this book reveal how and in what manner the corporate state developed in twentieth-century America. They show how a sophisticated group of large corporate reformers managed to replace a freely competi- tive economy and make a new governing class, through the use of reform mechanisms to mold the government into a mighty instrument of monopolization and cartelization. From Theodore Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson to Franklin"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Vi   PREFACE D. Roosevelt to their corporate backers, down to the intel- lectuals who forged theoretical apologia for the new corporatism, these essays show how these sophisticated corporatist reformers sought to stifle the fierce winds of competition and to achieve what James Weinstein has called the \"stabilization, rationalization and continued expansion\" of the new political economy. The ideology of these corporatist reformers was liberal- ism, but this was scarcely the liberalism of popular myth and image. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a noted spokesman for the popular image of liberalism, once wrote that liberal- ism in America has been ordinarily the movement on the part of the other sections of society to restrain the power of the business community. This sort of statement assumes the existence of a broad popular movement, staunchly opposed by business, that arises to challenge and curb the one-sided power of corporate enterprise. But new historical research, much of it presented in this volume, has shown the fallacy of the popular conception. The new twentieth- century liberalism was not antibusiness. On the contrary, new research has shown that liberalism has been the ideology of the dominant business groups and that these groups have consistently favored state intervention in the economy in order to regulate and cartelize business activ- ity. As Gabriel Kolko has remarked in The Triumph of Conservatism, we have had regulation not by, of, and for the mass of the people against large business; rather we have had regulatory mechanisms designed, operated, and staffed by the men who run the corporations themselves—a form of corporate-inspired self-regulation carried on under government aegis. Furthermore, liberal historiography has generally de- picted twentieth-century America as a conflict between good-guy Democrats, leading a farmer-labor Populist coali- tion against big business, in conflict with laissez-faire, business-minded Republicans. This book demonstrates that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface  vii both parties have been dedicated to a large, business- dominated corporate state, with the Democrats perhaps a bit more sophisticated and intense about establishing and advancing the corporatist system. Thus, A New History of Leviathan transcends the ideol- ogy and historiography of liberalism. One unusual aspect of the book is that the selections were made by, and three of the essays written by, two editors, each of whom launch their joint critique from widely differing perspectives. Mur- ray N. Rothbard is one of the intellectual leaders of the new \"right-wing libertarian movement\"—a movement that has emerged out of what has come to be called the Old Right, the American libertarian tradition beginning with Jefferson and Paine and continuing in the twentieth cen- tury in the thought and politics of such people as H. L. Mencken, Garet Garrett, Oswald Garrison Villard, John T. Flynn, and Senator Robert A. Taft. A firm believer in laissez-faire capitalism, Rothbard is a free-market econo- mist, a former contributor to National Review, and a member of the executive committee of the National Tax- payers Union. Ronald Radosh, on the other hand, emerges from the ranks of the New Left. As an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, he was an active member of the Wisconsin Socialist Club, and functioned as an associate editor of the radical journal, Studies on the Left. Working with this group, he was among those who developed the critique of the system and ideology of corpo- rate liberalism, a term that came into widespread use and popularity with the political leadership of Carl Oglesby 1 in the mid-1960s and the emergence of Students for a Demo- cratic Society. Unlike Murray Rothbard, Ronald Radosh is a libertarian socialist who believes in the creation of a 1 Carl Oglesby and Richard Schaull, Containment and Change (New York: Macmillan, 1967)."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Vlll   PREFACE radical consciousness as a prerequisite for the forging of a socialist politico-economic structure. How is it that an archexponent of laissez-faire capitalism can coedit a collection on the Leviathan Corporate State with a firm believer in the necessity of socialist revolution? The answer is that each, because of his critique of liberal ideology and concepts, has been able in his own work to transcend the ideological myths that enable the large cor- porations to mask their hegemony over American society. One might look only at the editors' essays on Herbert Hoover (Rothbard) and the New Deal era (Radosh) to see how the transcendence of liberalism has enabled each author to bypass the mythology that has blocked full comprehension of these respective periods. To liberals, Hoover was the bad guy and F.D.R. the good guy. Demo- crats blamed the Depression on Hoover for his allegedly laissez-faire policies (much as Republicans were later to blame Harry S Truman for \"losing\" China), and praised Roosevelt for taking strong affirmative action on behalf of the poor and unemployed. But as the authors show, Herbert Hoover was actually the precursor of the entire New Deal system, and Roose- velt only carried out to its logical end the politics de- veloped by Hoover and other elements of the corporate economy. Adherence to the liberal framework prevents others from grasping the fundamental truths about these periods, as the essays point out in detail. Awareness that the nature of liberalism has been distorted to mask large corporate control over American politics is essential for interpreting our past development, and for understanding how the Leviathan Corporate State operates today. There are, of course, major political and philosophical differences between the editors, and therefore between the authors of the essays in this volume. Most obviously, one favors removing the privileges of the large corporations and returning to laissez-faire, whereas the other favors a"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Preface  ix decentralized socialist economy. But political differences may be submerged when it comes to using basic analytical techniques, when it comes, in short, to challenging the preeminent liberal ideology of mainstream corporate America and its academic and intellectual servants.

Not, of course, in the sense that they are immune to the unconscious forces that affect all men; or that they cor- rectly anticipate the outcome of their various enterprises. The crucial point is that the leaders do proceed from philosophies, objectives, and data to their conclusions, policies, and actions. They do not make policy willy-nilly, in absentminded casualness; they knowingly undertake to accomplish precisely what they have carefully decided upon. Such knowledge is a three-edged sword. First, it makes the world a more scary place to pursue life—let alone happiness. Yet, second, it does lay one ghost of the histori- cal profession: no one can now seriously maintain that the elite knows not what it does; meaning that it will no longer do to write history as if the men who made the decisions did not use their minds. That is a great advance, for in truth the issue has always been not whether they thought, but how and what they thought. Still, there is the third edge of knowing (one that these authors unfortunately"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2   INTRODUCTION ignore): if consciousness can commit these violations of democracy and equity, what can control consciousness? That question will be faced a bit later. Consider now another truth offered by the men and women who risked much to give us the Pentagon Papers: the visceral and far- ranging elitism of the leaders of a society ostensibly com- mitted to the principle and practice of responsive and responsible representative government. It has been argued, with some force, that the Founding Fathers were guided by the exquisitely contradictory concept of elitist democracy. I suggest instead that most of those men sought to realize the idea of a stratified community in which those with wealth and power acknowledged and sought to honor certain duties and responsibilities to those who were less favored, among which was the important obligation not to misuse their inferiors. The true architects of elitist democracy, I would argue, were the Jacksonian Democrats. However one decides that issue, what we now have is conscious, willful, and managed elitism with very little representation, responsiveness, or democracy. And that is precisely the condition that the authors of this volume are concerned to comprehend: to understand the origins and development, to analyze the nature, and to probe the consequences of the existing elitist political economy. Given their subject, it is important to realize at the outset that they do not write as members of one school or faction. Each of them is significantly different from the others in one or more vital respects. Their interests vary, their minds work in tangential, even crisscrossing, patterns, and their personal philosophies and politics span a broad spectrum. That in itself makes this collection impressive: different men dealing with different evidence in different ways arriv- ing at conclusions that reinforce each other. Another strik- ing feature of the volume is the cumulative impact of the various approaches, data, and analyses. American corpo- rate capitalism is an extremely powerful instrument con- sciously designed and laboriously created to control human"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction  3 and natural resources within very clearly understood limits, and to use those materials for purposes very largely defined by a tiny minority of the population. Control, organize, rationalize, and deploy are the words that repeatedly come to mind as one works his way through these essays. All these writers avoid the traditional snare of setting ideas and economics off against each other as exclusive categories. They understand that there is no necessity to choose between those dynamic aspects of life—and policy- making. The true question concerns the nature of the interaction. They are dealing with four kinds of men who have come to complement each other in the evolution of the contemporary American elite; and, individually and collectively, the authors reveal how each type has matured by incorporating himself with the other three. Thus the modern business director, learning from the necessity of rationalizing his labor force as an essential element of production (meaning to insure routine profits and power), and needing sustained access to the govern- ment's vast fund of capital provided by the citizen taxpayer (and to various other government services), has no choice but to become a reformer and a politician. His support for reform is often limited to the minimum number of changes required at any given moment. And he may focus his political energy on keeping a firm hand on local and state government, making only an occasional foray into the national arena. But the economic leader who seeks full membership in the corporate elite must go further in both activities. And to do so he must become, in some fashion and to some degree, an intellectual. In one respect, of course, the di- rector of any large-scale economic enterprise is already an intellectual: he has proved his ability to make sense of, and thereby master, one segment of reality. If he is to extend that power of command into the greater world, however, he must enlarge the range of his intellect. Over the years, a growing number of such men have directly expanded the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4  INTRODUCTION scope and power of their minds. Others have relied more heavily on the research foundations and the universities, or on the professional intellectuals who have gone into the marketplace with the hope of making a killing by mer- chandising that kind of service. But, whatever the tech- nique, the requirement must be met in order to be admitted to the high councils of the elite. In a similar way, the modern politician, perhaps most fully, and certainly first, typified by Woodrow Wilson, recognizes that he must abandon the nineteenth-century strategy of serving as the honest broker for various eco- nomic interest groups and move on to acquire the more difficult skills of systematizing the entire political economy. That gives him at least as great an, if also a different, economic interest and stake in the system as the one held by the traditional nineteenth-century entrepreneur. For the modern politician loses power if he cannot sustain a mini- mum level of performance by the economic system. Like his economic counterpart, therefore, such a politi- cian must become something of an intellectual. He must be able to comprehend how the pieces go together even if he does not have the skills to find that out for himself; and it is an insular error of academicians to assume that only they have that ability. Finally, since the system has never functioned in a routinely effective manner, such a politi- cian must be a reformer who is able to muster the public support (or manipulate the general indifference) that is required to effect the necessary changes of the moment. The intellectual who seeks to scramble up the sand hill to the antechamber of the elite must first of all cease being a scholar and become a servant of the system. There is some confusion about the nature of this change. Contrary to much criticism of such men and women, they continue to use their minds with traditional rigor. They merely apply their abilities to a particular aspect of reality: the continu- ing operation of the existing system. The ones who gain most influence (and related rewards) are of necessity"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction  5 energetic, astute, imaginative, and effective. The system needs all the help it can buy—or seduce. Such an intellec- tual, even if he began his serious work pursuing an interest in the inequitable distribution of income, or the regressive nature of the income tax, must master the economics of the corporation and the intricacies of the interlocking system. It does him no good, after all, to answer questions that are not asked by the corporate elite. He must also become a subtle politician: one of those who deal only in influence rather than power. For the giants among the elite (themselves rather impressive intel- lectuals) have seen to it that experts are a glut upon the market. Their strategy has been awesome: they have cre- ated, in the disguise of what most citizens consider a college education, a vast system of unimaginative voca- tional training paid for by the very parents who consider it an escalator to power for their children and the key to the general welfare. It has been a covert coup d'etat of almost classic proportions, and the failure of any of these authors to explore and expose it is the only major defect of their work. The product of such an education who joins the system becomes an intellectual who can only be described as an efficient (and often well-paid) combination of court jester, royal favorite ever looking over his shoulder, bril- liant eunuch, and uncommitted devil's advocate. He is also a reformer. First, and understandably, in his own interest: either to obtain a pension through less demeaning devices than are currently effective, or to extend the civil service system to all who have written a position paper for a cabinet member. Second, and more in keeping with his services, to rationalize the pecking order so that his recommendations are not rewritten by a mere adminis- trative assistant. Third, and most consequentially, because he knows the system must be reformed if it is to have any chance of survival. And so to the reformer. He very probably suffers most of all. Almost by definition, and surely by much honorable tradition, the reformer is expected to specialize in moral"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6  INTRODUCTION issues. Yet, beginning with Wilson (even with Theodore Roosevelt), the politician has claimed that power base for his very own. Even the intellectuals and the sophisticated corporation bosses have cut into the territory. The re- former has little choice but to become an intellectual or a politician specializing in advocating the grievances of the worker, minority group, the taxpayer-as-consumer, or the citizen as human being. He can, even today, be sporadi- cally effective, but he earns little credit or satisfaction. Some other member of the elite expropriates the praise for any idea that works, or blames him for those that fail. Most painfully, the reformer knows how little he has changed reality. The truth, of course, is that the corporate elite views morality as a mostly outmoded—surely last-ditch—means to other ends. Everything must be organized, rationalized, and managed. No room at the top for morality save as a sometime instrument of manipulation. But in reality that is dangerous nonsense: the most absurd of the dreams that we humans have ever remembered the following morning. It is, likewise, the most frightful bargain that Faust can negotiate with the Devil. For if signed, the two become one. Better to be an errant man than survive as an instru- ment or a subject. So we return to the issue of consciousness. These au- thors argue that the existing corporate system has carried us well onto the threshold of a gentle totalitarianism. They imply that consciousness, if married to morality, can save us from entering that hell. That means they have a deeply moving faith in you, the citizen-as-reader. They believe in you so fully that they do not think it is necessary to go on to say that we all together must do something about the existing state of affairs—meaning the existing state. I, too, believe in you, but I shall say more: We will need more than consciousness and morality. We will have to muster our will, our courage, and our very best ideas. Otherwise the system will systematize us all."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson and the Political Economy of Modern United States Liberalism MARTIN J. SKLAR . . . Most persons are so thoroughly uninformed as to my opinions that I have concluded that the only things they have not read are my speeches. —Woodrow Wilson, 1912 Perhaps the greatest source of historical misconception about Woodrow Wilson is the methodological compart- mentalization of his mentality into two distinct compo- nents, the \"moralistic\" and the \"realistic\" or \"commercial- istic,\" as if they were discrete and mutually exclusive. From this point of departure, if one thinks or acts \"moral- istically,\" he cannot be considered capable at the same time of thinking and acting \"realistically,\" at least not consis- tently: if one is a \"moralist,\" his political behavior can be considered as deriving only secondarily, if at all, from an understanding of, or a serious concern for, the affairs of political economy. According to this approach, wherever Wilson is per- ceived to have spoken or acted for the \"little man,\" \"democracy,\" \"liberty,\" \"individual opportunity,\" and the like, he was \"liberal\" and moralistic; wherever he is per- ceived to have spoken or acted for corporate interests, economic expansion abroad, and the like, he was \"con-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN servative,\" \"commercialistic,\" \"expedient,\" or realistic. Where Wilson supported measures promoting large corpo- rate interests at home or abroad, he is considered to have forsaken his moralism, to have been driven by political expediency, personal egoism, or implacable social and economic forces, or to have gathered the unintended con- sequences of a misdirected moralism. In this view, Wilson the moralist is generally considered the true type, and Wilson the realist, the deviant. Aside from objections that may be raised against the naivete and theoretical deficiencies of such an approach to social thought and ideology in general, 1 certain specific objections may be raised against such an approach to Wil- son, particularly should the main ideological components generally attributed to Wilson's mentality be granted at the outset, and their implications accorded a modicum of examination. First, the \"Puritan ethic,\" to which students of Wilson have attached fundamental importance as basic to his mentality, made no such mutually exclusive distinction be- tween a transcendent morality and the world of political economy. Puritanism embraced a morality applicable not merely to the world beyond, but as well to the living indi- vidual and existing society; it sanctioned, indeed posited, capitalist social and economic relations. The affirmation of capitalist society was therefore implicit in Wilson's Protes- tant morality. From the straightest-laced New England Puritan of the seventeenth century to Poor Richard's Benjamin Franklin, to Gospel-of-Wealth Andrew Carnegie, to \"New Freedom\" Woodrow Wilson, religious conviction and \"marketplace materialism\" were each practical, each the uplifting agent of civilization and Providence, each the 1 See Karl Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia (New York: Har- vest Book edition, 1955), pp. 59-70. Mannheim here distin- guishes between the \"particular conception of ideology\" and the \"total conception of ideology\"; it is in terms of the latter that Wilson's world view is comprehended in this essay."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson and U.S. Liberalism 9 necessary condition for personal salvation and general human improvement, each a function of the other, mutually interdependent and interwoven like the white and purple threads of the single holy cloth. To the extent, then, that Puritanism entered significantly into Wilson's world view, the affirmation of the capitalist system in the United States (and throughout the world) was a function of his morality, not merely an auxiliary prepossession. Second, Wilson's moral affirmation of capitalism sanc- tioned by Puritan conceptions found powerful confirma- tion in the economic writings of Adam Smith (himself a professor of moral philosophy), John Bright, and Richard Cobden; as student and professor he had become firmly grounded in their theories of political economy, which he admired and enthusiastically espoused, and it is not diffi- cult to perceive that such writings would strongly appeal to one reared on Puritanism. In Smith, Bright, and Cobden, Wilson found secular moral sanction for the bourgeois- democratic political economy as well as indefeasible eco- nomic principles. Private, competitive enterprise mani- fested natural law in the realm of political economy, and went hand in hand with republican institutions, com- prising together the essential conditions of democracy, individual liberty, and increasing prosperity. To Wilson, much of whose economic thinking was based upon the assumption of the growing superiority of United States industry, the arguments of Smith, Cobden, and Bright were compelling: they, in their day, spoke for an industrially supreme Great Britain, and recognizing Britain's position, argued that the optimum condition for the nation's eco- nomic growth and expansion rested upon the \"natural\" flow of trade, a \"natural\" international division of labor, uninhibited by \"artificial\" hindrances. Taken together, Puritanism and Smithian-Manchestrian economics instilled Wilson with the compulsion to serve the strengthening and extending of the politico-economic system he knew in the United States as a positively moral-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN istic commitment, since that would strengthen and extend the sphere of liberty, democracy, prosperity, and Provi- dence, and accorded with natural law. As William Dia- mond observed, such assumptions were to become \"basic\" to Wilson's \"thought on foreign policy.\" 2 Third and finally, the organismic view of society that Wilson derived from Edmund Burke and Walter Bagehot provided him with the concept that whatever social phe- nomena or social system evolved \"naturally\" from the traditions and customs of the past, from the working of natural law through \"irresistible\" social forces, were not only inevitable as prescriptively ordained but morally in- disputable. They represented both the evolution of the genius of human custom and institutions and the assertion of God's will in human affairs. To Burke, whom Wilson revered and assiduously studied, the market economy manifested the working of natural law, which in turn manifested divine law. In Burke, Wilson could find a reverence for the market economy akin to religious awe: 2 William Diamond, The Economic Thought of Woodrow Wil- son (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1943), p. 29. As re- vealed in his life, speeches, and writings, Wilson's concern was to protect the private enterprise system, as beneficent in itself and in its effects, from those dishonest, unscrupulous men who threatened to misuse and pervert it (and from socialists who threatened to abolish it). It was in keeping with his intense commitment to his moral principles that Wilson, early and late in his life, viewed an activist political career as his \"heart's first —primary—ambition and purpose,\" as opposed to pure academic pursuits.

It was therefore only natural that in the 1880s and 1890s and thereafter, far from being a head-in-the- clouds \"idealist,\" Wilson made himself intimately conversant with the concrete political and economic issues of the day."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson and U.S. Liberalism II \"the laws of commerce ... are the laws of nature, and consequently the laws of God,\" Burke had said. 3 American Puritan doctrine, as developed by Jonathan Edwards, had itself become firmly anchored in the natural law of Newton and Locke; it required the intensive study of society's concrete development and condition, in order to compre- hend God's work in the universe. In this respect, Puri- tanism and Burke stood on common ground. Here both religious and secular morality converged upon the affirma- tion of things as they were and as they appeared to be evolving. What was \"natural\" was moral. The part of wis- dom, morality, and statesmanship was to comprehend, affirm, and work for the necessary institutional adjustments to, \"natural\" evolution and \"the well-known laws of value and exchange.\" 4 This evolutionary-positivist or conserva- tive-historicist 5 approach to society served to modify what- ever predilections Wilson may have had for atomized economic relations; it provided him with philosophical ground for rejecting the doctrine of unrestricted competi- tion, as did the institutional economists he encountered at Johns Hopkins in the 1880s, and for affirming, as an inevitable result of the laws of commerce and natural social evolution, the demise of the freely competing entre- preneur at the hands of the large corporation.

No man undertakes to say that the things that have happened by operation of irresistible forces are immoral things. . . .\" 6 To the extent that the characterization of Wilson's mentality as \"moralistic\" connotes Sunday school plati- tudes or Pollyanna ingenuousness, therefore, it is not only irrelevant, but fundamentally misleading. Since Wilson's writings, speeches, policy decisions, and actions simply do not correspond with such \"moralism\" the tendency of those who view his mentality in this manner is to judge both Wilson's utterances and actions, and the great events with which he was concerned, either in terms of a Faustian personality torn between the forces of high idealism and gross materialism, or less charitably, in terms of a sophisti- cated hypocrisy: \". . .

Whether or not in human thought and ideology the two have often failed to be inextricably interrelated, in Wilson they certainly were. A view of ideology that casts morality and ethics into one realm and political economy into another, that sees history as a struggle between the \"ethical\" men and the \"material- istic\" men, between the lofty and the commercialistic, suffers from an inverted economic determinism that over- looks the possibility that commitment to an economic way of life may go hand in hand with the most intense and highly systematized morality; with respect to Wilson, it forgets that just as classical political economy, \"despite its worldly and wanton appearance—is a true moral science, the most moral of the sciences\"; 9 so Puritanism, as the works of R. H. Tawney and Max Weber suggest, despite its heavenly concern, is a truly worldly doctrine. For Wilson, like Burke, ideals and principles, to the extent that they validly applied to society, arose from and satisfied, not rationally deduced abstract precepts, but prac- tical experience with the concrete conditions of society drawn in the light of \"the inviolable understandings of precedent.\" 10 \"Will you never learn this fact,\" he lectured Boston real estate men in January, 1912, \"that you do not make governments by theories?

Laws have never altered the facts; laws have always necessarily expressed the facts; adjusted interests as they have arisen and have changed toward one another. 12 It was the necessity, the \"facts,\" which Wilson recognized that determined his world view. Time and again Wilson emphasized that the facts of modern life to which adjustment was most urgent were economic in character. Indeed, Wilson viewed economic relations as basic to all other social relations. He analyzed conditions in the United States, its troubles and oppor- tunities, as essentially the result of rapid industrialization aggravated by the passing of the continental frontier. He conceived the major issues of his time as \"questions of economic policy chiefly,\" and defined in this manner not 12 The New Freedom (New York, 1914), pp. 33, 34, 35; \"Rich- mond Address\" (February 1, 1912), PPWW, Vol. II, p. 376.

He defined the general welfare or national interest not in terms of abstract reasoning or visionary dreams, or from \"pure\" moral principles, but historically in terms of the \"facts\" of the existing economic structure and business organization. To Wilson, the \"facts\" were that the large corporation and large-scale industry had replaced the indi- vidual entrepreneur and small producing unit as the central and dominant feature of modern capitalism.

This was as true of Wilson as it was of Roosevelt, Taft, George W. Perkins, Elbert H. Gary, and Herbert Croly. In his writings and speeches on the \"trusts,\" Wilson placed particular emphasis upon \"the extraordinary development of corporate organization and administra- tion,\" 19 as the dominant mode of modern capitalist enter- prise, upon the corresponding decline of unrestricted competition and the growth of \"cooperation,\" and further- more, of particular importance, consistent with his overall view, upon the legitimacy of the process, the need to affirm and adjust to it.

As had the corporate leaders themselves who testified before congres- sional committees, what Wilson wanted was \"the certainty of law.\" Within that context, he favored \"as much power as you choose.\" 27 Whether one examines Wilson's thought before or dur- ing his \"New Freedom\" years, it is evident that what is thought of as laissez-faire Jeffersonianism is not one of its characteristics.

We live in a new and strange age and reckon with new affairs alike in economics and politics of which Jefferson knew nothing.\" 29 With respect to the govern- ment's role in particular, as William Diamond summarized the record: \". . . Throughout his political life . . . [Wil- son] was willing to use the government as a positive in- strument in the economic life of the nation. . . .\" 30 In two most basic areas of policy and thought, then, that of the extent of government intervention in the economy and that of the \"trust\" question, Wilson was no more a \"Jeffersonian\" than were Theodore Roosevelt, Edward D. White, Oliver Wendell Holmes, George W. Perkins, or Herbert Croly. If \"Jeffersonian\" is meant to connote a return to an agrarian yeoman republic, or to the regime of unrestricted competition among independent entrepreneurs or small business units, or a government policy of laissez- faire, then much as it obscures more than clarifies in apply- ing the term to any leading twentieth-century figure in United States history, it certainly fails even allegorically to characterize, or provide much insight into, Wilson's thought or policy positions. Accordingly, Wilson's New Freedom years, 1912-14, may be more accurately comprehended not as a break with his past, just as his decision to make commission regulation the core of his trust program may be better understood not as a break with his New Freedom views. Before, during, and after 1914, Wilson's views on the trust question, like those of large corporate spokesmen within the Chicago Association of Commerce, National Civic Federation, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, and like those of 29 \"What Jefferson Would Do,\" ibid., p. 424. 30 Diamond, Economic Thought of Wilson, p. 130."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"22  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN Roosevelt and Bureau of Corporations chiefs James R. Garfield and Herbert K. Smith, embodied the common law-\"rule of reason\" doctrine ultimately handed down by the Supreme Court in its American Tobacco and Standard Oil decisions of 1911. Like the others, Wilson had opposed the Court's earlier decisions prohibiting both \"reasonable\" and \"unreasonable\" restraints of trade; like them his ap- proach affirmed large-scale corporate organization, sought the institutional legitimization of reasonable restraints of trade and the prohibition of unreasonable restraints or \"unfair\" competition, as determined at common law and by judicial precedent, with the public interest as the central consideration. Wilson's position on the trust question as of 1912-14 may be looked upon as a synthesis of the positions of Taft and Roosevelt: on the one hand, acknowledgment of the demise of individualistic, entrepreneurial competition, but the affirmation of and insistence upon reasonable inter- corporate competition; on the other hand, the prevention of \"unfair competition\" and affirmation of \"reasonable\" combination and intercorporate arrangements consistent with the \"public interest\" or \"general welfare,\" under a government regulatory policy rooted in the settled prece- dents and practices of common and civil law jurisprudence, whether enforced by the courts or by an administrative commission or by a combination of both. To cite the fact that Louis D. Brandeis exerted decisive influence in Wilson's acceptance of the trade commission bill as evidence of a basic alteration in Wilson's views on the trust question, is either to overlook Brandeis' public utterances at the time and the program he advocated, or to disregard Wilson's previous writings and statements. Brandeis' position avowedly embodied the Supreme Court's \"rule of reason\" decisions of 1911; he advocated \"reason- able\" restraints of trade (including limitations upon com- petition by trade associations) and the prohibition of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson and U.S. Liberalism 23 \"unfair practices.\" 31 The issue involved in Wilson's aban- doning the Clayton bill was primarily the impracticality of specifying every unfair practice to be proscribed, and the severity with which, in its original form, it threatened to interfere with corporate practices. The \"rule of reason\" decision, on the other hand, provided the general term, \"unfair competition,\" with a recognized meaning at com- mon law as evolved over the past decades in court deci- sions. And after its establishment, when the Federal Trade Commission sought to define \"unfair methods of competi- tion,\" it began by cataloguing all practices that had been found by the courts to be unreasonable or unfair at common law. 32 The trade commission act, although not providing full certainty of law, as Wilson had wished, satisfied the basic elements of his position in removing regulatory powers from the arbitrary decisions of commis- sioners and grounding them in judicial precedent. It should also be noted, within the context of the community of agreement on the trust question between Wilson and large corporate spokesmen, that the circum- stances surrounding the writing of the bill bear no anom- aly. As Arthur S. Link showed, Brandeis and George L. Rublee worked closely together and in consultation with Wilson in drafting the legislation; Rublee actually wrote 31 See, e.g., Brandeis' testimony before House Committee on the Judiciary, Trust Legislation (Ser.

(Brandeis had been an initial member of the Chamber's committee, but retired in favor of Rublee under the press of other affairs.) 34 But all this is not to imply that Wilson \"sold out,\" that he was obliged reluctantly to submit to \"implacable\" forces, or that his views or policies had undergone any basic change. Rather, it is to suggest that, viewed within the context of Wilson's overall thought and programmatic approach, the New Freedom years are not best understood as a distinctive period in his intellectual or political life, nor as \"anti-big business\" in nature or intent, This view may be all the more forcefully substantiated if the interrelationship between the New Freedom legislation of 1913/14 and promotion of United States economic expansion abroad is appreciated. Here again, it may be seen that, consistent with Wilson's previous and subsequent views, the New Freedom was not directed against large corporate developments at home or abroad. 35 33 Link, Wilson: The New Freedom (Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1956), pp. 436-438, 441 (hereafter cited as Link, Wilson, II).

His views in this respect have been sufficiently observed and analyzed elsewhere. 36 The main elements of his thought may be briefly summarized here. As an early adherent of Turner's frontier thesis, Wilson defined the nation's natural political-economic development and its prosperity as a function of westward expansion. With the end of the continental frontier, expansion into world mar- kets with the nation's surplus manufactured goods and capital was, in his view, indispensable to the stability and prosperity of the economy. It was also no more than a natural development in the life of any industrial nation, and, to him, in no way morally invidious, since, in his view, the nation's economic expansion was a civilizing force that carried with it principles of democracy and Christianity as well as bonds of international understand- ing and peace. Given the United States' superior industrial efficiency she would assume supremacy in the world's markets, provided artificial barriers to her economic expan- sion were eliminated. Accordingly, Wilson admired and championed Hay's open-door policy and advocated vigor- to classify Wilson as an exception to the rule. According to Beard, Wilson \"turned a cold shoulder\" to the great economic interests that had \"on the whole, supported and benefited by dollar diplomacy.\" \"From the turn of the century,\" Beard ex- plained, \"the practice of giving aggressive support to the in- terests of American citizens abroad grew until it appeared to attain almost world-wide range and received the authority of a positive official creed in the conception of dollar diplomacy. . . . After a brief setback during the Wilson regime, the pattern was restored again with the return to power of a Republican ad- ministration in 1921. . . .\" But, \"in the main, the policies of President Wilson, both domestic and foreign, ran counter to corporate development and commercial expansion under the impulse of dollar diplomacy, with their accompanying interpre- tations of national interest. . . .\" 36 Diamond, op. cit., pp. 131-161."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"26  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN ous government diplomacy and appropriate government measures to attain the ends in view. Within this broad framework of thought, the application of the expanding-frontier image to economic expansion abroad, assumed a significance more fundamental than the invocation of a romantic metaphor: the West had been developed by the extension of railroads, the opening of mines, the development of agriculture—in short by the extension of the sphere of enterprise and investment that resulted in the widening of the internal market and fed the growth of large-scale industry. Markets for manufactured goods were in this way actively developed, created, in the West, by the metropolitan industrial and finance capitalists, and not without the significant aid of the federal govern- ment. Similarly with such markets abroad: foreign invest- ments and industrial exports were seen by the corporate interests most heavily involved and by like-minded political leaders, such as Wilson, as going hand in hand, centered as their concern was on the needs of an industrial capitalist system in general and heavy industry in particular. Accord- ingly, the idea of \"development\" of agrarian areas in other parts of the world, and \"release of energies,\" is prominent in Wilson's approach to economic expansion abroad. Wilson's emphasis on exports of manufactures, his belief in their indispensability to the nation's prosperity, and his conception that the government should play a leading role in these matters, coincide in every essential respect with the views of the so-called Dollar Diplomatists, and of large corporate spokesmen within the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Asiatic Association, the Pan- American Society, the American Manufacturers Export Association, and the National Foreign Trade Council. In like manner his advocacy of appropriate government mea- sures to encourage an effective merchant marine and ade- quate international banking facilities flowed from this common concern for expanding the economic frontier; and his support of a low tariff was in large part informed by his"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson and U.S. Liberalism 27 belief that it was necessary to the nation's assumption of its proper role in world economic affairs. But these were not merely the views of a supposedly \"early\" Wilson, later to be abandoned by the New Free- dom Wilson; on the contrary, he carried them most em- phatically, along with programmatic proposals, into his presidential campaign of 1912. Wilson's consistent theme, in this respect, during his bid for the presidency, is sum- marized in his address accepting the Democratic Party's presidential nomination: \". . . Our industries have ex- panded to such a point that they will burst their jackets if they cannot find a free outlet to the markets of the world . . . Our domestic markets no longer suffice. We need foreign markets. ...\" The alternative, as he had previ- ously put it, was \"a congestion that will operate calami- tously upon the economic conditions of the country.\" The economic imperatives, therefore, required institutional ad- justments on the governmental and private business levels to break an outmoded \"chrysalis,\" in order to \"relieve the plethora,\" and \"use the energy of the [nation's] capital.\" They also pointed to \"America's economic supremacy\" (a phrase that Wilson shared with Brooks Adams): \". . . if we are not going to stifle economically, we have got to find our way out into the great international exchanges of the world\"; the nation's \"irresistible energy . . . has got to be released for the commercial conquest of the world,\" for \"making ourselves supreme in the world from an economic point of view.\" He stressed three major reforms to meet the new necessities of the time—the downward revision of the tariff, the development of a strong merchant marine (\"The nation that wants foreign commerce must have the arms of commerce\"), and laws permitting foreign branch banking tied to a commercial-acceptance system (\". . . this abso- lutely essential function of international trade . . .\"). 37 3 7 See in particular his speeches, \"Efficiency\" (January 27, 1912), PPWW, Vol. II, pp. 357-360, 372-375, 38o; \"The"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"28  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN Wilson's concern for the promotion of foreign trade and investment found expression in some of his key appoint- ments upon assuming the presidency.

As a New York manufac- turer of iron and steel products he spent many years abroad developing markets, and as a \"business statesman\" much of his time expounding the theme of expansion and downward revision of the tariff. Like Wilson he had been a gold-Democrat, and the views of the two men were strik- ingly similar in matters of trade expansion and the tariff. Indeed, Wilson, in January, 1912, acknowledged that \"I primed myself on Mr. Redfield's [tariff] speeches.\" 41 Of greater significance, indicating Redfield's prominence in the corporate community and the degree to which he repre- sented corporate opinion, Redfield had been president of the American Manufacturers Export Association (orga- nized in 1910), which, to use Robert A.

In 1910 industrial corporations organized the American Manufacturers Ex- port Association (AMEA); in 1912 these corporations, along with other business organizations, such as the Amer- ican Asiatic Association (AAA), established the United States Chamber of Commerce; and in 1914 the AMEA, the AAA, and the Pan-American Society joined together to form the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC).

It was generally recognized in business circles that the large industrial corporations were most suited to successful export trade, and that the rapid rise in exports of manufac- turers from the late 1890s to 1914 had been due largely to the operations of these corporations. The large corpora- tions enjoyed low unit costs necessary for competition in world markets, particularly in the capital and durable goods industries. Their superior reserves and intimate con- nections with the great financial institutions enabled them to carry the expense of foreign sales promotion, offer attractive foreign credit facilities, and reap the benefits of foreign loans and concessions, all indispensable to an expanding and stable export trade. It was these corporations that were most intimately involved in the \"development\" of agrarian nations. Since the export of manufactured goods was considered primary in maintaining the nation's inter- national exchanges, in liquidating foreign debts, and in guaranteeing domestic prosperity, the success of any busi- ness or governmental policy looking to the promotion of export trade and the achievement of these related objec- tives appeared to stand or fall with the large corporation.

By a vote of 538 to 67 the Chamber's mem- bership approved this specific recommendation (as did the National Foreign Trade Convention in May, 1914), along with the broader one supporting a trade commission act. 67 Accordingly, in the drafting of the act, which Rublee wrote, it was this Chamber committee that inserted word for word section 6(h), which authorized the trade commis- sion to investigate world trade conditions and submit appropriate recommendations to Congress. 68 With Rublee and Hurley appointed by Wilson as two of the agency's five commissioners, the FTC undertook and completed in its first year of operation four investigations, three of which dealt with foreign trade conditions. 69 One of these resulted in the two-volume Report on Cooperation in American Export Trade, which recommended that Congress pass what was to become the Export Trade (Webb-Pomerene) Act of 1918 permitting cartels in the export trade, a bill that Wilson strongly supported.

The two laws, it should be noted, were passed against the background of a trend among large industrial and financial interests, which had visibly emerged at least a decade before, toward tariff and banking structures oriented {inter alia) to their foreign trade and investment requirements.

It was part of the New Freedom program; but the heathens were not necessarily the large corporations. It was part of an attack on \"special privilege\" conceived to be in conflict with the national interest understood in terms of the conditions of modern times; but it was the special privilege cherished by smaller and by nonindustrial interests, no longer needed by the larger interests as export trade became increasingly more important to them. Aside from its immediate intent to stimulate export trade, the tariff, consistent with Wilson's views, sought to enforce industrial efficiency by inviting worldwide competi- tion, which would result in making United States industry and finance a more formidable competitor in world mar- kets. The larger industrial interests could withstand, and expect to fatten on, such competition, but not the smaller. Those items placed on the free list by the tariff were, in the majority, articles of food, clothing, and raw materials, industries occupied by the \"little man.\" Large corporations engaged in the capital and durable goods industries, and most heavily involved in the export trade so far as manu- factures were concerned, could approve this provision, because should the tariff have the intended effect, it would operate to keep wage levels down, reduce costs of mate- rials, and in the process enable more effective competition in world markets, aside from increasing the profit rate. The issue was analogous to the great Corn Law debates in England during the previous century, where the industrial- ists sought to abolish import duties at the expense of producers of food and raw stuffs.

Of further aid to such competition, moreover, the Underwood Tariff granted drawbacks on exported items comprised in part or in whole of imported materials subject to import duties. 74 In effect, the Underwood Tariff strengthened the position of the larger corporations as against the smaller, and as against producers of agricultural materials. In this case, legal reform served the interest of those seeking to buttress the socioeconomic status quo, while adherence to estab- lished law and institutions rallied those whose interest lay in forestalling the onward rush of that status quo. Accord- ingly, the greatest danger to the Underwood bill's down- ward revisions while pending in Congress \"came from a horde of lobbyists,\" among whom the \"owners and man- agers of industries that produced the great bulk of Ameri- can industrial products were unconcerned and took no part. . . .\" As Link concluded, the Underwood duties assumed their greatest significance \"in so far as they reflected a lessening of the pressure from the large indus- trial interests for a McKinley type of protection.\" 75 It is understandable, therefore, that among the congressional critics of the Underwood Tariff, as with the reserve act and Taussig's terms, a \"competitive tariff.\" F.

It is not meant to imply that the corporate community had no criticisms of the Underwood Tariff or Federal Reserve Act; but large corporate interests in particular viewed the new tariff either as a worthwhile experiment or more positively as sound policy; and business opinion overwhelmingly viewed the reserve act as basically sound, in need of perfecting amendments, rather than as a mea- sure directed against their interests.

Otherwise, with respect to the manner of adminis- tering the system, the division lay not between Wilson and the \"small\" interests on the one side and \"big business\" on the other: the large corporate interests themselves were divided, particularly, the evidence indicates, along indus- trial and financial lines.

The large corporation, in this view, and the restriction of competition by corresponding forms of \"cooperation,\" were the inevitable product of natural economic develop- ment. The trust, however, was an artificial contrivance of predatory design, deliberately created by unscrupulous businessmen for undue ends. Accordingly, Wilson believed that although \"... the elaboration of business upon a great cooperative scale is characteristic of our time and has come about by the natural operation of western civiliza- tion,\" this was different from saying that the trusts were inevitable. . . . Big business is no doubt to a large extent neces- sary and natural. The development of business upon a great scale, upon a great scale of cooperation, is in- evitable, and ... is probably desirable.

His formula was fair competition and impartial access to credit at home, and expansion of the economic frontier abroad, upon the assumption that the wider the market and the more impersonal its conditions, the more room and opportunity for the little man to coexist side by side with the big. The very conditions of industrial production and of foreign economic expansion, however, made the little man, as an independent entrepre- neur, increasingly irrelevant to the national economy, ex- cept in peripheral spheres of services and distribution. Theodore Roosevelt sought to meet this disturbing reality by acknowledging it and insisting upon equal opportunity for every young man to rise within the established corpo- rate structures. Although similarly insisting upon such equality, Wilson refused to concede the irrelevance of the little man; but his refusal was not a matter of sentimental- ity: it stemmed from his fear that given a growing irrele- vance of little men in the nation's economy, fewer and fewer people would retain a stake in the capitalist system, and more and more would lose hope for betterment under capitalism and turn toward socialism or other forms of radicalism. 84 As such, the Wilsonian and Rooseveltian 84 As Wilson advised leading businessmen in his address at the Annual Banquet of the Economic Club in New York (May 23, 1912) P P W W, Vol. II, pp. 446, 449-451: \". . .

Link, Wilsonian Progressivism, as applied and developed during Wilson's two terms as Presi- dent, from 1913 to 1921, can be divided into two periods: the first, the period of the New Freedom, characterized by government attempts to regulate and stand in hostile pos- ture apart from big business, and directed at restoring some semblance of a laissez-faire, free-competition social order; the second, characterized by a government policy of co- operation with big business and active regulatory interven- tion in the economy. The divide, according to this view, lay somewhere around November, 1914 (though at points the divide is rolled back to early 1914, as a response to the continuing depression, leaving scarcely a year to the New Freedom phase). Thus, it is argued, the New Freedom was capable of serving the cause of Progressivism for only a short time; Progressivism gained new life after November, 1914, through the abandonment of the New Freedom and the move toward Herbert Croly's and Theodore Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism.\" If Wilson is properly understood in terms of the widely current evolutionary-positivistic world view that he shared alike with leading industrial and finance capitalists and with prominent politicians and intellectuals within the bipartisan Progressive movement, and if the approaches taken by his Administration to both foreign and domestic affairs are viewed as basically interrelated, rather than compartmentalized, as affecting each other, rather than operating in isolated spheres, then it is of greater analytical value to view the attitude assumed by Wilson and his Administration toward \"business\" before and after Novem- ber, 1914, as undergoing consistent development, rather than fundamental change.

Large corporate production appeared as the vehicle of domestic material progress; foreign economic expansion, considered a deci- sive condition of such production, promised to carry \"civil- ization,\" bourgeois-liberal ideas and institutions, and a better way of life, to the agrarian areas of the world, particularly as \"development\" of natural resources in those areas was considered essential to such expansion. It no more occurred to such liberals as Wilson than it did to the so-called Dollar Diplomatists before him, or than it does today to the \"internationalist\" liberals, that invest- ment in, and ownership of, other nations' resources, rail- roads, and industry, by United States capitalists, consti- tuted imperialism or exploitation. Imperialism to them meant British- and European-style colonialism or exclu- sive spheres of interest; exploitation meant unscrupulous gouging, exorbitantly profitable concessions gained by un- due influence with corrupt government officials, and the like, in short, \"unfair practices\" analogous to those charac- teristics that distinguished the trust from the large corpora- tion in domestic affairs. Open-door expansion, on the other hand, appeared to them as simply the implementation of the natural international division of labor between the industrialized and agrarian nations; it meant mutually beneficial (and beneficent) business relationships and trade; it meant the assumption by the United States of its natural place in the world economy vis-a-vis the other industrial nations, by the elimination of \"artificial\" impedi- ments to the operation of the laws of competitive com- merce; it meant \"free trade.\" 85 85 See, e.g., Wilson's \"Be Worthy of the Men of 1776\" (July 4, 1914), P P W W, Vol. Ill, pp. 142-143: \"The Department of State ... is constantly called upon to back up the commer- cial . . . and the industrial enterprises of the United States in foreign countries, and it at one time went so far in that direc-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"60  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN In the Wilsonian manner, former president Truman re- cently remarked: \"The Open Door policy is not imperial- ism; it is free trade.\" Unfortunately, the bourgeois-liberal mind seems unable to understand how any transaction that involves the exchange of equivalent for equivalent can carry with it any quality of injustice or exploitation. In the economic realm, morality and justice are defined as ex- change at value, so long as it is devoid of any element of extra-pecuniary coercion; in more sophisticated ideological terms, morality and justice correspond with natural law. But it is precisely in the relationship defined by natural law, precisely in the exchange of equivalent for equivalent (assuming the free and competitive exchange of equiva- lents in the first place, though this is often not the case), that the exploitation, the injustice, the immorality, from the point of view of the agrarian peoples, resides. For, whereas the relationship is reified by the liberal mind as purely an exchange of goods, a confrontation of things, of private properties, what is really involved is a relationship between human beings. Concern for the nicely balanced exchange of things according to their market value—\"a fair field and no favor\"—blinds the liberal mind to the real rela- tionship between people, of which the exchange of goods is tion that all its diplomacy came to be designated as 'dollar di- plomacy.' . . .

Historians who have studied Wilson appear to harbor guilt feelings about capitalism: a policy based upon con- siderations of the economic imperatives of capitalism is sordid, immoral, or amoral; a policy based upon noneco- nomic principle is moralistic. The corporate and political policy-makers of the United States, Wilson included, have had no such guilt feelings or compulsion to make such a division in their thinking. To them there was (and is) nothing immoral about capitalism; it embraces the highest morality. The strength and spread of morality appear as the function of the strength and spread of capitalism. His- torians, however, disregarding the imperatives of modern capitalism, while assuming its existence all the same, seem to have created an ideal construct of what liberalism ought to be, arbitrarily imputing to it certain characteristics of a transcendent nature and withholding from it others, par- ticularly those relating to the affairs of political economy. It is an academic, idealized liberalism, not the responsible political liberalism as it operates as a functional ideology outside the university walls; it is a liberalism from which historians have written history in the manner of advice, consent, and dissent, rather than history that analyzes the nature of liberal ideology as it operates and appears in the hurly-burly of political economy. Accordingly, historians have tended to appraise the nature of the Wilsonian liberal (or Progressive) movement by deduction from, and in comparison with, the supposed nature of its ideology, instead of basing their analyses on an empirical study of the movement and comprehending the ideology of its leaders as emerging from and interacting with that move- ment and its adversaries.

The point raised here, however, is not a quarrel about whether Wilson was in fact a liberal or a Progressive; on the contrary, it is submitted that a suc- cessful, comprehensive effort at analyzing precisely what Wilsonian liberalism or Progressivism was (and modern United States liberalism in general) has yet to be made. It would be conducive to a more impartial and compre- hensive understanding of Wilson and Wilsonianism to discard as a tool of analysis both the New Freedom-New Nationalism formula and the \"moralism\" versus \"commer- cialism\" presumption. This approach sees behind the New Freedom the shadow of a misconstrued Brandeis, who is taken inaccurately to symbolize an anti-big business pro- gram for the restoration of some sort of laissez-faire, free- competition society; more accurately, it sees behind the New Nationalism the shadow of Croly as represented in his book, The Promise of American Life (New York: Dutton Paperbacks, 1963). At the outset, and only at the outset, it may be more pertinent and analytically suggestive to a reevaluation of Wilson and Wilsonianism, to see instead the shadow of Croly-the-adolescent behind the earlier years of Wilson's presidency, Croly-the-strapping-young-man be- hind the later (and lingering into the 1920s), with Croly- the-nearly-mature biding his time until the advent of the New Deal. In view of the present \"national purpose\" campaign of corporate spokesmen, liberal political and intellectual leaders, the Luce publications and The New York Times, short of a basic reordering of United States society, Croly-the-mature may yet arrive, and then the nation will surely be in need of a new freedom."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I MURRAY N. ROTHBARD More than any other single period, World War I was the critical watershed for the American business system. It was a \"war collectivism,\" a totally planned economy run largely by big-business interests through the instrumentality of the central government, which served as the model, the precedent, and the inspiration for state corporate capi- talism for the remainder of the twentieth century. That inspiration and precedent emerged not only in the United States, but also in the war economies of the major com- batants of World War I. War collectivism showed the big- business interests of the Western world that it was possible to shift radically from the previous, largely free-market, capitalism to a new order marked by strong government, and extensive and pervasive government intervention and planning, for the purpose of providing a network of sub- sidies and monopolistic privileges to business, and espe- cially to large business, interests. In particular, the economy could be cartelized under the aegis of government, with prices raised and production fixed and restricted, in the classic pattern of monopoly; and military and other gov- ernment contracts could be channeled into the hands of favored corporate producers.

In many ways, the new order was a striking reversion to old-fashioned mercantilism, with its aggressive imperialism and nationalism, its pervasive militarism, and its giant network of subsidies and monopolistic privileges to large business interests. In its twentieth-century form, of course, the New Mercantilism was industrial rather than mercantile, since the industrial revolution had intervened to make manufacturing and industry the dominant economic form. But there was a more significant difference in the New Mercantilism. The original mercantilism had been brutally frank in its class rule, and in its scorn for the average worker and consumer. 1 Instead, the new dispensation cloaked the new form of rule in the guise of promotion of the overall national interest, of the welfare of the workers through the new representation for labor, and of the common good of all citizens. Hence the importance, for providing a much-needed popular legitimacy and support, of the new ideology of twentieth-century liberalism, which sanctioned and glorified the new order. In contrast to the older laissez-faire liberalism of the previous century, the new liberalism gained popular sanction for the new system by proclaiming that it differed radically from the old, exploitative mercantilism in its advancement of the welfare of the whole society. And in return for this ideological 1 On the attitudes of the mercantilists toward labor, see Edgar S.

For their part, the liberal intellectuals acquired not only prestige and a modicum of power in the new order, they also achieved the satisfaction of believing that this new system of government intervention was able to transcend the weaknesses and the social conflicts that they saw in the two major alternatives: laissez-faire capitalism or prole- tarian, Marxian socialism. The intellectuals saw the new order as bringing harmony and cooperation to all classes on behalf of the general welfare, under the aegis of big government.

Thus, an early enthusiast for war mobilization was the United States Chamber of Commence, which had been a leading champion of indus- trial cartelization under the aegis of the federal government since its formation in 1912. The Chamber's monthly, The Nation's Business, foresaw in mid-1916 that a mobilized economy would bring about a sharing of power and re- sponsibility between government and business. And the chairman of the U.S. Chamber's Executive Committee on National Defense wrote to the du Ponts, at the end of 1916, of his expectation that \"this munitions question would seem to be the greatest opportunity to foster the new spirit\" of cooperation between government and industry. 3 The first organization to move toward economic mobili- zation for war was the Committee on Industrial Prepared- ness, which in 1916 grew out of the Industrial Preparedness Committee of the Naval Consulting Board, a committee of industrial consultants to the Navy dedicated to considering the ramifications of an expanding American Navy. Charac- teristically, the new CIP was a closely blended public- private organization, officially an arm of the federal gov- ernment but financed solely by private contributions. More- over, the industrialist members of the committee, working patriotically without fee, were thereby able to retain their private positions and incomes. Chairman of the CIP, and a dedicated enthusiast for industrial mobilization, was Howard E. Coffin, vice-president of the important Hudson Motor Co. of Detroit. Under Coffin's direction, the CIP organized a national inventory of thousands of industrial facilities for munitions-making.

Never before was there such a focusing of knowledge of the vast field of American industry, commerce, and transportation. Never was there such an approach to omniscience in the business affairs of a continent. 12 Big-business leaders permeated the WIB structure from the board itself down to the commodity sections. Thus, Vice-Chairman Alexander Legge came from International Harvester Co.; businessman Robert S. Brookings was the major force in insisting on price-fixing; George N. Peek, in charge of finished products, had been vice-president of Deere & Co., a leading farm equipment manufacturer. Robert S. Lovett, in charge of priorities, was chairman of the board of Union Pacific Railroad, and J. Leonard Replogle, Steel Administrator, had been president of the American Vanadium Co. Outside of the direct WIB struc- ture, Daniel Willard of the Baltimore & Ohio was in charge of the nation's railroads, and big businessman Herbert C. Hoover was the \"Food Czar.\" In the granting of war contracts, there was no nonsense about competitive bidding. Competition in efficiency and cost was brushed aside, and the industry-dominated WIB handed out contracts as it saw fit. Any maverick individualistic firm that disliked the man- dates and orders of the WIB was soon crushed between the coercion wielded by government and the collaborating opprobrium of his organized business colleagues. Thus, Grosvenor Clarkson writes: Individualistic American industrialists were aghast when they realized that industry had been drafted, much as manpower had been. . . . Business willed its own domination, forged its bonds, and policed its own subjection. There were bitter and stormy protests here and there, especially from those industries that were !2 Clarkson, op. cit., p. 63."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 75 curtailed or suspended. . . . [But] the rents in the garment of authority were amply filled by the docile and cooperative spirit of industry. The occasional ob- structor fled from the mandates of the Board only to find himself ostracized by his fellows in industry. 13 One of the most important instrumentalities of wartime collectivism was the Conservation Division of the WIB, an agency again consisting largely of leaders in manufactur- ing. The Conservation Division had begun as the Commer- cial Economy Board of the CND, the brainchild of its first chairman, Chicago businessman A. W. Shaw. The Board, or Division, would suggest industrial economies, and en- courage the industry concerned to establish cooperative regulations. The Board's regulations were supposedly \"vol- untary,\" a voluntarism enforced by \"the compulsion of trade opinion—which automatically policed the observance of the recommendations.\" For \"a practice adopted by the overwhelming consent and even insistence of ... [a man's] fellows, especially when it bears the label of patriotic service in a time of emergency, is not lightly to be disregarded.\" 14 In this way, in the name of wartime \"conservation,\" the Conservation Division set out to rationalize, standardize, and cartelize industry in a way that would, hopefully, continue permanently after the end of the war. Arch W. Shaw summed up the Division's task as follows: to drasti- cally reduce the number of styles, sizes, etc., of the prod- ucts of industry; to eliminate various styles and varieties; to standardize sizes and measures. That this ruthless and thoroughgoing suppression of competition in industry was not thought of as a purely wartime measure is made clear in this passage by Grosvenor Clarkson: The World War was a wonderful school. ... It showed us how so many things may be bettered that 15 Ibid., pp. 154, 159. 14 Ibid., p. 215."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"7<5  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN we are at a loss where to begin with permanent utilization of what we know.

It is, perhaps, too much to hope that there will be any general gain in time of peace from the triumphant experiment of the Conservation Division. Yet now the world needs to economize as much as in war. 15 Looking forward to future cartelization, Clarkson declared that such peacetime \"economizing . . . implies such a close and sympathetic affiliation of competitive industries as is hardly possible under the decentralization of business that is compelled by our antitrust statutes.\" Bernard Baruch's biographer summarized the lasting results of the compulsory \"conservation\" and standardiza- tion as follows: Wartime conservation had reduced styles, varieties, and colors of clothing. It had standardized sizes. . . . It had outlawed 250 different types of plow models in the U.S., to say nothing of 755 types of drills . . . mass production and mass distribution had be- come the law of the land. . . .

Furthermore, these committees dealt with over three hundred \"war service committees\" of industry appointed by the respective industrial groupings under the aegis of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. It is no wonder that in this cozy atmosphere, there was a great deal of harmony between business and government.

War is the stern teacher that is driving home the lesson of cooperative effort. 21 The result of all this new-found harmony within each industry, and between industry and government, was to \"substitute cooperation for competition.\" Competition for government orders was virtually nonexistent, and \"compe- tition in price was practically done away with by Govern- ment action. Industry was for the time in ... a golden age of harmony,\" and freed from the menace of business losses. 22 One of the crucial functions of wartime planning was price-fixing, set in the field of industrial commodities by the Price-Fixing Committee of the War Industries Board.

In fact, however, the government set the price in each industry at such a rate as to guarantee a \"fair profit\" to the high-cost producers, thereby conferring a large degree of privilege and high profits upon the lower- cost firms. 23 Clarkson admitted that this system was a tremendous invigoration of big business and hard on small business. The large and efficient producers made larger profits than normally and many of the smaller concerns fell below their customary returns. 24 But the higher-cost firms were largely content with their \"fair profit\" guarantee. The attitude of the Price-Fixing Committee was reflected in the statement of its Chairman, Robert S. Brookings, a retired lumber magnate, addressed to the nickel industry: \"We are not in an attitude of envying you your profits; we are more in the attitude of justifying them if we can. That is the way we approach these things.\" 25 Typical of the price-fixing operation was the situation in the cotton textile industry. Chairman Brookings reported in April, 1918, that the cotton goods committee had decided to \"get together in a friendly way\" to try to \"stabilize the market.\" Brookings appended the feeling of the larger cotton manufacturers that it was better to fix a high long- 23 See George P.

New York at 23^ cents per pound. The Utah Copper Co., which produced over 8 percent of the total copper output, had estimated costs of 11.8 cents per pound. In this way, Utah Copper was guaranteed nearly 100 percent profit on costs.

The enthusiasm was a product of the resulting stabilization of prices, the ironing out of market fluctuations, and the fact that prices were almost always set by mutual consent of government and the repre- sentatives of each industry. It is no wonder that Harry A. Wheeler, president of the United States Chamber of Com- merce, wrote in the summer of 1917 that war \"is giving business the foundation for the kind of cooperative effort that alone can make the U.S. economically efficient.\" Or that the head of American Telephone and Telegraph hailed the perfecting of a \"coordination to ensure complete co- operation not only between the Government and the com- panies, but between the companies themselves.\" The war- time cooperative planning was working so well, in fact, opined the chairman of the board of Republic Iron and Steel in early 1918, that it should be continued in peacetime as well. 27 The vitally important steel industry is an excellent ex- ample of the workings of war collectivism. The hallmark of the closely knit control of the steel industry was the close \"cooperation\" between government and industry, a co- operation in which Washington decided on broad policy, and then left it up to Judge Elbert Gary, head of the leading steel producer, United States Steel, to implement the policy within the industry. Gary selected a committee representing the largest steel producers to help him run the industry. A willing ally was present in J. Leonard Replogle, head of American Vanadium Co. and chief of the Steel Division of the WIB. Replogle shared the long-standing desire of Gary and the steel industry for industrial carteli- 26 Weinstein, op. cit., pp. 224-225. 27 Melvin I.

Unsurprisingly, Gary was delighted with his new powers in directing the steel industry, and urged that he be given total power \"to thoroughly mobilize and if necessary to commandeer.\" And Iron Age, the magazine of the iron and steel industry, exulted that it has apparently taken the most gigantic war in all his- tory to give the idea of cooperation any such place in the general economic program as the country's steel manufacturers sought to give it in their own industry nearly ten years ago with the short-lived entente cordiale between Judge Gary and President Roosevelt. 28 It is true that wartime relations between government and steel companies were sometimes strained, but the strain and the tough threat of government commandeering of resources was generally directed at smaller firms, such as Crucible Steel, which had stubbornly refused to accept government contracts. 29 In the steel industry, in fact, it was the big steelmakers— U.S. Steel, Bethlehem, Republic, etc.—who, early in the war, had first urged government price-fixing, and they had to prod a sometimes confused government to adopt what eventually became the government's program. The main reason was that the big steel producers, happy at the enormous increase of steel prices in the market as a result of wartime demand, were anxious to stabilize the market at 28 Urofsky, op. cit., pp. 153-157. In his important study of busi- ness-government relations in the War Industries Board, Pro- fessor Robert Cuff has concluded that federal regulation of in- dustry was shaped by big-business leaders, and that relations between government and big business were smoothest in those industries, such as steel, whose industrial leaders had already committed themselves to seeking government-sponsored carteli- zation.

The government-steel industry price-fixing agreement of September, 1917, was therefore hailed by John A. Topping, president of Republic Steel, as follows: The steel settlement will have a wholesome effect on the steel business because the principle of cooperative regulation has been established with Government ap- proval. Of course, present abnormal profits will be substantially reduced but a runaway market condition has been prevented and prosperity extended. . . . Furthermore, stability in future values should be con- served. 30 Furthermore, the large steel firms were happy to use the fixed prices as a rationale for imposing controls and stabil- ity upon wages, which were also beginning to rise. The smaller steel manufacturers, on the other hand, often with higher costs, and who had not been as prosperous before the war, opposed price-fixing because they wished to take full advantage of the short-run profit bonanza brought about by the war. 31 Under this regime, the steel industry achieved the highest level of profits in its history, averaging twenty- five percent per year for the two years of war. Some of the smaller steel companies, benefiting from their lower total capitalization, did almost twice as well. 32 The most thoroughgoing system of price controls during the war was enforced not by the WIB but by the separate Food Administration, over which Herbert Clark Hoover presided as \"Food Czar.\" The official historian of wartime 30 In Iron Age (September 27, 1917).

The Food Administration was established without legal authorization, and then a bill backed by Hoover was put through Congress to give the system the full force of law. Hoover was also given the power to requisition \"necessaries,\" to seize plants for government operation, and to regulate or prohibit exchanges. The key to the Food Administration's system of control was a vast network of licensing. Instead of direct control over food, the FA was given the absolute power to issue licenses for any and all divisions of the food industry, and to set the conditions for keeping the license. Every dealer, every manufacturer, distributor, and warehouser of food commodities was required by Hoover to maintain its fed- eral license. A notable feature introduced by Hoover in his reign as Food Czar was the mobilization of a vast network of citizen volunteers as a mass of eager participants in enforc- ing his decrees. Thus, Herbert Hoover was perhaps the first American politician to realize the potential—in gaining mass acceptance and in enforcing government decrees—in the mobilizing of masses through a torrent of propaganda to serve as volunteer aides to the government bureaucracy. Mobilization proceeded to the point of inducing the public to brand as a virtual moral leper anyone dissenting from Mr. Hoover's edicts. Thus: The basis of all ... control exercised by the Food Administration was the educational work which pre- ceded and accompanied its measures of conservation and regulation. Mr. Hoover was committed thoroughly 33 Paul Willard Garrett, Government Control Over Prices (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1920), p. 42."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"84  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN to the idea that the most effective method to control foods was to set every man, woman, and child in the country at the business of saving food. . . . The country was literally strewn with millions of pam- phlets and leaflets designed to educate the people to the food situation. No war board at Washington was advertised as widely as the U.S. Food Administration. There were Food Administration insignia for the coat lapel, store window, the restaurant, the train, and the home. A real stigma was placed upon the person who was not loyal to Food Administration edicts through pressure by the schools, churches, women's clubs, pub- lic libraries, merchants' associations, fraternal organi- zations, and other social groups. 34 The method by which the Food Administration imposed price control was its requirement that its licensees should receive \"a reasonable margin of profit.\" This \"reasonable margin\" was interpreted as a margin over and above each producer's costs, and this cost-plus \"reasonable profit\" for each dealer became the rule of price control. The program was touted to the public as a means of keeping profits and food prices down. Although the Administration certainly wished to stabilize prices, the goal was also and more importantly to cartelize. Industry and government worked together to make sure that individual maverick competitors did not get out of line; prices in general were to be set at a level to guarantee a \"reasonable\" profit to everyone. The goal was not lower prices, but uniform, stabilized, non- competitive prices for all. The goal was far more to keep prices up than to keep them down. Indeed, any overly greedy competitor who tried to increase his profits above prewar levels by cutting his prices, was dealt with most severely by the Food Administration. Let us consider two of the most important food-control programs during World War I: wheat and sugar. Wheat price control, the most important program, came in the 34 Garrett, op. cit., p. 56."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 85 wake of wartime demand, which had pushed wheat prices up very rapidly to their highest level in the history of the United States. Thus, wheat increased by one dollar a bushel in the course of two months at the start of the war, reaching the unheard of price of three dollars a bushel. Control came in the wake of agitation that government must step in to thwart \"speculators\" by fixing maximum prices on wheat. Yet, under pressure by the agriculturists, the government program fixed by statute, not maximum prices for wheat but minima; the Food Control Act of 1917 fixed a minimum price of two dollars a bushel for the next year's wheat crop. Not content with this special sub- sidy, the President proceeded to raise the minimum to two dollars and twenty-six cents a bushel in mid-1918, a figure that was then the precise market price for wheat. This increased minimum effectively fixed the price of wheat for the duration of the war. Thus, the government made sure that the consumers could not possibly benefit from any fall in wheat prices. To enforce the artificially high price of wheat, Herbert Hoover established the Grain Corporation, \"headed by practical grain men,\" which purchased the bulk of the wheat crop in the United States at the \"fair price,\" and then resold the crop to the nation's flour mills at the same price. To keep the millers happy, the Grain Corporation guaranteed them against any possible losses from unsold stocks of wheat or flour. Moreover, each mill was guaran- teed that its relative position in the flour industry would be maintained throughout the war. In this way, the flour indus- try was successfully cartelized through the instrument of government. Those few mills who balked at the cartel arrangement were dealt with handily by the Food Adminis- tration; as Garrett put it: \"their operations . . . were reasonably well controlled ... by the license require- ments.\" 35 The excessively high prices of wheat and flour also 35 ibid., p. 66."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"86  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN meant artificially high costs to the bakers. They, in turn, were taken under the cozy cartel umbrella by being re- quired, in the name of \"conservation,\" to mix inferior products with wheat flour at a fixed ratio. Each baker was of course delighted to comply with a requirement that he make inferior products, which he knew was also being enforced upon his competitors. Competition was also cur- tailed by the Food Administration's compulsory standardi- zation of the sizes of bread loaves, and by prohibiting price- cutting through discounts or rebates to particular cus- tomers—the classic path toward the internal breakup of any cartel. 36 In the particular case of sugar, there was a much more sincere effort to keep down prices—due to the fact that the United States was largely an importer rather than a pro- ducer of sugar. Herbert Hoover and the Allied govern- ments duly formed an International Sugar Committee, which undertook to buy all of their countries' sugar, largely from Cuba, at an artificially low price, and then to allocate the raw sugar to the various refiners. Thus, the Allied governments functioned as a giant buying cartel to lower the price of their refiners' raw material. Herbert Hoover instigated the plan for the International Sugar Committee, and the United States government ap- pointed the majority of the five-man committee. As Chair- man of the committee, Hoover selected Earl Babst, president of the powerful American Sugar Refining Co., and the other American members also represented refiner interests. The ISC promptly fixed a sharp reduction of the price of sugar: lowering the New York price of Cuban raw sugar from its high market price of six and three-quarter cents per pound in the summer of 1917 to six cents per pound. When the Cubans understandably balked at this artificially forced price reduction of their cash crop, the 36 ibid., p. 73."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 87 United States State Department and the Food Administra- tion collaborated to coerce the Cuban government into agreement. Somehow, the Cubans were unable to obtain import licenses for needed wheat and coal from the United States Food Administration, and the result was a severe shortage of bread, flour, and coal in Cuba. Finally, the Cubans capitulated in mid-January, 1918, and the import licenses from the United States were rapidly forthcom- ing. 37 Cuba was also induced to prohibit all sugar exports except to the International Sugar Committee. Apparently, Mr. Babst insured an extra bonus to his American Sugar Refining Company; for, shortly, officials of competing American refineries were to testify before Congress that this company had particularly profited from the activities of the International Sugar Committee and from the price that it fixed on Cuban sugar. 38 Although the American government pursued with great diligence the goal of pushing down raw material prices for United States refiners, it also realized that it could not force down the price of raw sugar too low, since the government had to consider the marginal United States cane and beet-sugar producers, who had to receive their duly appointed \"fair return.\" Jointly to harmonize and subsidize both the sugar refiners and the sugar growers in the United States, Mr. Hoover established a Sugar Equaliza- tion Board that would simultaneously keep the price of sugar low to Cuba while keeping it high enough for the American producers. The Board accomplished this feat by buying the Cuban sugar at the fixed low price and then reselling the crop to the refiners at a higher price to cover the American producers. 39 The result of the artificially low prices for sugar was, inevitably, to create a severe sugar shortage, by reducing 37 See Robert F.

The result was that sugar consumption was then severely restricted by federal rationing of sugar. It is not surprising that the food industries were delighted with the wartime control program. Expressing the spirit of the entire war-collectivist regime, Herbert Hoover, in the words of Paul Garrett: maintained, as a cardinal policy from the beginning, a very close and intimate contact with the trade. The men, whom he chose to head his various commodity sections and responsible positions, were in a large measure tradesmen. . . . The determination of the policies of control within each branch of the food in- dustry was made in conference with the tradesmen of that branch. ... It might be said . . . that the framework of food control, as of raw material control, was built upon agreements with the trade. The en- forcement of the agreements once made, moreover, was intrusted in part to the cooperation of consti- tuted trade organizations. The industry itself was made to feel responsible for the enforcement of all rules and regulations. 40 Also separate from the War Industries Board were the nation's railroads, which received the greatest single minis- tration of government dictation as compared to any other industry. The railroads, in fact, were seized and operated directly by the federal government. As soon as the United States entered the war, the Administration urged the railroads to unite as one in behalf of the war effort. The railroads were delighted to comply, and quickly formed what became known as the Railroads' War Board, promising faithfully to pursue a goal that they had long sought in peacetime: to cease competitive activ- ities and to coordinate railroad operations. 41 Daniel Wil- 40 Ibid., pp. 55-56. 41 See K.

Under its Chairman, Fairfax Harrison of the Southern Railroad, the War Board established a Com- mittee on Car Service to coordinate national car supplies. Aiding the coordination effort was the Interstate Commerce Commission, the longtime federal regulatory body for the railroads. Once again, the government-promoted monopoly was an inspiration to many who were looking ahead to the peacetime economy. For several years the railroads had been agitating for \"scientific management\" as a means of achieving higher rates from the ICC and a governmentally imposed cartelization; but they had been thwarted by the pressure of the organized shippers, the industrial users of the railroads. But now even the shippers were impressed. Max Thelen, chairman of the California Railroad Commission, president of the National Association of Railway and Utilities Com- missions, and the leading spokesman for the organized shippers, agreed that the critical railroad problem was \"duplication,\" and the \"irrational\" lack of complete inter- railroad coordination. And Senator Francis G. Newlands (D., Nev.), the most powerful congressman on railroad affairs as the chairman of a joint committee on transporta- tion regulation, opined that the wartime experience was \"somewhat shattering on old views regarding antitrust laws.\" 42 Soon, however, it became clear that the system of voluntary private coordination was not really working well. Traffic departments of individual roads persisted in com- petitive practices; the railroad brotherhood unions were persistently demanding substantial wage increases; and the railroads and organized shippers locked horns over railroad demands for an across-the-board rate increase. All groups 4 2 Kerr, op. cit., p. 48."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"90  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN felt that regional coordination and overall efficiency would best be achieved by outright federal operation of the rail- roads. The shippers first proposed the scheme as a method of achieving coordination and to forestall higher freight rates; the unions seconded the plan in order to obtain wage increases from the government; and the railroads cheer- fully agreed when President Wilson assured them that each road would be guaranteed its 1916/17 profits—two years of unusually high profits for the railroad industry. With the federal government offering to take on the headaches of wartime dislocation and management, while granting the roads a very high guaranteed profit for doing nothing, why shouldn't the railroads leap to agreement? The most enthusiastic Administration proponent of fed- eral operation of the railroads was Secretary of the Trea- sury McAdoo, a former New York railroad executive and close associate of the Morgan interests, who in turn were the leading underwriters and owners of railroad bonds. McAdoo was rewarded by being named head of the United States Railroad Administration after Wilson seized the railroads on December 28, 1917. Federal rule by the Morgan-oriented McAdoo proved to be a bonanza for the nation's railroads. Not only were the railroads now fully monopolized by direct government operation, but also the particular railroad executives now found themselves armed with the coercive power of the federal government. For McAdoo chose as his immediate assistants a group of top railroad executives, and all rate- setting powers of the ICC were shifted to the railroad- dominated Railroad Administration for the duration. 43 The significance of the shift is that the railroads, although 43 McAdoo's \"cabinet,\" which assisted him in running the rail- roads, included Walker D.

This had meant that the railroads had found it very difficult to win freight rate in- creases from the ICC. But now the wartime federal control of the railroads was shunting the shippers aside. 44 McAdoo's brazen appointment of railroad men to virtu- ally all the leading positions in the Railroad Administration, to the virtual exclusion of shippers and academic economists, greatly angered the shippers, who had launched an intense barrage of criticism of the system by midsummer of 1918. This barrage came to a head when McAdoo increasingly turned the direction of the RA, including the appointment of regional directors, over to his principal assistant, rail- road executive Walker D. Hines. Shippers and ICC commis- sioners complained that railroad lawyers from the entire country descended on Washington, told their troubles to other railroad lawyers serving on McAdoo's staff, and were \"told to go into an adjoining room and dictate what orders they want.\" 45 As in the case of the War Industries Board, the railroad executives used their coercive governmental powers to deal a crippling blow to diversity and competition, on behalf of monopoly, in the name of \"efficiency\" and standardization. Again, over the opposition of shippers, the RA ordered the Comptroller of the Currency John Skelton Williams, formerly chairman of the board of the Seaboard R.R.

All of these edicts reduced railroad services to the hap- less shippers. There were still other coerced reductions of service. One ended the shippers' privileges of specifying freight routes—and thereby of specifying the cheapest routes for shipping their goods. Another upset the peace- time practice of making the railroads liable for losses and damages to shipments; instead, the entire burden of proof was placed upon the shippers. Another RA ruling—the \"sailing day plan\"—ordered freight cars to remain in their terminals until filled, thus sharply curtailing service to small-town shippers. The granting of absolute power to the railroad-domi- nated RA was cemented by the Federal Control Act of March, 1918, which ex post facto legalized the illegal federal takeover. Working closely with railroad lobbyists, the RA, backed by the full support of President Wilson, was able to drive through Congress the transfer of rate- making powers to itself from the ICC. Furthermore, all power was taken away from the invariably shipper-domi- nated state railroad commissions. The RA hastened to exercise its rate-setting powers, announcing freight rate increases of twenty-five percent across the board in the spring of 1918—an act that perma- nently cemented shipper hostility to the system of federal operation. To add insult to injury, the new higher rates were set without any public hearings or consultation with other agencies or interests involved.

But,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 93 on the contrary, the war collectivism served as an inspira- tion and as a model for a mighty army of forces destined to forge the history of twentieth-century America. For big business, the wartime economy was a model of what could be achieved in national coordination and cartelization, in stabilizing production, prices, and profits, in replacing old- fashioned competitive laissez-faire by a system that they could broadly control and that would harmonize the claims of various powerful economic groups. It was a system that had already abolished much competitive diversity in the name of standardization. The wartime economy especially galvanized such business leaders as Bernard Baruch and Herbert Hoover, who would promote the cooperative \"association\" of business trade groups as Secretary of Commerce during the 1920s, an associationism that paved the way for the cooperative statism of Franklin Roosevelt's AAA and NRA. The wartime collectivism also held forth a model to the nation's liberal intellectuals; for here was seemingly a sys- tem that replaced laissez-faire not by the rigors and class hatreds of proletarian Marxism, but by a new strong State, planning and organizing the economy in harmony with all leading economic groups. It was, not coincidentally, to be a neomercantilism, a \"mixed economy,\" heavily staffed by these selfsame liberal intellectuals. And finally, both big business and the liberals saw in the wartime model a way to organize and integrate the often unruly labor force as a junior partner in the corporatist system—a force to be disciplined by their own \"responsible\" leadership of the labor unions. For the rest of his life, Bernard Mannes Baruch sought to restore the lineaments of the wartime model. Thus, in summing up the experience of the WIB, Baruch extolled the fact that: many businessmen have experienced during the war, for the first time in their careers, the tremendous ad- vantages, both to themselves and to the general public,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN of combination, of cooperation and common ac- tion . . . Baruch called for the continuance of such corporate asso- ciations, in \"inaugurating rules\" to eliminate \"waste\" (i.e., competition), to exchange trade information, to agree on the channeling of supply and demand among themselves, to avoid \"extravagant\" forms of competition and to allo- cate the location of production. Completing the outlines of a corporate state, Baruch urged that such associations be governed by a federal agency, either the Department of Commerce or the Federal Trade Commission an agency whose duty it should be to encourage, under strict Government supervision, such coopera- tion and coordination . . . 46 Baruch also envisioned a federal board for the retraining and channeling of labor after the war. At the very least, he urged standby legislation for price control and for indus- trial coordination and mobilization in the event of another war. 47 During the 1920s and 1930s, Bernard Baruch served as a major inspiration of the drive toward a corporate state; moreover, many of the leaders of this drive were men who had served under him during the heady days of the WIB and who continued to function frankly as \"Baruch's men\" in national affairs. Thus, aided by Baruch, George N. Peek, of the Moline Plow Company, launched in the early 1920s the drive for farm price supports through federally organized farm cartels that was to culminate in President Hoover's Federal Farm Board in 1929 and then in Roose- velt's AAA. Peek's farm equipment business, of course, stood to benefit greatly from farm subsidies. Hoover ap- pointed as first Chairman of the FFB none other than 46 Bernard M.

When Franklin Roosevelt created the AAA, he first offered the job of director to Baruch, and then gave the post to Baruch's man, George Peek. Neither was Baruch laggard in promoting a corporatist system for industry as a whole. In the spring of 1930, Baruch proposed a peacetime reincarnation of the WIB as a \"Supreme Court of Industry.\" In September of the fol- lowing year, Gerard Swope, head of General Electric and brother of Baruch's closest confidant Herbert Bayard Swope, presented an elaborated plan for a corporate state that essentially revived the system of wartime planning. At the same time, one of Baruch's oldest friends, former Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, was proposing a similar plan for a \"Peace Industries Board.\" After Hoover dis- mayed his old associates by rejecting the plan, Franklin Roosevelt embodied it in the NRA, selecting Gerard Swope to help write the final draft, and picking another Baruch disciple and World War aide General Hugh S. Johnson— also of the Moline Plow Company—to direct this major instrument of state corporatism. When Johnson was fired, Baruch himself was offered the post. 48 Other leading NRA officials were veterans of war mobi- lization.

As soon as the war was over, Hoover set out to \"reconstruct America\" along the lines of peacetime cooperation. He urged national planning through \"volun- tary\" cooperation among businessmen and other economic groups under the \"central direction\" of the government. The Federal Reserve System was to allocate capital to essential industries and thereby to eliminate the competi- tive \"wastes\" of the free market. And in his term as Secretary of Commerce during the 1920s, Hoover assidu- ously encouraged the cartelization of industry through trade associations. In addition to inaugurating the modern program of farm price supports in the Federal Farm Board, Hoover urged the coffee buyers to form a cartel to lower buying prices; established a buying cartel in the rubber industry; led the oil industry in working toward restrictions on oil production in the name of \"conserva- tion\"; tried repeatedly to raise prices, restrict production, and encourage marketing co-ops in the coal industry; and tried to force the cotton textile industry into a nationwide cartel to restrict production. Specifically in furtherance of the wartime abolition of thousands of diverse and competi- tive products, Hoover continued to impose standardization and \"simplification\" of materials and products during the 1920s. In this way, Hoover managed to abolish or \"sim- plify\" about a thousand industrial products. The \"simplifi- cation\" was worked out by the Department of Commerce 49 See William E.

The intellec- tuals served as advisers, technicians, framers of legislation, and administrators of bureaus. Furthermore, apart from the rewards of newly acquired prestige and power, the war economy held out to such intellectuals the promise of transforming the society into a \"third way\" completely different from the laissez-faire past that they scorned or the looming proletarian Marxism that they reviled and feared. Here was a planned corporate economy that seemed to harmonize all groups and classes under a strong and guid- ing nation-state with the liberals themselves at or near the helm.

Thus, the New Republic hailed the \"revolutionizing\" of society by means of the war; John Dewey hailed the replacement of production for profit and \"the absoluteness of private property\" by production for use. Economists were particularly enchanted by the \"no- table demonstration of the power of war to force concert of effort and collective planning,\" and looked for \"the same sort of centralized directing now employed to kill their enemies abroad for the new purpose of reconstructing their own life at home.\" 53 Rexford Guy Tugwell, ever alert to the advance of social engineering, was soon to look back wistfully upon \"America's wartime socialism\"; lamenting the end of the war, he declared that \"only the Armistice prevented a great experiment in control of production, control of price, and control of consumption.\" For, during the war, the old system of industrial competition had \"melted away in the fierce new heat of nationalistic vision.\" 54 Not merely the NRA and AAA, but virtually the entire New Deal apparatus—including the bringing to Washing- ton of a host of liberal intellectuals and planners—owed its inspiration to the war collectivism of World War I.

The Tennessee Valley Authority grew out of a wartime government nitrate and electric-power project at Muscle Shoals, and in fact included the old nitrate plant as one of its first assets. Moreover, many of the public power advocates in the New Deal had been .trained in such wartime agencies as the Power Section of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. And even the innovative government corporate form of the TVA was based on wartime prece- dent. 55 Wartime experience also provided the inspiration for the public housing movement of the New Deal. During the war, the Emergency Fleet Corp. and the United States Housing Corp. were established to provide housing for war workers. The war established the precedent of federal housing, and also trained architects like Robert Kohn, who functioned as chief of production for the housing division of the United States Shipping Board. After the war, Kohn exulted that \"the war has put housing 'on the map' in this country\"; and in 1933, Kohn was duly named by President Roosevelt to be the director of the New Deal's first venture into public housing.

The idea was to take the \"wandering boys\" off the road and \"mobilize\" them into a new form of American Expeditionary Force. The Army, in fact, ran the CCC camps; CCC recruits were gathered at Army recruit- ing stations, equipped with World War I clothing, and assembled in army tents.

Business leaders pressed for two postwar goals: continuance of government price-fixing to protect them against an expected postwar deflation; and a longer-range attempt to promote industrial cartelization in peacetime. In particular, businessmen wanted the price maxima (which had often served as minima instead) to be converted simply into outright 57 Ibid., p. 117.

Wartime quotas to restrict production, furthermore, needed only to remain in being to function as a frank cartelizing for raising prices in time of peace. Accordingly, many of the industrial War Service Com- mittees, and their WIB Section counterparts, urged the continuance of the WIB and its price-fixing system. In particular, section chiefs invariably urged continued price control in those industries that feared postwar deflation, while advocating a return to a free market wherever the specific industry expected a continuing boom. Thus, Pro- fessor Himmelberg concluded: Section chiefs in their recommendations to the Board consistently followed the wishes of their industries in urging protection if the industry expected price de- clines and release of all controls when the industry expected a favorable postwar market. 58 Robert S. Brookings, Chairman of the Price-Fixing Com- mittee of the WIB, declared that the WIB would be \"as helpful . . . during the reconstruction period as we have during the war period in stabilizing values.\" 59 From the big-business world, meanwhile, Harry A. Wheeler, president of the United States Chamber of Com- merce, presented to Woodrow Wilson in early October, 1918, an ambitious scheme for a \"Reconstruction Commis- sion,\" to be composed of all the economic interests of the nation. The WIB itself concurred, and urged the President to allow it to continue after the war. Baruch himself urged upon Wilson the continuation of at least the minimum price-fixing policies of the WIB. However, Baruch was 58 Robert F.

The great problem with these ambitious plans of both industry and government was President Wilson himself. Perhaps a lingering attachment to the ideals, or at least to the rhetoric, of free competition prevented the President from giving any favorable attention to these postwar schemes. 60 The attachment was particularly nourished by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, of all Wilson's ad- visers the closest to a believer in laissez-faire. Throughout October, 1918, Wilson rejected all of these proposals. The response of Baruch and the WIB was to put further pres- sure on Wilson during early November, by publicly pre- dicting and urging that the WIB would definitely be needed during demobilization. Thus The New York Times re- ported, the day after the Armistice, that War Industries Board officials declared there would be much work for that organization to do. They foresee no serious industrial dislocation with the Government's grip on all war industries and material held tight. 61 The President remained adamant, however, and on November 23 he ordered the complete disbanding of the WIB by the end of the year. The disappointed WIB offi- cials accepted the decision without protest; partly because of expected congressional opposition to any attempt to continue, partly from the hostility to continued controls by those industries anticipating a boom. Thus, the shoe indus- try particularly chafed at any continuing controls. 62 The industries favoring controls, however, urged the WIB at 60 Ibid., pp. 63-64; Urofsky, op. cit., pp. 298-299. 61 Quoted in Himmelberg, p. 64. 62 Favoring continuing price controls were such industries as the chemical, iron and steel, lumber, and finished products generally.

The Board was sorely tempted to engage in this final exploit, and indeed was informed by its legal staff that it could successfully continue such controls beyond the life of the agency even against the will of the President. The WIB, however, reluc- tantly turned down requests to this effect by the acid, zinc, and steel manufacturers on December n. 63 It only re- jected the price-fixing plans, however, because it feared being overturned by the courts should the Attorney Gen- eral challenge such a decision. One of the most ardent advocates of continued WIB price control was the great steel industry. Two days after the Armistice, Judge Gary of U.S. Steel urged the WIB to continue its regulations, and declared that \"The members of the steel industry desire to cooperate with each other in every proper way. . . .\" Gary urged a three-month exten- sion of price-fixing, with further gradual reductions that would prevent a return to \"destructive\" competition. Baruch replied that he was personally \"willing to go to the very limit,\" but he was blocked by Wilson's attitude. 64 If the WIB itself could not continue, perhaps the war- time cartelization could persist in other forms. During November, Arch W. Shaw, Chicago industrialist and head of the Conservation Division of the WIB (whose wartime work in fostering standardization was being transferred to the Department of Commerce) and Secretary of Com- merce William Redfield agreed on a bill to allow manufac- turers to collaborate in \"the adoption of plans for the elimination of needless waste in the public interest,\" under the supervision of the Federal Trade Commission.

The Parker plan won the approval of Baruch, Peek, and nu- merous other government officials and businessmen, but WIB's legal counsel warned that Congress would never give its consent. 65 Another proposal that interested Baruch was advanced by Mark Requa, Assistant Food Administrator, who proposed a United States Board of Trade to encourage and regulate industrial agreements that \"promoted the national welfare.\" 66 Whatever the reason, Bernard Baruch failed to press hard for these proposals, and so they died on the vine. If Baruch failed to press matters, however, his associate George Peek, head of the Finished Products Division of the WIB, was not so reticent. By mid-December, 1918, Peek wrote Baruch that the postwar era must retain the \"benefits of proper cooperation.\" In particular, proper legislation should be enacted to permit co- operation in industry, in order that the lessons we have learned during the war may be capitalized ... in peacetime. . . .

In early December, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States called a meeting of the various industrial War Ser- vice Committees to convene as a \"Reconstruction Congress of American Industry.\" The Reconstruction Congress called for revision of the Sherman Act to permit \"reason- able\" trade agreements under a supervisory body. Further- more, a nationwide Chamber referendum, in early 1919, approved such a proposal by an overwhelming majority; and president Harry Wheeler urged the \"cordial acceptance by organized business\" of regulation that would ratify business agreements. The National Association of Manu- facturers, before the war devoted to competition, warmly endorsed the same goals. The last gasp of wartime cartelization came in February, 1919, with the establishment by the Department of Com- merce of the Industrial Board. 69 Secretary of Commerce William C. Redfield, formerly president of the American Manufacturers Export Association, had long championed the view that government should promote and coordinate industrial cooperation. Redfield saw an entering wedge with the transfer of the WIB's Conservation Division to his department shortly after the Armistice. Redfield continued the wartime stimulation of trade associations, and to that end established an advisory board of former WIB officials. One of these advisers was George Peek; another was Peek's assistant on the WIB, Ohio lumber executive William M. Ritter. It was Ritter, in fact, who originated the idea of the Industrial Board. The Industrial Board, conceived by Ritter in January, 1919, and enthusiastically adopted and pushed by Secre- tary Redfield, was a cunning scheme. On its face, and as 69 On the Industrial Board, see Robert F.

It was therefore seemingly unrelated to the previ- ous cartelizing drive and hence won the approval of the President, who established the new Board in mid-February. At Ritter's urging, George Peek was named chairman of the IB; other members included Ritter himself; George R. James, head of a major Memphis dry-goods concern and former chief of the Cotton and Cotton Linters section of the WIB; Lewis B. Reed, vice-president of the U.S. Silica Co. and another former assistant to Peek; steel castings manufacturer Samuel P. Bush, former head of the WIB's Facilities Division; Atlanta steel-fabricating manufacturer Thomas Glenn, also a veteran of the WIB; and two \"out- siders,\" one representing the Labor Department and the other the Railroad Administration. No sooner did the IB get under way than it pursued its real, but previously camouflaged, purpose: not to reduce, but rather to stabilize prices at existing high levels. More- over, the method of stabilization would be the longed-for but previously rejected path of ratifying industrial price agreements arrived at in collaboration with the Board. Deciding on this cartelizing policy in early March, the IB moved toward the first application in a conference with, unsurprisingly, the steel industry on March 19-20, 1919. Opening the conference, Chairman George Peek grandly declared that the event might prove \"epoch-making,\" espe- cially in establishing \"real genuine cooperation between Government, industry, and labor, so that we may eliminate ... the possibility of the destructive forces . . .\" 70 The steel men were of course delighted, hailing the \"great chance ... to come into close contact with the Govern- Himmelberg, \"Industrial Board,\" p. 13."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 107 ment itself . . .\" 71 The IB told the steel industry that any agreement to sustain prices agreed upon by the conference would be immune from the antitrust laws. Not only was the price list offered by the IB to the steel men still very high even if moderately lower than existing prices; but Peek agreed to announce to the public that steel prices would not be lowered further for the remainder of the year. Peek advised the steel men that his statement would be their biggest asset; for \"I don't know what I wouldn't have given in times past if in my own business I could say that the government of the United States says this is as low a price as you could get.\" 72 The IB-steel agreement lowered steel prices by a modest ten to fourteen percent. The small, high-cost steel pro- ducers were disgruntled, but the big steel firms welcomed the agreement as a coordinated, orderly reduction of in- flated prices, and especially welcomed the Board's guaran- tee of the fixed price for the remainder of the year. The elated IB proceeded with similar conferences for the coal and building materials industries, but two dark clouds promptly appeared: the refusal of the government's own Railroad Administration to pay the fixed, agreed-upon, price for steel rails and for coal; and the concern of the Justice Department for the evident violation of the anti- trust laws. The railroad men running the RA particularly balked at the reduced but still high price that they were going to be forced to pay for steel rails—at a rate that they declared was at least two dollars per ton above the free- market price. Walker D. Hines, head of the RA, de- nounced the IB as a price-fixing agency, dominated by steel 71 Professor Urofsky surmised from the orderly and very moderate price reductions in steel during the first months of 1919 that Robert S.

This call was seconded by the powerful Secretary of the Treasury Carter Glass. The Attorney General concurred that the IB's policy was illegal price- fixing, and in violation of the antitrust laws. Finally, Presi- dent Wilson dissolved the Industrial Board in early May, 1919; wartime industrial planning had at last been dis- solved, its formal cartelization to reappear a decade and a half later. Yet remnants of wartime collectivism still remained. The high wartime minimum wheat price of two dollars and twenty-six cents a bushel was carried over to the 1919 crop, continuing until June, 1920. But the most important carry-over of war collectivism was the Railroad Adminis- tration: the government's operation of the nation's rail- roads. When William Gibbs McAdoo resigned as head of the RA at the end of the war, he was succeeded by the previous de facto operating head, railroad executive Walker D. Hines. There was no call for immediate return to private operation, because the railroad industry gen- erally agreed upon drastic regulation to curb or eliminate \"wasteful\" railroad competition and coordinate the indus- try, to fix prices to insure a \"fair profit,\" and to outlaw strikes through compulsory arbitration. This was the over- all thrust of railroad sentiment. Furthermore, being in effective control of the RA, the roads were in no hurry to return to private operation and jurisdiction by the less reliable ICC. Although McAdoo's plan to postpone by five years the given 1920 date for return to private operation gained little support, Congress proceeded to use its time during 1919 to tighten the monopolization of the railroads. In the name of \"scientific management,\" Senator Albert Cummins (R., Iowa) proceeded to grant the railroads' fondest dreams. Cummins' bill, warmly approved by Hines and railroad executive Daniel Willard, ordered the consoli- dation of numerous railroads, and would set the railroad"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"War Collectivism in World War I 109 rates according to a \"fair,\" fixed return on capital invest- ment. Strikes would be outlawed, and all labor disputes settled by compulsory arbitration. For their part, the Asso- ciation of Railroad Executives submitted a legislative plan similar to the Cummins Bill. Also similar to the Cummins Bill was the proposal of the National Association of Owners of Railroad Securities, a group composed largely of savings banks and insurance companies. In contrast to these plans, the Citizens National Railroad League, consist- ing of individual railroad investors, proposed coerced con- solidation into one national railroad corporation, and the guaranteeing of minimum earnings to this new road. All of these plans were designed to tip the prewar bal- ance sharply in favor of the railroads and against the shippers, and, as a result, the Cummins Bill, in passing the Senate, ran into trouble in the House. The trouble was fomented by the shippers, who demanded a return to the status quo ante when the shipper-dominated ICC was in charge. Furthermore, for their part the wartime experience had embittered the shippers, who, along with the ICC it- self, demanded a return to the higher quality service provided by railroad competition rather than the increased monopolization provided by the various railroad bills. Unsurprisingly, however, one of the leading nonrailroad business groups favoring the Cummins Bill was the Rail- way Business Association, a group of manufacturers and distributors of railroad supplies and equipment. The House of Representatives, in its turn, passed the Esch Bill, which essentially reestablished the prewar rule of the ICC. President Wilson had put pressure on Congress to make a decision by threatening the return of the railroads to private operation by the given date of January 1, 1920, but, under pressure of the railroads who were anxious to push the Cummins Bill, Wilson extended the deadline to March 1. Finally, the joint conference committee of Con- gress reported out the Transportation Act of 1920, a compromise that was essentially the Esch Bill returning the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"IIO  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN railroads to the prewar ICC, but adding the Cummins provisions for a two-year guarantee to the railroads to set rates providing a \"fair return\" of five and a half percent on investment. Furthermore, on the agreement of both ship- pers and the roads, the power to set minimum railroad rates was now granted to the ICC. This agreement was the product of railroads eager to set a floor under freight rates, and shippers anxious to protect budding canal transporta- tion against railroad competition. Furthermore, although railway union objections blocked the provision for the outlawing of strikes, a Railroad Labor Board was estab- lished to try to settle labor disputes. 73 With the return of the railroads to private operation in March, 1920, war collectivism finally and at long last seemed to pass from the American scene. But pass it never really did; for the inspiration and the model that it fur- nished for a corporate state in America continued to guide Herbert Hoover and other leaders in the 1920s, and was to return full-blown in the New Deal, and in the World War II economy. In fact, it supplied the broad outlines for the Corporate Monopoly State that the New Deal was to establish, seemingly permanently, in the United States of America. 73 On the maneuvering leading to the Transportation Act of 1920, see Kerr, op. cit., pp. 128-227."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Herbert Hoover and the Myth of Laissez-Faire MURRAY N. ROTHBARD The conventional wisdom, of historian and layman alike, pictures Herbert Hoover as the last stubborn guardian of laissez-faire in America. The laissez-faire economy, so this wisdom runs, produced the Great Depression in 1929, and Hoover's traditional, do-nothing policies could not stem the tide. Hence, Hoover and his hidebound policies were swept away, and Franklin Roosevelt entered to bring to America a New Deal, a new progressive economy of state regulation and intervention fit for the modern age. The major theme of this paper is that this conventional historical view is pure mythology and that the facts are virtually the reverse: that Herbert Hoover, far from being an advocate of laissez-faire, was in every way the precursor of Roosevelt and the New Deal, that, in short, he was one of the major leaders of the twentieth-century shift from relatively laissez-faire capitalism to the modern corporate state. In the terminology of William A. Williams and the New Left, Hoover was a preeminent \"corporate liberal.\" When Herbert Hoover returned to the United States in late 1919, fresh from his post as Relief Administrator in Europe, he came armed with a suggested \"Reconstruction Program\" for America.

Hoover's plan also included the creation of public dams, the improvement of waterways, a federal home-loan bank- ing system, the promotion of unions and collective bargain- ing, and governmental regulation of the stock market to eliminate \"vicious speculation.\" 2 It is no wonder that Progressive Republicans as well as such Progressive Demo- crats as Louis Brandeis, Herbert Croly, and others on the New Republic, Edward A. Filene, Colonel Edward M. House, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, boomed Hoover for the presidency during the 1920 campaign. Hoover was appointed Secretary of Commerce by Presi- dent Harding under pressure by the Progressive wing of the party, and accepted under the condition that he would be consulted on all the economic activities of the federal government. He thereupon set out deliberately to \"recon- struct America.\" 3 Hoover was only thwarted from breaking the firm American tradition of laissez-faire during a depression by the fact that the severe but short-lived depression of 1920-21 was over soon after he took office. He also faced some reluctance on the part of Harding and the Cabinet. 1 Hoover's earlier career confirms this appraisal of his views; there is no space here, however, to analyze his earlier ideas and activities. 2 See Joseph Dorfman, The Economic Mind in American Civilization (New York: Viking Press, 1959), Vol. IV, pp. 26- 28; Herbert Hoover, Memoirs (New York: Macmillan, 1952), Vol. II, pp. 27 ff; and Murray N.

Furthermore, Hoover organized the various federal, state, and municipal governments to increase public works, and persuaded the biggest business firms, such as Standard Oil of New Jersey and United States Steel, to increase their expenditure on repairs and construction. He also persuaded employers to spread unemployment by cutting hours for all workers instead of discharging the marginal workers—an action he was to repeat in the 1929 Depression. 4 Hoover called for these interventionist measures with an analogy from the institutions of wartime planning and collaboration, urging that Americans develop \"the same spirit of spontaneous cooperation in every community for reconstruction that we had in war.\" 5 An important harbinger for Hoover's later Depression policies was the President's Conference on Unemployment, a gathering of eminent leaders of industry, banking, and labor called by President Harding in the fall of 1921 at the instigation of Hoover.

Following the path of all would-be cartel- ists who are hostile to no one more than the individualistic competitor, Franklin D.

It was clear that the engineering profession would also benefit greatly from government subsidization of the construction industry.

Hoover's pro-union views first achieved prominence when, as chairman of President Wilson's Second Industrial Conference (1919/20), he guided this conference of cor- porate-liberal industrialists and labor leaders to criticize \"company unionism\" and to urge the expansion of collec- tive bargaining, government arbitration boards for labor disputes, and a program of national health and old-age insurance. Soon afterward Hoover arranged a meeting of leading industrialists with \"advanced views,\" in an unsuc- cessful attempt to persuade them to \"establish liaison\" with the AFofL. In January, 1921, the AF of L journal pub- lished a significant address by Hoover, which called for the \"definite organization of great national associations\" of economic groups and their mutual cooperation. This co- operation would serve to promote efficiency, and mitigate labor-management conflict. Above all, workers would be protected from \"the unfair competition of the sweatshop.\" Still more did this mean \"protection\" of the lower-cost large employers from the competition of their smaller \"sweatshop\" rivals—a typical instance of monopolizers using humanitarian rhetoric to gain public support for the restriction and suppression of competition. Hoover went so far in this address as to support the closed shop, provided that the closure was to be for the sake of unity of purpose in aiding the employer to increase production and to mold a cooperative labor force.

This influence was particularly strong in persuading the labor leaders to endorse the idea of organizing all the large occupation groups and then effecting their mutual harmony and cooperation under the aegis and control of the federal government. Capital and labor in each industry, organized in collaboration, were to have the role of government of that particular industry. 12 It was indeed appropriate for the French politician Edouard Herriot to praise Hoover in 1920 for his idea of fusing the \"economic trinity\" of labor, capital, and govern- ment into one system, thus putting an end to the class struggle. 13 Another reason for Hoover's pro-union attitude was that he had adopted the increasingly popular thesis that high wage rates were a major cause of prosperity. It then fol- lowed that wage rates must not be lowered during depres- sions. In contrast to all prior depressions, including 1920-21, when wage rates were cut sharply, wage-cutting was considered by Hoover to be impermissible and as leading to a failure in purchasing power and the perpetua- tion of depression. These views were to prove a fateful harbinger of the policies used during the Great Depression. One of Hoover's most important labor interventions during the 1920s came in the steel industry.

In doing so, Hoover was siding with the liberal wing of the steel industry, led by Charles R. Hook and Alexander Legge, whose plants had already instituted the shorter workday, and who of course were anxious to impose higher costs on their lagging competitors. When Judge Gary of United States Steel and other leading steelmen refused to go along, Hoover acted to mobilize public opinion against them. Thus, he induced the national engineering societies to endorse the eight-hour day, and himself wrote the introduction to the endorse- ment. Finally, Hoover wrote a stern letter of rebuke for President Harding, which Harding sent to Gary on June 18, 1923, forcing Gary to capitulate. Herbert Hoover also played a leading role in collectiviz- ing labor relations in the railroad industry, thereby carteliz- ing that industry still further than before and incorporating railway unions within the cartel framework. After repeated and largely unsuccessful interventions to try to gain pro- union concessions during the railroad strike of 1922, Hoover became a major author—along with union lawyers Donald Richberg and David E. Lilienthal—of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, by which the railway unions got them- selves established in the industry. The ancestor of the New Deal's Wagner Act, the Railway Labor Act, imposed collective bargaining upon the industry; in return, the unions agreed to give up the strike weapon.

His trade commissioners and attaches aided American exports in numerous ways. He also reorganized the Bureau along commodity lines, with each commodity division headed by someone chosen by the particular trade or in- dustry, from the trade \"he knows and represents.\" 18 Furthermore, Hoover promoted the cartelization of each industry by inducing each trade to create a committee to cooperate with the Department of Commerce, and to select the industry's choice for head of the commodity division. Officials in the Department were systematically recruited from business, to stay in the Department for a few years, and then to return to private business at higher-paying jobs. One favorite method of Hoover's for subsidizing as well as cartelizing exports was to foster the creation of export- trade associations. Thus, in 1926, Hoover repeatedly urged the coffee trade to band together and create a National Coffee Council, so that all American coffee buyers could join together to lower buying prices. Hoover and his aides craftily suggested to the coffee trade that one union leader and one woman consumer be named to the proposed Coffee Council as a public-relations device to relieve public fears of a cartel. 19 The difficulties of forming a coffee cartel proved insur- mountable; but Hoover had more luck with the rubber industry, organizing it to fight British cartel restrictions on Asian rubber production that had been imposed in 1922.

When little came of this pressure, Hoover began to threaten congressional action if the banks did not agree. For Hoover, the aim of subsidizing exports was so important that even unsound foreign loans that could serve this purpose were considered worthwhile. 22 Hoover's opposition to foreign \"monopoly\" did not of course prevent him from supporting a protective tariff in the United States, thus providing privilege to American domestic as well as export firms.

Hoover was particularly interested in removing antitrust limitations on industrial cooperation in such restrictive measures. 23 In the field of coal, Hoover sponsored repeated attempts at cartelization. The first attempt was a bill in 1921 to establish a federal coal commission to gather and publish statistics of the coal industry, so as to publicize price data and thereby facilitate industry-wide price-fixing. Failing a commission, the Department of Commerce was eager to take on the task. However, this and a later scheme by Hoover to encourage marketing cooperatives in coal by exemption from antitrust laws, were defeated by the oppo- sition of competitive low-cost Southern coal operators. Undaunted, Hoover, in 1922, prepared a full-fledged cartel- izing plan. The idea was to establish unemployment insur- ance in the coal industry, so designed as to penalize in the cost of the plan the part-time and seasonal coal mines, and thereby to drive these higher-cost mines out of business. The coal industry would then form cooperatives, which would fix and allocate quotas on production, putting more mines out of operation, the owners to be compensated out of the increased cartel profits made by the rest of the industry. The district coal cooperatives were to market all the coal and then divide the revenues proportionately.

Hoover also played a role in forcing the cotton textile industry to establish a nationwide rather than a regional trade association, to the delight of the bulk of the industry. Hoover repeatedly urged the many reluctant firms to join this Cotton Textile Institute, which gave promise of stabilizing the industry and elimi- nating \"waste\" in production. Hoover went so far as to endorse, in 1927, the CTFs plan to urge each of the mem- ber firms to cut production by a certain definite amount. 25 One of the clearest indications of how far removed Hoover was from laissez-faire was his leading role in nationalizing the airwaves of the fledgling radio industry. Hoover put through the nationalizing Radio Act in 1927 as a substitute for the courts' increasing application of the common law, granting private ownership of the airwaves to the first radio stations that put them into use. 26 One of the most pervasive and least studied methods by which Hoover helped to monopolize industry during the Harking back to his wartime experience, he established a net- work of district committees to hold down coal prices.

All in all, about three thousand articles were thus \"simplified.\" The recommendations for simplifi- cation were worked out by the Department of Commerce with the aid of the eager committees representing each trade. 27 Hoover's approach to the farm question was consistent: a repeated emphasis on the cartelization of agriculture. 28 At first, the favored means was the subsidizing by govern- ment of farm cooperatives. Hoover helped write the act of August, 1921, which expanded the funds allotted to the War Finance Corporation and permitted it to lend directly to the farm co-ops. He also supported the farm-bloc bill for an extensive system of Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and a Federal Farm Loan Board, which were to lend federal funds to farm co-ops. In the Department of Commerce, he was able to help farm co-ops with market- ing programs, and with aid in finding export markets.

His most fate- ful act was to call a series of White House Conferences with the nation's leading financiers and industrialists, and induce them to pledge that wage rates would not be lowered and that they would expand their investments. Hoover explained the general aim of these conferences to be the coordination of business and government agencies in concerted action. Industrial group after group pledged that wage rates would be maintained. Hoover insisted that, contrary to previous depressions when wage rates fell promptly and rapidly (and, we might add, the depression was then soon over), wage rates must now be the last to fall, in order to prop up mass purchasing power.

Even with the cuts in wages, wage rates fell by only twenty- three percent from 1929 to 1933—less than the decline of prices. Thus, real wage rates actually rose over the period, by over eight percent in the leading manufacturing indus- tries. The drop in wage rates had been far more prompt and extensive in the far milder 1921 depression. In the face of this record of wage maintenance, the unemployment rate rose to twenty-five percent of the labor force by 1933, and to a phenomenal forty-six percent in the leading manufacturing industries.

In the crucial figure of government securities owned by the Federal Reserve Banks, Federal Reserve holdings rose from $300 million in September, 1929, to $1,840 million in March, 1933—a sixfold increase. Ordinarily this would have led to a sixfold expansion of bank reserves and an enormous inflation of the money supply. But the Hoover drive for inflation was thwarted by the forces of the economy. Federal Reserve rediscounts fell by half a billion due to sluggish business demand, despite a sharp drop in the Federal Reserve's dis- count rate; cash in circulation increased by one and a half billion due to the public's growing distrust of the shaky and inflated banking system; and the banks began to pile up excess reserves because of their fear of making investments amidst the sea of business failures.

This was, to that moment, the largest peacetime federal deficit in American history. Part of this massive rise of federal expenditures went, as one might expect, into public works. So promptly did Hoover act to expand public works (proposing a $600 million increase by December, 1929) that by the end of 1929 the economist J. M. Clark was already hailing Hoover's \"great experiment in constructive industrial statesmanship.\" 42 In February, 1931, Hoover's Emergency Committee for Employment was instrumental in pushing through Congress Senator Wagner's (D., N.Y.)

In happily signing the measure, Hoover gave a large amount of credit to the veteran public-works agitator, Otto Tod Mallery. 43 In his memoirs, Hoover recalled with pride that his Administration had constructed more public works than had the federal government over the previous thirty years, and that he personally had induced state and local governments to expand their public-works programs by $1.5 billion. He also launched the Boulder, Grand Coulee, and California Central Valley dams, and, after agitating for the project since 1921, Hoover signed a treaty with Canada to build a St. Lawrence Seaway, a treaty rejected by the Senate. 44 Furthermore, the Boulder project was the 42 John Maurice Clark, \"Public Works and Unemployment,\" American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings (May, 1930), pp. 15 ff. 43 See Irving Bernstein, The Lean Years (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, i960), p. 272; Dorfman, op. cit., Vol. V, p. jn. 44 It is instructive to note the attitude of private electrical com- panies toward the government-built Boulder Dam.

As writers, economists, politicians, businessmen, and the construction industry called loudly for many billions in public works, Hoover began to draw back. He began to see public works as costly, and as bringing relief to a selected group only. He came to favor a relatively greater emphasis on federal grants-in-aid and on public works that would be self- liquidating. As a result, federal public-works spending increased only slightly during 1932. As we shall see, Hoover's growing doubts on public works were symptom- atic of a more general process of being left behind by the accelerating onrush toward collectivist thinking that de- veloped during his final year as President. 46 Another massive dose of government intervention was President Hoover's Home Loan Bank System, established in the Federal Home Loan Act of July, 1932. Supported enthusiastically by the building and loan associations, the act paralleled the Federal Reserve Act in relation to these associations. Twelve district banks were established under a Federal Home Loan Bank Board, with a $25 million capi- tal supplied by the Treasury, as a compulsory, central mortgage-discount bank for the building and loan industry.

As it was, Hoover complained that Congress had placed excessively rigorous limits on the amount of discounting that could be made by the Board; but he did his best to spur use of the new system. One of Mr. Hoover's clearest harbingers of the New Deal was his creation in January, 1932, of the Reconstruc- tion Finance Corporation. The RFC was clearly inspired by and modeled after the old wartime War Finance Corpo- ration, which had extended emergency loans to business. One of the leading originators of the RFC was Eugene Meyer, Jr., Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and former Managing Director of the WFC; most of the old WFC staff were employed by the new organization. 47 The RFC began in the fall of 1931 as the National Credit Corporation, through which leading banks were per- suaded, at a secret conference with Hoover and his aides, to extend credit to shaky banks, with Federal Reserve assistance. When the banks balked at this scheme, Hoover threatened legislation to compel their cooperation; in re- turn for their agreement to the NCC, the Administration agreed that it would be strictly temporary, to be replaced soon by an RFC. The RFC bill was passed hurriedly by Congress in January, 1932. The Treasury furnished it with half a billion dollars, and it was empowered to issue debentures up to $1.5 billion. Meyer was chosen to be chairman of the new organization. In the first half of 1932, the RFC ex- tended, in the deepest secrecy, $1 billion of loans, largely 47 Leuchtenburg, \"The New Deal and the Analogue of War,\" pp. 98-100. Also see Gerald D.

P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb and Co. One of the important enthusiasts for this policy was Eugene Meyer, Jr., on the grounds of \"promoting recovery\" and frankly, of \"putting more money into the banks.\" Meyer's enthusi- asm might well have been bolstered by the fact that his brother-in-law, George Blumenthal, was an officer of J. P. Morgan & Co., and that he himself had served as an officer of the Morgan bank. But Hoover wasn't satisfied with the massiveness of the RFC program. He insisted that RFC be able to lend more widely to industry and to agriculture, and that it be able to make capital loans. This amendment—the Emergency Re- lief and Construction Act—passed Congress in July, 1932; the Act nearly doubled total RFC capital from $2 billion to $3.8 billion, and greatly widened the scope of RFC lend- ing. 49 During 1932, the RFC extended loans totaling $2.3 billion. Herbert Hoover's enthusiasm for government aid to industry and banking was not matched in the area of Depression relief to the poor; here his instincts were much more voluntarist. Hoover steadfastly maintained his volun- tary relief position until mid-1932. As early as 1930/31, he had been pressured on behalf of federal relief by Colonel Arthur Woods, the Chairman of Hoover's Emergency Committee for Employment, who had previously been a member of Rockefeller's General Education Board. But in 48 Many large loans were made by the RFC to banks that were in the ambit of RFC directors themselves, or of others high up in the Hoover Administration. Thus, shortly after General Charles Dawes resigned as President of the RFC, the bank that he headed, the Central Republic Bank and Trust Co., received a large RFC loan. See John T.

In addition to widening the powers of the RFC loans to industry, Hoover's Emer- gency Relief and Construction Act was the nation's first federal relief legislation. The RFC was authorized to lend $300 million to the states for poor relief. 50 Throughout the Depression, Herbert Hoover gave vent to his long-standing dislike of speculation and the stock market. In the fall of 1930, Hoover threatened federal regulation of the New York Stock Exchange, hitherto thought to be constitutionally subject only to state regula- tion. Hoover forced the Exchange to agree \"voluntarily\" to withhold loans for purposes of short selling. Hoover re- turned to the attack during 1932, threatening federal action against short selling. He also induced the Senate to investigate \"sinister . . . bear raids\" on the Exchange. Hoover seemed to find it sinful and vaguely traitorous for the stock market to judge stock values on the basis of current (low) earnings. Hoover went on to propose what later came to pass as the New Deal's SEC, a regulation that Hoover openly applauded. Hoover's Federal Farm Board was ready to move when the Depression arrived and the FFB proceeded on its proto-New Deal farm policy of attempting to raise and support farm prices. The FFB's first big operation was in wheat. The Board advised the receptive wheat farmers to act like cartelists, in short to hold wheat off the market and wait for higher prices. Soon it began to lend $100 million to wheat co-ops to withhold wheat stocks, and thereby raise prices; and it established a central grain corporation to centralize and coordinate the wheat cooperatives.

The FFB loans and purchases managed to sustain wheat prices for a time; but by the spring of 1930 this had only aggravated the wheat surplus by inducing farmers to expand their produc- tion, and the only result was further declines in price. It became clear to the Hoover Administration that the cartelizing and price-raising policy could not work unless wheat production was reduced. A typical Hooverian round of attempted voluntary persuasion ensued, led by the Secretary of Agriculture and the FFB; a group of econo- mists was sent from Washington to urge the marginal Northwestern wheat farmers—the original agitators for wheat price supports—to shift from wheat into some other crop. Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde and the FFB's Alexander Legge toured the Middle West, urging farmers to lower their wheat acreage. But, as could have been foreseen, none of this moral exhortation was effective, and wheat surpluses continued to pile up and prices to fall. By November, the government's Grain Stabilization Cor- poration had purchased over 65 million bushels of wheat to hold off the market, but to no avail. Then, in November, 1930, Hoover authorized the GSC to purchase as much wheat as might be necessary to stop any further fall in wheat prices. But economic forces could not be defeated so easily, and wheat prices continued to fall. Finally, the FFB conceded defeat and dumped its accumulated wheat stocks, further intensifying the fall in wheat prices. Similar price-support programs were tried in cotton, but with similar disastrous results. Chairman James C. Stone of the Federal Farm Board even tried to mobilize the state governors to plow under every third row of cotton, but still to no avail. Similar calamitous attempts at cartelization occurred in wool, butter, grapes, and tobacco. It was becoming clear that the cartelizing program could not work unless there were compulsory restrictions on production; there were simply too many farmers for volun- tary exhortations to have any effect. President Hoover"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Hoover: The Myth of Laissez-Faire 139 began to move down that road, recommending at least that productive land be withdrawn from cultivation, that crops be plowed under, and that immature farm animals be slaughtered—all to reduce the very surpluses that Hoover's price supports had accumulated. 51 Meanwhile, President Hoover pursued cartelization in other fields with more success. In May, 1931, he ordered the cessation of new leases in the federal forests for pur- poses of lumbering. He also withdrew over two million acres of forest land from production and into \"national forests,\" and increased the area of national parks by forty percent. 52 Hoover put through the McNary-Watres Act of April, 1930, which deliberately used postal air-mail subsidies and regulation to bring commercial airlines under federal orga- nization and control. Hoover's admiring biographers wrote that, as a result of this law: \"The routes were consolidated into a carefully planned national system of commercial airways . . . The Nation was saved from a hodgepodge of airways similar to the tangle that had grown up in rail transportation. \" 53 51 It was left for the conservative Senator Arthur H.

Hoover's original proposal was to give the Federal Power Commission the power to set interstate power rates in collaboration with state power commissions. But Congress refused to go that far, and the FPC, although expanded, continued to exercise power only over water power in rivers. In the coal industry, Hoover sympathized with the Appalachian Coal combine, which marketed three-quarters of Appalachian bituminous coal, in an attempt to raise coal prices and allocate production quotas to the various coal mines. Hoover also called for the reduction of \"de- structive competition\" reigning in the coal industry. 54 Hoover was more specific in helping to cartelize the oil industry. Hoover and his Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur stimulated such states as Texas and Okla- homa to pass oil proration laws in the name of \"conserva- tion,\" to curtail crude oil production and thereby raise prices, and to establish an interstate compact to collaborate in the proration program. Hoover also aided these laws by suspending all further oil leases on public lands and by pressuring oil operators near the public domain to agree to restrict oil production. In sponsoring and encouraging proration laws particu- larly, Hoover was taking his stand with the large oil companies. Hoover's and Wilbur's suggestion of general Sunday shutdowns of oil production was approved by the large companies, but defeated by the opposition of the smaller producers. The smaller firms particularly urged a protective tariff on imported crude and petroleum prod- ucts, which Hoover finally agreed to in 1932.

Despite these services by Hoover, the oil industry was still restive; the industry wanted more, it wanted federal legislation in outright support of restricting production and raising prices. Here, too, President Hoover was beginning to lose the leadership of the accelerating cartelization movement in American industry. 55 In the cotton textile industry, the trade association, the Cotton Textile Institute, which had long been close to Hoover, cunningly decided to press for monopolistic cur- tailment of production under the guise of \"humanitarian- ism.\" The device was to call for the abolition of night work for women and children; such a drive was neatly calculated to appeal both to Hoover's (and to the industry's) monopoloid convictions, as well as to his humanitarian rhetoric. CTI's campaign of 1930/31 to pressure the vari- ous mills to abolish night work for women and children was substantially aided by Hoover and his Department of Commerce, who actively \"helped to whip the noncoop- erators into line.\" Hoover publicized his firm support, and Secretary of Commerce Lamont sent personal letters to cotton textile operators, urging their adherence to the plan. 56 Intense Administration pressure continued throughout 1931 and 1932. Lamont called a special con- ference to which he brought several leading bankers and the endorsement of Hoover to pressure the holdouts into line.

So long as there was no outright governmental compulsion on the textile firms to obey the production quotas, prices could not be raised. By 1932, the cotton textile industry, too, was becoming impatient with its old friend Hoover; the industry was rapidly beginning to agitate for governmental coercion to make cartelization work. 57 This attitude of the cotton textile, petroleum, and agri- cultural industries spread rapidly throughout American industry during 1931 and 1932: an impatience with the pace of America's movement toward the corporate state. Under the impact of the Great Depression, American industry, along with the nation's intellectuals and labor leaders, began to clamor for the outright collectivism of a corporate state; for federal organization of trade associa- tions into compulsory cartels for restricting production and raising prices. In short, a general clamor arose for an economy of fascism. The most important call for the compulsory cartelization of a corporate state was sounded by Gerard Swope, the veteran corporate liberal who headed General Electric. Swope delivered his famous \"Swope Plan\" before the National Electrical Manufacturers Association in the fall of 1931, and it was endorsed by the United States Cham- ber of Commerce in December. 58 Particularly enthusiastic was Henry I.

Lewis and Sidney Hillman, later to form the New Deal-oriented CIO. 61 Dr. Virgil Jordan, economist for the National Industrial Conference Board, summed up the state of business opin- ion when he concluded, approvingly, that businessmen were ready for an \"economic Mussolini.\" 62 In the light of Herbert Hoover's lengthy corporatist career, the business leaders naturally expected him to agree wholeheartedly with the new drive toward business collec- tivism. 63 Hence they were greatly surprised and chagrined to find Hoover sharply drawing back from the abyss, from pursuing the very logic toward which his entire career had been leading. It is not unusual for revolutions to devour their fathers and pioneers. As a revolutionary process accelerates, the early leaders begin to draw back from the implicit logic of their own life work and to leap off the accelerating band- wagon that they themselves had helped to launch.

This Herbert Hoover could not do; and as he saw the new trend he began to fight it, without at all abandon- ing any of his previous positions. Herbert Hoover was being polarized completely out of the accelerating drive toward statism; by merely advancing at a far slower pace, the former \"progressive\" corporatist was now becoming a timid moderate in relation to the swift rush of the ideologi- cal current.

Hence Herbert Hoover's pervasive entry into the public mind as a doughty champion of laissez- faire individualism. 67 It was an ironic ending to the career of one of the great pioneers of American state corporatism. 66 Hoover, Memoirs, Vol. Ill, pp. 334-335- Also see Loth, op. cit., pp. 208-210; Eugene Lyons, Herbert Hoover (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & Co., 1964), pp. 293-294; Myers and Newton, op. cit., pp. 245-256, 488-489. 67 For a penetrating exception to this common view, see William Appleman Williams, The Contours of American History (Cleveland: World Publishing Co., 1961), pp. 385, 415, 425-438."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Myth of the New Deal RONALD RADOSH Great Depression, labor unrest, massive unemployment, growing consciousness among the working classes, bitter hostility toward the multimillion-dollar corporations, fail- ure of the reigning Republican Administration to quiet the brewing explosion—and then the New Deal.

There was no significant redistribution of power in American society, only limited recognition of other organized groups. . . .

It is undeniable that to many of the over-forty genera- tion, Franklin D.

They did not have the tools of historical perspective to evaluate F.D.R.'s actual per- formance, or to understand what historian Paul Conkin has noted: that the New Deal policies actually functioned in a probusiness manner. Conkin wrote: The enemies of the New Deal were wrong. They should have been friends. Security was a prime con- cern of the insecure thirties. It cut across all classes. Businessmen, by their policies, desperately sought it in lowered corporate debts and tried to get the govern- ment to practice the same austerity. Even when ragged and ill-housed, workers opened saving accounts. The New Deal . . . underwrote a vast apparatus of security. But the meager benefits of Social Security were insignificant in comparison to the building sys- tem of security for large, established businesses. But like stingy laborers, the frightened businessmen did not use and enjoy this security and thus increase it. The New Deal tried to frame institutions to protect capitalism from major business cycles and began in an unclear sort of way to underwrite continuous economic growth and sustained profits. Although some tax bills were aimed at high profits, there was no attack on fair profits or even on large profits . . . there was no sig- nificant leveling by taxes. The proportionate distribu- tion of wealth remained. Because of tax policies, even relief expenditures were disguised subsidies to corpo- rations, since they were in large part paid by future taxes on individual salaries or On consumer goods. Thus, instead of higher wages creating a market, at the short-term expense of profits, the government sub- sidized the businessman, without taking the cost out of his hide as he expected and feared. 3 What Conkin was suggesting is that the anger of some businessmen was misdirected; another example of how 3 Paul Conkin, The New Deal (New York: T.

The confusion of the businessmen had its mirror image in the high regard in which so many members of the underclass held F.D.R. and the New Deal. Roosevelt was able, for a while, to build and maintain the famous New Deal coali- tion that swept him into office in 1936. White workers from the North, blacks from the urban ghettos, and farmers from the Midwest all responded to the New Deal and claimed it as their own. Explaining this success as a result of the \"powers of rhetoric,\" as did Bernstein, evades the real question. How could rhetoric alone convince so many that their lives had changed, if indeed, life was the same as it had always been? Perhaps reality did change just enough so that the failure of the New Deal to make substan- tive structural changes remained hidden. Before we can begin to deal with these questions, it may be wise to start by citing the answer presented to the New Left historians by the dean of American corporate liberal- ism, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., author in 1948 of the theory of a crucial \"vital center\" in American politics. Schlesinger has carefully presented his generation's answer to the New Left, and has defended the traditional view that the New Deal was a major watershed in American history. A young radical told him, Schlesinger wrote, that all F.D.R. did was \"abort the revolution by incremental gestures.\" At the same time, he dangerously cultivated a mood for charismatic mass policies, dangerously strengthened the Presidency, dangerously concentrated power in the national government. In foreign affairs, he was an imperialist who went to war against Germany and Japan because they were invading markets required by American capitalism. Claiming that Roosevelt \"will survive this assault from the left as he has survived the earlier assault from the right,\""},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"750 NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN Schlesinger ended with his own brief estimate of F.D.R.'s policies and times. Roosevelt led our nation through a crisis of confidence by con- vincing the American people that they had unsuspected reserves of decency, steadfastness and concern. He de- feated the grand ideologists of his age by showing how experiment could overcome dogma, in peace and in war. 4 Schlesinger's writings help us to understand how those who only mildly benefited from the New Deal praised it, defended it, and allowed their experience during the 1930s to shape their social and political attitudes for more than a decade. Undoubtedly, many Americans have the same analysis of Social Security as does Schlesinger. No government bureau ever directly touched the lives of so many millions of Americans—the old, the jobless, the sick, the needy, the blind, the mothers, the children—with so little confusion or complaint. . . . For all the defects of the Act, it still meant a tremen- dous break with the inhibitions of the past. The federal government was at last charged with the obligation to provide its citizens a measure of protection from the hazards and vicissitudes of life. . . . With the Social Security Act, the constitutional dedication of federal power to the general welfare began a new phase of na- tional history. 5 The assumptions behind Schlesinger's evaluation of So- cial Security are those he revealed years earlier.

But new historical research by a generation of revisionists has all but wiped out this assumption. William Appleman Williams, Gabriel Kolko, James Weinstein, and Murray N. Rothbard have argued that liberalism has actually been the ideology of dominant business groups, and that they have in reality favored state intervention to supervise corporate activity. Liberalism changed from the individualism of laissez-faire to the social control of twentieth-century corporate liberal- ism. Unrestrained ruthless competition from the age of primitive capital accumulation became an anachronism, and the new social and political regulatory measures ema- nating from the Progressive Era were not so much victories for the people over the interests, as examples of movement for state intervention to supervise corporate activity on behalf of the large corporate interests themselves. 7 Just as all historians used to look at the accomplish- ments of the Progressive Era as antibusiness, equating state regulation with regulation over business, and with the assumption that corporate business opposed the new regu- latory acts, so do many historians of the New Deal view the achievements of F.D.R.'s first two terms as a continua- tion of the Progressive tradition. The New Deal thus becomes the culmination of a \"progressive\" process that 6 Arthur M.

Once again, it is assumed that the \"money changers\" whom Roosevelt supposedly drove out of the temple were the New Deal's major opposi- tion, and that government programs were per se progres- sive and part of a new phase of our history. This analysis was stated most strongly by Carl N. Degler, when he referred to the New Deal as the \"Third American Revolution.\" Seeing in the various New Deal measures \"a new conception of the good society,\" Degler claimed pathbreaking significance once the \"nation at large accepted the government as a permanent influence in the economy.\" Is such an influence sufficient to describe the New Deal as revolutionary? To Degler it was. Like Schlesinger, historian Degler saw the Social Security Act as revolutionary because \"it brought government into the lives of people as nothing had since the draft and the income tax.\" Yet another proof of revolutionary effect, even more important, was the \"altera- tion in the position and power of labor.\" Noting that the decline in union growth had come to an end, and that the new spurt in unionism was that of the industrial unionism of the CIO, Degler argued that it was Robert F. Wagner's National Labor Relations Act that \"threw the enormous prestige and power of the government behind the drive for organizing workers.\" The \"placing of the government on the side of unionization,\" Degler wrote, \"was of central importance in the success of many an organizational drive of the CIO, notably those against Ford and Little Steel.\" In summation, the Wagner Act was depicted as revolu- tionary because, prior to the Act, no federal law prevented employers from discharging workers for exercising their rights or from refusing to bargain with a labor union, whereas after the Act was passed, workers had new rights against their employers. The result, according to Degler, was a truly pluralistic structure to American society. \"Big Labor now took its place beside Big Business and Big"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal  153 Government to complete a triumvirate of economic power.\" The Wagner Act particularly revealed that: the government served notice that it would actively participate in securing the unionization of the Ameri- can workers; the state was no longer to be an impartial policeman merely keeping order; it now declared for the side of labor. Although the New Deal used traditional rhetoric, Degler asserted, \"in actuality it was a revolutionary response to a revolutionary situation.\" 8 This estimate was upheld by even such a critical his- torian as William E. Leuchtenburg. Although he modified Degler's analysis a degree, by noting that the Wagner Act was partially motivated by a desire to \"contain 'unbalanced and radical' labor groups,\" Leuchtenburg agreed that the New Deal was a \"radically new departure.\" But to Leucht- enburg, the New Deal had major shortcomings. It failed to demonstrate \"that it could achieve prosperity in peace- time,\" perhaps its greatest failure. The fact that the unem- ployed disappeared only with war production meant to Leuchtenburg that the New Deal was only \"a halfway revolution; it swelled the ranks of the bourgeoisie but left many Americans—sharecroppers, slum dwellers, most Ne- groes—outside of the new equilibrium.\" But, argued Leuchtenburg, it was a revolution anyway. Here, we might raise the question of what type of \"revolution\" is it that fails to deal with the most basic pfoblems produced by the old order, especially when an end to unemployment was the key task confronting the first New Deal, and while there were still by Leuchtenburg's count six million unem- ployed \"as late as 1941.\" 9 8 Carl N.

New Left critics have correctly emphasized the New Deal's failures to destroy some part of the myth. But their critique, valuable as it has been, has failed to take up a more essential question. How does one confront the truth that the New Deal obviously did move in new directions, in some ways quite dramatically, and still keep the old order intact? And how is it that, although the old order remained basically untouched and even preserved, Roosevelt and the New Dealers were able to win the everlasting gratitude of the dispossessed and the white working class? Rather than discuss all of the policies of the New Deal, we can begin to cope with this question by a more thor- ough look at a few key areas, particularly the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the birth of the Con- gress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the origins of the Wagner or National Labor Relations Act, and the passage of the Social Security Act. These three areas have been pointed to as evidence for the pathbreaking if not revolutionary character of the New Deal. Close attention to them should therefore prove most helpful in arriving at a more historically accurate assessment of what the New Deal wrought. Most historians have discussed the Social Security Act in terms of what it offered American citizens for the first time, not in terms of how and why it was passed. Fortu- nately, sociologist G.

Working through reform bodies such as the American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL) and the Fraternal Order of Eagles, model bills for social insurance had been proposed and discussed in the United States as early as 1910—15. These proposals had come to naught. But when the Great Depression hit, the need for reform was clear to all. The first unemployment bill in the United States passed the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1932, and it had evolved from a bill drafted by John R. Commons for the AALL in 1921. In the discussions in Washington, which eventually led to the Social Security Act, AALL members taking part included Paul A. Raushenbush and his wife Elizabeth Brandeis, Henry Dennison, and three New Dealers trained in corporate law, Charles W. Wyzanski, Jr., Thomas H. Eliot, and Thomas G. Corcoran. Wyzanski was graduated from Harvard and Exeter and was with the Boston law firm Ropes, Grey, Boyden and Perkins. Eliot was gradu- ated from Brown, Nichols preparatory school, and Har- vard College, and was a grandson of a former president of Harvard. Corcoran was graduated from Harvard Law School and was with the New York corporate law firm Cotton and Franklin. In June, 1934, Roosevelt appointed a Committee on Economic Security, headed by Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. It included Treasury Secretary Henry Morgen- thau, Jr., Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, Attorney General Homer Cummings, and F.D.R.'s chief aide, Harry Hopkins. They met for the purpose of working on a comprehensive social security and old-age pensions bill. Like any other committee, they depended on advisors, and among their chief aides were men identified closely with the work of the AALL. But the basic outlines of the plan were put forth by F.D.R. himself in his June 6, 1934, message to Congress.

The Committee on Economic Security got to work after F.D.R.'s speech, and met eleven times. On January 15, !935> they presented the President with their report. Two days later, Roosevelt sent his own report to Congress. Roosevelt's proposal was essentially the one prepared by corporate lawyers like Thomas Eliot, who played the major role in drafting the \"bill to carry out the committee's recommendations.\" 11 Yet large-scale opposition to the pro- posed bill came immediately from other business circles, especially from the National Association of Manufacturers. What is important is that liberal historians have tradi- tionally equated the NAM and small-business opposition to social reform legislation as business-community opposition. They have depicted an all-out fight between the forces of big business versus the people; the former opposing and the latter supporting reform. In his book Schlesinger wrote as follows: While the friends of social security were arguing out the details of the program, other Americans were re- garding the whole idea with consternation, if not with horror. Organized business had long warned against such pernicious notions. \"Unemployment insurance cannot be placed on a sound financial basis,\" said the National Industrial Conference Board; it will facilitate \"ultimate socialist control of life and industry,\" said the National Association of Manufacturers. . . . One after another, business leaders appeared before House and Senate Committees to invest such dismal prophecies with what remained of their authority. Republicans in the House faithfully reflected the business position. 12 11 Edwin E.

Particularly important is the backing given the Act by the Business Advisory Council, which formed a committee on Social Security headed by Gerard Swope, president of General Electric, Walter Teagle of Standard Oil, Morris Leeds of the AALL and Robert Elbert. These men were major corporate leaders, or as Domhoff put it, \"some of the most powerful bankers and industrialists in the country.\" These business leaders not only supported the proposed Social Security Act, they visited F.D.R. at the White House to counter the attack on Social Security coming from the NAM and the Chamber of Commerce.

This was because many congressmen and sena- tors reflected their local constituencies, which included local antilabor and small-town mentality NAM business- types. Congress, in other words, did not have the political sophistication of the corporate liberals. Once the bill got to Congress, the setting of minimum state standards in old- age assistance was discarded, as was the concept that states had to select administering personnel on a merit basis. Workers were to contribute half of the old-age pension funds, while employers paid unemployment compensation. But the large corporations would still be able to pass the costs of their contribution to the consumer. Finally, the rich were not to be taxed to help pay for the program. As Domhoff showed, the Social Security Act was the measured response of the moderate members of the power elite to the discontent of the thirties. These moderates took their program, based on models introduced by various corporate policy-making bodies during the previous twenty years, to the Congress. Congress, however, listened more to the NAM-type businessmen. The result was a legislative compromise between the original moderate and conserva- tive position on the Act. Radicals among labor who wanted a comprehensive social-insurance program remained un- satisfied. It was their pressure, however, that induced the moderates to present their plan to Congress. The demands of the poor and the working class provided the steam that finally brought the modified Act to fruition. The result, as Domhoff wrote: 13 \"Business Advisors Uphold President,\" The New York Times, May 3, 1935."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal 159 from the point of view of the power elite was a re- stabilization of the system.

The wealth distribu- tion did not change, decision-making power remained in the hands of upper-class leaders, and the basic principles that encased the conflict were set forth by moderate members of the power elite. Social Security may have been a symbolic measure of the new Welfare State. But, to the corporate liberals in the governing class, it served as the type of legislation that eased tension, created stability, and prevented or broke any movements for radical structural change. Hence, it served an essentially conservative purpose because it helped main- tain the existing system of production and distribution. The pattern of corporate support to New Deal programs is even more vivid when we consider the first great pro- gram initiated by the New Deal to produce recovery, the National Recovery Administration.

All companies engaged in manufacturing and commercial enterprises could form one trade association supervised by a federal commission that would outline trade practices, as well as proper business ethics. Federal legislation had to be passed that would suspend the Sherman Antitrust Law and permit manufac- turers to combine for the purpose of making agreements. Swope also revealed that he favored establishment of a \"national economic council\" that would enable trade asso- ciations to interact and permit coordination between differ- ent industries. Companies within one industry would join together in their own trade association to coordinate pro- duction, consumption, and unemployment benefits. Each association would then elect delegates to a national body that would meet together \"and choose from amongst them- selves, or from outside, a national economic council.\" Trade associations were the \"natural organizations to study the economic elements of each industry.\" Each would hold itself responsible for coordination of produc- tion and consumption to stabilize industry. They would then be the foundation stones upon which to erect the superstructure of the national economic council. This might be created by bringing together officers, or duly elected representatives of these various associations to choose a council that would study the needs of industry as a whole. The men would come up through industry itself and would be able to work to solve their problems. \"If you do that for each of the various industries,\" Swope commented, \"and then have a similar body from the bank- ing group, from the transportation, labor,\" and other cerned ... to preserve private property for power and private profit,\" even though it \"cuts the ground\" from old-style compet- itive capitalism.

In es- sence it would function through an elite group, the leaders of the different functional economic groups. Although they would make major decisions and all groups were to be represented, decision-making would remain within the hands of the elite who ruled for the society at large. Swope was seeking an end to the imbalance caused by blunt con- tests for power between the various groups, each jockeying for more for itself from the state's administrators. He wanted to substitute corporate cooperation and mold previ- ously warring constituencies into one corporate body. He sought, in plain language, an American corporate state. As such, his views paralleled the developments in Italy. In that fascist country, trade associations were called corporations, and given power to regulate all operations. The corporation was to be ruled by a representative group of employers and workers. The difference was that, in Italy, three members had to belong to the Fascist Party, and the major presiding officer was to be appointed by the Prime Minister. 16 During the 1930s, many liberals viewed fascist economic theory as a promising alternative to what they considered the twin evils of an unreconstructed laissez-faire capitalism and a rampant increase of socialism. To such liberals, John P. Diggins has explained, fascism appeared to be a continuous creative effort that found its affirmation in the subordination of end to means. In its attempt to strike a balance between the dogmas of capitalism and socialism, moreover, Fascism avoided doctrinal myopia.

To liberals, fascism appeared to be a system of planning that transcended classes and led to an equilibrium of con- tending social forces. Thus it was \"essentially the theoreti- cal appeals of corporatism that interested\" the liberals. 17 It is no accident that the early New Deal was character- ized by the introduction of planning techniques that had antecedents in trade associations developed within industry during the Hoover years. Bernard Baruch's War Industries Board and the Hoover trade associations reached fruition with F.D.R.'s NRA. Men who had been involved with wartime planning were brought back to government ser- vice. \"In quest of a precedent for government-business cooperation,\" Leuchtenburg wrote, the draftsmen of the recovery bill turned to the ex- perience with industrial mobilization in World War I. Swope himself had served in a war agency, and his plan was one of many . . . which drew on recollec- tions of government coordination of the economy during the war. Since they rejected laissez-faire, yet shrank from embracing socialism, the planners drew on the experience of the War Industries Board because it offered an analogue which provided a maximum of government direction with a minimum of challenge to the institutions of a profit economy. 18 William McAdoo, who had been Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of Commerce, thus wrote Bernard Baruch in 1931 to suggest a new permanent organization of a \"peace- time board or national economic council\" that would revise the antitrust laws.

But in building upon the past epoch, he was building upon a probusiness program. The War Industries Board, Leuchtenburg has aptly pointed out, had, after all, been run chiefly by business executives. If they learned anything from the war, it was not the virtues of collectivism but the potentialities of trade associations, the usefulness of the state in economic warfare with the traders of other nations, and the good-housekeeping practices of eliminating duplica- tion and waste. The immediate consequence of the war was not a New Jerusalem of the planners but the Whiggery of Herbert Hoover as Secretary of Com- merce. While the war mobilization did establish mean- ingful precedents for New Deal reforms, it was hardly the \"war socialism\" some theorists thought it to be. Perhaps the outstanding characteristic of the war or- ganization of industry was that it showed how to achieve massive government intervention without mak- ing any permanent alteration in the power of the cor- porations. 20 19 William McAdoo to Bernard Baruch, June 10, 1931; McAdoo to Raphael Herman, June 10, 1931; Herman to McAdoo, June 8, 1931, William McAdoo MSS (Library of Congress), box 359. 2( > William E.

As Leuchtenburg went on to state, the New Dealers also rejected class struggle, as well as \"mass action and socialist planning, and assumed a community of inter- est of the managers of business corporations and the directors of government agencies.\" They feared not dis- credited conservatives, but the \"antiplutocratic move- ments,\" or we might put it, the forces of the radical left. 21 Hence the New Deal cartelization efforts, which culmi- nated in NRA. One of NRA's major architects was Donald Richberg, who had been chosen for his position because of his prolabor background. But again, Richberg's commitment to labor lay within the framework of the corporate state. As a young Chicago lawyer, Richberg had written both the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and later the Norris-LaGuar- dia Act of 1932. He was chosen to help frame the NRA, Schlesinger pointed out, because Hugh Johnson wanted Richberg because \"he assumed that Richberg had the confidence of labor and liberals.\" No other early ap- pointment of F.D.R.'s, Schlesinger concluded, gave \"more satisfaction to labor and liberals than that of Richberg.\" 22 As a prolabor formulator of the NRA, Richberg re- vealed his private vision of a new corporate state, but one in which industrial unions would have to become the pre- requisite for an American corporatism. \"If industrial workers were adequately organized,\" he explained, \"it would be entirely practical to create industrial councils composed of representatives of managers, investors and workers and then to create a national council composed of similar representatives of all essential industries.\" In this council, \"all producing and consuming interests would be so represented that one group could hardly obtain sanction 21 Ibid., p. 130. 22 Schlesinger, The Coming of the New Deal, pp. 98, 106, 162- 163."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal  165 for a policy clearly contrary to the general welfare.\" Rich- berg was critical of craft-union leaders. He wished they had \"seized\" labor's great \"opportunity to organize the unemployed,\" and simply ignore \"the hampering tradition of craft unionism\" by organizing men and women \"denied their inherent right to work.\" Labor should have demanded that \"their government should no longer be controlled by rulers of commerce and finance who have utterly failed to meet their obligations.\" If such a movement had been built, if labor had created one \"mighty arm and voice\" of the \"unemployed millions,\" Congress would have listened to the dispossessed. Richberg also forecast the conservative role that indus- trial unions would play. \"Let me warn those who desire to preserve the existing order,\" he cautioned, \"but intend to do nothing to reform it, that if this depression continues much longer the unemployed will be organized and action of a revolutionary character will be demanded.\" To avoid that, people had to be put back to work and mass purchas- ing power had to be increased. The solution was to mobi- lize the nation \"through the immediate creation of a national planning council, composed of representatives of major economic interests who recognize the necessity of a planned economy.\" 23 The need: to avoid radicalism. The means: a formal American corporate state, or the NRA. The NRA, which became law on June 16, 1933, was the agency meant to evolve into a corporate state. The NRA, John T. Flynn perceptively noted in 1934, was based on the need of businessmen to have the government control prices, production, and trade practices. \"Industry wanted not freedom from regulation,\" he wrote, \"but the right to enjoy regulation.\" Modification of antitrust laws was de- 23 Donald Richberg, \"Depression: Causes and Remedies,\" sub- mitted February 23, 1933, to the Senate Committee on Finance, U.S., Senate, Committee on Finance, Investigation of Economic Problems, 72nd Cong., 2nd sess., 1933, pp. 643-652."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"l66  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN sired \"so that employers might unite to fabricate and enforce regimentation of industry through trade associa- tions.\" The NRA also developed plans for shorter working hours and payment of minimum wages; but Flynn noted that it was \"pure fiction\" that such legislation was forced on big business against its will. Actually, the corporations wanted the opportunity to force the NRA on the \"unwill- ing ten percent\" of smaller operators who competed un- fairly by cutting costs through wage reductions. The NRA, Flynn remarked, represented almost \"entirely the influence and ideal of big businessmen.\" 24 The program of the large corporate community, as political scientist Eugene Golob put it, revealed that \"the basic idea of corporatism had been accepted as part of the American scene.\" Defining corporatism as \"the organiza- tion of the economic functions of society into groupings of labor and management for each industry,\" Golob noted 24 John T.

Swenson, \"The Chamber of Commerce and the New Deal,\" The Annals, CLXXIX (May, 1935), pp. 136-143. Swenson similarly argued that the Chamber of Commerce program for relaxation of antitrust laws had been accomplished with the NRA, as well as that of planning through trade associations. With the ex- ception of the collective-bargaining provision, which Swenson correctly observed \"was subsequently robbed of much of its original strength,\" he argued with Flynn that the NRA \"repre- sented almost entirely the influence and ideal of big business- men.\" An interesting comment on the NRA was offered by A. A. Berle, Jr., \"What's Behind the Recovery Laws?\" Scribner's, XCIV (September, 1933), pp. 131-133. \"The machinery of the industrial system has been called . . . Guild Fascism.

Ekirch, Jr., has called their widespread confidence in the broad nature and humanitarian goals of the New Deal's planning. Al- though Roosevelt proposed to use the methods of big business and of wartime regimentation, his purpose included more jobs and better working conditions along with business recovery. 26 In the Senate, laissez-faire liberals led by Senator Wil- liam E.

They were challenged by the Senate corporate liberals. Robert F. Wagner (D., N.Y.) angrily replied that NRA was the \"first step toward that which the liberals of the country have been preparing for years.\" Wagner claimed that the NRA idea was part of the Progressive Party platform in 1912. It meant essentially the \"necessity of a national planned economy,\" without which there would not be \"an orderly organized economic system.\" He therefore favored ending restrictions on business combinations that were placed upon industry by the antitrust laws. Competition would then be put \"upon a higher plane.\" Sweatshops would be eliminated and efficient production would prevail. 27 Even after the NRA was placed under the direction of General Hugh Johnson, an old associate of Bernard Baruch's in the WIB, the corporate liberals did not become increasingly suspicious. Johnson began the campaign to have the entire nation accept the codes of fair competition to be drawn up by each industry. Under his reign the famous Blue Eagle was developed to popularize the NRA. \"In the national effort to break the force of the depression via the NRA codes,\" Ekirch commented, \"little attention was paid to the fact that it was industry itself that had largely prepared the regulations governing prices and pro- duction,\" and that the NRA meant \"the suspension of the antitrust laws along with the whole theory of free competi- tion and free enterprise.\" 28 But the corporate background of the NRA was a theme always enunciated by the NRA leaders themselves. To Donald Richberg, the need of the hour was a new form of representative government based upon \"the free function- ing of the representatives of all interests.\" The nation would then have devised a \"method of industrial self- 27 U.S., House, Committee on Ways and Means, National In- dustrial Recovery, 73rd Cong., 1st sess., 1933, pp. 95-98. 28 Ekirch, op. cit., p. 276."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal  169 control which will last long after the present experiments in political control in other nations have disappeared.\" 29 Richberg admitted that he had been asked to help draft the NRA because he was familiar with the operation of antitrust laws, and he understood that a consensus existed \"among the managers of industry and the workers\" that relief had to be gained from their existence. Agreements were needed among business to eliminate unfair practices and establish price levels, but such action was illegal under existing law. Richberg was concerned about protecting industry against the \"complete uncertainty as to what could be legitimately done by a trade\" association that desired stabilization of industry. Although he preferred not to compare the result of ending antitrust restrictions with European cartels, Richberg admitted that \"in a general way it has that tendency,\" since there would be no prosecution against industries which combined to fix prices if the prices established were related to costs of production. 30 The NRA reformers, unlike our contemporary liberal historians, understood that their program was meant to be a conservative prop to the existing order. They also real- ized the dire need to include social reform as an essential component of the corporate state. They understood that many liberals and even political radicals would overlook the conservative origin and effect of the NRA if reform, especially public works, was offered as part of a package deal. Hence Title I of the NRA promoted the organiza- tion of industry to achieve cooperative action among trade associations, and it included the codes of fair competition and exemption of industry from prosecution under the antitrust laws.

Harriman, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, argued that there was \"ample justification for a reasonable public works program\" in conjunction with a corporate plan that would free industry from antitrust restrictions. If there was any doubt that the large corporations would support a program that would result in wage increases along with a fair return on dividends, Harriman assured reluctant congressmen that the \"big ones will rush to it.\" 31 But the problem was to win the allegiance not of the big ones, but of the \"liberals.\" The means to this end was the technique of public works. Of all the New Deal reforms, public works seemed to most people to have the aura of \"socialism\" or at least of an attack on private interests. To the hungry and unemployed, it symbolized a direct concern by the government for their plight. That public works, as Murray N. Rothbard has shown, was introduced effectively by the Hoover Administration was unrecognized. That the New Deal's public works was of a limited nature and did not interfere with private business prerogatives went un- noticed. In the area in which public-works development was most needed, housing, the New Deal program was hardly successful and in many ways a total failure. All this was ignored. The name \"public works\" and the PWA itself produced a sympathetic response from the populace, the \"liberal\" political groups, and the organized political left. The commitment to support reform if the liberals and radicals would cease criticism of the NRA was understood by Donald Richberg. In a private draft prepared for the committee that drew up the NRA legislation, Richberg suggested that \"it would be at least a tactical error not to begin the bill with a public works program,\" with the pro- vision for trade agreements following as further stimulation to industrial stabilization. \"If this is not done,\" he ex- Ibid., pp. 134-153."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal 171 plained, \"the reaction of the host of people expecting, advocating and convinced of the value of public works will be antagonistic to the general program.\" If industrial control leads off, with public works as a secondary, incidental part of the program, it will be difficult to avoid violent opposition from those now clamoring for public works who might swallow a somewhat \"fascist\" proposal to get their \"democratic\" measure of relief. 32 In using the very terms that he expected opponents to denounce the NRA with in the future, Richberg added that he was being facetious. Nevertheless, he was showing awareness that the Administration knew that reformers would acquiesce in the corporate state if reform was part of its program. Richberg and his contemporaries, including the laissez- faire opponents of the NRA, were both correct. NRA was conservative. It is true, as Leuchtenburg wrote, that NRA gave jobs to two million workers, stopped renewal of a deflationary spiral and established a national pattern of maximum hours and minimum wages, thus wiping out child labor and the hated sweatshops. But as he added, the NRA did not speed recovery, and probably actually hindered it by its support of re- striction-minded businessmen moved into a decisive position of authority. By delegating power over price and production to trade associations, the NRA created a series of private economic governments .... The large corporations which dominated the code authorities used their powers to stifle competi- tion, cut back production, and reap profits from price- raising rather than business expansion. 33 32 Memorandum, n.d., 1933, Richberg MSS (Library of Con- gress). 33 Leuchtenburg, Franklin D.

It also matched the criticism offered after the NRA's development by journalist Walter Lippmann, laissez- faire critic John T. Flynn, and the conservative AF of L labor leader, Matthew Woll. As Woll noted at the time, under the NRA codes monopoly had grown, cartelization of the economy had been encouraged, and \"corporate con- trol had been permitted to strengthen its grip upon the economic life of the nation.\" The cartelization of Ameri- can industry taking place under the codes, he wrote, was a familiar story in the early history of Mussolini's Italy. \"Are we,\" Woll queried, \"heading toward a business Fascism?\" 34 Only our contemporary liberal historians, even when they acknowledge the loopholes in the New Deal programs, present the New Deal in a positive fashion. Perhaps it should not be surprising that conservatives in the 1930s had a more realistic appraisal of the New Deal and the basic function it served. Thus a conservative Chicago lawyer, Charles LeRoy Brown, wrote Donald Richberg an approving letter regarding New Deal policies. Brown was a particularly insightful conservative. Describing himself as a lifelong Republican who had become \"disgusted\" with the \"hypocrisy and ineffectiveness\" of the leadership shown by the conservative classes, Brown explained: I think I am still a conservative, but I believe that a new set of plans is essential to preserve the con- servative order of things. The trouble is that most of our business and professional friends do not under- stand that the old methods will not serve. New arrangements are necessary to save the economic structure.

Later developments and characteristics of American society which suggest an opposite conclusion are no more than the full extension and maturation of much earlier ideas and policies that were brought together in what a high New Dealer called a shotgun approach to dealing with the depression. 36 Unlike Brown and Williams, most of our contemporary historians do not seem to realize that institution of \"a new set of plans\" is conservative, not to speak of not being radical or revolutionary. But what happens when an area emerges where the \"old methods\" are entirely done away with? Can one rightly call such an area of innovation revo- lutionary? As Degler has argued, this is indeed the case with organized labor, and the passage of the Wagner or National Labor Relations Act. More than any other piece of New Deal legislation, the policy toward labor seemed to suggest a new revolutionary stance toward the worker on the part of government. In reality, the role played by the Wagner Act was the same as that of the NRA and the other conservative New Deal programs. It was the Wagner Act that allowed the Administration to obtain the final integration of organized labor into the existing political economy of corporation capitalism.

Craft unions grew only 13 percent between 1933 and 1935, as against 132 percent by the AFofL's four industrial unions and 125 percent for their semi-industrial unions. The NRA provided the original impetus to organization. Between July and August, 1933, the AFofL issued 340 new charters to affiliated local trade and federal labor unions, and Green estimated that in two months AF of L membership increased by about 1,500,000 members. 37 With the NRA, the federal government took over the traditional organizing function that had previously been an exclusive union domain. The old AF of L craft unions had refused to initiate a widespread program of unioniza- tion in unorganized basic industries. But now the New Deal was seeking a labor movement that would gain work- ing-class support and provide the necessary structural parallel to industry that would allow integration of the labor force into the new system. The New Deal, contempo- rary reporter Benjamin Stolberg observed, \"needed orga- nized labor to save big business.\" While the NRA was a \"price fixing mechanism to enable big industry to regain the control of scarcity,\" it needed big labor to police \"the 'social planning' of stabilizing prices in an economic sys- tem\" that was \"partly irresponsibly competitive and partly dictatorially monopolistic.\" Thus the NRA turned the labor movement \"into a semipublic unionism whose orga- nization was part of a government program.\" 38 The government became heavily involved, through the early NRA efforts, in the traditional function of union organization.

But unlike the Social Security Act, which ob- tained an overwhelming corporate consensus for its sup- port, many members of the governing class were not friendly to union organization.

As chieftain of one of the key multimillion-dollar corporations, Swope was quite an important figure in the corporate community. Herbert Hoover had stood fast against introduction of his plan, viewing it as a stepping stone toward a business fas- cism. But during F.D.R.'s Administration, Swope began to get results. As early as 1926, Swope had sought to convince AF of L president William Green to form a nationwide union of electrical workers organized on an industrial basis. He felt that having an industrial union might mean \"the difference between an organization with which we could work on a businesslike basis and one that would be a source of end- less difficulties.\" 41 William Green, because he had to maintain his commit- ment to the craft unions comprising the AF of L, rejected Swope's pleas. Swope preferred industrial organization for one simple reason: he saw his industry \"intolerably handi- capped if the bulk of our employees were organized into different and often competing craft unions.\" They could deal easily with one bargaining agent, but not with more than one dozen. When the CIO was eventually built and the left-led United Electrical Workers began to organize General Electric, Swope rejoiced. He informed one of his vice-presidents that \"if you can't get along with these fellows and settle matters, there's something wrong with you.\" The UEW was praised by Swope as \"well led, the discipline good.\" 42 40 Domhoff, op. cit., p. 249. 41 David Loth, Swope of GE (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1958), p. 168. 42 Ibid., pp. 172, 259."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Myth of the New Deal The left-led leadership of UEW-CIO thought as highly of Swope.

Whereas William Green opposed the amendment because he feared it would reduce the hourly earnings of well-paid skilled labor, Swope supported it because he knew that the AF of L did not represent unskilled labor. The bill was a necessity, Swope argued, since out of the \"millions of men employed in industry, a very small proportion is in the American Federation of Labor.\" The legislation was on behalf of the unskilled worker \"who needs protection . . . those who have no organization working for them.\" Congress, Swope said, had to act on the behalf of the \"millions of men who are not members\" of the AF of L and \"for whom no one is talking.\" 44 Because Swope recognized the necessity of integrating the working class into the existing corporate system, he helped develop the mechanism that would be written into the Wagner Act. It was Swope who proposed creation of a National Labor Relations Board to supervise labor rela- tions, as well as the method of holding secret-ballot elec- tions in factories to judge which group was the accurate representative of organized labor.

Then the company would be forced to deal with more than fifteen different craft unions. Swope could not see his way clear to invite all of them to or- ganize his highly mechanized industry, and then to watch them wreck it in \"jurisdictional disputes.\" He wanted some sort of industrial union form of organi- zation. Swope again asked William Green to organize General Electric on an industry-wide basis, but the AF of L re- fused. \"Just what Mr. Swope thought of the intelligence of our labor oligarchy,\" Stolberg commented, \"is not re- ported.\" 46 Swope understood what many contemporary historians do not.

The existence of such an industrial unionism benefited the long-range interests of the corporations.

They simply preferred to deal with their own unions organized indus- trially rather than with \"legitimate\" trade unions organized on a craft basis. This preference was made clear by none other than Walter C. Teagle, president of Standard Oil of New Jersey.

In a report presented to Senator Robert F.

As late as March, 1934, when the AF of L had already publicly attacked the NRA for spreading company union- ism, Frey was still optimistic. He had more reason than other union leaders to complain about inadequate NRA code provisions, and about noncompliance on the part of employers who ignored the NRA regulations on labor. Yet he wrote that what the NRA had accomplished in \"chang- ing the employers point of view on industrial relations ... is an extraordinary tribute to [the NRA staff's] capacity.\" The National Labor Board bluntly told em- ployers to accept unions.

But only unions that were indus- trially organized, and which paralleled in their structure the organization of industry itself, could play the appropri- ate role. A successful corporate state required a safe industrial-union movement to work. It also required a union leadership that shared the desire to operate the economy from the top in formal conferences with the leaders of the other functional economic groups, particu- larly the corporate leaders. The CIO unions, led by Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, provided such a union leadership. 50 It was for this reason that the moderates in the govern- ing class pushed for passage of the Wagner Act. As Domhorf noted, the anti-union diehards did have leverage for one major reason. From the point of view of the employers, it had to be an all or nobody proposition, for any holdouts would supposedly have the competitive advantage brought about by lower wage costs. Thus, the diehards held great power over the majority, making it ultimately necessary to legislate against them. Perhaps there is something to the claim that most employers would go along with union recognition if all their compatriots would. But not every employer would go along, which set the stage for the battle over the Wagner Act, a 49 Frey to Walter A.

After a vast amount of strikes occurred, they refused to heed the many calls for sending in troops. The result was that the diehards were forced into negotiation and compromise. Roosevelt even accused the NAM forces of trying to precipitate a general strike. But in refusing to stand with the antilabor groups, Roosevelt was not the master broker, a man who favored \"a balance between business and labor\"; rather, he was an integral member of the upper class and its power elite. However, he was a member of that part of the power elite that had chosen a more moderate course in at- tempting to deal with the relationship of labor and capital. . . . While he did not encourage unionism, his record during the thirties makes very clear, he was nonetheless unwilling to smash it in the way the NAM had hoped to do since 1902. Referring back to Roosevelt's prolabor ideology formed during World War I, when he was a member of the Execu- tive Board of the National Civic Federation, Domhoff noted that when the \"time came for choosing, he and the moderate members of the power elite chose bargaining rather than repression.\" 52 One of the major architects of the act, therefore, was a highly regarded, young upper-class lawyer, Lloyd K.

He felt that the NRA was at its end, and that new legislation was needed to guarantee labor the right to organize and bargain collectively. Wagner, Biddle, corpo- rate lawyer Simon Rifkind, economist Leon Keyserling, and lawyer Calvert Magruder drew up the bill that gave the NLRB the power to prohibit unfair labor practices and to enforce its decisions. When the hearings on the Wagner Act were held, Garri- son gave an insight into the reason that some elements of the governing class favored it. Organized labor, he told the congressmen, was a bulwark against radical movements. Also, the purchasing power of labor had to be increased to get industry back on its feet. Taken together, these were two eminently conservative reasons for a major piece of reform legislation. 54 At the hearings, Wagner produced support from the Twentieth Century Fund, a major corpo- rate-liberal policy group.

Once the Supreme Court voted in favor of the Act, the NLRB, an administra- tive body, became the final arbitrator of all labor disputes. This was, as Domhoff wrote, the \"favorite solution of the moderate members of the power elite, the 'nonpolitical' administrative body or regulatory agency.\" 55 Thus Biddle noted that the feature of the act attacked as the most radical was in fact the least novel—the provisions authorizing the Board to request a court to enforce its order, which derived from the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. 56 Even before the Court decision favorable to the Act, F.D.R. had moved to conciliate diehards among the elite. Working through Thomas Lamont, Roosevelt made over- tures toward United States Steel. Lamont brought F.D.R. and U.S. Steel president Myron Taylor together, and a contract with the Steelworkers was signed on March 3, 1937, one month before the Court decision. Only Little Steel held out on its anti-union course. Roosevelt similarly worked with Bill Knudsen, head of General Motors, and with Walter P. Chrysler, who backed him in the 1936 election.

This was made clear in the 1960s by Leon Keyser- ling, who had been legislative assistant to Robert F. Wag- ner during the 1930s and who helped the group that formulated the Wagner Act's principles. In i960, econo- mist Keyserling called for a \"new national agency to embody top level discussions among those who hoped that such a body would move the country away from fruitless wrangles between competing groups.\" He hoped that a new agency would bring the \"organized powers in our enter- prise system,\" unions and trade associations, into a \"rela- tionship of participation and concert with the efforts of government.\" He then noted that this was the goal fought for by Wagner during the 1930s. 58 This detailed examination of the roots of the Wagner Act, as well as the NRA and the Social Security Act, should help us to assess the meaning of the New Deal. We now should be able to answer some of the questions raised earlier.

That is, indeed, the very meaning of reform. But reform is not revolution. Revolution means a sub- stantive fundamental change in the existing social structure, a massive dislocation and revamping of the existing system of production and distribution. Schlesinger's \"New Left\" student, if he is quoted correctly, has emphasized the wrong issue. The New Deal reforms were not mere \"incre- mental gestures.\" They were solidly based, carefully worked out pieces of legislation. They were of such a character that they would be able to create a long-lasting mythology about the existence of a pluralistic American democracy, in which big labor supposedly exerts its countering influence to the domination that otherwise would be undertaken by big industry. One cannot explain the success of the New Deal by pointing to its rhetoric. The populace responded to F.D.R.'s radical rhetoric only because it mirrored their own deeply held illusions. They could not comprehend how the reforms that changed their lives only worked to bolster the existing political economy, and they did not realize that many sponsors of the reforms came from the corporation community themselves. The integration of seemingly disparate elements into the system was success- ful. Labor did get its share and it did benefit from the development of a permanent war economy and the military- industrial complex. Many of those who lived through and benefited from the New Deal most likely view its accom- plishments in much the same way as Schlesinger or Carl Degler. One can never be sure whether they reflect the explanations offered by the \"vital center\" historians, or whether these historians merely reflect the false conscious- ness of their own epoch.

The moderates in the governing class had to put up a stubborn, prolonged fight until the law would be able to reflect the realities of the new epoch of corporation capitalism. That many on the political left viewed the New Deal as \"progressive\" or \"neosocialist\" is also no clue to the mean- ing of New Deal policies. Like the small businessmen, the left was a victim of its own particular myths, and its sup- port of F.D.R. cannot tell us anything about New Deal policies either. It may reveal the essential liberalism of the 1930s left, but this is another story. The failure of con- temporaries properly to evaluate the epoch in which they live is traditional. One can never, as Karl Marx warned, evaluate an era by concentrating on the consciousness of an era's major protagonists. The New Deal was conserva- tive. Its special form of conservatism was the development of reforms that modernized corporate capitalism and brought corporate law to reflect the system's changed nature. To many, these New Deal reforms seemingly proved that the system had changed its basic essentials. As we move into the era of a fully matured corporate capi- talism, whose contradictions are just beginning to emerge, it has become easier to see what the New Deal accom- plished. Only in an epoch where consciousness begins to soar beyond the capitalist marketplace can a critique of the major reform era that marketplace had to offer emerge. This is such an epoch.

A clue to the corporate-liberal individual is given in the following descriptions. Robert Brookings, the millionaire who founded the Brookings Institution, was described by the director of that Institution: Mr. Brookings never revealed any emotional basis for his interest in social welfare; he was not a profes- sional uplifter; and he always retained a sense of realism. His animating philosophy—which I hope may always pervade this Institution—may best be charac- terized as constructive liberalism. 1 Magnus Alexander, an engineer and assistant to the presi- dent of General Electric, and first Chairman of the Na- 1 Robert Somers Brookings — Memorial Addresses Delivered at the Brookings Institution, May 19, 1933 (Pamphlet, Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1933), p. 20."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Planning for the Establishment l8g tional Industrial Conference Board, was described as the same sort of hardheaded reformer by one of his colleagues. Alexander always recognized sentiment as a factor, he re- called, but he never permitted humanitarian sympathy to obscure his judgment. He understood what many men may not grasp and some will not accept—that the urge for progressive change is inherent in human nature. Ra- tional reform must come from within, or some form of correction will be imposed from without. 2 These two men are prime examples of the Progressive Era corporate liberal. The corporate-liberal doctrine that was shaped in that era was at once a compound of negative and positive elements; negative in its abiding fear of \"out- side\" correction, which meant, ultimately, socialism. The more sophisticated corporate liberal was, in part, a liberal because he was able to acknowledge the appeal of social- ism and realized that it could only be countered by a rational and moral capitalism. But a more important com- ponent in the corporate-liberal outlook than this essentially negative reaction to the socialist threat (although one that cannot really be separated from this reaction) was the positive notion that American capitalism could, in fact, be reformed. What distinguished the corporate-liberal re- former from the more traditional political-liberal reformer who proceeded from principles of humanitarianism, jus- tice, or from even more rarified political principles, was the corporate liberal's starting point in the needs of corpora- tion capitalism. To the corporate liberal, American indus- try had to be made more rational and efficient because the unrestrained capitalism typical of the nineteenth century was simply too costly and too wasteful to endure over the 2 Charles Nagel, \"Memorial Address to the National Industrial Conference Board,\" October 27, 1932, NICB — Sixteenth Annual Report (New York: National Industrial Conference Board, 1933), P- 32."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"190  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN long run. He was, in other words, a self-interested re- former. To the corporate liberal, dishonest politicians and cor- ruption in city, state, and federal governments were both inefrlcient and expensive. The reckless exploitation of natu- ral resources was an inefficient use of a limited supply of raw materials. A dissatisfied labor force that was under- paid, harshly worked, and driven to strikes and to radical political action because its basic needs were disregarded meant extra production costs and—perhaps more impor- tant—costs that could not be calculated in advance. American basic industry could no longer tolerate the prac- tices of the nineteenth-century type of robber barons who would hastily build a business, inflate stock beyond the earning capacity of the enterprise, bilk hapless investors, and flee with the proceeds before they themselves were caught in the falling wreckage. Large corporations meant mass sales in a national and international market. Con- servative businessmen had to be concerned with the long run and with careful cost accounting. Most of all, this newly interdependent and relatively sensitive economy de- manded stability. Inefficiency and waste prevented stability. A restive labor force meant instability. And a properly functioning, profitable, rationalized business society not only could, but must, eliminate these \"unbusinesslike\" instabilities. But there was more to corporate liberalism than this, so far, rather straightforwardly cost-accounting approach to reform. Also implied in this view, and later made explicit by Herbert Croly and others, was a broader notion of corporate responsibility to a national political-economic system. This aspect of corporate liberalism saw American society as an entity made up of corporate units—business, labor, farmers, and government. The ground from which all else proceeded was corporation capitalism and the responsibility of all the corporate units to that system and its continued prosperity, or profitability; and so the busi-"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Planning for the Establishment 191 ness section of this entity was by far the most important. But for the sake of the corporate whole, each unit had a real responsibility to the others. This was an American corporation that held, for example, that business needed labor and would recognize and legitimize labor (and per- haps even labor unions of the proper sort) and would grant better wages and working conditions in return for labor's cooperation and modest demands. Business would allow the government (in which the corporate units would participate) to regulate \"destructive\" competition and pro- vide other standards that would increase prosperity and stability. As hardhearted as most of the corporate-liberal attitude sounds (and was), it did contemplate genuine political-economic reforms and it embodied genuinely different relations between business and labor, and business and government than had been true in the nineteenth- century American version of laissez-faire. It must be understood, however, that corporate liberalism was not the automatic outcome of a genteel academic debate. On the one hand, the corporate liberal was in constant battle with the individualist, or conservative, businessman who could not accept government as a positive force in creating corporate stability. Corporate liberalism was also, and most importantly, a product of unremitting class struggle and pressure from labor and other groups who demanded more change than reformers were ever willing to match. The corporate liberal, then, was a reformer who was motivated by a fairly rational fear of the socialist appeal; by his own immediate interest in stability and profits; and by his understanding that the long-range stability of the capitalist structure could only be ensured through a na- tional corporate political-economic responsibility. And he was brought to this position by outside demands. Thus it was that the corporate liberal came to advocate many of the same reforms proposed by political liberals; although, as James Weinstein has said (in The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State: 1900—1918), it was the corporate liberal"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"I$2  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN who dominated and defined twentieth-century reform. But the corporate liberal's premises were, and are, very differ- ent from those of the political liberal. The political liberal based his reforms on a set of more or less abstract political principles. He defined himself as outside the existing politi- cal economy. He was for justice. He felt, at least, that he could attack or defend business at will because he was an independent arbiter or referee, detached from the system (detached, one is tempted to add, from history itself). Of the two, the corporate liberal was the only class-conscious reformer. He was, therefore, the more effective of the two. All seven of the research groups to be discussed here were started, sustained, and, in varying degrees, staffed by corporate-liberal businessmen. At the outset most of these organizations quickly developed intimate relations with the government, business, and academic communities. Their officers and staff members came from all three of these categories—often being employed in two or even three of them simultaneously. Most of these organizations were founded in the Progressive Era in response to an increased need for facts and analyses upon which to base prudent corporate-liberal reform. There were differences between them, but they all shared the same ideology. The National Industrial Conference Board was founded in 1916 by a group of trade associations to give the \"largely inarticulate\" business community its own research area. 3 The group feared the rise of labor, but it also wished to gather and present \"facts and conditions\" that would \"serve to shape and to guide a normal development\" of industry. 4 It also helped Woodrow Wilson in establishing and staffing the War Labor Board. Despite its conservatism 3 Magnus Alexander, \"The National Industrial Conference Board, A Record of Ten Years of Service to American Industry, May, 1916-May, 1926,\" NICB — Tenth Annual Report (New York: National Industrial Conference Board, 1927), p. 17. 4 Nagel, op. cit., p. 32."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Planning for the Establishment 193 in the early postwar years and in the 1930s and 1940s, the NICB possessed a strong current of corporate liberalism. In 1926, for example, Magnus Alexander remarked that the Board has' emphasized more than ever the social responsi- bility of the employer to his employees and the com- munity. It has helped to do away with class spirit, all too evident in the industry of the past, and to intro- duce a more human as well as a more scientific atti- tude into industry. 5 By the 1950s this attitude became predominant and the NICB wholeheartedly joined the prevailing corporate- liberal consensus. Unlike the overtly business-oriented Conference Board, the National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to provide broad but basic analysis and facts that would serve as a basis for wise reforms. It was concerned with \"quantification\" rather than policy, and it has sus- tained a reputation as the purest and most scientific of all the research groups. Its relation to policy-makers has always been close, however; from its early aid to the Presi- dent's unemployment conferences in the 1920s, to its studies of business cycles and how to avoid them, to studies of economic growth and how to sustain it, to direc- tions like Arthur F. Burns and others who have been drawn into policy-making positions in government. The Brookings Institution represented a merging in 1927 of three groups maintained by Robert Brookings. It was like the National Bureau in striving for impartiality, but it made no pretense that it was avoiding an interest in policy. But, as was true with all seven research organizations except the National Industrial Conference Board, the Brookings groups received substantial aid from the major foundations. The first Brookings group was the Institute 5 Alexander, op. cit., p. 26."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"194 NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN for Government Research. It was organized in 1916 by corporate-liberal businessmen, government officials, and scholars who wished to improve the efficiency of the fed- eral government in the same spirit that they had instituted municipal reform in the larger American cities. This group helped establish the first federal overview of the economy in the act that created the Bureau of the Budget in 1921. Some of these men and others came to the conclusion that government reform also included economic problems. They organized the Institute of Economics in 1922 as an agency that would explicitly attempt to influence govern- ment economic policy. Its research, the Institute an- nounced, would also \"aid the public in decisions in the light of knowledge.\" 6 The next year the Robert Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government was set up to employ the facilities and findings of the two Insti- tutes in training graduate students for government service. The school was to be a \"workshop\" in economics and government for future policy-makers. In the 1930s and 1940s, Brookings became very conservative and lost much of its earlier influence. By the 1950s it was once again solidly corporate liberal and immersed in the Washington policy-making scene. The Twentieth Century Fund like Brookings was con- cerned with influencing government economic policy. It was established as a disbursing foundation in 1919 by the Boston merchant, Edward A. Filene, and the manufacturer Henry S. Dennison. Like the Brookings groups it aimed at the elimination of economic waste and proclaimed an interest in \"the development of a more rational world.\" 7 It was \"constituted,\" said its founders, \"for the purpose of promoting the investigation and study of and providing instruction as to economic and industrial questions and aiding in improving the relations between employers and employees.\" It was to promote the investigation of \"any 6 Institute of Economics (Pamphlet, Washington, D.C., 1922). 7 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Planning for the Establishment 195 and all matters\" relating to civic and industrial democracy \"including methods of civic and industrial organization and improvement.\" 8 For a number of years it did little original research but gave money to help establish, for example, the credit union and consumers information movements, and to support the liberal Survey magazine and the Interna- tional Management Institute. The Fund also helped orga- nize the Foreign Policy Association. Later on it sponsored research that anticipated or paralleled many New Deal measures. Its members were active in the New Deal and it attracted leading Democrats (and some Republicans) as officers, such as Adolph Berle, Jr., John K. Galbraith, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. After World War II it devoted considerable attention to studies aimed at stimulating American overseas trade and investment. The interests of the Fund have been more diverse than the other groups and its corporate liberalism frequently has been more sophisticated. In 1934 the National Economic and Social Planning Association far outdid the other groups in experimentation and brashness. It was formed by a mixed group of scien- tific-management advocates, mild socialists, and still others who believed that the planning concept might become \"a great unifying principle for communities which have been torn by economic and industrial strife.\" 9 In 1941 the stress on domestic economic and social planning changed to a new emphasis on postwar planning. Businessmen like Charles E. Wilson and William L. Batt (the two top officers of the War Production Board) dominated the newly named National Planning Association and many of the unreconstructed planners were dropped.

Members of the group, with some CED aid, played a vital part in the enactment of the Employment Act of 1946. The Act created the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The Council's first Chair- man was a former Brookings vice-president. Under Eisen- hower the Council was chaired by the research director of the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 1942 the Committee for Economic Development was created by Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones to guarantee postwar planning by businessmen before \"others are pre- pared with plans that may or may not embrace the busi- ness point of view.\" 10 Jones recruited members from the New Deal's Business Advisory Council, lent his top aides as organizers, and housed the new group in Commerce Department offices. CED quickly moved out on its own, however, and developed its own plans and finances. Its members agreed, nevertheless, that CED promised \"a new comfort and effectiveness in the relationships of govern- ment and business.\" 11 In CED as with the other groups a union of businessmen, government officials, and professors produced a series of influential policy recommendations. CED gave crucial assistance in helping to obtain congres- sional approval of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which were intended to reestablish a stable postwar world trade. Later CED helped formulate the Marshall Plan legislation, then lent its President, Paul Hoffman, and many of its staff members to run the agencies created by the Economic Cooperation Act.

A closer look at the original premises of the most impar- tial research organization of them all—the National Bureau of Economic Research—will place that impartiality in historical (and in present) context. Midway in the Progressive Era it became clear to most corporate liberals that the reforms they had supported were not sufficient to prevent a resurgence of what one historian has called a new \"age of industrial violence.\" Socialist strength increased in dramatic fashion in this period. Moreover, as Columbia University economist Wesley C. Mitchell told a San Francisco audience in 1915: \"Dissatis- faction with the present social organization pervades all classes.\" The changes desired are diverse, he said, but \"changes of some sort are desired by all.\" Some corporate liberals began to urge the creation of a federal Commission on Industrial Relations to consider the causes of and remedies for social unrest. The Commission was created and issued a report in 1915. Employers, labor, and the general public were represented on the Commission and the result, Wesley Mitchell remarked, was three reports \"which disagree as to the facts of the situation and as to what should be done.\" \"Opinions formed after many months of professed investigation and deliberations remain at the end about what they were at the beginning.\" For Mitchell, the lessons of the Commission's endeavors were that whereas no class \"should leave others to do its social thinking for it,\" it was imperative that some means be found by which each class could \"avoid letting its conclu- sions be influenced by its wishes.\" 16 New reforms were 16 Wesley C.

Commons; businessmen such as Mal- colm C. Rorty from the American Telephone and Tele- graph Company, E. H. Goodwin of the Chamber of Commerce, and Magnus Alexander. All agreed that a new sort of fact-finding organization was needed. They further agreed that the first step should be an investigation of the distribution of national income. This was, Rorty admitted, one of the most \"controversial economic subjects\" but, after all, what part of the national income went to each element of society was a \"purely arithmetical question.\" 17 Mitchell and his friends felt they had discovered a path to reform that would break with older patterns of class struggle. \"Reform by agitation or class struggle is a jerky way of moving forward, uncomfortable and wasteful of energy,\" Mitchell told the American Statistical Association after the war. \"Are we not intelligent enough to devise a steadier and a more certain method of progress?\" He no longer referred to the importance of social classes doing their own thinking. \"Our first and foremost concern,\" he said: is to develop some way of carrying on the infinitely complicated processes of modern industry and inter- change day by day, despite all tedium and fatigue, and yet to keep ourselves interested in our work and con- tented with the division of the product . . .

Men could be \"contented with the division of the product\" if the will to reform was present on the part of those decision-makers. But Mitchell assumed that it was present—that the problem was not to achieve \"goodwill\" so much as it was to gain knowledge of the existing political economy. After the National Bureau of Economic Research was founded (in 1920) and Mitchell was chosen as Research Director, he amplified the approach to be taken by the new organization. Unlike the abstract theorizing of the older laissez-faire economists, Mitchell insisted that the Bureau men would \"find out and . . . measure the fundamental facts about the actual world.\" This approach was also out of tune with \"those radicals among us,\" he said, who were mostly people \"whose whole temper is opposed to the sober study of fundamental facts and to the cautious experimental policy of change which the social sciences suggest.\" The best way to prevent a violent social revolution from developing, Mitchell revealed, \"is to develop the best possibilities of our existing institutions. And the way to do that is to study the working of these institutions without fear or favor.\" 19 Thus a study of those institutions would disclose any mal- functions that could then be corrected through the corpo- 18 Wesley C.

With both reactionaries and radicals excluded from the gathering of facts, and with no effort made to have those facts \"carry conviction\" to the dissenters, the achievement of agreement was rendered that much easier. One indication of the ability of facts to influence reform came with the publication of the Bureau's study on income distribution in 1922. A decade earlier both radicals and liberals had called for a similar study from the Commission on Industrial Relations because they thought that it would reveal inequities that all classes would be compelled to recognize. This was the same logic employed by the Bureau. It felt that right policy would almost automatically follow from right facts. But in 1922 the National City Bank of New York in its Monthly Newsletter responded to the NBER estimate that seventy percent of the national industrial product went for wages and salaries by insisting that: These figures . . . ought to be brought to the atten- tion of everybody, and particularly of those who are disposed to be critical of the existing industrial order. 20 \"NBER Statement of Purpose,\" News Bulletin, NBER, Inc.

The study proved to the satisfaction of the editors of the Newsletter that each class could no longer fix \"its own compensation without regard to the effect on others,\" but must, instead, be concerned with a \"right adjustment of values\" that would secure \"the common interest.\" 22 But to these bankers the National Bureau study proved that a right adjustment of values need not be made at the expense of their class. In 1939 the Columbia University sociologist Robert S. Lynd made a slashing criticism of the prevailing social sciences. It was an effective attack against the detached research approach of the NBER and his own Twentieth Century Fund. It is a devastating charge against the sophis- ticated technician social scientist today. In his book, Knowledge for What? Lynd argued that social scientists were not taking their problems from the \"fundamental cravings of the human personality.\" Instead, they studied the difficulties in trying to make the existing culture work. Many social scientists, he held, could not even act con- structively on the difficulties of the existing order. Their role was \"merely to stand by, describe, and generalize, like a seismologist watching a volcano.\" The existing culture was \"private capitalism,\" Lynd wrote. And it \"does not now operate, and probably cannot be made to operate, to assure the amount of general wel- fare to which the present stage of our technological skills and intelligence entitle us; and other ways of managing our economy need to be explored.\" Moreover, it should be a major concern of the social scientist \"to discover where and how . . . large-scale planning and control need be 22 The National City Bank of New York, Monthly Newsletter (February, 1922), pp. 11, 12."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"204  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN extended throughout the culture so as to facilitate the human ends of living.\" Lynd's sharpest criticisms were directed at the NBER and his friend Wesley Mitchell. Some men, Lynd wrote, excuse themselves by saying that \"science itself does not pronounce practical or aesthetic or moral judgments,\" forgetting that scientists can make such judgments. \"If they fail to do so, in this world in which the gap between sophisticated knowledge and folk-thinking is so wide, they but aggravate the limitations on the utility of science to man.\" Moreover, some research institutions take \"this abstemious scientific position,\" stopping their work \"at the point at which culture is most in need of their help.\" 23 Mitchell was critical of the book, but he insisted that he agreed with Lynd on the aim of the social sciences. Their value lay in \"improving our culture,\" and that meant \"de- veloping a set of institutions better suited to the require- ments of human personalities.\" But, for Mitchell, the \"most effective way of making the social sciences serve that end\" was to concentrate on the acquisition of \"valid and accurate knowledge\" about the existing institutions. \"Why, for example,\" Mitchell asked: do we leave so much of our labor unemployed, our industrial equipment idle, our natural resources un- used, our technological skill unexercised in the United States? Once more, is it not valid and accurate knowledge of economic processes that is lacking? One had to learn about the institutions one wished to improve. 24 23 Robert S. Lynd, Knowledge for What?

My feeling is that the Bureau, by working so completely on describing how things work in our economy, with its own (the economy's) postulates as to what things are important, tends to draw the teeth of new workers who might otherwise be inclined to ask other kinds of questions that are no less realistic and important. 25 Mitchell responded by saying \"we haven't the makings of a controversy\" so long as Lynd meant \"that the workers ought to understand the functioning of the organization they wish to better.\" 26 Mitchell seems deliberately to have misunderstood Lynd's argument. But perhaps the issue could not have been joined given the corporate-liberal consensus that was emerging even then.

There is drama and even tragedy in the cycle of American radicalism that was played out in that decade. Even if we reject an emphasis upon the romantic elements of the period, it would be wrong to assert that the radical experience was meaningless or limited to insignifi- cant numbers, for many intellectuals were influenced by Marxism and the example of the Soviet Union. Radical intellectuals took themselves seriously and lent their enormous energy to building organizations and committees, to raising money, to rethinking political and economic theory, even to revolutionizing art forms.

Many radicals took part in New Deal programs such as the WPA, but they did little to inspire or direct such programs. Must we conclude, then, that all of this activity was fruitless, and that radical- ism is important merely as a curiosity? One such interpre- tation, setting sharp limits to the influence of radicalism, recognizes it only as a low resonance of the period. Some historians admit to hearing thunder on the left, but reply that the revolutionary deluge never occurred: some reputa- tions may have been splattered with Stalinism, but most intellectuals remained under the beneficent shelter of the New Deal. To others who lived through this decade of political involvement, and many who did have become lead- ing critics, writers, and publishers, the radical years worked as a purgative, expelling innocence in favor of experience. James Burnham has written that \"the experience of Com- munism may have been a necessary phase in the moral development of our generation.\" 1 Although Burnham is wrong to call this experience necessary, he is correct to dwell upon its historical significance. The problem, how- ever, is how to assess its meaning. If we shift our historical focus to the right, toward liberalism as I intend to do, we may still catch radicalism in the periphery where it belongs historically. We may also see its effect in a different guise, as it entered the discussion of liberalism during that decade. From this point of view, the Depression years seem neither particularly red nor unique. The search for a comprehensive liberal philosophy has been a recurring one at least since the Progressive Era. Moreover, the commitment of intellectuals to a political cause is not an unusual phenomenon. It must also be ad- mitted that many intellectuals were interested in radicalism 1 James Burnham and Andre Malraux, The Case for De Gaulle (New York: Random House, 1948), p. 63."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"208  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN in the conservative sense of fighting for the values they cherished and which they assumed were part of a mori- bund capitalism. This clearly is the meaning of much Popular Front activity. 2 Nor is the celebrated sense of realism, which so many intellectuals claimed, in any way unique. Writers and artists of the 1930s did not discover poverty or exploitation or hypocrisy, neither were they much more skillful in conveying its meaning than other generations. But the sense of historical change was particu- larly strong. The Depression convinced many that capital- ism was degenerate and that traditional ideas about society were irrelevant if not vicious. Socialism and especially communism seemed very much a part of the future. In the light of this reaction, traditional liberal tenets of individual- ism, of hidden economic hands, of self-regulating eco- nomics, of abstinent governments did not seem to describe even the most obvious attributes of the advanced capitalist society. But radicalism did, and countless variations on Marxist theory or Soviet practice were offered as a way out of crisis. If we view radicalism as outside the center of thought during the 1930s, yet always clamoring for entrance, one of its meanings becomes clearer: as a body of theories that informed liberal thought and that eventually threatened it. In the remainder of this paper, I intend to examine pre- cisely this phenomenon through the career of James Burn- ham, who passed through the radical movement on his way to a new assessment of liberalism. His intellectual path shows much about the experience of intellectuals in the radical movement and helps to explain the intensely nega- tive reaction to collectivism that occurred after World War II. As with many other intellectuals, Burnham drew upon his experience with Marxism to describe capitalism.

When proven wrong by the war, Burnham searched for the vital center that had kept capitalism alive, picking and choosing among Marxist and liberal ideas to prove the strengths of the old system. Most important, he felt that Marxism and the experience of the Soviet Union exposed the virtues of capitalist society. But it was a new sort of capitalism that he felt he was describing, an eco- nomic and political society modeled upon the modern corporation. 3 The influence of James Burnham has been widely ac- knowledged, but it is difficult to measure precisely. Burn- ham's prophetic books were widely discussed in the early 1940s; although almost from the time he stated his thesis of the managerial revolution, Burnham was dismissed and then later ridiculed. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has called him \"a stock figure of our times—he is the man in a permanent apocalypsis.\" But a stock figure is very often an important one, and in Burnham's case we may learn something of the shift of many intellectuals from a left-wing position to the right. For Burnham as for so many other men of the 1930s, their radical experiences of the period emerged as justification for a new conservatism. Part of the background of Burnham's formulation of the managerial-revolution thesis in 1941 was an attempt to redefine liberalism in the years immediately before the first Roosevelt Administration. At the beginning of the 1930s a series of books and articles written primarily by historians, economists, and sociologists sought to reconstruct liberal theory, to set new social goals and proclaim the nonrevolu- tionary path to social change. This was a strange sort of 3 In this paper I use the terms \"corporate society\" and \"corpo- rate capitalism\" to designate a society in which the corporation is the major economic institution—in which other institutions are sometimes patterned after the corporation."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"210  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN discussion for there were few shared definitions, no dis- cernible sides, no certain issues—except a general concern about the fate of American capitalism—no common forum, and ultimately, no resolution, although the argu- ment appears settled in Burnham's pessimistic description of the managerial society. There were, in the early 1930s, certain common attitudes. Traditional liberalism was de- fined as unreal and useless. As Reinhold Niebuhr wrote in 1932 of the old liberalism: Culturally, the Americans are still children of the nineteenth century. All the dogmas and illusions, the convictions and the sentimentalities of the nineteenth century—the faith in progress, the trust in democracy, and the confidence in the beneficence of competitive individualism . . . had acted, he felt, to repress the social imagination and create injustice. 4 Despite the feeling that a historical era had ended with 1929, the tone of the discussion was not negative, but full of expectation, as if the Crash and the Depression had forced America upon a path of change, and it was now up to the intellectuals to illuminate the way. There is not adequate space in this paper to mention even the various attitudes expressed in this discussion. Nevertheless, a few themes are common to the works of Adolph Berle, Gardiner Means, George Soule, Stuart Chase, Rexford Tugwell, and many others, which recur at the end of the decade as part of the managerial thesis. These ideas may all be placed under the broader proposal to collectivize the American economic and political system. In one sense or another, most of the important books and pamphlets in this discussion proposed that the corporation become responsible to the community, that it become a 4 Reinhold Niebuhr, \"Catastrophe or Social Control?\" Harpers, CLXV (June, 1932), p. 114."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"James Burnham: Radical of the 1930s 211 public institution as it seemed to be in other countries. The conclusion that the private entrepreneurial function had declined, that competition as a device of social control was useless, that ownership was divorced from control, and that professional managers had replaced businessmen, made the socialization of industry seem necessary. As Matthew Woll of the National Civic Federation wrote: \"All functional groups must come into ordered relationship with each other, developing legislative methods, contriving checks and balances, . . .\" and aim toward industrial self- government. 5 One meaning of collectivism was that the corporation should become an economic and political unit with all of the attributes of a miniature state. A second meaning of the new liberal collectivism was the importance of state planning for national goals, and 5 Matthew Woll, quoted in Charles Beard, America Faces the Future (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1932), pp. 34-35.

The Depression seemed to cry out for new national controls over the chaotic aspects of the business world. Thus in the early 1930s, the National Civic Federation, the Chamber of Commerce, and the American Federation of Labor all agreed that some sort of planning was probably necessary and in fact imminent. The federal government would under most such schemes become a kind of giant holding com- pany to guide the general policy of industries, the alloca- tion of resources and laboring conditions, and, for some, the distribution of income and the social priorities of the nation. The new collectivism also challenged the system of ethics based upon individual liberty, the keystone of an older liberalism, and called for an ethics defined in social terms, in which men were described by their dependence upon each other rather than their antagonisms. A new economic man was envisioned by these writers, who was not an entrepreneur activated by self-interest, but a man without class allegiances devoted to public interest; an arbitrator and a planner, a manager, a government ad- ministrator, a technocrat. 6 The proponents of this revolutionary liberalism shared the vision of a new America built upon a new economic ethic and the transformation of the corporation into an institution responsive to public direction. The difference between traditional liberals and these proponents of the new collectivism thus seemed fundamental in the early part of the decade. During the 1930s, however, the discussion lost its momentary clarity, and by the end of the decade, the cherished collectivism was for all practical purposes a conservative smear word. The assumption that planning was inevitable and everywhere related—in other words, the 6 It is no accident that the Technocratic Movement of 1932 and 1933 preoccupied so many men who wrote on the need for planning."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"James Burnham: Radical of the 1930s 213 identification of planning with socialism and communism —eventually condemned it by 1941 to share the same disrepute as the Soviet Union. Collectivism and planning by then seemed to many intellectuals to flow inherently toward fascism or Stalinism. With renewed prosperity and a new faith in the American economic system, which the war brought about, many liberals took a less sanguine view of planning. The intellectual Popular Front helped bring the discus- sion of a new liberalism to a temporary close, yet it was the New Deal that made it apparent that social planning in America would in large measure be a variation of older forms of planning. A liberal revolution, which the collec- tivist discussion envisioned, never materialized. After 1934 planning was still widely discussed among liberals, but it was the radicals who preempted the subject by emphasizing Marxism and the revolutionary example of the Soviet Union. Even this, however, proved to be an interlude, for by the late 1930s liberals and ex-radicals for the most part sought to understand America in nonrevolutionary terms. One of the most important places this discussion of the collectivist state reappeared was as the core of James Burnham's thesis of the managerial revolution. Yet Burn- ham's relation to the discussion in the early 1930s was oblique, because the first time he encountered it he missed the significance he would later attach to it. But after his sojourn in the radical movement, indeed partly because of it, he would lend one final, and in his view, ominous note to the whole discussion. Little in James Burnham's early background indicated that he might later become a leading radical intellectual. Born in 1905 in Chicago, the son of a successful English immigrant father who had risen to be vice-president of the Burlington Railroad, Burnham attended Princeton where he served as an editor of the Princeton Tiger and as a contributor to the Nassau Literary Review. In addition to"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"214  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN an early and abiding interest in literature, he studied philosophy and went on to Oxford to receive a B.A. and finally an M.A. in that field. From 1929 and throughout the 1930s, he taught philosophy at New York University, a colleague of Sidney Hook's. Burnham's philosophic train- ing lent vigor and sometimes logic to his views, yet more often philosophy worked against his politics. The compel- ling drive behind the positions he took seems to have been the feeling—very common to the 1930s—of impending catastrophe and change, and at the same time a desire for orthodoxy and stability that his brother Phillip, who be- came an editor of Commonweal magazine, may have discovered in the Catholic Church. In James, however, these drives helped interest him in Marxism. Burnham's radicalization occurred when he and Philip Wheelwright were editing the distinguished critical maga- zine, the Symposium, from 1930 to 1933. During 1932 and 1933 he began to write on politics. For one brief period he was attracted to the Communist Party, although warily, and contributed a review to their publication, the New Masses. By 1934, however, Burnham's dislike for the communists led him to join the radical group led by A. J. Muste. In that same year his column began to appear regularly in Labor Action, the Musteite newspaper. Very soon he was a leading spokesman for Muste's American Worker's Party and in this position he pushed for merger with the American Trotskyists. When the two groups united to form the Workers' Party, Burnham quickly assumed a prominent role, writing pamphlets for the party, resolutions, and articles, even if a few members of the party distrusted him. When the Trotskyists proposed to enter the Socialist Party in 1936, Burnham was a leading proponent of the move. In 1938 he and Max Schachtman edited the New International, the major publication of the American Trotskyists. Beginning in 1937, Burnham took a stand within the Trotskyist movement that would eventually split him from"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"James Burnham: Radical of the 1930s 215 that radical group. As James Cannon related it, this fight was against the centralism of the party, its organization along the Bolshevik pattern, and against the interpretation that the Soviet Union was a state controlled in the ultimate interest of the working class, whatever its shortcomings and aberrations. Almost everyone, Burnham recalled, knew of his political positions by 1937, but did not object to his remaining in the party. 7 When Burnham's disagreements reappeared in 1939, they occurred this time as part of a factional dispute that split the party, with the Burnham and Schachtman group taking along the New Interna- tional. The result was the formation of a new Workers' Party, which Burnham abruptly abandoned a month after its creation. By May, 1940, he had renounced Marxism entirely. This ended Burnham's organizational ties to the left, except insofar as he operated as a kind of political mentor to the Partisan Review. From 1941, when he wrote the Managerial Revolution (New York, John Day), he gradually slipped into a right-wing position and into rela- tive obscurity. After 1952 and his break with the Partisan Review, because he supported McCarthy and they did not, most of his liberal ties were broken too. In 1955 he became one of the editors of the conservative National Review. From the very beginning of Burnham's career, two qualities of mind, stronger in him than in most other intel- lectuals, characterized his writings: he was often blinded by historical personalities and a form of hero worship; and he had a strong sense of fatalism and the permanence of crisis. Although this latter quality in Burnham often super- seded all else, it was characteristic of a good many intellec- tuals during the 1930s who felt or hoped that capitalism was doomed and who hedged against a future of fascism or communism by adopting some elements of socialism. In Burnham's first really political article for the Sym- 7 James P. Cannon, History of American Trotskyism: Report of a Participant (New York: Pioneer Publications, 1944), p. 254."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"216  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN posium in 1932, after justifying his new interest, he con- cluded that the most important feature of current politics was the Depression and that it would remain a constant part of life in America. What gave hope to this forbidding circumstance, he discovered, was the writing of radicals such as Trotsky. In the midst of a review of The History of the Russian Revolution, Burnham proclaimed Trotsky a brilliant guide and a recorder of a great social event that would probably occur in America in some fashion. \"We now realize clearly enough,\" he wrote, \"that with whatever lags, in our country as well as Russia a major transition is taking place.\" 8 In a world of permanent crisis, Burnham saw a permanent revolution ahead. Burnham still hesitated in 1933 about putting his maga- zine at the service of the revolution. Marxism was relevant to everything in society: \"Marxism can never be merely rejected\"; he explained, \"there is so much in Marxism that is true and good, that if we do not accept it we must find a position that will include its true and its good.\" But this did not include, he felt, adoption of the prevailing attitudes toward literature and criticism among radicals expressed by the theory of proletarian literature. 9 Yet in the later part of that year, Burnham and Wheel- wright pushed their magazine to the left by printing the works of young radical critics such as William Phillips, and by a manifesto declaring that change was necessary and that collectivism should be its form. What Burnham had in mind is apparent from his enthusiastic review of Berle's and Means's book on the modern corporation (cited in footnote 5 above). \"No more potentially important book than this in its or any allied field, has been published in this 8 James Burnham, \"The History of the Russian Revolution,\" Symposium, III (July, 1932), p. 380.

The most important contribution these men made was to describe the separa- tion of ownership and control in capitalist enterprises. But what they lacked, he concluded, was an understanding of Marx that would draw out the revolutionary implications of this fact. 10 When Burnham actually joined the radical movement in 1934, his articles for Labor Age and later for the New International, among other things, worked over one old point: that capitalism was dying and that revolution was imminent. If the workers did not take power, then war, fascism, or some other calamity would follow. If the masses could organize themselves, then the next year, or two years, or three years would be decisive. Change was immediate and certain and it pointed toward fascism or communism. It is quite likely, as Burnham suggested, that he never accepted all of Marxism or Trotskyism, despite the fact that many of his articles are indistinguishable from those written by party members who remained orthodox. Yet when he broke with Trotskyism in 1939, he was less capa- ble of shedding certain habits of mind and assumptions that had been strengthened during his more radical period. The works that he wrote after 1940 show a surprising consistency with what had once passed as radicalism; moreover, much of the reading that he did during the 1930s in books he rejected as a radical, reappeared in his new thesis of the managerial revolution. 11 This is not to 10 James Burnham, \"Comment,\" Symposium, IV (July, 1933), pp. 259-276. 11 James Burnham, \"Capitalism, American Style,\" Partisan Re- view, IV (March, 1938), pp. 50-53; see also, James Burnham, \"Science and Style,\" in Leon Trotsky, In Defense of Marxism, Joseph Hansen and William F.

Burnham's belated contribution to this discussion was a devastating one, for he twisted the proposals and predic- tions of Soule, Tugwell, Berle, Means, and others to fit them into his peculiar and sometimes frantic hypothesis. He added to this ideas taken over from European authors who had stressed the importance of bureaucracy and governing elites in modern society. The thesis of the managerial revolution proclaimed the advent of liberal collectivism, but with special significance. From his experi- ence as a Trotskyist, Burnham concluded that this revolu- tion was an ominous, if exhilarating, change. Burnham began the Managerial Revolution (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1942) by defining the character of societies in terms of modes of production, forms of money, market regulation, and classes. In defining capitalism, he identified it with an ideology of natural rights, of automatic progress, and individualism; ideas, in other words, that clearly had little relevance as a description of the American or any other advanced industrial state. Capitalism existed nowhere in its purest form and whatever remnants still lived were about to die out. Thus far, Burnham seemed to be operating on Marxist terrain; but the whole argument went askew on two points. One was that Russia, \"the chief political enigma of the past generation,\" was part of the same, not opposite, movement as nazism, and that fascism and communism, whatever rhetorical disputes they had, were much the same. Second, he argued, the New Deal was not capitalism and therefore it was also on the road toward the managerial society. Capitalism had ended in America, he wrote, because of government intervention in the economy. It was as if the collective revolution had everywhere succeeded and the technocrats would inherit the earth."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"James Burnham: Radical of the 1930s 219 Burnham's managerial class was the same as Berle's and Thurman Arnold's; men, whatever their ideas, who ran society, the scientists, managers of corporations, and bu- reaucrats. His theory was a hodgepodge of Berle and Means, of the Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto (over whom there was some stir in 1936), of Trotsky's theory of the Soviet bureaucracy, with echoes of Arnold, Soule, Arnold Toynbee, and others, plugged into a scheme of class struggle and inevitable change. To say this is to sug- gest that Burnham included in his theory a sampling of several diverse shades of thought from the decade. Yet there is an important consistency and direction to what he said. Most critics did not miss the implications of his insis- tence upon the inevitability of the new society and his poorly disguised admiration for the new managers. Dwight Macdonald and George Orwell, for example, attacked him for classifying communism and fascism as variants of the same movement and refusing to take a stand against either; of worshiping evil because of cowardice. Burnham's con- tention that socialism was impossible and that democracy never really existed infuriated his radical critics. Yet an- other fact about the Managerial Revolution now seems more important, particularly in the light of Burnham's later intellectual development. Ostensibly a book about a worldwide movement of which Nazi Germany and Com- munist Russia were the most fully and clearly developed examples, the book is really a discussion—and a not par- ticularly acute one—of American corporate society and the similarities between liberal theories of planning and cen- tralized government and fascism and communism. Most significant was the identification of the New Deal with collectivism and the comparison of the American economic system with Soviet Communism, which Burnham had always opposed. Here, it seems clear, is the key to his later plunge to the right. Fortunately for the historian, Burnham in a sense"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"220  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN printed his notes for the Managerial Revolution in his next book, The Machiavellians. Here, many of the implications of his first book became clearer. Georges Sorel, Robert Michels, Vilfredo Pareto, his Machiavellians, were so named because they were realists and found struggle to be a fundamental aspect of society. Above all, they knew that elites always governed society. Political freedom when it existed, wrote Burnham, \"is the resultant of unresolved conflicts among various sections of the elite.\" Tyranny came from the aggrandizement of the state. 12 Burnham was at once more explicit and more sweeping in his rejec- tion of modern liberalism, and more cynical about the creation of some sort of democratic equilibrium. Although his philosophic stance was negative, always defined in terms of what he opposed, he had begun to write himself back to a conception of laissez-faire liberalism. The final link in Burnham's development was forged in an article, \"Lenin's Heir,\" written for the Partisan Review in 1945. Here Burnham's peculiar attraction and repulsion for Stalin, whom he called Lenin's direct and legitimate heir, was apparent. Stalin was a great and awesome figure, worthy of comparison to the tsar, and deserving of respect and fear. Russia's emergence from the war as a great power, a shift in the world balance of power little expected by Burnham, redefined his whole approach to world poli- tics. It transfigured his theories, and changed his fear of communism into a nightmare of total war against Russia, which he fought in the imaginary battles and strategies of his next books. 13 12 James Burnham, The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom (New York: John Day, 1943); and James Burnham, \"Is Democracy Possible?\" in Whose Revolution?: A Study of the Future Course of Liberalism in the United States, Irving D.

Under current circumstances, he wrote in the 1940s, freedom of speech for communists created, in effect, a Popular Front. Thus it was perhaps inevitable that he would support McCarthy, and finally, by 1964, write a long tract {Suicide of the West [New York: John Day]) describing liberalism as the \"ideology of Western suicide.\" This last book, which self-consciously reaches back to identify with his earlier works, is a last variation on Burnham's attack on postwar world society. There was little in society that seemed to be positive in the values it expressed, and only by inference may we conclude that Burnham has retreated to a laissez-faire world—with one important twist. He rejected the optimistic premises of such a world and denied a faith in progress. In his long intellectual progression, Burnham had discovered, he felt, a fundamentally new interpretation of modern industrial society. Much as he misunderstood its function, he was right to focus on the corporation as the basic economic institution in capitalist society. Yet his search for ortho- doxy ended when he rejected the new society and returned to an idea he had expressed in his first important political article. Individualism, he wrote, was not a bad thing: The qualities that enable the successful individual to rise are perhaps not the most commendable; but granted that everyone has enough, the ability to get more is perhaps as good a test as any of those who ought to get more. 14 Burnham's significance, aside from the influence he had on other intellectuals during the crucial period of radical decline, from 1939 to 1941, is perhaps as an example.

So are the mistakes, the logical traps he set for himself, and his false predictions. Yet his career illustrates that the movement from left to right that was typical of so many American intellectuals during the 1930s and 1940s —even if Burnham went farther than most—had a kind of logic. His \"experience with communism,\" helps to explain and define his new conservative philosophy. Significant also is the fact that he broke openly with one wing of liberal thought, represented by the Partisan Review, as late as 1952, although it was perhaps they and not he who covered the greatest political ground in the dispute by pull- ing back from unrestrained anticommunism. It is striking that Burnham remained so long at the outskirts of the liberal intelligentsia, a fact that illustrates how far the reaction of many American intellectuals against commu- nism could carry their political opinions. Burnham's radical middle period had a number of last- ing effects on his thought. It reinforced his assumption that the important structural features of society were easily describable, and that societies could be understood best as systems. Marxism became a kind of intellectual well out of which he drew the sour examples to describe the end of Western society and capitalist individualism. It is clear that Marxism for Burnham always meant economic determi- nism, and that the fatalistic quality implicit in such an assumption, its dependence upon catastrophe, reinforced the apocalyptic visions that filled his mind. His acquaint- ance with Marxist theory and his concentration as a Trotskyist upon the distortions of the Soviet experiment, especially as the theory of Marxism and the practice of Russia were understood in the 1930s, cemented the idea that planning, state control, and centralization were all attributes of socialism.

He eventually rejected almost anything that had even"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"James Burnham: Radical of the 1930s 223 a faint smell of socialism about it. Finally, Burnham's Trotskyist experience helped prepare his path to the right. Two tendencies that it consistently exhibited were also at the foreground of his mind. One was Trotsky's radical critique of Stalinism and his emphasis upon the bureau- cratic features of the new society. Casting aside subtleties, for which Burnham often had little concern, there is not a great deal of distance between Trotsky's theory and Burn- ham's, whatever the vast implications were in terms of action. The aggressiveness of the Trotskyists in actively opposing the Russian Communists helped prepare Burn- ham for his own violent attitude toward the Soviets. Finally, Trotskyism's opposition to the New Deal, its re- fusal to compromise with liberalism, its attack upon the Popular Front as such a compromise (an attack written by Burnham), and its realization that liberalism was a defense of capitalism were all ideas that Burnham transposed into a conservative key. Burnham was consistent in opposing modern liberalism, and this stance eventually led to his assertion of an older form of individualism. Burnham's long search for a radical orthodoxy, his lust for catas- trophe led him ultimately to the negative utopianism of the discouraged, and left him a lone seeker for a society that could no longer exist."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"American Foreign Policy and National-Security Management LEONARD P. LIGGIO National-security management is a twentieth-century phe- nomenon. It is a product of three major factors in con- temporary political development: technology, public opinion, and popular revolution. Technology has meant rapidity of communication—the ability to move both in- formation and persons in short periods over great distances around the globe. The factor of public opinion is related to the increased rapidity of communication. Political leaders are required to be quickly responsive to public opinion formed by quick information. The political leaders' re- sponse is control of information, and the control and manipulation of public opinion. Finally, and related to communication and public opinion, is the development in the twentieth century of politics as a successful challenge not merely to the particular men in power, but also to the social status quo. When foreign relations, wars, and peace conferences existed in the context of nonchallenge to the basic social system—mere rivalries between exploiting units whether states or corporate monopolies—there really was no role for national-security management because that role is pro- foundly ideological and requires a challenge against the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"National-Security Management 225 existing ideology to be operative. An ideological challenge did arise in the midst of World War I. It was the result of two interrelated developments: American entry into the war, and the Russian Revolution. Previous to American entry into World War I, the leaders of the Allies and of the Central Powers did not conceive of the conflict in terms of total ideology. There were people on both sides who did so and they were used by the leaderships as an aid in maintaining support for the war effort. But the leaderships were willing and even anxious to negotiate a peace with the opposing govern- ments if their adversaries made the concessions necessary to fulfill their war aims. There was no demand for uncon- ditional victory and the transformation of the political system of the adversary. This was radically changed with the American entry into the war. The prolonged nature of the war in Europe had intensi- fied the reasons for and against the entry of the United States. Since the domestic political situation had required Woodrow Wilson, in the 1916 presidential election, to emphasize his peaceful intentions, the President's introduc- tion of a war effort into American life a few months later required strong actions to reverse public peace attitudes. Thus, the Central Powers were not treated as temporary military adversaries, but were defined as the Ultimate Evil. A major part of the problems, domestic and international, that faced the countries of the world was related to the existence of this Ultimate Evil; the total elimination of the Ultimate Evil would solve these problems. The war effort took on the character of a crusade with all of its ideological implications. Some aspects of the crusade involved self-celebration; American democracy as an abstraction was emphasized without any regard for the elements that historically created it and that would be violated in the name of the abstraction. A vital part of this self-celebration was the objective of re-creating this democ- racy in the abstract in other countries, and especially in the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"226  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN major countries that had been subjected to autocratic regimes—the Central Powers and Czarist Russia. Thus, the February Revolution in Russia was a very significant event in the crusade ideology of the American government. The February Revolution eliminated the major obstacle on the Allied side that made it difficult to characterize the Central Powers as the sole Ultimate Evil for the benefit of public opinion. The February Revolution seemed to justify the view that American democracy in the abstract could be re-created in one of the former autocratic regimes. Of course, for the American opponents of intervention, the February Revolution led to a different conclusion: a new regime in Russia would initiate the negotiations that would cause a peace settlement between the two sides without unconditional victory, American intervention, or immedi- ate social change. Thus, the February Revolution high- lighted a major distinction between the interventionist and noninterventionist positions in American politics—whether or not war was a positive force for social change in the world. The interventionists viewed American society with satis- faction and thought that war made it possible to maintain at home and to extend to other peoples what satisfied them. The isolationists viewed American society with dissatisfac- tion and felt that war would maintain or increase what dissatisfied them. Senator Robert M. La Follette's (R., Wis.) speech in opposition to Wilson's speech calling for a declaration of war in April, 1917, shows the differences very clearly. In contrast to Wilson's \"idealism,\" La Follette recognized that war and militarism would contribute to the decline of American liberalism. War and militarism en- hanced executive leadership, which was incompatible with liberalism. La Follette called on his fellow senators to vote on the basis of conviction and not on the basis of presiden- tial leadership: Quite another doctrine has recently been promulgated by certain newspapers, which unfortunately seems"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"National-Security Management 227 to have found considerable support elsewhere, and that is the doctrine of \"standing back of the President,\" without inquiring whether the President is right or wrong. . . . If it is important for us to speak and vote our convictions in matters of internal policy, though we may unfortunately be in disagreement with the President, it is infinitely more important for us to speak and vote our convictions when the question is one of peace or war, certain to involve the lives and fortunes of many of our people and, it may be, the destiny of all of them and of the civilized world as well. . . . This is the question that neutral nations the world over are asking. Are we seizing upon this war to con- solidate and extend an imperialistic policy? ...

From opposition to entry into the war it was natural for isolationist spokesmen such as La Follette to criticize sharply the American intervention in the Russian Revolution; La Follette was labeled the \"Bol- shevik spokesman in America.\" The Soviet Revolution of October, 1917, was a product of the profound shock to Western society administered by the first modern total war. The Soviet Revolution represented a major challenge to the expansionist democratic ideology that was pursued by the Wilson Administration. The model of re-created American democracy, which the February Revolution was believed to have initiated, was replaced by a model of social revolution that was feared as imminent in all the Western countries. The disappointment for Wilsonian \"idealism\" was monu- mental. Unable to reverse the developments in Russia, the Wilson Administration incorporated the Soviet Revolution into the conceptualization of Ultimate Evil represented by the Central Powers. The Bolsheviks were defined as the conscious and directed agents of the Central Powers' deci- sion-makers. Thus, the original interventions by American forces in Archangel and Siberia were made in the last summer of the war as part of the world strategy of defeat- ing the Central Powers in the form of their local Russian operatives, as conceived by the Wilsonians, the Bolshevik Party. Thus, when World War I ended, there was an easy transferral to the Bolsheviks of the Ultimate Evil con- 1 Arthur A.

The major part of the problems, domestic and inter- national, that troubled countries of the world and that was supposed to disappear with total victory over the Central Powers could be explained in terms of the existence of the Soviet Revolution as their successor. Total elimination of this Ultimate Evil would be the solution to these problems. 2 The Soviet Revolution was a challenge also because it eliminated a major unit in the world production of raw materials and in international loans. Secretary of State Robert Lansing insisted: Russia is among the largest factors in the complicated system of production and distribution by which the world is clothed and fed. It is not to be expected that economic balance can be regained and living costs brought once more to moderate levels while its vast area [is under the revolution]. 3 Thus, the United States government identified its own prosperity with the stability and availability of raw- material production and markets around the globe. Again, the Soviet Revolution was a challenge as a model for revolution by other countries in a similar position in the world economy.

When the feudal and military bureauc- racies of central Europe were on the verge of overthrow by revolutionary movements, the Wilsonians sought to prevent revolutions while replacing the old bureaucracy with a new liberal bureaucratic and mercantile leadership. Thus, the American decision-makers—president, secretary of state, presidential advisers, and military planners—in Paris for the Versailles Conference were able to apply American economic and military power in Europe to facili- tate and support the transfer of cabinet positions to the socialist leaders who acted as \"an ideal foil against revolu- tionary and anarchist excesses\" of social revolutionaries. This role played by liberals and socialists as wardens against social revolution in 1919 is reminiscent of John Kennedy's summarizing of American policy with reference to the Dominican Republic: There are three possibilities in descending order of preference, a decent democratic regime, a continua- tion of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime. We ought to aim at the first, but we really can't renounce the second until we are sure that we can avoid the third. 4 Similarly, the Wilsonians found themselves supporting reactionary and oppressive regimes to prevent the success of social revolutionaries—Kolchak in Siberia, Horthy in Hungary, etc. In Russia during the Civil War and in postwar Central Europe the role of food was crucial and the United States used its relief operations headed by Herbert Hoover to try to establish the governments it 4 Arno J.

American advisers in both World Wars and the Cold War—often the same people, such as Allen and John Foster Dulles (nephews of Secretary of State Lansing), Bernard Baruch, and Herbert Hoover—viewed American postwar economic aims as two- fold: using economic power to prevent the rise or success of revolutionary movements, and improving the long-term economic position of United States government-supported corporate interests around the world. Arno Mayer has noted: Admittedly Hoover had the most precocious, inte- grated, and operational conception of the politics and diplomacy of foreign aid. But he merely articulated and synthesized ideas and programs which were just then crystallized in influential segments of the Ameri- can power elite. 5 Hoover's role as well as that of other Wilsonians in using foreign aid for Administration political and eco- nomic objectives was related to the direct military interven- tions by American and other Allied forces by American critics of the Administration. Senators William Borah of Idaho and Hiram Johnson of California, leading insurgent Republican foreign policy experts, singled out the Wilson Administration's role in Russia for major consideration. Late in 1918 and early in 1919, they initiated a campaign against the American forces' intervention in Archangel and Siberia. Despite the growing debate concerning the peace conference in Paris and the proposal for the League of Nations, Borah and Johnson made the demand for recogni- tion of the Soviet government and the withdrawal of American forces the center of their attention.

Denouncing efforts to \"underwrite the world\" as impossible and undesirable, Borah pre- dicted that what had happened in Russia, Mexico, and China would occur, sooner or later, all over the globe. He regarded emergent nationalism as the irre- sistible force of the twentieth century and despised the idea of placing the United States on the side he thought fated to lose. 7 Critics of national-security management viewed the Ver- sailles Treaty and the League of Nations as the foundation for an inevitable second world war.

Oswald Garrison Villard, the publisher of the Nation, wrote to Senator La Follette: The more I study it, the more I am convinced that it is the most iniquitous peace document ever drawn, that it dishonors America because it violates our solemn na- tional pledge given to the Germans at the time of the Armistice and because it reeks with bad faith, revenge- fulness and inhumanity.

Villard believed that the League would encourage the imperialist powers to refuse to solve international problems by peaceful means because the League would give them the sanctity of legality when other countries sought to termi- nate injustices. For Villard, the League enshrined and prevented the peaceful ending of the whole imperialist system that the national liberation movements in China, India, Egypt, Africa, and Latin America were striving to destroy. 8 Borah felt that the instruments of American national- security management—gunboat diplomacy, Marine pacifi- cations, military coups, and major interventions by Ameri- can forces as in Russia—would find frequent use as well as sanctification under the League.

Borah provided a classic summary of these two arguments in one of his speeches attack- ing the proposal to clamp a lid on the revolutionary ferment in China after 1917. \"Four hundred million people imbued with the spirit of independence and of national integrity are in the end invincible.\" ... He concluded that a rapprochement with the Soviet Union was \"the key to a restored Europe, to a peaceful Eu- rope.\" In addition, he thought that the United States could play a crucial role in creating the circumstances in which there could \"emerge a freer, a more relaxed, a more democratic Russia.\" \". . . So long as you have a hundred and fifty million people outlawed in a sense, it necessarily follows that you cannot have peace.\" ... Of all Americans, the group around Borah most clearly understood the principle and practice of self- determination in foreign affairs. For that reason, as well as other aspects of Borah's criticism, President Wilson singled out Borah as his most important critic —as the man who might turn out to be right. 11 In the postwar period American national-security man- agement was concentrated on Central America and the Caribbean, and on the Far East. Thus, there was conti- nuity of the policies of interventionism in the Administra- tions of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. An important example was Nicaragua. Henry Stimson, who learned the application of American power in Central America when he was Secretary of War from 1911 to 1913, arrived in Nicaragua as special commissioner, the ultimate result of this American intervention being the rise of the Somoza dictatorship. After holding the governor- generalship of the Philippines (where he worked for the rejection of legislation for Philippine independence), Stim- son became Hoover's Secretary of State.

President Hoover feared that Stim- son's attitude toward Japan—the Stimson Doctrine— would invite war with Japan. For Stimson, nonrecognition of territorial changes made outside of treaty obligations was not an alternative to military and economic sanctions as advocated by Hoover. Rather, it was a preliminary to economic and military sanctions, a way of drawing sharp the issue between the United States (along with the League of Nations) and Japan, a means of laying down the ideological grounds for war if, as he expected, war eventually should come. That was the Stimson doctrine—or, perhaps, the Stimson-Roosevelt doctrine. In the months before Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration in March, 1933, Stimson viewed himself as \"Roosevelt's act- ing Secretary of State,\" and Roosevelt adopted Stimson's foreign policy views and made them the basis of New Deal foreign policy, especially in the Far East. 12 Similarly, Stimson's policy toward Cuba, which, like Nicaragua, he defined as moving toward communism led the new Roosevelt Administration to replace a radical administration with Fulgencio Batista, as, in the words of Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles, \"the only indi- vidual in Cuba today who represented authority.\" The 12 Richard N.

The ideological direction of the New Deal policy-makers was summarized by Herbert Feis in 1940: \"Violent social revolution anywhere in the world is disadvantageous to us. We must contribute, if the chance exists, to an orderly social program.\" 13 The failure of the New Deal as an economic system caused the redefinition of the New Deal as a system of national-security management. By 1940 American unem- ployment was as high as in 1932; United States economic policy in the 1930s caused longer unemployment and deeper decline in economic activity than suffered by any other industrialized nation. Thus, the cause of American economic difficulty was externalized, and the economy subsidized by the needs defined by the national-security concept. Public opinion in the United States was presented with a popular ideological formulation of national security by Henry Luce in an American Century editorial in early 1941. A more precise formulation was presented to the annual convention of the Investment Bankers Association in December, 1940, by Virgil Jordan, President of the National Industrial Conference Board. Jordan declared: Before we can understand any of the needs of indus- try for national defense, we must first try to compre- hend what this thing we call our \"defense program\" really means.

The Interna- tional Monetary Fund, the World Bank, foreign aid, and world trade programs were principal instruments for Amer- ican policy-makers. A major American objective through its economic policy was the \"reintegration of the U.S.S.R. into the capitalist world economy on a basis which econo- mists have dubbed as neocolonialism.\" 15 At the end of the war in Europe, Secretary of State James Byrnes devoted himself to this objective. As de- scribed by Byrnes with regard to the postwar treaties with Germany's eastern European partners: Perhaps most important of all the treaties will make possible the entry of the ex-enemy states (Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria) into the United Nations and their participation in the benefits and responsibilities of such specialized agencies as the International Bank, the Monetary Fund, the Food and Agricultural Organi- zation. Obviously, for the Soviet Union this economic penetration by the United States or U.S.-dominated international agencies meant eventual political control in Central and Eastern Europe. 16 The role of UNRRA is an example. In 1945 the political power of food in preventing or overthrowing social revolu- tion in 1919 was recalled by American policy-makers. The United States attempted to have Americans appointed the heads of UNRRA in most European countries.

We could turn the tide of Communism in all these countries. Hoover stamped out Communism in this way in central Europe.\" What Stimson, McCloy, Hoover, etc., did not recognize was that the premises of European communism in 1945 just as of European socialism in 1919 condemned it to passivity, to cooperation and integration into the program of Allied imperialism. 17 But Ambassador to Russia Averell Harriman and Navy Secretary James Forrestal were reminding each other that a conflict with the Soviet Union was inevitable. George Kennan, counselor of the embassy in Russia, in 1945 recognized the basic conservatism of Soviet diplomacy, but in May, 1945, raised the specter of European left insur- gencies: \"Moscow would have no reason to contemplate a further military advance in Europe. . . . the danger for the West is not Russian invasion—it is the Communist parties in the Western countries themselves, plus the unreal hopes and fears the Western people had been taught to entertain.\" However, it was the communist parties of the West that, under the influence of the Soviet Union, enter- tained the \"unreal hopes and fears\" and acted as conserva- tive forces disarming the armed resistance forces in France, Italy, and Greece, and creating the conditions for co- optation. 18 Forced to choose between obedience and revolutionary success, the popular, national communist parties in Yugo- slavia and China disobeyed Soviet policy and thereby gained success.

This abdication was possible only because the Communists in the [Front] dictated it over a movement they could barely control. Greece was the most tragic example of the conservative role adopted by the postwar European communist parties: The simple matter is that whenever leaders of the Old Order incorporated the Left into a modernized, re- formed capitalism, the Left willingly assumed the role assigned to it. Where the occupation forces repressed it and brought the naked power of reaction to bear, the Left reluctantly fought, and lost, and this was the true lesson of Greece. However, as in Vietnam where the Vietminh were able to defeat the French who were then replaced by the Ameri- cans, the Greek guerrillas caused the British in early 1947 to announce that they were immediately disengaging from the Greek conflict and that the United States should take its place there. 19 At that time the United States was in the process of developing its major foreign aid program, which eventually became the Marshall Plan. Dean Acheson, Undersecretary of State, said that the United States was prosperous be- cause of its large-scale export trade. However, it was ex- porting twice as much as it was importing, which meant that foreign countries, especially in Europe, would not have the dollars to purchase United States exports. The results could lead to crises in the European economies with serious political consequences, and a recession in America. 19 Kolko, op. cit., pp. 172-193, 428-456; William Hardy McNeill, America, Britain, & Russia, Their Co-operation and Conflict, 1941-1946 (New York: Johnson Reprints, 1970), pp. 735-737."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"242  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN But the withdrawal of the British from Greece would have meant a guerrilla victory before the operation of the Marshall Plan could take effect.

Yet, this action was part of a more general policy toward the Soviet Union centering upon increased militarization of relations by the United States. Secretary of State Byrnes's Stuttgart speech of September 6, 1946, delivered before General Lucius Clay's American Occupation forces, indicated United States intentions to use Germany as a principal military position on the borders of the Soviet Union. 21 In the model created in the Greek crisis no consideration was given to the possibility that the guerrillas had person- ally determined to engage in a struggle against the govern- ment's oppression rather than submit.

In the Greek model, the Greek regime's request for United States aid was drafted in Washington and sent to Athens for submission through Greek diplomatic officials. The United States assistant secretary of state explained that the request had been drafted with a view to the mentality of Congress. ... It would also serve to protect the U.S. Government against internal and external charges that it was taking the initiative of intervening in a foreign state or that it had been persuaded by the British to take over a bad legacy from them. 22 The President's speech to Congress proclaiming the Truman Doctrine was weighed for every effect on Congress and public opinion by presidential adviser Clark Clifford and Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson. Nevertheless, there was opposition to the Truman Doctrine. As noted by Joseph Jones in his celebration of the preparation of the Truman Doctrine entitled The Fifteen Weeks: Most of the outright opposition came from the extreme Left and the extreme Right of the political spectrum: from a certain school of \"liberals\" who had long been strongly critical of the administration's stiffening policy toward the Soviet Union, and from the \"iso- lationists\" who had been consistent opponents of all foreign policy measures that projected the United States actively in World affairs. . . . The opposition of the Left emphasized that American aid to the ex- isting Greek and Turkish governments would not pro- mote freedom but would protect anti-democratic and reactionary regimes; and that the proposed action by- passed the United Nations and endangered its future.

On March 28, 1947, he declared: I believe that the White House program is a reaffirma- tion of the nineteenth-century belief in power politics. It is a refinement of the policy first adopted after the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 designed to encircle Russia and establish a \"Cordon Sanitaire\" around the Soviet Union. It is a program which points to a new policy of interventionism in Europe as a corollary to our Monroe Doctrine in South America. Let there be no mistake about the far-reaching implications of this plan. Once we have taken the historic step of sending financial aid, military experts and loans to Greece and Turkey, we shall be irrevocably committed to a course of action from which it will be impossible to with- draw. More and larger demands will follow. Greater needs will arise throughout the many areas of friction in the world. 25 Bender was among the few congressional defenders of Henry Wallace when the latter was widely attacked for his proposals, made in England and France, that Europe oppose the Truman Doctrine's division of the world into two camps and instead act as a balance between them. Wallace's speeches in Europe led to a bipartisan demand for the revocation of his passport; and Bender lashed out at the open season on Wallace. He replied to Churchill's attack on Wallace for speaking abroad by noting that if Churchill could seek to inflame the Cold War by speeches in America (Fulton, Mo., address of March 5, 1946), Wallace could seek to prevent that war by speeches in Europe. On June 6, 1947, Bender presented an overall criti- cism of the bipartisan foreign policy in a speech against Representative Karl Mundt's (R., S.D.) attempt to give a cover of legality to the Voice of America program that the State Department had been operating.

But we have learned to look be- hind the titles or labels of measures prepared by the Truman administration. The Greek-Turkey-aid bill was presented to this Congress as a humanitarian measure, designed to re- lieve hunger and suffering. The Truman administration attempted to conceal and disguise its true character, which was admitted only after the measure was sub- jected to searching examination on the floor of the House. Then it was admitted that all of the so-called aid to Turkey was to be military aid, and most of the aid to Greece was to be military aid. The humanitarian purpose turned out to be hypocrisy. No, we must look behind the high-sounding title in the present bill about the interchange of knowledge and seek out the true character of this measure.

The Truman administration is using all its propaganda resources in an attempt to soften up the American people to accept this idea. Yes; the Truman administration is busy in its at- tempt to sell the idea of military control to the people of America. And hand in hand with the propaganda campaign go secret meetings for industrial mobiliza- tion. This is the kind of thing which is taking place be- hind barred doors in the Pentagon Building, about which the people of the United States learn only by accident. This is a part of the emerging Truman pro- gram. It is against this background that the Voice of Amer- ica program must be considered. This vast foreign propaganda machine prepared by the administration is a part of this program. It is a part just as Mr. Tru- man's friendship with the dictator Peron of South America is a part. It is a part just as Mr. Truman's eagerness for universal military training in the United States is a part.

Kennan's reports for Forrestal became the basis for Kennan's famous \"X\" article on containment of commu- nism that appeared in 1947 in Foreign Affairs. These reports from his post at the National War College, where he had been assigned by Forrestal, provided the ideological content for the aggressive policy of containment that was represented by the Truman Doctrine. This was supposed to prevent the success of left movements in Europe. Describ- ing the aggressive attitude of the Truman Doctrine, Ken- nan has indicated in his Memoirs how lack of precision in the \"X\" article contributed to the universalization of the concept of containment.

In the spring of 1947 the State Department believed that the American economy would be undermined by an impending European economic collapse. This situation would result in political changes that were unacceptable to American planners. Preparations for a speech by Acheson outlining the future Marshall Plan were begun in early April. Acheson pre- sented it as a major address to the Delta Council in Cleve- land, Mississippi, on May 8.

What do these facts of international life mean for the United States and for United States foreign policy? ... the United States is going to have to undertake further emergency financing of foreign purchases if foreign countries are to continue to buy in 1948 and 1949 the commodities which they need to sustain life and at the same time rebuild their economies. . . .

It is one of the principal aims of our foreign policy today to use our economic and financial resources to widen these margins. It is necessary if we are to preserve our own freedoms and our own democratic institutions. It is necessary for our national security. 29 The national-security bureaucracy of the United States developed the view that the threat of social revolution abroad was a problem of modern management techniques —the management of economic aid to countries and eco- nomic incentives to individuals to maintain American dominance. The national security of the United States has been defined to demand that every country develop, eco- nomically and politically, under its aegis. The stable exis- tence of the regimes in each of the countries is the central interest for the United States. If that stability cannot be guaranteed by the management of economic resources, such as trade and foreign aid, then it must be guaranteed by the management of violence. Thus, Acheson was prophetic in centering attention on the Truman Doctrine as a defining element in America's future decision-making. The American military role in the Greek civil war became the model for American interventions in Korea, Iran, Guatemala, Indochina, the Middle East, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and ultimately in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

One of the most important consequences of the American involvement in Greece in the 1940s was the development of new bureaucracies specializing in military assistance, police administration, and eco- nomic aid, committed to an analysis of revolution and a set of responses for dealing with it that would be applied to many different conflicts in the next twenty years. 30 Major critical comment concerning the international difficulties of the United States by the late 1960s stressed the assumption by the United States government of the role of world policeman. This role was sketched already by President Roosevelt during World War II as a special posi- tion for the Big Four, which was to be formalized by their rights as permanent members of the United Nations' Secu- rity Council. When the potential success of this situation did not materialize, unilateral American military power came to represent the final arbiter in world politics. How- ever, the use of United States military power as an ultimate policy was the capstone of a much deeper and more sophisticated program of violence-management: the orga- nization of the existing police work in many countries of the world. In the immediate postwar period United States missions to Greece reorganized the police forces at the same time as a United States mission was reorganizing the Iranian police (the head of this mission to Iran, a former superintendent of New Jersey State Police, in 1953 aided Middle East CIA chief, Kermit Roosevelt, to overthrow Iranian Premier Mossadegh).

The CIA through the Michigan State University Advisory Group organized and developed Diem's police forces. When the police function contributed to the devel- opment of the opposition, as in Vietnam, the substitution of United States military forces as policemen was the natural extension of the process of the management of violence. 31 The Korean War was the police action that clearly raised major issues concerning the policies of the national- security bureaucracy. The natural defender and spokesman of those policies was McGeorge Bundy. Bundy's father had been Assistant Secretary of State and War Department adviser under Henry Stimson, and Bundy had coauthored Stimson's memoirs. Then, he edited the papers of Secretary of State Dean Acheson (the father-in-law of his brother, William Bundy) while the Korean War was in progress. Bundy defended the unlimited power of the executive to undertake political and military action around the globe. He criticized those who desired to limit foreign crises by eliminating areas of friction through negotiations, or who opposed United States military interventions. These ap- proaches, according to Bundy, failed to assert America's global leadership against communism and substituted a defective attitude of doubt, mistrust, and fear regarding America's national purpose in the world. 32 In two articles in the Reporter, in 1951, \"'Appease- ment,' 'Provocation,' and Policy\" and \"The Private World of Robert Taft,\" McGeorge Bundy sketched his defense of the national-security bureaucracy.

For Bundy there is no such thing as too much force or too much domination by military factors; but his insistence upon permanent American intervention into the internal affairs of other countries naturally made him fear the American military's tendency to use air power to minimize the loss of life among American forces, a loss acceptable to the national-security manager if not to the American people. 33 Bundy's concept of the national-security manager manipulating diplomatic and military elements in a long- term series of limited wars and limited proto-war police activities in the underdeveloped countries is basically an elitist approach that excludes a positive role for public opinion, and, a fortiori, for public debate, including con- gressional debate. The public is not committed to the rigid national purpose whose ideology dominates the national- security bureaucracy. Thus, a positive role for public opin- ion, and for public debate, would introduce irreconcilable contradictions into political management. Instead, by ex- cluding a positive role for public opinion, the public will simply react to existing crises that are presented to them by the national-security managers. Bundy's major criticism was leveled at those whom he labeled \"appeasers\"—mainly isolationists such as Senator Robert Taft (R., Ohio) who was dubbed by Bundy the \"Reluctant Dragon\" who would not wage the permanent crusade against communism. Taft was viewed as the most 33 Bundy, \"The Private World of Robert Taft,\" The Reporter (December 11, 1951), pp. 37-38."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"254  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN perceptive and thoroughgoing critic of the policies of the Truman Administration, which became the foundations for American foreign policy for the quarter century that fol- lowed. Taft attacked Truman's dispatch of American troops outside of the United States without the direct approval of Congress. Taft and other critics \"condemned U.S. participation in Korea as unconstitutional and pro- vided that the only funds available for overseas troops shipment should be funds necessary to facilitate the extri- cation of U.S. forces now in Korea.\" It was in opposition to the Truman Administration's desire to prevent open debate on foreign policy that Taft launched the Great Debate of 1951 with Secretary of State Acheson. The Great Debate surrounded the introduction of a resolution forbidding the President to send troops abroad without congressional approval. Taft noted the tendency of na- tional-security managers to insinuate the United States into other countries' affairs, followed by a conflict in which the President would demand unquestioning support in Congress: After that, if anyone dared to suggest criticism or even a thorough debate, he was at once branded as an isolationist and a saboteur of unity and the bipartisan foreign policy. 34 Taft's final foreign policy statement before his death directed the same criticism he had leveled against Acheson toward Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Taft and Dulles had been opponents when Dulles was Acheson's special foreign policy adviser. Taft's speech of May 26, 1953, was particularly concerned with Dulles' Southeast Asia policy because the United States was increasing to seventy percent the amount it contributed to the support of France's puppet regime against the guerrillas led by Ho Chi 34 New Republic (January 15, 1951), p. 7; Congressional Record, 82nd Cong., 1st sess., p. 55."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"National-Security Management 255 Minh. Dulles' policy, Taft feared, along with the eventual defeat of the French, would lead to their replacement by the United States, including the potential intervention of American military forces against the guerrillas. Taft de- clared : I have never felt that we should send American sol- diers to the Continent of Asia, which, of course, in- cluded China proper and Indo-China, simply because we are so outnumbered in fighting a land war on the Continent of Asia that it would bring about complete exhaustion even if we were able to win. ... So to- day, as since 1947 in Europe and 1950 in Asia, we are really trying to arm the world against Communist Russia, or at least furnish all the assistance which can be of use to them in opposing Communism. Is this policy of uniting the free world against Communism in time of peace going to be a practical long-term policy? I have always been a skeptic on the subject of the mili- tary practicability of NATO. ... I have always felt that we should not attempt to fight Russia on the ground on the Continent of Europe any more than we should attempt to fight China on the Continent of Asia. 35 Although the experience of the United States' interven- tion in Vietnam confirms Senator Taft's analyses of execu- tive dominance of foreign policy and the role of the national-security bureaucracy, McGeorge Bundy did not reevaluate his criticism of Taft and his support of Ache- son's national-security management. Bundy's years as na- tional-security manager during the Kennedy-Johnson Ad- ministrations confirmed him in every concept he expressed when defending Acheson's policy-making against Taft. In Foreign Affairs (January, 1967) Bundy indicated that his major consideration was that the Vietnam experience must increase the confidence of the American people in the 35 Vital Speeches, 19 (June 15, 1953), pp. 530-531."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"2$6  NEW HISTORY OF LEVIATHAN ability of the national-security management to maintain United States world dominance (Bundy noted that four- fifths of all foreign investments are controlled by the United States). Any negotiations concerning Vietnam must be conducted, according to Bundy, so that there is no appearance of defeat for the United States, for then the American public would radically question the whole struc- ture and ideology of the United States' world dominance. He advocated manipulation of Vietnam negotiations to retain public confidence in the whole national-security process. Thus, an original part of the purpose of the Viet- nam intervention was quickly achieved: client governments of the United States were assured that the United States government would gamble on continuing them in power against popular revolutions even at the cost of American lives. Bundy viewed, as a vital consequence of the Vietnam War, the need for continued commitment by the American public to \"extensive policies\" and \"extensive actions\" which require the national-security bureaucracy to apply military and diplomatic means, bombing and negotiations, and every other option, alternative, and instrument in the national-security arsenal. Bundy considered the most con- spicuous expansion during the Kennedy-Johnson Adminis- trations to be the management of violence—and that this has \"been right, and that it is right to persevere.\" 36 Thus, the national-security management views its role ultimately as a police role: neither a political role, which would seek the support of the people involved, nor a mili- tary role, which would not pretend to be aimed at the benefit of the people subjected to it, but the police role of application of violence against the will of the people but for their benefit.

Walt W. Rostow was the principal spokes- man for this \"new theory,\" and to cope with national- security management in the 1970s Rostow now suggests that United States troops will continue to be used in the underdeveloped world for the management of crises. Rostow said: we shall see in other parts of the world as well the positioning of forward equipment, with more of our forces maintained in the center but capable of quick movement. That will have to evolve with the big air- craft. . . . you must have overseas bases which are secure which contain some heavy equipment. We are now talking about things that are for the seventies. These plans for future management of violence are pro- grammed; the crucial ingredient remains the confidence of the American people in the ideology of the national- security process. 37 Richard Nixon recognized this when he assumed the presidency in 1969; central to his Administration has been the struggle for the confidence of the public through avoidance of public debate, including congressional debate, while pursuing national-security management, especially in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Future management of violence depends upon the continued support for the mili- tary base of national security.

They believe that America will be able to deal with the possibility of peace only when we are unable to cope with the threat of war. Those who think that way have grown weary of the weight of free world leadership that fell upon us in the wake of World War II. They argue that the United States is as much respon- sible for the tensions in the world as the adversaries we face. They assert that the United States is blocking the road to peace by maintaining its military strength at home and its defenses abroad. And if we would only reduce our forces, they contend, tensions would disappear, and the chances for peace would brighten. America's powerful military presence on the world scene, they believe, makes peace abroad improbable and peace at home impossible. Now we should never underestimate the appeal of this isolationist school of thought. Their slogans are simplistic and powerful: Charity begins at home. Let's first solve our problems at home and then we can deal with the problems of the world. This simple formula touches a responsive chord with many an overburdened taxpayer.
