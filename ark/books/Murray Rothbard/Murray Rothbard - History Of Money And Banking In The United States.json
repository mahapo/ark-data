But evenaside from the explicitly Austrian theoretical framework under-girding the historical narrative, this book does not “look” or“feel” like standard economic histories as they have been writ-ten during the past quarter of a century, under the influence ofthe positivistic “new economic history” or “cliometrics.” Thefocus of this latter approach to economic history, which todaycompletely dominates this field of inquiry, is on the applicationof high-powered statistical methods to the analysis of quantita-tive economic data. What profoundly distinguishes Rothbard’sapproach from the prevailing approach is his insistence upontreating economic quantities and processes as unique and com-plex historical events. Thus, he employs the laws of economictheory in conjunction with other relevant disciplines to traceeach event back to the nonquantifiable values and goals of theparticular actors involved. In Rothbard’s view, economic lawscan be relied upon in interpreting these nonrepeatable histori-cal events because the validity of these laws—or, better yet,their truth—can be established with certainty by praxeology, ascience based on the universal experience of human action thatis logically anterior to the experience of particular historical7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"episodes.1It is in this sense that it can be said that economictheory is an a prioriscience. In sharp contrast, the new economic historians view historyas a laboratory in which economic theory is continually beingtested. The economic quantities observed at different dates inhistory are treated like the homogeneous empirical data gener-ated by a controlled and repeatable experiment. As such, theyare used as evidence in statistical tests of hypotheses regardingthe causes of a class of events, such as inflations or financialcrises, that are observed to recur in history. The hypothesis thatbest fits the evidence is then tentatively accepted as providing avalid causal explanation of the class of events in question, pend-ing future testing against new evidence that is constantlyemerging out of the unfolding historical process.One of the pioneers of the new economic history, Douglass C.North, a Nobel Prize-winner in economics, describes its methodin the following terms:It is impossible to analyze and explain the issues dealt within economic history without developing initial hypothesesand testing them in the light of available evidence. The ini-tial hypotheses come from the body of economic theory thathas evolved in the past 200 years and is being continuallytested and refined by empirical inquiry. The statistics pro-vide the precise measurement and empirical evidence bywhich to test the theory. The limits of inquiry are dictated by theexistence of appropriate theory and evidence. . . . The evidence is,ideally, statistical data that precisely define and measure theissues to be tested.28A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II1For good discussions of praxeology, see Ludwig von Mises, HumanAction: A Treatise on Economics, Scholar’s Edition (Auburn, Ala.: MisesInstitute, 1998), pp. 1–71; Murray N.

First, as North emphasizes, this approachnarrowly limits the kinds of questions that can be investigatedin economic history. Those issues which do not readily lendthemselves to formulation in quantitative terms or for whichstatistical data are not available tend to be downplayed or neg-lected altogether. Thus the new economic historians are morelikely to seek answers to questions like: What was the net con-tribution of the railroad to the growth of real GNP in the UnitedStates? Or, what has been the effect of the creation of the FederalReserve System on the stability of the price level and real out-put? They are much less likely to address in a meaningful waythe questions of what motivatedthe huge government landgrants for railroad rights-of-way or the passage of the FederalReserve Act. In general, the question of “Cui bono?”—or “Who bene-fits?”—from changes in policies and institutions receives verylittle attention in the cliometric literature, because the evidencethat one needs to answer it, bearing as it does on humanmotives, is essentially subjective and devoid of a measurable oreven quantifiable dimension. This is not to deny that new eco-nomic historians have sought to explain the ex post aggregatedistribution of income that results from a given change in theinstitutional framework or in the policy regime. What theirmethod precludes them from doing is identifying the ex antepurposes as well as ideas about the most efficacious means ofaccomplishing these purposes that motivated the specific indi-viduals who lobbied for or initiated the change that effected anew income distribution. However, avoiding such questionsleaves the quantitative data themselves ultimately unexplained.The reason is that the institutions that contribute to their for-mation, such as the railroads or the Fed, are always the complexresultants of the purposive actions of particular individuals orgroups of individuals aimed at achieving definite goals by theuse of specific means. So the new economic history is not his-tory in the traditional sense of an attempt to “understand” theIntroduction9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"human motives underlying the emergence of economic institu-tions and processes.The second and even more profound flaw in the new eco-nomic history is the relationship it posits between theory and his-tory. For North, history is the source of the “empirical evi-dence”—that is, “ideally, statistical data”—against which theeconomic theory is tested. This means that the claim to validityof a particular theorem is always tentative and defeasible, rest-ing as it does on its nonfalsification in previous empirical tests.However, this also means that economic history must be contin-ually revised, because the very theory which is employed toidentify the causal relations between historical events canalways be falsified by new evidence coming to light in the ongo-ing historical process. In other words, what the new economichistorians characterize as “the intimate relationship betweenmeasurement and theory” is in reality the vicious circle thatensnares all attempts to invoke positivist precepts in the inter-pretation of history.3For if the theory used to interpret pastevents can always be invalidated by future events, then it isunclear whether theory is the explanansor the explanandin his-torical research.Rothbard’s approach to monetary history does not focus onmeasurement but on motives. Once the goals of the actors andtheir ideas about the appropriate means for achieving thesegoals have been established, economic theory, along with othersciences, is brought to bear to trace out the effects of theseactions in producing the complex events and processes of historywhich are only partially and imperfectly captured in statisticaldata. This is not to say that Rothbard ignores the quantitativeaspects of historical monetary processes. Indeed, his bookabounds with money, price, and output data; but these data are10A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II3Robert William Fogel, “The New Economic History: Its Findingsand Methods,” in The Reinterpretation of American History, Robert WilliamFogel and Stanley L.

For Rothbard, a particularprice datum is, no less than the Spanish-American War, a histor-ical event,and its causes must be traced back to the subjectiveaims governing human plans and choices. In flatly rejecting the positivist approach to economic history,Rothbard adopts the method of historical research first formu-lated by Ludwig von Mises. In developing this method, Misescorrectly delineated, for the first time, the relationship betweentheory and history. It is Rothbard’s great contribution in this vol-ume—and his earlier America’s Great Depression—to be the firstto consistently apply it to economic history.4It is worth summa-rizing this method here for several reasons. First, Mises’s writ-ings on the proper method of historical research have inexplica-bly been almost completely ignored up to the present, even bythose who have adopted Mises’s praxeological approach in eco-nomics.5Second, familiarity with Mises’s method of historicalresearch illuminates the source and character of the remarkabledistinctiveness of Rothbard’s historical writings. In particular, itserves to correct the common but mistaken impression thatRothbard’s historical writings, especially on the origin anddevelopment of the U.S. monetary system, are grounded innothing more substantial than an idiosyncratic “conspiracy the-ory of history.” Third, it gives us an opportunity to elucidate theimportant elaboration of Mises’s method that Rothbard con-tributed and which he deploys to great effect in explicating thetopic of this volume. And finally, we find in Mises’s method aIntroduction114Murray N. Rothbard, America’s Great Depression, 5th ed. (Auburn,Ala.: Mises Institute, 2000).5As Rothbard has written of Theory and History, the book in whichMises gives this method its most detailed exposition, this work “hasmade remarkably little impact, and has rarely been cited even by theyoung economists of the recent Austrian revival. It remains by far themost neglected masterwork of Mises.” Murray N. Rothbard, Preface toLudwig von Mises’s Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social andEconomic Evolution, 2nd ed.

To begin with, Mises grounds his discussion of historicalmethod on the insight that ideas are the primordial stuff of his-tory. In his words: History is the record of human action. Human action is theconscious effort of man to substitute more satisfactoryconditions for less satisfactory ones. Ideas determine whatare to be considered more and less satisfactory conditionsand what means are to be resorted to to alter them. Thusideas are the main theme of the study of history.6This is not to say that all history should be intellectual history,but that ideas are the ultimate cause of all social phenomena,including and especially economic phenomena. As Mises puts it, The genuine history of mankind is the history of ideas. It isideas that distinguish man from all other beings. Ideasengender social institutions, political changes, technologi-cal methods of production, and all that is called economicconditions.7Thus, for Mises, history establishes the fact that men, inspired by definite ideas,made definite judgments of value, chose definite ends, andresorted to definite means in order to attain the ends chosen,and it deals furthermore with the outcome of their actions,the state of affairs the action brought about.8Ideas—specifically those embodying the purposes andvalues that direct action—are not only the point of contact12A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II6Ibid., pp. 224–25.7Ibid., p. 187.8Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science: AnEssay on Method, 2nd ed.

Both economics and history deal with individualchoices of ends and the judgments of value underlying them.On the one hand, economic theory as a branch of praxeologytakes these value judgments and choices as given data andrestricts itself to logically inferring from them the laws govern-ing the valuing and pricing of the means or “goods.” As such,economics does not inquire into the individual’s motivations invaluing and choosing specific ends. Hence, contrary to the pos-itivist method, the truth of economic theorems is substantiatedapart from and without reference to specific and concrete his-torical experience. They are the conclusions of logically validdeduction from universal experience of the fact that humansadopt means that they believe to be appropriate in attainingends that they judge to be valuable.9The subject of history, on the other hand, “is action and thejudgments of value directing action toward definite ends.”10This means that for history, in contrast to economics, actionsand value judgments are not ultimate “givens” but, in Mises’swords, “are the starting point of a specific mode of reflection, ofthe specific understanding of the historical sciences of humanaction.” Equipped with the method of “specific understand-ing,” the historian, “when faced with a value judgment and theresulting action . . . may try to understand how they originatedin the mind of the actor.”11Introduction139It is true that in deriving theorems that apply to the specific condi-tions characterizing human action in our world, a few additional facts ofa lesser degree of generality are inserted into the deductive chain of rea-soning. These include the facts that there exists a variety of naturalresources, that human labor is differentiated, and that leisure is valued asa consumer’s good. See Mises, Human Action; Rothbard, The Logic ofAction I; and Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method.10Mises, Theory and History, p. 298.11Ibid., p. 310."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The difference between the methods of economics and his-tory may be illustrated with the following example. The econo-mist qua economist “explains” the Vietnam War-era inflationthat began in the mid-1960s and culminated in the inflationaryrecession of 1973–1975 by identifying those actions of the Fedwith respect to the money supply that initiated and sustainedit.12The historian, including the economic historian, however,must identify and then assign weights to all those factors thatmotivatedthe various members of the Fed’s Board of Governors(or of the Federal Open Market Committee) to adopt this courseof action. These factors include: ideology; partisan politics;pressure exerted by the incumbent administration; the grasp ofeconomic theory; the expressed and perceived desires of theFed’s constituencies, including commercial bankers and bonddealers; the informal power and influence of the Fed chairmanwithin the structure of governance; and so on. In short, the economic historian must supply the motivesunderlying the actions that are relevant to explaining the his-torical event. And for this task, his only suitable tool is under-standing. Thus, as Mises puts it, The scope of understanding is the mental grasp of phenom-ena which cannot be totally elucidated by logic, mathemat-ics, praxeology, and the natural sciences to the extent thatthey cannot be cleared up by all these sciences.13To say that a full explanation of any historical event, includ-ing an economic one, requires that the method of specificunderstanding be applied is not to diminish the importance ofpure economic theory in the study of history. Indeed, as Misespoints out, economics 14A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II12Some economists would date this inflation from 1965 to 1979, butthe precise dates do not matter for our present purposes. See, for exam-ple, Thomas Mayer, Monetary Policy and the Great Inflation in the UnitedStates: The Federal Reserve and the Failure of Macroeconomic Policy(Northampton, Mass.: Edward Elgar, 1999).13Mises, Human Action, p. 50."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"provides in its field a consummate interpretation of pastevents recorded and a consummate anticipation of theeffects to be expected from future actions of a definite kind.Neither this interpretation nor this anticipation tells any-thing about the actual content and quality of the actual indi-viduals’ judgments of value. Both presuppose that the indi-viduals are valuing and acting, but their theorems areindependent of and unaffected by the particular characteris-tics of this valuing and acting.14For Mises, then, if the historian is to present a completeexplanation of a particular event, he must bring to bear not onlyhis “specific understanding” of the motives of action but thetheorems of economic science as well as those of the other“aprioristic,” or nonexperimental, sciences, such as logic andmathematics. He must also utilize knowledge yielded by thenatural sciences, including the applied sciences of technologyand therapeutics.15Familiarity with the teachings of all thesedisciplines is required in order to correctly identify the causalrelevance of a particular action to a historical event, to trace outits specific consequences, and to evaluate its success from thepoint of view of the actor’s goals. For example, without knowledge of the economic theoremthat, ceteris paribus, changes in the supply of money causeinverse changes in its purchasing power, a historian of the priceinflation of the Vietnam War-era probably would ignore the Fedand its motives altogether. Perhaps, he is under the influence ofthe erroneous Galbraithian doctrine of administered prices withits implication of cost-push inflation.16 In this case, he mightconcentrate exclusively and irrelevantly on the motives ofunion leaders in demanding large wage increases and on theobjectives of the “technostructure” of large business firms inIntroduction1514Mises, Theory and History, p. 309.15Ibid., p. 301.16John Kenneth Galbraith, The New Industrial State(New York: NewAmerican Library, 1967), pp. 189–207, 256–70."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"acceding to these demands and deciding what part of the costincrease to pass on to consumers. Thus, according to Mises,If what these disciplines [i.e., the aprioristic and the naturalsciences] teach is insufficient or if the historian chooses anerroneous theory out of several conflicting theories held bythe specialists, his effort is misled and his performance isabortive.17But what exactly is the historical method of specific under-standing, and how can it provide true knowledge of a whollysubjective and unobservable phenomenon like human motiva-tion? First of all, as Mises emphasizes, the specific understandingof past events is not a mental process exclusively resorted to by historians. Itis applied by everybody in daily intercourse with all his fel-lows. It is a technique employed in all interhuman relations.It is practiced by children in the nursery and kindergarten, bybusinessmen in trade, by politicians and statesmen in affairsof state. All are eager to get information about other people’svaluations and plans and to appraise them correctly.18The reason this technique is so ubiquitously employed bypeople in their daily affairs is because all action aims at rear-ranging future conditions so that they are more satisfactoryfrom the actor’s point of view. However, the future situationthat actually emerges always depends partly on the purposesand choices of others besides the actor. In order to achieve hisends, then, the actor must anticipate not only changes affectingthe future state of affairs caused by natural phenomena, butalso the changes that result from the conduct of others who,like him, are contemporaneously planning and acting.1916A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II17Mises, Theory and History, p. 301.18Ibid., p. 265.19As Mises puts it, “Understanding aims at anticipating future condi-tions as far as they depend on human ideas, valuations, and actions.”Mises, Ultimate Foundation, p. 49."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Understanding the values and goals of others is thus aninescapable prerequisite for successful action. Now, the method that provides the individual planningaction with information about the values and goals of otheractors is essentially the same method employed by the historianwho seeks knowledge of the values and goals of actors inbygone epochs. Mises emphasizes the universal application ofthis method by referring to the actor and the historian as “thehistorian of the future” and “the historian of the past,” respec-tively.20Regardless of the purpose for which it is used, therefore,understandingaims at establishing the facts that men attach a definitemeaning to the state of their environment, that they valuethis state and, motivated by these judgments of value, resortto definite means in order to preserve or to attain a definitestate of affairs different from that which would prevail ifthey abstained from any purposeful reaction. Understand-ing deals with judgments of value, with the choice of endsand of the means resorted to for the attainment of theseends, and with the valuation of the outcome of actions per-formed.21Furthermore, whether directed toward planning action orinterpreting history, the exercise of specific understanding isnot an arbitrary or haphazard enterprise peculiar to each indi-vidual historian or actor; it is the product of a discipline thatMises calls “thymology,” which encompasses “knowledge ofhuman valuations and volitions.”22Mises characterizes thisdiscipline as follows:Thymology is on the one hand an offshoot of introspectionand on the other a precipitate of historical experience. It iswhat everybody learns from intercourse with his fellows. ItIntroduction1720Mises, Theory and History, p. 320.21Mises, Ultimate Foundation, p. 48.22Mises, Theory and History, p. 265."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"is what a man knows about the way in which people valuedifferent conditions, about their wishes and desires andtheir plans to realize these wishes and desires. It is theknowledge of the social environment in which a man livesand acts or, with historians, of a foreign milieu about whichhe has learned by studying special sources.23Thus, Mises tells us, thymology can be classified as “a branchof history” since “[i]t derives its knowledge from historicalexperience.”24Consequently, the epistemic product of thymo-logical experience is categorically different from the knowledgederived from experiments in the natural sciences. Experimentalknowledge consists of “scientific facts” whose truth is inde-pendent of time. Thymological knowledge is confined to “his-torical facts,” which are unique and nonrepeatable events.Accordingly, Mises concludes, All that thymology can tell us is that in the past definite menor groups of men were valuing and acting in a definite way.Whether they will in the future value and act in the sameway remains uncertain. All that can be asserted about theirfuture conduct is speculative anticipation of the future basedon specific understanding of the historical branches of thesciences of human action. . . . What thymology achieves isthe elaboration of a catalogue of human traits. It can more-over establish the fact that certain traits appeared in the pastas a rule in connection with certain other traits.25More concretely, all our anticipations about how family mem-bers, friends, acquaintances, and strangers will react in particu-lar situations are based on our accumulated thymological expe-rience. That a spouse will appreciate a specific type of jewelryfor her birthday, that a friend will enthusiastically endorse ourplan to see a Clint Eastwood movie, that a particular studentwill complain about his grade—all these expectations are18A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II23Ibid., p. 266.24Ibid., p. 272.25Ibid., pp. 272, 274."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"based on our direct experience of their past modes of valuingand acting. Even our expectations of how strangers will react indefinite situations or what course political, social, and economicevents will take are based on thymology. For example, ourreservoir of thymological experience provides us with theknowledge that men are jealous of their wives. Thus, it allowsus to “understand” and forecast that if a man makes overtadvances to a married woman in the presence of her husband,he will almost certainly be rebuffed and runs a considerable riskof being punched in the nose. Moreover, we may forecast witha high degree of certitude that both the Republican and theDemocratic nominees will outpoll the Libertarian Party candi-date in a forthcoming presidential election; that the price forcommercial time during the televising of the Major League Soc-cer championship will not exceed the price for commercialsduring the broadcast of the Super Bowl next year; that the aver-age price of a personal computer will be neither $1 million nor$10 in three months; and that the author of this paper will neverbe crowned king of England. All of these forecasts, and literallymillions of others of a similar degree of certainty, are based onthe specific understanding of the values and goals motivatingmillions of nameless actors. As noted, the source of thymological experience is our inter-actions with and observations of other people. It isacquired either directly from observing our fellow men andtransacting business with them or indirectly from readingand from hearsay, as well as out of our special experienceacquired in previous contacts with the individuals or groupsconcerned.26Such mundane experience is accessible to all who havereached the age of reason and forms the bedrock foundationfor forecasting the future conduct of others whose actions willaffect their plans. Furthermore, as Mises points out, the use ofthymological knowledge in everyday affairs is straightforward:Introduction1926Ibid., p. 313."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Thymology tells no more than that man is driven by variousinnate instincts, various passions, and various ideas. Theanticipating individual tries to set aside those factors thatmanifestly do not play any concrete role in the concrete caseunder consideration. Then he chooses among the remainingones.27To aid in this task of narrowing down the goals and desiresthat are likely to motivate the behavior of particular individu-als, we resort to the “thymological concept” of “human charac-ter.”28The concrete content of the “character” we attribute to aspecific individual is based on our direct or indirect knowledgeof his past behavior. In formulating our plans, “We assume thatthis character will not change if no special reasons interfere,and, going a step farther, we even try to foretell how definitechanges in conditions will affect his reactions.”29It is confi-dence in our spouse’s “character,” for example, that permits usto leave for work each morning secure in the knowledge thathe or she will not suddenly disappear with the children andthe family bank account. And our saving and investment plansinvolve an image of Alan Greenspan’s character that is basedon our direct or indirect knowledge of his past actions andutterances. In formulating our intertemporal consumptionplans, we are thus led to completely discount or assign a verylow likelihood to the possibility that he will either deliberatelyorchestrate a 10-percent deflation of the money supply orattempt to peg the short-run interest rate at zero percent in theforeseeable future. Despite reliance on the tool of thymological experience,however, all human understanding of future events remainsuncertain, to some degree, for these events are generally a com-plex resultant of various causal factors operating concurrently.All forecasts of the future, therefore, must involve not only an20A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II27Ibid.28Mises, Ultimate Foundation, p. 50.29Ibid."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"enumeration of the factors that operate in bringing about theanticipated result but also the weighting of the relative influ-ence of each factor on the outcome. Of the two, the more diffi-cult problem is that of apportioning the proper weights amongthe various operative factors. Even if the actor accurately andcompletely identifies all the causal factors involved, the likeli-hood of the forecast event being realized depends on the actorhaving solved the weighting problem. The uncertainty inherentin forecasting, therefore, stems mainly from the intricacy ofassigning the correct weights to different actions and the inten-sity of their effects.30While thymology powerfully, but implicitly, shapes every-one’s understanding of and planning for the future in everyfacet of life, the thymological method is used deliberately andrigorously by the historian who seeks a specific understandingof the motives underlying the value judgments and choices ofthe actors whom he judges to have been central to the specificevent or epoch he is interested in explaining. Like future eventsand situations envisioned in the plans of actors, all historicalevents and the epochs they define are unique and complex out-comes codetermined by numerous human actions and reac-tions. This is the meaning of Mises’s statement,History is a sequence of changes. Every historical situationhas its individuality, its own characteristics that distinguishit from any other situation. The stream of history neverreturns to a previously occupied point. History is not repeti-tious.31It is precisely because history does not repeat itself that thy-mological experience does not yield certain knowledge of thecause of historical events in the same way as experimentation inthe natural sciences. Thus the historian, like the actor, mustresort to specific understanding when enumerating the variousIntroduction2130Mises, Theory and History, pp. 306–08, 313–14.31Ibid., p. 219."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"motives and actions that bear a causal relation to the event inquestion and when assigning each action’s contribution to theoutcome a relative weight. In this task, “Understanding is in therealm of history the equivalent, as it were, of quantitative analy-sis and measurement.”32The historian uses specific understand-ing to try to gauge the causal “relevance” of each factor to theoutcome. But such assessments of relevance do not take the formof objective measurements calculable by statistical techniques;they are expressed in the form of subjective “judgments of rele-vance” based on thymology.33Successful entrepreneurs tend tobe those who consistently formulate a superior understandingof the likelihood of future events based on thymology.The weighting problem that confronts actors and historiansmay be illustrated with the following example. The Fed increasesthe money supply by 5 percent in response to a 20-percentplunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average—or, perhaps now,the Nasdaq—that ignites fears of a recession and a concomitantincrease in the demand for liquidity on the part of householdsand firms. At the same time, OPEC announces a 10-percentincrease in its members’ quotas and the U.S. Congress increasesthe minimum wage by 10 percent.

The economic his-torian, too, exercises understanding when making judgments ofrelevance about the factors responsible for the observed move-ments of the value of money during historical episodes of infla-tion or deflation. Rothbard’s contribution to Mises’s method of historicalresearch involves the creation of a guide that mitigates some ofthe uncertainty associated with formulating judgments of rele-vance about human motives. According to Rothbard, “It is partof the inescapable condition of the historian that he must makeestimates and judgments about human motivation even thoughhe cannot ground his judgments in absolute and apodictic cer-tainty.”34But the task of assigning motives and weighting theirrelevance is rendered more difficult by the fact that, in manycases, historical actors, especially those seeking economic gainthrough the political process, are inclined to deliberatelyobscure the reasons for their conduct. Generally in these situa-tions, Rothbard points out, “the actor himself tries his best tohide his economic motive and to trumpet his more abstract andideological concerns.”35Rothbard contends, however, that such attempts to obfuscateor conceal the pecuniary motive for an action by appeals toIntroduction2334Murray N.

But a problem arises in those cases “whenactions involve longer and more complex causal chains.”37Rothbard points to the Marshall Plan as an example of the lat-ter. In this instance, the widely proclaimed motives of the archi-tects of the plan were to prevent starvation in Western Euro-pean nations and to strengthen their resistance to the allures ofCommunism. Not a word was spoken about the goal that wasalso at the root of the Marshall Plan: promoting and subsidizingU.S. export industries. It was only through painstaking researchthat historians were later able to uncover and assess the rele-vance of the economic motive at work.38Given the propensity of those seeking and dispensing privi-leges and subsidies in the political arena to lie about their truemotives, Rothbard formulates what he describes as “a theoreticalguide which will indicate in advance whether or not a historicalaction will be predominantly for economic, or for ideological,motives.”39Now, it is true that Rothbard derives this guide fromhis overall worldview. The historian’s worldview, however,should not be interpreted as a purely ideological construction oran unconscious reflection of his normative biases.

According to Mises:History is not an intellectual reproduction, but a condensedrepresentation of the past in conceptual terms. The historiandoes not simply let the events speak for themselves.

The novelty and bril-liance of this guide lies in the fact that it is neither a purelyaprioristic law like an economic theorem nor an experimentallyestablished “fact” of the natural sciences. Rather it is a socio-logical generalization grounded on a creative blend of thymo-logical experience and economic theory. At the core of this gen-eralization is the insight that the State throughout history hasbeen essentially an organization of a segment of the populationthat forsakes peaceful economic activity to constitute itself as aruling class. This class makes its living parasitically by estab-lishing a permanent hegemonic or “political” relationshipbetween itself and the productive members of the population.This political relationship permits the rulers to subsist on thetribute or taxes routinely and “legally” expropriated from theincome and wealth of the producing class. The latter class iscomposed of the “subjects” or, in the case of democratic states,the “taxpayers,” who earn their living through the peaceful“economic means” of production and voluntary exchange. Incontrast, constituents of the ruling class may be thought of as“tax-consumers” who earn their living through the coercive26A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"“political means” of taxation and the sale of monopoly privi-leges.42Rothbard argues that economic logic dictates that the kingand his courtiers, or the democratic government and its specialinterest groups, can never constitute more than a small minor-ity of the country’s population—that all States, regardless oftheir formal organization, must effectively involve oligarchicrule.43 The reasons for this are twofold. First, the fundamentallyparasitic nature of the relationship between the rulers and theruled by itself necessitates that the majority of the populationengages in productive activity in order to be able to pay the trib-ute or taxes extracted by the ruling class while still sustainingits own existence. If the ruling class comprised the majority ofthe population, economic collapse and systemic breakdownwould swiftly ensue as the productive class died out. Themajoritarian ruling class itself then would either be forced intoproductive activity or dissolve into internecine warfare aimedat establishing a new and more stable—that is, oligarchic—rela-tionship between rulers and producers. The second reason why the ruling class tends to be an oli-garchy is related to the law of comparative advantage. In aworld where human abilities and skills vary widely, the divi-sion of labor and specialization pervades all sectors of theeconomy as well as society as a whole. Thus, not only is it thecase that a relatively small segment of the populace possessesa comparative advantage in developing new software, sellingIntroduction2742For expositions of the view of the origin and nature of the state as acoercive organization of the political means for acquiring income, seeFranz Oppenheimer, The State(New York: Free Life Editions, [1914] 1975);Albert J.

Moreover, the law of comparative advantagegoverns the structure of relationships within as well as betweenorganizations, accounting for the hierarchical structure that wealmost invariably observe within individual organizations.Whether we are considering a business enterprise, a chess club,or a criminal gang, an energetic and visionary elite invariablycomes to the fore, either formally or informally, to lead anddirect the relatively inert majority. This “Iron Law of Oli-garchy,” as this internal manifestation of the law of comparativeadvantage has been dubbed, operates to transform an initiallymajoritarian democratic government, or even a decentralizedrepublican government, into a tightly centralized State con-trolled by a ruling elite.44The foregoing analysis leads Rothbard to conclude that theexercise of political power is inherently an oligarchic enterprise.The small minority that excels in wielding political power willtend to coalesce and devote an extraordinary amount of mentalenergy and other resources to establishing and maintaining apermanent and lucrative hegemonic bond over the productivemajority. Accordingly, since politics is the main source of theirincome, the policies and actions of the members of this oli-garchic ruling class will be driven primarily by economicmotives. The exploited producing class, in contrast, will notexpend nearly as many resources on politics, and their actionsin the political arena will not be motivated by economic gain tothe same degree, precisely because they are absorbed in earningtheir livelihoods in their own chosen areas of specialization onthe market. As Rothbard explains:28A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II44One of the first expositions of the operation of this law, within thecontext of social democratic political parties can be found in RobertMichels, Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendenciesof Modern Democracy (New York: Dover Publications, [1915] 1959)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the ruling class, being small and largely specialized, ismotivated to think about its economic interests twenty-four hours a day.

They are con-stantly at work trying to preserve and expand their privi-leges.45The ruling class, however, confronts one serious and ongo-ing problem: how to persuade the productive majority, whosetribute or taxes it consumes, that its laws, regulations, and poli-cies are beneficial; that is, that they coincide with “the publicinterest” or are designed to promote “the common good” or tooptimize “social welfare.” Given its minority status, failure tosolve this problem exposes the political class to serious conse-quences. Even passive resistance by a substantial part of theproducers, in the form of mass tax resistance, renders theincome of the political class and, therefore, its continued exis-tence extremely precarious. More ominously, attempts to sup-press such resistance may cause it to spread and intensify andeventually boil over into an active revolution whose likelyresult is the forcible ousting of the minority exploiting classfrom its position of political power. Here is where the intellec-tuals come in. It is their task to convince the public to activelysubmit to State rule because it is beneficial to do so, or at leastto passively endure the State’s depredations because the alter-native is anarchy and chaos. In return for fabricating an ideo-logical cover for its exploitation of the masses of subjects ortaxpayers, these “court intellectuals” are rewarded with thepower, wealth, and prestige of a junior partnership in the rul-ing elite.

In today’s world, these motives are expressedin the rhetoric of “social democracy” in Europe and that ofmodern—or welfare-state—liberalism in the United States.47In the past, ruling oligarchies have appealed to the ideologiesof royal absolutism, Marxism, Progressivism, Fascism,National Socialism, New Deal liberalism, and so on to camou-flage their economic goals in advocating a continual aggran-dizement of State power. In devising his theoretical guide,then, Rothbard seeks to provide historians with a means ofpiercing the shroud of ideological rhetoric and illuminatingthe true motives underlying the policies and actions of rulingelites throughout history.

The task of thehistorian, then, is to penetrate to the essence of the transac-tion, to strip the ideological garb from the Emperor Stateand to reveal the economic motive at the heart of theissue.48In characterizing the modern democratic State as essentiallya means for coercively redistributing income from producers topoliticians, bureaucrats, and special interest groups, Rothbardopens himself up to the charge of espousing a conspiracy theoryof economic history. But it is his emphasis on the almost univer-sal propensity of those who employ the political means for eco-nomic gain to conceal their true motives with ideological cantthat makes him especially susceptible to this charge. Indeed, theChicago School’s theory of economic regulation and the publicchoice theory of the Virginia School also portray politicians,bureaucrats, and industries regulated by the State as interestedalmost exclusively in maximizing their utility in the narrowsense, which in many, if not most, cases involves a maximizationof pecuniary gain.49However, economists of both schools areinured against the charge of conspiracy theory because in theirapplied work they generally eschew a systematic, thymologicalIntroduction3148Rothbard, “Economic Determinism,” p. 5.49For examples, see, respectively, George J.

Instead, their posi-tivist methodology inclines them to mechanically impute to realactors in concrete historical circumstances a narrowly conceivedutility maximization. James Buchanan, one of the founders of public choice theory,writes, for instance, that economists pursuing this paradigm tend to bring with them models of man that have been found use-ful within economic theory, models that have been used todevelop empirically testable and empirically corroboratedhypotheses. These models embody the presumption thatpersons seek to maximize their own utilities, and their ownnarrowly defined economic well-being is an important com-ponent of these utilities.50George Stigler, who pioneered the theory of economic regu-lation, argues, “There is, in fact, only one theory of humanbehavior, and that is the utility-maximizing theory.” But forStigler, unlike Rothbard or Mises, the exact arguments of theutility function of flesh-and-blood actors are not ascertained bythe historical method of specific understanding but by theempirical method. Thus, Stigler argues: The first purpose of the empirical studies [of regulatory policy]is to identify the purpose of the legislation! The announcedgoals of a policy are sometimes unrelated or perverselyrelated to its actual effects and the truly intended effects shouldbe deduced from the actual effects. This is not a tautologydesigned to gloss over a hard problem, but instead a hypoth-esis on the nature of political life. . . . If an economic policyhas been adopted by many communities, or if it is persist-ently pursued by a society over a long span of time, it isfruitful to assume that the real effects were known anddesired.5132A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II50Buchanan, “Politics without Romance,” p. 13.51Stigler, “Theory of Economic Regulation,” p. 140."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"By thus discounting the effect of erroneous ideas about theappropriate means for achieving preferred goals on the choicesmade by historical actors, Stigler the positivist seeks to freehimself from the task of delving into the murky and unmeasur-able phenomenon of motives. Without doubt, if the historicaloutcome of a policy or action is always what was aimed at byan individual or organization—because, according to Stigler,“errors are not what men live by or on”—then there is no needto ever address the question of motive. For Stigler, then, there isno reason for the historian to try to subjectively understand themotive for an action because the actor’s goal is objectivelyrevealed by the observed result. Now, Stigler would probablyagree that it is absurd to assume that Hitler was aiming atdefeat in World War II by doggedly pursuing his disastrous pol-icy on the Eastern front over an extended period of time. Butthis assumption only appears absurd to us in light of the thy-mological insight into Hitler’s mind achieved by examining therecords of his actions, policies, utterances, and writings, andthose of his associates. This insight leads us to an understanding,which cannot be reasonably doubted by anyone of normal intel-ligence, that Hitler was fervently seeking victory in the war. Rothbard insists that the same method of specific under-standing that allows the historian to grasp Hitler’s objectives indirecting the German military campaign against the SovietUnion also is appropriate when attempting to discern themotives of those who lobby for a tariff or for the creation of acentral bank. Accordingly, the guide that Rothbard originates todirect the economic historian first to a search for evidence of anunspoken economic motive in such instances is only a guide. Assuch, it can never rule out in advance the possibility that an ide-ological or altruistic goal may serve as the dominant motivationin a specific case. If his research turns up no evidence of a hid-den economic motive, then the historian must explore furtherfor ideological or other noneconomic motives that may be oper-ating. Thus, as Rothbard points out, his approach to economichistory, whether it is labeled a “conspiracy theory of history” ornot, “is really only praxeology applied to human history, inIntroduction33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"assuming that men have motives on which they act.”52Thisapproach also respects what Mises has called “historical indi-viduality” by assuming that “[t]he characteristics of individualmen, their ideas and judgments of value as well as the actionsguided by those ideas and judgments, cannot be traced back tosomething of which they would be the derivatives.”53In sharpcontrast, the positivist methods of Stigler and Buchananattempt to force participants in historical events into the Pro-crustean bed of homo economicus, who ever and unerringly seeksfor his own economic gain. We can more fully appreciate the significance of Rothbard’smethodological innovation by briefly contrasting his explana-tion of the origins of the Federal Reserve System with the expla-nation given by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz in theirinfluential work, A Monetary History of the United States,1867–1960.54Since its publication in 1963, this book has servedas the standard reference work for all subsequent research inU.S. monetary history. While Friedman and Schwartz cannotexactly be classified as new economic historians, their book iswritten from a strongly positivist viewpoint and its methods arecongenial to those pursuing research in this paradigm.55Forexample, in the preface to the book, Friedman and Schwartzwrite that their aim is “to provide a prologue and a backgroundfor a statistical analysis of the secular and cyclical behavior ofmoney in the United States, and to exclude any material not rel-evant to that purpose.” In particular it is not their ambition towrite “a full-scale economic and political history that would be34A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II52Murray N.

Indeed, theopening sentence of the book reads, “This book is about thestock of money in the United States.”57Now Friedman and Schwartz certainly do not, and wouldnot, deny that movements in the money supply are caused bythe purposeful actions of motivated human beings. Rather,the positivist methodology they espouse constrains them tonarrowly focus their historical narrative on the observableoutcomes of these actions and never to formally addresstheir motivation. For, according to the positivist philosophyof science, it is only observable and quantifiable phenomenathat can be assigned the status of “cause” in a scientific investi-gation, while human motives are intensive qualities lacking aquantifiable dimension. So, if one is to write a monetary historythat is scientific in the strictly positivist sense, the title must beconstrued quite literally as the chronicling of quantitative vari-ations in a selected monetary aggregate and the measurableeffects of these variations on other quantifiable economicvariables, such as the price level and real output. However, even Friedman and Schwartz’s Monetary Historymust occasionally emerge from the bog of statistical analysis andaddress human motivation in order to explain the economicIntroduction3556Friedman and Schwartz, A Monetary History, p. xxii.57Ibid., p. 3. As doctrinaire positivists, Friedman and Schwartz consis-tently refer to the “stock” or “quantity” of money rather than to the “sup-ply” of money, presumably because the former is the observable marketoutcome of the interaction of the unobservable money supply and moneydemand curves. However, it is likely that Friedman and Schwartz con-ceive the money stock as a good empirical proxy for the money supply,because they view the latter as perfectly inelastic with respect to the pricelevel.

Due to theawkward fit of motives into the positivist framework, however,Friedman and Schwartz’s forays into human history tend to becursory and unilluminating, when not downright misleading.For example, their two chapters dealing with the crucial periodfrom 1879 to 1914 in U.S. monetary history comprise one hun-dred pages, only 11 of which are devoted to discussing the polit-ical and social factors that culminated in the establishment of theFederal Reserve System.58In these pages, Friedman andSchwartz suggest that the “money ‘issue’” that consumedAmerican politics in the last three decades of the nineteenthcentury was precipitated by “the crime of 1873” and was almostexclusively driven by the silver interests in league with theinflationist and agrarian Populist Party. This movement, more-over, was partly expressive of the 1890s, a decade which,according to C. Vann Woodward as quoted by the authors, “hadrather more than its share of zaniness and crankiness, and thatthese qualities were manifested in the higher and middling aswell as lower orders of American society.”59In thus trivializingthe “money issue,” the authors completely ignore the calculatedand covert drive by the Wall Street banks led by the Morgansand Rockefellers for a cartelization of the entire banking indus-try, with themselves and their political allies at the helm. Thismovement, which began in earnest in the 1890s, was also in parta reaction to the proposals of the silverite and agrarian infla-tionists and was aimed at reserving to the banks the gains forth-coming from monetary inflation. Friedman and Schwartz thus portray the drive toward a cen-tral bank as completely unconnected with the money issue andas only getting under way in reaction to the panic of 1907 andthe problem with the “inelasticity of the currency” that was36A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II58Friedman and Schwartz,A Monetary History, pp. 89–188. 59Ibid., p. 115, n. 40."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"then commonly construed as its cause. The result is that theycharacterize the Federal Reserve System as the product of astraightforward, disinterested, bipartisan effort to provide apractical solution to a purely technical problem afflicting themonetary system.60Nowhere in their discussion of the genesisof the Federal Reserve System do Friedman and Schwartz raisethe all-important question of precisely which groups benefittedfrom this “solution.” Nor do they probe deeply into the motivesof the proponents of the Federal Reserve Act. After a brief andsuperficial account of the events leading up to the enactment ofthe law, they hasten to return to the main task of their “mone-tary history” which, as Friedman expresses it in another work,is “to add to our tested knowledge.”61For Friedman and Schwartz, then, the central aim of eco-nomic history is the testing of hypotheses suggested by empiri-cal regularities observed in the historical data. Accordingly,Friedman and Schwartz describe their approach to economichistory as “conjectural history—the tale of ‘what might havebeen.’ ”62In their view, the primary task of the economic histo-rian is to identify the observable set of circumstances thataccounts for the emergence of the historical events under inves-tigation by formulating and testing theoretical conjecturesabout the course of events that would have developed in theabsence of these circumstances. This “counterfactual method,”as the new economic historians refer to it, explains the histori-cal events in question and, at the same time, adds to the “testedknowledge” of theoretical relationships to be utilized in futureinvestigations in economic history.63Introduction3760Ibid., p. 171.61Milton Friedman, “The Quantity Theory of Money—A Restatement,”in Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money (Chicago: University of ChicagoPress, [1956] 1973), p. 18. 62Ibid., p. 168.63For more on the nature and use of the counterfactual method, seeRobert William Fogel, “The New Economic History: Its Findings andMethods,” in The Reinterpretation of American History,Robert William"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Friedman and Schwartz exemplify this method in their treat-ment of the panic of 1907.64During this episode, banks swiftlyrestricted cash payments to their depositors within weeks afterthe financial crisis struck, and there ensued no large-scale fail-ure or even temporary closing of banks. Friedman andSchwartz formulate from this experience the theoretical conjec-ture that, when a financial crisis strikes, early restrictions oncurrency payments work to prevent a large-scale disruption ofthe banking system. They then test this conjecture by referenceto the events of 1929–1933. In this case, although the financialcrisis began with the crash of the stock market in October 1929,cash payments to bank depositors were not restricted untilMarch 1933. From 1930 to 1933, there occurred a massive waveof bank failures. The theoretical conjecture, or “counterfactualstatement,” that a timely restriction of cash payments wouldhave checked the spread of a financial crisis, is therefore empir-ically validated by this episode because, in the absence of atimely bank restriction, a wave of bank failures did, in fact,occur after 1929.Granted, Friedman and Schwartz do recognize that thesetheoretical conjectures cannot be truly tested because “[t]here isno way to repeat the experiment precisely and so to test theseconjectures in detail.” Nonetheless, they maintain that “all ana-lytical history, history that seeks to interpret and not simplyrecord the past, is of this character, which is why history mustbe continuously rewritten in the light of new evidence as itunfolds.”65In other words, history must be revised repeatedlybecause the very theory that is employed to interpret it is itselfsubject to constant revision on the basis of “new evidence” that38A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIFogel and Stanley L.

In rejecting the historical method of specific under-standing, Friedman and Schwartz are led not by reason, but bya narrow positivist prepossession with using history as a labo-ratory, albeit imperfect, for formulating and testing theories thatwill allow prediction and control of future phenomena. Of theunderlying intent of such a positivist approach to history, Miseswrote, “This discipline will abstract from historical experiencelaws which could render to social ‘engineering’ the same serv-ices the laws of physics render to technological engineering.”67Needless to say, for Rothbard, history can never serve evenas an imperfect laboratory for testing theory, because of hisagreement with Mises that “the subject matter of history . . . isvalue judgments and their projection into the reality ofchange.”68In seeking to explain the origins of the FederalReserve System, therefore, Rothbard focuses on the question ofIntroduction3966Ibid., p. xix.67Mises, Theory and History,p. 285.68Mises, Human Action, p. 48."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"who would reasonably have expected to benefit from and val-ued such a radical change in the monetary system. Here iswhere Rothbard’s scientific worldview comes into play. As anAustrian monetary theorist, he recognizes that the limits onbank credit inflation confronted by a fractional reserve bankingsystem based on gold are likely to be much less confining undera central bank than under the quasi-decentralized NationalBanking System put in place immediately prior to the passageof the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The praxeological reasoningof Austrian monetary theory also leads to the conclusion thatthose who stand to reap the lion’s share of the economic bene-fits from a bank credit inflation tend to be the lenders and firstrecipients of the newly created notes and deposits, namely,commercial and investment bankers and their clients. Guidedby the implications of this praxeological knowledge and of histhymological rule about the motives of those who lobby forState laws and regulations, Rothbard is led to scrutinize thegoals and actions of the large Wall Street commercial andinvestment bankers, their industrial clientele, and their relativesand allies in the political arena. Rothbard’s analysis of the concrete evidence demonstratesthat, beginning in the late 1890s, a full decade before the panicof 1907, this Wall Street banking axis and allied special interestsbegan to surreptitiously orchestrate and finance an intellectualand political movement agitating for the imposition of a centralbank. This movement included academic economists who cov-ered up its narrow and venal economic interests by appealing tothe allegedly universal economic benefits that would be forth-coming from a central bank operating as a benevolent and dis-interested provider of an “elastic” currency and “lender of lastresort.” In fact, what the banking and business elites dearlydesired was a central bank that would provide an elastic supplyof paper reserves to supplement existing gold reserves. Banks’access to additional reserves would facilitate a larger and morelucrative bank credit inflation and, more important, wouldprovide the means to ward off or mitigate the recurrent finan-cial crises that had brought past inflationary booms to an40A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"abrupt and disastrous end in bank failures and industrialdepression.

One of the important benefits of Rothbard’sunique approach is that it naturally leads to an account of thedevelopment of the U.S. monetary system in terms of a com-pelling narrative linking human motives and plans that often-times are hidden and devious to outcomes that sometimes aretragic.

In that way,gold became, in effect, legal tender as well. Unfortunately, byestablishing bimetallism, Britain became perpetually subject tothe evil known as Gresham’s Law, which states that when gov-ernment compulsorily overvalues one money and undervaluesanother, the undervalued money will leave the country or dis-appear into hoards, while the overvalued money will floodinto circulation. Hence, the popular catchphrase of Gresham’sLaw: “Bad money drives out good.” But the important point tonote is that the triumph of “bad” money is the result, notof per-verse free-market competition, but of government using the47[Previously published in a volume edited by U.S. Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas) and Lewis Lehrman, The Case for Gold: A Minority Report of the U.S.Gold Commission(Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute, 1983), pp. 17–118.—Ed.]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"compulsory legal tender power to privilege one money aboveanother. In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britain, the govern-ment maintained a mint ratio between gold and silver that con-sistently overvalued gold and undervalued silver in relation toworld market prices, with the resultant disappearance and out-flow of full-bodied silver coins, and an influx of gold, and themaintenance in circulation of only eroded and “lightweight”silver coins. Attempts to rectify the fixed bimetallic ratios werealways too little and too late.1In the sparsely settled American colonies, money, as it alwaysdoes, arose in the market as a useful and scarce commodity andbegan to serve as a general medium of exchange. Thus, beaverfur and wampum were used as money in the north forexchanges with the Indians, and fish and corn also served asmoney. Rice was used as money in South Carolina, and the mostwidespread use of commodity money was tobacco, whichserved as money in Virginia. The pound-of-tobacco was the cur-rency unit in Virginia, with warehouse receipts in tobacco circu-lating as money backed 100 percent by the tobacco in the ware-house. While commodity money continued to serve satisfactorily inrural areas, as the colonial economy grew, Americans importedgold and silver coins to serve as monetary media in urban cen-ters and in foreign trade. English coins were imported, but sotoo were gold and silver coins from other European countries.Among the gold coins circulating in America were the French48A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II1In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Britishmaintained fixed mint ratios of from 15.1-to-1 of silver grains in relation togold grains, to about 15.5-to-1. Yet the world market ratio of weight, set byforces of supply and demand, was about 14.9-to-1. Thus, silver was con-sistently undervalued and gold overvalued.

It is important to realize that gold and silver are internationalcommodities, and that therefore, when not prohibited by gov-ernment decree, foreign coins are perfectly capable of serving asstandard moneys. There is no need to have a national govern-ment monopolize the coinage, and indeed foreign gold and sil-ver coins constituted much of the coinage in the United Statesuntil Congress outlawed the use of foreign coins in 1857. Thus,if a free market is allowed to prevail in a country, foreign coinswill circulate naturally. Silver and gold coins will tend to bevalued in proportion to their respective weights, and the ratiobetweensilver and gold will be set by the market in accordancewith their relative supply and demand. SHILLING ANDDOLLARMANIPULATIONSBy far the leading specie coin circulating in America was theSpanish silver dollar, defined as consisting of 387 grains of puresilver. The dollar was divided into “pieces of eight,” or “bits,”each consisting of one-eighth of a dollar. Spanish dollars cameinto the North American colonies through lucrative trade with theWest Indies. The Spanish silver dollar had been the world’s out-standing coin since the early sixteenth century, and was spreadpartially by dint of the vast silver output of the Spanish coloniesin Latin America. More important, however, was that the Spanishdollar, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, was relativelythe most stable and least debased coin in the Western world.2A History of Money and Banking in the United States49Before the Twentieth Century2The name “dollar” came from “thaler,” the name given to the coin ofsimilar weight, the “Joachimsthaler” or “schlicken thaler,” issued sincethe early sixteenth century by the Count of Schlick in Joachimsthal inBohemia. The Joachimsthalers weighed 451 Troy grains of silver. So suc-cessful were these coins that similar thalers were minted in Burgundy,Holland, and France; most successful of these was the Maria Theresathaler, which began being minted in 1751 and formed a considerable por-tion of American currency after that date. The Spanish “pieces of eight”adopted the name “dollar” after 1690."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Since the Spanish silver dollar consisted of 387 grains, andthe English shilling consisted of 86 grains of silver, this meantthe natural, free-market ratio between the two coins would be4 shillings 6 pence per dollar.3Constant complaints, both by contemporaries and by somelater historians, arose about an alleged “scarcity of money,”especially of specie, in the colonies, allegedly justifying numer-ous colonial paper money schemes to remedy that “shortage.”In reality, there was no such shortage. It is true that England, in amercantilist attempt to hoard specie, kept minting for its own pre-rogative and outlawed minting in the colonies; it also prohibitedthe export of English coin to America. But this did not keepspecie from America, for, as we have seen, Americans were ableto import Spanish and other foreign coin, including English,from other countries. Indeed, as we shall see, it was preciselypaper money issues that led, by Gresham’s Law, to outflowsand disappearance of specie from the colonies. In their own mercantilism, the colonial governments earlytried to hoard their own specie by debasing their shilling stan-dards in terms of Spanish dollars. Whereas their naturalweights dictated a ratio of 4 shillings 6 pence to the dollar,Massachusetts, in 1642, began a general colonial process ofcompetitive debasement of shillings. Massachusetts arbitrarilydecreed that the Spanish dollar be valued at 5 shillings; the ideawas to attract an inflow of Spanish silver dollars into thatcolony, and to subsidize Massachusetts exports by making theirprices cheaper in terms of dollars. Soon, Connecticut and othercolonies followed suit, each persistently upping the ante ofdebasement. The result was to increase the supply of nominalunits of account by debasing the shilling, inflating domesticprices and thereby bringing the temporary export stimulus to arapid end. Finally, the English government brought a halt to thisfutile and inflationary practice in 1707. 50A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II3Since 20 shillings make £1, this meant that the natural ratio betweenthe two currencies was £l = $4.44."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"But the colonial governments had already found another,and far more inflationary, arrow for their bow: the invention ofgovernment fiat paper money.GOVERNMENTPAPERMONEYApart from medieval China, which invented both paperand printing centuries before the West, the world had neverseen government paper money until the colonial governmentof Massachusetts emitted a fiat paper issue in 1690.4, 5Massa-chusetts was accustomed to launching plunder expeditionsagainst the prosperous French colony in Quebec. Generally, theexpeditions were successful, and would return to Boston, selltheir booty, and pay off the soldiers with the proceeds. Thistime, however, the expedition was beaten back decisively, andthe soldiers returned to Boston in ill humor, grumbling for theirpay. Discontented soldiers are ripe for mutiny, so the Massa-chusetts government looked around in concern for a way to paythe soldiers. It tried to borrow £3,000–£4,000 from Boston mer-chants, but evidently the Massachusetts credit rating was notthe best. Finally, Massachusetts decided in December 1690 toprint £7,000 in paper notes and to use them to pay the soldiers.Suspecting that the public would not accept irredeemablepaper, the government made a twofold pledge when it issuedthe notes: that it would redeem them in gold or silver out of taxA History of Money and Banking in the United States51Before the Twentieth Century4Government paper redeemable in gold began in the early ninth cen-tury, and after three centuries the government escalated to irredeemablefiat paper, with the usual consequences of boom-bust cycles, and run-away inflation. See Gordon Tullock, “Paper Money—A Cycle in Cathay,”Economic History Review9, no. 3 (1957): 393–96.5The only exception was a curious form of paper money issued fiveyears earlier in Quebec, to become known as “card money.” The govern-ing intendantof Quebec, Monsieur Mueles, divided some playing cardsinto quarters, marked them with various monetary denominations, andthen issued them to pay for wages and materials sold to the government.He ordered the public to accept the cards as legal tender, and this partic-ular issue was later redeemed in specie sent from France."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"revenue in a few years and that absolutely no further papernotes would be issued. Characteristically, however, both partsof the pledge went quickly by the board: The issue limit disap-peared in a few months, and all the bills continued unredeemedfor nearly 40 years. As early as February 1691, the Massachu-setts government proclaimed that its issue had fallen “far short”and so it proceeded to emit £40,000 of new money to repay allof its outstanding debt, again pledging falsely that this wouldbe the absolute final note issue. But Massachusetts found that the increase in the supply ofmoney, coupled with a fall in the demand for paper because ofgrowing lack of confidence in future redemption in specie, led toa rapid depreciation of new money in relation to specie. Indeed,within a year after the initial issue, the new paper pound haddepreciated on the market by 40 percent against specie. By 1692, the government moved against this market evalua-tion by use of force, making the paper money compulsory legaltender for all debts at par with specie, and by granting a pre-mium of 5 percent on all payment of debts to the governmentmade in paper notes. This legal tender law had the unwantedeffect of Gresham’s Law: the disappearance of specie circulationin the colony. In addition, the expanding paper issues drove upprices and hampered exports from the colony. In this way, thespecie “shortage” became the creature rather than the cause ofthe fiat paper issues. Thus, in 1690, before the orgy of paperissues began, £200,000 of silver money was available in NewEngland; by 1711, however, with Connecticut and Rhode Islandhaving followed suit in paper money issue, £240,000 of papermoney had been issued in New England but the silver hadalmost disappeared from circulation. Ironically, then, Massachusetts’s and her sister colonies’issue of paper money created rather than solved any “scarcityof money.” The new paper drove out the old specie. The con-sequent driving up of prices and depreciation of paperscarcely relieved any alleged money scarcity among the pub-lic. But since the paper was issued to finance government52A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"expenditures and pay public debts, the government, not thepublic, benefited from the fiat issue. After Massachusetts had emitted another huge issue of£500,000 in 1711 to pay for another failed expedition againstQuebec, not only was the remainder of the silver driven fromcirculation, but, despite the legal tender law, the paper pounddepreciated 30 percent against silver. Massachusetts pounds,officially 7 shillings to the silver ounce, had now fallen on themarket to 9 shillings per ounce. Depreciation proceeded in thisand other colonies despite fierce governmental attempts tooutlaw it, backed by fines, imprisonment, and total confisca-tion of property for the high crime of not accepting the paperat par. Faced with a further “shortage of money” due to the moneyissues, Massachusetts decided to press on; in 1716, it formed agovernment “land bank” and issued £100,000 in notes to beloaned on real estate in the various counties of the province. Prices rose so dramatically that the tide of opinion in Mass-achusetts began to turn against paper, as writers pointed outthat the result of issues was a doubling of prices in the past 20years, depreciation of paper, and the disappearance of Spanishsilver through the operation of Gresham’s Law. From then on,Massachusetts, pressured by the British Crown, tried intermit-tently to reduce the bills in circulation and return to a speciecurrency, but was hampered by its assumed obligations tohonor the paper notes at par of its sister New Englandcolonies. In 1744, another losing expedition against the French ledMassachusetts to issue an enormous amount of paper moneyover the next several years. From 1744 to 1748, paper money incirculation expanded from £300,000 to £2.5 million, and thedepreciation in Massachusetts was such that silver had risen onthe market to 60 shillings an ounce, ten times the price at thebeginning of an era of paper money in 1690.

Similar consequences—dramatic inflation, shortageof specie, massive depreciation despite compulsory par laws—ensued in each colony. Thus, along with Massachusetts’ depre-ciation of 11-to-1 of its notes against specie compared to theoriginal par, Connecticut’s notes had sunk to 9-to-1 and the Car-olinas’ at 10-to-1 in 1740, and the paper of virulently inflationistRhode Island to 23-to-1 against specie. Even the least-inflatedpaper, that of Pennsylvania, had suffered an appreciation ofspecie to 80 percent over par. A detailed study of the effects of paper money in New Jerseyshows how it created a boom-bust economy over the colonialperiod. When new paper money was injected into the economy,an inflationary boom would result, to be followed by a defla-tionary depression when the paper money supply contracted.6At the end of King George’s War with France in 1748, Parlia-ment began to pressure the colonies to retire the mass of papermoney and return to a specie currency. In 1751, Great Britainprohibited all further issues of legal tender paper in New Eng-land and ordered a move toward redemption of existing issuesin specie. Finally, in 1764, Parliament extended the prohibitionof new issues to the remainder of the colonies and required thegradual retirement of outstanding notes. Following the lead of Parliament, the New England colonies,apart from Rhode Island, decided to resume specie payment andretire their paper notes rapidly at the current depreciated marketrate. The panicky opponents of specie resumption and monetarycontraction made the usual predictions in sucha situation: thatthe result would be a virtual absence of money in New Englandand the consequent ruination of all trade. Instead, however,after a brief adjustment, the resumption and retirement led toa far more prosperous trade and production—the harder moneyand lower prices attracting an inflow of specie. In fact, with54A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II6Donald L.

Indeed, wheat prices fell byless in Boston than in Philadelphia, which saw no such return tospecie in the early 1750s. Foreign exchange rates, after theresumption of specie, were highly stable, and “the restoredspecie system operated after 1750 with remarkable stabilityduring the Seven Years War and during the dislocation of inter-national payments in the last years before the Revolution.”9 Not being outlawed by government decree, specie remainedin circulation throughout the colonial period, even during theA History of Money and Banking in the United States55Before the Twentieth Century7Before Massachusetts went back to specie, it was committed to acceptthe notes of the other New England colonies at par. This provided anincentive for Rhode Island to inflate its currency wildly, for this smallcolony, with considerable purchases to make in Massachusetts, couldmake these purchases in inflated money at par. Thereby Rhode Islandcould export its inflation to the larger colony, but make its purchases withthe new money before Massachusetts prices could rise in response. Inshort, Rhode Island could expropriate wealth from Massachusetts andimpose the main cost of its inflation on the latter colony.8If Rhode Island was the most inflationary of the colonies, Maryland’smonetary expansion was the most bizarre. In 1733, Maryland’s publicland bank issued £70,000 of paper notes, of which £30,000 was given awayin a fixed amount to each inhabitant of the province. This was done touniversalize the circulation of the new notes, and is probably the closestapproximation in history of Milton Friedman’s “helicopter” model, inwhich a magical helicopter lavishes new paper money in fixed amountsof proportions to each inhabitant. The result of the measure, of course,was rapid depreciation of new notes. However, the inflationary impact ofthe notes was greatly lessened by tobacco still being the major money ofthe new colony.

Firms granting credit toconsumers and businesses had existed in the ancient worldand in medieval Europe, but these were “money lenders” wholoaned out their own savings. “Banking” in the sense of lend-ing out the savings of others only began in England with the“scriveners” of the early seventeenth century. The scrivenerswere clerks who wrote contracts and bonds and were there-fore in a position to learn of mercantile transactions andengage in money lending and borrowing.11There were, however, no banks of deposit in England untilthe civil war in the mid-seventeenth century. Merchants hadbeen in the habit of storing their surplus gold in the king’s mintfor safekeeping. That habit proved to be unfortunate, for when56A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II10Ibid., p. 591.11During the sixteenth century, before the rise of the scriveners, mostEnglish money-lending was not even conducted by specialized firms, butby wealthy merchants in the clothing and woolen industries, as outletsfor their surplus capital.

Although the merchantsfinally got their gold back, they were understandably shaken bythe experience, and forsook the mint, depositing their goldinstead in the coffers of private goldsmiths, who, like the mint,were accustomed to storing the valuable metal. The warehousereceipts of the goldsmiths soon came to be used as a surrogatefor the gold itself. By the end of the civil war, in the 1660s, thegoldsmiths fell prey to the temptation to print pseudo-ware-house receipts not covered by gold and lend them out; in thisway fractional reserve banking came to England.12 Very few private banks existed in colonial America, and theywere short-lived. Most prominent was the Massachusetts LandBank of 1740, issuing notes and lending them out on real estate.The land bank was launched as an inflationary alternative to gov-ernment paper, which the royal governor was attempting torestrict. The land bank issued irredeemable notes, and fear of itsunsound issue generated a competing private silver bank, whichemitted notes redeemable in silver. The land bank promptlyissued over £49,000 in irredeemable notes, which depreciatedvery rapidly. In six months’ time the public was almost univer-sally refusing to accept the bank’s notes and land bank sympa-thizers vainly accepting the notes.

Debtors benefit frominflation and creditors lose; realizing this fact, older historiansassumed that debtors were largely poor agrarians and creditorswere wealthy merchants and that therefore the former were themain sponsors of inflationary nostrums. But, of course, thereare no rigid “classes” of debtors and creditors; indeed, wealthymerchants and land speculators are often the heaviest debtors.Later historians have demonstrated that members of the lattergroup were the major sponsors of inflationary paper money inthe colonies.13, 14"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States59Before the Twentieth CenturyREVOLUTIONARYWARFINANCETo finance the Revolutionary War, which broke out in 1775,the Continental Congress early hit on the device of issuing fiatpaper money. The leader in the drive for paper money wasGouverneur Morris, the highly conservative young scion of theNew York landed aristocracy. There was no pledge to redeemthe paper, even in the future, but it was supposed to be retiredin seven years by taxes levied pro rata by the separate states.Thus, a heavy future tax burden was supposed to be added tothe inflation brought about by the new paper money. Theretirement pledge, however, was soon forgotten, as Congress,enchanted by this new, seemingly costless form of revenue,escalated its emissions of fiat paper. As a historian has phrasedit, “such was the beginning of the ‘federal trough,’ one ofAmerica’s most imperishable institutions.”15The total money supply of the United States at the beginningof the Revolution has been estimated at $12 million. Congresslaunched its first paper issue of $2 million in late June 1775, andbefore the notes were printed it had already concluded thatanother $1 million was needed. Before the end of the year, a full$6 million in paper issues was issued or authorized, a dramaticincrease of 50 percent in the money supply in one year. The issue of this fiat “Continental” paper rapidly escalatedover the next few years. Congress issued $6 million in 1775, $19million in 1776, $13 million in 1777, $64 million in 1778, and $125million in 1779. This was a total issue of over $225 million in fiveyears superimposed upon a pre-existing money supply of $12million. The result was, as could be expected, a rapid price infla-tion in terms of the paper notes, and a corollary acceleratingdepreciation of the paper in terms of specie. Thus, at the end of1776, the Continentals were worth $1 to $1.25 in specie; by thefall of the following year, its value had fallen to 3-to-1; byDecember 1778 the value was 6.8-to-1; and by December 1779,15Edmund Cody Burnett, The Continental Congress(New York: W.W.Norton, 1964), p. 83."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIto the negligible 42-to-1. By the spring of 1781, the Continentalswere virtually worthless, exchanging on the market at 168 paperdollars to one dollar in specie. This collapse of the Continentalcurrency gave rise to the phrase, “not worth a Continental.” To top this calamity, several states issued their own papermoney, and each depreciated at varying rates. Virginia and theCarolinas led the inflationary move, and by the end of the war,state issues added a total of 210 million depreciated dollars tothe nation’s currency. In an attempt to stem the inflation and depreciation, variousstates levied maximum price controls and compulsory par laws.The result was only to create shortages and impose hardshipson large sections of the public. Thus, soldiers were paid in Con-tinentals, but farmers understandably refused to accept pay-ment in paper money despite legal coercion. The ContinentalArmy then moved to “impress” food and other supplies, seiz-ing the supplies and forcing the farmers and shopkeepers toaccept depreciated paper in return. By 1779, with Continentalpaper virtually worthless, the Continental Army stepped up itsimpressments, “paying” for them in newly issued paper ticketsor “certificates” issued by the army quartermaster and commis-sary departments. The states followed suit with their own mas-sive certificate issues. It understandably took little time forthese certificates, federal and state, to depreciate in value tonothing; by the end of the war, federal certificate issues alonetotaled $200 million. The one redeeming feature of this monetary calamity was thatthe federal and state governments at least allowed these paperissues to sink into worthlessness without insisting that taxpayersshoulder another grave burden by being forced to redeem theseissues specie at par, or even to redeem them at all.16Continentals16As one historian explained, “Currency and certificates were the‘common debt’ of the Revolution, most of which at war’s end had beensunk at its depreciated value.

Unfortunately, the same policy was not applied to anotherimportant device that Congress turned to after its Continentalpaper had become almost worthless in 1779: loan certificates.Technically, loan certificates were public debt, but they werescarcely genuine loans. They were simply notes issued by thegovernment to pay for supplies and accepted by the merchantsbecause the government would not pay anything else. Hence,the loan certificates became a form of currency, and rapidlydepreciated. As early as the end of 1779, they had depreciatedto 24-to-1 in specie. By the end of the war, $600 million of loancertificates had been issued. Some of the later loan certificateissues were liquidated at a depreciated rate, but the bulkremained after the war to become the substantial core of thepermanent, peacetime federal debt. The mass of federal and state debt could have depreciatedand passed out of existence by the end of the war, but theprocess was stopped and reversed by Robert Morris, wealthyPhiladelphia merchant and virtual economic and financial czarof the Continental Congress in the last years of the war. Morris,leader of the nationalist forces in American politics, moved tomake the depreciated federal debt ultimately redeemable inpar and also agitated for federal assumption of the variousstate debts. The reason for this was twofold: (a) to confer a vastsubsidy on speculators who had purchased the public debt athighly depreciated values, by paying interest and principal at"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIpar in specie;18and (b) to build up agitation for taxing powerin the Congress, which the Articles of Confederation refused toallow to the federal government. The decentralist policy of thestates’ raising taxes or issuing new paper money to pay off thepro rata federal debt as well as their own was thwarted by theadoption of the Constitution, which brought about the victoryof the nationalist program, led by Morris’s youthful discipleand former aide, Alexander Hamilton. THEBANK OFNORTHAMERICARobert Morris’s nationalist vision was not confined to astrong central government, the power of the federal govern-ment to tax, and a massive public debt fastened permanentlyupon the taxpayers. Shortly after he assumed total economicpower in Congress in the spring of 1781, Morris introduced abill to create the first commercial bank, as well as the first cen-tral bank, in the history of the new Republic. This bank,headed by Morris himself, the Bank of North America, wasnot only the first fractional reserve commercial bank in theU.S.; it was to be a privately owned central bank, modeledafter the Bank of England. The money system was to begrounded upon specie, but with a controlled monetary infla-tion pyramiding an expansion of money and credit upon areserve of specie. The Bank of North America, which quickly received a federalcharter and opened its doors at the beginning of 1782, receivedthe privilege from the government of its notes being receivablein all duties and taxes to all governments, at par with specie. Inaddition, no other banks were to be permitted to operate in thecountry. In return for its monopoly license to issue paper18As Morris candidly put it, this windfall to the public debt specula-tors at the expense of the taxpayers would cause wealth to flow “intothose hands which could render it most productive.” Ferguson, Power ofthe Purse, p. 124."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States63Before the Twentieth Centurymoney, the bank would graciously lend most of its newly cre-ated money to the federal government to purchase public debtand be reimbursed by the hapless taxpayer. The Bank of NorthAmerica was made the depository for all congressional funds.The first central bank in America rapidly loaned $1.2 million tothe Congress, headed also by Robert Morris.19Despite Robert Morris’s power and influence, and themonopoly privileges conferred upon his bank, it was per-ceived in the market that the bank’s notes were being inflatedcompared with specie. Despite the nominal redeemability ofthe Bank of North America’s notes in specie, the market’s lackof confidence in the inflated notes led to their depreciationoutside its home base in Philadelphia. The bank even tried toshore up the value of the notes by hiring people to urgeredeemers of its notes not to ruin everything by insisting uponspecie—a move scarcely calculated to improve ultimate confi-dence in the bank. After a year of operation, however, Morris, his politicalpower slipping after the end of the war, moved quickly to endhis bank’s role as a central bank and to shift it to the status of aprivate commercial bank chartered by the state of Pennsylva-nia. By the end of 1783, all of the federal government’s stock inthe Bank of North America, which had the previous yearamounted to five-eighths of its capital, had been sold by Morrisinto private hands, and all U.S. government debt to the bank19When Morris failed to raise the legally required specie capital tolaunch the Bank of North America, Morris, in an act tantamount toembezzlement, simply appropriated specie loaned to the U.S. by Franceand invested it for the government in his own bank. In this way, the bulkof specie capital for his bank was appropriated by Morris out of govern-ment funds. A multiple of these funds was then borrowed back fromMorris’s bank by Morris as government financier for the pecuniary ben-efit of Morris as banker; and finally, Morris channeled most of the moneyinto war contracts for his friends and business associates.

The first experiment with a central bank in theUnited States had ended.20At the end of the Revolutionary War, the contraction of theswollen mass of paper money, combined with the resumptionof imports from Great Britain, combined to cut prices by morethan half in a few years. Vain attempts by seven state govern-ments, in the mid-1780s, to cure the “shortage of money” andreinflate prices were a complete failure. Part of the reason forthe state paper issues was a frantic attempt to pay the wartimepublic debt, state and pro rata federal, without resorting tocrippling burdens of taxation. The increased paper issuesmerely added to the “shortage” by stimulating the export ofspecie and the import of commodities from abroad. Once again,Gresham’s Law was at work. State paper issues—despite com-pulsory par laws—merely depreciated rapidly, and aggravatedthe shortage of specie. A historian discusses what happened tothe paper issues of North Carolina: In 1787–1788 the specie value of the paper had shrunk bymore than fifty percent. Coin vanished, and since the paperhad practically no value outside the state, merchants couldnot use it to pay debts they owed abroad; hence they suf-fered severe losses when they had to accept it at inflatedvalues in the settlement of local debts. North Carolina’sperformance warned merchants anew of the menace ofdepreciating paper money which they were forced to receiveat par from their debtors but which they could not pass onto their creditors.21Neither was the situation helped by the expansion of bank-ing following the launching of the Bank of North America in1782.

(Evidently the Founding Fatherswere mindful of the bleak record of colonial and Revolutionarypaper issues and provincial juggling of the weights and denom-inations of coin.) In accordance with this power, Congresspassed the Coinage Act of 1792 on the recommendation of Sec-retary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton’s “Report on the Estab-lishment of a Mint” of the year before.2522See Hammond, Banks and Politics, pp. 67, 87–88.23Nettels, National Economy, pp. 61–62. See also Hammond, Banks andPolitics, pp. 77–80, 85.24As Jefferson put it at the time: “The unit or dollar is a known coin,and the most familiar of all to the mind of the public. It is already adopt-ed from South to North, has identified our currency, and therefore hap-pily offers itself a unit already introduced.” Cited in J.

The dollar was defined as botha weight of371.25 grains of pure silver and/ora weight of 24.75 grains ofpure gold—a fixed ratio of 15 grains of silver to 1 grain ofgold.26 Anyone could bring gold and silver bullion to the mintto be coined, and silver and gold coins were both to be legal ten-der at this fixed ratio of 15-to-1. The basic silver coin was to bethe silver dollar, and the basic gold coin the $10 eagle, contain-ing 247.5 grains of pure gold.27The 15-to-1 fixed bimetallic ratio almost precisely corre-sponded to the market gold/silver ratio of the early 1790s,28butof course the tragedy of any bimetallic standard is that thefixed mint ratio must always come a cropper against inevitablychanging market ratios, and that Gresham’s Law will then comeinexorably into effect. Thus, Hamilton’s express desire to keepboth metals in circulation in order to increase the supply ofmoney was doomed to failure.29Unfortunately for the bimetallic goal, the 1780s saw thebeginning of a steady decline in the ratio of the market valuesof silver to gold, largely due to the massive increases over thenext three decades of silver production from the mines ofMexico. The result was that the market ratio fell to 15.5-to-1 bythe 1790s, and after 1805 fell to approximately 15.75-to-1. Thelatter figure was enough of a gap between the market and mintratios to set Gresham’s Law into operation so that by 1810 gold26The current Spanish silver dollars in use were lighter than the ear-lier dollars, weighing 387 grains. See Laughlin, History of Bimetallism, pp.16–18.27Golden half-eagles (worth $5) and quarter-eagles (worth $2.50) werealso to be coined, of corresponding proportional weights, and, for silvercoins, half-dollars, quarter-dollars, dimes, and half-dimes of correspon-ding weights.28Silver had declined in market value from the 14.1-to-1 ratio of 1760,largely due to the declining production of gold from Russian mines inthis period and therefore the rising relative value of gold.29See Laughlin, History of Bimetallism, p. 14."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States67Before the Twentieth Centurycoins began to disappear from the United States and silver coinsbegan to flood in. The fixed government ratio now significantlyovervalued silver and undervalued gold, so it paid people tobring in silver to exchange for gold, melt the gold coins into bul-lion and ship it abroad. From 1810 until 1834, only silver coin,domestic and foreign, circulated in the United States.30Originally, Congress provided in 1793 that all foreign coinscirculating in the United States be legal tender. Indeed, foreigncoins have been estimated to form 80 percent of Americandomestic specie circulation in 1800. Most of the foreign coinswere Spanish silver, and while the legal tender privilege wasprogressively canceled for various foreign coins by 1827, Span-ish silver coins continued as legal tender and to predominate incirculation.31Spanish dollars, however, soon began to be heav-ier in weight by 1 to 5 percent over their American equivalents,even though they circulated at face value here, and so theAmerican mint ratio overvalued American more than Spanishdollars. As a result, the Spanish silver dollars were re-exported,leaving American silver dollars in circulation. On the otherhand, fractional Spanish silver coins—half-dollars, quarter-dol-lars, dimes, and half-dimes—were considerably overvalued inthe U.S., since they circulated at face value and yet were farlighter weight. Gresham’s Law again came into play, and theresult was that American silver fractional coins were exportedand disappeared, leaving Spanish silver fractional coins as themajor currency. To make matters still more complicated, Amer-ican silver dollars, though lighter weight than the Spanish,circulated equally by name in the West Indies. As a result,30For a lucid explanation of the changing silver-gold ratios andhow Gresham’s Law operated in this period, see ibid., pp. 10–51. Seealso J.

Hamilton’s “Report on aNational Bank” of December 1790 urged such a bank, to beowned privately with the government owning one-fifth of theshares. Hamilton argued that the alleged “scarcity” of specie cur-rency needed to be overcome by infusions of paper and the newbank was to issue such paper, to be invested in the assumed fed-eral debt and in subsidy to manufacturers. The bank notes wereto be legally redeemable in specie on demand, and its notes wereto be kept at par with specie by the federal government’s accept-ing its notes in taxes—giving it a quasi–legal tender status. Also,the federal government would confer upon the bank the prestigeof being the depository for its public funds. In accordance with Hamilton’s wishes, Congress quicklyestablished the First Bank of the United States in February 1791.The charter of the bank was for 20 years, and it was assured amonopoly of the privilege of having a national charter duringthat period. In a significant gesture of continuity with the Bankof North America, the latter’s longtime Bank of North Americapresident and former partner of Robert Morris, Thomas Willingof Philadelphia, was made president of the new Bank of theUnited States. The Bank of the United States promptly fulfilled its infla-tionary potential by issuing millions of dollars in paper money32On the complex workings of fractional coins as against dollar coinsin this period, see the excellent article by David A. Martin, “Bimetallismin the United States before 1850,” Journal of Political Economy 76(May–June 1968): 428–34."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States69Before the Twentieth Centuryand demand deposits, pyramiding on top of $2 million inspecie. The Bank of the United States invested heavily in loansto the United States government. In addition to $2 millioninvested in the assumption of pre-existing long-term debtassumed by the new federal government, the Bank of theUnited States engaged in massive temporary lending to thegovernment, which reached $6.2 million by 1796.33The result ofthe outpouring of credit and paper money by the new Bank ofthe United States was an inflationary rise in prices. Thus,wholesale prices rose from an index of 85 in 1791 to a peak of146 in 1796, an increase of 72 percent.34In addition, speculationboomed in government securities and real estate values weredriven upward.35Pyramiding on top of the Bank of the UnitedStates’s expansion and aggravating the paper money expansionand the inflation was a flood of newly created commercialbanks. Whereas there were only three commercial banks beforethe founding of the United States, and only four by the estab-lishment of the Bank of the United States, eight new banks werefounded shortly thereafter, in 1791 and 1792, and 10 more by33Schultz and Caine are severely critical of these operations: “Inindebting itself heavily to the Bank of the United States, the FederalGovernment was obviously misusing its privileges and seriously endan-gering the Bank’s stability.” They also charged thatthe Federalists had saddled the government with a militaryand interest budget that threatened to topple the structure offederal finances. Despite the addition of tax after tax to therevenue system, the Federal Government’s receipts throughthe decade of the ‘90s were barely able to cling to the skirtsof its expenditures. (William J.

Thus, the Bank of the United States and its monetaryexpansion spurred the creation of 18 new banks in five years.36The establishment of the Bank of the United States precipi-tated a grave constitutional argument, the Jeffersonians arguingthat the Constitution gave the federal government no power toestablish a bank. Hamilton, in turn, paved the way for virtuallyunlimited expansion of federal power by maintaining that theConstitution “implied” a grant of power for carrying out vaguenational goals. The Hamiltonian interpretation won out offi-cially in the decision of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall inMcCulloch v. Maryland(1819).37Despite the Jeffersonian hostility to commercial and centralbanks, the Democratic-Republicans, under the control of quasi-Federalist moderates rather than militant Old Republicans,made no move to repeal the charter of the Bank of the UnitedStates before its expiration in 1811 and happily multiplied thenumber of state banks and bank credit in the next two decades.38Thus, in 1800 there were 28 state banks; by 1811, the number hadescalated to 117, a fourfold increase. In 1804, there were 64 statebanks, of which we have data on 13, or 20 percent of the banks.These reporting banks had $0.98 million in specie, as againstnotes and demand deposits outstanding of $2.82 million, a36J.

Merchants found that the bank had expended credit atcheap rates and had eased the eternal complaint about a“scarcity of money.” Even more suggestive is the support of thestate banks, which hailed the bank as “advantageous” and wor-ried about the contraction of credit if the bank were forced toliquidate. The Bank of New York, which had been founded byAlexander Hamilton, in fact lauded the Bank of the UnitedStates because it had been able “in case of any sudden pressureupon the merchants to step forward to their aid in a degreewhich the state institutions were unable to do.“41THEWAR OF1812 ANDITSAFTERMATHWar has generally had grave and fateful consequences forthe American monetary and financial system. We have seen thatthe Revolutionary War occasioned a mass of depreciated fiatpaper, worthless Continentals, a huge public debt, and thebeginnings of central banking in the Bank of North America.The Hamiltonian financial system, and even the Constitutionitself, was in large part shaped by the Federalist desire to fundthe federal and state public debt via federal taxation, and amajor reason for the establishment of the First Bank of theUnited States was to contribute to the funding of the newlyassumed federal debt. The Constitutional prohibition againststate paper money, and the implicit rebuff to all fiat paper werecertainly influenced by the Revolutionary War experience. 41Holdsworth, First Bank, p. 83.

An enormous expansion in the number ofbanks and in bank notes and deposits was spurred by the dic-tates of war finance. New England banks were more conserva-tive than in other regions, and the region was strongly opposedto the war with England, so little public debt was purchased inNew England. Yet imported goods, textile manufactures, andmunitions had to be purchased in that region by the federalgovernment. The government therefore encouraged the forma-tion of new and recklessly inflationary banks in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states, which printed hugequantities of new notes to purchase government bonds. Thefederal government thereupon used these notes to purchasemanufactured goods in New England. Thus, from 1811 to 1815 the number of banks in the countryincreased from 117 to 212; in addition, there had sprung up 35private unincorporated banks, which were illegal in most statesbut were allowed to function under war conditions. Specie inthe 30 reporting banks, 26 percent of the total number of banksof 1811, amounted to $2.57 million in 1811; this figure had risento $5.40 million in the 98 reporting banks in 1815, or 40 percentof the total. Notes and deposits, on the other hand, were $10.95million in 1811 and had increased to $31.6 million in 1815among the reporting banks. If we make the heroic assumption that we can estimate themoney supply for the country by multiplying by the proportionof unreported banks and we then add in the Bank of the UnitedStates’s totals for 1811, specie in all banks would total $14.9 mil-lion in 1811 and $13.5 million in 1815, or a 9.4 percent decrease.On the other hand, total bank notes and deposits aggregated to$42.2 million in 1811 and $79 million four years later, so that anincrease of 87.2 percent, pyramided on top of a 9.4 percentdecline in specie. If we factor in the Bank of the United States,then, the bank pyramid ratio was 3.70-to-1 and the reserve ratio0.27 in 1811; while the pyramid ratio four years later was 5.85-to-1 and the reserve ratio 0.17."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIBut the aggregates scarcely tell the whole story since, as wehave seen, the expansion took place solely outside of New Eng-land, while New England banks continued on their relativelysound basis and did not inflate their credit. The record expan-sion of the number of banks was in Pennsylvania, which incor-porated no less than 41 new banks in the month of March 1814,contrasting to only four banks which had existed in thatstate—all in Philadelphia—until that date. It is instructive tocompare the pyramid ratios of banks in various reporting statesin 1815: to only 1.96-to-1 in Massachusetts, 2.7-to-1 in NewHampshire, and 2.42-to-1 in Rhode Island, as contrasted to 19.2-to-1 in Pennsylvania, 18.46-to-1 in South Carolina, and 18.73-to-1in Virginia.42This monetary situation meant that the United States gov-ernment was paying for New England manufactured goodswith a mass of inflated bank paper outside the region. Soon, asthe New England banks called upon the other banks to redeemtheir notes in specie, the mass of inflating banks faced imminentinsolvency. It was at this point that a fateful decision was made by theU.S. government and concurred in by the governments of thestates outside New England. As the banks all faced failure, thegovernments, in August 1814, permitted all of them to suspendspecie payments—that is, to stop all redemption of notes anddeposits in gold or silver—and yet to continue in operation. Inshort, in one of the most flagrant violations of property rights inAmerican history, the banks were permitted to waive their con-tractual obligations to pay in specie while they themselvescould expand their loans and operations and force their owndebtors to repay their loans as usual. Indeed, the number of banks, and bank credit, expandedrapidly during 1815 as a result of this governmental carte42Van Fenstermaker, “Statistics,” pp. 401–09.

It was precisely during 1815 when virtually all the pri-vate banks sprang up, the number of banks increasing in oneyear from 208 to 246. Reporting banks increased their pyramidratios from 3.17-to-1 in 1814 to 5.85-to-1 the following year, adrop of reserve ratios from 0.32 to 0.17. Thus, if we measurebank expansion by pyramiding and reserve ratios, we see that amajor inflationary impetus during the War of 1812 came duringthe year 1815 after specie payments had been suspendedthroughout the country by government action. Historians dedicated to the notion that central banks restrainstate or private bank inflation have placed the blame for themultiplicity of banks and bank credit inflation during the Warof 1812 on the absence of a central bank. But as we have seen,both the number of banks and bank credit grew apace duringthe period of the First Bank of the United States, pyramiding ontop of the latter’s expansion, and would continue to do sounder the Second Bank, and, for that matter, the FederalReserve System in later years. And the federal government, notthe state banks themselves, is largely to blame for encouragingnew, inflated banks to monetize the war debt. Then, in particu-lar, it allowed them to suspend specie payment in August 1814,and to continue that suspension for two years after the war wasover, until February 1817. Thus, for two and a half years bankswere permitted to operate and expand while issuing what wastantamount to fiat paper and bank deposits. Another neglected responsibility of the U.S. government forthe wartime inflation was its massive issue of Treasury notes tohelp finance the war effort. While this Treasury paper was inter-est-bearing and was redeemable in specie in one year, thecumulative amount outstanding functioned as money, as it wasused in transactions among the public and was also employedas reserves or “high-powered money” by the expanding banks.The fact that the government received the Treasury notes for alldebts and taxes gave the notes a quasi–legal tender status. Mostof the Treasury notes were issued in 1814 and 1815, when theiroutstanding total reached $10.65 million and $15.46 million,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIrespectively. Not only did the Treasury notes fuel the bank infla-tion, but their quasi–legal tender status brought Gresham’s Lawinto operation and specie flowed out of the banks and publiccirculation outside of New England, and into New England andout of the country.43The expansion of bank money and Treasury notes during thewar drove up prices in the United States. Wholesale priceincreases from 1811 to 1815 averaged 35 percent, with differentcities experiencing a price inflation ranging from 28 percent to 55percent. Since foreign trade was cut off by the war, prices ofimported commodities rose far more, averaging 70 percent.44Butmore important than this inflation, and at least as important asthe wreckage of the monetary system during and after the war,was the precedent that the two-and-a-half-year-long suspensionof specie payment set for the banking system for the future.From then on, every time there was a banking crisis brought onby inflationary expansion and demands for redemption inspecie, state and federal governments looked the other way andpermitted general suspension of specie payments while bankoperations continued to flourish. It thus became clear to thebanks that in a general crisis they would not be required to meetthe ordinary obligations of contract law or of respect for prop-erty rights, so their inflationary expansion was permanentlyencouraged by this massive failure of government to fulfill itsobligation to enforce contracts and defend the rights of property. Suspensions of specie payments informally or officially per-meated the economy outside of New England during the panic43For a perceptive discussion of the nature and consequences ofTreasury note issue in this period, see Richard H. Timberlake, Jr., TheOrigins of Central Banking in the United States(Cambridge, Mass.: HarvardUniversity Press, 1978), pp. 13–18.

A gen-eral suspension of specie payments occurred throughout thecountry once again in the panic of 1857.45It is important to realize, then, in evaluating the Americanbanking system before the Civil War, that even in the later yearswhen there was no central bank, the system was not “free” inany proper economic sense. “Free” banking can only refer to asystem in which banks are treated as any other business, andthat therefore failure to obey contractual obligations—in thiscase, prompt redemption of notes and deposits in specie—mustincur immediate insolvency and liquidation. Burdened by thetradition of allowing general suspensions that arose in theUnited States in 1814, the pre–Civil War banking system,despite strong elements of competition when not saddled witha central bank, must rather be termed in the phrase of one econ-omist, as “Decentralization without Freedom.”4645On the suspensions of specie payments, and on their importancebefore the Civil War, see Vera C. Smith, The Rationale of Central Banking(London: P.S. King and Son, 1936), pp. 38–46. See also Dunne, MonetaryDecisions, p. 26.46Smith, Rationale, p. 36. Smith properly defines “free banking” as a regime where note-issuing banks are allowed to set up inthe same way as any other type of business enterprise, solong as they comply with the general company law. Therequirement for their establishment is not special condition-al authorization from a government authority, but the abilityto raise sufficient capital, and public confidence, to gainacceptance for their notes and ensure the profitability of theundertaking. Under such a system all banks would not onlybe allowed the same rights, but would also be subjected tothe same responsibilities as other business enterprises. Ifthey failed to meet their obligations they would be declaredbankrupt and put into liquidation, and their assets used tomeet the claims of their creditors, in which case the share-holders would lose the whole or part of their capital, and thepenalty for failure would be paid, at least for the most part,by those responsible for the policy of the bank. Notes issued"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIFrom the 1814–1817 experience on, the notes of state banks cir-culated at varying rates of depreciation, depending on publicexpectations of how long they would be able to keep redeemingtheir obligations in specie. These expectations, in turn, were heav-ily influenced by the amount of notes and deposits issued by thebank as compared with the amount of specie held in its vaults. In that era of poor communications and high transportationcosts, the tendency for a bank note was to depreciate in propor-tion to its distance from the home office. One effective, if time-consuming, method of enforcing redemption on nominallyspecie-paying banks was the emergence of a class of profes-sional “money brokers.” These brokers would buy up a mass ofdepreciated notes of nominally specie-paying banks, and thentravel to the home office of the bank to demand redemption inspecie. Merchants, money brokers, bankers, and the generalpublic were aided in evaluating the various state bank notes bythe development of monthly journals known as “bank notedetectors.” These “detectors” were published by money brokersand periodically evaluated the market rate of various banknotes in relation to specie.47“Wildcat” banks were so named because in that age of poortransportation, banks hoping to inflate and not worry aboutredemption attempted to locate in “wildcat” country wheremoney brokers would find it difficult to travel. It should benoted that if it were not for periodic suspension, there wouldunder this system would be “promises to pay,” and suchobligations must be met on demand in the generally accept-ed medium which we will assume to be gold. No bankwould have the right to call on the government or on anyother institution for special help in time of need. . . . A gen-eral abandonment of the gold standard is inconceivableunder these conditions, and with a strict interpretation of thebankruptcy laws any bank suspending payments would atonce be put into the hands of a receiver.

It can be imagined that the advent of the money broker wasnot precisely welcomed in the town of an errant bank, and itwas easy for the townspeople to blame the resulting collapse ofbank credit on the sinister stranger rather than on the friendlyneighborhood banker. During the panic of 1819, when bankscollapsed after an inflationary boom lasting until 1817, obsta-cles and intimidation were often the lot of those who attemptedto press the banks to fulfill their contractual obligation to pay inspecie. Thus, Maryland and Pennsylvania, during the panic of 1819,engaged in almost bizarre inconsistency in this area. Maryland,on February 15, 1819, enacted a law “to compel . . . banks to payspecie for their notes, or forfeit their charters.” Yet two days afterthis seemingly tough action, it passed another law relievingbanks of any obligation to redeem notes held by money brokers,“the major force ensuring the people of this state from the evilarising from the demands made on the banks of this state forgold and silver by brokers.” Pennsylvania followed suit a monthlater. In this way, these states could claim to maintain the virtueof enforcing contract and property rights while moving to pre-vent the most effective method of ensuring such enforcement. During the 1814–1817 general suspension, noteholders whosued for specie payment seldom gained satisfaction in thecourts. Thus, Isaac Bronson, a prominent Connecticut banker ina specie-paying region, sued various New York banks for pay-ment of notes in specie. He failed to get satisfaction, and for hispains received only abuse in the New York press as an agent of“misery and ruin.”4848Hammond, Banks and Politics, pp. 179–80. Even before the suspen-sion, in 1808, a Bostonian named Hireh Durkee who attempted to demandspecie for $9,000 in notes of the state-owned Vermont State Bank, was metby an indictment for an attempt by this “evil-disposed person” to “realize"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIThe banks south of Virginia largely went off specie paymentduring the panic of 1819, and in Georgia at least general sus-pension continued almost continuously to the 1830s.

In North Car-olina, banks were not penalized by the legislature for suspend-ing specie payments to “brokers,” while maintaining them toothers. Backed by government, the three leading banks of thestate met and agreed, in June 1819, not to pay specie to brokersor their agents. Their notes immediately fell to a 15-percent dis-count outside the state. However, the banks continued torequire—ignoring the inconsistency—that their own debtorspay them at par in specie.

It was apparent that there were two ways outof the problem: one was the hard-money path, which was advo-cated by the Old Republicans and, for their own purposes, theFederalists. The federal and state governments would havesternly compelled the rollicking banks to redeem promptly inspecie, and, when most of the banks outside of New Englandcould not, to force them to liquidate. In that way, the mass ofdepreciated and inflated notes and deposits would have beenswiftly liquidated, and specie would have poured back out ofhoards and into the country to supply a circulating medium.The inflationary experience would have been over. Instead, the Democratic-Republican establishment in 1816turned to the old Federalist path: a new central bank, a SecondBank of the United States. Modeled closely after the First Bank,the Second Bank, a private corporation with one-fifth of theshares owned by the federal government, was to create anational paper currency, purchase a large chunk of the publicdebt, and receive deposits of Treasury funds. The Second Bankof the United States’s notes and deposits were to be redeemablein specie, and they were given quasi–legal tender status by thefederal government’s receiving them in payment of taxes. That the purpose of establishing the Second Bank of theUnited States was to support the state banks in their inflation-ary course rather than crack down on them is seen by theshameful deal that the Second Bank made with the state banksas soon as it opened its doors in January 1817. At the same timethat it was establishing the new bank in April 1816, Congresspassed a resolution of Daniel Webster, at that time a Federalistchampion of hard money, requiring that after February 20, 1817,the United States should accept as payments for debts or taxesonly specie, Treasury notes, Bank of the United States notes, orstate bank notes redeemable in specie on demand.

Instead of using the opportunity to compel the banks toredeem, however, the Second Bank of the United States, in ameeting with representatives from the leading urban banks,excluding Boston, agreed to issue $6 million worth of credit inNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Virginia before insist-ing on specie payments from debts due to it from the statebanks. In return for that agreed-upon massive inflation, thestate banks graciously consented to resume specie payments.55Moreover, the Second Bank and the state banks agreed to mutu-ally support each other in any emergency, which of coursemeant in practice that the far stronger Bank of the United Stateswas committed to the propping up of the weaker state banks. The Second Bank of the United States was pushed throughCongress by the Madison administration and particularly bySecretary of the Treasury Alexander J. Dallas, whose appoint-ment was lobbied for, for that purpose. Dallas, a wealthyPhiladelphia lawyer, was a close friend, counsel, and financialassociate of Philadelphia merchant and banker Stephen Girard,reputedly one of the two wealthiest men in the country. Towardthe end of its term, Girard was the largest stockholder of theFirst Bank of the United States, and during the War of 1812Girard became a very heavy investor in the war debt of the fed-eral government. Both as a prospective large stockholder and asa way to unload his public debt, Girard began to agitate for anew Bank of the United States. Dallas’s appointment as secre-tary of Treasury in 1814 was successfully engineered by Dallasand his close friend, wealthy New York merchant and fur traderJohn Jacob Astor, also a heavy investor in the war debt.

Thus, Senator William H.Wells, Federalist from Delaware, in arguing against the bankbill, said that it wasostensibly for the purpose of correcting the diseased state ofour paper currency by restraining and curtailing the overis-sue of bank paper, and yet it came prepared to inflict uponus the same evil, being itself nothing more than simply apaper-making machine.57In fact, the result of the deal with the state banks was that theirresumption of specie payments after 1817 was more nominalthan real, thereby setting the stage for the widespread suspen-sions of the 1819–21 depression. As Bray Hammond writes: [S]pecie payments were resumed, with substantial short-comings. Apparently the situation was better than it hadbeen, and a pretense was maintained of its being better thanit was. But redemption was not certain and universal; therewas still a premium on specie and still a discount on banknotes, with considerable variation in both from place toplace.

As Catterall points out, “so many influentialpeople were interested in the [state banks] as stockholders thatit was not advisable to give offense by demanding payment inspecie, and borrowers were anxious to keep the banks in thehumor to lend.” When the Bank of the United States did try tocollect on state bank notes in specie, bank President Jonesreported, “the banks, our debtors, plead inability, requireunreasonable indulgence, or treat our reiterated claims andexpostulations with settled indifference.”59From its inception, the Second Bank launched a spectacularinflation of money and credit. Lax about insisting on the requiredpayment of its capital in specie, the bank failed to raise the $7million legally supposed to have been subscribed in specie;instead, during 1817 and 1818, its specie held never rose above$2.5 million. At the peak of its initial expansion, in July 1818, theBank of the United States’s specie totaled $2.36 million, and itsaggregate notes and deposits totaled $21.8 million. Thus, in ascant year and a half of operation, the Second Bank of the UnitedStates had added a net of $19.2 million to the nation’s moneysupply, for a pyramid ratio of 9.24, or a reserve ratio of 0.11.

It is no accident that three-fifths of all ofthe bank’s loans were made at these two branches.60Also, thebank’s attempt to provide a uniform currency throughout thenation floundered on the fact that the western and southernbranches could inflate credit and bank notes and that theinflated notes would wend their way to the more conservativebranches in New York and Boston, which would be obligated toredeem the inflated notes at par. In this way, the conservativebranches were stripped of specie while the western branchescould continue to inflate unchecked.61The expansionary operations of the Second Bank of theUnited States, coupled with its laxity toward insisting on speciepayment by the state banks, impelled a further inflationaryexpansion of state banks on top of the spectacular enlargementof the central bank. Thus, the number of incorporated statebanks rose from 232 in 1816 to 338 in 1818. Kentucky alone char-tered 40 new banks in the 1817–18 legislative session.

Far from being the ignorant bumpkinsthat most historians have depicted, the Jacksonians weresteeped in the knowledge of sound economics, particularly ofthe Ricardian Currency School. Indeed, no movement in American politics has been as fla-grantly misunderstood by historians as the Jacksonians. Theywere emphatically not, as historians until recently havedepicted, either “ignorant anti-capitalist agrarians,” or “repre-sentatives of the rising entrepreneurial class,” or “tools of theinflationary state banks,” or embodiments of an early proletar-ian anticapitalist movement or a nonideological power group or“electoral machine.” The Jacksonians were libertarians, plainand simple. Their program and ideology were libertarian; theystrongly favored free enterprise and free markets, but they justas strongly opposed special subsidies and monopoly privilegesconveyed by government to business or to any other group.They favored absolutely minimal government, certainly at thefederal level, but also at the state level. They believed that gov-ernment should be confined to upholding the rights of privateproperty. In the monetary sphere, this meant the separation ofgovernment from the banking system and a shift from infla-tionary paper money and fractional reserve banking to purespecie and banks confined to 100-percent reserves. In order to put this program into effect, however, the Jackso-nians faced the grueling task of creating a new party out of68Rothbard, Panic of 1819, p. 188."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIwhat had become a one-party system after the War of 1812, inwhich the Democrat-Republicans had ended up adopting theFederalist program, including the re-establishing of the Bank ofthe United States. The new party, the Democratic Party, waslargely forged in the mid-1820s by New York political leader,Martin Van Buren, newly converted by the aging Thomas Jef-ferson to the laissez-faire cause. Van Buren cemented an alliancewith Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and the Old Republicansof Virginia, but he needed a charismatic leader to take the pres-idency away from Adams and what was becoming known asthe National Republican Party. He found that leader in AndrewJackson, who was elected president under the new Democraticbanner in 1828. The Jacksonians eventually managed to put into effect vari-ous parts of their free-market and minimal-government eco-nomic program, including a drastic lowering of tariffs, and forthe first and probably the last time in American history, payingoff the federal debt. But their major concentration was on theissue of money and banking. Here they had a coherent program,which they proceeded to install in rapidly succeeding stages. The first important step was to abolish central banking, inthe Jacksonian view the major inflationary culprit. The objectwas not to eliminate the Bank of the United States in order tofree the statebanks for inflationary expansion, but, on the con-trary, to eliminate the major source of inflation before pro-ceeding, on the state level, to get rid of fractional reserve bank-ing.

The host of National Republicans andnon-Jacksonian Democrats proceeded to pass the recharter bill,but Jackson, in a dramatic message, vetoed the bill, and Con-gress failed to pass it over his veto. Triumphantly re-elected on the bank issue in 1832, PresidentJackson lost no time in disestablishing the Bank of the UnitedStates as a central bank. The critical action came in 1833, whenJackson removed the public Treasury deposits from the Bank ofthe United States and placed them in a number of state banks(soon labeled as “pet banks”) throughout the country. The orig-inal number of pet banks was seven, but the Jacksonians werenot interested in creating a privileged bank oligarchy to replacethe previous monopoly; so the number of pet banks hadincreased to 91 by the end of 1836.70In that year, Biddle man-aged to secure a Pennsylvania charter for his bank, and the newUnited States Bank of Pennsylvania functioned as a much-reduced but still influential state bank for a few years thereafter. Orthodox historians have long maintained that by his reck-less act of destroying the Bank of the United States and shiftinggovernment funds to the numerous pet banks, Andrew Jacksonfreed the state banks from the restraints imposed on them by acentral bank. Thus, the banks were supposedly allowed topyramid notes and deposits rashly on top of existing specie andprecipitate a wild inflation that was later succeeded by twobank panics and a disastrous deflation. Recent historians, however, have totally reversed this con-ventional picture.71In the first place, the record of bank infla-tion under the regime of the Bank of the United States was70Hammond, Banks and Politics, p. 420.71For an excellent biographical essay and critique of historical inter-pretations of Jacksonism and the Bank War, see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel,“The Jacksonians, Banking, and Economic Theory: A Reinterpretation,”Journal of Libertarian Studies2 (Summer 1978): 151–65."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIscarcely ideal. From the depths of the post-1819 depression inJanuary 1820 to January 1823, under the regime of the conser-vative Langdon Cheves, the Bank of the United Statesincreased its notes and deposits at an annual rate of 5.9 percent.The nation’s total money supply remained about the same inthat period. Under the far more inflationist regime of NicholasBiddle, however, the Bank of the United States’s notes anddeposits rose, after January 1823, from $12 million to $42.1 mil-lion, an annual increase of 27.9 percent. As a consequence ofthis base of the banking pyramid inflating so sharply, the totalmoney supply during this period vaulted from $81 million to$155 million, an annual increase of 10.2 percent. It is clear thatthe driving force for monetary expansion was the Bank of theUnited States, which acted as an inflationary rather than arestraining force upon the state banks. Looking at the figuresanother way, the 1823 data represented a pyramid ratio ofmoney liabilities to specie of 3.86-to-1 on the part of the Bankof the United States and 4-to-1 of the banking system as awhole, or respective reserve ratios of 0.26 and 0.25. By 1832, incontrast, the Bank of the United States’s reserve ratio had fallento 0.17 and the country as a whole to 0.15. Both sets of institu-tions had inflated almost precisely proportionately on top ofspecie.72The fact that wholesale prices remained about the same overthis period is no indication that the monetary inflation was notimproper and dangerous. As “Austrian” business cycle theoryhas pointed out, any bank credit inflation sets up conditions forboom-and-bust; there is no need for prices actually to rise. Thereason that prices did not rise was that the increased produc-tion of goods and services sufficed to offset the monetaryexpansion during this period. But similar conditions of the1920s precipitated the great crash of 1929, an event that72For the Bank of the United States data, see Catterall, Second Bank,p. 503; for total money supply, see Peter Temin, The Jacksonian Economy(New York: W.W.

In reality, the unhampered free-market economywill usually increase the supply of goods and services andthereby bring about a gently falling price level, as happened inmost of the nineteenth century except during wartime. What, then, of the consequences of Jackson’s removal of thedeposits? What of the fact that wholesale prices rose from 84 inApril 1834, to 131 in February 1837, a remarkable increase of 52percent in a little less than three years? Wasn’t that boom due tothe abolition of central banking? An excellent reversal of the orthodox explanation of the boomof the 1830s, and indeed of the ensuing panic, has been providedby Professor Temin.73First, he points out that the price inflationreally began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years toreach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is sim-ple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annualrise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the totalmoney supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 mil-lion a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent.Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by thestill-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased itsnotes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from atotal of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years ofthe 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dom-inant central bank. But what of the notable inflation after 1833?There is no doubt that the cause of the price inflation was the73Temin, Jacksonian Economy, passim.

For thetotal money supply rose from $150 million at the beginning of1833 to $267 million at the beginning of 1837, an astonishing riseof 84 percent, or 21 percent per annum. But as Temin points out, this monetary inflation was notcaused by the liberated state banks expanding to a fare-thee-well. If it were true that the state banks used their freedom andtheir new federal government deposits to pyramid wildly onthe top of specie, then their pyramid ratio would have risen agreat deal, or, conversely, their reserve ratio of specie to notesand deposits would have fallen sharply. Yet the banks’ reserveratio was 0.16 at the beginning of 1837. During the interveningyears, the reserve ratio was never below this figure. But thismeans that the state banks did no more pyramiding after thedemise of the Bank of the United States as a central bank thanthey had done before.74Conventional historians, believing that the Bank of theUnited States musthave restrained the expansion of state banks,naturally assumed that they were hostile to the central bank.But now Jean Wilburn has discovered that the state banks over-whelmingly supported the Bank of the United States: We have found that Nicholas Biddle was correct when hesaid, “state banks in the main are friendly.” Specifically, onlyin Georgia, Connecticut, and New York was there positiveevidence of hostility. A majority of state banks in some statesof the South, such as North Carolina and Alabama, gavestrong support to the Bank as did both the Southwest statesof Louisiana and Mississippi. Since Virginia gave some sup-port, we can claim that state banks in the South and South-west for the most part supported the Bank. New England,contrary to expectations, showed the banks of Vermont andNew Hampshire behind the Bank, but support of Massa-chusetts was both qualitatively and quantitatively weak.74Temin, Jacksonian Economy, pp. 68–74."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States97Before the Twentieth CenturyThe banks of the Middle states all supported the SecondBank except for those of New York.75What, then, was the cause of the enormous monetary expan-sion of the 1830s? It was a tremendous and unusual expansionof the stock of specie in the nation’s banks. The supply ofspecie in the country had remained virtually constant at about$32 million, from the beginning of 1823 until the beginning of1833. But the proportion of specie to bank notes, held by thepublic as money, dropped during this period from 23 percentto 5 percent, so that more specie flowed from the public intothe banks to fuel the relatively moderate monetary expansionof the 1820s. But starting at the beginning of 1833, the totalspecie in the country rose swiftly from $31 million to $73 mil-lion at the beginning of 1837, for a rise of 141.9 percent or 35.5percent per annum. Hence, even though increasing distrust ofbanks led the public to withdraw some specie from them, sothat the public now held 13 percent of its money in specieinstead of 5 percent, the banks were able to increase their notesand deposits at precisely the same rate as the expansion ofspecie flowing into their coffers. Thus, the Jackson administration is absolved from blame forthe 1833–37 inflation. In a sense, the state banks are as well; cer-tainly, they scarcely acted as if being “freed” by the demise of theBank of the United States. Instead, they simply increased theirmoney issues proportionately with the huge increase of specie.Of course, the basic fractional reserve banking system is scarcelyabsolved from responsibility, since otherwise the monetaryexpansion in absolute terms would not have been as great.7675Jean Alexander Wilburn, Biddle’s Bank: The Crucial Years(New York:Columbia University Press, 1979), pp. 118–19, quoted in Hummel,“Jacksonians,” p. 155.76Moreover, if the Jacksonians had been able to move more rapidly inreturning the banking system to a 100-percent-specie basis, they couldhave used the increase in specie to ease the monetary contractionrequired by a return to a pure specie money."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIThe enormous increase in specie was the result of two fac-tors: first and foremost, a large influx of silver coin from Mex-ico, and second, the sharp cut in the usual export of silver to theOrient. The latter was due to the substantial increases in China’spurchase of opium instead of silver from abroad. The influx ofsilver was the result of paper money inflation by the Mexicangovernment, which drove Mexican silver coins into the UnitedStates, where they circulated as legal tender. The influx of Mex-ican coin has been attributed to a possible increase in the pro-ductivity of the Mexican mines, but this makes little sense, sincethe inflow stopped permanently as soon as 1837. The actualcause was an inflation of the Mexican currency by the SantaAnna regime, which financed its deficits during this period byminting highly debased copper coins. Since the debased coppergrossly overvalued copper and undervalued gold and silver,both of the latter metals proceeded to flow rapidly out of Mex-ico until they virtually disappeared. Silver, of course, and notgold, was flowing into the United States during this period.Indeed, the Mexican government was forced to rescind itsactions in 1837 by shifting the copper coinage to its proper ratio.The influx of Mexican silver into the U.S. promptly ceased.77A bank credit inflation the magnitude of that of the 1830s isbound to run into shoals that cause the banks to stop the expansionand begin to contract. As the banks expand, and prices rise,specie is bound to flow out of the country and into the hands ofthe domestic public, and the pressure on the banks to redeem inspecie will intensify, forcing cessation of the boom and even mon-etary contraction. In a sense, the immediate precipitating cause isof minor importance. Even so, the Jackson administration hasbeen unfairly blamed for precipitating the panic of 1837 by issu-ing the Specie Circular in 1836. 77Mexico was pinpointed as the source of the inflow of specie byTemin, Jacksonian Economy, p. 80, while the disclosure of the cause inMexican copper inflation came in Rockoff, “Money, Prices, and Banks,”p. 454."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States99Before the Twentieth CenturyIn 1836 the Jackson administration decided to stop the enor-mous speculation in Western public lands that had been fueledduring the past two years by the inflation of bank credit. Hence,Jackson decreed that public land payments would have to bemade in specie. This had the healthy effect of stopping publicland speculation, but recent studies have shown that the SpecieCircular had very little impact in putting pressure on the banksto pay specie.78From the point of view of the Jacksonian pro-gram, however, it was as important as moving toward puttingthe U.S. government finances on a purely specie basis. Another measure advancing the Jacksonian program was alsotaken in 1836. Jackson, embarrassed at the government havingamassed a huge budget surplus during his eight years in office,ordered the Treasury to distribute the surplus proportionately tothe states. The distribution was made in notes presumablypayable in specie. But again, Temin has shown that the distribu-tion had little impact on movements of specie between banks andtherefore in exerting contractionist pressure upon them.79What, then, was the precipitating factor in triggering the panicof 1837? Temin plausibly argues that the Bank of England, wor-ried about inflation in Britain, and the consequent outflow ofgold, tightened the money supply and raised interest rates in thelatter half of 1836. As a result, credit contraction severely78Public land sales by the federal government, which had been goingsteadily at approximately $4 million–$6 million per year, suddenly spurt-ed upward in 1835 and 1836, to $16.2 million and $24.9 million respec-tively. The latter was the largest sale of public lands in American history,and the 1835 figure was the second largest. Temin, Jacksonian Economy,p. 124.

Banks throughout the United States—includ-ing the Bank of the United States—promptly suspended speciepayments in May 1837, their notes depreciated at varying rates,and interregional trade within the country was crippled. While banks were able to evade specie payments and con-tinue operations, they were still obliged to contract credit inorder to go back on specie eventually, since they could not hopeto be creating fiat money indefinitely and be allowed to remainin business. Finally, the New York banks were compelled by lawto resume paying their contractual obligations, and the otherbanks followed in the fall of 1838. During the year 1837, themoney supply fell from $276 million to $232 million, a largedrop of 15.6 percent in one year. Total specie in the country con-tinued to increase in 1837, up to $88 million, but growing pub-lic distrust of the banks (reflected in an increase in the propor-tion of money held as specie from 13 percent to 23 percent) putenough pressure upon the banks to force the contraction. Thebanks’ reserve ratio rose from 0.16 to 0.20. In response to themonetary contraction, wholesale prices fell precipitately, byover 30 percent in seven months, declining from 131 in Febru-ary 1837 to 98 in September of that year.

Leading the boom of 1838 were state governments, who, find-ing themselves with the unexpected windfall of a distributedsurplus from the federal government, proceeded to spend themoney wildly and borrow even more extravagantly on publicworks and other uneconomic forms of “investment.” But thestate governments engaged in rashly optimistic plans that their"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States101Before the Twentieth Centurypublic works would be financed heavily from Britain and othercountries, and the cotton boom on which these hopes dependedcollapsed again in 1839. The states had to abandon their projectsen masse. Cotton prices declined, and severe contractionist pres-sure was put on trade. Furthermore, the Philadelphia-basedBank of the United States had invested heavily in cotton specu-lation, and the falling price of cotton forced the Bank of theUnited States, once again, to suspend payments in October1839. This touched off a wave of general bank suspensions inthe south and west, but this time the banks of New York andNew England continued to redeem their obligations in specie.Finally, the Bank of the United States, having for the last timeplayed a leading role in generating a recession and monetarycrisis, was forced to close its doors two years later. With the crisis of 1839 there ensued four years of massivemonetary and price deflation. Unsound banks were finallyeliminated; unsound investments generated in the boom wereliquidated. The number of banks during these four years fell by23 percent.

In 1820, the total indebtedness of American states was amodest $12.8 million; by 1830, it rose to $26.5 million. But thenit started to escalate, reaching $66.5 million in 1835 and sky-rocketing to $170 million by 1839. The collapse of money, creditbanking, and prices after 1839 brought these state debts intojeopardy. At this point, the Whigs, taking a leaf from their fore-bears, the Federalists, agitated for the federal government tobail out the states and assume their debts.80After the crisis of 183980See Reginald C.

The Whigs pressed further for federal assumption ofthe debt, with the federal government to issue $200 millionworth of bonds in payment. Furthermore, British bankers putsevere pressure on the United States to assume the state debts ifit expected to float further loans abroad. The American people, however, spurned federal aid, includ-ing even the citizens of the states in difficulty, and the adventof the Polk administration ended any prospects for federalassumption. The British noted in wonder that the averageAmerican was far more concerned about his personal debts toother individuals and banks than about the debts of his state.In fact, the people were quite willing to have the states repudi-ate their debts outright. Demonstrating an astute perception ofthe reckless course the states had taken, the typical Americanresponse to the problem, “Suppose foreign capitalists did notlend any more to the states?” was the sharp retort was, “Wellwho cares if they don’t? We are now as a community heels overhead in debt and can scarcely pay the interest.”81The implica-tion was that the disappearance of foreign credit to the stateswould have the healthy effect of cutting off their wastefulspending—as well as avoiding the imposition of a crippling taxburden to pay for the interest and principal. There was in thisresponse an awareness by the public that they and their gov-ernment were separate and sometimes even hostile entitiesrather than one and the same organism.8281McGrane, Foreign Bondholders, pp. 39–40.82The Americans also pointed out that the banks, including the Bankof the United States, which were presuming to denounce repudiation ofstate debt, had already suspended specie payments and were largelyresponsible for the contraction. “Let the bondholders look to the UnitedStates Bank and to the other banks for their payment declared the peo-ple.” Ibid., p. 48."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States103Before the Twentieth CenturyBy 1847, four western and southern states (Mississippi,Arkansas, Michigan, and Florida) had repudiated all or part oftheir debts. Six other states (Maryland, Illinois, Indiana,Louisiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania) had defaulted fromthree to six years before resuming payment. It is evident, then, that the 1839–1843 contraction was health-ful for the economy in liquidating unsound investments, debts,and banks, including the pernicious Bank of the United States.But didn’t the massive deflation have catastrophic effects—onproduction, trade, and employment, as we have been led tobelieve? In a fascinating analysis and comparison with thedeflation of 1929–1933 a century later, Professor Temin showsthat the percentage of deflation over the comparable four years(1839–1843 and 1929–1933) was almost the same.83Yet theeffects on real production of the two deflations were very dif-ferent. Whereas in 1929–1933, real gross investment fell cata-strophically by 91 percent, real consumption by 19 percent, andreal GNP by 30 percent; in 1839–1843, investment fell by 23 per-cent, but real consumption increasedby 21 percent and real GNPby 16 percent. The interesting problem is to account for theenormous fall in production and consumption in the 1930s, ascontrasted to the rise in production and consumption in the1840s. It seems that only the initial months of the contractionworked a hardship on the American public and that most of theearlier deflation was a period of economic growth. Temin prop-erly suggests that the reason can be found in the downwardflexibility of prices in the nineteenth century, so that massivemonetary contraction would lower prices but not particularlycripple the world of real production or standards of living. Incontrast, in the 1930s government placed massive roadblockson the downward fall of prices and wage rates and hence83In 1839–43, the money supply, as we have seen, fell by 34 percent,wholesale prices by 42 percent, and the number of banks by 23 percent.In 1929–33, the money supply fell by 27 percent, prices by 31 percent, andthe number of banks by 42 percent.

The Jacksonians had no intention of leaving a permanent sys-tem of pet banks, and so after the retirement of Jackson, his suc-cessor, Martin Van Buren, fought to establish the IndependentTreasury System, in which the federal government conferred nospecial privilege or inflationary prop on any bank; instead of acentral bank or pet banks, the government was to keep its fundspurely in specie, in its own Treasury vaults—or its “subtrea-sury” branches—and simply take in and spend funds fromthere. Van Buren finally managed to establish the IndependentTreasury System, which would last until the Civil War. At longlast, the Jacksonians had achieved their dream of severing thefederal government totally from the banking system and plac-ing its finances on a purely hard-money, specie basis. THEJACKSONIANSAND THECOINAGELEGISLATION OF1834 We have seen that the Coinage Act of 1792 established abimetallic system in which the dollar was defined as equalingboth 371.25 grains of pure silver and 24.75 grains of puregold—a fixed weight ratio of 15 grains of silver to 1 grain ofgold. But bimetallism foundered on Gresham’s Law. After1805, the world market value of silver fell to approximately15.75-to-1, so that the U.S. fixed mint ratio greatly undervaluedgold and overvalued silver. As a result gold flowed out of thecountry and silver flowed in, so that after 1810 only silver coin,largely overvalued Spanish-American fractional silver coin, cir-culated within the United States. The rest of the currency wasinflated bank paper in various stages of depreciation. The Jacksonians, as we have seen, were determined to elimi-nate inflationary paper money and substitute a hard money con-sisting of specie—or, at the most—of paper 100-percent-backedby gold or silver. On the federal level, this meant abolishing theBank of the United States and establishing the independent Trea-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States105Before the Twentieth Centurysury. The rest of the fight would have to be conducted during the1840s and later, at the state level where the banks were char-tered. But one thing the federal government could do was read-just the specie coinage. In particular, the Jacksonians were anx-ious to eliminate small-denomination bank notes ($20 andunder) and substitute gold and silver coins for them. They rea-soned that the average American largely used these coins, andthey were the ones bilked by inflated paper money. For a stan-dard to be really gold and silver, it was vital that gold or silvercoins circulate and be used as a medium of exchange by theaverage American. To accomplish this goal, the Jacksonians set about to estab-lish a comprehensive program. As one vital step, one of theCoinage Acts of 1834 readjusted the old mint ratio of 15-to-1that had undervalued gold and driven it out of circulation.The Coinage Act devalued the definition of the gold dollarfrom the original 24.75 grains to 23.2 grains, a debasement ofgold by 6.26 percent. The silver dollar was left at the oldweight of 371.25 grains, so that the mint ratio between silverand gold was now fixed at a ratio of 16-to-1, replacing the old15-to-1. It was unfortunate that the Jacksonians did not appre-ciate silver (to 396 grains) instead of debasing gold, for this seta precedent for debasement that was to plague America in1933 and after.84The new ratio of 16-to-1, however, now undervalued silverand overvalued gold, since the world market ratio had beenapproximately 15.79-to-1 in the years before 1834. Untilrecently, historians have assumed that the Jacksonians deliber-ately tried to bring in gold and expel silver and establish amonometallic gold standard by the back door. Recent studyhas shown, however, that the Jacksonians only wanted to give84Probably the Jacksonians did so to preserve the illusion that the orig-inal silver dollar, the “dollar of our fathers” and the standard currency ofthe day, remained fixed in value.

Indeed, it turns out that for two decades the Jack-sonians were right, and that the slight 1-percent premium of sil-ver over gold was not enough to drive the former coins out ofcirculation.86Both silver and gold were imported from then on,and silver and gold coins both circulated successfully side byside until the early 1850s. Lightweight Spanish fractional silverremained overvalued even at the mint ratio, so it flourished incirculation, replacing depreciated small notes. Even Americansilver dollars were now retained in circulation since they were“shielded” and kept circulating by the presence of new, heavy-weight Mexican silver dollars, which were exported instead.87In order to stimulate the circulation of both gold and silvercoins instead of paper notes, the Jacksonians also passed twocompanion coinage acts in 1834. The Jacksonians were not mon-etary nationalists; specie was specie, and they saw no reasonthat foreign gold or silver coins should not circulate with thesame full privileges as American-minted coins. Hence, the Jack-sonians, in two separate measures, legalized the circulation of85For the illuminating discovery that the Jacksonians were interestedin purging small bank notes by bringing in gold, see Paul M.

TheJackson administration finally succeeded in getting Congress todo so in 1835 when it set up branch mints to coin gold in NorthCarolina and Georgia, and silver and gold at New Orleans.90Finally, on the federal level, the Jacksonians sought to levy atax on small bank notes and to prevent the federal governmentfrom keeping its deposits in state banks, issuing small notes, oraccepting small bank notes in taxes. They were not successful,but the independent Treasury eliminated public deposit in statebanks and the Specie Circular, as we have seen, stopped thereceipt of bank notes for public land sales. From 1840 on, thehard-money battle would be waged at the state level. In the early 1850s, Gresham’s Law finally caught up with thebimetallist idyll that the Jacksonians had forged in the 1830s,replacing the earlier de facto silver monometallism. The sudden88As Jackson’s Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury explained thepurpose of this broad legalization of foreign coins: “to provide a full sup-ply and variety of coins, instead of bills below five and ten dollars,” forthis would be “particularly conducive to the security of the poor andmiddling classes, who, as they own but little in, and profit but little by,banks, should be subjected to as small risk as practicable by their bills.”Quoted in Martin, “Metallism,” p. 242.89In 1837 another coinage act made a very slight adjustment in themint ratios. In order to raise the alloy composition of gold coins to havethem similar to silver, the definition of the gold dollar was raised slightlyfrom 23.2 grains to 23.22 grains. With the weight of the silver dollarremaining the same, the silver-gold ratio was now very slightly loweredfrom 16.002-to-1 to 15.998-to-1. Further slight adjustments in valuationsof foreign coins in the Coinage Act of 1843 resulted in the undervalua-tion of many foreign coins and their gradual disappearance. The majorones—Spanish fractional silver—continued, however, to circulate widely.Ibid., p. 436.90Ibid., p. 240."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIdiscovery of extensive gold mines in California, Russia, andAustralia greatly increased gold production, reaching a peak inthe early 1850s. From the 1720s through the 1830s, annual worldgold production averaged $12.8 million, never straying very farfrom that norm. Then, world gold production increased to anannual average of $38.2 million in the 1840s, and spurtedupward to a peak of $155 million in 1853. World gold productionthen fell steadily from that peak to an annual average of $139.9million in the 1850s and to $114.7 million from 1876 to 1890. Itwas not to surpass this peak until the 1890s.91The consequence of the burst in gold production was, ofcourse, a fall in the price of gold relative to silver in the worldmarket. The silver-gold ratio declined from 15.97 in January1849 to an average of 15.70 in 1850 to 15.46 in 1851 and to anaverage of 15.32-to-1 in the eight years from 1853 to 1860.92Asa result, the market premium of American silver dollars overgold quickly rose above the 1-percent margin, which was theestimated cost of shipping silver coins abroad. That premium,which had hovered around 1 percent since the mid-1830s, sud-denly rose to 4.5 percent at the beginning of 1851, and afterfalling back to about 2 percent at the turn of 1852, bounced backup and remained at the 4- to 5-percent level. The result was a rapid disappearance of silver from thecountry, the heaviest and therefore most undervalued coinsvanishing first. Spanish-milled dollars, which contained 1 per-cent to 5 percent more silver than American dollars, com-manded a premium of 7 percent and went first. Then went thefull-weight American silver dollars and after that, Americanfractional silver coins, which were commanding a 4-percentpremium by the fall of 1852.

By the beginning of 1851, however, even theseworn foreign silver fractions had gone to a 1-percent premiumand were beginning to go. It was clear that America was undergoing a severe small-coincrisis. Gold coins were flowing into the country, but they weretoo valuable to be technically usable for small-denominationcoins. The Democratic Pierce administration saw with horrormillions of dollars of unauthorized private small notes floodinto circulation in early 1853 for the first time since the 1830s.The Jacksonians were in grave danger of losing the fight forhard-money coinage, at least for the smaller and mediumdenominations. Something had to be done quickly.93The ultimate breakdown of bimetallism had never beenclearer. If bimetallism is not in the long run viable, this leavestwo free-market, hard-money alternatives: (a) silver monomet-allism with the dollar defined as a weight of silver only, andgold circulating freely by weight at freely fluctuating marketrates; or (b) gold monometallism with the dollar defined only asa weight of gold, with silver circulating by weight. Each of theseis an example of what has been called “parallel standards” or“free metallism,” in which two or more metal coins are allowedto fluctuate freely within the same area and exchange at free-market prices. As we have seen, colonial America was an exam-ple of such parallel standards, since foreign gold and silvercoins circulated freely and at fluctuating market prices.9493Martin, “Metallism,” p. 240.94For an account of how parallel standards worked in Europe from themedieval period through the eighteenth century, see Luigi Einaudi, “TheTheory of Imaginary Money from Charlemagne to the FrenchRevolution,” in Enterprise and Secular Change,F. Lane and J. Riemersma,eds. (Homewood, Ill.: Irwin, 1953), pp. 229–61.

Another viablethough inferior solution to the problem of bimetallism was toestablish a monometallic system, either de facto or de jure,withthe other metal circulating in the form of lightweight, and there-fore overvalued, or “token” coinage. Silver monometallism wasimmediately unfeasible since it was rapidly flowing out of thecountry, and because gold, being far more valuable than silver,the government to the Sysiphean labor of readjusting therelations between different coins as the ratio between thedifferent metals changes, or as one or another coin wasdebased. . . . Genoa on the contrary, in conformity with theprinciple of restricting state intervention as much as possibledidnot try to enforce a fixed relation between coins of differentmetals. . . . Basically, the gold coinage of Genoa was notmeant to integrate the silver and bullion coinages but toform an independent system.

While such apure free-market solution seems remote today, the late nineteenth centu-ry saw a series of important international monetary conferences trying tomove toward a universal gold or silver gram, with each national curren-cy beginning as a simple multiple of each other, and eventually onlyunits of weight being used. Before the conferences foundered on thegold-silver problem, such a result was not as remote or utopian as wemight now believe. See the fascinating account of these conferences inHenry B.

The only feasible solution, then, within a monometallicframework, was to make gold the basic standard and let highlyovervalued, essentially token, silver coins function as sub-sidiary small coinage. Certainly if a parallel standard was not tobe adopted, the latter solution would be far better than allow-ing depreciated paper notes to function as small currency. Under pressure of the crisis, Congress decided, in February1853, to keep the de jure bimetallic standard but to adopt a defacto gold monometallic standard, with fractional silver coinscirculating as a deliberately overvalued subsidiary coinage,legal tender up to a maximum of only $5. The fractional silvercoins were debased by 6.91 percent. With silver commandingabout a 4-percent market premium over gold, this meant thatfractional silver was debased 3 percent below gold. At thatdepreciated rate, fractional silver was not overvalued in rela-tion to gold, and remained in circulation. By April, the new sub-sidiary quarter-dollars proved to be popular and by early 1854the problem of the shortage of small coins in America was over. In rejecting proposals either to go over completely to de juregold monometallism or to keep the existing bimetallic system,Congress was choosing a gold standard temporarily, but keepingits options open. The fact that it continued the old full-bodiedsilver dollar, the “dollar of our fathers,” demonstrates that aneventual return to de facto bimetallism was by no means beingruled out—albeit Gresham’s Law could not then maintain theAmerican silver dollar in circulation.96In 1857, an important part of the Jacksonian coinage pro-gram was repealed, as Congress, in an exercise of monetarynationalism, eliminated all legal tender power of foreigncoins.9796For an excellent portrayal of the congressional choice in 1853, seeMartin, “1853,” pp. 825–44.97Only Spanish-American fractional silver coins were to remain legaltender, and they were to be received quickly at government offices and"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIDECENTRALIZEDBANKING FROM THE1830STO THECIVILWARAfter the central bank was eliminated in the 1830s, the battlefor hard money largely shifted to the state governmental arena.During the 1830s, the major thrust was to prohibit the issue ofsmall notes, which was accomplished for notes under five dol-lars in 10 states by 1832, and subsequently, five others restrictedor prohibited such notes.98 The Democratic Party became ardently hard-money in thevarious states after the shock of the financial crisis of 1837 and1839. The Democratic drive was toward the outlawry of all frac-tional reserve bank paper. Battles were fought also, in the late1840s, at constitutional conventions of many states, particularlyin the west. In some western states, the Jacksonians won tem-porary success, but soon the Whigs would return and repeal thebank prohibition. The Whigs, trying to find some way to over-come the general revulsion against banks after the crisis of thelate 1830s, adopted the concept of “free” banking, which hadbeen enacted by New York and Michigan in the late 1830s. FromNew York, the idea spread outward to the rest of the countryand triumphed in 15 states by the early 1850s. On the eve of theCivil War, 18 out of the 33 states in the Union had adopted“free” banking laws.99It must be realized that “free” banking, as it came to beknown in the United States before the Civil War, was unrelatedto the philosophic concept of free banking analyzed by econo-mists. As we have seen earlier, genuine free banking is a systemwhere entry into banking is totally free; the banks are neithersubsidized nor regulated, and at the first sign of failure toimmediately reminted into American coins.

It is true that bankincorporation was now more liberal since any bank that metthe legal regulations could become incorporated automaticallywithout lobbying for special legislative charters, as had beenthe case before. But the banks were now subject to a myriad ofregulations, including edicts by state banking commissionersand high minimum capital requirements that greatly restrictedentry into the banking business. But the most pernicious aspectof “free” banking was that the expansion of bank notes anddeposits was directly tied to the amount of state governmentsecurities that the bank had invested in and posted as bondwith the state. In effect, then, state government bonds becamethe reserve base upon which banks were allowed to pyramid amultiple expansion of bank notes and deposits. Not only didthis system provide explicitly or implicitly for fractionalreserve banking, but the pyramid was tied rigidly to theamount of government bonds purchased by the banks. Thisprovision deliberately tied banks and bank credit expansion tothe public debt; it meant that the more public debt the bankspurchased, the more they could create and lend out newmoney. Banks, in short, were encouraged to monetize the pub-lic debt, state governments were thereby encouraged to go intodebt, and hence, government and bank inflation were inti-mately linked. 100Rockoff goes so far as to call free banking the “antithesis of laissez-fairebanking laws.” Hugh Rockoff, “Varieties of Banking and RegionalEconomic Development in the United States, 1840–1860,” Journal ofEconomic History35 (March 1975): 162.

In addition, state usury laws, pushed by the Whigs andopposed by the Democrats, made credit excessively cheap forthe riskiest borrowers and encouraged inflation and speculativeexpansion of bank lending. Furthermore, the desire of state governments to financeinternal improvements was an important factor in subsidizingand propelling expansion of bank credit.

They arose to meet the credit demands not of farmers[who were too economically astute to accept wildcat money]but of states engaged in public improvements.”101 Despite the flaws and problems, the decentralized nature ofthe pre–Civil War banking system meant banks were free toexperiment on their own with improving the banking system.The most successful such device was the creation of the Suffolksystem. 101Hammond, Banks and Politics, p. 627.

Further, this SuffolkBank restrained the overissuance of these notes. In short, it wasa private central bank that kept the other banks honest. As such,it made New England an island of monetary stability in anAmerica contending with currency chaos. Chaos was, in fact, that condition in which New Englandfound herself just before the Suffolk Bank was established.There was a myriad of bank notes circulating in the area’slargest financial center, Boston. Some were issued by Bostonbanks which all in Boston knew to be solvent. But others wereissued by state-chartered banks. These could be quite far away,and in those days such distance impeded both general knowl-edge about their solvency and easy access in bringing thebanks’ notes in for redemption into gold or silver. Thus, whileat the beginning these country notes were accepted in Boston atpar value, this just encouraged some faraway banks to issue farmore notes than they had gold to back them. So country banknotes began to be generally traded at discounts to par, of from1 percent to 5 percent. City banks finally refused to accept country bank notes alto-gether. This gave rise to the money brokers mentioned earlier inthis chapter. But it also caused hardship for Boston merchants,who had to accept country notes whose real value they couldnot be certain of. When they exchanged the notes with the bro-kers, they ended up assuming the full cost of discounting thebills they had accepted at par. AFALSESTARTMatters began to change in 1814.

The note holders,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIthough, still had to pay the cost. In 1818, a group of prominentmerchants formed the Suffolk Bank to do the same thing. Thisenlarged competition brought the basic rate of country-notediscount down from 3 percent in 1814 to 1 percent in 1818 andfinally to a bare one-half of 1 percent in 1820. But this did notnecessarily mean that country banks were behaving moreresponsibly in their note creation. By the end of 1820 the busi-ness had become clearly unprofitable, and both banks stoppedcompeting with the private money brokers. The Suffolkbecame just another Boston bank. OPERATIONBEGINSDuring the next several years city banks found their notesrepresenting an ever smaller part of the total New Englandmoney supply. Country banks were simply issuing far morenotes in proportion to their capital (that is, gold and silver) thanwere the Boston banks.Concerned about this influx of paper money of lesser worth,both Suffolk Bank and New England Bank began again in 1824to purchase country notes. But this time they did so not to makea profit on redemption, but simply to reduce the number ofcountry notes in circulation in Boston. They had the foolish hopethat this would increase the use of their (better) notes, thusincreasing their own loans and profits. But the more they purchased country notes, the more notesof even worse quality (particularly from faraway Maine banks)would replace them. Buying these latter involved more risk, sothe Suffolk proposed to six other city banks a joint fund to pur-chase and send these notes back to the issuing bank forredemption. These seven banks, known as the AssociatedBanks, raised $300,000 for this purpose. With the Suffolk actingas agent and buying country notes from the other six, opera-tions began March 24, 1824.

Further, it now had the leverage to pressure countrybanks into depositing gold and silver with the Suffolk, to makenote redemption easier.

The Suffolk ground rules from beginning (1825) to end (1858)were as follows: Each country bank had to maintain a perma-nent deposit of specie of at least $2,000 for the smallest bank,plus enough to redeem all its notes that Suffolk received. Thesegold and silver deposits did not have to be at Suffolk, as long asthey were at some place convenient to Suffolk, so that the noteswould not have to be sent home for redemption. But in practice,nearly all reserves were at Suffolk. (City banks had only todeposit a fixed amount, which decreased to $5,000 by 1835.) Nointerest was paid on any of these deposits. But, in exchange, theSuffolk began performing an invaluable service: It agreed toaccept at par all the notes it received as deposits from otherNew England banks in the system, and credit the depositorbanks’ accounts on the following day. With the Suffolk acting as a “clearing bank,” accepting, sort-ing, and crediting bank notes, it was now possible for any NewEngland bank to accept the notes of any other bank, howeverfar away, and at face value. This drastically cut down on thetime and inconvenience of applying to each bank separately forspecie redemption. Moreover, the certainty spread that thenotes of the Suffolk member banks would be valued at par: Itspread at first among other bankers and then to the generalpublic. THECOUNTRYBANKSRESISTHow did the inflationist country banks react to this? Notvery well, for as one could see the Suffolk system put limits onthe amount of notes they could issue. They resented parredemption and detested systematic specie redemptionbecause that forced them to stay honest. But country banksknew that any bank that did not play by the rules would be"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIshunned by the banks that did (or at least see its notes acceptedonly at discount, and not in a very wide area, at that). All legalmeans to stop Suffolk failed: The Massachusetts SupremeCourt upheld in 1827 Suffolk’s right to demand gold or silverfor country bank notes, and the state legislature refused tocharter a clearing bank run by country banks, probably rightlyassuming that these banks would run much less strict opera-tions. Stung by these setbacks, the country banks played by therules, bided their time, and awaited their revenge. SUFFOLK’SSTABILIZINGEFFECTSEven though Suffolk’s initial objective had been to increasethe circulation of city banks, this did not happen. In fact, byhaving their notes redeemed at par, country banks gained anew respectability. This came, naturally, at the expense of thenumber of notes issued by the worst former inflationists. Butat least in Massachusetts, the percentage of city bank notes incirculation fell from 48.5 percent in 1826 to 35.8 percent in1833.CIRCULATION OFNOTES OFMASSACHUSETTSBANKS(INTHOUSANDS) Date All Banks Boston Banks Boston Percentage 1823 $3,129 $1,354 43.3 1824 3,843 1,797 46.8 1825 4,091 1,918 46.9 1826 4,550 2,206 48.5 1827 4,936 2,103 42.6 1828 4,885 2,067 42.3 1829 4,748 2,078 43.8 1830 5,124 2,171 42.3 1831 7,139 3,464 44.8 1832 7,123 3,060 43.0 1833 7,889 2,824 35.8 Source: Wilfred S.

Itaccepted only banks whose notes were sound. While Suffolkcould not prevent a bad bank from inflating, denying it mem-bership ensured that the notes would not enjoy wide circulation.And the member banks that were mismanaged could bestricken from the list of Suffolk-approved New England banksin good standing. This caused an offending bank’s notes totrade at a discount at once, even though the bank itself might bestill redeeming its notes in specie. In another way, Suffolk exercised a stabilizing influence onthe New England economy. It controlled the use of overdrafts inthe system. When a member bank needed money, it could applyfor an overdraft, that is, a portion of the excess reserves in thebanking system. If Suffolk decided that a member bank’s loanpolicy was not conservative enough, it could refuse to sanctionthat bank’s application to borrow reserves at Suffolk. The denialof overdrafts to profligate banks thus forced those banks tokeep their assets more liquid. (Few government central bankstoday have succeeded in that.) This is all the more remarkablewhen one considers that Suffolk—or any central bank—couldhave earned extra interest income by issuing overdrafts irre-sponsibly. But Dr. George Trivoli, whose excellent monograph, The Suf-folk Bank, we rely on in this study, states that by providing sta-bility to the New England banking system, “it should not beinferred that the Suffolk bank was operating purely as publicbenefactor.” Suffolk, in fact, made handsome profits. At its peakin 1858, the last year of existence, it was redeeming $400 millionin notes, with a total annual salary cost of only $40,000. Thehealthy profits were derived primarily from loaning out thosereserve deposits which Suffolk itself, remember, did not payinterest on. These amounted to more than $1 million in 1858.The interest charged on overdrafts augmented that. Not sur-prisingly, Suffolk stock was the highest priced bank stock inBoston, and by 1850, regular dividends were 10 percent."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IITHESUFFOLKDIFFERENCEThat the Suffolk system was able to provide note redemptionmuch more cheaply than the U.S. government was stated by aU.S. comptroller of the currency. John Jay Knox compared thetwo systems from a vantage point of half a century: [I]n 1857 the redemption of notes by the Suffolk Bank wasalmost $400,000,000 as against $137,697,696, in 1875, thehighest amount ever reported under the National bankingsystem. The redemptions in 1898 were only $66,683,476, at acost of $1.29 per thousand. The cost of redemption under theSuffolk system was ten cents per $1,000, which does notappear to include transportation. If this item is deductedfrom the cost of redeeming National bank notes, it wouldreduce it to about ninety-four cents. This difference isaccounted for by the relatively small amount of redemptionsby the Treasury, and the increased expense incident to thenecessity of official checks by the Government, and by thehigher salaries paid. But allowing for these differences, thefact is established that private enterprise could be entrustedwith the work of redeeming the circulating notes of thebanks, and it could thus be done as safely and much moreeconomically than the same service can be performed by theGovernment.102The volume of redemptions was much larger under Suffolkthan under the national banking system. During Suffolk’s exis-tence (1825–57) they averaged $229 million per year. The aver-age of the national system from its start in 1863 to about 1898 isput by Mr. Knox at only $54 million. Further, at its peak in 1858,$400 million was redeemed. But the New England money sup-ply was only $40 million. This meant that, astoundingly, theaverage note was redeemed ten times per year, or once everyfive weeks. 102John Jay Knox, A History of Banking in the United States(New York:Augustus M.

And there is some evidence that NewEngland banks were not as susceptible to disaster during theseveral banking panics during that time. In the panic of 1837,not one Connecticut bank failed, nor did any suspend speciepayments. All remained in the Suffolk system. And when in1857 specie payment was suspended in Maine, all but threebanks remained in business. As the Bank Commission of Mainestated, The Suffolk system, though not recognized in banking law,has proved to be a great safeguard to the public; whateverobjections may exist to the system in theory, its practicaloperation is to keep the circulation of our banks within thebounds of safety. THESUFFOLK’SDEMISEThe extraordinary profits—and power—that the Suffolk hadby 1858 attained spawned competitors. The only one to becomeestablished was the Bank for Mutual Redemption in 1858. Thisbank was partially a response to the somewhat arrogant behav-ior of the Suffolk by this time, after 35 years of unprecedentedsuccess. But further, and more important, the balance of powerin the state legislature had shifted outside of Boston, to thecountry bank areas. The politicians were more amenable to thedesires of the overexpanding country banks. Still, it must besaid that Suffolk acted toward the Bank of Mutual Redemptionwith spite where conciliation would have helped. Trying toforce Mutual Redemption out of business, Suffolk, startingOctober 8, 1858, refused to honor notes of banks havingdeposits in the newcomer. Further, Suffolk in effect threatenedany bank withdrawing deposits from it. But country banks ral-lied to the newcomer, and on October 16, Suffolk announcedthat it would stop clearing any country bank notes, thus becom-ing just another bank."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIOnly the Bank for Mutual Redemption was left, and thoughit soon had half the New England banks as members, it wasmuch more lax toward overissuance by country banks. Perhapsthe Suffolk would have returned amid dissatisfaction with itssuccessor, but in 1861, just over two years after Suffolk stoppedclearing, the Civil War began and all specie payments werestopped. As a final nail in the coffin, the national banking sys-tem Act of 1863 forbade the issuance of any state bank notes,giving a monopoly to the government that has continued eversince. While it lasted, though, the Suffolk banking system showedthat it is possible in a free-market system to have private bankscompeting to establish themselves as efficient, safe, and inex-pensive clearinghouses limiting overissue of paper money. THECIVILWARThe Civil War exerted an even more fateful impact on theAmerican monetary and banking system than had the War of1812. It set the United States, for the first time except for1814–1817, on an irredeemable fiat currency that lasted for twodecades and led to reckless inflation of prices. This “greenback”currency set a momentous precedent for the post-1933 UnitedStates, and even more particularly for the post-1971 experimentin fiat money. Perhaps an even more important consequence of the CivilWar was the permanent change wrought in the Americanbanking system. The federal government in effect outlawed theissue of state bank notes, and created a new, quasi-centralized,fractional reserve national banking system which paved theway for the return of outright central banking in the FederalReserve System. The Civil War, in short, ended the separationof the federal government from banking, and brought the twoinstitutions together in an increasingly close and permanentsymbiosis. In that way, the Republican Party, which inheritedthe Whig admiration for paper money and governmental con-trol and sponsorship of inflationary banking, was able to"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States123Before the Twentieth Centuryimplant the soft-money tradition permanently in the Americansystem. GREENBACKSThe Civil War led to an enormous ballooning of federalexpenditures, which skyrocketed from $66 million in 1861 to$1.30 billion four years later. To pay for these swollen expen-ditures, the Treasury initially attempted, in the fall of 1861, tofloat a massive $150 million bond issue, to be purchased bythe nation’s leading banks. However, Secretary of the Trea-sury Salmon P. Chase, a former Jacksonian, tried to require thebanks to pay for the loan in specie that they did not have. Thismassive pressure on their specie, as well as an increased pub-lic demand for specie due to a well-deserved lack of confi-dence in the banks, brought about a general suspension ofspecie payments a few months later, at the end of December1861. This suspension was followed swiftly by the Treasuryitself, which suspended specie payments on its Treasurynotes. The U.S. government quickly took advantage of being onan inconvertible fiat standard. In the Legal Tender Act of Feb-ruary 1862, Congress authorized the printing of $150 millionin new “United States notes” (soon to be known as “green-backs”) to pay for the growing war deficits. The greenbackswere made legal tender for all debts, public and private,except that the Treasury continued its legal obligation of pay-ing the interest on its outstanding public debt in specie.103The103To be able to keep paying interest in specie, Congress providedthat customs duties, at least, had to be paid in gold or silver.

In creating greenbacks in February, Congress resolved thatthis would be the first and last emergency issue. But printingmoney is a heady wine, and a second $150 million issue wasauthorized in July, and still a third $150 million in early 1863.Greenbacks outstanding reached a peak in 1864 of $415.1 mil-lion. Greenbacks began to depreciate in terms of specie almost assoon as they were issued. In an attempt to drive up the price ofgovernment bonds, Secretary Chase eliminated the convertibil-ity of greenbacks in July 1863, an act that simply drove theirvalue down further. Chase and the Treasury officials, instead ofacknowledging their own premier responsibility for the contin-ued depreciation of the greenbacks, conveniently placed theblame on anonymous “gold speculators.” In March 1863, Chasebegan a determined campaign, which would last until he wasdriven from office, to stop the depreciation by controlling,assaulting, and eventually eliminating the gold market. In earlyMarch, he had Congress to levy a stamp tax on gold sales andto forbid loans on a collateral of coin above its par value. Thisrestriction on the gold market had little effect, and when depre-ciation resumed its march at the end of the year, Chase decidedto de facto repeal the requirement that customs duties be paidin gold. In late March 1864, Chase declared that importerswould be allowed to deposit greenbacks at the Treasury andreceive gold in return at a premium below the market.Importers could then use the gold to pay the customs duties.This was supposed to reduce greatly the necessity for importersto buy gold coin on the market and therefore to reduce thedepreciation. The outcome, however, was that the greenback, at59¢ in gold when Chase began the experiment, had fallen to 57¢by mid-April. Chase was then forced to repeal his customs-duties scheme."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States125Before the Twentieth CenturyWith the failure of this attempt to regulate the gold market,Chase promptly escalated his intervention. In mid-April, hesold the massive amount of $11 million in gold in order todrive down the gold premium of greenbacks. But the impactwas trifling, and the Treasury could not continue this policyindefinitely, because it had to keep enough gold in its vaultsto pay interest on its bonds. At the end of the month, thegreenback was lower than ever, having sunk to below 56¢ ingold. Indefatigably, Chase tried yet again. In mid-May 1864, hesold foreign exchange in London at below-market rates inorder to drive down pounds in relation to dollars, and, morespecifically, to replace some of the U.S. export demand for goldin England. But this, too, was a failure, and Chase ended thisexperiment before the end of the month. Finally, Secretary Chase decided to take off the gloves. Hehad failed to regulate the gold market; he would therefore endthe depreciation of greenbacks by destroying the gold marketcompletely. By mid-June, he had driven through Congress atruly despotic measure to prohibit under pain of severe penal-ties all futures contracts in gold, as well as all sales of gold bya broker outside his own office. The result was disaster. The gold market was in chaos, withwide ranges of prices due to the absence of an organized mar-ket. Businessmen clamored for repeal of the “gold bill,” and,worst of all, the object of the law—to lower the depreciation ofthe paper dollar—had scarcely been achieved. Instead, publicconfidence in the greenback plummeted, and its depreciation interms of gold got far worse. At the beginning of June, the green-back dollar was worth over 52¢ in gold. Apprehensions aboutthe emerging gold bill drove the greenback down slightly to 51¢in mid-June. Then, after the passage of the bill, the greenbackplummeted, hitting 40¢ at the end of the month.

The war against the specu-lators was over.104, 105As soon as greenbacks depreciated to less than 97¢ in gold,fractional silver coins became undervalued and so wereexported to be exchanged for gold. By July 1862, in conse-quence, no coin higher than the copper-nickel penny remainedin circulation. The U.S. government then leaped in to fill the gapwith small tickets, first issuing postage stamps for the purpose,then bits of unglued paper, and finally, after the spring of 1863,fractional paper notes.106A total of $28 million in postage cur-rency and fractional notes had been issued by the middle of1864. Even the nickel-copper pennies began to disappear fromcirculation, as greenbacks depreciated, and the nickel-coppercoins began to move toward being undervalued. The expecta-tion and finally the reality of undervaluation drove the coinsinto hoards and then into exports. Postage and fractional notes104Chase and the administration should have heeded the advice ofRepublican Senator Jacob Collamer of Vermont: “Gold does not fluctuatein price . . . because they gamble in it; but they gamble in it because it fluc-tuates. . . .

Thegreenbacks fell further to 35¢ in mid-July on news of military defeats forthe North. Military victories, and consequently rising prospects of possi-ble future gold redemption of the greenbacks, caused a rise in greenbacksin terms of gold, particularly after the beginning of 1865. At war’s end,the greenback dollar was worth 69¢ in gold. Ibid., pp. 232–38, 423–28.106Some of the greenbacks had been decorated with portraits ofPresident Lincoln ($5) and Secretary Chase ($1).

The swift issuance of legal tendergreenbacks, which the government forced creditors to accept atpar, ensured the continued disappearance of gold from then on.

Used to a currency of gold coin only, with no intrusion ofbank notes, California businessmen took steps to maintain goldcirculation and avoid coerced payment in greenbacks.

Any firms that refused to abide by theagreement would be blacklisted and required to pay gold incash for any goods which they might purchase in the future.

After pas-sage of that law, California businessmen were able to protectthemselves against tenders of greenbacks by inserting gold coinpayment clauses in all their contracts. Would that the otherstates, and even the federal government, had done the same!109Furthermore, the private banks of deposit in California refusedto accept greenbacks on deposit, newspapers used their influ-ence to warn citizens about the dangers of greenbacks, and thestate government refused to accept greenbacks in payment oftaxes.

Oregon deposit banks also refused to accept greenbacks, andthe Oregon legislature followed California a year and a halflater in passing a specific performance law. Oregon, too, refusedto accept greenbacks in taxes and strengthened the law in 1864by requiring that “all taxes levied by state, counties, or munici-pal corporations therein, shall be collected and paid in gold andsilver coin of the United States and not otherwise.”110In the same year, the Oregon Supreme Court followed Cali-fornia in ruling that greenbacks could not constitutionally bereceived in payment of taxes. The banking story during the Civil War is greatly compli-cated by the advent of the national banking system in the latterpart of the war. But it is clear that the state banks, being able tosuspend specie and to pyramid money and credit on top of thefederal greenbacks, profited greatly by being able to expandduring this period. Thus, total state bank notes and depositswere $510 million in 1860, and by 1863 rose to $743 million, anincrease in state bank demand liabilities in those three years of15.2 percent per year.111It is no wonder, then, that contrary to older historical opin-ion, many state banks were enthusiastic about the greenbacks,110Cited in Richard A.

Therewere three alternatives to the issuance of legal tender fiatmoney. (1) The government could have issued paper moneybut not made it legal tender; it would have depreciated evenmore rapidly. At any rate, they would have had quasi–legaltender status by being receivable in federal dues and taxes. (2)It could have increased taxes to pay for the war expenditures.(3) It could have issued bonds and other securities and sold thedebt to banks and non-bank institutions. In fact, the govern-ment employed both the latter alternatives, and after 1863stopped issuing greenbacks and relied on them exclusively,especially a rise in the public debt. The accumulated deficitpiled up during the war was $2.614 billion, of which the print-ing of greenbacks only financed $431.7 million. Of the federaldeficits during the war, greenbacks financed 22.8 percent in fis-cal 1862, 48.5 percent in 1863, 6.3 percent in 1864, and none in1865.115This is particularly striking if we consider that the peak114Ralph Andreano, ed., The Economic Impact of the American Civil War(Cambridge, Mass.: Schenckman, 1961), p. 178.115The Confederacy, on the other hand, financed virtually all of itsexpenditures through mammoth printing of fiat paper, the Southern ver-sion of the greenback.

At leastfor most of the war, they were not willing to take their chancesin the competitive bond market.116THEPUBLICDEBTAND THENATIONALBANKINGSYSTEMThe public debt of the Civil War brought into Americanfinancial history the important advent of one Jay Cooke. TheOhio-born Cooke had joined the moderately successfulPhiladelphia investment banking firm of Clark and Dodge as aclerk at the age of 18. In a few years, Cooke worked himself upto the status of junior partner, and, in 1857, he left the firm tobranch out on his own in canal and railroad promotion andother business ventures. There he doubtless would haveremained, except for the lucky fact that he and his brotherHenry, editor of the leading Republican newspaper in Ohio,2,275 percent per annum. See Eugene M.

At that point, theCookes determined to feather their nest by lobbying to makeSalmon Chase secretary of the Treasury. After heavy lobbyingby the Cookes, the Chase appointment was secured, so JayCooke quickly set up his own investment banking house of JayCooke and Company. Everything was in place; it now remained to seize the oppor-tunity.

It did not take much persuasion,including wining and dining, for Cooke to induce his friendChase to take an unprecedented step in the fall of 1862: grant-ing the House of Cooke a monopoly on the underwriting of thepublic debt. With enormous energy, Cooke hurled himself intothe task of persuading the mass of public to buy U.S. govern-ment bonds. In doing so, Cooke perhaps invented the art ofpublic relations and of mass propaganda; certainly, he did so inthe realm of selling bonds. As Kirkland writes: With characteristic optimism, he [Cooke] flung himself intoa bond crusade. He recruited a small army of 2,500 sub-agents among bankers, insurance men, and communityleaders and kept them inspired and informed by mail and117In Henrietta Larson, Jay Cooke, Private Banker(Cambridge, Mass:Harvard University Press, 1936), p. 103.

And purchase the loans they did, for Cooke’s bond salessoon reached the enormous figure of $1 million to $2 milliondollars a day. Perhaps $2 billion in bonds were bought andunderwritten by Jay Cooke during the war. Cooke lost hismonopoly in 1864, under pressure of rival bankers; but a yearlater he was reappointed to keep that highly lucrative postuntil the House of Cooke crashed in the panic of 1873. In the Civil War, Jay Cooke began as a moderately successfulpromoter; he emerged at war’s end a millionaire, a man whohad spawned the popular motto, “as rich as Jay Cooke.” Surelyhe must have counted the $100,000 he had poured into SalmonChase’s political fortunes by 1864 as one of the most lucrativeinvestments he had ever made. It is not surprising that Jay Cooke acquired enormous polit-ical influence in the Republican administration of the Civil Warand after. Hugh McCulloch, secretary of the Treasury from1865 to 1869, was a close friend of Cooke’s, and when McCul-loch left office he assumed the post as head of Cooke’s Londonoffice. The Cooke brothers were also good friends of GeneralUlysses Grant, so they wielded great influence during the Grantadministration. No sooner had Cooke secured the monopoly of governmentbond underwriting than he teamed up with his associates, Sec-retary of the Treasury Chase and Ohio’s Senator John Sher-man, to drive through a measure which was destined to have farmore fateful effects than greenbacks on the American monetarysystem: the national banking system. The National Banking118Kirkland, Industry, pp. 20–21."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States135Before the Twentieth CenturyActs destroyed the previously decentralized and fairly suc-cessful state banking system, and substituted a new, central-ized, and far more inflationary banking system under theaegis of Washington and a handful of Wall Street banks.Whereas the effects of the greenbacks were finally eliminatedby the resumption of specie payments in 1879, the effects ofthe national banking system are still with us. Not only wasthis system in place until 1913, but it paved the way for theFederal Reserve System by instituting a quasi–central bankingtype of monetary system. The “inner contradictions” of thenational banking system were such that the nation was driveneither to go onward to a frankly central bank or else to scrapcentralized banking altogether and go back to decentralizedstate banking. Given the inner dynamic of state intervention tokeep intensifying, coupled with the almost universal adoptionof statist ideology after the turn of the twentieth century,which course the nation would take was unfortunatelyinevitable. Chase and Sherman drove the new system through undercover of war necessity, but it was designed to alter the bankingsystem permanently. The wartime ground was to set upnational banks, which were so structured as to necessarily pur-chase large amounts of U.S. government bonds. Patterned afterthe “free” banking systems, this tied the nation’s banks withthe federal government and the public debt in a close symbioticrelationship. The Jacksonian embarrassment of the independ-ent Treasury was de facto swept away, and the Treasury wouldnow keep its deposits in a new series of “pets”: the nationalbanks, chartered directly by the federal government. In thisway, the Republican Party was able to use the wartime emer-gency to fulfill the Whig-Republican dream of a federally-con-trolled centralized banking system able to inflate the supply ofmoney and credit in a uniform manner. Meshing with this wasa profound political goal: As Sherman expressly pointed out, avital object of the national banking system was to eradicate the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIembarrassing doctrine of state’s rights and to nationalizeAmerican politics.119As established in the bank acts of 1863 and 1864, the nationalbanking system provided for the chartering of national banksby the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington,D.C. The banks were “free” in that any institution meeting therequirements could obtain a charter, but the requirements wereso high (from $50,000 for rural banks to $200,000 in the biggercities) that small national banks were ruled out, particularly inthe large cities.120The national banking system created three sets of nationalbanks: central reserve city, which was only New York; reservecity, others cities with over 500,000 population; and country,which included all other national banks. Central reserve city banks were required to keep 25 percentof their notes and deposits in reserve of vault cash or “lawfulmoney,” which included gold, silver, and greenbacks. This119In his important work on Northern intellectuals and the Civil War,George Frederickson discusses an influential article by one SamuelFowler written at the end of the war:The Civil War which has changed the current of our ideas,and crowded into a few years the emotions of a lifetime,”Fowler wrote, “has in measure given to the preceding peri-od of our history the character of a remote state of politicalexistence.” Fowler described the way in which the war, atriumph of nationalism and a demonstration of “the univer-sal tendency to combination,” had provided the coup de gracefor the Jefferson philosophy of government with its empha-sis on decentralization and the protection of local and indi-vidual liberties.

Reserve citybanks, on the other hand, were allowed to keep one-half of theirrequired reserves in vault cash, while the other half could bekept as demand deposits (checking deposits) in central reservecity banks. Finally, country banks only had to keep a minimumreserve ratio of 15 percent of their notes and deposits; and only40 percent of these reserves had to be in the form of vault cash.The other 60 percent could be in the form of demand depositseither at reserve city or central reserve city banks. The upshot of this system was to replace the individualizedstructure of the pre–Civil War state banking system by aninverted pyramid of country banks expanding on top of reservecity banks, which in turn expanded on top of New York Citybanks. Before the Civil War, every bank had to keep its ownspecie reserves, and any pyramiding of notes and deposits ontop of that was severely limited by calls for redemption inspecie by other, competing banks as well as by the general pub-lic. But now, reserve city banks could keep half of their reservesas deposits in New York City banks, and country banks couldkeep most of theirs in one or the other, so that as a result, all thenational banks in the country could pyramid in two layers ontop of the relatively small base of reserves in the New Yorkbanks. And furthermore, those reserves could consist of inflatedgreenbacks as well as specie.

Notes or checks on theexpanding bank will go into the coffers of other banks, whichwill call on the expanding bank for redemption. This will putsevere pressure on the expanding bank, which cannot redeemall of its liabilities as it is, and whose reserve ratio has declined,so it will be forced to either contract its loans and liabilities orelse go under. Figure 2 Country Banks Reserve City Banks New York City Banks Reserves: Specie and Greenbacks Figure 2 depicts the inverted pyramid of the national bankingsystem. New York City banks pyramid notes and deposits ontop of specie and greenbacks; reserve city banks pyramid theirnotes and deposits on top of specie, greenbacks, anddeposits atNew York City; and country banks pyramid on top of both. Thismeans that, for example, if New York City banks inflate andexpand their notes and deposits, they will not be checked byother banks calling upon them for redemption. Instead, reservecity banks will be able to expand their own loans and liabilitiesby pyramiding on top of their own increased deposits at NewYork banks. In turn, the country banks will be able to inflatetheir credit by pyramiding on top of their increased deposits atboth reserve city and New York banks. The whole nation is ableto inflate uniformly and relatively unchecked by pyramiding ontop of a few New York City banks. The national banks were not compelled to keep part of theirreserves as deposits in larger banks, but they tended to do so—inthe long run, so that they could expand uniformly on top of the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States139Before the Twentieth Centurylarger banks, and in the short run because of the advantages ofhaving a line of credit with a larger “correspondent” bank aswell as earning interest on demand deposits at that bank.121Let us illustrate in another way how the national bankingsystem pyramided by centralizing reserves. Let us consider thehypothetical balance sheets of the various banks.122Supposethat the country banks begin with $1 million in vault cash astheir reserves. With the national banking system in place, thecountry banks can now deposit three-fifths, or $600,000, of theircash in reserve city banks, in return for interest-paying demanddeposits at those banks. The balance-sheet changes are now as follows:COUNTRYBANKSAssets  Liabilities +Equity Reserves Vault cash –$600,000 Deposits at reserve city banks +$600,000 RESERVECITYBANKSAssets  Liabilities +Equity ReservesVault cash +$600,000 Demand depositsdue country banks +$600,000 121Banks generally paid interest on demand deposits until the practicewas outlawed in 1934.122Adapted from Klein, Money and the Economy, pp. 144–45."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IITotal reserves for the two sets of banks have not changed.But now because the country banks can use as their reservesdeposits in reserve city banks, the same total reserves can beused by the banks to expand far more of their credit. For now$400,000 in cash supports the same total of notes and depositsthat the country banks had previously backed by $1 million,and the reserve city banks can now expand $2.4 million on topof the new $600,000 in cash—or rather, $1.8 million in additionto the $600,000 due to the city banks. In short, country bankreserves have remained the same, but reserve city bank reserveshave increased by $600,000, and they can engage in 4-to-1 pyra-miding of credit on top of that. But that is not all. The reserve city banks can deposit halfof their reserves at the New York banks. When they do that,then the balance sheets of the respective banks change as fol-lows: RESERVECITYBANKSAssets  Liabilities + Equity ReservesVault cash + $300,000Deposits at Demand depositscentral reservedue countrycity banks + $300,000 banks+$600,000CENTRALRESERVECITYBANKSAssets  Liabilities + Equity Reserves Vault cash +$300,000 Demand depositsdue reserve city banks +$300,000"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States141Before the Twentieth CenturyNote that since the reserve city banks are allowed to keephalf of their reserves in the central reserve city banks, the for-mer can still pyramid $2.4 million on top of their new$600,000, and yet deposit $300,000 in cash at the New Yorkbanks. The latter, then, can expand another 4-to-1 on top of thenew cash of $300,000, or increase their total notes and depositsto $1.2 million. In short, not only did the national banking system allowpyramiding of the entire banking structure on top of a fewlarge Wall Street banks, but the very initiating of the systemallowed a multiple expansion of all bank liabilities by central-izing a large part of the nation’s cash reserves from the indi-vidual state banks into the hands of the larger, and especiallythe New York, banks. For the expansion of $1.2 million on topof the new $300,000 at New York banks served to expand theliabilities going to the smaller banks, which in turn couldpyramid on top of their increased deposits. But even withoutthat further expansion, $1 million which, we will assume,originally supported $6 million in notes and deposits, willnow support, in addition to that $6 million, $2.4 million issuedby the reserve city banks, and $1.2 million by the New Yorkbanks—to say nothing of further expansion by the latter twosets of banks which will allow country banks to pyramid moreliabilities. In June 1874, the fundamental structure of the national bank-ing system was changed when Congress, as part of an infla-tionist move after the panic of 1873, eliminated all reserverequirements on notes, keeping them only on deposits. Thisreleased over $20 million of lawful money from bank reservesand allowed a further pyramiding of demand liabilities.123Inthe long run, it severed the treatment of notes from deposits,with notes tied rigidly to bank holdings of government debt,and demand deposits pyramiding on top of reserve ratios inspecie and greenbacks. 123See Hepburn, History of Currency, pp. 317–18."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIBut this centralized inverse pyramiding of bank credit was notall. For, in a way modeled by the “free” banking system, everynational bank’s expansion of notes was tied intimately to its own-ership of U.S. government bonds. Every bank could only issuenotes if it deposited an equivalent of U.S. securities as collateral atthe U.S. Treasury,124so that national banks could only expandtheir notes to the extent that they purchased U.S. governmentbonds. This provision tied the national banking system intimatelyto the federal government, and more particularly, to its expansionof public debt. The federal government had an assured, built-inmarket for its debt, and the more the banks purchased that debt,the more the banking system could inflate. Monetizing the publicdebt was not only inflationary per se, it provided thebasis—when done by the larger city banks—of other banks pyra-miding on top of their own monetary expansion. The tie-in and the pyramiding process were cemented byseveral other provisions. Every national bank was obliged toredeem the obligations of every other national bank at par.Thus, the severe market limitation on the circulation ofinflated notes and deposits—depreciation as the distancefrom the bank increases—was abolished. And while the fed-eral government could not exactly make the notes of a privatebank legal tender, it conferred quasi–legal tender status onevery national bank by agreeing to receive all its notes anddeposits at par for dues and taxes.125 It is interesting and evenheartening to discover that despite these enormous advan-tages conferred by the federal government, national banknotes fell below par with greenbacks in the financial crisis of1867, and a number of national banks failed the next year.126124Originally, national banks could only issue notes to the value 90percent of their U.S. government bonds. This limitation was changed to100 percent in 1900.125Except, of course, as we have seen with the greenbacks, for pay-ment of customs duties, which had to be paid in gold, to build up a fundto pay interest on the government debt in gold. 126See Smith, Rationale, p. 48."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States143Before the Twentieth CenturyGenuine redeemability, furthermore, was made very difficultunder the national banking system. Laxity was ensured by thefact that national banks were required to redeem the notes anddeposits of every other national bank at par, and yet it wasmade difficult for them to actually redeem those liabilities inspecie; for one of the problems with the pre–Civil War statebanking system was that interstate or even intrastate brancheswere illegal, thereby hobbling the clearing system for swiftlyredeeming another bank’s notes and deposits. One might thinkthat a national banking system would at least eliminate thisproblem, but on the contrary, branch banking continued to beprohibited, and interstate branch banking is illegal to this day.*A bank would only have to redeem its notes at its own counterin its home office. Furthermore, the redemption of notes wascrippled by the fact that the federal government imposed amaximum limit of $3 million a month by which national banknotes could be contracted.127Reserve requirements are now considered a sound and pre-cise way to limit bank credit expansion, but the precision canwork two ways. Just as government safety codes can decreasesafety by setting a lower limit for safety measures and inducingprivate firms to reduce safety downwardto that common level, soreserve requirements can and ordinarily do serve as lowest com-mon denominators for bank reserve ratios. Free competition canand generally will result in banks voluntarily keeping higherreserve ratios. But a uniform legal requirement will tend topush all the banks down to that minimum ratio. And indeed wecan see this now in the universal propensity of all banks to be“fully loaned up,” that is, to expand as much as is legally pos-sible up to the limits imposed by the legal reserve ratio.

The national banking system was intended to replace thestate banks, but many state banks continued aloof and refusedto join, despite the special privileges accorded to the nationalbanks. The reserve and capital requirements were more oner-ous, and at that period, national banks were prohibited frommaking loans on real estate. With the state banks refusing tocome to heel voluntarily, Congress, in March 1865, completedthe Civil War revolution of the banking system by placing a pro-hibitive 10-percent tax on all bank notes—which had thedesired effect of virtually outlawing all note issues by the statebanks. From 1865 on, the national banks had a legal monopolyon the issue of bank notes. At first, the state banks contracted and disappeared underthe shock, and it looked as if the United States would only havenational banks. The number of state banks fell from 1,466 in1863 to 297 in 1866, and total notes and deposits in state banksfell from $733 million in 1863 to only $101 million in 1866. Afterseveral years, however, the state banks readily took their placeas an expanding element in the banking system, albeit subordi-nated to the national banks. In order to survive, the state bankshad to keep deposit accounts at national banks, from whomthey could “buy” national bank notes in order to redeem theirdeposits. In short, the state banks now became the fourth layerof the national pyramid of money and credit, on top of the coun-try and other banks, for the reserves of the state banks became, inaddition to vault cash, demand deposits at national banks, whichthey could redeem in cash. The multi-layered structure of bankinflation under the national banking system was intensified. In this new structure, the state banks began to flourish. By1873, the total number of state banks had increased to 1,330, andtheir total deposits were $789 million.128128Historical Statistics, pp. 628–29."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States145Before the Twentieth CenturyThe Cooke-Chase connection with the new national bankingsystem was simple. As secretary of the Treasury, Chase wantedan assured market for the government bonds that were beingissued so heavily during the Civil War. And as the monopolyunderwriter of U.S. government bonds for every year exceptone from 1862 to 1873, Jay Cooke was even more directly inter-ested in an assured and expanding market for his bonds. Whatbetter method of obtaining such a market than creating anentirely new banking system, the expansion of which wasdirectly tied to the banks’ purchases of government bonds—from Jay Cooke? The Cooke brothers played a major role in driving theNational Banking Act of 1863 through a reluctant Congress. TheDemocrats, devoted to hard money, opposed the legislationalmost to a man. Only a majority of Republicans could beinduced to agree on the bill. After John Sherman’s decisivespeech in the Senate for the measure, Henry Cooke—now headof the Washington office of the House of Cooke—wrote jubi-lantly to his brother: It will be a great triumph, Jay, and one to which we havecontributed more than any other living man. The bank hadbeen repudiated by the House, and was without a sponsorin the Senate, and was thus virtually dead and buried whenI induced Sherman to take hold of it, and we went to workwith the newspapers.129Going to work with the newspapers meant something morethan mere persuasion for the Cooke brothers; as monopolyunderwriter of government bonds, Cooke was paying thenewspapers large sums for advertising, and so the Cookesthought—as it turned out correctly—that they could induce thenewspapers to grant them an enormous amount of free space“in which to set forth the merits of the new national banking129Quoted in Robert P. Sharkey, Money, Class, and Party: An EconomicStudy of Civil War and Reconstruction(Baltimore, Md.: The Johns HopkinsPress, 1959), p. 245."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIsystem.” Such space meant not only publicity and articles, buteven more important, the fervent editorial support of most ofthe nation’s press. And so the press, implicitly bought for theoccasion, kept up a drumfire of propaganda for the newnational banking system. As Cooke himself related: For six weeks or more nearly all the newspapers in the coun-try were filled with our editorials [written by the Cookebrothers] condemning the state bank system and explainingthe great benefits to be derived from the national bankingsystem now proposed. And every day the indefatigable Cookes put on the desks ofevery member of Congress the relevant editorials from news-papers in their respective districts.130While many state bankers, especially the conservative old-line New York bankers, opposed the national banking system,Jay Cooke, once the system was in place, plunged in with a will.Not only did he sell the national banks their required bonds, healso set up new national banks which would have to buy hisgovernment securities. His agents formed national banks in thesmaller towns of the south and west. Furthermore, he set uptwo large national banks, the First National Bank of Philadel-phia and the First National Bank of Washington, D.C. But the national banking system was in great need of amighty bank in New York City to serve as the base of the infla-tionary pyramid for a host of country and reserve city banks.Shortly after the inception of the system, three national bankshad been organized in New York, but none of them were largeenough or prestigious enough to serve as the key fulcrum of thenew banking structure. Jay Cooke, however, was happy tooblige, and he quickly established the Fourth National Bank ofNew York, capitalized at a huge $5 million. After the war, JayCooke favored resumption of specie payments, but only ifgreenbacks could be replaced one-to-one by new nationalbank notes. In his unbounded enthusiasm for national bank130See Hammond, Sovereignty, pp. 289–90."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States147Before the Twentieth Centurynotes and their dependence on the federal debt, Cooke urgedrepeal of the $300 million legal limit on national bank noteissue. In 1865, he published a pamphlet proclaiming that inless than 20 years national bank note circulation would total$1 billion.131The title of the pamphlet Cooke published is revealing: HowOur National Debt May Be A National Blessing. The Debt is PublicWealth, Political Union, Protection of Industry, Secure Basis forNational Currency.132By 1866, it was clear that the national banking system hadreplaced the state as the center of the monetary system of theUnited States. Only a year earlier, in 1865, state bank notes hadtotaled $142.9 million; by 1866 they had collapsed to $20 mil-lion. On the one hand, national bank notes grew from a mere$31.2 million in 1864, their first year of existence, to $276 millionin 1866. And while, as we have seen, the number of state banksin existence was falling drastically from 1,466 to 297, the num-ber of national banks grew in that same period, from 66 in 1863to 1,634 three years later. THEPOST–CIVILWARERA: 1865–1879 The United States ended the war with a depreciated incon-vertible greenback currency, and a heavy burden of public debt.The first question on the monetary agenda was what to do aboutthe greenbacks. A powerful group of industrialists calling forcontinuation of greenbacks, opposing resumption and, of course,any contraction of money to prepare for specie resumption, washeaded by the Pennsylvania iron and steel manufacturers. ThePennsylvania ironmasters, who had been in the forefront of theorganized protective tariff movement since its beginnings in131Actually, Cooke erred, and national bank notes never reached thattotal. Instead, it was demand deposits that expanded, and reached thebillion-dollar mark by 1879.132See Sharkey, Money, Class, and Party, p. 247."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II1820,133were led here and instructed by their intellectual men-tor—himself a Pennsylvania ironmaster—the elderly economistHenry C. Carey. Carey and his fellow iron manufacturers real-ized that during an inflation, since the foreign exchange marketanticipates further inflation, domestic currency tends to depre-ciate faster than domestic prices are rising. A falling dollar anda rising price of gold, they realized, make domestic pricescheaper and imported prices higher, and hence function as asurrogate tariff. A cheap-money, inflationist policy, then, couldnot only provide easy credit for manufacturing, it could alsofunction as an extra tariff because of the depreciation of the dol-lar and the rise in the gold premium. Imbibers of the Carey gospel of high tariffs and soft moneywere a host of attendees at the famous “Carey Vespers”—evenings of discussion of economics and politics. InfluentialCarey disciples included economist and Pennsylvania ironmas-ter Stephen Colwell; Eber Ward, president of the Iron and SteelAssociation; John A.

Smith Homans, Jr., editor of The Bankers Maga-zine; and powerful U.S. Representative William D.

Influential allies in Congress, if not preciselyCarey followers, were the radical leader Representative Thad-deus Stevens, himself a Pennsylvania ironmaster, and Repre-sentative John A. Griswold, an ironmaster from New York. Also sympathetic to greenbacks were many manufacturerswho desired cheap credit, gold speculators who were betting on133The leader of the protectionists in Congress in 1820 wasRepresentative Henry Baldwin, a leading iron manufacturer fromPittsburgh.

In 1874, Schell became a member of Congress, where heproposed an outrageous pre-Keynesian scheme in the spirit ofKeynes’s later dictum that so long as money is spent, it doesn’tmatter what the money is spent on, be it pyramid-building ordigging holes in the ground.135Schell seriously urged the fed-eral government to dig a canal from New York to San Francisco,financed wholly by the issue of greenbacks. Schell’s enthusiasmwas perhaps matched only by that of the notorious railroadspeculator and economic adventurer George Francis Train, whocalled repeatedly for immense issues of greenbacks.

Pendleton of Ohio, began to agitate for further issueof greenbacks solelyfor the purpose of redeeming the principalof federal debts contracted in greenbacks during the war.138In asense, then, hard-money hostility to both inflation and the pub-lic debt were now at odds. In a sense, the Pendletonians weremotivated by a sense of poetic justice, of paying inflated debtsin inflated paper, but in doing so they lost sight of the broaderhard-money goal.139This program confused the party struggles136Unger, Greenback Era, p. 46.137Ibid., p. 222.138The federal government had contracted to redeem the interestonthe wartime public debt in gold, but nothing was contracted about therepayment of the principal.139Similar motivations had impelled many hard-money anti-Federalists during the 1780s to advocate the issue of state paper moneyfor the solepurpose of redeeming swollen wartime public debts."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States151Before the Twentieth Centuryof the post–Civil War period, but ultimately it is safe to say thatthe Democrats had a far greater proportion of congressmendevoted to hard money and to resumption than did theRepublicans. Thus, Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCul-loch’s “Loan Bill” of March 1866, which provided for contrac-tion of greenbacks in preparation for resumption of specie pay-ments, was passed in the House by a Republican vote of 56–52,and a Democratic vote of 27–1.

Finally, however, the Democratic sweep in the congres-sional elections of 1874 forced the Republicans into a semblanceof unity on monetary matters, and, in the lame-duck congres-sional session led by Senator John Sherman, they came up withthe Resumption Act of January 1875. Despite the fact that the Resumption Act ultimately resulted inspecie resumption, it was not considered a hard-money victoryby contemporaries. Sherman had forged a compromise betweenhard- and soft-money forces. It is true that the U.S. governmentwas supposed to buy gold with government bonds to prepare forresumption on January 1, 1879.

Hard-money forces throughout the country had an equally scornfulview of the Resumption Act. In a few years, however, they ralliedas resumption drew near.That the Republicans were generally less than enthusiasticabout specie resumption was revealed by the Grant administra-tion’s reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision in the first legaltender case. After the end of the war, the question of the consti-tutionality of legal tender came before the courts (we have seenthat the California and Oregon courts decided irredeemablepaper to be unconstitutional). In the large number of state courtdecisions on greenbacks before 1870, every Republican judgebut one upheld their constitutionality, whereas every Democra-tic judge but two declared them unconstitutional.142The greenback question reached the U.S. Supreme Court in1867, and was decided in February 1870, in the case of Hepburn v.Griswold. The Court held, by a vote of 5–3, with all the Democra-tic judges voting with the majority and the Republicans in theminority. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, who delivered the deci-sion denouncing his own action as secretary of the Treaury asunnecessary and unconstitutional, had swung back to the Demo-cratic Party and had actually been a candidate for the presiden-tial nomination at the 1868 convention. 141This political and compromise interpretation of the ResumptionAct successfully revises the previous hard-money view of this measure.See Unger, Greenback Era, pp. 249–63.142See Charles Fairman, “Mr. Justice Bradley’s Appointment to theSupreme Court and the Legal Tender Cases,” Harvard Law Review(May1941): 1131; cited in Unger, Greenback Era, p. 174."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States153Before the Twentieth CenturyThe Grant administration was upset by Hepburn v.

As luck would have it, however, there were two vacan-cies on the Court, one of which was created by the retirementof one of the majority judges. Grant appointed not only twoRepublican judges, but two railroad lawyers whose views onthe subject were already known.143The new 5–4 majority duti-fully and quickly reconsidered the question, and, in May 1871,reversed the previous Court in the fateful decision of Knox v.Lee. From then on, paper money would be held consonantwith the U.S. Constitution. The national banking system was ensconced after the CivilWar.

These panics were triggered by the currencydrains that took place in periods of relative prosperity whenbanks were loaned up.144And yet it must be pointed out that the total money supply,even merely the supply of bank money, did not decrease afterthe panic, but merely leveled off. Orthodox economic historians have long complained aboutthe “great depression” that is supposed to have struck theUnited States in the panic of 1873 and lasted for an unprece-dented six years, until 1879. Much of this stagnation is sup-posed to have been caused by a monetary contraction leading tothe resumption of specie payments in 1879. Yet what sort of“depression” is it which saw an extraordinarily large expansionof industry, of railroads, of physical output, of net nationalproduct, or real per capita income? As Friedman and Schwartzadmit, the decade from 1869 to 1879 saw a 3-percent-per-annum increase in money national product, an outstandingreal national product growth of 6.8 percent per year in thisperiod, and a phenomenal rise of 4.5 percent per year in realproduct per capita.

From 1873 through 1878, beforeanother spurt of monetary expansion, the total supply of bankmoney rosefrom $1.964 billion to $2.221 billion—a rise of 13.1percent or 2.6 percent per year. In short, a modest but definiterise, and scarcely a contraction. It should be clear, then, that the “great depression” of the 1870sis merely a myth—a myth brought about by misinterpretation of144Klein, Money and the Economy,pp. 145–46."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States155Before the Twentieth Centurythe fact that prices in general fell sharply during the entireperiod. Indeed they fell from the end of the Civil War until 1879.Friedman and Schwartz estimated that prices in general fellfrom 1869 to 1879 by 3.8 percent per annum. Unfortunately,most historians and economists are conditioned to believe thatsteadily and sharply falling prices mustresult in depression:hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economicgrowth during this era. For they have overlooked the fact thatin the natural course of events, when government and the bank-ing system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, free-market capitalism will result in an increase of production andeconomic growth so great as to swamp the increase of moneysupply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depres-sion or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too)economic growth, and the spread of the increased living stan-dard to all the consumers.145Indeed, recent research has discovered that the analogous“great depression” in England in this period was also a myth,and due to a confusion between a contraction of prices and itsalleged inevitable effect on a depression of prices and its allegedinevitable effect on a depression of business activity.146It might well be that the major effect of the panic of 1873was, not to initiate a great depression, but to cause bankrupt-cies in overinflated banks and in railroads riding on the tide ofvast government subsidy and bank speculation. In particular,we may note Jay Cooke, one of the creators of the nationalbanking system and paladin of the public debt. In 1866, hefavored contraction of the greenbacks and early resumption145For the bemusement of Friedman and Schwartz, see MiltonFriedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, A Monetary History of theUnited States, 1867–1960(New York: National Bureau of EconomicResearch, 1963), pp. 33–44.

By the late 1860s, however, the House ofCooke was expanding everywhere, and in particular, had got-ten control of the new Northern Pacific Railroad. NorthernPacific had been the recipient of the biggest federal largesse torailroads during the 1860s: a land grant of no less than 47 mil-lion acres. Cooke sold Northern Pacific bonds as he had learned to sellgovernment securities: hiring pamphleteers to write propa-ganda about the alleged Mediterranean climate of the North-west. Many leading government officials and politicians wereon the Cooke–Northern Pacific payroll, including PresidentGrant’s private secretary, General Horace Porter. In 1869, Cooke expressed his monetary philosophy in keep-ing with his enlarged sphere of activity: Why should this Grand and Glorious Country be stuntedand dwarfed—its activities chilled and its very life bloodcurdled by these miserable “hard coin” theories—the mustytheories of a by gone age—These men who are urging onpremature resumption know nothing of the great growingwest which would grow twice as fast if it was not crampedfor the means necessary to build RailRoads and improvefarms and convey the produce to market. But in 1873, a remarkable example of poetic justice struck JayCooke. The overbuilt Northern Pacific was crumbling, and aCooke government bond operation provided a failure. So themighty House of Cooke—”stunted and dwarfed” by the marketeconomy—crashed and went bankrupt, touching off the panicof 1873.147After passing the Resumption Act in 1875, the Republicansfinally stumbled their way into resumption in 1879, fully 14years after the end of the Civil War.

Return to the gold standard in 1879 was almost blocked, inthe last three years before resumption, by the emergence of atremendous agitation, heavily in the West but also throughoutthe country, for the free coinage of silver. The United States mintratios had been undervaluing silver since 1834, and in 1853 defacto gold monometallism was established because silver wasso far undervalued as to drive fractional silver coins out of thecountry. Since 1853, the United States, while de jure on abimetallic standard at 16-to-1, with the silver dollar still techni-cally in circulation though nonexistent, was actually on a goldmonometallic standard with lightweight subsidiary silver coinsfor fractional use.In 1872, it became apparent to a few knowledgeable men atthe U.S. Treasury that silver, which had held at about 15.5-to-1since the early 1860s, was about to suffer a huge decline invalue. The major reason was the realization that Europeannations were shifting from a silver to a gold standard, therebydecreasing their demand for silver. A subsidiary reason was thediscovery of silver mines in Nevada and other states in theWest. Working rapidly, these Treasury men, along with SenatorSherman, slipped through Congress in February 1873 a seem-ingly innocuous bill which in effect discontinued the mintingof any further silver dollars. This was followed by an act ofJune 1874, which completed the demonetization of silver byending the legal tender quality of all silver dollars above thesum of $5. The timing was perfect, since it was in 1874 that themarket value of silver fell to greater than 16-to-1 to gold for thefirst time. From then on, the market price of silver fell steadily,declining to nearly 18-to-1 in 1876, over 18-to-1 in 1879, andreaching the phenomenal level of 32-to-1 in 1894.

The champions ofgreenbacks, the champions of inflation, saw a “hard-money”way to increase greatly the amount of American currency: theremonetization of a flood of new overvalued silver. The agita-tion was to remonetize silver by “the free and unlimitedcoinage of silver at 16-to-1.” It should be recognized that the silverites had a case. Thedemonetization of silver was a “crime” in the sense that it wasdone shiftily, deceptively, by men who knew that they wantedto demonetize silver before it was too late and have silverreplace gold. The case for gold over silver was a strong one, par-ticularly in an era of rapidly falling value of silver, but it shouldhave been made openly and honestly. The furtive method ofdemonetizing silver, the “crime against silver,” was in partresponsible for the vehemence of the silver agitation for theremainder of the century.148Ultimately, the administration was able to secure theresumption of payments in gold, but at the expense of submit-ting to the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which mandated that theTreasury purchase $2 million to $4 million of silver per monthfrom then on. It should be noted that this first silver agitation of the late1870s, at least, cannot be considered an “agrarian” or a partic-ularly Southern and Western movement. The silver agitationwas broadly based throughout the nation, except in New Eng-land, and was, moreover, an urban movement. As Weinsteinpoints out: 148For the best discussion of the crime against silver, see AllenWeinstein, Prelude to Populism: Origins of the Silver Issue, 1867–1878 (NewHaven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1970), pp. 8–32.

The first batch ofbimetallist leaders were a loosely knit collection of hardmoney newspaper editors, businessmen, academic reform-ers, bankers, and commercial groups.149With the passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1878, silveragitation died out in America, to spring up again in the 1890s.THEGOLDSTANDARDERAWITH THENATIONALBANKINGSYSTEM, 1879–1913 The record of 1879–1896 was very similar to the first stage ofthe alleged great depression from 1873 to 1879. Once again, wehad a phenomenal expansion of American industry, produc-tion, and real output per head. Real reproducible, tangiblewealth per capita rose at the decadal peak in American historyin the 1880s, at 3.8 percent per annum. Real net national prod-uct rose at the rate of 3.7 percent per year from 1879 to 1897,while per-capita net national product increased by 1.5 percentper year. Once again, orthodox economic historians are bewildered,for there should have been a great depression, since prices fellat a rate of over 1 percent per year in this period. Just as in theprevious period, the money supply grew, but not fast enough toovercome the great increases in productivity and the supply ofproducts. The major difference in the two periods is that moneysupply rose more rapidly from 1879 to 1897, by 6 percent peryear, compared with the 2.7 percent per year in the earlier era.As a result, prices fell by less, by over 1 percent per annum ascontrasted to 3.8 percent. Total bank money, notes, and depositsrose from $2.45 billion to $6.06 billion in this period, a rise of149Weinstein, Prelude to Populism, p. 356."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"160A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II10.45 percent per annum—surely enough to satisfy all but themost ardent inflationists.150For those who persist in associating a gold standard withdeflation, it should be pointed out that price deflation in thegold standard 1879–1897 period was considerably less thanprice deflation from 1873 to 1879, when the United States wasstill on a fiat greenback standard. After specie resumption occurred successfully in 1879, thegold premium to greenbacks fell to par and the appreciatedgreenback promoted confidence in the gold-backed dollar.More foreigners willing to hold dollars meant an inflow of goldinto the United States and greater American exports. Some his-torians have attributed the boom of 1879–1882, culminating ina financial crisis in the latter year, to the inflow of gold coin tothe U.S., which rose from $110.5 million in 1879 to $358.3 mil-lion in 1882.151In a sense this is true, but the boom would neverhave taken on considerable proportions without the pyramid-ing of the national banking system, the deposits of whichincreased from $2.149 billion in 1879 to $2.777 billion in 1882, arise of 29.2 percent, or 9.7 percent per annum. Wholesale priceswere driven up from 90 in 1879 to 108 three years later, a 22.5percent increase, before resuming their long-run downwardpath. A financial panic in 1884, coming during a mild contractionafter 1882, lowered the supply of bank money. Total bank notesand deposits dropped slightly, from $3.19 billion in 1883 to $3.15billion. The panic was triggered by an overflow of gold abroad,as foreigners began to lose confidence in the willingness of theUnited States to remain on the gold standard. This understand-able loss of confidence resulted from the inflationary sop to thepro-silver forces in the Bland-Allison Silver Purchase Act of150Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History,pp. 91–93; and HistoricalStatistics, p. 625.151Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History, pp. 98–99."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States161Before the Twentieth Century1878. The shift in Treasury balances from gold to silver struck adisquieting note in foreign financial circles.152Before examining the critical decade of the 1890s, it is well topoint out in some detail the excellent record of the first decadeafter the return to gold, 1879–1889. America went off the gold standard in 1861 and remained offafter the war’s end. Arguments between hard-money advocateswho wanted to eliminate unbacked greenbacks and soft-moneymen who wanted to increase them raged through the 1870s untilthe Grant administration decided in 1875 to resume redemptionof paper dollars into gold at prewar value on the first day of1879. At the time (1875) greenbacks were trading at a discount ofroughly 17 percent against the prewar gold dollar. A combina-tion of outright paper-money deflation and an increase in officialgold holdings enabled a return to gold four years later, which setthe scene for a decade of tremendous economic growth. Economic recordkeeping a century ago was not nearly as welldeveloped as today, but a clear picture comes through nonethe-less. TheEncyclopedia of American Economic Historycalls theperiod under review “one of the most expansive in Americanhistory. Capital investment was high; . . . there was little unem-ployment; and the real costs of production declined rapidly.” PRICES, WAGES, ANDREALWAGESThis is shown most graphically with a look at wages andprices during the decade before and after convertibility.While prices fell during the 1870s and 1880s, wages only fellduring the greenback period, and rose from 1879 to 1889. The figures tell a remarkable story. Both consumer pricesand nominal wages fell by about 30 percent during the lastdecade of greenbacks. But from 1879–1889, while prices keptfalling, wages rose 23 percent. So real wages, after taking infla-tion—or the lack of it—into effect, soared. 152See Rendigs Fels, American Business Cycle, 1865–1897(Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press, 1959), pp. 130–31."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"162A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIWHOLESALEPRICEINDEX(1910–1914 = 100)YearIndex% Change1869  151—187990-40.4%188981-10.0%CONSUMERPRICEINDEX1869138—187997-28.8%188993-4.2%WAGES(1900–1914 = 100)Urban Labor Farm Labor Combined1869 77  96  871879 61  61  611889 72  78  75No decade before or since produced such a sustainable risein real wages.

Indeed all during thistime there was never a completely free-market monetary sys-tem. The National Banking Acts of 1863–1864 had semi-cartelized the banking system.Only certain banks could issue money, but all other bankshad to have accounts at these. The financial panics throughoutthe late nineteenth century were a result of the arbitrary credit-creation powers of the banking system. While not as harmful astoday’s inflation mechanism, it was still a storm in an otherwisefairly healthy economic climate. The fateful decade of the 1890s saw the return of the agitationfor free silver, which had lain dormant for a decade. The Repub-lican Party intensified its longtime flirtation with inflation bypassing the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which roughlydoubled the Treasury purchase requirement of silver. The Trea-sury was now mandated to buy 4.5 million ounces of silver permonth. Furthermore, payment was to be made in a new issue ofredeemable greenback currency, Treasury notes of 1890, whichwere to be a full legal tender, redeemable in either gold or silverat the discretion of the Treasury. Not only was this an increasedcommitment to silver, it was a significant step on the road tobimetallism which—at the depreciated market rates—wouldmean inflationary silver monometallism. In the same year, theRepublicans passed the high McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, whichreaffirmed their commitment to high tariffs and soft money. Another unsettling inflationary move made in the same yearwas that the New York Subtreasury altered its longstanding prac-tice of settling its clearinghouse balances in gold coin. Instead, inAugust 1890, it began using the old greenbacks and the newTreasury notes of 1890. As a result, these paper currencies largelyreplaced gold paid in customs receipts in New York.153153See Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History, pp. 106, n. 25."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIUneasiness about the shift from gold to silver and the con-tinuing free-silver agitation caused foreigners to lose furtherconfidence in the U.S. gold standard, and to cause a drop in cap-ital imports and severe gold outflows from the country. Thisloss of confidence exerted contractionist pressure on the Amer-ican economy and reduced potential economic growth duringthe early 1890s. Fears about the American gold standard were intensified inMarch 1891, when the Treasury suddenly imposed a stiff fee onthe export of gold bars taken from its vaults so that most goldexported from then on was American gold coin rather thanbars. A shock went through the financial community, in theU.S. and abroad, when the United States Senate passed a free-silver coinage bill in July 1892; the fact that the bill went no fur-ther was not enough to restore confidence in the gold standard.Banks began to insert clauses in loans and mortgages requiringpayment in gold coin; clearly the dollar was no longer trusted.Gold exports intensified in 1892, the Treasury’s gold reservedeclined, and a run ensued on the U.S. Treasury. In February1893, the Treasury persuaded New York banks, which haddrawn down $6 million on gold from the Treasury by present-ing Treasury notes for redemption, to return the gold and reac-quire the paper. This act of desperation was scarcely calculatedto restore confidence in the paper dollar. The Treasury waspaying the price for specie resumption without bothering tocontract the paper notes in circulation. The gold standard wastherefore inherently shaky, resting only on public confidence,and that was giving way under the silver agitation and underdesperate acts by the Treasury. Poor Grover Cleveland, a hard-money Democrat, assumedthe presidency in the middle of this monetary crisis. Twomonths later, the stock market collapsed, and a month after-ward, in June 1893, distrust of the fractional reserve banks ledto massive bank runs and bank failures throughout the country.Once again, however, many banks, national and state, espe-cially in the West and South, were allowed to suspend speciepayments.

Thetotal money supply—gold coin, Treasury paper, national banknotes, and national and state bank deposits—fell by 6.3 percentin one year, from June 1892 to June 1893. Suspension of speciepayments resulted in deposits—which were no longer immedi-ately redeemable in cash—going to a discount in relation to cur-rency during the month of August. As a result, deposits becameless useful, and the public tried its best to intensify its exchangeof deposits for currency. By the end of 1893, the panic was over as foreign confidencerose with the Cleveland administration’s successful repeal of theSherman Silver Purchase Act in November of that year. Furthersilver agitation of 1895 endangered the Treasury’s gold reserve,but heroic acts of the Treasury, including buying gold from a syn-dicate of bankers headed by J.P. Morgan and August Belmont,restored confidence in the continuance of the gold standard.154The victory of the free-silver Bryanite forces at the 1896 Democ-ratic convention caused further problems for gold, but the vic-tory of the pro-gold Republicans put an end to the problem ofdomestic and foreign confidence in the gold standard.1896: THETRANSFORMATIONOF THEAMERICANPARTYSYSTEMOrthodox economic historians attribute the triumph ofWilliam Jennings Bryan in the Democratic Convention of 1896,and his later renominations for president, to a righteous risingup of the “people” demanding inflation over the “interests”holding out for gold. Friedman and Schwartz attribute the riseof Bryanism to the price contraction of the last three decades ofthe nineteenth century, and the triumph of gold and disappear-ance of the “money” issue to the price rise after 1896.155154On silver agitation, the gold reserves, and the panic of 1893, seeFriedman and Schwartz, Monetary History, pp. 104–33, 705.155Ibid.,Monetary History, pp. 113–19."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"170A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIThis conventional analysis overlooks several problems. First,if Bryan represented the “people” versus the “interests,” whydid Bryan lose and lose soundly, not once but three times? Whydid gold triumph long before any price inflation became obvi-ous, in fact at the depths of price contraction in 1896? But the main neglect of the conventional analysis is the dis-regard of the highly illuminating insights provided in the pastfifteen years by the “new political history” of nineteenth-cen-tury American politics and its political culture. The new politi-cal history began by going beyond national political issues(largely economic) and investigating state and local politicalcontests.156It also dug into the actual voting records of individ-ual parishes, wards, and counties, and discovered how peoplevoted and why they voted the way they did.

Democrats), lastingfrom about 1832 to 1854, was succeeded by the third system(Republicans v. Democrats), lasting from 1854 to 1896. Characteristic of both party systems was that each partywas committed to a distinctive ideology clashing with theother, and these conflicting worldviews made for fierce andclose contests. Elections were particularly hard fought. Interestwas high since the parties offered a “choice, not an echo,” andso the turnout rate was remarkably high, often reaching 80 to90 percent of eligible voters. More remarkably, candidates didnot, as we are used to in the twentieth century, fuzz their ide-ology during campaigns in order to appeal to a floating, ideo-logically indifferent, “independent voter.” There were veryfew independent voters. The way to win elections, therefore,was to bring out your vote, and the way to do that was tointensify and strengthen your ideology during campaigns.Any fuzzing over would lead the Republican or Democraticconstituents to stay home in disgust, and the election would belost. Very rarely would there be a crossover to the other, hatedparty. One problem that strikes anyone interested in nineteenth-century political history is: How come the average personexhibited such great and intense interest in such arcane eco-nomic topics as banking, gold and silver, and tariffs? Thou-sands of half-literate people wrote embattled tracts on thesetopics, and voters were intensely interested. Attributing theanswer to inflation or depression, to seemingly economic inter-ests, as do Marxists and other economic determinists, simplywon’t do. The far greater depressions and inflations of thetwentieth century have not educed nearly as much mass inter-est in economics as did the milder economic crises of the pastcentury."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIOnly the findings of the new political historians havecleared up this puzzle. It turns out that the mass of the publicwas not necessarily interested in what the elites, or nationalpoliticians, were talking about. The most intense and directinterest of the voters was applied to local and state issues, andon these local levels the two parties waged an intense andfurious political struggle that lasted from the 1830s to the1890s. The beginning of the century-long struggle began with theprofound transformation of American Protestantism in the1830s. This transformation swept like wildfire across theNorthern states, particularly Yankee territory, during the 1830s,leaving the South virtually untouched. The transformationfound particular root among Yankee culture, with its aggres-sive and domineering spirit.157This new Protestantism—called “pietism”—was born in thefires of Charles Finney and the great revival movement of the1830s. Its credo was roughly as follows: Each individual isresponsible for his own salvation, and it must come in an emo-tional moment of being “born again.” Each person can achievesalvation; each person must do his best to save everyone else.This compulsion to save others was more than simple mission-ary work; it meant that one would go to hell unless he did hisbest to save others. But since each person is alone and facing thetemptation to sin, this role can only be done by the use of theState. The role of the State was to stamp out sin and create a newJerusalem on Earth.158, 159157”Yankees” originated in rural New England and then emigratedwestward in the early nineteenth century, settling in upstate (particularlywestern) New York, northern Ohio, northern Indiana, and northernIllinois.158These pietists have been called “evangelical pietists” to contrastthem with the new Southern pietists, called “salvational pietists,” whodid not include the compulsion to save everyone else in their doctrine.159These pietists are distinguished from contemporary “fundamental-ists” because the former were “postmillennialists” who believe that the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States173Before the Twentieth CenturyThe pietists defined sin very broadly. In particular, the mostimportant politically was “demon rum,” which clouded men’sminds and therefore robbed them of their theological free will.In the 1830s, the evangelical pietists launched a determinedand indefatigable prohibitionist crusade on the state and locallevel that lasted a century. Second was any activity on Sundayexcept going to church, which led to a drive for Sabbatarianblue laws. Drinking on Sunday was of course a double sin, andhence was particularly heinous. Another vital thrust of the newYankee pietism was to try to extirpate Roman Catholicism,which robs communicants of their theological free will by sub-jecting them to the dictates of priests who are agents of the Vat-ican. If Roman Catholics could not be prohibited per se, theirimmigration could be slowed down or stopped. And since theiradults were irrevocably steeped in sin, it became vital for cru-sading pietists to try to establish public schools as compulsoryforces for Protestantizing society or, as the pietists liked to putit, to “Christianize the Catholics.” If the adults are hopeless, thechildren must be saved by the public school and compulsoryattendance laws. Such was the political program of Yankee pietism. Not all immi-grants were scorned. British, Norwegian, or other immigrantswho belonged to pietist churches (whether nominally Calvinistor Lutheran or not) were welcomed as “true Americans.” TheNorthern pietists found their home, almost to a man, first in theWhig Party, and then in the Republican Party. And they did so,too, among the Greenback and Populist parties, as we shall seefurther below. world must be shaped up and Christianized for a millennium beforeJesus will return. In contrast, contemporary fundamentalists are “pre-millennials” who believe that the Second Coming of Jesus will usher inthe millennium. Obviously, if everyone must be shaped up before Jesuscan return, there is a much greater incentive to wield State power tostamp out sin."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIThere came to this country during the century an increasingnumber of Catholic and Lutheran immigrants, especially fromIreland and Germany. The Catholics and High Lutherans, whohave been called “ritualists” or “liturgicals,” had a very differ-ent kind of religious culture. Each person is not responsible forhis own salvation directly; if he is to be saved, he joins thechurch and obeys its liturgy and sacraments. In a profoundsense, then, the church is responsible for one’s salvation, andthere was no need for the State to stamp out temptation. Thesechurches, then, especially the Lutheran, had a laissez-faire atti-tude toward the State and morality. Furthermore, their defini-tions of “sin” were not nearly as broad as the pietists’. Liquor isfine in moderation; and drinking beer with the family in beerparlors on Sunday after church was a cherished German(Catholic and Lutheran) tradition; and parochial schools werevital in transmitting religious values to their children in a coun-try where they were in a minority. Virtually to a man, Catholics and High Lutherans160foundtheir home during the nineteenth century in the DemocraticParty. It is no wonder that the Republicans gloried in callingthemselves throughout this period “the party of great moralideas,” while the Democrats declared themselves to be “theparty of personal liberty.” For nearly a century, the bemusedliturgical Democrats fought a defensive struggle against peoplewhom they considered “pietist-fanatics” constantly swoopingdown trying to outlaw their liquor, their Sunday beer parlors,and their parochial schools. How did all this relate to the economic issues of the day?Simply that the leaders of each party went to their voting con-stituents and “raised their consciousness” to get them vitally160Lutherans, then as now, were split into many different synods,some highly liturgical, others highly pietist, and still others in between.Paul Kleppner has shown a 1-to-1 correlation between the degree of litur-gicalness and the percentage of Democratic Party votes among the differ-ent synods."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"A History of Money and Banking in the United States175Before the Twentieth Centuryinterested in national economic questions. Thus, the Republi-can leaders would go to their rank and file and say: “Just as weneed Big Paternalistic Government on the local and state levelto stamp out sin and compel morality, so we need Big Govern-ment on the national level to increase everyone’s purchasingpower through inflation, keeping out cheap foreign goods (tar-iffs), or keeping out cheap foreign labor (immigration restric-tions).”And for their part, the Democratic leaders would go to theirconstituents and say: “Just as the Republican fanatics are tryingto take away your liquor, your beer parlors, and your parochialschools, so the same people are trying to keep out cheap foreigngoods (tariffs), and trying to destroy the value of your savingsthrough inflation. Paternalistic government on the federal levelis just as evil as it is at home.”So statism and libertarianism were expanded to other issuesand other levels. Each side infused its economic issues with amoral fervor and passion stemming from deeply held religiousvalues. The mystery of the passionate interest of Americans ineconomic issues in the epoch is solved. Both in the second and third party systems, however, theWhigs and then the Republicans had a grave problem. Partlybecause of demographics—greater immigration and higherbirth rates—the Democratic-liturgicals were slowly but surelybecoming the majority party in the country. The Democratswere split asunder by the slavery question in the 1840s and ‘50s.But now, by 1890, the Republicans saw the handwriting on thewall. The Democratic victory in the congressional races in 1890,followed by the unprecedented landslide victory of GroverCleveland carrying bothhouses of Congress in 1892, indicatedto the Republicans that they were becoming doomed to be apermanent minority. To remedy the problem, the Republicans, in the early 1890s,led by Ohio Republicans William McKinley and Mark Hanna,launched a shrewd campaign of reconstruction.

Also, they modified theirhostility to immigration. By the mid-1890s, the Republicans hadmoved rapidly toward the center, toward fuzzing over theirpolitical pietism. In the meanwhile, an upheaval was beginning to occur inthe Democratic Party. The South, by now a one-party Democ-ratic region, was having its own pietism transformed by the1890s. Quiet pietists were now becoming evangelical, andSouthern Protestant organizations began to call for prohibition.Then the new, sparsely settled Mountain states, many of themwith silver mines, were also largely pietist. Moreover, a powervacuum, which would ordinarily have been temporary, hadbeen created in the national Democratic Party. Poor GroverCleveland, a hard-money laissez-faire Democrat, was blamedfor the panic of 1893, and many leading Cleveland Democratslost their gubernatorial and senatorial posts in the 1894 elec-tions. The Cleveland Democrats were temporarily weak, andthe Southern-Mountain coalition was ready to hand. Seeingthis opportunity, William Jennings Bryan and his pietist coali-tion seized control of the Democratic Party at the momentousconvention of 1896. The Democratic Party was never to be thesame again.161The Catholics, Lutherans, and laissez-faire ClevelandDemocrats were in mortal shock. The “party of our fathers”was lost. The Republicans, who had been moderating theirstance anyway, saw the opportunity of a lifetime. At theRepublican convention, Representative Henry Cabot Lodge,representing the Morgans and the pro-gold-standard Bostonfinancial interests, told McKinley and Hanna: Pledge yourselfto the gold standard—the basic Cleveland economicissue—and drop your silverite and greenback tendencies, and161Grover Cleveland himself, of course, was neither a Roman Catholicnor a Lutheran.

Refuse, and we will support Bryan or athird party. McKinley struck the deal, and from then on, theRepublicans, in nineteenth-century terms, were a centrist party.Their principles were now high tariffs and the gold standard,and prohibition was quietly forgotten. What would the poor liturgicals do? Many of them stayedhome in droves, and indeed the election of 1896 marks thebeginning of the great slide downward in voter turnout ratesthat continues to the present day. Some of them, in anguish atthe pietist, inflationist, and prohibitionist Bryanites, actuallyconquered their anguish and voted Republican for the first timein their lives. The Republicans, after all, had dropped the hatedprohibitionists and adopted gold. The election of 1896 inaugurated the fourth party system inAmerica. From a third party system of closely fought, seesaw-ing races between a pietist-statist Republican Party vs. a liturgi-cal-libertarian Democratic Party, the fourth party system con-sisted of a majority centrist Republican Party as against aminority pietist Democratic Party. After a few years, the Democ-rats lost their pietist nature, and they too became a centrist,though usually minority party, with a moderately statist ideol-ogy scarcely distinguishable from the Republicans. So went thefourth party system until 1932. A charming anecdote, told us by Richard Jensen, sums upmuch of the 1896 election. The heavily German city of Milwau-kee had been mainly Democratic for years. The German Luther-ans and Catholics in America were devoted, in particular, to thegold standard and were bitter enemies of inflation. The Demo-cratic nomination for Congress in Milwaukee had beenobtained by a Populist-Democrat, Richard Schilling. Soundingfor all the world like modern monetarists or Keynesians,Schilling tried to explain to the assembled Germans of Milwau-kee in a campaign speech that it didn’t really matter what com-modity was chosen as money, that “gold, silver, copper, paper,sauerkraut or sausages” would do equally well as money. Atthat point, the German masses of Milwaukee laughed Schilling"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"178A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIoff the stage, and the shrewdly opportunistic Republicansadopted as their campaign slogan, “Schilling and Sauerkraut”and swept Milwaukee. 162The Greenbackers and later the pro-silver, inflationist, Bryan-ite Populist Party were not “agrarian parties”; they were collec-tions of pietists aiming to stamp out personal and political sin.Thus, as Kleppner points out, “The Greenback Party was less anamalgamation of economic pressure groups than an ad hoccoalition of ‘True Believers,’ ‘ideologues,’ who launched theirparty as a ‘quasi-religious’ movement that bore the indeliblehallmark of ‘a transfiguring faith.’ ” The Greenbackers per-ceived their movement as the “religion of the Master in motionamong men.” And the Populists described their 1890 free-silvercontest in Kansas not as a “political campaign,” but as “a reli-gious revival, a crusade, a pentecost of politics in which atongue of flame sat upon every man, and each spake as thespirit gave him utterance.” The people had “heard the wordand could preach the gospel of Populism.” It was no accident,we see now, that the Greenbackers almost invariably endorsedprohibition, compulsory public schooling, and crushing ofparochial schools. Or that Populists in many states “declaredunequivocally for prohibition” or entered various forms offusion with the Prohibition Party.163The Transformation of 1896 and the death of the third partysystem meant the end of America’s great laissez-faire, hard-money libertarian party. The Democratic Party was no longerthe party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland. With no furtherpolitical embodiment for laissez-faire in existence, and withboth parties offering “an echo not a choice,” public interest in162So intense was the German-American devotion to gold and hardmoney that even German communist-anarchist Johann Most, leader of amovement that sought the abolition of money itself, actually came out forthe gold standard during the 1896 campaign!

In con-trast, what actually happened was that business became increas-ingly competitive during the late nineteenth century, and thatvarious big-business interests, led by the powerful financialhouse of J.P. Morgan and Company, had tried desperately to183[Originally published as “The Origins of the Federal Reserve,” QuarterlyJournal of Austrian Economics2, no. 3 (Fall): 3–51.—Ed.]"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIestablish successful cartels on the free market. The first wave ofsuch cartels was in the first large-scale business, railroads, andin every case, the attempt to increase profits, by cutting saleswith a quota system and thereby to raise prices or rates, col-lapsed quickly from internal competition within the cartel andfrom external competition by new competitors eager to under-cut the cartel. During the 1890s, in the new field of large-scaleindustrial corporations, big-business interests tried to establishhigh prices and reduced production via mergers, and again, inevery case, the mergers collapsed from the winds of new com-petition. In both sets of cartel attempts, J.P. Morgan and Com-pany had taken the lead, and in both sets of cases, the market,hampered though it was by high protective tariff walls, man-aged to nullify these attempts at voluntary cartelization.It then became clear to these big-business interests that theonly way to establish a cartelized economy, an economy thatwould ensure their continued economic dominance and highprofits, would be to use the powers of government to establishand maintain cartels by coercion. In other words, to transformthe economy from roughly laissez-faire to centralized and coor-dinated statism. But how could the American people, steeped ina long tradition of fierce opposition to government-imposedmonopoly, go along with this program? How could the public’sconsent to the New Order be engineered?Fortunately for the cartelists, a solution to this vexing problemlay at hand. Monopoly could be put over in the name of oppositionto monopoly! In that way, using the rhetoric beloved by Ameri-cans, the formof the political economy could be maintained, whilethe contentcould be totally reversed. Monopoly had always beendefined, in the popular parlance and among economists, as“grants of exclusive privilege” by the government. It was nowsimply redefined as “big business” or business competitive prac-tices, such as price-cutting, so that regulatory commissions, fromthe Interstate Commerce Commission to the Federal Trade Com-mission to state insurance commissions, were lobbied for andstaffed by big-business men from the regulated industry, all done"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve185in the name of curbing “big business monopoly” on the free mar-ket. In that way, the regulatory commissions could subsidize,restrict, and cartelize in the name of “opposing monopoly,” aswell as promoting the general welfare and national security. Onceagain, it was railroad monopoly that paved the way.For this intellectual shell game, the cartelists needed the sup-port of the nation’s intellectuals, the class of professional opinion-molders in society. The Morgans needed a smoke screen of ideol-ogy, setting forth the rationale and the apologetics for the NewOrder. Again, fortunately for them, the intellectuals were readyand eager for the new alliance. The enormous growth of intellec-tuals, academics, social scientists, technocrats, engineers, socialworkers, physicians, and occupational “guilds” of all types in thelate nineteenth century led most of these groups to organize for afar greater share of the pie than they could possibly achieve onthe free market. These intellectuals needed the State to license,restrict, and cartelize their occupations, so as to raise the incomesfor the fortunate people already in these fields. In return for theirserving as apologists for the new statism, the State was preparedto offer not only cartelized occupations, but also ever increasingand cushier jobs in the bureaucracy to plan and propagandize forthe newly statized society. And the intellectuals were ready for it,having learned in graduate schools in Germany the glories of sta-tism and organicist socialism, of a harmonious “middle way”between dog-eat-dog laissez-faire on the one hand and proletar-ian Marxism on the other. Instead, big government, staffed byintellectuals and technocrats, steered by big business and aidedby unions organizing a subservient labor force, would impose acooperative commonwealth for the alleged benefit of all.UNHAPPINESSWITHTHENATIONALBANKINGSYSTEMThe previous big push for statism in America had occurredduring the Civil War, when the virtual one-party Congress aftersecession of the South emboldened the Republicans to enact theircherished statist program under cover of the war. The alliance of"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"big business and big government with the Republican Partydrove through an income tax, heavy excise taxes on such sinfulproducts as tobacco and alcohol, high protective tariffs, andhuge land grants and other subsidies to transcontinental rail-roads. The overbuilding of railroads led directly to Morgan’sfailed attempts at railroad pools, and finally to the creation, pro-moted by Morgan and Morgan-controlled railroads, of the Inter-state Commerce Commission in 1887. The result of thatwas thelong secular decline of the railroads beginning before 1900. Theincome tax was annulled by Supreme Court action, but wasreinstated during the Progressive period.The most interventionary of the Civil War actions was in thevital field of money and banking. The approach toward hardmoney and free banking that had been achieved during the 1840sand 1850s was swept away by two pernicious inflationist mea-sures of the wartime Republican administration. One was fiatmoney greenbacks, which depreciated by half by the middle ofthe Civil War, and were finally replaced by the gold standard afterurgent pressure by hard-money Democrats, but not until 1879,some 14 full years after the end of the war. A second, and morelasting, intervention was the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864,and 1865, which destroyed the issue of bank notes by state-char-tered (or “state”) banks by a prohibitory tax, and then monopo-lized the issue of bank notes in the hands of a few large, federallychartered “national banks,” mainly centered on Wall Street. In atypical cartelization, national banks were compelled by law toaccept each other’s notes and demand deposits at par, negatingthe process by which the free market had previously been dis-counting the notes and deposits of shaky and inflationary banks.In this way, the Wall Street–federal government establish-ment was able to control the banking system, and inflate thesupply of notes and deposits in a coordinated manner.But there were still problems. The national banking systemprovided only a halfway house between free banking and gov-ernment central banking, and by the end of the nineteenth cen-tury, the Wall Street banks were becoming increasingly unhappy186A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"with the status quo. The centralization was only limited, and,above all, there was no governmental central bank to coordinateinflation, and to act as a lender of last resort, bailing out banksin trouble. No sooner had bank credit generated booms whenthey got into trouble and bank-created booms turned into reces-sions, with banks forced to contract their loans and assets and todeflate in order to save themselves. Not only that, but after theinitial shock of the National Banking Acts, state banks hadgrown rapidly by pyramiding their loans and demand depositson top of national bank notes. These state banks, free of the highlegal capital requirements that kept entry restricted in nationalbanking, flourished during the 1880s and 1890s and providedstiff competition for the national banks themselves. Further-more, St. Louis and Chicago, after the 1880s, provided increas-ingly severe competition to Wall Street. Thus, St. Louis andChicago bank deposits, which had been only 16 percent of theSt. Louis, Chicago, and New York City total in 1880, rose to 33percent of that total by 1912. All in all, bank clearings outside ofNew York City, which were 24 percent of the national total in1882, had risen to 43 percent by 1913.The complaints of the big banks were summed up in oneword: “inelasticity.” The national banking system, they charged,did not provide for the proper “elasticity” of the money supply;that is, the banks were not able to expand money and credit asmuch as they wished, particularly in times of recession. In short,the national banking system did not provide sufficient room forinflationary expansions of credit by the nation’s banks.1The Origins of the Federal Reserve1871On the national banking system background and on the increasingunhappiness of the big banks, see Murray N.

Eventhough the eventual major role in forming and dominating theFederal Reserve System was taken by the Morgans, the Rocke-feller and Kuhn, Loeb forces were equally enthusiastic in push-ing, and collaborating on, what they all considered to be anessential monetary reform.THEBEGINNINGS OF THE“REFORM” MOVEMENT:THEINDIANAPOLISMONETARYCONVENTIONThe presidential election of 1896 was a great national referen-dum on the gold standard. The Democratic Party had been cap-tured, at its 1896 convention, by the Populist, ultra-inflationist,anti-gold forces, headed by William Jennings Bryan. The olderDemocrats, who had been fiercely devoted to hard money andthe gold standard, either stayed home on election day or voted,for the first time in their lives, for the hated Republicans. TheRepublicans had long been the party of prohibition and of green-back inflation and opposition to gold. But since the early 1890s,188A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II2Indeed, much of the political history of the United States from thelate nineteenth century until World War II may be interpreted by thecloseness of each administration to one of these sometimes cooperating,more often conflicting, financial groupings: Cleveland (Morgan), McKinley(Rockefeller), Theodore Roosevelt (Morgan), Taft (Rockefeller), Wilson(Morgan), Harding (Rockefeller), Coolidge (Morgan), Hoover (Morgan),and Franklin Roosevelt (Harriman–Kuhn, Loeb–Rockefeller)."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the Rockefeller forces, dominant in their home state of Ohio andnationally in the Republican Party, had decided to quietly ditchprohibition as a political embarrassment and as a grave deterrentto obtaining votes from the increasingly powerful bloc of Ger-man-American voters. In the summer of 1896, anticipating thedefeat of the gold forces at the Democratic convention, the Mor-gans, previously dominant in the Democratic Party, approachedthe McKinley–Mark Hanna–Rockefeller forces through their ris-ing young satrap, Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge of Massa-chusetts. Lodge offered the Rockefeller forces a deal: The Mor-gans would support McKinley for president and neither sit homenor back a third, Gold Democrat party, provided that McKinleypledged himself to a gold standard. The deal was struck, andmany previously hard-money Democrats shifted to the Republi-cans. The nature of the American political party system was nowdrastically changed: previously a tightly fought strugglebetween hard-money, free-trade, laissez-faire Democrats on theone hand, and protectionist, inflationist, and statist Republicanson the other, with the Democrats slowly but surely gainingascendancy by the early 1890s, was now a party system thatwould be dominated by the Republicans until the depressionelection of 1932.The Morgans were strongly opposed to Bryanism, which wasnot only Populist and inflationist, but also anti–Wall Street bank;the Bryanites, much like Populists of the present day, preferredcongressional, greenback inflationism to the more subtle, andmore privileged, big-bank-controlled variety. The Morgans, incontrast, favored a gold standard. But, once gold was secured bythe McKinley victory of 1896, they wanted to press on to use thegold standard as a hard-money camouflage behind which theycould change the system into one less nakedly inflationist thanpopulism but far more effectively controlled by the big-bankerelites. In the long run, a controlled Morgan-Rockefeller goldstandard was far more pernicious to the cause of genuine hardmoney than a candid free-silver or greenback Bryanism.As soon as McKinley was safely elected, the Morgan-Rocke-feller forces began to organize a “reform” movement to cure theThe Origins of the Federal Reserve189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II“inelasticity” of money in the existing gold standard and tomove slowly toward the establishment of a central bank. To doso, they decided to use the techniques they had successfullyemployed in establishing a pro–gold standard movement dur-ing 1895 and 1896. The crucial point was to avoid the publicsuspicion of Wall Street and banker control by acquiring thepatina of a broad-based grassroots movement. To do so, themovement was deliberately focused in the Middle West, theheartland of America, and organizations developed thatincluded not only bankers, but also businessmen, economists,and other academics, who supplied respectability, persuasive-ness, and technical expertise to the reform cause.Accordingly, the reform drive began just after the 1896 elec-tions in authentic Midwest country. Hugh Henry Hanna, presi-dent of the Atlas Engine Works of Indianapolis, who had learnedorganizing tactics during the year with the pro–gold standardUnion for Sound Money, sent a memorandum, in November, tothe Indianapolis Board of Trade, urging a grassroots Midwesternstate like Indiana to take the lead in currency reform.3In response, the reformers moved fast. Answering the call ofthe Indianapolis Board of Trade, delegates from boards oftrade from 12 Midwestern cities met in Indianapolis onDecember 1, 1896. The conference called for a large monetaryconvention of businessmen, which accordingly met in Indi-anapolis on January 12, 1897. Representatives from 26 states andthe District of Columbia were present. The monetary reformmovement was now officially under way. The influential YaleReviewcommended the convention for averting the danger ofarousing popular hostility to bankers. It reported that “the con-ference was a gathering of businessmen in general rather thanbankers in particular.”43For the memorandum, see James Livingston, Origins of the FederalReserve System: Money, Class, and Corporate Capitalism, 1890–1913 (Ithaca,N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 104–05.4Yale Review5 (1897): 343–45, quoted in ibid., p. 105."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve191The conventioneers may have been businessmen, but theywere certainly not very grassrootsy.

Payne and George Foster Peabody. Henry Payne wasa Republican Party leader from Milwaukee and president of theMorgan-dominated Wisconsin Telephone Company, long asso-ciated with the railroad-oriented Spooner-Sawyer Republicanmachine in Wisconsin politics. Payne was also heavily involvedin Milwaukee utility and banking interests, in particular as alongtime director of the North American Company, a large pub-lic utility holding company headed by New York City financierCharles W. Wetmore. So close was North American to the Mor-gan interests that its board included two top Morgan financiers.One was Edmund C. Converse, president of Morgan-run Lib-erty National Bank of New York City, and soon-to-be foundingpresident of Morgan’s Bankers Trust Company. The other wasRobert Bacon, a partner in J.P. Morgan and Company, and one ofTheodore Roosevelt’s closest friends, whom Roosevelt wouldmake assistant secretary of state. Furthermore, when TheodoreRoosevelt became president as the result of the assassination ofWilliam McKinley, he replaced Rockefeller’s top political opera-tive, Mark Hanna of Ohio, with Henry C. Payne as postmastergeneral of the United States. Payne, a leading Morgan lieu-tenant, was reportedly appointed to what was then the majorpolitical post in the Cabinet, specifically to break Hanna’s holdover the national Republican Party. It seems clear that replacingHanna with Payne was part of the savage assault that TheodoreRoosevelt would soon launch against Standard Oil as part of theopen warfare about to break out between the Rockefeller–Harri-man–Kuhn, Loeb camp and the Morgan camp.5Even more powerful in the Morgan ambit was the secretary ofthe Indianapolis Monetary Convention’s executive committee,5See Philip H.

The entire Peabody family of BostonBrahmins had long been personally and financially closelyassociated with the Morgans. A member of the Peabody clanhad even served as best man at J.P. Morgan’s wedding in 1865.George Peabody had long ago established an internationalbanking firm of which J.P. Morgan’s father, Junius, had beenone of the senior partners. George Foster Peabody was aneminent New York investment banker with extensive holdingsin Mexico, who was to help reorganize General Electric for theMorgans, and was later offered the job of secretary of the Trea-sury during the Wilson administration. He would functionthroughout that administration as a “statesman without portfo-lio.”6Let the masses be hoodwinked into regarding the Indianapo-lis Monetary Convention as a spontaneous grassroots outpour-ing of small Midwestern businessmen. To the cognoscenti, anyorganization featuring Henry Payne, Alexander Orr, and espe-cially George Foster Peabody meant but one thing: J.P. Morgan.The Indianapolis Monetary Convention quickly resolved tourge President McKinley to (1) continue the gold standard, and(2) create a new system of “elastic” bank credit. To that end, theconvention urged the president to appoint a new monetarycommission to prepare legislation for a new revised monetarysystem. McKinley was very much in favor of the proposal, sig-naling Rockefeller agreement, and on July 24 he sent a messageto Congress urging the creation of a special monetary commis-sion. The bill for a national monetary commission passed theHouse of Representatives but died in the Senate.7Disappointed but intrepid, the executive committee, failing apresidentially appointed commission, decided in August 1897to go ahead and select its own. The leading role in appointingthis commission was played by George Foster Peabody, who6Ibid., pp. 231, 233.

To select the commission mem-bers, Peabody arranged for the executive committee to meet inthe Saratoga Springs summer home of his investment bankingpartner, Spencer Trask. By September, the executive committeehad selected the members of the Indianapolis Monetary Com-mission.The members of the new Indianapolis Monetary Commissionwere as follows:8Chairman was former Senator George F.

Robert S. Taylor was an Indiana patent attorney for the Mor-gan-controlled General Electric Company.The single most important working member of the commis-sion was James Laurence Laughlin, head professor of politicaleconomy at the new Rockefeller-founded University of Chicagoand editor of its prestigious Journal of Political Economy.It wasLaughlin who supervised the operations of the commission’sstaff and the writing of the reports. Indeed, the two staff assis-tants to the commission who wrote reports were both studentsof Laughlin’s at Chicago: former student L. Carroll Root, and hiscurrent graduate student Henry Parker Willis.The impressive sum of $50,000 was raised throughout thenation’s banking and corporate community to finance the workof the Indianapolis Monetary Commission. New York City’slarge quota was raised by Morgan bankers Peabody and Orr,and heavy contributions to fill the quota came promptly frommining magnate William E. Dodge; cotton and coffee traderHenry Hentz, a director of the Mechanics National Bank; andJ.P. Morgan himself.With the money in hand, the executive committee rented officespace in Washington, D.C., in mid-September, and set the staff tosending out and collating the replies to a detailed monetary ques-tionnaire, sent to several hundred selected experts. The monetarycommission sat from late September into December 1897, siftingthrough the replies to the questionnaire collated by Root andWillis. The purpose of the questionnaire was to mobilize a broadbase of support for the commission’s recommendations, whichthey could claim represented hundreds of expert views. Second,the questionnaire served as an important public relations device,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"196A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IImaking the commission and its work highly visible to the public,to the business community throughout the country, and to mem-bers of Congress. Furthermore, through this device, the com-mission could be seen as speaking for the business communitythroughout the country.To this end, the original idea was to publish the IndianapolisMonetary Commission’s preliminary report, adopted in mid-December, as well as the questionnaire replies in a companionvolume. Plans for the questionnaire volume fell through,although it was later published as part of a series of publicationson political economy and public law by the University of Penn-sylvania.9Undaunted by the slight setback, the executive committeedeveloped new methods of molding public opinion using thequestionnaire replies as an organizing tool. In November, HughHanna hired as his Washington assistant financial journalistCharles A. Conant, whose task was to propagandize and orga-nize public opinion for the recommendations of the commis-sion. The campaign to beat the drums for the forthcoming com-mission report was launched when Conant published an articlein the December 1 issue of Sound Currencymagazine, taking anadvanced line on the report, and bolstering the conclusions notonly with his own knowledge of monetary and banking history,but also with frequent statements from the as-yet-unpublishedreplies to the staff questionnaire.Over the next several months, Conant worked closely withJules Guthridge, the general secretary of the commission; theyfirst induced newspapers throughout the country to printabstracts of the questionnaire replies. As Guthridge wrote somecommission members, he thereby stimulated “public curiosity”about the forthcoming report, and he boasted that by “carefulmanipulation” he was able to get the preliminary report“printed in whole or in part—principally in part—in nearly9See Livingston, Origins, pp. 107–08."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve1977,500 newspapers, large and small.” In the meanwhile,Guthridge and Conant orchestrated letters of support fromprominent men across the country, when the preliminary reportwas published on January 3, 1898. As soon as the report waspublished, Guthridge and Conant made these letters availableto the daily newspapers. Quickly, the two built up a distributionsystem to spread the gospel of the report, organizing nearly100,000 correspondents “dedicated to the enactment of the com-mission’s plan for banking and currency reform.”10The prime and immediate emphasis of the preliminary reportof the Indianapolis Monetary Commission was to complete thepromise of the McKinley victory by codifying and enactingwhat was already in place de facto: a single gold standard, withsilver reduced to the status of subsidiary token currency. Com-pleting the victory over Bryanism and free silver, however, wasjust a mopping-up operation; more important in the long runwas the call raised by the report for banking reform to allowgreater elasticity. Bank credit could then be increased in reces-sions and whenever seasonal pressure for redemption by agri-cultural country banks forced the large central reserve banks tocontract their loans. The actual measures called for by the com-mission were of marginal importance. (More important was thatthe question of banking reform had been raised at all.)The public having been aroused by the preliminary report,the executive committee decided to organize a second and finalmeeting of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention, which dulymet at Indianapolis on January 25, 1898. The second conventionwas a far grander affair than the first, bringing together 496 del-egates from 31 states. Furthermore, the gathering was a cross-section of America’s top corporate leaders. While the state ofIndiana naturally had the largest delegation, of 85 representa-tives of boards of trade and chambers of commerce, New Yorksent 74 delegates, including many from the Board of Trade and10Ibid., pp. 109–10."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"198A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IITransportation, the Merchants’ Association, and the Chamber ofCommerce in New York City.Such corporate leaders attended as Cleveland iron manu-facturer Alfred A. Pope, president of the National MalleableCastings Company; Virgil P. Cline, legal counsel to Rocke-feller’s Standard Oil Company of Ohio; and C.A. Pillsbury ofMinneapolis-St. Paul, organizer of the world’s largest flourmills. From Chicago came such business notables as MarshallField and Albert A. Sprague, a director of the Chicago Tele-phone Company, subsidiary of the Morgan-controlled tele-phone monopoly, American Telephone and Telegraph Com-pany. Not to be overlooked was delegate Franklin MacVeagh,a wholesale grocer from Chicago, and an uncle of a senior part-ner in the Wall Street law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy andMacVeagh, counsel to J.P. Morgan and Company. MacVeagh,who was later to become secretary of the Treasury in the Taftadministration, was wholly in the Morgan ambit. His father-in-law, Henry F. Eames, was the founder of the CommercialNational Bank of Chicago, and his brother Wayne was soon tobecome a trustee of the Morgan-dominated Mutual Life Insur-ance Company.The purpose of the second convention, as former Secretary ofthe Treasury Charles S. Fairchild candidly explained in hisaddress to the gathering, was to mobilize the nation’s leadingbusinessmen into a mighty and influential reform movement. Ashe put it, “If men of business give serious attention and study tothese subjects, they will substantially agree upon legislation,and thus agreeing, their influence will be prevailing.” He con-cluded, “My word to you is, pull all together.” Presiding officerof the convention, Iowa Governor Leslie M. Shaw, was, however,a bit disingenuous when he told the gathering, “You representtoday not the banks, for there are few bankers on this floor. Yourepresent the business industries and the financial interests ofthe country.” There were plenty of bankers there, too.11Shaw11Ibid., pp. 113–15."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve199himself, later to be secretary of the Treasury under TheodoreRoosevelt, was a small-town banker in Iowa, and president ofthe Bank of Denison who continued as bank president through-out his term as convention governor. More important in Shaw’soutlook and career was the fact that he was a longtime closefriend and loyal supporter of the Des Moines Regency, the IowaRepublican machine headed by the powerful Senator WilliamBoyd Allison. Allison, who was to obtain the Treasury post forhis friend, was in turn tied closely to Charles E. Perkins, a closeMorgan ally, president of the Chicago, Burlington and QuincyRailroad, and kinsman of the powerful Forbes financial group ofBoston, long tied in with the Morgan interests.12Also serving as delegates to the second convention were sev-eral eminent economists, each of whom, however, came not asacademic observers but as representatives of elements of thebusiness community.

Jenks of Cornell, aproponent of trust cartelization by government and soon tobecome a friend and adviser of Theodore Roosevelt as governor,came as delegate from the Ithaca Business Men’s Association.Frank W. Taussig of Harvard University represented the Cam-bridge Merchants’ Association. Yale’s Arthur Twining Hadley,soon to be the president of Yale, represented the New HavenChamber of Commerce, and Frank M. Taylor of the Universityof Michigan came as representative of the Ann Arbor BusinessMen’s Association. Each of these men held powerful posts in theorganized economics profession, Jenkins, Taussig, and Taylorserving on the currency committee of the American EconomicAssociation.

In themeantime, Conant met almost continuously with the bankingcommittee members. At each stage of the legislative process,Hanna sent letters to the convention delegates and to the public,urging a letter-writing campaign in support of the bill.In this agitation, McKinley Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J.Gage worked closely with Hanna and his staff. Gage sponsoredsimilar bills, and several bills along the same lines were intro-duced in the House in 1898 and 1899. Gage, a friend of severalof the monetary commissioners, was one of the top leaders ofthe Rockefeller interests in the banking field. His appointmentas Treasury secretary had been gained for him by Ohio’s MarkHanna, political mastermind and financial backer of PresidentMcKinley, and old friend, high-school classmate, and businessassociate of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. Before his appointment tothe cabinet, Gage was president of the powerful First NationalBank of Chicago, one of the major commercial banks in theRockefeller ambit. During his term in office, Gage tried to oper-ate the Treasury as a central bank, pumping in money during"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"202A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIrecessions by purchasing government bonds on the open mar-ket, and depositing large funds with pet commercial banks. In1900, Gage called vainly for the establishment of regional centralbanks.Finally, in his last annual report as secretary of the Treasuryin 1901, Lyman Gage let the cat completely out of the bag, call-ing outright for a government central bank. Without such acentral bank, he declared in alarm, “individual banks stand iso-lated and apart, separated units, with no tie of mutualitybetween them.” Unless a central bank established such ties,Gage warned, the panic of 1893 would be repeated.17When heleft office early the next year, Lyman Gage took up his post aspresident of the Rockefeller-controlled U.S. Trust Company inNew York City.18THEGOLDSTANDARDACT OF1900 ANDAFTERAny reform legislation had to wait until after the elections of1898, for the gold forces were not yet in control of Congress. Inthe autumn, the executive committee of the Indianapolis Mone-tary Convention mobilized its forces, calling on no less than97,000 correspondents throughout the country through whom ithad distributed the preliminary report. The executive commit-tee urged its constituency to elect a gold-standard Congress;when the gold forces routed the silverites in November, theresults of the election were hailed by Hanna as eminently satis-factory.The decks were now cleared for the McKinley administrationto submit its bill, and the Congress that met in December 1899quickly passed the measure; Congress then passed the confer-ence report of the Gold Standard Act in March 1900.The currency reformers had gotten their way. It is wellknown that the Gold Standard Act provided for a single gold17Livingston, Origins, p. 153.18Rothbard, “Federal Reserve,” pp. 94–95."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve203standard, with no retention of silver money except as tokens.Less well known are the clauses that began the march toward amore “elastic” currency. As Lyman Gage had suggested in 1897,national banks, previously confined to large cities, were nowmade possible with a small amount of capital in small towns andrural areas. And it was made far easier for national banks to issuenotes. The object of these clauses, as one historian put it, was tosatisfy an “increased demand for money at crop-moving time,and to meet popular cries for ‘more money’ by encouraging theorganization of national banks in comparatively undevelopedregions.”19The reformers exulted over the passage of the Gold StandardAct, but took the line that this was only the first step on themuch-needed path to fundamental banking reform. Thus, Pro-fessor Frank W. Taussig of Harvard praised the act, and greetedthe emergence of a new social and ideological alignment, causedby “strong pressure from the business community” through theIndianapolis Monetary Convention. He particularly welcomedthe fact that the Gold Standard Act “treats the national banksnot as grasping and dangerous corporations but as useful insti-tutions deserving the fostering care of the legislature.” But suchtender legislative care was not enough; fundamental bankingreform was needed. For, Taussig declared, “The changes in bank-ing legislation are not such as to make possible any considerableexpansion of the national system or to enable it to render thecommunity the full service of which it is capable.” In short, thechanges allowed for more and greater expansion of bank creditand the supply of money. Therefore, Taussig concluded, “It iswell nigh certain that eventually Congress will have to consideronce more the further remodeling of the national bank system.”20In fact, the Gold Standard Act of 1900 was only the openinggun of the banking reform movement.

Massachusetts-born Charles A.Conant (1861–1915), a leading historian of banking, wrote A His-tory of Modern Banks of Issuein 1896, while still a Washington cor-respondent for the New York Journal of Commerceand an editor ofBankers Magazine. After his stint of public relations work and lob-bying for the Indianapolis convention, Conant moved to NewYork in 1902 to become treasurer of the Morgan-oriented Mor-ton Trust Company. The two Chicagoans, both friends of LymanGage, were, along with Gage, in the Rockefeller ambit: Frank A.Vanderlip was picked by Gage as his assistant secretary of theTreasury, and when Gage left office, Vanderlip came to NewYork as a top executive at the flagship commercial bank of theRockefeller interests, the National City Bank of New York.Meanwhile, Vanderlip’s close friend and mentor at the ChicagoTribune,Joseph French Johnson, had also moved east to becomeprofessor of finance at the Wharton School of the University ofPennsylvania. But no sooner had the Gold Standard Act beenpassed when Joseph Johnson sounded the trump by calling formore fundamental reform.Professor Johnson stated flatly that the existing bank notesystem was weak in not “responding to the needs of the moneymarket,” that is, not supplying a sufficient amount of money.Since the national banking system was incapable of supplyingthose needs, Johnson opined, there was no reason to continue it.Johnson deplored the U.S. banking system as the worst in theworld, and pointed to the glorious central banking system asexisted in Britain and France.21But no such centralized bankingsystem yet existed in the United States:21Joseph French Johnson, “The Currency Act of March 14, 1900,”Political Science Quarterly15 (1900): 482–507.

In consequence, our massive deposit creditsystem “trembles whenever the foundations are disturbed,” thatis, whenever the chickens of inflationary credit expansion camehome to roost in demands for cash or gold. The result of theinelasticity of money, and of the impossibility of interbank coop-eration, Johnson opined, was that we were in danger of losinggold abroad just at the time when gold was needed to sustainconfidence in the nation’s banking system.22After 1900, the banking community was split on the ques-tion of reform, the small and rural bankers preferring the sta-tus quo. But the large bankers, headed by A. Barton Hepburnof Morgan’s Chase National Bank, drew up a bill as head of acommission of the American Bankers Association, and pre-sented it in late 1901 to Representative Charles N. Fowler ofNew Jersey, chairman of the House Banking and CurrencyCommittee, who had introduced one of the bills that had led tothe Gold Standard Act. The Hepburn proposal was reportedout of committee in April 1902 as the Fowler Bill.23The Fowler Bill contained three basic clauses. One allowedthe further expansion of national bank notes based on broaderassets than government bonds. The second, a favorite of the bigbanks, was to allow national banks to establish branches athome and abroad, a step illegal under the existing system due tofierce opposition by the small country bankers. While branchbanking is consonant with a free market and provides a soundand efficient system for calling on other banks for redemption,the big banks had little interest in branch banking unless accom-22Ibid., pp. 497 f.23Kolko, Triumph, pp. 149–50."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIpanied by centralization of the banking system. Thus, theFowler Bill proposed to create a three-member board of controlwithin the Treasury Department to supervise the creation of thenew bank notes and to establish clearinghouse associationsunder its aegis. This provision was designed to be the first steptoward the establishment of a full-fledged central bank.24Although they could not control the American Bankers Asso-ciation, the multitude of country bankers, up in arms against theproposed competition of big banks in the form of branch bank-ing, put fierce pressure upon Congress and managed to kill theFowler Bill in the House during 1902, despite the agitation of theexecutive committee and staff of the Indianapolis MonetaryConvention. With the defeat of the Fowler Bill, the big bankers decidedto settle for more modest goals for the time being. Senator Nel-son W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, perennial Republican leader ofthe U.S. Senate and Rockefeller’s man in Congress,25submit-ted the Aldrich Bill the following year, allowing the largenational banks in New York to issue “emergency currency”based on municipal and railroad bonds. But even this bill wasdefeated.Meeting setbacks in Congress, the big bankers decided toregroup and turn temporarily to the executive branch. Fore-shadowing a later, more elaborate collaboration, two powerfulrepresentatives each from the Morgan and Rockefeller bankinginterests met with Comptroller of the Currency William B.Ridgely in January 1903, to try to persuade him, by adminis-trative fiat, to restrict the volume of loans made by the country24See Livingston, Origins, pp. 150–54.25Nelson W.

The two Morgan men atthe meeting were J.P. Morgan and George F. Baker, Morgan’sclosest friend and associate in the banking business.26The twoRockefeller men were Frank Vanderlip and James Stillman,longtime chairman of the board of the National City Bank.27The close Rockefeller-Stillman alliance was cemented by themarriage of the two daughters of Stillman to the two sons ofWilliam Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., andlongtime board member of the National City Bank.28The meeting with the comptroller did not bear fruit, but thelead instead was taken by the secretary of the Treasury himself,Leslie Shaw, formerly presiding officer at the second IndianapolisMonetary Convention, whom President Roosevelt appointed toreplace Lyman Gage. The unexpected and sudden shift fromMcKinley to Roosevelt in the presidency meant more than just aturnover of personnel; it meant a fundamental shift from aRockefeller-dominated to a Morgan-dominated administration.In the same way, the shift from Gage to Shaw was one of themany Rockefeller-to-Morgan displacements. On monetary and banking matters, however, the Rockefellerand Morgan camps were as one. Secretary Shaw attempted tocontinue and expand Gage’s experiments in trying to make theTreasury function like a central bank, particularly in makingopen market purchases in recessions, and in using Treasurydeposits to bolster the banks and expand the money supply.Shaw violated the statutory institution of the independent Trea-26Baker was head of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank ofNew York, and served as a director of virtually every important Morgan-run enterprise, including: Chase National Bank, Guaranty Trust Company,Morton Trust Company, Mutual Life Insurance Company, AT&T,Consolidated Gas Company of New York, Erie Railroad, New YorkCentral Railroad, Pullman Company, and United States Steel.

Instead, he expanded the prac-tice of depositing Treasury funds in favored big national banks.Indeed, even banking reformers denounced the deposit of Trea-sury funds to pet banks as artificially lowering interest rates andleading to artificial expansion of credit. Furthermore, any gov-ernment deficit would obviously throw a system dependent ona flow of new government revenues into chaos. All in all, thereformers agreed increasingly with the verdict of economistAlexander Purves, that “the uncertainty as to the Secretary’spower to control the banks by arbitrary decisions and orders,and the fact that at some future time the country may be unfor-tunate in its chief Treasury official . . . [has] led many to doubtthe wisdom” of using the Treasury as a form of central bank.29In his last annual report of 1906, Secretary Shaw urged that hebe given total power to regulate all the nation’s banks. But thegame was up, and by then it was clear to the reformers thatShaw’s as well as Gage’s proto–central bank manipulations hadfailed. It was time to undertake a struggle for a fundamental leg-islative overhaul of the American banking system to bring itunder central banking control.30CHARLESA. CONANT, SURPLUSCAPITAL,ANDECONOMICIMPERIALISMThe years shortly before and after 1900 proved to be thebeginnings of the drive toward the establishment of a FederalReserve System. It was also the origin of the gold-exchangestandard, the fateful system imposed upon the world by theBritish in the 1920s and by the United States after World War IIat Bretton Woods. Even more than the case of a gold standard29Livingston, Origins, p. 156.

The ideawas to replace a genuine gold standard, in which each country(or, domestically, each bank) maintains its reserves in gold, by apseudo-gold standard in which the central bank of the clientcountry maintains its reserves in some key or base currency, saypounds or dollars. Thus, during the 1920s, most countries main-tained their reserves in pounds, and only Britain purported toredeem pounds in gold. This meant that these other countrieswere really on a pound rather than a gold standard, althoughthey were able, at least temporarily, to acquire the prestige ofgold. It also meant that when Britain inflated pounds, there wasno danger of losing gold to these other countries, who, quite thecontrary, happily inflated their own currencies on top of theirexpanding balances in pounds sterling. Thus, there was gener-ated an unstable, inflationary system—all in the name of gold—in which client states pyramided their own inflation on top ofGreat Britain’s. The system was eventually bound to collapse, asdid the gold-exchange standard in the Great Depression andBretton Woods by the late 1960s. In addition, the close ties basedon pounds and then dollars meant that the key or base countrywas able to exert a form of economic imperialism, joined by itscommon paper and pseudo-gold inflation, upon the client statesusing the key money.By the late 1890s, groups of theoreticians in the UnitedStates were working on what would later be called the “Lenin-ist” theory of capitalist imperialism. The theory was origi-nated, not by Lenin but by advocates of imperialism, centeringaround such Morgan-oriented friends and brain trusters ofTheodore Roosevelt as Henry Adams, Brooks Adams, AdmiralAlfred T. Mahan, and Massachusetts Senator Henry CabotLodge. The idea was that capitalism in the developed countrieswas “overproducing,” not simply in the sense that more pur-chasing power was needed in recessions, but more deeply inthat the rate of profit was therefore inevitably falling. The everlower rate of profit from the “surplus capital” was in danger of"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIcrippling capitalism, except that salvation loomed in the formof foreign markets and especially foreign investments. Newand expanded foreign markets would increase profits, at leasttemporarily, while investments in undeveloped countrieswould be bound to bring a high rate of profit. Hence, to saveadvanced capitalism, it was necessary for Western govern-ments to engage in outright imperialist or neo-imperialist ven-tures, which would force other countries to open their marketsfor American products and would force open investmentopportunities abroad.Given this doctrine—based on the fallacious Ricardian viewthat the rate of profit is determined by the stock of capital invest-ment, instead of by the time preferences of everyone in society—there was little for Lenin to change except to give an implicitmoral condemnation instead of approval and to emphasize thenecessarily temporary nature of the respite imperialism couldfurnish for capitalists.31Charles Conant set forth the theory of surplus capital in his AHistory of Modern Banks of Issue(1896) and developed it in sub-sequent essays. The existence of fixed capital and modern tech-nology, Conant claimed, invalidated Say’s Law and the conceptof equilibrium, and led to chronic “oversavings,” which hedefined as savings in excess of profitable investment outlets, inthe developed Western capitalist world. Business cycles, opinedConant, were inherent in the unregulated activity of modernindustrial capitalism. Hence the importance of government-encouraged monopolies and cartels to stabilize markets and the31Indeed, the adoption of this theory of the alleged necessity forimperialism in the “later stages” of capitalism went precisely from pro-imperialists like the U.S. Investor,Charles A. Conant, and Brooks Adams in1898–99, read and adopted by the Marxist H. Gaylord Wilshire in 1900–01,in turn read and adopted by the English left-liberal anti-imperialist John A.Hobson, who in turn influenced Lenin.

Conant responded with hiscall for imperialism in “The Economic Basis of Imperialism” inthe September 1898 North American Review, and in other essayscollected in The United States in the Orient: The Nature of the Eco-nomic Problemand published in 1900. S.J. Chapman, a distin-guished British economist, accurately summarized Conant’sargument as follows: (1) “In all advanced countries there hasbeen such excessive saving that no profitable investment forcapital remains,” (2) since all countries do not practice a policyof commercial freedom, “America must be prepared to useforce if necessary” to open up profitable investment outletsabroad, and (3) the United States possesses an advantage in thecoming struggle, since the organization of many of its indus-tries “in the form of trusts will assist it greatly in the fight forcommercial supremacy.”32The war successfully won, Conant was particularly enthusi-astic about the United States keeping the Philippines, the gate-way to the great potential Asian market. The United States, heopined, should not be held back by “an abstract theory” to adopt“extreme conclusions” on applying the doctrines of the Found-ing Fathers on the importance of the consent of the governed.The Founding Fathers, he declared, surely meant that self-gov-ernment could only apply to those competent to exercise it, arequirement that clearly did not apply to the backward peopleof the Philippines. After all, Conant wrote, “Only by the firmhand of the responsible governing races . . . can the assurance of32Review of Charles A.

Domesticsociety, he claimed, would have to be transformed to make thenation as “efficient” as possible. Efficiency, in particular, meantcentralized concentration of power. “Concentration of power, inorder to permit prompt and efficient action, will be an almostessential factor in the struggle for world empire.” In particular,it was important for the United States to learn from the magnif-icent centralization of power and purpose in Czarist Russia.The government of the United States would require “a degreeof harmony and symmetry which will permit the direction ofthe whole power of the state toward definite and intelligentpolicies.” The U.S. Constitution would have to be amended topermit a form of czarist absolutism, or at the very least an enor-mously expanded executive power in foreign affairs.34An interesting case study of business opinion energized andconverted by the lure of imperialism was the Boston weekly, theU.S. Investor. Before the outbreak of war with Spain in 1898, theU.S. Investor denounced the idea of war as a disaster to business.But after the United States launched its war, and CommodoreDewey seized Manila Bay, the Investortotally changed its tune.Now it hailed the war as excellent for business, and as bringingabout recovery from the previous recession. Soon the Investorwas happily advocating a policy of “imperialism” to make U.S.prosperity permanent. Imperialism conveyed marvelous bene-fits to the country. At home, a big army and navy would be valu-able in curbing the tendency of democracy to enjoy “a too greatfreedom from restraint, both of action and of thought.” TheInvestoradded that “European experience demonstrates that the33David Healy, U.S. Expansionism: The Imperialist Urge in the 1890s(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1970), pp. 200–01.34Ibid., pp. 202–03."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve213army and navy are admirably adopted to inculcate orderlyhabits of thought and action.”But an even more important benefit from a policy of perma-nent imperialism is economic. To keep “capital . . . at work,”stern necessity requires that “an enlarged field for its productmust be discovered.” Specifically, “a new field” had to be foundfor selling the growing flood of goods produced by the advancednations, and for investment of their savings at profitable rates.TheInvestor exulted in the fact that this new “field lies ready foroccupancy. It is to be found among the semi-civilized and bar-barian races,” in particular the beckoning country of China.Particularly interesting was the colloquy that ensued betweenthe Investor,and the Springfield (Mass.) Republican, which stillpropounded the older theory of free trade and laissez-faire. TheRepublicanasked why trade with undeveloped countries was notsufficient without burdening U.S. taxpayers with administrativeand military overhead. TheRepublicanalso attacked the new the-ory of surplus capital, pointing out that only two or three yearsearlier, businessmen had been loudly calling for more Europeancapital to be invested in American ventures. To the first charge, the Investorfell back on “the experience ofthe race for, perhaps ninety centuries, [which] has been in thedirection of foreign acquisitions as a means of national prosper-ity.” But, more practically, the Investordelighted over the good-ies that imperialism would bring to American business in theway of government contracts and the governmental develop-ment of what would now be called the “infrastructure” of thecolonies. Furthermore, as in Britain, a greatly expanded diplo-matic service would provide “a new calling for our young menof education and ability.”To the Republican’ssecond charge, on surplus capital, theInvestor, like Conant, developed the idea of a new age that hadjust arrived in American affairs, an age of large-scale andhence overproduction, an age of a low rate of profit, and con-sequent formation of trusts in a quest for higher profitsthrough suppression of competition. As the Investorput it,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II“The excess of capital has resulted in an unprofitable competi-tion. To employ Franklin’s witticism, the owners of capital are ofthe opinion they must hang together or else they will all hangseparately.” But while trusts may solve the problem of specificindustries, they did not solve the great problem of a general“congestion of capital.” Indeed, wrote the Investor, “findingemployment for capital . . . is now the greatest of all economicproblems that confront us.”To the Investor, the way out was clear: [T]he logical path to be pursued is that of the development ofthe natural riches of the tropical countries. These countriesare now peopled by races incapable on their own initiative ofextracting its full riches from their own soil. . . . This will beattained in some cases by the mere stimulus of governmentand direction by men of the temperate zones; but it will beattained also by the application of modern machinery andmethods of culture to the agricultural and mineral resourcesof the undeveloped countries.35By the spring of 1901, even the eminent economic theoristJohn Bates Clark of Columbia University was able to embracethe new creed. Reviewing pro-imperialist works by Conant,Brooks Adams, and the Reverend Josiah Strong in a single cele-bratory review in March 1901 in the Political Science Quarterly,Clark emphasized the importance of opening foreign marketsand particularly of investing American capital “with an evenlarger and more permanent profit.”36J.B. Clark was not the only economist ready to join in apolo-gia for the strong state. Throughout the land by the turn of thetwentieth century, a legion of economists and other social scien-tists had arisen, many of them trained in graduate schools inGermany to learn of the virtues of the inductive method, theGerman Historical School, and a collectivist, organicist state.35The Investor,19 January 1901, pp. 65–66, cited in Etherington, Theoriesof Imperialism, p. 17.

Professor Edwin R.A.Seligman of Columbia University, of the prominent Wall Streetinvestment banking family of J. and W. Seligman and Company,spoke for many of these social scientists when, in a presidentialaddress before the American Economic Association in 1903, hehailed the “new industrial order.”37Seligman prophesied that inthe new, twentieth century, the possession of economic knowl-edge would grant economists the power “to control . . . andmold” the material forces of progress. As the economist provedable to forecast more accurately, he would be installed as “thereal philosopher of social life,” and the public would pay “def-erence to his views.”In his 1899 presidential address, Yale President Arthur Twin-ing Hadley also saw economists developing as society’s philoso-pher-kings. The most important application of economic knowl-edge, declared Hadley, was leadership in public life, becomingadvisers and leaders of national policy. Hadley opined, I believe that their [economists’] largest opportunity in theimmediate future lies not in theories but in practice, not withstudents but with statesmen, not in the education of individ-ual citizens, however widespread and salutary, but in theleadership of an organized body politic.38Hadley perceptively saw the executive branch of the govern-ment as particularly amenable to access of position and influence37Seligman was also related by marriage to the Loebs and to PaulWarburg of Kuhn, Loeb.

Previously, executives werehampered in seeking such expert counsel by the importance ofpolitical parties, their ideological commitments, and their massbase in the voting population. But now, fortunately, the growingmunicipal reform (soon to be called the Progressive) movementwas taking power away from political parties and putting it intothe hands of administrators and experts. The “increased central-ization of administrative power [was giving] . . . the expert a fairchance.” And now, on the national scene, the new American leapinto imperialism in the Spanish-American War was providing anopportunity for increased centralization, executive power, andtherefore for administrative and expert planning. Even thoughHadley declared himself personally opposed to imperialism, heurged economists to leap at this great opportunity for access topower.39The organized economic profession was not slow to grasp thisnew opportunity. Quickly, the executive and nominating com-mittees of the American Economic Association (AEA) created afive-man special committee to organize and publish a volume oncolonial finance. As Silva and Slaughter put it, this new, rapidlyput-together volume permitted the AEA to show the power elite how the new social science could serve the interests of thosewho made imperialism a national policy by offering techni-cal solutions to the immediate fiscal problems of colonies aswell as providing ideological justifications for acquiringthem.40Chairman of the special committee was Professor Jeremiah W.Jenks of Cornell, the major economic adviser to New YorkGovernor Theodore Roosevelt.

A third col-league was Dr. Albert Shaw, influential editor of the Review ofReviews,progressive reformer and social scientist, and longtimecrony of Roosevelt’s.

Essays in Colonial Finance, the volume quickly put together bythese five leaders, tried to advise the United States how best torun its newly acquired empire. First, just as the British govern-ment insisted when the North American states were its colonies,the colonies should support their imperial government throughtaxation, whereas control should be tightly exercised by theUnited States imperial center. Second, the imperial center shouldbuild and maintain the economic infrastructure of the colony:canals, railroads, communications. Third, where—as was clearlyanticipated—native labor is inefficient or incapable of manage-ment, the imperial government should import (white) labor fromthe imperial center. And, finally, as Silva and Slaughter put it, the committee’s fiscal recommendations strongly intimatedthat trained economists were necessary for a successfulempire. It was they who must make a thorough study oflocal conditions to determine the correct fiscal system, gatherdata, create the appropriate administrative design and per-haps even implement it.

In"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve219brief, the developed Western countries by this time were on thegold standard, while most of the Third World nations were onthe silver standard. For the past several decades, the value ofsilver in relation to gold had been steadily falling, due to (1) anincreasing world supply of silver relative to gold, and (2) thesubsequent shift of many Western nations from silver or bimet-allism to gold, thereby lowering the world’s demand for silveras a monetary metal.The fall of silver value meant monetary depreciation andinflation in the Third World, and it would have been a reason-able policy to shift from a silver-coin to a gold-coin standard.But the new imperialists among U.S. bankers, economists, andpoliticians were far less interested in the welfare of Third Worldcountries than in foisting a monetary imperialism upon them.For not only would the economies of the imperial center and theclient states then be tied together, but they would be tied in sucha way that these economies could pyramid their own monetaryand bank credit inflation on top of inflation in the United States.Hence, what the new imperialists set out to do was to pressureor coerce Third World countries to adopt, not a genuine gold-coin standard, but a newly conceived “gold-exchange” or dollarstandard. Instead of silver currency fluctuating freely in terms of gold,the silver-gold rate would then be fixed by arbitrary governmentprice-fixing. The silver countries would be silver in name only; acountry’s monetary reserve would be held, not in silver, but indollars allegedly redeemable in gold; and these reserves wouldbe held, not in the country itself, but as dollars piled up in NewYork City. In that way, if U.S. banks inflated their credit, therewould be no danger of losing gold abroad, as would happenunder a genuine gold standard. For under a true gold standard,no one and no country would be interested in piling up claimsto dollars overseas. Instead, they would demand payment ofdollar claims in gold. So that even though these Americanbankers and economists were all too aware, after many decadesof experience, of the fallacies and evils of bimetallism, they were"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIwilling to impose a form of bimetallism upon client states inorder to tie them into U.S. economic imperialism, and to pres-sure them into inflating their own money supplies on top of dol-lar reserves supposedly, but not de facto redeemable in gold.The United States first confronted the problem of silver cur-rencies in a Third World country when it seized control ofPuerto Rico from Spain in 1898 and occupied it as a permanentcolony. Fortunately for the imperialists, Puerto Rico wasalready ripe for currency manipulation. Only three years ear-lier, in 1895, Spain had destroyed the full-bodied Mexican sil-ver currency that its colony had previously enjoyed andreplaced it with a heavily debased silver “dollar,” worth only41¢ in U.S. currency. The Spanish government had pocketedthe large seigniorage profits from that debasement. The UnitedStates was therefore easily able to substitute its own debasedsilver dollar, worth only 45.6¢ in gold. Thus, the United Statessilver currency replaced an even more debased one and alsothe Puerto Ricans had no tradition of loyalty to a currency onlyrecently imposed by the Spaniards. There was therefore littleor no opposition in Puerto Rico to the U.S. monetarytakeover.42The major controversial question was what exchange rate theAmerican authorities would fix between the two debased coins:the old Puerto Rican silver peso and the U.S. silver dollar. Thiswas the rate at which the U.S. authorities would compel thePuerto Ricans to exchange their existing coinage for the newAmerican coins. The treasurer in charge of the currency reformfor the U.S. government was the prominent Johns Hopkinseconomist Jacob H. Hollander, who had been special commis-sioner to revise Puerto Rican tax laws, and who was one of thenew breed of academic economists repudiating laissez-faire forcomprehensive statism. The heavy debtors in Puerto Rico—mainly the large sugar planters—naturally wanted to pay their42See the illuminating article by Emily S.

In contrast, the Puerto Ricanbanker-creditors wanted the rate fixed at 75¢. Since theexchange rate was arbitrary anyway, Hollander and the otherAmerican officials decided in the time-honored way of govern-ments: more or less splitting the difference, and fixing a pesoequal to 60¢.43The Philippines, the other Spanish colony grabbed by theUnited States, posed a far more difficult problem. As in most ofthe Far East, the Philippines was happily using a perfectlysound silver currency, the Mexican silver dollar. But the UnitedStates was anxious for a rapid reform, because its large armedforces establishment suppressing Filipino nationalism requiredheavy expenses in U.S. dollars, which it of course declared to belegal tender for payments. Since the Mexican silver coin was alsolegal tender and was cheaper than the U.S. gold dollar, the U.S.military occupation found its revenues being paid in unwantedand cheaper Mexican coins.Delicacy was required, and in 1901, for the task of currencytakeover, the Bureau of Insular Affairs (BIA) of the War Depart-ment—the agency running the U.S. occupation of the Philip-pines—hired Charles A. Conant. Secretary of War Elihu Rootwas a redoubtable Wall Street lawyer in the Morgan ambit whosometimes served as J.P. Morgan’s personal attorney.

Under his cunning plan, the Filipinos wouldcontinue to have a silver currency; but replacing the full-bodiedMexican silver coin would be an American silver coin tied togold at a debased value far less than the market exchange valueof silver in terms of gold. In this imposed, debased bimetallism,since the silver coin was deliberately overvalued in relation togold by the U.S. government, Gresham’s Law inexorably wentinto effect. The overvalued silver would keep circulating in thePhilippines, and undervalued gold would be kept sharply outof circulation.The seigniorage profit that the Treasury would reap from thedebasement would be happily deposited at a New York bank,which would then function as a “reserve” for the U.S. silvercurrency in the Philippines. Thus, the New York funds would beused for payment outside the Philippines instead of as coin orspecie. Moreover, the U.S. government could issue paper dollarsbased on its new reserve fund.It should be noted that Conant originated the gold-exchangescheme as a way of exploiting and controlling Third Worldeconomies based on silver. At the same time, Great Britain wasintroducing similar schemes in its colonial areas in Egypt, inStraits Settlements in Asia, and particularly in India.Congress, however, pressured by the silver lobby, balked atthe BIA’s plan. And so the BIA again turned to the seasonedpublic relations and lobbying skills of Charles A. Conant.Conant swung into action. Meeting with editors of the topfinancial journals, he secured their promises to write editorialspushing for the Conant plan, many of which he obliginglywrote himself. He was already backed by the American banks"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve223of Manila. Recalcitrant U.S. bankers were warned by Conantthat they could no longer expect large government depositsfrom the War Department if they continued to oppose the plan.Furthermore, Conant won the support of the major enemies ofhis plan, the American silver companies and pro-silver bankers,promising them that if the Philippine currency reform wentthrough, the federal government would buy silver for the newU.S. coinage in the Philippines from these same companies.Finally, the tireless lobbying, and the mixture of bribery andthreats by Conant, paid off: Congress passed the PhilippineCurrency Bill in March 1903.In the Philippines, however, the United States could not sim-ply duplicate the Puerto Rican example and coerce the conver-sion of the old for the new silver coinage. The Mexican silvercoin was a dominant coin not only in the Far East but through-out the world, and the coerced conversion would have beenendless. The U.S. tried; it removed the legal tender privilegefrom the Mexican coins, and decreed the new U.S. coins be usedfor taxes, government salaries, and other government pay-ments. But this time the Filipinos happily used the old Mexicancoins as money, while the U.S. silver coins disappeared from cir-culation into payment of taxes and transactions to the UnitedStates.The War Department was beside itself: How could it driveMexican silver coinage out of the Philippines? In desperation, itturned to the indefatigable Conant, but Conant couldn’t join thecolonial government in the Philippines because he had just beenappointed to a more far-flung presidential commission on inter-national exchange for pressuring Mexico and China to go on asimilar gold-exchange standard. Hollander, fresh from hisPuerto Rican triumph, was ill. Who else? Conant, Hollander,and several leading bankers told the War Department theycould recommend no one for the job, so new then was the pro-fession of technical expertise in monetary imperialism. But therewas one more hope, the other pro-cartelist and financial imperi-alist, Cornell’s Jeremiah W. Jenks, a fellow member with Conant"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIof President Roosevelt’s new Commission on InternationalExchange (CIE). Jenks had already paved the way for Conant byvisiting English and Dutch colonies in the Far East in 1901 togain information about running the Philippines. Jenks finallycame up with a name, his former graduate student at Cornell,Edwin W. Kemmerer.Young Kemmerer went to the Philippines from 1903 to 1906to implement the Conant plan. Based on the theories of Jenksand Conant, and on his own experience in the Philippines, Kem-merer went on to teach at Cornell and then at Princeton, andgained fame throughout the 1920s as the “money doctor,” busilyimposing the gold-exchange standard on country after countryabroad.Relying on Conant’s behind-the-scenes advice, Kemmererand his associates finally came out with a successful scheme todrive out the Mexican silver coins. It was a plan that reliedheavily on government coercion. The United States imposed alegal prohibition on the importation of the Mexican coins, fol-lowed by severe taxes on any private Philippine transactionsdaring to use the Mexican currency. Luckily for the planners,their scheme was aided by a large-scale demand at the time forMexican silver in northern China, which absorbed silver fromthe Philippines or that would have been smuggled into theislands. The U.S. success was aided by the fact that the new U.S.silver coins, perceptively called “conants” by the Filipinos,were made up to look very much like the cherished old Mexi-can coins. By 1905, force, luck, and trickery had prevailed, andthe conants (worth 50¢ in U.S. money) were the dominant cur-rency in the Philippines. Soon the U.S. authorities were confi-dent enough to add token copper coins and paper conants aswell.4444See Rosenberg, “Foundations,“ pp. 177–81.

InMexico itself, U.S. industrialists who wanted to invest therepressured the Mexicans to shift from silver to gold, and theyfound an ally in Mexico’s powerful finance minister, JoseLimantour. But tackling the Mexican silver peso at home wouldnot be an easy task, for the coin was known and used through-out the world, particularly in China, where it formed the bulk ofthe circulating coinage. Finally, after three-way talks betweenUnited States, Mexican, and Chinese officials, the Mexicans andChinese were induced to send identical notes to the U.S. secre-tary of state, urging the United States to appoint financial advis-ers to bring about currency reform and stabilized exchange rateswith the gold countries.45These requests gave President Roosevelt, upon securing con-gressional approval, the excuse to appoint in March 1903 athree-man Commission on International Exchange to bringabout currency reform in Mexico, China, and the rest of the sil-ver-using world.

Chairman was Hugh H. Hanna, of the Indi-anapolis Monetary Commission; the others were his formerchief aide at that commission, Charles A. Conant, and ProfessorJeremiah W. Jenks. Conant, as usual, was the major theoreticianand finagler. He realized that major opposition to Mexico’s andChina’s going off silver would come from the important Mexi-can silver industry, and he devised a scheme to get Europeancountries to purchase large amounts of Mexican silver to easethe pain of the shift.In a trip to European nations in the summer of 1903, however,Conant and the CIE found the Europeans less than enthusiasticabout making Mexican silver purchases as well as subsidizingU.S. exports and investments in China, a land whose marketthey too were coveting. In the United States, on the other hand,major newspapers and financial periodicals, prodded byConant’s public relations work, warmly endorsed the new cur-rency scheme.In the meanwhile, however, the United States faced similarcurrency problems in its two new Caribbean protectorates,Cuba and Panama. Panama was easy. The United States occu-pied the Canal Zone, and would be importing vast amounts ofequipment to build the canal, so it decided to impose the Amer-ican gold dollar as the currency in the nominally independentRepublic of Panama. While the gold dollar was the official cur-rency of Panama, the United States imposed as the actualmedium of exchange a new debased silver peso worth 50¢. For-tunately, the new peso was almost the same in value as the oldColombian silver coin it forcibly displaced, and so, like PuertoRico, the takeover could go without a hitch.Among the U.S. colonies or protectorates, Cuba proved thetoughest nut to crack. Despite all of Conant’s ministrations,Cuba’s currency remained unreformed. Spanish gold and silvercoins, French coins, and U.S. currency all circulated side by"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve227side, freely fluctuating in response to supply and demand. Fur-thermore, similar to the pre-reformed Philippines, a fixedbimetallic exchange rate between the cheaper U.S., and themore valuable Spanish and French coins, led the Cubans toreturn cheaper U.S. coins to the U.S. customs authorities in feesand revenues.Why then did Conant fail in Cuba? In the first place, strongCuban nationalism resented U.S. plans for seizing control oftheir currency. Conant’s repeated request in 1903 for a Cubaninvitation for the CIE to visit the island met stern rejections fromthe Cuban government. Moreover, the charismatic U.S. militarycommander in Cuba, Leonard Wood, wanted to avoid givingthe Cubans the impression that plans were afoot to reduce Cubato colonial status. The second objection was economic. The powerful sugarindustry in Cuba depended on exports to the United States, anda shift from depreciated silver to higher-valued gold moneywould increase the cost of sugar exports, by an amount LeonardWood estimated to be about 20 percent. While the same problemhad existed for the sugar planters in Puerto Rico, American eco-nomic interests, in Puerto Rico and in other countries such as thePhilippines, favored forcing formerly silver countries onto agold-based standard so as to stimulate U.S. exports into thosecountries. In Cuba, on the other hand, there was increasing U.S.investment capital pouring into the Cuban sugar plantations, sothat powerful and even dominant U.S. economic interestsexisted on the other side of the currency reform question.Indeed, by World War I, American investments in Cuban sugarreached the sum of $95 million.Thus, when Charles Conant resumed his pressure for aCuban gold-exchange standard in 1907, he was stronglyopposed by the U.S. governor of Cuba, Charles Magoon, whoraised the problem of a gold-based standard crippling thesugar planters.

However, the success of this shift, in the MexicanCurrency Reform Act of 1905, was assured by a world rise in theprice of silver, starting the following year, which made goldcoins cheaper than silver, with Gresham’s Law bringing about asuccessful gold-coin currency in Mexico. But the U.S. silvercoinage in the Philippines ran into trouble because of the rise inthe world silver price. Here, the U.S. silver currency in thePhilippines was bailed out by coordinated action by the Mexi-can government, which sold silver in the Philippines to lowerthe value of silver sufficiently so that the conants could bebrought back into circulation.47The big failure of Conant-CIE monetary imperialism was inChina. In 1900, Britain, Japan, and the United States intervenedin China to put down the Boxer Rebellion. The three countriesthereupon forced defeated China to agree to pay them and allmajor European powers an indemnity of $333 million. The UnitedStates interpreted the treaty as an obligation to pay in gold, butChina, on a depreciated silver standard, began to pay in silver in1903, an action that enraged the three treaty powers. The U.S.minister to China reported that Britain might declare China’spayment in silver a violation of the treaty, which would presagemilitary intervention.Emboldened by United States success in the Philippines,Panama, and Mexico, Secretary of War Root sent Jeremiah W.Jenks on a mission to China in early 1904 to try to transform46See Rosenberg, “Foundations,” pp. 186–88.47It is certainly possible that one of the reasons for the outbreak of thenationalist Mexican Revolution of 1910, in part a revolution against U.S.influence, was reaction against the U.S.-led currency manipulation andthe coerced shift from silver to gold.

They saw and denounced theseigniorage of the gold-exchange standard as an irresponsibleand immoral debasement of Chinese currency, an act that wouldimpoverish China while adding to the profits of U.S. bankswhere seigniorage reserve funds would be deposited.

Hollander, son-in-lawof prominent Baltimore merchant Abraham Hutzler, used hisconnection with Kuhn, Loeb and Company to place Dominicanbonds with that investment bank. Hollander also engaged hap-pily in double-dipping for the same work, collecting fees for thesame job from the State Department and from the Dominicangovernment. When this peccadillo was discovered in 1911, thescandal made it impossible for the U.S. government to use itsown employees and its own funds to push for gold-exchangeexperts abroad. From then on, there was more of a public-pri-vate partnership between the U.S. government and the invest-ment bankers, with the bankers supplying their own funds, andthe State Department supplying good will and more concreteresources.Thus, in 1911 and 1912, the United States, over great opposi-tion, imposed a gold-exchange standard on Nicaragua. TheState Department formally stepped aside but approved CharlesConant’s hiring by the powerful investment banking firm ofBrown Brothers to bring about a loan and the currency reform.The State Department lent not only its approval to the project,but also its official wires, for Conant and Brown Brothers to con-duct the negotiations with the Nicaraguan government.By the time he died in Cuba in 1915, Charles Conant hadmade himself the chief theoretician and practitioner of the gold-exchange and the economic imperialist movements. Aside fromhis successes in the Philippines, Panama, and Mexico, and hisfailures in Cuba and China, Conant led in pushing for gold-exchange reform and gold-dollar imperialism in Liberia,Bolivia, Guatemala, and Honduras. His magnum opus in favorof the gold-exchange standard, the two-volume The Principles ofMoney and Banking(1905), as well as his pathbreaking success inthe Philippines, was followed by a myriad of books, articles,pamphlets, and editorials, always backed up by his personalpropaganda efforts."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve231Particularly interesting were Conant’s arguments in favor ofa gold-exchange standard, rather than a genuine gold-coinstandard. A straight gold-coin standard, Conant believed, didnot provide a sufficient amount of gold to provide for theworld’s monetary needs. Hence, by tying the existing silver stan-dards in the undeveloped countries to gold, the “shortage” ofgold could be overcome, and also the economies of the undevel-oped countries could be integrated into those of the dominantimperial power. All this could only be done if the gold-exchangestandard were “designed and implemented by careful govern-ment policy,” but of course Conant himself and his friends anddisciples always stood ready to advise and provide such imple-mentation.50In addition, adopting a government-managed gold-exchangestandard was superior to either genuine gold or bimetallismbecause it left each state the flexibility of adapting its currencyto local needs. As Conant asserted,It leaves each state free to choose the means of exchange whichconform best to its local conditions. Rich nations are free tochoose gold, nations less rich silver, and those whose financialmethods are most advanced are free to choose paper.It is interesting that for Conant, paper was the most “advanced”form of money. It is clear that the devotion to the gold standardof Conant and his colleagues, was only to a debased and infla-tionary standard, controlled and manipulated by the U.S. gov-ernment, with gold really serving as a façade of allegedly hardmoney.And one of the critical forms of government manipulationand control in Conant’s proposed system was the existence andactive functioning of a central bank. As a founder of the “science”of financial advising to governments, Conant, followed by hiscolleagues and disciples, not only pushed a gold-exchange stan-dard wherever he could do so, but also advocated a central bank50Rosenberg, “Foundations,” p. 197."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIto manage and control that standard. As Emily Rosenbergpoints out:Conant thus did not neglect . . . one of the major revolution-ary changes implicit in his system: a new, important role fora central bank as a currency stabilizer. Conant strongly sup-ported the American banking reform that culminated in theFederal Reserve System . . . and American financial adviserswho followed Conant would spread central banking sys-tems, along with gold-standard currency reforms, to thecountries they advised.51Along with a managed gold-exchange standard would come,as replacement for the old free-trade, nonmanaged, gold-coinstandard, a world of imperial currency blocs, which “wouldnecessarily come into being as lesser countries deposited theirgold stabilization funds in the banking systems of moreadvanced countries.”52New York and London banks, in partic-ular, shaped up as the major reserve fund-holders in the devel-oping new world monetary order.It is no accident that the United States’ major financial andimperial rival, Great Britain, which was pioneering in imposinggold-exchange standards in its own colonial area at this time,built upon this experience to impose a gold-exchange standard,marked by all European currencies pyramiding on top of Britishinflation, during the 1920s. That disastrous inflationary experi-ment led straight to the worldwide banking crash and the gen-eral shift to fiat paper moneys in the early 1930s. After WorldWar II, the United States took up the torch of a world gold-exchange standard at Bretton Woods, with the dollar replacingthe pound sterling in a worldwide inflationary system thatlasted approximately 25 years.Nor should it be thought that Charles A.

In the Nicaragua negotiations, Conant was employedby the investment bank of Brown Brothers, and in pressuringother countries he was working for Speyer and Company andother investment bankers.After Conant died in 1915, there were few to pick up themantle of foreign financial advising. Hollander was in disgraceafter the Dominican debacle. Jenks was aging, and lived in theshadow of his China failure, but the State Department didappoint Jenks to serve as a director of the Nicaraguan NationalBank in 1917, and also hired him to study the Nicaraguan finan-cial picture in 1925. But the true successor of Conant was Edwin W. Kemmerer,the “money doctor.” After his Philippine experience, Kemmererjoined his old Professor Jenks at Cornell, and then moved toPrinceton in 1912, publishing his book Modern Currency Reformsin 1916. As the leading foreign financial adviser of the 1920s,Kemmerer not only imposed central banks and a gold-exchangestandard on Third World countries, but he also got them to levyhigher taxes. Kemmerer, too, combined his public employmentwith service to leading international bankers. During the 1920s,Kemmerer worked as banking expert for the U.S. government’sDawes Commission, headed special financial advisory missionsto more than a dozen countries, and was kept on a handsomeretainer by the distinguished investment banking firm of Dillon,Read from 1922 to 1929.

Schiff, head ofthe Wall Street investment bank of Kuhn, Loeb and Company,before the New York Chamber of Commerce. Schiff complainedthat in the autumn of 1905, when “the country needed money,”the Treasury, instead of working to expand the money supply,reduced government deposits in the national banks, thereby pre-cipitating a financial crisis, a “disgrace” in which the New Yorkclearinghouse banks had been forced to contract their loans dras-tically, sending interest rates sky-high. An “elastic currency” forthe nation was therefore imperative, and Schiff urged the NewYork chamber’s committee on finance to draw up a comprehen-sive plan for a modern banking system to provide for an elasticcurrency.54A colleague who had already been agitating for a cen-tral bank behind the scenes was Schiff’s partner, Paul MoritzWarburg, who had suggested the plan to Schiff as early as 1903.Warburg had emigrated from the German investment firm ofM.M. Warburg and Company in 1897, and before long his major53For an excellent study of the Kemmerer missions in the 1920s, seeRobert N.

WhenFrank A. Vanderlip, of Rockefeller’s flagship bank, the NationalCity Bank of New York, reported on this development, his boss,James Stillman, suggested that a new five-man special commis-sion be set up by the New York chamber to come back with aplan for currency reform.In response, Vanderlip proposed that the five-man commis-sion consist of himself; Schiff; J.P. Morgan; George Baker of theFirst National Bank of New York, Morgan’s closest and longestassociate; and former Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage,now president of the Rockefeller-controlled U.S. Trust Com-pany. Thus, the commission would consist of two Rockefellermen (Vanderlip and Gage), two Morgan men (Morgan andBaker), and one representative from Kuhn, Loeb. Only Vander-lip was available to serve, however, so the commission had to beredrawn. In addition to Vanderlip, beginning in March 1906,there sat, instead of Schiff, his close friend Isidore Straus, adirector of R.H. Macy and Company. Instead of Morgan andBaker there now served two Morgan men: Dumont Clarke,president of the American Exchange National Bank and a per-sonal adviser to J.P. Morgan, and Charles A. Conant, treasurerof Morton and Company. The fifth man was a veteran of theIndianapolis Monetary Convention, John Claflin, of H.B. Claflin55Schiff and Warburg were related by marriage. Schiff, from a promi-nent German banker family himself, was a son-in-law of Solomon Loeb,cofounder of Kuhn, Loeb; and Warburg, husband of Nina Loeb, wasanother son-in-law of Solomon Loeb’s by a second wife. The incestuous cir-cle was completed when Schiff’s daughter Frieda married Paul Warburg’sbrother Felix, another partner of Schiff’s and Paul Warburg’s.

Comingon board as secretary of the new currency committee was Van-derlip’s old friend Joseph French Johnson, now of New YorkUniversity, who had been calling for a central bank since 1900.The commission used the old Indianapolis questionnairetechnique: acquiring legitimacy by sending out a detailed ques-tionnaire on currency to a number of financial leaders. WithJohnson in charge of mailing and collating the questionnairereplies, Conant spent his time visiting and interviewing theheads of the central banks in Europe.The special commission delivered its report to the New YorkChamber of Commerce in October 1906. To eliminate instabilityand the danger of an inelastic currency, the commission calledfor the creation of a “central bank of issue under the control ofthe government.” In keeping with other bank reformers, such asProfessor Abram Piatt Andrew of Harvard University, ThomasNixon Carver of Harvard, and Albert Strauss, partner of J.P.Morgan and Company, the commission was scornful of Secre-tary Shaw’s attempt to use the Treasury as central bank. Shawwas particularly obnoxious because he was still insisting, in hislast annual report of 1906, that the Treasury, under his aegis, hadconstituted a “great central bank.” The commission, along withthe other reformers, denounced the Treasury for overinflatingby keeping interest rates excessively low; a central bank, in con-trast, would have much larger capital and undisputed controlover the money market, and thus would be able to manipulatethe discount rate effectively to keep the economy under propercontrol. The important point, declared the committee, is thatthere be “centralization of financial responsibility.” In themeantime, short of establishing a central bank, the committeeurged that, at the least, the national banks’ powers to issuenotes should be expanded to include being based on generalassets as well as government bonds.5656See Livingston, Origins, pp. 159–64."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve237After drafting and publishing this “Currency Report,” thereformers used the report as the lever for expanding the agita-tion for a central bank and broader note-issue powers to othercorporate and financial institutions. The next step was the pow-erful American Bankers Association (ABA). In 1905, the execu-tive council of the ABA had appointed a currency committeewhich, the following year, recommended an emergency assetscurrency that would be issued by a federal commission, resem-bling an embryonic central bank. In a tumultuous plenary ses-sion of the ABA convention in October 1906, the ABA rejectedthis plan, but agreed to appoint a 15-man currency commissionthat was instructed to meet with the New York chamber’s cur-rency committee and attempt to agree on appropriate legisla-tion.Particularly prominent on the ABA currency commission were:• Arthur Reynolds, president of the Des Moines NationalBank, close to the Morgan-oriented Des Moines Regency, andbrother of the prominent Chicago banker, George M. Reynolds,formerly of Des Moines and then president of the Morgan-ori-ented Continental National Bank of Chicago and the powerfulchairman of the executive council of the ABA;• James B.

Barton Hepburn,president of one of the leading Morgan commercial banks, theChase National Bank of New York, and author of the well-regarded History of Coinage and Currency in the United States. After meeting with Vanderlip and Conant as the representa-tives from the New York Chamber of Commerce committee, theABA commission, along with Vanderlip and Conant, agreed on atleast the transition demands of the reformers. The ABA commis-sion presented proposals to the public, the press, and the Con-gress in December 1906 for a broader asset currency as well asprovisions for emergency issue of bank notes by national banks.But just as sentiment for a broader asset currency becameprominent, the bank reformers began to worry about an uncon-trolled adoption of such a currency. For that would mean thatnational bank credit and notes would expand, and that, in theexisting system, small state banks would be able to pyramid andinflate credit on top of the national credit, using the expandednational bank notes as their reserves. The reformers wanted acredit inflation controlled by and confined to the large nationalbanks; they most emphatically did notwant uncontrolled statebank inflation that would siphon resources to small entrepre-neurs and “speculative” marginal producers. The problem wasaggravated by the accelerated rate of increase in the number ofsmall Southern and Western state banks after 1900. Anothergrave problem for the reformers was that commercial paper wasa different system from that of Europe. In Europe, commercialpaper, and hence bank assets, were two-name notes endorsedby a small group of wealthy acceptance banks. In contrast to thisacceptance paper system, commercial paper in the United Stateswas unendorsed single-name paper, with the bank taking achance on the creditworthiness of the business borrower. Hence,a decentralized financial system in the United States was notsubject to big-banker control."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve239Worries about the existing system and hence about uncon-trolled asset currency were voiced by the top bank reformers.Thus, Vanderlip expressed concern that “there are so many statebanks that might count these [national bank] notes in theirreserves.” Schiff warned that “it would prove unwise, if notdangerous, to clothe six thousand banks or more with the priv-ilege to issue independently a purely credit currency.” And,from the Morgan side, a similar concern was voiced by VictorMorawetz, the powerful chairman of the board of the Atchison,Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad.57Taking the lead in approaching this problem of small banksand decentralization was Paul Moritz Warburg, of Kuhn, Loeb,fresh from his banking experience in Europe. In January 1907,Warburg began what would become years of tireless agitationfor central banking with two articles: “Defects and Needs ofour Banking System” and “A Plan for a Modified CentralBank.”58Calling openly for a central bank, Warburg pointedout that one of the important functions of such a bank wouldbe to restrict the eligibility of bank assets to be used for expan-sion of bank deposits. Presumably, too, the central bank couldmove to require banks to use acceptance paper or otherwisetry to create an acceptance market in the United States.5957Livingston, Origins, pp. 168–69.58See the collection of Warburg’s essays in Paul M. Warburg, TheFederal Reserve System,2 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1930).

In that way, the Fed providedan unchecked channel for inflationary credit expansion. The acceptanceprogram helped pave the way for the 1929 crash.It was surely no accident that Warburg himself was the principal ben-eficiary of this policy.

Not only was there a general recession and contraction,but the major banks in New York and Chicago were, as in mostother depressions in American history, allowed by the govern-ment to suspend specie payments, that is, to continue in opera-tion while being relieved of their contractual obligation toredeem their notes and deposits in cash or in gold. While theTreasury had stimulated inflation during 1905–1907, there wasnothing it could do to prevent suspensions of payment, or toalleviate “the competitive hoarding of currency” after the panic,that is, the attempt to demand cash in return for increasinglyshaky bank notes and deposits.Very quickly after the panic, banker and business opinionconsolidated on behalf of a central bank, an institution thatcould regulate the economy and serve as a lender of last resortto bail banks out of trouble. The reformers now faced a twofoldtask: hammering out details of a new central bank, and moreimportant, mobilizing public opinion on its behalf. The firststep in such mobilization was to win the support of thelargest acceptance bank, as well as director of the WestinghouseAcceptance Bank and of several other acceptance houses. In 1919,Warburg was the chief founder and chairman of the executive committeeof the American Acceptance Council, the trade association of acceptancehouses. See Murray N.

The task was made easier bythe growing alliance and symbiosis between academia and thepower elite. Two organizations that proved particularly usefulfor this mobilization were the American Academy of Politicaland Social Science (AAPSS) of Philadelphia, and the Academyof Political Science (APS) of Columbia University, both of whichincluded in their ranks leading corporate liberal businessmen,financiers, attorneys, and academics. Nicholas Murray Butler,the highly influential president of Columbia University,explained that the Academy of Political Science “is an interme-diary between . . . the scholars and the men of affairs, those whomay perhaps be said to be amateurs in scholarship.” Here, hepointed out, was where they “come together.”61It is not surprising, then, that the American Academy of Polit-ical and Social Science, the American Association for theAdvancement of Science, and Columbia University held threesymposia during the winter of 1907–1908, each calling for a cen-tral bank, and thereby disseminating the message of a centralbank to a carefully selected elite public. Not surprising, too, wasthat E.R.A. Seligman was the organizer of the Columbia confer-ence, gratified that his university was providing a platform forleading bankers and financial journalists to advocate a centralbank, especially, he noted, because “it is proverbially difficult ina democracy to secure a hearing for the conclusions of experts.”Then in 1908 Seligman collected the addresses into a volume,The Currency Problem.Professor Seligman set the tone for the Columbia gatheringin his opening address. The panic of 1907, he alleged, was mod-erate because its effects had been tempered by the growth ofindustrial trusts, which provided a more controlled and “morecorrect adjustment of present investment to future needs” thanwould a “horde of small competitors.” In that way, Seligmandisplayed no comprehension of how competitive markets61Livingston, Origins, p. 175, n. 30."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"242A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIfacilitate adjustments. One big problem, however, still remainedfor Seligman. The horde of small competitors, for whom Selig-man had so much contempt, still prevailed in the field of cur-rency and banking. The problem was that the banking systemwas still decentralized. As Seligman declared, Even more important than the inelasticity of our note issue isits decentralization. The struggle which has been victori-ously fought out everywhere else [in creating trusts] must beundertaken here in earnest and with vigor.62The next address was that of Frank Vanderlip. To Vanderlip,in contrast to Seligman, the panic of 1907 was “one of the greatcalamities of history”—the result of a decentralized, competi-tive American banking system, with 15,000 banks all compet-ing vigorously for control of cash reserves. The terrible thing isthat “each institution stands alone, concerned first with its ownsafety, and using every endeavor to pile up reserves withoutregard” to the effect of such actions on other banking institu-tions. This backward system had to be changed, to follow thelead of other great nations, where a central bank is able to mobi-lize and centralize reserves, and create an elastic currency sys-tem. Putting the situation in virtually Marxian terms, Vanderlipdeclared that the alien external power of the free and competi-tive market must be replaced by central control following mod-ern, allegedly scientific principles of banking. Thomas Wheelock, editor of theWall Street Journal, then rungthe changes on the common theme by applying it to the volatilecall loan market in New York. The market is volatile, Wheelockclaimed, because the small country banks are able to lend onthat market, and their deposits in New York banks then rise andfall in uncontrolled fashion. Therefore, there must be central cor-porate control over country bank money in the call loan market.A. Barton Hepburn, head of Morgan’s Chase National Bank,came next, and spoke of the great importance of having a central62Ibid., p. 177."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve243bank that would issue a monopoly of bank notes. It was partic-ularly important that the central bank be able to discount theassets of national banks, and thus supply an elastic currency.The last speaker was Paul Warburg, who lectured his audi-ence on the superiority of European over American banking,particularly in (1) having a central bank, as against decentralizedAmerican banking, and (2)—his old hobby horse—enjoying“modern” acceptance paper instead of single-name promissorynotes. Warburg emphasized that these two institutions mustfunction together. In particular, tight government central bankcontrol must replace competition and decentralization: “Smallbanks constitute a danger.”The other two symposia were very similar. At the AAPSSsymposium in Philadelphia, in December 1907, several leadinginvestment bankers and Comptroller of the Currency William B.Ridgely came out in favor of a central bank. It was no accidentthat members of the AAPSS’s advisory committee on currencyincluded A. Barton Hepburn; Morgan attorney and statesmanElihu Root; Morgan’s longtime personal attorney, FrancisLynde Stetson; and J.P. Morgan himself. Meanwhile the AAASsymposium in January 1908 was organized by none other thanCharles A. Conant, who happened to be chairman of theAAAS’s social and economic section for the year. Speakersincluded Columbia economist J.B. Clark, Frank Vanderlip,Conant, and Vanderlip’s friend George E. Roberts, head of theRockefeller-oriented Commercial National Bank of Chicago,who would later wind up at the National City Bank.All in all, the task of the bank reformers was well summed upby J.R. Duffield, secretary of the Bankers Publishing Company,in January 1908: “It is recognized generally that before legisla-tion can be had there must be an educational campaign carriedon, first among the bankers, and later among commercial orga-nizations, and finally among the people as a whole.” That strat-egy was well under way.During the same month, the legislative lead in bankingreform was taken by the formidable Senator Nelson W."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"244A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIAldrich (R-R.I.), head of the Senate Finance Committee, and,as the father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Rockefeller’sman in the U.S. Senate. He introduced the Aldrich Bill, whichfocused on a relatively minor interbank dispute about whetherand on what basis the national banks could issue special emer-gency currency. A compromise was finally hammered out andpassed, as the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, in 1908.63 But the impor-tant part of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, which got very littlepublic attention, but was perceptively hailed by the bankreformers, was the establishment of a National MonetaryCommission that would investigate the currency question andsuggest proposals for comprehensive banking reform. Twoenthusiastic comments on the monetary commission were par-ticularly perceptive and prophetic. One was that of Sereno S.Pratt of the Wall Street Journal. Pratt virtually conceded that thepurpose of the commission was to swamp the public with sup-posed expertise and thereby “educate” them into supportingbanking reform:Reform can only be brought about by educating the peopleup to it, and such education must necessarily take muchtime. In no other way can such education be effected morethoroughly and rapidly than by means of a commission . . .[that] would make an international study of the subject andpresent an exhaustive report, which could be made the basisfor an intelligent agitation.The results of the “study” were of course predetermined, aswould be the membership of the allegedly impartial study com-mission.Another function of the commission, as stated by Festus J.Wade, St. Louis banker and member of the currency commissionof the American Bankers Association, was to “keep the financialissue out of politics” and put it squarely in the safe custody of63The emergency currency provision was only used once, shortlybefore the provision expired, in 1914, and after the establishment of theFederal Reserve System."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve245carefully selected “experts.”64Thus, the National MonetaryCommission (NMC) was the apotheosis of the clever commis-sion concept, launched in Indianapolis a decade earlier. Aldrich lost no time setting up the NMC, which waslaunched in June 1908. The official members were an equalnumber of senators and representatives, but these were merewindow dressing. The real work would be done by the copiousstaff, appointed and directed by Aldrich, who told his counter-part in the House, Cleveland Republican Theodore Burton:“My idea is, of course, that everything shall be done in the mostquiet manner possible, and without any public announce-ment.” From the beginning, Aldrich determined that the NMCwould be run as an alliance of Rockefeller, Morgan, and Kuhn,Loeb people. The two top expert posts advising or joining thecommission were both suggested by Morgan leaders. On theadvice of J.P. Morgan, seconded by Jacob Schiff, Aldrich pickedas his top adviser the formidable Henry P. Davison, Morganpartner, founder of Morgan’s Bankers Trust Company, and vicepresident of George F. Baker’s First National Bank of New York.It would be Davison who, on the outbreak of World War I,would rush to England to cement J.P. Morgan and Company’sclose ties with the Bank of England, and to receive an appoint-ment as monopoly underwriter for all British and French gov-ernment bonds to be floated in the United States for the dura-tion of the war. For technical economic expertise, Aldrichaccepted the recommendation of President Roosevelt’s closefriend and fellow Morgan man, Charles Eliot, president of Har-vard University, who urged the appointment of Harvard econ-omist A. Piatt Andrew. And an ex officio commission memberchosen by Aldrich himself was George M. Reynolds, presidentof the Rockefeller-oriented Continental National Bank ofChicago.The NMC spent the fall touring Europe and conferring oninformation and strategy with heads of large European banks64Livingston, Origins, pp. 182–83."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"246A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIand central banks. As director of research, A. Piatt Andrewbegan to organize American banking experts and to commissionreports and studies. The National City Bank’s foreign exchangedepartment was commissioned to write papers on bankers’acceptances and foreign debt, while Warburg and Bankers Trustofficial Fred Kent wrote on the European discount market.Having gathered information and advice in Europe in the fallof 1908, the NMC was ready to go into high gear by the end ofthe year. In December, the commission hired the inevitableCharles A. Conant for research, public relations, and agitprop.Behind the façade of the congressmen and senators on thecommission, Senator Aldrich began to form and expand hisinner circle, which soon included Warburg and Vanderlip. War-burg formed around him a subcircle of friends and acquain-tances from the currency committee of the New York Merchants’Association, headed by Irving T. Bush, and from the top ranksof the American Economic Association, to whom he had deliv-ered an address advocating central banking in December 1908.Warburg met and corresponded frequently with leading acade-mic economists advocating banking reform, including E.R.A.Seligman; Thomas Nixon Carver of Harvard; Henry R. Seager ofColumbia; Davis R. Dewey, historian of banking at MIT, long-time secretary-treasurer of the AEA and brother of the progres-sive philosopher John Dewey; Oliver M.W. Sprague, professorof banking at Harvard, of the Morgan-connected Sprague fam-ily; Frank W. Taussig of Harvard; and Irving Fisher of Yale.During 1909, however, the reformers faced an importantproblem: they had to bring such leading bankers as James B.Forgan, head of the Rockefeller-oriented First National Bank ofChicago, solidly into line in support of a central bank. It was notthat Forgan objected to centralized reserves or a lender of lastresort—quite the contrary. It was rather that Forgan recognizedthat, under the national banking system, large banks such as hisown were already performing quasi–central banking functionswith their own country bank depositors; and he didn’t want hisbank deprived of such functions by a new central bank."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve247The bank reformers therefore went out of their way to bringsuch men as Forgan into enthusiastic support for the newscheme. In his presidential address to the powerful AmericanBankers Association in mid-September 1909, George M.Reynolds not only came out flatly in favor of a central bank inAmerica, to be modeled after the German Reichsbank; he alsoassured Forgan and others that such a central bank would actas depository of reserves only for the large national banks inthe central reserve cities, while the national banks would con-tinue to hold deposits for the country banks. Mollified, Forganheld a private conference with Aldrich’s inner circle and camefully on board for the central bank. As an outgrowth of For-gan’s concerns, the reformers decided to cloak their new cen-tral bank in a spurious veil of “regionalism” and “decentral-ism” through establishing regional reserve centers, that wouldprovide the appearance of virtually independent regional cen-tral banks to cover the reality of an orthodox European centralbank monolith. As a result, noted railroad attorney VictorMorawetz made his famous speech in November 1909, callingfor regional banking districts under the ultimate direction of onecentral control board. Thus, reserves and note issue would besupposedly decentralized in the hands of the regional reservebanks, while they would really be centralized and coordinatedby the central control board. This, of course, was the schemeeventually adopted in the Federal Reserve System.65On September 14, at the same time as Reynolds’s address tothe nation’s bankers, another significant address took place.65Victor Morawetz was an eminent attorney in the Morgan ambit whoserved as chairman of the executive committee of the Morgan-runAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and member of the board of theMorgan-dominated National Bank of Commerce. In 1908, Morawetz,along with J.P. Morgan’s personal attorney, Francis Lynde Stetson, hadbeen the principal drafter of an unsuccessful Morgan-National CivicFederation bill for a federal incorporation law to regulate and cartelizeAmerican corporations. Later, Morawetz was to be a top consultant toanother “progressive” reformer of Woodrow Wilson’s, the Federal TradeCommission.

But the busi-ness press understood the great significance of this publicaddress, that it was, as the Wall Street Journalput it, a crucial step“toward removing the subject from the realm of theory to that ofpractical politics.”66One week later, a fateful event in American history occurred.The banking reformers moved to escalate their agitation by cre-ating a virtual government-bank-press complex to drivethrough a central bank. On September 22, 1909, the Wall StreetJournaltook the lead in this development by beginning anotable, front-page, 14-part series on “A Central Bank of Issue.”These were unsigned editorials by the Journal, but they wereactually written by the ubiquitous Charles A. Conant, from hisvantage point as salaried chief propagandist of the U.S. govern-ment’s National Monetary Commission. The series was a sum-mary of the reformers’ position, also going out of the way toassure the Forgans of this world that the new central bank“would probably deal directly only with the larger nationalbanks, leaving it for the latter to rediscount for their moreremote correspondents.”67To the standard arguments for a cen-tral bank—“elasticity” of the money supply, protecting bankreserves by manipulating the discount rate and the internationalflow of gold, and combating crisis by bailing out individualbanks—Conant added a Conant twist: the importance of regu-lating interest rates and the flow of capital in a world marked bysurplus capital. Government debt would, for Conant, providethe important function of sopping up surplus capital; that is,providing profitable outlets for savings by financing govern-ment expenditures.66Wall Street Journal,16 September 1909, p. 1.

Building on hisexperience in 1898, Conant, along with Aldrich’s secretary,Arthur B. Shelton, prepared abstracts of commission materialsfor the newspapers during February and March of 1910. SoonShelton recruited J.P. Gavitt, head of the Washington bureau ofthe Associated Press, to scan commission abstracts, articles, andforthcoming books for “newsy paragraphs” to catch the eye ofnewspaper editors.The academic organizations proved particularly helpful tothe NMC, lending their cloak of disinterested expertise to theendeavor. In February, Robert E. Ely, secretary of the APS, pro-posed to Aldrich that a special volume of its Proceedingsbedevoted to banking and currency reform, to be published incooperation with the NMC, in order to “popularize in the bestsense, some of the valuable work of [the] Commission.”68Andyet, Ely had the gall to add that, even though the APS wouldadvertise the NMC’s arguments and conclusions, it wouldretain its “objectivity” by avoiding its own specific policy rec-ommendations. As Ely put it, “We shall not advocate a centralbank, but we shall only give the best results of your work in con-densed form and untechnical language.”The AAPSS, too, weighed in with its own special volume,Banking Problems(1910), featuring an introduction by A. PiattAndrew of Harvard and the NMC and articles by veteran bankreformers such as Joseph French Johnson, Horace White, andMorgan Bankers Trust official Fred I. Kent. But most of the arti-cles were from leaders of Rockefeller’s National City Bank ofNew York, including George E.

In this way, the united reserve bank wouldcorrect the “complete lack of modern bills of exchange” (that is,acceptances) in the United States. Warburg added that the entireidea of a free and self-regulating market was obsolete, particu-larly in the money market. Instead, the action of the market mustbe replaced by “the best judgment of the best experts.” Andguess whowas slated to be one of the best of those best experts?The greatest cheerleader for the Warburg plan, and the manwho introduced the APS’sReform of the Currency (1911), the vol-ume on banking reform featuring Warburg’s speech, was War-burg’s kinsman and member of the Seligman investment bank-ing family, Columbia economist E.R.A. Seligman.69So delighted was the Merchants’ Association of New Yorkwith Warburg’s speech that it distributed 30,000 copies duringthe spring of 1910. Warburg had paved the way for this supportby regularly meeting with the currency committee of the Mer-chants’ Assocation since October 1908, and his efforts wereaided by the fact that the resident expert for that committee wasnone other than Joseph French Johnson.69See Rothbard, “Federal Reserve,” pp. 98–99.

Theobject was to swamp public opinion with a parade of impressiveanalytic and historical scholarship, all allegedly “scientific” and“value-free,” but all designed to aid in furthering the commonagenda of a central bank. Typical was E.W. Kemmerer’s mam-moth statistical study of seasonal variations in the demand formoney. Stress was laid on the problem of the “inelasticity” of thesupply of cash, in particular the difficulty of expanding that sup-ply when needed. While Kemmerer felt precluded from spellingout the policy implications—establishing a central bank—in thebook, his acknowledgments in the preface to Fred Kent and theinevitable Charles Conant were a tip-off to the cognoscenti, andKemmerer himself disclosed them in his address to the Academyof Political Science the following November.Now that the theoretical and scholarly groundwork had beenlaid, by the latter half of 1910, it was time to formulate a concretepractical plan and put on a mighty putschon its behalf. In Reformof the Currency, published by the APS, Warburg made the pointwith crystal clarity: “Advance is possible only by outlining atangible plan” that would set the terms of the debate from thenon.70The tangible plan phase of the central bank movement waslaunched by the ever pliant APS, which held a monetary con-ference in November 1910, in conjunction with the New YorkChamber of Commerce and the Merchants’ Association of NewYork. The members of the NMC were the guests of honor at thisconclave, and delegates were chosen by governors of 22 states,as well as presidents of 24 chambers of commerce. Also attend-ing were a large number of economists, monetary analysts, andrepresentatives of most of the top banks in the country. Atten-dants at the conference included Frank Vanderlip, Elihu Root,Thomas W. Lamont of the Morgans, Jacob Schiff, and J.P. Mor-gan. The formal sessions of the conference were organized70Livingston, Origins, p. 203."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIaround papers by Kemmerer, Laughlin, Johnson, Bush, War-burg, and Conant, and the general atmosphere was that bankersand businessmen were to take their general guidance from theattendant scholars. As James B. Forgan, Chicago banker whowas now solidly in the central banking camp, put it: “Let thetheorists, those who . . . can study from past history and frompresent conditions the effect of what we are doing, lay downprinciples for us, and let us help them with the details.” C. Stu-art Patterson pointed to the great lessons of the IndianapolisMonetary Commission, and the way in which its proposals tri-umphed in action because “we went home and organized anaggressive and active movement.” Patterson then laid down themarching orders of what this would mean concretely for theassembled troops: That is just what you must do in this case, you must upholdthe hands of Senator Aldrich. You have got to see that the billwhich he formulates . . . obtains the support of every part ofthis country.71With the New York monetary conference over, it was nowtime for Aldrich, surrounded by a few of the topmost leaders ofthe financial elite, to go off in seclusion and hammer out adetailed plan around which all parts of the central bank move-ment could rally. Someone in the Aldrich inner circle, probablyMorgan partner Henry P. Davison, got the idea of convening asmall group of top leaders in a super-secret conclave to draft thecentral bank bill. On November 22, 1910, Senator Aldrich, witha handful of companions, set forth in a privately chartered rail-road car from Hoboken, New Jersey, to the coast of Georgia,where they sailed to an exclusive retreat, the Jekyll Island Clubon Jekyll Island, Georgia. Facilities for their meeting werearranged by club member and co-owner J.P. Morgan. The coverstory released to the press was that this was a simple duck-hunting expedition, and the conferees took elaborate precau-tions on the trips there and back to preserve their secrecy. Thus,71Ibid., pp. 205–07."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve253the attendees addressed each other only by first name, and therailroad car was kept dark and closed off from reporters orother travelers on the train. One reporter apparently caught onto the purpose of the meeting, but was in some way persuadedby Henry P. Davison to maintain silence. The conferees worked for a solid week at Jekyll Island tohammer out the draft of the Federal Reserve bill. In addition toAldrich, the conferees included Henry P. Davison, Morganpartner; Paul Warburg, whose address in the spring had greatlyimpressed Aldrich; Frank A. Vanderlip, vice president of theNational City Bank of New York; and finally, A. Piatt Andrew,head of the NMC staff, who had recently been made assistantsecretary of the Treasury by President Taft. After a week ofmeetings, the six men had forged a plan for a central bank,which eventually became the Aldrich Bill. Vanderlip acted assecretary of the meeting, and contributed the final writing.The only substantial disagreement was tactical, withAldrich attempting to hold out for a straightforward centralbank on the European model, while Warburg and the otherbankers insisted that the reality of central control be cloaked inthe politically palatable camouflage of “decentralization.” It isamusing that the bankers were the more politically astute,while the politician Aldrich wanted to waive political consid-erations. Warburg and the bankers won out, and the final draftwas basically the Warburg plan with a decentralized patinataken from Morawetz.The financial power elite now had a bill. The significance ofthe composition of the small meeting must be stressed: twoRockefeller men (Aldrich and Vanderlip), two Morgans (Davisonand Norton), one Kuhn, Loeb person (Warburg), and one econo-mist friendly to both camps (Andrew).7272See Rothbard, “Federal Reserve,” pp. 99–101; and Frank A.Vanderlip, From Farm Boy to Financier(New York: D.

Instead of quickly present-ing this Aldrich Bill to the Congress, its drafters waited for a fullyear, until January 1912. Why the unprecedented year’s delay?The problem was that the Democrats swept the congres-sional elections in 1910, and Aldrich, disheartened, decided notto run for re-election to the Senate the following year. TheDemocratic triumph meant that the reformers had to devote ayear of intensive agitation to convert the Democrats, and tointensify propaganda to the rest of banking, business, and thepublic. In short, the reformers needed to regroup and acceleratetheir agitation.THEFINALPHASE: COPING WITH THEDEMOCRATICASCENDANCYThe final phase of the drive for a central bank began in Jan-uary 1911. At the previous January’s meeting of the NationalBoard of Trade, Paul Warburg had put through a resolutionsetting aside January 18, 1911, as a “monetary day” devoted toa “Business Men’s Monetary Conference.” This conference,run by the National Board of Trade, and featuring delegatesfrom metropolitan mercantile organizations from all over thecountry, had C. Stuart Patterson as its chairman. The New YorkChamber of Commerce, the Merchants’ Association of NewYork, and the New York Produce Exchange, each of which hadbeen pushing for banking reform for the previous five years,introduced a joint resolution to the monetary conference sup-porting the Aldrich Plan, and proposing the establishment ofa new “businessmen’s monetary reform league” to lead thepublic struggle for a central bank. After a speech in favor ofthe plan by A. Piatt Andrew, the entire conference adopted theresolution. In response, C. Stuart Patterson appointed noneother than Paul M. Warburg to head a committee of seven toestablish the reform league."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve255The committee of seven shrewdly decided, following the leadof the old Indianapolis convention, to establish the National Cit-izens’ League for the Creation of a Sound Banking System inChicago rather than in New York, where the control reallyresided. The idea was to acquire the bogus patina of a “grass-roots” heartland operation and to convince the public that theleague was free of dreaded Wall Street control. As a result, theofficial heads of the league were Chicago businessmen John V.Farwell and Harry A. Wheeler, president of the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce. The director was University of Chicago monetaryeconomist J. Laurence Laughlin, assisted by his former student,Professor H. Parker Willis.In keeping with its Midwestern aura, most of the directors ofthe Citizens’ League were Chicago nonbanker industrialists:men such as B.E. Sunny of the Chicago Telephone Company,Cyrus McCormick of International Harvester (both companiesin the Morgan ambit), John G. Shedd of Marshall Field andCompany, Frederic A. Delano of the Wabash Railroad Company(Rockefeller-controlled), and Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roe-buck. Over a decade later, however, H. Parker Willis franklyconceded that the Citizens’ League had been a propagandaorgan of the nation’s bankers.73The Citizens’ League swung into high gear during the springand summer of 1911, issuing a periodical, Banking and Reform,designed to reach newspaper editors, and subsidizing pam-phlets by such pro-reform experts as John Perrin, head of theAmerican National Bank of Indianapolis, and George E. Robertsof the National City Bank of New York. Consultant on the news-paper campaign was H.H. Kohlsaat, former executive commit-tee member of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention.

The first step was to convert thebanking elite. For that purpose, the Aldrich inner circle orga-nized a closed-door conference of 23 top bankers in Atlantic Cityin early February, which included several members of the cur-rency commission of the American Bankers Association (ABA),along with bank presidents from nine leading cities of the coun-try. After making a few minor revisions, the conference warmlyendorsed the Aldrich Plan.After this meeting, Chicago banker James B. Forgan, presi-dent of the Rockefeller-dominated First National Bank ofChicago, emerged as the most effective banker spokesman forthe central bank movement. Not only was his presentation ofthe Aldrich Plan before the executive council of the ABA in Mayconsidered particularly impressive, it was especially effectivecoming from someone who had been a leading critic (if on rela-tively minor grounds) of the plan. As a result, the top bankersmanaged to get the ABA to violate its own bylaws and makeForgan chairman of its executive council.At the Atlantic City conference, James Forgan had succinctlyexplained the purpose of the Aldrich Plan and of the conferenceitself. As Kolko sums up:the real purpose of the conference was to discuss winningthe banking community over to government control directlyby the bankers for their own ends. . . . It was generallyappreciated that the [Aldrich Plan] would increase thepower of the big national banks to compete with the rapidlygrowing state banks, help bring the state banks under con-trol, and strengthen the position of the national banks in for-eign banking activities.74By November 1911, it was easy pickings to have the fullAmerican Bankers Association endorse the Aldrich Plan. The74Kolko, Triumph, p. 186."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Origins of the Federal Reserve257nation’s banking community was now solidly lined up behindthe drive for a central bank.However, 1912 and 1913 were years of some confusion andbacking and filling, as the Republican Party split between itsinsurgents and regulars, and the Democrats won increasing con-trol over the federal government, culminating in Woodrow Wil-son’s gaining the presidency in the November 1912 elections.The Aldrich Plan, introduced into the Senate by Theodore Bur-ton in January 1912, died a quick death, but the reformers sawthat what they had to do was to drop the fiercely Republicanpartisan name of Aldrich from the bill, and with a few minoradjustments, rebaptize it as a Democratic measure. Fortunatelyfor the reformers, this process of transformation was easedgreatly in early 1912, when H. Parker Willis was appointedadministrative assistant to Carter Glass, the Democrat from Vir-ginia who now headed the House Banking and Currency Com-mittee. In an accident of history, Willis had taught economics tothe two sons of Carter Glass at Washington and Lee University,and they recommended him to their father when the Democratsassumed control of the House.The minutiae of the splits and maneuvers in the bankingreform camp during 1912 and 1913, which have long fascinatedhistorians, are fundamentally trivial to the basic story. Theylargely revolved around the successful efforts by Laughlin,Willis, and the Democrats to jettison the name Aldrich. More-over, while the bankers had preferred the Federal ReserveBoard to be appointed by the bankers themselves, it was clearto most of the reformers that this was politically unpalatable.They realized that the same result of a government-coordi-nated cartel could be achieved by having the president andCongress appoint the board, balanced by the bankers electingmost of the officials of the regional Federal Reserve Banks, andelecting an advisory council to the Fed. However, much woulddepend on whom the president would appoint to the board.The reformers did not have to wait long.

The reformers had gotten the point by the end of con-gressional wrangling over the Glass bill, and by the time theFederal Reserve Act was passed in December 1913, the billenjoyed overwhelming support from the banking community.As A. Barton Hepburn of the Chase National Bank persua-sively told the American Bankers Association at its annualmeeting of August 1913: “The measure recognizes and adoptsthe principles of a central bank. Indeed . . . it will make allincorporated banks together joint owners of a central dominat-ing power.”75In fact, there was very little substantive differ-ence between the Aldrich and Glass bills: the goal of the bankreformers had been triumphantly achieved.76, 77CONCLUSIONThe financial elites of this country, notably the Morgan, Rock-efeller, and Kuhn, Loeb interests, were responsible for puttingthrough the Federal Reserve System, as a governmentally cre-ated and sanctioned cartel device to enable the nation’s banks toinflate the money supply in a coordinated fashion, without suf-fering quick retribution from depositors or noteholdersdemanding cash.

In particular, American politics in this periodwas marked by a fierce struggle between two major financial-industrial groupings: the interests clustered around the Houseof Morgan on the one hand, and an alliance of Rockefeller (oil),Harriman (railroad), and Kuhn, Loeb (investment banking)interests on the other. The Morgans began in investment bank-ing, and moved out into railroads, commercial banking, andthen manufacturing; the Rockefeller–Harriman–Kuhn, Loeballiance began in their three respective original spheres, andmoved into commercial banking. In most instances, the twomighty combines clashed: for example, in whether or notTheodore Roosevelt (always closely allied to the Morgans)should use the antitrust weapon to smash Standard Oil, orwhether, in his turn, President Taft (allied with the Ohio-basedRockefellers) should try to break up Morgan trusts such asInternational Harvester or United States Steel.

The secret meet-ing of a handful of top bankers at the Jekyll Island Club inNovember 1910 that framed the prototype of the FederalReserve Act was held at a resort facility provided by J.P. Morganhimself. The Federal Reserve, in its first two decades, containedtwo loci of power: the main one was the head, then called thegovernor, of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; of lesserimportance was the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Thegovernor of the New York Fed from the beginning until hisdeath in 1928, was Benjamin Strong, who had spent his entireworking life in the Morgan ambit. He was a vice president of theBankers Trust Company, established by the Morgans to engagein the new and lucrative trust business; and his best friends inthe world were his mentor and neighbor, the powerful Morganpartner Henry P. Davison, as well as two other Morgan part-ners, Dwight Morrow and Thomas W. Lamont. So highlytrusted was Strong in the Morgan circle that he was brought into be the personal auditor of J. Pierpont Morgan, Sr., during thepanic of 1907. When he was offered the post of governor of theNew York Fed in the new Federal Reserve System, the reluctantStrong was convinced by Davison that he could operate the Fedas a “real central bank . . . run from New York.”2264A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II1On the National Civic Federation, see James Weinstein, The CorporateIdeal in the Liberal State, 1900–1918(Boston: Beacon Press, 1968).2So close were Strong and Davison that, when Strong’s wife committedsuicide after childbirth, Davison took the three surviving children into hishome.

The other was Amherst classmateand prominent Morgan partner Dwight Morrow. Morrowbegan to agitate for Coolidge for president as early as 1919, andcontinued his pressure at the Chicago Republican convention of1920. Dwight Morrow and fellow Morgan partner ThomasCochran lobbied strenuously for Coolidge at Chicago. Cochran,who was not an Amherst graduate, did not have the Amherstexcuse for working for Coolidge, and so he kept in the back-ground.

President CalvinCoolidge, friend and protégé of Morgan partner Dwight Mor-row, was deeply admired by J.P. “Jack” Morgan, Jr. Jack Mor-gan saw the president, perhaps uniquely, as a rare blend ofdeep thinker and moralist. Morgan wrote a friend: “I havenever seen any president who gives me just the feeling of con-fidence in the country and its institutions, and the working outof our problems, that Mr. Coolidge does.”On the other hand, the House of Morgan faced the happydilemma in the 1924 presidential election that the Democraticcandidate was none other than John W. Davis, senior partner ofthe Wall Street firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, and chiefattorney for J.P. Morgan and Company. Davis, a protégé of thelegendary Morgan partner Harry Davison, was also a personalfriend and a backgammon and cribbage partner of Jack Mor-gan’s. It was an embarrassment of riches. Whoever won the1924 election, the Morgans could not lose, although theydecided to opt for Coolidge.76Morgan partner Dwight Morrow became ambassador to Mexico in1927, while Nicaraguan affairs came under the direction of Henry L.Stimson, Wall Street lawyer and longtime leading disciple of Elihu Root,and a partner in Root’s law firm.

Their prime goal was to induce their belovedpresident to break precedent and run for a third term. Notbeing able to persuade Coolidge, the Morgans next turned toVice President Charles G.

When Dawesdropped out of the race, the Morgans turned at last to HerbertClark Hoover, who had been a powerful secretary of com-merce during the two Republican administrations of the1920s.

This particular Adamsdaughter had been fortunate enough to marry Jack Morgan.Benjamin Strong’s monetary policy, throughout his reign,was essentially a Morgan policy. The Morgans, through theirsubsidiary, Morgan, Grenfell in London, had long been inti-mately associated with the British government and with theBank of England. Before World War I, the House of Morgan hadbeen named a fiscal agent of the British Treasury and of theBank of England. After the war began, the Morgans became thesole purchaser of all goods and supplies for the British andFrench war effort in the United States, as well as the monopolyunderwriter in the United States of all British and French bonds.The Morgans played a substantial role in bringing the UnitedStates into the war on Britain’s side, and, as head of the Fed,Benjamin Strong obligingly doubled the money supply tofinance America’s role in the war effort.11After the end of the war, Strong’s monetary policy was delib-erately guided by the prime objective of helping Great Britainestablish, and impose upon Europe, a new and disastrous gold-exchange standard. The idea was to restore “England”—whichreally meant the Morgans’ English associates and allies—to herold position of financial dominance by helping her establish aphony gold standard. Ostensibly this was a return to the prewar“classical” gold standard.

Unfortunately,however, Hoover was in favor of a different form of easy moneyand cheap credit. When he became president, he tried, like KingCanute, to hold back the tides by continuing to generate cheapbank credit, and then using “moral suasion” to exhort banksand other lenders notto lend money for the purchase of stock.Hoover suffered from the fallacious view that industrial creditwas productive and “legitimate” while financial, stock marketcredit was “unproductive.” Moreover, he believed that valuablecapital funds somehow got lost, or “absorbed,” in the stockmarket and therefore became lost to productive credit. Hooveremployed methods of intimidation of business that had beenhoned when he was food czar in World War I and then secretaryof commerce, now trying to get banks to restrain stock marketloans and to induce the New York Stock Exchange to curb spec-ulation. Roy Young, Hoover’s new appointee as governor of the"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"272A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIFederal Reserve Board, suffered from the same fallacious view.Partly responsible for the Hoover administration’s adoptingthis policy was the wily manipulator Montagu Norman, head ofthe Bank of England, and close friend of the late BenjaminStrong, who had persuaded Strong to inflate credit in order tohelp England’s disastrous gold-exchange policy. Norman, itmight be added, was very close to the Morgan, Grenfell bank.By June 1929, it was clear that the absurd policy of moral sua-sion had failed. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, Normanswitched, and persuaded the Fed to resume its old policy ofinflating reserves through subsidizing the acceptance market bypurchasing all acceptances offered at a subsidized rate—a pol-icy the Fed had abandoned in the spring of 1928.13Despite this attempt to keep the boom going, however, themoney supply in the United States leveled off by the end of1928, and remained more or less constant from then on. Thisending of the massive credit expansion boom made a recessioninevitable, and sure enough, the American economy began toturn down in July 1929. Feverish attempts to keep the stockmarket boom going, however, managed to boost stock priceswhile the economic fundamentals were turning sour, leading tothe famous stock market crash of October 24.This crash was an event for which Herbert Hoover wasready. For a decade, Herbert Hoover had urged that the UnitedStates break its age-old policy of not intervening in cyclicalrecessions. During the postwar 1920–1921 recession, Hoover, assecretary of commerce, had unsuccessfully urged PresidentHarding to intervene massively in the recession, to “do some-thing” to cure the depression, in particular to expand credit and13See A.

Although theUnited States got out of the recession on its own, without mas-sive intervention, Hoover vowed that next time it would be dif-ferent. In late 1928, after he was elected president, Hoover pre-sented a public works scheme, the “Hoover Plan” for“permanent prosperity,” for a pact to “outlaw depression,” tothe Conference of Governors. Hoover had adopted the schemeof the well-known inflationists Foster and Catchings, for amammoth $3 billion public-works plan to “stabilize” businesscycles. William T. Foster was the theoretician and WaddillCatchings the financier of the duo; Foster was installed as headof the Pollak Foundation for Economic Research by Catchings,iron and steel magnate and investment banker at the powerfulWall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs.14When the stock market crash came in October 1929, there-fore, President Hoover was ready for massive intervention toattempt to raise wage rates, expand credit, and embark on pub-lic works. Hoover himself recalls that he was the very first pres-ident to consider himself responsible for economic prosperity:“therefore, we had to pioneer a new field.” Hoover’s admiringbiographers correctly state that “President Hoover was the firstpresident in our history to offer federal leadership in mobilizingthe economic resources of the people.” Hoover recalls it was a“program unparalleled in the history of depressions.”15Themajor opponent of this new statist dogma was Secretary of theTreasury Mellon, who, though one of the leaders in pushing theboom, now at least saw the importance of liquidating the mal-investments, inflated costs, prices, and wage rates of the infla-tionary boom. Mellon, indeed, correctly cited the successfulapplication of such a laissez-faire policy in previous recessions14William T.

But Hoover overrode Mellon, with the support ofTreasury Undersecretary Ogden Mills.If Hoover stood ready to impose an expansionist and inter-ventionist New Deal, Morgan man George L. Harrison, head ofthe New York Fed and major power in the Federal Reserve, wasall the more ready to inflate. During the week of the crash, thelast week of October, the Fed doubled its holdings of govern-ment securities, adding $150 million to bank reserves, as well asdiscounting $200 million more for member banks. The idea wasto prevent liquidation of the bloated stock market, and to permitthe New York City banks to take over the loans to stockbrokersthat the nonbank lenders were liquidating. As a result, memberbanks of the Federal Reserve expanded their deposits by $1.8billion—a phenomenal monetary expansion of nearly 10 per-cent in one week! Of this increase, $1.6 billion were increaseddeposits of the New York City banks. In addition, Harrisondrove down interest rates, lowering its discount rates to banksfrom 6 percent to 4.5 percent in a few weeks.Harrison conducted these actions with a will, overriding theobjections of Federal Reserve Board Governor Roy Young, pro-claiming that “the Stock Exchange should stay open at all costs,”and announcing, “Gentlemen, I am ready to provide all thereserve funds that may be needed.”16By mid-November, the great stock break was over, and themarket, artificially buoyed and stimulated by expanding credit,began to move upward again. With the stock market emergencyseemingly over, bank reserves were allowed to decline, by theend of November, by about $275 million, to just about the levelbefore the crash. By the end of the year, total bank reserves at$2.35 billion were almost exactly the same as they had been theday before the crash, or at the end of November, with total bankdeposits increasing slightly during this period. But while theaggregates of factors determining reserves were the same, theirdistribution was very different.

In short, the Fed tried itsbest to inflate a great deal more, but its expansionary policy waspartially thwarted by increasing caution and by withdrawal ofmoney from the banking system by the general public.Here we see, at the very beginning of the Hoover era, the spu-riousness of the monetarist legend that the Federal Reserve wasresponsible for the great contraction of money from 1929 to 1933.On the contrary, the Fed and the administration tried their bestto inflate, efforts foiled by the good sense, and by the increasingdistrust of the banking system, of the American people.At any rate, even though the Fed had not managed to inflatethe money supply further, President Hoover was proud of hisexperiment in cheap money, and of the Fed’s massive open mar-ket purchases. In a speech to a conference of industrial leadershe had called together in Washington on December 5, the presi-dent hailed the nation’s good fortune in possessing the splendidFederal Reserve System, which had succeeded in saving shakybanks, restoring confidence, and making capital more abundantby lowering interest rates. Hoover had personally done his partby urging banks to discount more at the Fed, while SecretaryMellon reverted to his old Pollyanna mode in assuring one andall that there was “plenty of credit available.” Hoover admirerWilliam Green, head of the American Federation of Labor, pro-claimed that the “Federal Reserve System is operating, servingas a barrier against financial demoralization. Within a fewmonths industrial conditions will become normal, confidenceand stabilization in industry and finance will be restored.”17By the end of 1929, Roy Young and other Fed officialsfavored pursuing a laissez-faire policy “to let the money market17Rothbard, America’s Great Depression, pp. 192–93."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"276A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II‘sweat it out’ and reach monetary ease by the wholesomeprocess of liquidation.”18Once again, however, Harrison and theNew York Fed overruled Washington, and instituted a massiveeasy-money program. Discount rates of the New York Fed fellfrom 4.5 percent in February to 2 percent at the end of 1930.Other short-term interest rates fell similarly. Once again, theNew York Fed led the inflationist parade by purchasing $218million of government securities during the year; the resultingincrease of $116 million in bank reserves, however, was offset bybank failures in the latter part of the year, and by enforced con-traction on the part of the shaky banks remaining in business. Asa result, total money supply remained constant throughout 1930.Expansion was also cut short by the fact that the stock marketboomlet early in the year had collapsed by the spring.During the year, however, Montagu Norman was able toachieve part of his long-standing wish for formal collaborationbetween the world’s major central banks. Norman pushedthrough a new central bankers’ bank, the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS), to meet regularly at Basle, and to provide reg-ular facilities for cooperation. While the suspicious Congressforbade the Fed from joining the BIS formally, the New York Fedand its allied Morgan interests were able to work closely withthe new bank. The BIS, indeed, treated the New York Fed as if itwere the central bank of the United States. Gates W. McGarrahresigned as chairman of the board of the New York Fed in Feb-ruary to assume the position of president of the BIS, while Jack-son E. Reynolds, a director of the New York Fed particularlyclose to the Morgan interests, became chairman of the BIS’sorganizing committee.19Unsurprisingly, J.P. Morgan and Com-pany supplied much of the capital for the new BIS. And eventhough there was no legislative sanction for U.S. participation in18Benjamin M.

Professor H. Parker Willis, a tire-less critic of the Fed’s inflationism and credit expansion,attacked the current easy money policy of the Fed in an editorialin the New York Journal of Commerce.21Willis pointed out that theFed’s easy-money policy was actually bringing about the rash ofbank failures, because of the banks’ “inability to liquidate” theirunsound loans and assets. Willis noted that the country was suf-fering from frozen wasteful malinvestments in plants, buildings,and other capital, and maintained that the depression could onlybe cured when these unsound credit positions were allowed toliquidate. Similarly, Albert Wiggin, head of Chase NationalBank, clearly reflecting the courageous and uncompromisingviews of the Chase bank’s chief economist, Dr. Benjamin M.Anderson, denounced the Hoover policy of propping up wage20Rothbard, America’s Great Depression, p. 332.21Willis, professor of banking at Columbia University and editor ofthe Journal of Commerce, had been a student of the great hard-money econ-omist J.

ParkerWillis, in the 1920s and 1930s, was a tireless and perceptive critic of the infla-tionary policies of the Fed, whether in boom or depression.

It is true, however,that Meyer’s brother-in-law, George Blumenthal, had left thispost at Lazard to be a high official in J.P. Morgan and Company,and that Meyer himself had once acted as a liaison between theMorgans and the French government.24By the 1920s, Meyer’smajor financial base was his control of the mighty integratedchemical firm, Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation.25Before World War I, Meyer’s major financial involvementhad been with the Guggenheims and the copper industry. By1910, he was so prominent in the copper industry that he wasable to arrange a cartel agreement between his old patrons, theGuggenheims, and Anaconda Copper, each agreeing to cut itsproduction by 7.5 percent. In the same year, Meyer discoveredin London a highly productive and profitable new process formining copper, and was quickly able to become its franchiser inthe United States.2624It is also true that Meyer was never particularly close to Blumenthal.Merlo J.

Meyer was astute enough to discover and finance a new dye-mak-ing process invented by a struggling chemist and German dye salesman,Dr. William Beckers, and Meyer quickly set up the Beckers Aniline andChemical Works to sell dyes to the woolen industry. In 1916, Meyerbrought about a merger with another new dye firm selling to the cottonindustry, and with the supplier of aniline oil to both companies, formingthe National Aniline and Chemical Company. Meyer eventually seizedcontrol of National Aniline and Chemical, which made heavy profits dur-ing the war selling blue dyes to the Navy. After the war, Meyer engi-neered the merger of National Aniline with companies making acids,alkalis, coke ovens, chemical by-products, and coal-tars, to form the pow-erful and highly profitable Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation onJanuary 1, 1921.

The nonferrous metals unitincluded copper, lead, zinc, antimony, aluminum, nickel, andsilver. When the War Industries Board took over the task of col-lectivist planning of industry in August 1917, Meyer assumedthe same task there—and was also to become the virtual “czar”of the copper industry.27More important for his eventual role in the Hoover adminis-tration was Meyer’s crucial part in the War Finance Corporation(WFC). The WFC had been set up by Secretary of the TreasuryMcAdoo in May 1918, ostensibly to finance industries essentialto the war effort. Meyer was named the WFC’s managing direc-tor. The WFC massively subsidized American industry. Duringthe war, it had two basic functions. One was acting as agent ofthe Treasury to prop up the market for U.S. government bonds.During the last six months of the war, Meyer spent $378 millionto keep government bonds from falling by more than one-quar-ter point a day, and later resold the bonds to the Treasury at thecost of purchase.The second and dominant function of the WFC was to subsi-dize and bail out firms and industries in trouble, allegedly“essential” to the war effort. The WFC began with an author-ized capital of $500 million supplied by the Treasury, and withthe power to borrow up to $3 billion through the issue of bonds.Its major focus was on utilities, railroads, and the banks thathad financed them. Banks were also under strain because manyof their savings deposits had been drawn down to help finance27On the Council of National Defense and the War Industries Board,see Murray N.

All in all, during the war, the WFC madeloans of $71 million, in addition to its bond-price operations.It was clear that the essential mission of the WFC acted as acamouflage for a government subsidy operation. As Meyer’sapproving biographer writes: “The WFC had been created as arescue mission for essential war-disrupted industries, andMeyer had shaped it into a powerful instrument of public pol-icy.”28If the WFC, and for that matter the rest of the apparatus ofwar collectivism, had been strictly war-related, they all wouldhave been dropped swiftly as soon as the Armistice was signedon November 11, 1918. But on the contrary, Baruch, Meyer, theWar Industries Board, and most business leaders were anxiousto continue the benefits of collectivism indefinitely after the warwas over. The goals were twofold: price controls to keep pricesup during the expected postwar recession; and a permanentpeacetime cartelization of American industry enforced by thefederal government. Permanent cartelization was endorsed bythe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and by the National Associa-tion of Manufacturers. President Wilson, however, prompted bySecretary of War Newton D. Baker, insisted on scuttling the WIBby the end of 1918. Other aspects of wartime government inter-ventionism continued on, however, not the least of which wasthe War Finance Corporation.29The War Finance Corporation was a striking example of awartime government agency that refused to die.

Hence, theMorgans urged their friends in the Treasury Department to usethe WFC to provide credits to finance American exports, specif-ically to pay American exporters and then collect the moneyfrom foreign importers. While the Wilson administration didnot want a permanent government loan program, it persuadedCongress to extend the WFC in March 1919 and to authorize itto lend up to $1 billion over five years to American exportersand to American banks that made export loans.30Particularlyardent in pressuring Congress was WFC head Eugene Meyer,who had been gravely disappointed when the Wilson adminis-tration scuttled the War Industries Board.31Meyer happily plunged into making and encouragingexport loans and, while in Europe for the peace conference, hetried unsuccessfully to pressure British banks into issuing $600million in loans to finance British imports, and to keep theovervalued pound from falling to its market levels. To counterthe dangerously inflationary postwar boom, President Wilsonshifted David F. Houston from the post of agriculture secretaryto Treasury secretary, and Houston boldly set about shiftingAmerica to a more laissez-faire and deflationary course. Meyerworked feverishly to keep the inflationary boom going, theWFC approving loans totaling $150 million to finance theexports of cotton, tobacco, copper, coal, and steel.

Sapiro was a high-priced young attorney for several California farm co-ops whoconcocted grandiose plans for voluntary price-raising cartelsin cotton, wheat, tobacco, and other crops, all of which turnedout to be failures.34By the summer of 1923, the WFC hadloaned $172 million to farm co-ops and another $182 million torural banks, which in turn loaned money to farmers. TheWFC, working closely with farm bloc leaders, appointed aCorn Belt Advisory Committee of farm leaders to pressureMidwestern rural bankers into lending more heavily to farm-ers in that region.With banks providing a steady flow of short-term farmloans, and a vast Federal Farm Loan system, established inJuly 1916, supplying plentiful mortgage loans, the farm blocstill felt a gap in unsubsidized intermediate-term credit.Meyer and the co-op interests duly introduced a bill intoCongress calling for a system of privately capitalized agri-cultural credit corporations, with the Federal Reserveempowered to extend credits and support these corpora-tions. But the farm bloc, supported by Secretary of Com-merce Hoover and Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wal-lace, went further, backing a competing bill establishing alarge governmentally capitalized system of Federal Interme-diate Credit Banks, patterned after the Federal Reserve Sys-tem and governed by the Federal Farm Loan Board (FFLB),which had already been established to run the Farm LoanSystem. Congress passed both bills in one Agricultural Cred-its Act of 1923 in the summer of that year, but the Meyer sys-tem was in effect a dead letter; how could a privatelyfinanced albeit subsidized credit system compete with onefinanced by the U.S. Treasury?34Rothbard, America’s Great Depression, pp. 199–200."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"286A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIWith WFC duties now assumed by the new Federal Inter-mediate Credit system, Eugene Meyer allowed the WarFinance Corporation’s authority to make loans expire at theend of 1924.

The Morgans were even more interested thanMeyer in bailing out the European banking systems. In lateJune 1931, the New York Fed agreed to participate with theBank of England, the Bank of France, and the Bank for Inter-national Settlements in a $100 million loan to try to bail out theGerman Reichsbank. Soon the Germans were asking for $500million more to save their banking system. While Harrisonwas sympathetic, Meyer and the other bankers felt this wastoo much of a long-term commitment. The German govern-ment then asked the Fed, not only for the extra loan, but also35Pusey, Eugene Meyer, pp. 183–92; Rothbard, America’s Great Depression,pp. 196–98; and James Stuart Olson, Herbert Hoover and the ReconstructionFinance Corporation, 1931–1933(Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1977),p. 12."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 287The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elitesfor a reassuring statement—clearly mendacious—hailing the“fundamental soundness” of the German economy. Happen-ing to be in New York in the midst of this German crisis on theweekend of July 12, Meyer found out by accident of a secretmeeting at the New York Fed on the crisis with the top Mor-gan people in the administration, including Morgan partnersRussell Leffingwell and S. Parker Gilbert; Albert Wiggin, headof the Morgan-run Chase National Bank; Acting Treasury Sec-retary Ogden Mills; Owen D. Young, chairman of the Morgan-run General Electric, and from the New York Fed, GovernorGeorge Harrison and Deputy Governor W. Randolph Burgess.The meeting had already persuaded President Hoover to issuea statement of sympathy for the German situation. Meyer, atthis point, went ballistic, insisting that the president’s state-ment, backed by a meeting of top banking worthies, would betaken by the Germans as well as everyone else as a “moralcommitment to help the Germans,” which would either leadto a disastrous blank-check support for German finance, orwould make matters worse when that support was repudi-ated. Meyer also insisted that only the Federal Reserve Boardin Washington could legally commit the Fed to such action. Byhis last-minute intervention, Meyer was fortunately able toblock the Morgan cabal from getting Hoover to make the pub-lic endorsement. The following week, Hoover, aided by vet-eran Morgan-oriented lawyer and Secretary of State Henry L.Stimson, agitated again for direct loans to Germany, butMeyer was able to confine Hoover to engineering a Meyer-approved big power “standstill agreement” by which banksthroughout the major countries of the world would continueto hold German and other Central European short-term debtswithout trying to get out of German marks and other shakycurrencies of that region.Generally, Meyer was able to overrule Harrison.

There was one differ-ence: whereas Meyer and the bankers wanted a revival of theWar Finance Corporation for government to pour in the newmoney directly, Hoover first wanted to try a dab of his charac-teristic government-business partnership to encourage privatebankers to contribute the necessary hundreds of millions of dol-lars to a federal agency. Hoover set up his National Credit Cor-poration (NCC) to attract $500 million from the banks in orderto shore up shaky individual banks. But when the NationalCredit Corporation was only able to raise $150 million,Hoover quickly and cheerfully threw in the towel, and by theend of November, agreed to introduce a bill into Congress torevive the old WFC and expand it for peacetime uses into anew Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC).37The RFC bill, which sailed through Congress by late January1932, provided for the Treasury to pour $500 million of capitalinto the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which wasempowered to issue securities up to an additional $1.5 billion.The RFC could make loans to banks and financial institutions ofall types.

This was the doctrine trumpeted byPresident Hoover, Meyer, Mills, and Undersecretary of the Trea-sury Arthur A. Ballantine, a partner of the law firm headed bylongtime Morgan attorney Elihu Root. Unsurprisingly, the repre-sentatives of groups expecting a massive infusion of federalmoney—commercial banks, savings banks, life insurance com-panies, and building and loan (in later years, savings andloan) associations—testifying before Congress “all praised the[RFC] bill in glowing terms, claiming that it was essential tothe survival of the money market.” In addition, the RFC wasempowered to lend money to railroads, in order to relieve theirindebtedness and revivify the railroad bond market. The rail-road representatives were also delighted with the bill.Hoover’s original bill was even more sweeping, alsoallowing the RFC to make business loans to “bona fide insti-tutions,” but the Senate Democrats, suspicious of excessiveexecutive power over business, killed this proposal. The Sen-ate Democrats also reportedly extracted a promise fromHoover to make the beloved Eugene Meyer chairman of thenew RFC. Meyer, doing double duty as governor of the Fed-eral Reserve Board andhead of the RFC, was now the mostpowerful single economic and financial force in the federalgovernment.The RFC, at the Democrats’ insistence, was to have a boardof directors consisting of four Republicans and three Democ-rats. Three of the Republicans were the ex officio heads of theFederal Reserve Board (Chairman Meyer), the secretary of theTreasury (Ogden Mills, who had replaced Mellon in January),and of the Federal Farm Loan Board (Paul Bestor, Meyer’s pro-tégé and successor).

Like the War Finance Corporation, the RFC estab-lished eight divisions, as well as 33 local loan agencies.Each of these loan agencies established an advisory commit-tee consisting of the leading local bankers to scrutinize and passon loan applications. This arrangement placed tremendouspolitical and financial power into the hands of local bankersarmed with federal power. Moreover, the ReconstructionFinance Corporation was not required to reveal the names ofborrowers or the amounts of its loans to Congress or to the pub-lic. A tremendous political and economic power was thusplaced in the RFC and bankers associated with it. Even pro-gressive Senator George Norris of Nebraska lamented that hehad never envisioned “putting the government into business asfar as this bill would put it.”Hoover and his associates rationalized this power as being atemporary necessity to handle an emergency, supposedly muchlike World War I, when the prototype of the RFC had beenestablished. Thus, Hoover repeatedly spoke of fighting thedepression as the equivalent of fighting a war: We are engaged in a fight upon a hundred fronts just as pos-itive, just as definite, and requiring just as greatly the moralcourage, the organized action, the unity of strength, and thesense of devotion in every community as in war. Eugene Meyer spoke repeatedly in military metaphors, andSecretary Mills spoke of the “great war against depression . . .being fought on many fronts,” especially the “long battle . . . tocarry our financial structure through the worldwide collapse.”And so too did business and financial leaders rationalizetheir hasty embrace of collectivism in the ReconstructionFinance Corporation.

The articleadded:The answer made by representatives of business to the charge ofsocialism is that in all great emergencies, war for example, gov-ernments have always thrown themselves into the breach, becauseonly they can organize and mobilize the whole strength of thenation. In war every country becomes practically a dictatorshipand every man’s resources are at its command; the country is nowin an equally great emergency.38The RFC certainly paid off for these favored businessgroups. The excuse for the secrecy was that public confidencewould be weakened if the identity of the shaky business orbank receiving RFC loans became widely known. But ofcourse these institutions, precisely because they were in weakand unsound shape, deservedto lose public confidence, and thesooner the better both for the public and for the health of theeconomy, which required the rapid liquidation of unsoundinvestments and institutions. During the first five months ofoperation, from February to June 1932, the RFC made $1 bil-lion of loans, of which 60 percent went to banks and 25 percentto railroads. The theory was that railroad bonds must be pro-tected, since many of these securities were held by savingsbanks and insurance companies, alleged agents of the smallinvestor. In practice, the bulk of these RFC railroad loans went38Theodore Knappen, “The Irony of Big Business Seeking GovernmentManagement,” in Magazine of Wall Street49 (January 23, 1932): 386–88,cited in Olson, Herbert Hoover, pp. 45–46.

About a third of these loans went to repay-ing railroad debts to banks. Thus, one of the first RFC loanswas $5.75 million to the Missouri Pacific Railroad to repay itsdebt to J.P. Morgan and Company, and an $8 million loan tothe B and O Railroad to repay its debt to Kuhn, Loeb and Com-pany. One of the main enthusiasts for this policy was EugeneMeyer, who touted it as “promoting recovery” by “puttingmore money into the banks.” It certainly did the latter, at theexpense of the taxpayers and of propping up inefficient banksand businesses. The loan to Missouri Pacific was a particularlyegregious case, for as soon as Missouri Pacific performed itstask of repaying its debt to Morgan, it was gently allowed togo into bankruptcy.Another consequence of RFC bailout loans to railroads wasto accelerate the socialization of the railroad industry, since theRFC, as a large-scale creditor, was able to place governmentdirectors on the board of the railroads reorganized after bank-ruptcy.39While the Democrats in Congress had their way afterAugust in forcing the RFC to report to Congress on its loans,President Hoover had hisway in finally persuading Congressto transform the RFC into a bold, “positive” agency empow-ered to make new loans, to engage in capital loans, to financesales of agriculture at home and abroad, and to make loans tostates and cities, instead of being merely an agency defendingindebted banks and railroads. This amendment to the RFCAct, the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932,passed Congress at the end of July, and increased the RFC’sauthorized capital to $3.4 billion.

Frankfurter telegraphed Meyer’swife that “Gene . . . has been the only brave and effectiveleader in [the Hoover] administration in dealing with depres-sion.”40Free-market financial writer John T.

Any attempt to . . . save the weaker debtorsnecessarily prolongs the depression.” Railroads should not behampered from going into the “inevitable curative process” ofbankruptcy.41In the meantime, Eugene Meyer was promoting more infla-tionary damage as governor of the Federal Reserve. Meyermanaged to persuade both Hoover and Virginia conservativeCarter Glass, leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Com-mittee, to push through the Glass-Steagall Act at the end of Feb-ruary, which allowed the Fed to use U.S. government securitiesin addition to gold as collateral for Federal Reserve notes,which were of course still redeemable in gold.42This actenabled the Federal Reserve to greatly expand credit and tolower interest rates.

The Fed purchased $1.1 billion of government securitiesfrom the end of February to the end of July, raising its holdingsto $1.8 billion. Part of the reason for these vast open marketoperations was to help finance the then-huge federal deficit of$3 billion during fiscal year 1932.Thus, we see the grave error of the familiar Milton Friedman-monetarist myth that the Federal Reserve either deliberately con-tracted the money supply after 1931 or at least passivelyallowed such contraction. The Fed, under Meyer, did its might-iest to inflate the money supply—yet despite its efforts, totalbank reserves only rose by $212 million, while the total moneysupply fellby $3 billion. How could this be?The answer to the mystery is that the inflationary policies ofHoover and Meyer proved to be counterproductive. Americancitizens lost confidence in the banks and demanded cash—Fed-eral Reserve notes—for their deposits (currency in circulationrising by $122 million by the end of July), while foreigners lostconfidence in the dollar and demanded gold (the gold stock inthe United States falling by $380 million in this period). In addi-tion, the banks, for the first time, did not fully lend out theirnew reserves, and accumulated excess reserves—these excessreserves rising to 10 percent of total reserves by mid-year. Acommon explanation claims that business, during a depression,lowered its demand for loans, so that pumping new reservesinto the banks was only “pushing on a string.” But this popularview overlooks the fact that banks can always use their excessreserves to buy existing securities; they don’t have to wait fornew loan requests. Why didn’t they do so? Because the bankswere whipsawed between two forces. On the one hand, bankfailures had increased dramatically during the depression.Whereas during the 1920s, in a typical year 700 banks failed,with deposits totaling $170 million, since the depression struck,17,000 banks had been failing per year, with a total of $1.08 bil-lion in deposits. This increase in bank failures could give anybank pause, especially since all the banks knew in their hearts"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 295The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elitesthat, as fractional reserve banks, none of them could withstanddetermined and massive runs upon them by their depositors.Second, just at a time when bank loans were becoming risky, thecheap-money policy of the Fed had driven down interestreturns from bank loans, thus weakening banks’ incentive tobear risk. Hence the piling up of excess reserves. The more thatHoover and the Fed tried to inflate, the more worried the mar-ket and the public became about the dollar, the more goldflowed out of the banks, and the more deposits were redeemedfor cash.Professor Seymour Harris, writing at the time and yearsbefore he became one of America’s leading Keynesians, con-cluded perceptively that the hard-money critics of the Hooveradministration might have been right, and that it might be thatthe Fed’s heavy open market purchases of government securi-ties from 1930 to 1932 “retarded the process of liquidation andreduction of costs, and therefore have accentuated the depres-sion.”43Herbert Hoover, of course, reacted quite differently to theabject failure of his inflationist program. Instead of blaminghimself, he blamed the banks and the public. The banks were toblame by piling up excess reserves instead of making danger-ous loans. By late May, Hoover was “disturbed at the apparentlack of cooperation of the commercial banks of the country inthe credit expansion drive.” Eugene Meyer’s successor at theRFC, former Ohio Democratic Senator Atlee Pomerene,denounced the laggard banks bitterly: “I measure my words,the bank that is 75 percent liquid or more and refuses to makeloans when proper security is offered, under present circum-stances, is a parasite on the community.” Hoover also went tothe length of getting Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills to organ-ize bankers and businessmen to lend or borrow the surplus43Seymour E.

Mills established a committee inNew York City on May 19 headed by Owen D. Young, chairmanof the board of Morgan’s General Electric Corporation, and theYoung Committee tried to organize a cartel to support bondprices, but the committee, despite its distinguished personnel,failed dismally to form a cartel that could defeat marketforces.44The idea died quickly.Not content with denouncing the banks, President Hooveralso railed against the public for cashing in bank deposits forcash or gold. Stung by the public’s redeeming $800 million ofbank deposits for cash during 1931, Hoover organized a hueand cry against “traitorous hoarding.” On February 3, 1932,Hoover established a new Citizens’ Reconstruction Organiza-tion (CRO) headed by Colonel Frank Knox of Chicago. The crywent up from the CRO that the hoarder is unpatriotic becausehe restricts and destroys credit. (That is, by trying to redeemtheir own property and by trying to get the banks to redeemtheir false and misleading promises, the hoarders were expos-ing the unsound nature of the bank credit system.) On Febru-ary 6, top-level antihoarding patriots met to coordinate thedrive; they included General Charles Dawes, Eugene Meyer,Secretary of Commerce Robert P. Lamont, and Treasury Secre-tary Ogden Mills. A month later, Hoover delivered a publicaddress on the evils of hoarding: “the battle front today isagainst the hoarding of currency,” which prevents money fromgoing into active circulation and thereby lifting us out of thedepression.President Hoover later took credit for this propaganda driveputting a check on hoarding, and it is true that cash in circula-tion reached a peak of $5.44 billion in July 1932, not rising above44The Young Committee included Walter S.

The Morgans tried desperately to keepBritain on gold in 1931, and afterward tried to get their bearingsin the newly chaotic monetary arena. By the time of Roosevelt’saccession to power in the spring of 1933, the Morgans hadthrown in the towel on the American gold-coin standard;indeed, the Morgan-oriented leadership at the Treasury, Millsand Ballantine, had been agitating for going off gold consider-ably earlier.45But the overriding Morgan concern was alwaystheir associates and colleagues in England, and they hoped fora rapid return to some kind of fixed-exchange-rate relation toBritain, and perhaps, by extension, to the other major Europeancurrencies as well. The Morgans wanted to reconstruct a regimeof monetary internationalism as soon as possible.But for the first time since the turn of the century, the Mor-gans were no longer dominant over the monetary thinking ofAmerican financial and business elites.

But Meyer found out quickly that he could not agree togoing off the gold standard and an inflationary higher goldprice, and he tendered his resignation as Fed chief in early May1933.President Roosevelt’s early monetary appointments sent animportant signal of his new orientation and policies. To succeedMeyer, Roosevelt appointed his friend, the young Georgiabanker Eugene R. Black, who had been governor of the FederalReserve Bank of Atlanta. Black’s orientation may be gauged bythe fact that, when he left the Fed a year later, he was to spend16 years climbing up the executive ladder at the powerfulChase National Bank, which by this time had shifted firmlyfrom the Morgan to the Rockefeller camp (see “Banking andFinancial Legislation: 1933–1935,” p. 308).

The first and most revolutionarydeed, accomplished in April, was to go off the gold standard, toconfiscate almost all the gold of American citizens and place itunder the ownership of the Federal Reserve, to embargo theexport of gold and to devalue the dollar to $35 a gold ounce.This swift policy carried out almost completely the program ofThe Committee for the Nation. But in March and April even theMorgans had been convinced by the banking crisis to go offgold. Democratic Morgan partner Russell Leffingwell wasinfluential in urging Roosevelt to go off gold and devalue thedollar, and Jack Morgan himself applauded Roosevelt’s deci-sion to inflate and go off gold.The major theoretician of the inflationists, who had liqui-dated the assets of his own prior Stable Money Association intoThe Committee for the Nation, was Yale Professor Irving Fisher,the intellectual forerunner of Milton Friedman (who has hailedFisher as “the greatest economist of the twentieth century”) andwho mechanistically had believed that since the price level wasnot rising in the 1920s, there was no inflation to worry aboutand no coming crash. Fisher strongly urged the inflationistdevaluation and fiat standard upon Roosevelt, who had askedhim for advice. When Roosevelt cast the die against gold, Fisherexulted to his wife, “Now I amsure—as far as we ever can besure of anything—that we are going to snap out of this depres-sion fast.

As Fisher added in the same letter tohis wife: “I mean that if F.D.R. had followed Glass [who hadurged him to stay on gold] we would have been pretty surelyruined.” As it happened, the fiat money policy did notrestorethe stock market and Fisher’s and his wife’s and sister-in-law’sfortune wasruined by his unwise speculations—a mute testi-mony to the unsoundness of Fisherine monetarism in explain-ing or counteracting business cycles.51On the other side of the gold-standard decision were thebulk of the nation’s economists, who signed a mass petitionurging immediate return to gold. They were led by twodoughty hard-money men: Dr. H.

The World Eco-nomic Conference, with delegates from 64 nations, met on June12. The gold bloc at the conference, led by the French, urged animmediate restoration of the full, classical gold standard; theBritish wanted fixed exchange rates, tied to gold or not, butemphasizing that the pound must be cheaper at $4.00, so as notto lose the export advantage Britain had built up in the past twoyears. The United States, on the other had, wanted to place primeemphasis on continued domestic inflation; currency stabilization,which should not put the pound below $4.25, could wait untilsome future date after domestic prices had risen.From the beginning, however, there was great tensionbetween the bulk of the American delegation to London and theRoosevelt administration in Washington.

The stubbornness of the United States finally forced theassembled delegates to agree on an innocuous final declarationat the end of June that committed the United States to very lit-tle more than its own resolution for eventual return to a sadlydenatured gold standard, coupled with a vague agreement tocooperate in limiting exchange-rate speculation.This declaration, weak as it was, seemed to offer hope ofeventual stabilization, and so it was strongly supported bySprague, Warburg, and by chief brain truster Raymond Moley,assistant secretary of state, who was head of the American del-egation to London. Within the administration, the agreementwas strongly supported by Douglas, Baruch, and by Undersec-retary of the Treasury Dean G. Acheson. Acheson was a discipleof Morgan-oriented lawyer Henry L.

In short,Roosevelt was now totally and publicly committed to the entirenationalist Fisher–Committee for the Nation program for fiatpaper money, currency inflation, and a very steep “reflation” ofprices. The idea of stable exchange rates or an international mon-etary order would fade away for the remainder of the 1930s, andmonetary nationalism, currency blocs, and economic warfarewould be the order of the day for the remainder of the decade.52The chagrined supporters of the aborted London monetaryagreement soon found it necessary to leave the Rooseveltadministration.

Ironically, his harassment and persecu-tion of Wall Street originated with Herbert Hoover. As early as1919, Hoover had called for government regulation of the stockmarket to eliminate “vicious speculation.” In 1928 and 1929,Hoover had pioneered in the view that the problem of bankcredit was that too much of it was going to the stock market ratherthan that there was too much bank credit, period. After thecrash, President Hoover naturally segued into charging that thecollapse of stock prices was caused by the vicious action ofshort-sellers, forgetting that for every short-seller there must bea buyer. Under threat of regulation, Hoover forced Morgan manRichard Whitney, head of the New York Stock Exchange, toagree “voluntarily” to withhold loans of stock for purposes ofshort-selling.After forcing the stock exchange to restrict short-selling in thecrisis of late 1931 and yet again in February 1932, but being dis-satisfied with continuing declines in stock prices, PresidentHoover finally carried out his threat and pressured the U.S. Sen-ate to investigate the New York Stock Exchange, even though headmitted that the federal government had no constitutionaljurisdiction over the exchange, which was a New York institu-tion.

In the firstplace, the separation sections, which we have been discussing,helped the commercial bankers get rid of unprofitable securi-ties, and to eliminate the powerful competition of investmentbankers for customers’ deposits. As for investment bankers,one-third of them, including J.P. Morgan and Company, hivedoff that business to stick to deposit banking, leaving theremainder free of their competition. In particular, as we haveseen, the Rockefellers rid the commercial banks of unwelcomeinvestment banking competition.Other Banking Act provisions reinforced the cartelization.Thus, federal deposit insurance guaranteed all bank deposits,thereby cartelizing the industry and supposedly guaranteeingevery bank’s success. The prohibition of bank payment of inter-est on demand deposits was a particularly cartelizing device,since it “forced” the banks collectively to keep payment ofinterest to their depositors at zero, policing any competing bankthat would have liked to break the cartel by bidding for depos-itors’ accounts.69In addition to all this, the Banking Act of 1933 began the cru-cial process of stripping away the dominant power of the Fed-eral Reserve Bank of New York (and hence of the Morgans) overthe operations of the Federal Reserve System, and of transfer-ring that power to political appointees in Washington. Previ-ously, for example, each Federal Reserve Bank—and thereforethe private bankers in that district—had total power over itsown open-market operations—and therefore over the move-ment of bank reserves. In practice, this meant the New York69Benston, Separation of Commercial and Investment Banking, pp. 136,221–22."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 319The Federal Reserve and the Financial ElitesFed, since open market operations were in U.S. governmentsecurities, and the bond market is located in New York. TheBanking Act of 1933 began a transfer of power by creating astatutory Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). TheFOMC, however, continued to be in private banker hands, sinceit consisted of one member from each Federal Reserve District,selected by the board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank.In practice, these were the governors of each Federal ReserveBank.The new law required that every Federal Reserve bank’sopen market operation conform to Federal Reserve Board regu-lations, but each Federal Reserve bank retained the right torefuse to participate in the FOMC’s recommended open marketpolicies. The result of this hybrid system was that the FederalReserve Board was ultimately responsible for Fed policy, but itcould not initiate open market operations. The Federal ReserveBoard could ratify or veto FOMC policies, but those policieshad to be initiated by the FOMC. The Federal Open MarketCommittee, for its part, could initiate open market policies, butit could not execute them; execution remained in the hands ofthe New York Fed and the Federal Reserve banks. The FederalReserve banks, for their part, could not initiate open marketpolicies, but could obstruct them by failing to execute them.All in all, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, while losingmuch of its power over open market operations in the 1933 act,was able to live with the new arrangement. It was more annoyedover a neglected provision of the act, that forbade the New YorkFed (or any other Federal Reserve bank) from conducting nego-tiations with foreign banks—a direct slap at the crucial NewYork Fed–Morgan role during the 1920s in making arrangementswith the Bank of England and other European banks.7070Sidney Hyman,Marriner S.

Indeed, Roosevelt cunningly threw a sop to conserva-tives and moderates by naming his old friend, the Irish-Ameri-can stock speculator and buccaneer Joseph P.

Thus, Kennedy not only enthusiasticallyendorsed the New Deal, he went beyond it to advocate a gen-eral federal incorporation law, as well as the abolition of privateinvestment banking. In addition, during his buccaneeringperiod in the 1920s, he had repeatedly clashed with the Morganinterests. The extent of Kennedy’s collectivism is seen by hisassertion, similar to all collectivist planners:An organized functioning economy requires a plannedeconomy. The more complex the society the greater thedemand for planning. Otherwise there results a haphazardand inefficient method of social control, and in the absenceof planning the law of the jungle prevails.76Though Kennedy was a buccaneer, he was scarcely the loneranger. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, Kennedy workedclosely with various Hollywood film corporations, particularlythose such as Paramount Pictures, dominated by LehmanBrothers.77As for Landis, on the other hand, businessmen expecting asocialistic antibusiness force at the helm of the SEC were pleas-antly surprised to find Landis a conscious and deliberate cre-ator of governmental cartelization, of a government-businesspartnership in behalf of “industrial self-government” under thebenign aegis of federal regulation. Landis charmed the financialgroups by overcoming his personal dislike of bankers, brokers,and accountants in order to include them in his well of supportand regulation.

Instead, Landis explicitlyoffered that profession, previously resentful of domination bycorporate clients, the opportunity to cartelize and rule thesecurities roost, under the benevolent aegis of the SEC. As his-torian Thomas McCraw puts it, [I]t struck him [Landis] as far preferable to use their [theaccountants’] existing expertise and to make their profes-sional institutions the vehicle of change, rather thanattempting to force results with direct government action.79As a result, the accounting profession took to Landis and theSEC with alacrity. The American Institute of Accountants quicklyformed a Special Committee on Cooperation with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, and this group functioned as a per-manent liaison with the SEC. A leading scholar of accountancysoon noted that, with the establishment of the SEC policy, the control function of accounts takes on a new and quitedifferent form. Instead of being merely a tool of control bybusiness enterprise they become a tool for the control ofbusiness enterprise itself.78McCraw, “Landis and the Statecraft of the SEC,” in Prophets ofRegulation, p. 188.

After sixmonths as an SEC commissioner, Pecora resigned to accept an appoint-ment as a justice on the New York State Supreme Court.79As McCraw puts it, “When the leaders of the profession realizedthat a unique opportunity to gain respect lay at hand, their hostility toregulation abruptly ceased.” Ibid., p. 190."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"326A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIIn other words, the scholar, D.R. Scott, was noting the won-drous fact that whereas until the SEC, accountants were forcedto subordinate themselves to their private business clients onthe market, the SEC was enabling accountancy to enter a newera: where accountants could turn the tables by serving the cen-tral government to control and dominate their clients.80In particular, Landis set up a special accounting subdivisionheaded by a chief accountant, who quickly became the mostimportant auditing regulator in the United States. The chiefaccountant happily accepted the charge of driving toward morerigorous audits, cracking down against violators, and setting upcompulsory uniform accounting standards. In 1937, the chiefaccountant began the practice of issuing much-vaunted“Accounting Series Releases,” laying down a network of stan-dardized accounting practices for the profession. Much of theSEC’s power to enforce guidelines was deliberately delegatedto the professional associations of accountants, thus furtherenlisting the organized profession as surrogate cartelists andenforcers.One charm the SEC regulations had for the accountants isthat the SEC acts required a large number of new financial state-ments by “an independent public or certified accountant”—provisions that created a welcome substantial increase in thedemand for accountants. As a result, while the number oflawyers and physicians in the nation increased by about 71 per-cent between 1930 and 1970, the number of accountants swelledby no less than 271 percent.81Finally, Landis’s shrewd strategy induced the New Yorkand other regional stock exchanges to collaborate and runtheir own regulation, under the wing, of course, of the federalgovernment. In a series of addresses to the New York StockExchange Institute during 1935, Landis called for “self-gov-ernment” as the crucial principle.

In early 1937, Landis outlined his strategy can-didly in a major address. Regulation, Landis noted, welded together existing self-regulation and direct controlby government. In so doing, it followed lines of institutionaldevelopment, buttressing existing powers by the force ofgovernment, rather than absorbing all authority and powerto itself. In so doing, it made the loyalty of the institution tothe broad objectives of government a condition of its con-tinued existence, thus building from within as well asimposing from without.82James M. Landis left the SEC in alleged triumph in 1938 toattain the coveted post of dean of Harvard Law School.83Hewas succeeded as SEC chairman by commission memberWilliam O. Douglas, an old friend of Roosevelt’s, who haddeveloped his own network at Yale Law School. Douglas, evenmore left-wing and anti-Morgan than Landis, felt that Landishad been lax in hounding Morgan’s Richard Whitney out of hispost as head of the New York Stock Exchange. Douglas pro-ceeded to pursue this goal with vigor. But even Douglas was nosimple antibusiness socialist, preferring to continue cartelizationby working with dissident anti-Morgan groups within the stockexchange, led by the Rockefeller-oriented E.A. Pierce. Douglaswas particularly able to work with the retail commission bro-kers, led by young St. Louis stockbroker William McChesney82Ibid., p. 19283In McCraw’s worshipful account, Landis’s brilliant achievement,achieving the status of a living “legend” before he was 40 (Landis wasborn in 1899) and apparently slated for the Supreme Court, was succeed-ed by tragic decline.

The NASD promptlyfixed a uniform dealer commission rate of 5 percent—an open measure ofcartelization—and, while no broker or dealer was required to join theNASD, nonmembers were prohibited by law from engaging in any secu-rities underwriting.

How he came toimpress the New Dealers, and was called first to the Treasuryand then soon became the radical New Deal head of the FederalReserve Board and of the entire Federal Reserve System, toremain chairman of the board until after World War II.In truth, rediscovering ancient economic fallacies hardlyqualifies as a notable achievement. Eccles read Foster andCatchings in early 1931, and adopted wholesale their view ofCorporation; and S. Sloan Colt, president of the Morgan-establishedand Morgan-dominated Bankers Trust Company. Moreover, the twoyoung New York Republican leaders who actually engineered the nom-ination were Oren Root, Jr., of the top “Morgan” law firm of Davis (JohnW.), Polk, Wardwell, Gardiner and Reed; and Charlton MacVeagh. Notonly was MacVeagh a former officer of J.P. Morgan and Company, buthis father had been a longtime partner of the Davis Polk law firm, andhis brother was still an officer there. Burch, Elites, 3, pp. 44–45, 66.It is intriguing that one of Willkie’s two main rivals for the nomina-tion, New York’s Thomas E. Dewey, was all his life virtually in the hippocket of Winthrop W. Aldrich, the Rockefellers, and the Chase NationalBank. Thus, see Harr and Johnson, Rockefeller Century, pp. 208–09,405–06.87Hyman, Marriner Eccles, passim. Hyman goes so far as to say that“Marriner Eccles isAmerican economic history.” For a good summary ofEccles’s “remarkable intellectual accomplishment” from the hagiograph-ical point of view, see L.

Any intellectual acumen on Eccles’s part would, onthe contrary, have led him to realize that Foster and Catchingswere writing during the boom of the 1920s, and would have ledhim to wonder what accounted for the sudden change fromboom to depression—a change that can scarcely be explainedby an alleged state of permanent underconsumption. Under theinfluence and assistance of proto-monetarist and radical NewDealer Lauchlin Currie, Eccles soon added governmental mon-etary inflation to his armamentarium, to make him a compre-hensive inflationist and macro–New Dealer. Given such influ-ences, it was easy to become a “Keynesian” slightly beforeKeynes’s time.Moreover, it is doubtful that Marriner Eccles’s conversionto statism was purely intellectual. Marriner was the son ofDavid Eccles, who, as a penniless lad and Morman convert, hademigrated from Glasgow to Utah, there to build up one of thelargest fortunes in the West. Most of David’s fortune was inbanking and sugar manufacturing. When David died in 1912,Marriner, at age 22, managed to elbow aside competing Mor-mon families of David’s, and assume control of his father’sempire. By the early 1930s, Marriner had expanded the businessempire greatly, a business empire centered in a network of bankholding companies throughout the West, and also includingmilk production and construction as well as sugar. MarrinerEccles’s empire was centered in his bank holding company, theFirst Security Corporation, and indeed Marriner had pioneeredin forming such holding companies in banking.88Eccles’s con-version away from free markets was, indeed, micro as well as88By the time of the depression, Marriner Eccles was president of: theFirst Security Corporation, the Eccles Investment Company, the FirstNational Bank of Ogden (Utah), the First Savings Bank of Ogden, theEccles Hotel Company, the Sego Milk Company, the Utah ConstructionCompany, and the Amalgamated Sugar Company."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 333The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elitesmacro: as head of the important Amalgamated Sugar Com-pany, Eccles led a vigorous effort to cartelize the sugar indus-try, and to unite all sugar producers, foreign and domestic, inan allotment plan to form rigorous maximum production quo-tas for each firm. Furthermore, as a large banker in a shakybanking environment, Eccles was understandably eager topush for federal guarantees of bank deposits, legislation thatredounded to his direct benefit.From the failure of the voluntary sugar cartel, it was an easystep for Eccles to advocate a compulsory cartel plan for all ofagriculture: essentially the Agricultural Adjustment Adminis-tration’s domestic allotment plan for the federal government tocompel restriction of agricultural production in order to raisefarm prices. It was also an easy step for Eccles to weave togetherhis banking and sugar interests, to advocate the federal govern-ment’s subsidy of farm mortgages, mortgages which of coursehad been and would continue to be purchased by Eccles’s sav-ings banks.89There was another personal economic reason for Eccles tosuddenly look benignly on massive federal public worksspending. In 1930, President Hoover decided to build the mam-moth Boulder Dam, which became one of the major publicworks projects of the early depression years. One of the majorconstruction companies in the consortium that built the damwas Utah Construction, with Eccles putting up much of the cap-ital and personally present at the San Francisco meeting wherethe consortium was formed.9089Hyman, Marriner Eccles, p. 107. Israelson is therefore wrong to implythat Eccles confined his statism to the macro sphere. Israelson, “Marriner S.Eccles,” pp. 358–59. Actually, this implication is belied by evidence on thesame page of Israelson’s article.90Another major firm in this construction consortium was W.A.Bechtel Company. Eccles and Utah Construction had a close associationwith the Bechtels for many years, often subcontracting construction workto Bechtel in northern California.

Like theBank of America’s A.P. Giannini, Eccles was a Western out-sider to the Morgan-dominated Federal Reserve System of the1920s, and he had conceived a bitter hatred of the Morganempire, as well as a crusading desire to transform Americanbanking by shifting power in the Fed, once and for all, fromLittlefield, became a senior director of Bechtel Corporation in the early1980s.The construction of the Boulder Dam was also the occasion forBechtel to save Stephen Bechtel’s old college chum John A.

Bechtel and McConesoon began to collaborate closely with Standard Oil of California inworldwide construction contracts for refineries and oil complexes.McCone went on to become a high public official, including head of theAtomic Energy Commission and of the CIA.

Robert Hinckley, anold friend of Eccles’s and nephew of Senator William King (D-Utah), and another young man, Dean Brimhall, a brother-in-lawof Eccles’s, had formed a bimonthly discussion club in Utahcalled the Freidenkers. On hearing of Eccles’s new views, the Frei-denkersbecame Eccles’s disciples, and Hinckley used SenatorKing’s influence to get Eccles a hearing at the Senate FinanceCommittee. Also Marriner was a regent of the University ofUtah, and when radical New Dealer Stuart Chase spoke at theChautauqua lecture series at the university, he was impressedwith Eccles’s views. Another, overlooked influence on the NewDealers is the fact that George Dern, Roosevelt’s secretary of warand former governor of Utah, was a financial subaltern ofEccles’s, being a director of two Salt Lake City banks, both partof Eccles’s First Security Corporation holding company.After a year, in February 1934, Eccles came to Washingtonas special assistant on monetary and credit matters to Secre-tary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau. Eccles found himselffrustrated at Treasury, however, since Morgenthau had old-fashioned pro-balanced-budget views. Morgenthau was heav-ily under the influence of Lewis W. Douglas, still in the admin-istration as head of the Bureau of Budget (then in the TreasuryDepartment), and of Undersecretary of the Treasury T. Jeffer-son Coolidge, of the Morgan-allied financial family in Boston,who had been placed in his spot on the urging of George Har-rison. But Eccles did not waste his months at the Treasury,finding support and enthusiastic agreement in two youngaides, former Fed economist Winfield W. Riefler and LauchlinCurrie, a young Ph.D. from Harvard. Currie, whose importantmonetarist work was in the process of being published byHarvard University Press, converted Eccles to the goal of totalpolitical control over the money supply, and of the alleged"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"336A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IInecessity for recovery to concentrate on open market opera-tions for rapid inflation of the money supply.92In early September 1934, Eccles was asked by administrationaides to accept an appointment as governor of the FederalReserve Board in Washington, Eugene Black having resigned toreturn to Georgia and later to move to the Chase National Bank.Eccles boldly replied that he would only accept the post if at thesame time there was a fundamental structural change at theFed, and power was shifted from the New York Fed to the Fed-eral Reserve Board in Washington. Following up on this deter-mined stance, Eccles submitted a memorandum to the WhiteHouse on November 4, written in collaboration with Eccles’saide and theoretician, Lauchlin Currie. The memo stressed thatthe Federal Reserve Board must take full power from the NewYork Fed: that it must obtain “complete control over the timing,character and volume of open market purchases and sales ofbills and securities by the Reserve banks.” Until this point,wrote Eccles/Currie, private banker “interest, as representedby individual Reserve bank governors, has prevailed over the92See Lauchlin Currie, The Supply and Control of Money in the UnitedStates, 2nd rev. ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, [1934]1935). Currie’s doctoral thesis proved to be perhaps the most importantmonetarist work of the pre–World War II period. Currie’s thesis was simple:An ideal monetary system from the standpoint of controlwould be one in which expansions and contractions of thesupply of money could be brought about easily and quicklyto any required extent. . . . It appears to the writer that themost perfect control could be achieved by direct govern-ment issue of all money, both notes and deposits subject tocheck.

Mints, A History of Banking Theory(Chicago: University ofChicago Press, 1945). Currie’s vital influence on Eccles and hence onbanking legislation in the United States is shown in Hyman, MarrinerEccles, pp. 155 ff., and in Israelson, “Marriner S. Eccles,” p. 358.

In particular,the Federal Reserve Board must gain complete control over theOpen Market Committee, now composed of the 12 governors ofthe private Federal Reserve banks. Such changes were neces-sary, the memo concluded, in order for the Fed to become a gen-uine “central bank”; although, secure in such new powers, therewould be no need to arouse intense political opposition by call-ingsuch a setup a “central bank.”93On November 10, FDR, impressed by the memo andemboldened by his smashing victory over the Republicans inthe November 1934 congressional elections, announced theappointment of Marriner Eccles as governor of the FederalReserve Board, and he was sworn in a week later. At the sametime as his appointment was announced and submitted for con-firmation to the Senate, the radical Banking Act of 1935,embodying the Eccles/Currie program, was scheduled to besubmitted to Congress. Lined up against Eccles and the newbanking act were powerful Senator Carter Glass, chairman ofthe Senate Finance Committee and of the crucial subcommitteeof the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, as well asGlass’s theoretician Professor H. Parker Willis, who denouncedthe banking act as the “worst and most dangerous measure thathas made its appearance for a long time.” In this particular bat-tle, the opposition was a coalition of former enemies, the Willis-Glass hard-money qualitativists; and the Morgan empire, spear-headed by George L. Harrison, whose New York Fed stood tolose its dominating power over the banking system. In contrast,founding monetarist and veteran inflationist Irving Fisher ofYale, spiritual mentor to Milton Friedman, claimed that the bank-ing bill “will represent a great step forward, probably the great-est in the president’s administration.”With the fight now under way, Eccles moved quickly toestablish his own total control over dissident institutions within93Hyman, Marriner Eccles, pp. 157–58."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"338A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIthe Federal Reserve. He met with the Federal Advisory Council(FAC), a powerful voice of private bankers within the FederalReserve. The FAC consisted of one private banker from each ofthe 12 Federal Reserve districts; almost always, they were repre-sentatives from large metropolitan banks in each district. Theoccasional publications of the FAC were often presented to thepublic as if they were the official views of the Federal ReserveBoard. Thus, in September, strategically timed for the election,the FAC had publicly called for a balanced federal budget,incensing Eccles and the New Dealers. Eccles now crackeddown, ordering the FAC to confine itself to an advisory role,and to issue no public statements without first submitting therecommendations to the Federal Reserve Board and notifying itin advance of any public pronouncement. The Federal AdvisoryCouncil promptly knuckled under.Eccles then moved to completely control any legislative rec-ommendations to emerge from the Federal Reserve System. Heabolished the Fed’s Committee on Legislative Programs, whichhad been headed by Harrison, and had consisted only of pri-vate or regional Fed bankers with the exception of one repre-sentative from the Federal Reserve Board. Eccles then created anew legislative committee, consisting solely of his ownappointed professional staff. In addition to Eccles himself,members were Chester Morrill, Federal Reserve Board secre-tary; Walter Wyatt, the board’s general counsel; Emanuel Gold-enweiser, director of the Fed’s Division of Research and Statis-tics; and Lauchlin Currie, the division’s new assistant director.The committee was charged with drafting a new banking act.The committee draft would then go to a subcommittee on bank-ing legislation of the administration’s Interdepartmental LoanCommittee, chaired by Secretary Morgenthau, and consisting ofthe heads Federal Advisory Council and Federal Deposit Insur-ance Corporation (FDIC), and the comptroller of the currency,as well as several representatives of the Treasury.To gain support from the Treasury and other administrationfigures as well as from Congress and the nation’s bankers, FDR"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 339The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elitesdevised a cunning strategy: he would present Eccles’s radicalreform as Title II of the new banking act, sandwiched inbetween two reforms the bankers desperately wanted: Title I,liberalizing assessment on banks for deposit insurance, a petreform of FDIC head Leo T. Crowley; and Title III, whichgranted bankers a grace period beyond the statutory July 1,1935, imposed by the Banking Act of 1933, before they had torepay loans granted to them by their own banks. Title III was afavorite project of Comptroller of the Currency J.R.T.

In the hearings, particu-larly interesting in opposition was James P. Warburg of Kuhn,Loeb, and chairman of the board of the Kuhn, Loeb–run Bank ofManhattan. Warburg, who as an old-line banker had been alliedwith the Morgans at the London Economic Conference,denounced the banking bill as “Curried Keynes.”95In thecourse of the controversy, the highly influential New York Timesand the Washington Post(owned and directed by EugeneMeyer) changed their initial opposition to support for the bill.94Ibid., pp. 167–71.95Lauchlin Currie, continuing as economist at the Fed, rose to the postof administrative assistant to President Roosevelt during World War II.There he was recruited as a valuable member of the Silvermaster groupof Soviet espionage agents.

In the Senate,Eccles only had to make one important concession to Glass:instead of the Federal Open Market Committee consistingsolely of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board, it wouldbe instead comprised of the seven members of the FederalReserve Board plus five rotating representatives of the FederalReserve banks (in practice, their presidents) and hence of pri-vate bankers.But despite this compromise, the decisive act had takenplace: open market policy would be initiated in, dominated by,and enforced by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.Actual open market operations would be carried out, mostconveniently, in New York, but strictly under the orders of theFederal Reserve Board–dominated FOMC. Individual FederalReserve banks (in practice, the New York Fed) were prohibitedfrom buying or selling government securities for their ownaccount, except under the direction, or with the explicit per-mission, of the FOMC. To further reduce the power of the Fed-eral Reserve banks, it was explicitly provided that the bank-elected members of the FOMC were notto serve in any way asagents of the banks that elected them; indeed, the banks werenot to know what was going to happen but only to have achance to be heard through an advisory committee. Indeed,the bank presidents serving on the FOMC were not evenallowed to divulge actions taken at FOMC meetings to theirown board of directors!

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board was given vetopower over the election of the president and first vice presi-dent of each district Federal Reserve bank. And, in a symbolicgesture, all district Fed “governors,” the hoary name for headsof the central banks, were demoted to “presidents,” whereasthe old ”members” of the Federal Reserve Board in Washing-ton were upgraded to “governors,” while the previous “gov-ernor” of the Federal Reserve Board now became the board’saugust “chairman of the board of governors.” Furthermore,cementing Chairman Eccles’s power within Washington, theTreasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency wereboth removed as ex officio members of the Federal ReserveBoard.Finally, the last shred of qualitativist restraint upon theFed’s expansion of credit was removed, as bank assets deemedeligible for Fed rediscounting were broadened totally toinclude any paper whatever deemed “satisfactory” by theFed—that is, any assets the Fed wished to declare eligible.96The Banking Act of 1935 was important for being the finalsettled piece of New Deal banking legislation that consoli-dated all the revolutionary changes from the beginning of theRoosevelt administration. The Morgans tried desperately, forexample, to alter the 1933 Glass-Steagall provision, compellingthe separation of commercial and investment banking, but thisreversion was successfully blocked by Winthrop Aldrich.Specifically, Senator Glass’s amendment to the Banking Act of1935, restoring limited securities power to deposit banks,was able to reach the congressional conference committee;for a while, it looked like this Morgan maneuver would suc-ceed, but presumably at the behest of Aldrich, however, FDR96Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History, pp. 445–49."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"342A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIpersonally interceded with the committee to kill the Glassamendment.97For his part, Aldrich, as a Wall Street banker himself, was notvery happy about the permanent shift of power from WallStreet to Washington, but he was content to go along with theoverall result, as part of the anti-Morgan coalition with Westernbanking.The centralization of power over the banking system inWashington was now complete. It is no wonder that the irre-pressible H. Parker Willis, writing the following year,lamented the centralized monetary and banking tyranny thatthe Federal Reserve had become. Willis wisely perceived thatthe course of inflationary centralization to have begun in the1920s as Morgan control in the hands of the New York Fed,and now, with the New Deal, was immeasurably acceleratedand shifted to Washington:The Eccles group which advocated the Act of 1935 sought toobtain for themselves those powers which the more ambi-tious of the banking clique in New York and elsewhere hadalready arrogated to the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkand to the small group by which the institution was practi-cally directed [the House of Morgan]. There was no change inthe conception or notion of centralization, but only in theagency or personnel through which such centralization shouldbe put into effect.98The New Deal, Willis went on, had passed various allegedlytemporary and emergency measures in its first three years,which were now permanently consolidated into the BankingAct of 1935, and thus “was built up perhaps the most highly97Chernow, House of Morgan, p. 384; Ferguson, “Coming of the NewDeal,” pp. 29–30.98Henry Parker Willis, The Theory and Practice of Central Banking: WithSpecial Reference to American Experience 1913–1935(New York: Harper andBrothers, 1936), p. 107."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"From Hoover to Roosevelt: 343The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elitescentralized and irresponsible financial and banking machine ofwhich the modern world holds record.”The result, Willis pointed out, was that the years of“tremendous deficit” from 1931 on were marked by a processof “gradually diverting the funds and savings of the commu-nity to the support of governmentally directed enterprises.” Itwas “an extraordinary development—an extreme application ofcentral banking which brought the system of the United Statesto a condition of even higher concentration” than in other coun-tries. Willis ominously and prophetically concluded, Today, the United States thus stands out as a nation ofdespotically controlled central banking; one in which, as allnow admit, moreover, business paper of every kind is grad-ually taking the form of government paper which is thenfinanced through a governmentally controlled central bank-ing organization.99EPILOGUE: RETURN OF THEMORGANSIt is well not to cry for the Morgans. Though permanentlydethroned by the New Deal, they were able to make a comebackby the late 1930s. The great thrust for economic nationalism hadsubsided, and the Morgans were able to begin to work again forstabilization of exchange rates. In the fall of 1936, the United99Ibid., p. 108. Marriner Eccles, too, ended up left behind by the NewDeal revolution he had helped to lead. Specifically, Eccles could notunderstand why Truman’s Fair Deal insisted on continuing deficits andmonetary inflation even after the depression and World War II were over.Removed by Truman as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1948,Eccles, as a continuing member of the board, was the principal figure inforcing an end, in 1951, to the disastrously inflationary Fed policy of sup-porting the price of Treasury securities, and hence providing a channelfor perpetual monetization of the federal deficit. After leaving the Fed,Eccles went back into the conservative Republican camp.

Soon, theagreement, which was to last until World War II, was expandedto include Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland. As the nations moved toward World War II, the Morgans,who had long been closely connected with Britain and France,rose in importance in American foreign policy, while the Rocke-fellers, who had little connection with Britain and France andhad patent agreements with I.G.

De facto, however, the U.S. barred export ofgold during the war, and so was effectively off gold during thatperiod. In March 1919, when foreign exchange markets becamefree once more, the bad news became evident: while the dollar,again de facto as well as de jure on gold, remained at its prewarpar (approximately one-twentieth of a gold ounce), Europeanfiat paper currencies were sadly depreciated.

Countries shifted to and fromfreely fluctuating parallel gold and silver standards, inattempts, self-defeating in the long run, to fix the rate ofexchange between the two metals (“bimetallism”). The factthat countries stampeded from silver and toward goldmonometallism in the late nineteenth century should notobscure the fact that gold and silver, for centuries, were theworld’s moneys, and that previous paper money experiments(the longest during the Napoleonic Wars) were considered tobe both ephemeral and disastrously inflationary. Specie stan-dards, whether gold or silver, have been virtually coextensivewith the history of civilization.4Apart from a few calamitousThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years3533See Palyi, Twilight of Gold, pp. 1–21, 118–19.

While goldbullion, in the form of large bars, was used for internationalpayment, gold coin was used in everyday transactions by thegeneral public. For obvious reasons, it is the inherent tendencyof every money-issuer to create as much money as it can getaway with, but governments or central banks were, on thegold standard, restricted in their issue of paper or bankdeposits by the iron necessity of immediate redemption ingold, and particularly in gold coin on demand. As in the famil-iar Hume-Cantillon international price-specie flow mecha-nism, an increase of bank notes or deposits in a countrybeyond its gold stock increases the supply of money, sayfrancs in France. The increase of the supply of francs andincomes in francs leads to (a) an increase in both domestic andforeign spending, hence raising imports; and (b) a rise indomestic French prices, in turn making domestic goods lesscompetitive abroad and lowering exports, and making foreigngoods more attractive and raising imports.

In addition, clients who areholders of French bank notes or deposits, are apt to becomeincreasingly concerned, lose confidence in the viability of theFrench banks, and hence call on those banks to redeem ingold—putting those banks at risk for a devastating bank run.The result will be an often panicky and sudden contraction ofbank notes, generating a recession to replace the previousinflationary boom, and leading to a contraction in notes anddeposits, a drop in the French money supply, and a conse-quent fall in domestic French prices. The balance-of-paymentsdeficit is reversed, and gold flows back into French coffers.In short, the classical gold standard put a severe limit uponthe inherent tendency of monopoly money-issuers to issue moneywithout check. As Ludwig von Mises pointed out, this interna-tional specie-flow mechanism also described a correct, if primi-tive, model of the business cycle. While central banking andfractional reserve banking allowed play for a boom-bust cycle,the inflationary boom, and its compensating bust, was kept instrict bounds.5While scarcely perfect or lacking problems, theclassical gold standard worked well enough for the world afterWorld War I to look back upon it with understandable nostal-gia.6The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years3555Prices during the boom did not necessarily increase in historicalterms. If a secular price fall was occurring due to increased production,as happened in much of the nineteenth century, the inflationary boomtook the form of prices being higher than they would have been in theabsence of the expansion of money and credit. 6While the United States was the only major power before 1914 to lacka central bank, the quasi-centralized national banking system performeda similar function in the years between the Civil War and 1914.

The other powers suffered from national fiatcurrencies; suddenly, their currencies were no longer units ofweight of gold but independent names, such as pound, franc,mark, etc., their rates depreciating in relation to gold andvolatile with respect to one another. Except for maverickssuch as Cambridge’s John Maynard Keynes, it was generallyagreed that this system was intolerable, and that a way mustbe found to reconstruct a world monetary order, includingrestoration of a world money and medium of exchange. Atthe heart of the European monetary crisis was Great Britain,which would take the lead in trying to solve the problem. Inthe first place, London had been the major prewar financialcenter; and second, Britain dominated the postwar League ofNations, and in particular its powerful Economic and Finan-cial Committee. Furthermore, though inflated and depreci-ated, the British pound was still in far better shape than theother major currencies of Europe. Thus, while the pound ster-ling in February 1920 was depreciated by 35 percent com-pared to its 1914 gold par, the French franc was depreciatedby 64 percent, the Belgian franc by 62 percent, the Italian liraby 71 percent, and the German mark in terrible shape by 96percent.7It was clear that Britain was in a position to guidethe world to a new postwar monetary order, and it eagerlytook up what turned out to be the last remnants of its oldimperial task.The British understandably decided that the fluctuating fiatmoney system inherited from the war was intolerable, and thatit was vital to return to a sound international money, the goldstandard. However, at the same time, they also decided thatthey would have to return to gold at the old prewar par of356A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II7Palyi, Twilight of Gold, pp. 38–39."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"$4.86. Apparently, few if any economists or statesmen at thetime argued for cutting British losses, starting with the realworld as it existed in the early 1920s, facing reality, and goingback to gold at the realistic, depreciated $3.20 or $3.50 perpound sterling. In view of the enormous difficulties the deci-sion to go back to gold at $4.86 entailed, it is difficult in hind-sight to understand why there was so little support for goingback at a realistic par or why there was so much drive to goback at the old one.8For going back to a pound 30 to 35 percentabove the market rate, meant that English exports upon whichthe country depended to finance its exports, were now pricedfar above their competitive price in world markets. Coal, cot-ton textiles, iron and steel, and shipbuilding, in particular, thebulk of the export industries that had generated prewar pros-perity, became permanently depressed in the 1920s, withaccompanying heavy unemployment in those industries. Inorder to avoid export depression, Britain would have to havebeen willing to undergo a substantial monetary and pricedeflation, to make its goods once more competitive in foreignmarkets. But, in contrast to pre-World War I days, British wagerates had been made rigid downward by powerful trade-unionism, and particularly by a massive and extravagant sys-tem of national unemployment insurance. Rather than accept arigorous deflationary policy, therefore, to accompany its returnto gold, Britain insisted on just the opposite: a continuation ofmonetary inflation and a policy of low interest rates and cheapmoney. Thus, Great Britain, in the post-World War I world,committed itself to a monetary policy based on three rigidlyfirm but mutually self-contradictory axioms: (1) a return togold; (2) returning at a sharply overvalued pound of $4.86; and(3) continuing a policy of inflation and cheap money. Given aprogram based on such grave inner self-contradiction, theThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years3578For an early English critique of not going back at a realistic par, seeLionel Robbins, The Great Depression(New York: Macmillan, 1934), esp.pp. 77–87."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"British maneuvered on the world monetary scene with brillianttactical shrewdness; but it was a policy that was doomed toend in disaster.Why did the British insist on returning to gold at the old,overvalued par? Partly it was a vain desire to recapture oldglories, to bring back the days when London was the world’sfinancial center. The British did not seem to realize fully thatthe United States had emerged from the war as the great cred-itor nation, and financially the strongest one, so that financialpredominance was inexorably moving to New York or Wash-ington. To recapture their financial predominance, the Britishbelieved that they would have to bring back the old, traditional,$4.86. Undoubtedly, the British also remembered that after twodecades of war against the French Revolution and Napoleon,the pound had quickly recovered from its depreciated state, andthe British had been able to restore the pound at its pre-fiatmoney par. This restoration was made possible by the fact thatthe post–Napoleonic War pound returned quickly to its prewarpar, because of a sharp monetary and price deflation thatoccurred in the inevitable postwar recession.9The British afterWorld War I apparently did not realize that (a) the restoration ofthe pre–Napoleonic War par had required a substantial defla-tion, and (b) their newly rigidified war structure could not eas-ily afford or adapt to a deflationary policy. Instead, the Britishwould insist on having their cake and eating it too: on enjoyingthe benefits of gold at a highly overvalued pound while stillcontinuing to inflate and luxuriate in cheap money. 358A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II9The pound sterling was depreciated by 45 percent before the end ofthe Napoleonic War. When the war ended, the pound returned nearly toits prewar gold par. This appreciation was caused by (a) a general expec-tation that Britain would resume the gold standard, and (b) a monetarycontraction of 17 percent in one year, from 1815 to 1816, accompanied bya price deflation of 63 percent.

Fetter, Development of BritishMonetary Orthodoxy, 1797–1875(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UniversityPress, 1965)."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Another reason for returning at $4.86 was a desire by thepowerful city of London—the financiers who held much of thepublic debt swollen during the war—to be repaid in poundsthat would be worth their old prewar value in terms of gold andpurchasing power. Since the British were now attempting tosupport more than twice as much money on top of approxi-mately the same gold base as before the war, and the otherEuropean countries were suffering from even more inflated cur-rencies, the British and other Europeans complained all duringthe 1920s of a gold “shortage,” or shortage of “liquidity.” Thesecomplaints reflected a failure to realize that, on the market, a“shortage” can only be the consequence of an artificially lowprice of a good. The “gold shortage” of the ‘20s reflected theartificially low “price” of gold, that is, the artificially overval-ued rate at which pounds—and many other European curren-cies—returned to gold in the 1920s, and therefore the arbitrarilylow rate at which gold was pegged in terms of those currencies. More particularly, since the pound was pegged at an over-valued rate compared to gold, Britain would tend to suffer inthe 1920s from gold flowing out of the country. Or, put anotherway, the swollen and inflated pounds would, in the classicprice-specie-flow mechanism, tend to drive gold out of Britainto pay for a deficit in the balance of payments, an outflow thatcould put severe contractionary pressure upon the Englishbanking system. But how could Britain, in the postwar world,cleave to these contradictory axioms and yet avoid a disastrousoutflow of gold followed by a banking collapse and monetarycontraction?RETURN TOGOLD AT$4.86:THECUNLIFFECOMMITTEE ANDAFTERBritain’s postwar course had already been set during thewar. In January 1918, the British Treasury and the Ministry ofReconstruction established the Cunliffe Committee, the Com-mittee on Currency and Foreign Exchanges After the War,headed by the venerable Walter Lord Cunliffe, retiring governorThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years359"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"of the Bank of England. As early as its first interim report in thesummer of 1918, and confirmed by its final report the followingyear, the Cunliffe Committee called in no uncertain terms forreturn to the gold standard at the prewar par. No alternativeswere considered.10This course was confirmed by the Vassar-Smith Committee on Financial Facilities in 1918, which wascomposed largely of representatives of industry and com-merce, and which endorsed the Cunliffe recommendations. Aminority of bankers, including Sir Brien Cockayne and incom-ing Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman, argued foran immediate return to gold at the old par, but they were over-ruled by the majority, led by their economic adviser, the distin-guished Cambridge economist and chosen successor to AlfredMarshall’s professorial chair, Arthur Cecil Pigou. Pigou arguedfor postponement of the return, hoping to ease the transitionby loans from abroad and, particularly, by inflation in theUnited States. The hope for U.S. inflation became a continuingtheme during the 1920s, since inflated and depreciated Britainwas in danger of losing gold to the United States, a loss whichcould be staved off, and the new 1920s system sustained, byinflation in the United States. After exchange controls and mostother wartime controls were lifted at the end of 1919, Britain,not knowing precisely when to return to gold, passed the Goldand Silver Export Embargo Act in 1920 for a five-year period,in effect continuing a fiat paper standard until the end of 1925,with an announced intention of returning to gold at that time.Britain was committed to doing something about gold in1925.11The United States and Great Britain both experienced a tra-ditional immediate postwar boom, continuing the wartime360A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II10Moggridge, British Monetary Policy, p. 18; and Palyi, Twilight of Gold,p. 75.11R.S.

The English deflation did notsuffice to correct the overvaluation of the pound, since theUnited States, now the strongest country on gold, had deflatedas well. The fact that sterling began to appreciate to the old parduring 1924 misled the British into thinking that the poundwould not be overvalued at $4.86; actually, the appreciation wasthe result of speculators betting on a nearly sure thing: thereturn to gold during 1925 of the pound at the old $4.86 par.A crucial point: while prices and wage rates rose together inEngland during the wartime and postwar inflationary boom,they scarcely fell together. When commodity prices fell sharplyin England in 1920 and 1921, wages fell much less, remaininghigh above prewar levels. This rise in real wage rates, bringingabout high and chronic unemployment, reflected the severedownward wage rigidity in Britain after the war, caused by thespread of trade unionism and particularly by the massive newunemployment insurance program.12The condition of the English economy, in particular the highrate of unemployment and depression of the export industriesduring the 1922–1924 recovery from the postwar recession,should have given the British pause. From 1851 to 1914, theunemployment rate in Great Britain had hovered consistentlyaround 3 percent; during the boom of 1919–1920, it was 2.4 per-cent. Yet, during the postwar “recovery,” British unemploymentranged between 9 and 15 percent. It should have been clear thatsomething was very wrong.It is no accident that the high unemployment was concen-trated in the British export industries.

But while real imports were 100 in 1924, real exportswere in sickly shape, at only 72. Or, in monetary terms, Britishimports were 111 in 1924, whereas British exports were only 80.In contrast, world exports were 107 as compared to 1913.The sickness of British exports may be seen in the fate of thetraditional, major export industries during the 1920s. Comparedto 1913, iron and steel exports in 1924 were 77.5; cotton textileexports were 65; coal exports were 80; and shipbuilding exportsa disastrous 35. Consequently, Britain was now in debt to suchstrong countries as the United States, while a creditor to suchfinancially weak countries as France, Russia, and Italy.13It should be clear that the export industries suffered particu-larly from depression because of the impact of the overvaluedpound; and that furthermore the depression took the form ofpermanently high unemployment even in the midst of a generalrecovery because wage rates were kept rigidly downward bytrade unions, and especially by the massive system of unem-ployment insurance.14There were several anomalies and paradoxes in the conflictsand discussions over the Cunliffe Committee recommendationsfrom 1918 until the actual return to gold in 1925.

And yet, most of these inflationistsand antideflationists (with the exception of Keynes and of W.Peter Rylands, Federation of British Industries president in1921) were willing to go along with return at the prewar par.This put the critics of deflation and proponents of cheapmoney in the curiously anomalous position of being willing toaccept return to an overvalued pound, while combating thelogic of that pound—namely, deflation in order to attain Eng-lish exports competitive in world markets. Thus McKenna,who positively desired a policy of domestic inflation and cheapmoney and cared little for exchange-rate stability or gold, waswilling to go along with the return to gold at $4.86. The Feder-ation of British Industries, which recognized the increasingrigidity of wage costs, was fearful of deflation, and its 1921President Peter Rylands argued forcefully that stability ofexchange “is of far greater importance than the re-establish-ment of any prewar ratio,” and went so far as to advocate areturn at the far more sensible rate of $4.00 to the pound:We have got accustomed to a relationship . . . of about fourdollars to the pound, and I feel that the interests of themanufacturers would be best served if it could by somemeans be fixed at four dollars to the pound and remain therefor all time.15But apart from Rylands, the other antideflationists were will-ing to go along with the prewar par.

In the first place, there was a con-fident expectation, echoing the original view of Pigou, that priceinflation in the United States would set things right and validatethe $4.86 pound. This was the argument used on behalf of $4.86by the Round Table, by McKenna, and by his fellow dissidentbanker, F.C. Goodenough, chairman of Barclays Bank. A second reason we have already alluded to: the inevitablerise in sterling to par as the return date approached misledmany people into believing that the market action was justify-ing the choice of rate. But a third reason for optimism particu-larly needs exploring: that the British were subtly but cruciallychanging the rules of the game, and returning to a very differentand far weaker “gold standard” than had existed before the war.When the British government made its final decision toreturn to gold at $4.86 in the spring of 1925, Colonel F.V. Willey,head of the Federation of British Industries, was one of the fewto register a perceptive warning note:The announcement made today . . . will rapidly bring thepound to parity with the dollar and will . . . increase thepresent difficulties of our export trade, which is already suf-fering from a greater rise in the value of the pound than isjustified by the relative level of sterling and gold prices.17The way was paved for the final decision to return to goldby the Committee on Currency and Bank of England NoteIssues, appointed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snow-den on May 5, 1924, at the suggestion of influential British Trea-sury official Sir Otto Niemeyer. The committee, known as theChamberlain-Bradbury Committee, was co-chaired by former364A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II16Round Table14 (1923), p. 28, quoted in ibid., p. 136.17The Times(London) April 29, 1925, cited in ibid., p. 144."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Chancellor Sir Austen Chamberlain and by Sir John Bradbury,a former member of the old Cunliffe Committee. Also on thenew committee were Niemeyer and Professor Pigou of theCunliffe group. We have a full account of the testimony beforethe Chamberlain-Bradbury Committee, and of the argumentsused to induce Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill to goback to gold the following year. It is clear from those accountsthat the dominant theme was that deflation and exportdepression could be avoided because of expected rising pricesin the United States, which would restore the British exportposition and avoid an outflow of gold from Britain to theUnited States. Thus, Sir Charles Addis, a member of the oldCunliffe Committee, a director of the Bank of England, and thedirector upon whom bank Governor Montagu Norman reliedmost for advice, called for a return to gold during 1925. Addiswelcomed any deflation as a necessary sacrifice in order torestore London as the world’s financial center, but he expecteda rise in prices in the United States. After listening to a greatdeal of testimony, the committee leaned toward recommend-ing not a return to gold but waiting until 1925 so as to allowAmerican prices to rise.

Because of the power of the new UnitedStates central bank, the Federal Reserve System, installed in1914, and because of the close and friendly relationshipbetween the British government, its Bank of England, and theFederal Reserve. The Fed, they were sure, would do what wasnecessary to help Britain reconstruct the world monetary order.To understand these expectations, we must explore the Fed-eral Reserve–Bank of England connection, and particularly thecrucial tie that bound them together: their mutual relationshipwith the House of Morgan. The powerful J.P. Morgan and Com-pany took the lead in planning, drafting the legislation, andmobilizing the agitation for the Federal Reserve System thatbrought the dubious benefits of central banking to the UnitedStates in 1914. The purpose of the Federal Reserve was tocartelize the nation’s banking system, and to enable the banks toinflate together, centralizing and economizing reserves, with theFederal Reserve as “lender of last resort.” The Federal Reserve’snew monopoly of note issue took the de facto place of gold as thenation’s currency. Not only were the majority of Federal ReserveBoard directors in the Morgan orbit, but the man who was ableto become the virtually absolute ruler of the Fed from its incep-tion to his death in 1928, Benjamin Strong, was a man who hadspent his entire working life as a leading Morgan banker.24Benjamin Strong was a protégé of the most powerful of thepartners of the House of Morgan after Morgan himself, Henry368A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIand palliatives.

So close were Davison and Strong that, whenStrong’s wife committed suicide after childbirth, Davison tookthe three surviving Strong children into his home.

Inaddition, the House of Morgan had long been closely associatedwith British and French wars, its London branch having helpedEngland finance the Boer, and its French bank the Franco-Pruss-ian War of 1870–1871.26As soon as war in Europe began, Harry Davison rushed toEngland and got the House of Morgan a magnificent deal: Mor-gan was made the monopoly purchaser of all goods and sup-plies for the British and French in the United States for the dura-tion of the war. In this coup, Davison was aided and abetted bythe British ambassador to Washington, Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice, a personal friend of J.P. Morgan, Jr. These war-based pur-chases eventually amounted to an astronomical $3 billion, outof which the House of Morgan was able to earn a direct com-mission of $30 million. In addition, the House of Morgan wasable to steer profitable British and French war contracts to thosefirms which it dominated, such as General Electric, DuPont,Bethlehem Steel, and United States Steel, or to those firms withwhich it was closely allied, such as DuPont Company and theGuggenheims’ huge copper companies, Kennecott and Ameri-can Smelting and Refining.To pay for these massive purchases, Britain and France wereobliged to float huge bond issues in the United States, and theymade the Morgans virtually the sole underwriter for thesebonds. Thus, the Morgans benefited heavily once more: fromthe bond issues, as well as from the fees and contracts from warpurchases by the Allies.370A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II26France also appointed the House of Morgan as its fiscal agent, hav-ing long had close connections through the Paris branch, Morgan Harjes.Chernow, House of Morgan, pp. 104–05, 186, 195.

The New York Fed sold nearly half of all Treasury secu-rities offered during the war; it handled most of the Treasury’sforeign exchange business, and acted as a central depositoryof funds from other Federal Reserve banks. Because of thisTreasury support, Strong and the New York Fed emerged fromthe U.S. experience in World War I as the dominant force inAmerican finance.

This meeting proved to be the beginning of themomentous Strong-Norman close friendship and collaborationthat was a dominant feature of the international financial worldin 1920. Norman became governor of the Bank of England in1920 and the two men continued their momentous collabora-tion until Strong’s death in 1928.Montagu Collet Norman was born to banking on both sidesof his family. His father was a banker and related to the greatbanking family of Barings, while his uncle was a partner of Bar-ing Brothers.

Norman would disappear for long, platonic week-ends with Lady Sybil, who inducted him into the mysteries oftheosophy and the occult, and Norman became a godfather tothe numerous Smith children.Strong, who had been divorced by his second wife, and Nor-man, formed a close friendship that lasted until Strong’s death.They would engage in long vacations together, registeringunder assumed names, sometimes at Bar Harbor or Saratogabut more often in southern France. The pair would, in addition,visit each other at length, and also write a steady stream of cor-respondence, personal as well as financial.While the close personal relations between Strong and Nor-man were of course highly important for the collaboration thatformed the international monetary world of the 1920s, it shouldnot be overlooked that both were intimately bound to theHouse of Morgan. “Monty Norman,” writes a historian of theMorgans, “was a natural denizen of the secretive Morganworld.” He continues: The House of Morgan formed an indispensable part of Nor-man’s strategy for reordering European economies. . . .Imperial to the core, he [Norman] wanted to preserve Lon-don as a financial center and the bank [of England] asarbiter of the world monetary system.

In fact, the Morgan-Strong friendship wouldmock any notion of the new Federal Reserve System as acurb on private banking power.31Let us now turn specifically to the aid that Benjamin Strongdelivered to Great Britain to permit its return to gold at $4.86 in1925. A key as we have seen, to permit Britain to inflate ratherthan declare, was to induce the United States to inflate dollarsso as to keep it from losing gold to the U.S. Before the return togold, the United States was supposed to inflate so as to per-suade the exchange markets that $4.86 would be viable andthereby lift the pound from its postwar depreciated state to the$4.86 figure. Benjamin Strong and the Fed began their postwar inflation-ary policy from November 1921 until June 1922, when the Fedtripled its holdings of U.S. government securities and happilydiscovered the expansion of reserves and inflation of the moneysupply. Fed authorities hailed the inflation as helping to get thenation out of the 1920–21 recession, and Montagu Normanlauded the easy credit in the U.S. and urged upon Strong a fur-ther inflationary fall in interest rates.32The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years37531Chernow, House of Morgan, pp. 246, 244.32Too much has been made of the fact that this discovery of the infla-tionary power of open market purchases by the Fed was the accidentalresult of a desire to increase Fed earnings. The result was not whollyunex-pected. Thus, Strong, in April 1922, wrote to Undersecretary of theTreasury S. Parker Gilbert that one of his major reasons for these open mar-ket purchases was “to establish a level of interest rates . . . which wouldfacilitate foreign borrowing in this country . . . and facilitate businessimprovement.” Strong to Gilbert, April 18, 1922.

Instead of rising further toward $4.86,the pound began to fall in the foreign exchange markets inresponse to Britain’s inflationary policies, the pound slipping to$4.44 and reaching $4.34 by mid-1924. Since Strong was illthrough much of 1923, the Federal Reserve Board was able totake command during his absence, and to sell off most of theFed’s holdings of government securities. Strong returned to hisdesk in November, however, and by January his rescue of Nor-man and of British inflationary policy was under way. During1924 the Fed purchased nearly $500 million in governmentsecurities, driving up the U.S. money supply by 8.3 percent dur-ing that year.33Benjamin Strong outlined the reasoning for his inflationarypolicy in the spring of 1924 to other high U.S. officials. To NewYork Fed official Pierre Jay, he explained that it was in the U.S.interest to facilitate Britain’s earliest possible return to the goldstandard, and that in order to do so, the U.S. had to inflate, sothat its prices were a bit higher than England’s, and its interestrates a bit lower. At the proper moment, credit inflation, “secretat first,” would only be made public, “when the pound is fairlyclose to par.” To Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon,Strong explained that in order to enable Britain to return togold, the U.S. would have to bring about a “gradual readjust-ment” of price levels so as to raise U.S. prices relative to Britain.The higher U.S. prices, added Strong, “can be facilitated bycooperation between the Bank of England and the Federal376A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIAmerica’s Great Depression, 4th ed.

Because it will be difficult politically and socially for the British gov-ernment and the Bank of England to force a price liquidationin England beyond what they have already experienced inface of the fact that their trade is poor and they have a mil-lion unemployed people receiving government aid.34 Or, to put it in blunter terms, the American people wouldhave to pay the penalties of inflation in order to enable theBritish to pursue a self-contradictory policy of returning to goldat an overvalued pound, while continuing an inflationary pol-icy, so that they would not have to confront the consequences oftheir own actions, including the system of massive unemploy-ment insurance.Moreover, to ease the British return to gold, the New YorkFed extended a line of credit for gold of $200 million to theBank of England in early January 1925, bolstered by a similar$100 million line of credit by J.P. Morgan and Company to theBritish government, a credit instigated by Strong and guaran-teed by the Federal Reserve. It must be added that these large$300 million credits were warmly approved by Secretary Mel-lon and unanimously approved by the Federal ReserveBoard.35American monetary inflation, backed by the heavy line ofcredit to Britain, temporarily accomplished its goal.

They wereattempting to clothe themselves in the prestige of gold whiletrying to avoid its anti-inflationary discipline. They went back,not to the classical gold standard, but to a bowdlerized andessentially sham version of that venerable standard.In the first place, under the old gold standard, the nominalcurrency, whether issued by government or bank, wasredeemable in gold coin at the defined weight. The fact thatpeople were able to redeem in and use gold for their daily trans-actions kept a strict check on the overissue of paper. But in thenew gold standard, British pounds would not be redeemable ingold coin at all: only in “bullion” in the form of bars worthmany thousands of pounds. Such a gold standard meant thatgold could not be redeemed domestically at all; bars couldhardly circulate for daily transactions, so that they could onlybe used by wealthy international traders.

Firstwas the attainment of a $300 million credit line from the UnitedStates. Second was that the bank rate would not increase uponannouncement of the decision, so that there would be nocontractionary or anti-inflationary pressure exercised by theBank of England. And third and perhaps most important wasthat the new standard would be gold bullion and not gold coin.The chancellor of the Exchequer would persuade the large“clearing banks” to “use every effort . . . to discourage the use ofgold for internal circulation in this country.” The bankers werewarned that if they could not provide satisfactory assurancesthat they would not redeem in gold coin, “it would be necessaryto introduce legislation on this point.” The Treasury, in short,wanted to avoid “psychologically unfortunate and controversiallegislation” barring gold redemption within the country, but atthe same time wanted to guard against the risk of “internaldrain” (that is, redemption in the property to which they wereentitled) from foreign agents, the irresponsible public, or “soundcurrency fanatics.”43The bankers, headed by ReginaldMcKenna, were of course delighted not to have to redeem ingold, but wanted legislation to formalize this desired condition.Finally, the government and the bankers agreed happily onthe following: the bankers would not hold gold, or acquire goldcoins or bullion for themselves, or for any customers residing inthe United Kingdom. The Treasury, for its part, redrafted itsbanking report to allow for legislation to prevent any internalredemption if necessary, and “enforce” such a ban on the all-too-willing bankers.Under the Gold Standard Act of 1925, then, pounds wereconvertible into gold, not in coin, but in bars of no less than 400gold ounces, that is $1,947. The new gold standard was not evena full gold bullion standard, since there was to be no redemption382A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II43The latter phrase is in a letter from Sir Otto Niemeyer to WinstonChurchill, February 25, 1925.

Thus, Norman, whenasked by the governor of the Bank of Norway for his adviceabout returning to gold, urged Norway to return only in goldbars, and only for international payments. Norman’s reasoningis revealing:[I]n Norway the convenience of paper currency is appreci-ated, and confidence in the value of money does not dependupon the existence of gold coin. . . . Demand is renderedmore inelastic wherever the principle of gold circulation, forcurrency or for hoarding, is accepted, and any inelasticitymay be dangerous. . . . I do not believe that gold in circula-tion can safely be regarded as a reserve that can be madeavailable in case of need, and I think that even in times ofabundance hoarding is bad, because it weakens the com-mand of the Central Bank over the monetary circulation andhence over the purchasing power of the monetary unit.For these reasons, I suggest that your best course would beto establish convertibility of notes into gold bars only and inamounts which will ensure that the use of monetary goldcan be limited, in case of need, to the settlement of interna-tional balances.45, 46The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years38344Ibid., pp. 79–83.45Clay, Lord Norman, pp. 153–54; and Palyi, Twilight of Gold, pp. 121–23.46Contrast to Norman these insights of pro-gold-coin-standard econo-mist Walter Spahr: A gold-coin standard provides the people with direct con-trol over the government’s use and abuse of the publicpurse. . . .

The way was paved for this develop-ment by the fact that, during World War I, the European coun-tries had systematically taken gold coins out of circulation andreplaced them with paper notes and deposits. During the 1920s,virtually the only country still on the classical gold-coin stan-dard was the United States.Despite this tradition, it was still necessary for Monty Nor-man and the Bank of England to exert considerable pressure toforce many European nations to return to gold bullion ratherthan gold coin. Thus, Dr. William Adams Brown, Jr., writes:In some countries the reluctance to adopt the gold bullionstandard was so great that some outside pressure wasneeded to overcome it . . .

In a gold-exchange stan-dard, only one country, in this case Great Britain, is on a goldstandard in the sense that its currency is actually redeemable ingold, albeit only gold bullion for foreigners. All other Europeancountries, even though nominally on a gold standard, wereactually on a pound-sterling standard. In short, a typical Euro-pean country, say, “Ruritania,” would hold as reserves for itscurrency, not gold but British pounds sterling, in practice, billsor deposits payable in sterling at London. Anyone whodemanded redemption for Ruritanian “rurs,” then, wouldreceive British pounds rather than gold.The gold-exchange standard, then, cunningly broke the classi-cal gold standard’s stringent limits on monetary and creditexpansion, not only for the other European countries, but also forthe base or key currency country, Great Britain itself. Under thegenuine gold standard, inflating the number of pounds in circu-lation would cause pounds to flow into the hands of other coun-tries, which would demand gold in redemption. Thereby goldwould move out of British bank and currency reserves, and pres-sure would be put on Britain to end its inflation and to contractcredit. But, under the gold-exchange standard, the process wasvery different. If Britain inflated the number of pounds in circu-lation, the result, again, was a deficit in the balance of trade andsterling balances piling up in the accounts of other nations. Butnow that these nations have been induced to use pounds as theirreserves rather than gold, these nations, instead of redeeming thepounds in gold, would inflate, and pyramid a multiple of theircurrency on top of their increased stock of pounds. Thus, insteadof checking inflation, a gold-exchange standard encourages allcountries to inflate on top of their increased supply of pounds.Britain, too, is now able to “export” her inflation to other nationswithout paying a price. Thus, in the name of sound money and acheck against inflation, a pseudo gold standard was instituted,designed to induce a double-inverted pyramid of inflation, all ontop of British pounds, the whole process supported by a goldstock that does not dwindle.The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years385"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Since all other countries were sucked into the inflationarygold-exchange trap, it seemed that the only nation Britain hadto worry about was the United States, the only country to con-tinue on a genuine gold standard. That was the reason itbecame so vitally important for Britain to get the United States,through the Morgan connection, to go along with this systemand to inflate, so that Britain would not lose gold to the UnitedStates.For the other nations of Europe, it became an object ofBritish pressure and maneuvering to induce these countriesthemselves to return to a gold standard, with several vital pro-visions: (a) that theircurrencies too be overvalued, so thatBritish exports would not suffer, and British imports would notbe overstimulated—in other words, so that theyjoin Britain inovervaluing their currencies; (b) that each of these countriesadopt their own central bank, with the help of Britain, whichwould inflate their currencies in collaboration with the Bank ofEngland; and (c) that they return, not to a genuine gold stan-dard, but to a gold-exchange standard, keeping their balancesin London and refraining from exercising their legal right toredeem those sterling balances in gold. In this way, for a few years Britain could have its cake and eatit too. It could enjoy the prestige of going back to gold, going backat a highly overvalued pound, and yet continue to pursue aninflationary, cheap-money policy instead of the opposite. It couldinflate pounds and see other countries keep their sterling bal-ances and inflate on top of them; it could induce other countriesto go back to gold at overvalued currencies and to inflate theirmoney supplies;48and it could also try to prop up its flagging386A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II48When the gold-exchange standard broke down in 1931, the econo-mist H.

Not that everycountry was supposed to return to gold at theovervalued, prewar par. The rule of thumb imposed in the 1920swas that (a) currencies, such as that of Britain herself, that haddepreciated up to 60 percent from prewar (for example, theNetherlands and the Scandinavian countries) would return atthe prewar par; (b) currencies that had depreciated from 60 to90 percent were to return to gold within that zone, but at a ratesubstantially above their lowest rate (for example, Belgium,Italy, Czechoslovakia, and France). The French franc, whichhad depreciated to 240 to the pound due to massive inflation,returned to gold at the doubled rate of 124 to the pound. And(c) only those currencies that had been wiped out by devastat-ing hyperinflation, like Austria, Bulgaria, and especially Ger-many, were allowed to return to gold at a realistic rate, andeven they were stabilized at a little bit above their lowest point.As a result, virtually every European currency suffered fromthe requirement to raise the value of its currency artificiallyabove its depreciated level.49The gold-exchange standard was not created de novobyGreat Britain in the interwar period. It is true that a number ofEuropean central banks before 1914 had held foreign exchangereserves in addition to gold, but these were strictly limited, andthey were held as earning assets—these after all were privatelyowned central banks in need of earnings—not as instruments ofmonetary manipulation. But in a few cases, particularly wherethe pyramiding countries were from the Third World, they didfunction as a gold-exchange standard: that is, the Third Worldcurrency pyramided its currency on top of a key country’sreserves (pounds or dollars) instead of on gold. This systembegan in India, after the late 1870s, as a historical accident.

But, as in somany cases of seeming transition, the Indian gold-exchangestandard lingered on, and received great praise for its moderninflationary potential from John Maynard Keynes, then in hisfirst economic post at the India Office. It was Keynes, after leav-ing the India Office and going to Cambridge, who trumpetedthe new form of monetary system as a “limping” or imperfectgold standard but as a “more scientific and economic system,”which he dubbed the gold-exchange standard. As Keynes wrotein February 1910, “it is cheaper to maintain a credit at one of thegreat financial centres of the world, which can be convertedwith great readiness to gold when it is required.“ In a paperdelivered the following year to the Royal Economic Society,Keynes proclaimed that out of this new system would evolve“the ideal currency of the future.” Elaborating his views into his first book, Indian Currency andFinance(London, 1913), Keynes emphasized that the gold-exchange standard was a notable advance because it “econo-mized” on gold internally and internationally, thus allowinggreater “elasticity” of money (a longtime code word for ability toinflate credit) in response to business needs. Looking beyondIndia, Keynes prophetically foresaw the traditional gold standardas giving way to a more “scientific” system based on one or twokey reserve centers. “A preference for a tangible reserve cur-rency,” Keynes declared blithely, “is . . . a relic of a time whengovernments were less trustworthy in these matters than they arenow.”50He also believed that Britain was the natural center of the388A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II50Robert Skidelsky, John Maynard Keynes,vol. 1, 1883–1920 (New York:Viking Press, 1986), p. 275.

In addi-tion, in his work on the commission, Keynes managed to enchanthis doting mentor, Alfred Marshall, the unquestioned ruler ofacademic economists in Britain.51While Montagu Norman was the field marshal of the gold-exchange standard of the 1920s, its major theoretician was long-time Treasury official Ralph Hawtrey. When Hawtrey rose tothe position of director of Financial Enquiries at the Treasury in1919, he delivered a speech before the British Association on“The Gold Standard.” The speech presaged the gold-exchangestandard of the 1920s. Hawtrey sought not only a system ofstable exchange rates as before the war, but also a monetarysystem that would stabilize the world purchasing power ofThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years38951Skidelsky, Keynes, pp. 374–83.

Hawtrey recommended interna-tional cooperation to stabilize price levels, and urged the use ofan index number of world prices, a proposal reminiscent of YaleProfessor Irving Fisher’s suggestion for a “tabular” gold-exchange standard made in 1911. In practice, such calls forprice-level stabilization, which were pursued by BenjaminStrong in the 1920s, were really calls for price inflation, to com-bat the dominant secular trend in a progressing free-marketeconomy of falling prices. In the post–World War I world, this attempt at dual stabili-zation meant that the governments would have to salvage thehigh postwar price levels from the threat of deflation, and inparticular to alleviate the “shortage” of gold compared to theswollen totals of paper currencies existing in Europe. As Pro-fessor Eric Davis writes:There had been concern in official circles that a return to theGold Standard would be inhibited by a shortage of gold.Prices were much higher than before the war, and thus ifthere was a general return to the old parities there might beinsufficient gold. . . . Hawtrey picked up on the idea that theGold Exchange Standard could be widely introduced toeconomise on the use of gold for monetary purposes. Sincecountries would hold foreign exchange, much presumably insterling balances as a substitute for gold, there was a specialadvantage for Britain: the demand for the pound would beincreased at the same time the demand for gold lessened.52The central instrument for imposing the new gold-exchangestandard on Europe was the international financial conferencecalled by the League of Nations at Genoa in the spring of 1922.390A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II52Eric G.

Why can’t the new pseudo gold standard belike the old? Hawtrey makes it clear that his reason is a phobiaabout deflation. The paper money stock had multiplied since1914, and therefore there “has been a great fall in the commod-ity value of gold.” Even in late 1922, after the price fall of the1921 recession, the value of the gold dollar was “only two-thirds of what it was before the war.” Hence, the “danger” of ascramble to secure gold, and a contraction of money andprices. But what is so terrible about deflation? Here, Hawtreyavoids even mentioning the wage rigidity and the unemploy-ment insurance system that had changed the economic face ofBritain. He simply points to the “notorious . . . chronic state ofdepression which prevailed during the spread of the gold stan-dard in the period 1873–1896.” This is really his only horribleexample.But, in the first place, Hawtrey is wrong in attributingfalling prices during the late nineteenth century to a shift fromsilver to gold. The falling prices were due to the industrial rev-olution, and the phenomenal advance of productivity, andhence a drop in price levels, during this period. But a moreimportant error is that Hawtrey has made the all-too-commonmodern error of identifying falling prices with “depression.”In reality, production and living standards were progressing,in Britain and the United States, during this period, costs werefalling and therefore there was no squeeze on profits.

Thus, in dis-cussing the key currency countries, Hawtrey states wistfully,“At the gold centres some gold reserves must be maintained.”But if the gold standard becomes worldwide, “if all the goldstandard countries adhere to it, gold will nowhere be needed asa means of remittance, and gold will only be withdrawn fromthe reserves for use as a raw material of industry.”59In short,Hawtrey looked forward to dispensing with gold as a monetarymetal altogether, and to have the world solely on a fiat paperstandard.Hawtrey concludes his essay by conceding that there wasonly one defect in the Genoa resolutions: that there was no men-tion of how long it would take to return to gold. Even thestrongest countries, he emphasized, would have to wait untiltheir currencies rose on the exchange market to equal their des-ignated rates. To induce a rise in pound sterling to meet thehigh fixed rate, Britain would either have to deflate, or else for-eign countries, especially the United States, would have toinflate to correct the international discrepancy. “Further defla-tion,” declaimed Hawtrey, “is out of the question.” Thereforethe only hope was to “stabilize our currency at its existing pur-chasing power,” and wait for the increased gold supply in theUnited States to lead to a substantial inflation in the UnitedStates.60Like the other British leaders, Hawtrey was pinning hisfaith on Uncle Sam’s inflating enough to “help Britain.”61396A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II58Thus, see the illuminating work by S.B.

In the words of Professor Davis, “the widespread adop-tion of the Gold Exchange Standard can be seen as the legacy ofGenoa.”65Following the Genoa model, Great Britain, as we have seen,set up the gold-exchange system by returning to its new versionof gold in 1925; the other European countries, as well as othernations, followed, each at its own pace. By early 1926, someform of gold standard was established, at least de facto, in 39countries. By 1928, 43 nations were de jure on the gold standard.Of these, even the few allegedly on the gold bullion standardsuch as France, kept most of their reserves in sterling balancesin London, and the same is true of officially gold-coin nationssuch as the Netherlands. Apart from the United States, the onlyofficially gold-coin countries were minor nations on the worldperiphery, such as Mexico, Colombia, Cuba, and the Union ofSouth Africa.66It should be noted that Norway and Denmark,who insisted in following the Genoa path of struggling back togold at a highly overvalued currency, suffered, like Britain,from an export depression throughout the 1920s; whereas Fin-land, acting on better advice, went back at a realistically deval-ued rate, and avoided chronic depression during this period.67398A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II64Ibid., p. 36.65Davis, “R.G.

The crucialBritish export industries, chronically whipsawed between anovervalued pound and rigidly high wage rates kept up bystrong, militant unions and widespread unemployment insur-ance, kept slumping during an era when worldwide trade andexports were prospering. Unemployment remained chronicallyhigh. The unemployment rate had hovered around 3 percentfrom 1851 to 1914. From 1921 through 1926 it had averaged 12percent; and unemployment did little better after the return togold. In April 1925, when Britain returned to gold, the unem-ployment rate stood at 10.9 percent. After the return, it fluctu-ated sharply, but always at historically very high levels. Thus,in the year after return, unemployment climbed above 12 per-cent, fell back to 9 percent, and jumped to over 14 percent dur-ing most of 1926. Unemployment fell back to 9 percent by thesummer of 1927, but hovered around 10 to 11 percent for thenext two years.

The pattern of the slump in British exports may beseen by some comparative data. If 1924 is set equal to 100,world exports had risen to 132 by 1929, while Western Euro-pean exports had similarly risen to 134. United States exportshad also risen to 130. Yet, amid this worldwide prosperity,Great Britain lagged far behind, exports rising only to 109. Onthe other hand, British imports roseto 113 in the same period.After the 1929 crash until 1931, all exports fell considerably,world exports to 113, Western European to 107, and the UnitedStates, which had taken the brunt of the 1929 crash, to 91; andyet, while British imports rose slightly from 1929 to 1931 to114, its exports drastically fell to 68. In this way, the overval-ued pound combined with rigid downward wage rates towork their dire effects in both boom and recession. Overall,whereas, in 1931, Western European and world exports wereconsiderably higher than in 1924, British exports were verysharply lower.Within categories of British exports, there was a sharp andilluminating separation between two sets of industries: the old,unionized export staples in the north of England, and thenewer, relatively nonunion, lower-wage industries in the south.These newer industries were able to flourish and provide plen-tiful employment because they were permitted to hire workersat a lower hourly wage than the industries of the north.71Someof these industries, such as public utilities, flourished becausethey were not dependent on exports. But even the exports fromthese new, relatively nonunionized industries did very wellduring this period.

During the 1929–31 recession, exports ofthese new industries did relatively better than the old: machin-ery and electrical exports falling to 28 percent and 22 percentrespectively below the 1924 level, while chemical exports fellonly to 5 percent below and automobile exports remained com-fortably in 1931 at fully 26 percent above1924. On the other hand, the older, staple export industries, the tra-ditional mainstays of British prosperity, fared very badly inboth these periods of boom and recession. The nonferrous metalindustry rose only slightly by 14 percent by 1928–29 and thenfell to 55 percent of 1924 in the next two years. In even worseshape were the once-mighty cotton and woolen textile indus-tries, the bellwethers of the Industrial Revolution in England.From 1924 to 1929, cotton exports fell by 10 percent, and woolensby 20 percent, and then, in the two years to 1931, they plum-meted phenomenally, cottons to 50 percent of 1924 and woolensto 46 percent. Remarkably, cotton and woolen exports were atthis point their lowest in volume since the 1870s.Perhaps the worst problem was in the traditionally promi-nent export, coal. Coal exports had declined to 69 percent of1924 volume in 1931; but perhaps more ominously, they hadfallen to 88 percent in 1928–29, slumping, like textiles, in themidst of worldwide prosperity.So high were British price levels compared to other countries, inboth of these periods, that Britain’s imports, remarkably, rose inevery category during boom and recession. Thus, imports ofmanufactured goods into Britain rose by 32.5 percent from 1924to 1928–29, and then rose another 5 percent until 1931. So costly,too, was the once-proud British iron and steel industry that,after 1925, the British, for the first time in their history, becamenet importersof iron and steel. The relative rigidity of wage costs in Britain may be seen bycomparing their unit wage costs with the U.S., setting 1925 ineach country equal to 100.

Swedish wages were even more flexible in thoseyears, enabling Sweden to surmount without export depres-sion and return to gold at the prewar par. Swedish wage ratesfell to 88 in 1928, 80 in 1929, and 70 in 1931. In Great Britain,on the other hand, wage rates remained stubbornly high, inthe face of falling prices, being 97 in 1928, 95 the followingyear, and down to only 90 in 1931.72In contrast, wholesaleprices in England fell by 8 percent in 1926 and 1927, and moresharply still thereafter.The blindness of British officialdom to the downward rigid-ity of wage rates was quite remarkable. Thus, the powerfuldeputy controller of finance for the Treasury, Frederick W.Leith-Ross, the major architect of what became known as the“Treasury view,” wrote in bewilderment to Hawtrey in earlyAugust 1928, wondering at Keynes’s claim that wage rates hadremained stable since 1925. In view of the substantial decline inprices in those years, wrote Leith-Ross, “I should have thoughtthat the average wage rate showed a substantial decline duringthe past four years.” Leith-Ross could only support his view bychallenging the wage index as inaccurate, citing his own figuresthat aggregate payrolls had declined. Leith-Ross doesn’t seem tohave realized that this was precisely the problem: that keepingwage rates up in the face of declining money may indeed lowerpayrolls, but by creating unemployment and the lowering ofhours worked. Finally, by the spring of 1929, Leith-Ross wasforced to face reality, and conceded the point. At last, Leith-Rossadmitted that the problem was rigidity of labor costs:If our workmen were prepared to accept a reduction of 10percent in their wages or increase their efficiency by 10 per-cent, a large proportion of our present unemployment couldbe overcome. But in fact organized labor is so attached to themaintenance of the present standard of wages and hours ofThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years40372Moggridge, British Monetary Policy, pp. 117–25."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"labor that they would prefer that a million workers shouldremain in idleness and be maintained permanently out ofthe Employment Fund, than accept any sacrifice. The resultis to throw on to the capital and managerial side of industrya far larger reorganization than would be necessary: anduntil labor is prepared to contribute in larger measure to theprocess of reconstruction, there will inevitably be unemploy-ment.73Leith-Ross might have added that the “preference” forunemployment was made not by the unemployed themselvesbut by the union leadership on their alleged behalf, a leadershipwhich itself did not have to face the unemployment dole. More-over, the willingness of the workers to accept this deal mighthave been very different if there were no generous EmploymentFund for them to tap.It was in fact the highly militant coal miners’ union, led bythe prominent leftist Aneurin “Nye” Bevan, that was the first tostir up grave doubt about the glory of the British return to gold.Not only was coal a highly unionized export industry located inthe north, but already overinflated coal-mining wages had beengiven an extra boost during the first Labor government of Ram-say MacDonald, in 1924. In addition to the high wage rates, theminers’ union insisted on numerous cost-raising restrictive,featherbedding practices, some of them resurrected from thedefunct postmedieval guilds. These obstructionist tacticshelped rigidify the British economy, preventing changes andadaptations of occupation and location, and hampering ration-alizing and innovative managerial practices. As Professor Ben-ham trenchantly pointed out:Employers who wished to make changes had to face thepowerful opposition of organized labor. The introduction ofnew methods, such as the “more looms to a weaver” system,404A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II73Draft memorandum to Chancellor of Exchequer Churchill, April 1929.Clarke, “Treasury’s Analytical Model,” p. 186.

Aplumber could repair a pipe conveying cold water; if it con-veyed hot water, he had to call in a hot water engineer. Entryinto certain occupations was rendered difficult. A man canbecome an efficient building operative in a few months; anapprenticeship of four years was required. British railwayscould not have their labour force as they chose. A host ofrestrictions, insisted upon by the Trade Unions, made thisimpossible.74By 1925, the year of the return to gold, British coal wasalready facing competition of rehabilitated, newly modernized,low-cost coal mines in France, Belgium, and Germany. Britishcoal was no longer competitive, and its exports were slumpingbadly. The Baldwin government appointed a royal commission,headed by Sir Herbert Samuel, to study the vexed coal question.The Samuel Commission reported in March 1926, urging thatminers accept a moderate cut in wages, and an increase inworking hours at current pay, and suggesting that a substantialnumber of miners move to other areas, such as the south, whereemployment opportunities were greater. But this was not thesort of rational solution that would appeal to the spoiled, mili-tant unions, who rejected those proposals and went on strike,thereby generating the traumatic and abortive general strike of1926.The strike was broken, and coal-mining wages fell slightly, butthe victory for rationality was all too pyrrhic.

But instead of identifying the problem as inflationism,cheap money, and the gold bullion–gold-exchange standard inthe face of an overvalued pound, Beaverbrook and British publicopinion pointed to “hard money” as the villain responsible forrecession and unemployment. Instead of tightening the moneysupply and interest rates in order to preserve its own createdgold standard, the British Establishment was moved to follow itsown inclinations still further: to step up its disastrous commit-ment to inflation and cheap money.75During the general strike, Britain was forced to import coalfrom Europe instead of exporting it. In olden times, the largefall in export income would have brought about a severe liqui-dation of credit, contracting the money supply and loweringprices and wage rates. But the British banks, caught up as theywere in the ideology of inflationism, instead expanded credit ona lavish scale, and sterling balances piled up on the continent ofEurope. “Instead of a readjustment of prices and costs in Eng-land and a breaking up of the rigidities, England by creditexpansion held the fort and continued the rigidities.”76The massive monetary inflation in Britain during 1926caused gold to flow out of the country, especially to the UnitedStates, and sterling balances to accumulate in foreign countries,especially in France. In the true gold-standard days, Britainwould have taken all this as a furious signal to contract andtighten up; instead it persisted in continuing inflationism andcheap money, lowering its crucial “bank rate” (Bank of Englanddiscount rate) from 5 percent to 4.5 percent in April 1927. Thisaction further weakened the pound sterling, and Britain lost $11million in gold during the next two months. France’s important role during the gold-exchange era hasserved as a convenient whipping boy for the British and for the406A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II75Palyi, Twilight of Gold, pp. 102–04.76Anderson, Economics and Public Welfare, p. 167."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Establishment ever since. The legend has it that France was thespoiler, by returning to gold at an undervalued franc (peggingthe franc first in 1926, and then officially returning to gold twoyears later), consequently piling up sterling balances, and thenbreaking the gold-exchange system by insisting that Britainpay in gold. The reality was very different. France, during andafter World War I, suffered severe hyperinflation, fueled bymassive government deficits. As a result, the French franc, clas-sically set at 19.3¢ under the old gold standard, had plungeddown to 5¢ in May 1925, and accelerated its decline to 1.94¢ inlate July 1926. By June 1926, Parisian mobs protesting the run-away inflation and depreciation surrounded the Chamber ofDeputies, threatening violence if former Premier RaymondPoincaré, known as a staunch monetary and fiscal conserva-tive, was not returned to his post. Poincaré was returned tooffice July 2, pledging to cut expenses, balance the budget, andsave the franc.Armed with a popular mandate, Poincaré was prepared todrive through any necessary monetary and fiscal reforms. Poin-caré’s every instinct urged him to return to gold at the prewarpar, a course that would have been disastrous for France, beingnot only highly deflationary but also saddling French taxpayerswith a massive public debt. Furthermore, returning to gold atthe prewar par would have left the Bank of France with a verylow (8.6-percent) gold reserve to bank notes in circulation.Returning at par, of course, would have gladdened the hearts ofFrench bondholders as well as of Montagu Norman and theBritish Establishment. Poincaré was talked out of this path,however, by the knowledgeable and highly perceptive EmileMoreau, governor of the Bank of France, and by Moreau’sdeputy governor, distinguished economist Charles Rist.Moreau and Rist were well aware of the chronic export depres-sion and unemployment that the British were suffering becauseof their stubborn insistence on the prewar par.

To avoidany further rise, the French government quickly stabilized thefranc de facto at 3.92¢ on December 26, and then returned dejure to gold at the same rate on June 25, 1928.77At the end of 1926, while the franc was now pegged, Francewas not yet on a genuine gold standard. Officially, and de jure,the franc was still set at the prewar par, when one gold ouncehad been set at approximately 100 francs. But now, at the newpegged value, the gold ounce, in foreign exchange, was worth500 francs. Obviously, no one would now deposit gold at aFrench bank in return for 100 paper francs, thereby wiping out80 percent of his assets. Also, the Bank of France (which was aprivately owned firm) could not buy gold at the current expen-sive rate, for fear that the French government might decide,after all, to go back to gold de jure at a higher rate, therebyinflicting a severe loss on its gold holdings.

In that way, foreign exchange holdings of the Bank ofFrance skyrocketed rapidly, rising from a minuscule sum in thesummer of 1926 to no less than $1 billion in October of the fol-lowing year. Most of these balances were in the form of sterling(in bank deposits and short-term bills), which had piled up onthe continent during the massive British monetary inflation of1926 and now moved into French hands with the advent ofupward speculation in the franc, and with continued inflationof the pound. Willy-nilly, and against their will, therefore, theFrench found themselves in the same boat as the rest of Europe:on the gold-exchange or gold-sterling standard.78If France had gone onto a genuine gold standard at the endof 1926, gold would have flowed out of England to France, forc-ing contraction in England and forcing the British to raise inter-est rates. The inflow of gold into France and the increased issueof francs for gold by the Bank of France would also have tem-porarily lowered interest rates there. As it was, French interestrates were sharply lowered in response to the massive issue offrancs, but no contraction or tightening was experienced inEngland; quite the contrary.79Moreau, Rist, and the other Bank of France officials werealert to the dangers of their situation, and they tried to act inlieu of the gold standard by reducing their sterling balances,partly by demanding gold in London, and partly by exchang-ing sterling for dollars in New York.This situation put considerable pressure upon the pound,and caused a drain of gold out of England.

And so,Norman tried his best to use muscle to prevent France fromexercising its own property rights and redeeming sterling ingold, and absurdly urged that sterling was beneficial for France,and that they could not have too much sterling. On the otherhand, he threatened to go off gold altogether if France per-sisted—a threat he was to make good four years later. He alsoinvoked the spectre of France’s World War I debts to Britain.80He tried to get various European central banks to put pressureon the Bank of France not to take gold from London. The Bankof France found that it could sell up to £3 million a day withoutattracting the angry attention of the Bank of England; but anymore sales than that would call forth immediate protest. As oneofficial of the Bank of France said bitterly in 1927, “London is afree gold market, and that means that anybody is free to buygold in London except the Bank of France.”81Why did France pile up foreign exchange balances? The anti-French myth of the Establishment charges that the franc wasundervalued at the new rate of 3.92¢, and that therefore theensuing export surplus brought foreign exchange balances intoFrance. The facts of the case were precisely the reverse. BeforeWorld War I, France traditionally had a deficit in its balance oftrade. During the post–World War I inflation, as usually occurswith fiat money, the foreign exchange rate rose more rapidlythan domestic prices, since the highly liquid foreign exchangemarket is particularly quick to anticipate and discount thefuture.

Thus, in 1928,French exports were only 96.1 percent of imports. On the sim-plistic-trade, or relative-purchasing-power criterion, then, wewould have to say that the post-1926 franc was over- rather thanundervalued. Why didn’t gold or foreign exchange flow out ofFrance? For the same reason as before World War I; the chronictrade deficits were covered by perennial “invisible” net rev-enues into France, in particular the flourishing tourist trade.What then accounted for the amassing of sterling by France?The inflow of capital into France. During the French hyperin-flation, capital had left France in droves to escape the depreci-ating franc, much of it finding a haven in London. When Poin-caré put his monetary and budget reforms into effect in 1926,capital happily reversed its flow, and left London for France,anticipating a rising or at least a stable franc.In fact, rather than being obstreperous, the French, suc-cumbing to the blandishments and threats of Montagu Nor-man, were overly cooperative, much against their better judg-ment. Thus, Norman warned Moreau in December 1927 thatif he persisted in trying to redeem sterling in gold, Normanwould devalue the pound. In fact, Poincaré propheticallywarned Moreau in May 1927 that sterling’s position hadweakened and that England might all too readily give up onits own gold standard. And when France stabilized the francde jure at the end of June 1928, foreign exchange constituted55 percent of the total reserves of the Bank of France (withgold at 45 percent), an extraordinarily high proportion of thatin sterling. Furthermore, much of the funds deposited by theBank of France in London and New York were used for stockmarket loans and fueled stock speculation; worse, much ofthe sterling balances were recycled to repurchase Frenchfrancs, which continued the accumulation of sterling balancesin France. It is no wonder that Dr. Palyi concludes that [i]t was at Norman’s urgent request that the French centralbank carried a weak sterling on its back well beyond theThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years411"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"limit of what a central bank could reasonably afford to dounder the circumstances.

The British, we remem-ber, were counting heavily on America’s continuing price infla-tion, to keep British gold out of American shores. But instead,American prices were falling slowly but steadily during 1925and 1926, in response to the great outpouring of Americanproducts. The gold-exchange standard was being endangeredby one of its crucial players before it had scarcely begun!So, Norman decided to fall back on his trump card, the oldmagic of the Norman-Strong connection. Benjamin Strongmust, once more, rush to the rescue of Great Britain! AfterNorman turned for help to his old friend Strong, the latterinvited the world’s four leading central bankers to a top-secret conference in New York in July 1927. In addition toNorman and Strong, the conference was attended by DeputyGovernor Rist of the Bank of France and Dr. Hjalmar Schacht,governor of the German Reichsbank. Strong ran the Americanside with an iron hand, keeping the Federal Reserve Board inWashington in the dark, and even refusing to let GatesMcGarrah, chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bankof New York, attend the meeting. Strong and Norman triedtheir best to have the four nations embark on a coordinatedpolicy of monetary inflation and cheap money. Rist demurred,412A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II83Ibid., p. 187.

All this urging was tono avail, Norman being committed to a cheap-money policy.

Strong, in turn, agreed to supplyFrance with gold at a subsidized rate: as cheap as the cost ofbuying it from England, despite the far higher transportationcosts.85Schacht was even more adamant, expressing his alarm atthe extent to which bank credit expansion had already gone inEngland and the United States. The previous year, Schacht hadacted on his concerns by reducing his sterling holdings to aminimum and increasing the holdings of gold in the Reichs-bank. He told Strong and Norman: “Don’t give me a low[interest] rate. Give me a true rate. Give me a true rate, andthen I shall know how to keep my house in order.”86There-upon, Schacht and Rist sailed for home, leaving Strong andNorman to plan the next round of coordinated inflation them-selves. In particular, Strong agreed to embark on a mightyinflationary push in the United States, lowering interest ratesand expanding credit—an agreement which Rist, in his mem-oirs, maintains had already been privately concluded beforethe four-power conference began. Indeed, Strong gaily toldRist during their meeting that he was going to give “a littlecoup de whiskeyto the stock market.”87Strong also agreed tobuy $60 million more of sterling from England to prop up thepound.Pursuant to the agreement with Norman, the FederalReserve promptly launched its greatest burst of inflation andcheap credit in the second half of 1927. This period saw theThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years41385Ibid.86Anderson, Economics and Public Welfare,p. 181.

Benjamin Strongdecided to sucker the suspicious regional Federal Reservebanks by using Kansas City Fed Governor W.J. Bailey as thestalking horse for the rate-cut policy. Instead of the New YorkFed initiating the rediscount rate cut from 4 percent to 3.5 per-cent, Strong talked the trusting Bailey into taking the lead onJuly 29, with New York and the other regional Feds followinga week or two later. Strong told Bailey that the purpose of therate cuts was to help the farmers, a theme likely to appeal toBailey’s agricultural region. He made sure notto tell Bailey thatthe major purpose was to help England pursue its inflationarygold-exchange policy.The Chicago Fed, however, balked at lowering its rates, andStrong got the Federal Reserve Board in Washington to force itto do so in September. The isolationist Chicago Tribuneangrilycalled for Strong’s resignation, charging correctly that discountrates were being lowered in the interests of Great Britain.88After generating the burst of inflation in 1927, the New YorkFed continued, over the next two years, to do its best: buyingheavily in prime commercial bills of foreign countries, billsendorsed by foreign central banks. The purpose was to bolsterforeign currencies, and to prevent an inflow of gold into theU.S. The New York Fed also bought large amounts of sterlingbills in 1927 and 1929.

Mellon, secretary ofthe Treasury throughout the Republican era of the 1920s, waslong closely allied with the Morgan interests. As early as March1927, Mellon assured everyone that “an abundant supply ofeasy money” would continue to be available, and he and Pres-ident Coolidge repeatedly acted as the “capeadoresof WallStreet,” giving numerous newspaper interviews urging stockprices upward whenever prices seemed to flag. And in January1928, the Treasury announced that it would refund a 4.5-percentLiberty Bond issue, falling due in September, in 3.5-percentnotes. Within the administration, Mellon was consistentlyStrong’s staunchest supporter. The only sharp critic of Strong’sinflationism within the administration was Secretary of Com-merce Herbert C. Hoover, only to be met by Mellon’s denounc-ing Hoover’s “alarmism” and interference.90The motivation for Benjamin Strong’s expansionary policyof the late 1920s was neatly summed up in a letter by one of histop aides to one of Montagu Norman’s top henchmen, SirArthur Salter, then director of Economic and Financial Organi-zation for the League of Nations. The aide noted that Strong, inthe spring of 1928, “said that very few people indeed realizedthat we were now paying the penalty for the decision whichwas reached early in 1924 to help the rest of the world back toThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years41589Clark, Central Banking Under the Federal Reserve, p. 198.90Unfortunately, Hoover shortsightedly attacked only credit expan-sion in the stock marketrather than credit expansion per se.

Parker Willis in the autumn of 1926 thatbad consequences would follow America’s cheap-money pol-icy, but that “that cannot be helped. It is the price we must payfor helping Europe.” Of course, the price paid by Strong and hisallies was not so “onerous,” at least in the short run, when wenote, as Dr. Clark pointed out, that the cheap credit aided espe-cially those speculative, financial, and investment bankinginterests with whom Strong was allied—notably, of course, theNorman complex.92The British, as early as mid-1926, knewenough to be appreciative. Thus, the influential London jour-nal, The Banker, wrote of Strong that “no better friend of Eng-land” existed. The Bankerpraised the “energy and skillfulnessthat he has given to the service of England,” and exulted that“his name should be associated with that of Mr. [Walter Hines]Page as a friend of England in her greatest need.”93On the other hand, Morgan partner Russell C. Leffingwellwas not nearly as sanguine about the Strong-Norman policy ofjoint credit expansion. When, in the spring of 1929, Leffingwellheard reports that Monty was getting “panicky” about the spec-ulative boom in Wall Street, he impatiently told fellow Morganpartner Thomas W. Lamont, “Monty and Ben sowed the wind.I expect we shall all have to reap the whirlwind. . . .

A sickly man, Strong in effect was notrunning the Fed throughout 1928, finally dying on October 16of that year. He was succeeded by his handpicked choice,George L. Harrison, also a Morgan man but lacking the per-sonal and political clout of Benjamin Strong.At first, as in 1924, Strong’s monetary inflation was temp-orarily successful in accomplishing Britain’s goals. Sterling wasstrengthened, and the American gold inflow from Britain wassharply reversed, gold flowing outward. Farm produce prices,which had risen from an index of 100 in 1924 to 110 the follow-ing year, and had then slumped back to 100 in 1926 and 99 in1927, now jumped up to 106 the following year. Farm and foodexports spurted upward, and foreign loans in the United Stateswere stimulated to new heights, reaching a peak in mid-1928.But, once again, the stimulus was only temporary. By the sum-mer of 1928, the pound sterling was sagging again. Americanfarm prices fell slightly in 1929, and agricultural exports fell inthe same year. Foreign lending slumped badly, as both domes-tic and foreign funds poured into the booming American stockmarket.The stock market had already been booming by the time ofthe fatal injection of credit expansion in the latter half of 1927.The Standard and Poor’s industrial common stock index, whichhad been 44.4 at the beginning of the 1920s boom in June 1921,had more than doubled to 103.4 by June 1927. Standard andPoor’s rail stocks had risen from 156.0 in June 1921 to 316.2 in1927, and public utilities from 66.6 to 135.1 in the same period.Dow Jones industrials had doubled from 95.1 in November1922 to 195.4 in November 1927. But now, the massive Fedcredit expansion in late 1927 ignited the stock market fire. Inparticular, throughout the 1920s, the Fed deliberately andunwisely stimulated the stock market by keeping the “call rate,”that is, the interest rate on bank call loans to the stock market,artificially low. Before the establishment of the Federal ReserveSystem, the call rate frequently had risen far above 100 percent,The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years417"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"when a stock market boom became severe; yet in the historic andvirtually runaway stock market boom of 1928–29, the call ratenever went above 10 percent. The call rates were controlled atthese low levels by the New York Fed, in close collaborationwith, and at the advice of, the Money Committee of the NewYork Stock Exchange.95The stock market, during 1928 and1929, went into overdrive, virtually doubling these two years.The Dow went up to 376.2 on August 29, 1929, and Standardand Poor’s industrials rose to 195.2, rails to 446.0, and publicutilities to 375.1 in September. Credit expansion always con-centrates its booms in titles to capital, in particular stocks andreal estate, and in the late 1920s, bank credit propelled a mas-sive real estate boom in New York City, in Florida, andthroughout the country. These included excessive mortgageloans and construction from farms to Manhattan office build-ings.96The Federal Reserve authorities, now concerned about thestock market boom, tried feebly to tighten the money supplyduring 1928, but they failed badly. The Fed’s sales of govern-ment securities were offset by two factors: (a) the banks shiftingtheir depositors from demand deposits to “time” deposits,which required a much lower rate of reserves, and which werereally savings deposits redeemable de facto on demand, ratherthan genuine time loans, and (b) more important, the fruit of thedisastrous Fed policy of virtually creating a market in bankers’acceptances, a market which had existed in Europe but not inthe United States. The Fed’s policy throughout the 1920s was tosubsidize and in effect create an acceptance market by standing418A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II95Rothbard, America’s Great Depression, p. 116; Clarke, Central BankingUnder the Federal Reserve,p. 382; Adolph C.

Hence, whenbank reserves tightened as the Fed sold securities in 1928, thebanks simply shifted to the acceptance market, expanding theirreserves by selling acceptances to the Fed. Thus, the Fed’s sell-ing of $390 million of securities was partially offset, during lat-ter 1928, by its purchase of nearly $330 million of acceptances.97The Fed’s sticking to this inflationary policy in 1928 was nowmade easier by adopting the fallacious “qualitativist” view,held as we have seen also by Herbert Hoover, that the Fedcould dampen down the boom by restricting loans to the stockmarket while merrily continuing to inflate in the acceptancemarket.In addition to pouring in funds through acceptances, the Feddid nothing to tighten its rediscount market. The Fed dis-counted $450 million of bank bills during the first half of 1928;it finally tightened a bit by raising its rediscount rates from 3.5percent at the beginning of the year to 5 percent in July. Afterthat, it stubbornly refused to raise the rediscount rate any fur-ther, keeping it there until the end of the boom. As a result, Feddiscounts to banks rose slightly until the end of the boominstead of declining. Furthermore, the Fed failed to sell anymore of its hoard of $200 million of government securities afterJuly 1928; instead, it bought some securities on balance duringthe rest of the year.Why was Fed policy so supine in late 1928 and in 1929? A cru-cial reason was that Europe, and particularly England, havinglost the benefit of the inflationary impetus by mid-1928, wasclamoring against any tighter money in the U.S. The easing inlate 1928 prevented gold inflows from the U.S. from getting verylarge. Britain was again losing gold; sterling was again weak;and the United States once again bowed to its wish to see Europeavoid the consequences of its own inflationary policies.

Repeatedly, both Coolidge and Mellonannounced that the country was in a “new era” of permanentprosperity and permanently rising stock prices. On November16, the New York Timesdeclared that the administration in Wash-ington was the source of most of the bullish news and noted thegrowing “impression that Washington may be depended uponto furnish a fresh impetus for the stock market.” The adminis-tration continued these bullish statements for the next twoyears.

France, having unwillingly piled up $450 million in ster-ling by the end of June 1928, was anxious to redeem sterling forgold, and indeed sold $150 million of sterling by mid-1929. Indeference to Norman’s threats and pleas, however, the Bank ofFrance sold that sterling for dollars rather than for gold in Lon-don. Indeed, so cowed were the French that (a) French sales ofsterling in 1929–31 were offset by sterling purchases by a num-ber of minor countries, and (b) Norman managed to persuadethe Bank of France to sell no more sterling until after the dis-astrous day in September 1931 when Britain abandoned its owngold-exchange standard and went on to a fiat pound standard.100Meanwhile, despite the great inflation of money and credit inthe U.S., the massive increase in the supply of goods in the U.S.continued to lower prices gradually, wholesale prices fallingfrom 104.5 (1926=100) in November 1925 to 100 in 1926, andthen to 95.2 in June 1929. Consumer price indices in the U.S.also fell gradually in the late 1920s. Thus, despite Strong’s loosemoney policies, Norman could not count on price inflation inthe U.S. to bail out his gold-exchange system. Montagu Nor-man, in addition to pleading with the U.S. to keep inflating,resorted to dubious short-run devices to try to keep gold fromflowing out to the U.S. Thus, in 1928 and 1929, he would sellgold for sterling to raise the sterling rate a bit, in sales timed tocoincide with the departure of fast boats from London to NewYork, thus inducing gold holders to keep the precious metal inLondon. Such short-run tricks were hardly adequate substitutesfor tight money or for raising bank rate in England, and weak-ened long-run confidence in the pound sterling.101The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years421earlier shifted to become economic adviser of the Bank of England, andhad written to Strong warning of unduly tight restriction on Americanbank credit.

None of these superficial methods couldbe effective.Professor Beckhart added another reason for the adoption ofthe ineffective policy of moral suasion: that the administrationhad been persuaded to try this tack by the old manipulator,Montagu Norman. Finally, by June 1929, the moral suasion wasat last abandoned, but discount rates were still not raised, sothat the stock market boom continued to rage, even as theeconomy in general was quietly but inexorably turning down-ward. Secretary Mellon once again trumpeted our “unbrokenand unbreakable prosperity.” In August, the Federal ReserveBoard finally agreed to raise the rediscount rate to 6 percent,but any tightening effect was more than offset by the Fed’ssimultaneously lowering its acceptance rate, thereby onceagain giving an inflationary fillip to the acceptance market.One reason for this resumption of acceptance inflation, after ithad been previously reversed in March, was, yet again,“another visit of Governor Norman.”104Thus, once more, thecloven hoof of Montagu Norman was able to give its finalimpetus to the boom of the 1920s. Great Britain was also enter-ing upon a depression, and yet its inflationary policies resultedin a serious outflow of gold in June and July.

The Fed inflated partly to help Britain and partlyfor its own sake. During the week of the great stock marketcrash—the final week of October 1929—the Federal Reserve,specifically George Harrison, doubled its holding of govern-ment securities, and discounted $200 million for member banks.During that one week, the Fed added $300 million to bankreserves, the expansion being generated to prevent stock mar-ket liquidation and to permit the New York City banks to takeover brokers’ loans being liquidated by nonbank lenders. Overthe objections of Roy Young of the Federal Reserve Board, Har-rison told the New York Stock Exchange that “I am ready toprovide all the reserve funds that may be needed.”106ByDecember, Secretary Mellon issued one of his traditionally opti-mistic pronouncements that there was “plenty of credit avail-able,” and President Hoover, addressing a business conferenceon December 5, hailed the nation’s good fortune in possessingThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years425106Chernow, House of Morgan, p. 319."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"the splendid Federal Reserve System, which had succeeded insaving shaky banks, had restored confidence, and had madecapital more abundant by reducing interest rates.In early 1930, the Fed launched a massive cheap-money pro-gram, lowering rediscount rates during the year from 4.5 per-cent to 2 percent, with acceptance rates and call loan ratesfalling similarly. The Fed purchased $218 million in governmentsecurities, increasing total member bank reserves by over $100million.

Gates W.McGarrah resigned his post as chairman of the board of theNew York Fed in February 1930 to assume the position of pres-ident of the BIS, and Jackson E. Reynolds, a director of the NewYork Fed, was chairman of the BIS’s first organizing committee.J.P. Morgan and Company unsurprisingly supplied much of thecapital for the BIS.

But the run on the Germanbanks, both from the German people as well as from foreigncreditors, proved devastating. By mid-July, the German bank-ing system collapsed from internal runs, and Germany went offthe gold standard. Since the German public feared runawayinflation above all else and identified the cause of the inflationas exchange-rate devaluation, the German government felt ithad to maintain the par value of the mark, now highly overval-ued relative to gold. To do so, while at the same time resuminginflationary credit expansion, the German government had to“protect” the mark by severe and thoroughgoing exchange con-trols.With the successful runs on Austria and Germany, it wasclear that England would be the next to suffer a worldwide lackof confidence in its currency, including runs on gold. Sureenough, in mid-July, sterling redemption in gold became severe,and the Bank of England lost $125 million in gold in nine daysin late July. The remedy to such a situation under the classical gold stan-dard was very clear: a sharp rise in bank rate to tighten Englishmoney and to attract gold and foreign capital to stay or flowback into England. In classical gold standard crises, the bankhad raised its bank rate to 9 or 10 percent until the crises passed.And yet, so wedded was England to cheap money, that itentered the crisis in mid-July at the absurdly low bank rate of2.5 percent, and grudgingly raised the rate only to 4.5 percentby the end of July, keeping the rate at this low level until itfinally threw in the towel and, on the black Sunday of Septem-ber 20, went off the very gold-exchange standard that it recently428A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"had foisted upon the rest of the world. Indeed, instead of tight-ening money, the Bank of England made the pound shakier stillby inflating credit further. Thus, in the last two weeks of July,the Bank of England purchased nearly $115 million in govern-ment securities.England disgracefully threw in the towel even as foreigncentral banks tried to prop the Bank of England up and save thegold-exchange standard. Answering Norman’s pleas, the Bankof France and the New York Fed each loaned the Bank of Eng-land $125 million on August 1, and then, later in August,another $400 million provided by a consortium of French andAmerican bankers. All this aid was allowed to go down thedrain on the altar of inflationism and a 4.5-percent bank rate. AsDr. Anderson concluded, England went off the gold standard with Bank Rate at 4.5percent. To a British banker in 1913, this would have been anincredible thing. . . . The collapse of the gold standard inEngland was absolutely unnecessary. It was the product ofprolonged violation of gold standard rules, and, even at theend, it could have been averted by the return to orthodoxgold standard methods.108England betrayed not only the countries that aided thepound, but also the countries it had cajoled into adopting thegold-exchange standard in the 1920s. It also specifically betrayedthose banks it had persuaded to keep huge sterling balances inLondon: specifically, the Netherlands Bank and the Bank ofFrance. Indeed, on Friday, September 18, Dr. G. Vissering, headof the Netherlands Bank, phoned Monty Norman and asked himabout the crisis of sterling. Vissering, who was poised to with-draw massive sterling balances from London, was assured with-out qualification by his old friend Norman that, England would,at all costs, remain on the gold standard. Two days later, Eng-land betrayed its word. The Netherlands Bank suffered severeThe Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years429108Anderson, Economics and Public Welfare, p. 248.

In its own defense, the bank quoted repeated assur-ances from the Bank of England about the safety of foreign fundsin London. The bank made it clear that it was betrayed anddeceived by the Bank of England.110The Bank of France also suffered severely from the Britishbetrayal, losing about $95 million. Despite its misgivings, ithad loyally supported the English gold-standard system byallowing sterling balances to pile up. The Bank of France soldno sterling until after England went off gold; by September1931, it had amassed a sterling portfolio of $300 million, one-fifth of France’s monetary reserves. In fact, during the period of1928–31, the sterling portfolio of the Bank of France was attimes equal to two-thirds of the entire gold reserve of the Bankof England.Despite Montagu Norman, who began to blame the Frenchgovernment for his own egregious failure, it was not theFrench authorities who put pressure on sterling in 1931. Onthe contrary, it was the shrewd private French investors andcommercial banks, who, correctly sensing the weakness ofsterling and the British refusal to employ orthodox measuresin its support, decided to make a run on the pound inexchange for gold.111The run was aggravated by the glaringfact that Britain had a chronic import deficit, and also wasscarcely in a position to save the gold standard through tightmoney when the British government, at the end of July, pro-jected a massive fiscal 1932–33 deficit of £120 million, thelargest since 1920.

It was the lastday of the age of economic liberalism in which GreatBritain had been the leader of the world. . . . Now thewhole edifice had crashed. The slogan “safe as the Bank ofEngland” no longer had any meaning. The Bank of Eng-land had gone into default. For the first time in history agreat creditor country had devalued its currency, and byso doing had inflicted heavy losses on all those who hadtrusted it.112As soon as England went off the gold standard, the poundfell by 30 percent. It is ironic that, after all the travail Britainhad put the world through, the pound fell to a level, $3.40, thatmight have been viable if she had originally returned to gold atthat rate.

Accordingly, the early years of the Roosevelt New Dealwere marked by a comprehensive and successful assault on theHouse of Morgan, that is, in the Glass-Steagall Act, outlawingMorgan-type integration of commercial and investment bank-ing. In contrast to the Morgan dominance during the Republi-can era of the 1920s, the early New Deal was dominated by analliance of the Harrimans, Rockefellers, and various retailers,farm groups, the silver bloc, and industries producing for retailsales (for example, automobiles and typewriters), all of whomwere now backing an inflationist and economic nationalist pro-gram. When the British, backed by the Morgans, convened aWorld Economic Conference in London in June 1933, to try torestabilize exchange rates, the plan was scuttled at the lastminute by President Roosevelt, under the influence of the infla-tionist-economic nationalist bloc. The Morgans were taking ashellacking at home and abroad. It was only in 1936, by the good offices of leading Morganbanker Norman Davis, a longtime friend of Roosevelt’s, andof Democrat Morgan partner Russell Leffingwell, that theMorgans would begin to recoup their political losses. Thebeginning of the return of the Morgans was symbolized bythe September 1936 Tripartite Monetary Agreement, partiallystabilizing the exchange rates of the currencies of Britain,France, and the U.S., a collaboration that was soon extendedto Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland. These agreements, inaddition to the dollar’s still remaining on an international(but not domestic) gold bullion standard at $35 an ounce, setthe stage for the Morgan drive organized by Norman Davis,head of Morgan’s Council of Foreign Relations, to bring anew world gold-exchange standard out of the cauldron ofWorld War II.

The prewar monetary order was genuinely “international”;that is, world money rested not on paper tickets issued by oneor more governments but on a genuine economic commodity—gold—whose supply rested on market supply-and-demandprinciples. In short, the international gold standard was themonetary equivalent and corollary of international free trade incommodities. It was a method of separating money from theState just as enterprise and foreign trade had been so separated.In short, the gold standard was the monetary counterpart oflaissez-faire in other economic areas. The gold standard in the prewar era was never “pure,” nomore than was laissez-faire in general. Every major country,except the United States, had central banks which tried theirbest to inflate and manipulate the currency. But the system wassuch that this intervention could only operate within narrowlimits. If one country inflated its currency, the inflation in thatcountry would cause the banks to lose gold to other nations,and consequently the banks, private and central, would beforelong be brought to heel. And while England was the worldfinancial center during this period, its predominance was mar-ket rather than political, so it too had to abide by the monetarydiscipline of the gold standard. As H. Parker Willis described it: Prior to the World War the distribution of the metallicmoney of gold standard countries had been directed andregulated by the central banks of the world in accordancewith the generally known and recognized principles of inter-national distribution of the precious metals. Free movementof these metals and freedom on the part of the individual toacquire and hold them were general.

In the first place, all ofthe major countries financed the massive war effort through anequally massive inflation, which meant that every countryexcept the United States, even including Great Britain, wasforced to go off the gold standard, since they could no longerhope to redeem their currency obligations in gold. The interna-tional order not only was sundered by the war, but also split intonumerous separate, competing, and warring currencies, whoseinflation was no longer subject to the gold restraint. In addition,the various governments engaged in rigorous exchange control,fixing exchange rates and prohibiting outflows of gold; mone-tary warfare paralleled the broader economic and military con-flict. At the end of the war, the major powers sought to reconsti-tute some form of international monetary order out of the chaosand warring economic blocs of the war period. The crucial actorin this drama was Great Britain, which was faced with a seriesof dilemmas and difficulties. On the one hand, Britain not onlyaimed at re-establishing its former eminence, but it meant to useits victorious position and its domination of the League ofNations to work its will upon the other nations, many of themnew and small, of post-Versailles Europe. This meant its mone-tary as well as its general political and economic dominance.Furthermore, it no longer felt itself bound by old-fashioned lais-sez-faire restraints from exerting frankly political control, nordid it any longer feel bound to observe the classical gold-stan-dard restraints against inflation. While Britain’s appetite was large, its major dilemma was itsweakness of resources. The wracking inflation and the with-drawal from the gold standard had left the United States, notGreat Britain, as the only “hard,” gold-standard country. If GreatBritain were to dominate the postwar monetary picture, itwould somehow have to take the United States into camp as itswilling junior partner. From the classic prewar pound-dollar parof $4.86 to the pound, the pound had fallen on the internationalThe New Deal and the439International Monetary System"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"money markets to $3.50, a substantial 30-percent drop, a dropthat reflected the greater degree of inflation in Great Britain thanin the U.S. The British then decided to constitute a new form ofinternational monetary system, the “gold-exchange standard,”which it finally completed in 1925. In the classical, prewar goldstandard, each country kept its reserves in gold, and redeemedits paper and bank currencies in gold coin upon demand. Thenew gold-exchange standard was a clever device to permitBritain and the other European countries to remain inflated andto continue inflating, while enlisting the United States as the ulti-mate support for all currencies. Specifically, Great Britain wouldkeep its reserves, not in gold but in dollars, while the smallercountries of Europe would keep theirreserves, not in gold but inpounds sterling. In this way, Great Britain could pyramidinflated currency and credit on top of dollars, while Britain’sclient states could pyramid theircurrencies, in turn, on top ofpounds. Clearly, this also meant that onlythe United Stateswould remain on a gold-coin standard, the other countries“redeeming” only in foreign exchange. The instability of thissystem, with pseudo gold-standard countries pyramiding ontop of an increasingly shaky dollar-gold base, was to becomeevident in the Great Depression. But the British task was not simply to induce the UnitedStates to be the willing guarantor of all the shaky and inflatedcurrencies of war-torn Europe. For Great Britain might wellhave been able to return to the original form of gold standard ata new, realistic, depreciated parity of $3.50 to the pound. But itwas not willing to do so. For the British dream was to restore,even more glowingly than before, British financial preeminence,and if it depreciated the pound by 30 percent, it would therebyacknowledge that the dollar, not the pound, was the worldfinancial center. This it was fiercely unwilling to do; for restora-tion of dominance, for the saving of financial face, it wouldreturn at the good old $4.86 or bust in the attempt. And bust italmost did. For to insist on returning to gold at $4.86, even onthe new, vitiated, gold-exchange basis, was to mean that thepound would be absurdly expensive in relation to the dollar440A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War II"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"and other currencies, and would therefore mean that at currentinflated price levels, Britain’s exports—its economic lifeline—would be severely crippled, and a general depression wouldensue. And indeed, Britain suffered a severe depression in herexport industries—particularly coal and textiles—throughoutthe 1920s. If she insisted on returning at the overvalued $4.86,there was only one hope for keeping her exports competitive inprice: a massive domestic deflation to lower price and wage lev-els. While a severe deflation is difficult at best, Britain nowfound it impossible, for the new system of national unemploy-ment insurance and the new-found strength of trade unionsmade wage-cutting politically unthinkable. But if Britain would not or could not make her exports com-petitive by returning to gold at a depreciated par or by deflatingat home, there was a third alternative which it could pursue,and which indeed marked the key to the British internationaleconomic policy of the 1920s: it could induce or force othercoun-tries to inflate, or themselves to return to gold at overvaluedpars; in short, if it could not clean up its own economic mess, itcould contrive to impose messes upon everyone else. If it didnot do so, it would see inflating Britain lose gold to the UnitedStates, France, and other “hard-money” countries, as indeedhappened during the 1920s; only by contriving for other coun-tries, especially the U.S., to inflate also, could it check the loss ofgold and therefore halt the collapse of the whole jerry-builtinternational monetary structure. In the short run, the British scheme was brilliantly conceived,and it worked for a time; but the major problem went unheeded:if the United States, the base of the pyramid and the sole link ofall these countries to gold and hard money, were to inflateunduly, the dollar toowould become shaky, it would lose gold athome and abroad, and the dollar would itself eventually col-lapse, dragging the entire structure down with it. And this isessentially what happened in the Great Depression.

The FinancialCommittee of the League of Nations was largely dominatedand run by Britain’s major financial figure, Montagu Norman,head of the Bank of England, working through such close Nor-man associates on the committee as Sir Otto Niemeyer and SirHenry Strakosch, leaders in the concept of close central bank col-laboration to “stabilize” (in practice, to raise) price levels through-out the world. The distinguished British economist Sir RalphHawtrey, director of Financial Studies at the British Treasury, wasone of the first to advocate this system, as well as to call for thegeneral European adoption of a gold-exchange standard. In thespring of 1922, Norman induced the league to call the GenoaConference, which urged similar measures.2But the British scarcely confined their pressure upon Euro-pean countries to resolutions and conferences. Using the carrotof loans from England and the United States and the stick ofpolitical pressure, Britain induced country after country to orderits monetary affairs to suit the British—that is, to return only to agold-exchange standard at overvalued pars that would hampertheir own exports and stimulate imports from Great Britain. Fur-thermore, the British also used their inflated, cheap credit to lendwidely to Europe in order to stimulate their own flagging exportmarket. A trenchant critique of British policy was recorded in thediary of Émile Moreau, governor of the Bank of France, a coun-try that clung to the gold standard and to a hard-money policy,and was thereby instrumental in bringing down the pound andBritish financial domination in 1931.

One was direct lines of credit, which the New York bankextended, in 1925 and after, to Britain, Belgium, Poland, andItaly, to subsidize their going to a gold-exchange standard atovervalued pars. More directly significant was a massive mon-etary inflation and credit expansion which Strong generated inthe United States in 1924 and again in 1927, for the purpose ofpropping up the pound. The idea was that gold flows fromBritain to the United States would be checked and reversed byAmerican credit expansion, which would prop up or raiseprices of American goods, thereby stimulating imports fromGreat Britain, and also lower interest rates in the U.S. as com-pared to Britain. The fall in interest rates would further stimu-late flows of gold from the U.S. to Britain and thereby check theresults of British inflation and overvaluation of the pound. Bothtimes, the inflationary injection worked, and prevented Britainfrom reaping the results of its own inflationary policies, but atthe high price of inflation in the United States, a dangerousstock market and real estate boom, and an eventual depression.At the secret central bank conference of July 1927 in New York,called at the behest of Norman, Strong agreed to this inflation-ary credit expansion over the objections of Germany and"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the445International Monetary SystemFrance, and Strong gaily told the French representative that hewas going to give “a little coup de whiskeyto the stock market.”It was a coupfor which America and the world would paydearly.4The Chicago business and financial community, not havingStrong’s ties with England, protested vigorously against the1927 expansion, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago heldout as long as it could against the expansion of cheap moneyand the lowering of interest rates.

At Norman’s request, Strong and a team of Americaneconomists rushed to England to ward off the plan, testifyingthat a gold drain to India would check inflation in other coun-tries, and instead they successfully backed the Norman policy ofa gold-exchange standard and domestic “economizing” of goldto permit domestic expansion of credit.6The intimate Norman-Strong collaboration for joint infla-tion and the gold-exchange standard was not at all an accidentof personality; it was firmly grounded on the close ties thatboth of them had with the House of Morgan and the Morganinterests. Strong himself was a product of the Morgan nexus;he had been the head of the Morgan-oriented Bankers TrustCompany before becoming governor of the New York Fed,and his closest ties were with Morgan partners Henry P. Davi-son and Dwight Morrow, who induced him to assume his postat the Federal Reserve. J.P.

It is no won-der that in his study of the Federal Reserve System during thepre–New Deal era, Dr. Clark concluded that “the New YorkReserve Bank in collaboration with a private internationalbanking house [J.P. Morgan and Company] determined the pol-icy to be followed by the Federal Reserve System.”8The major theoretical rationale employed by Strong and Nor-man was the idea of governmental collaboration to “stabilize”the price level. The laissez-faire policy of the classical, prewargold standard meant that prices would be allowed to find theirown level in accordance with supply and demand, and withoutinterference by central bank manipulation. In practice, thismeant a secularly falling price level, as the supply of goods roseover time in accordance with the long-run rise in productivity.And in practice, price stabilization really meant price raising:either keeping prices up when they were falling, or “reflating”prices by raising them through inflationary action by the centralbanks. Price stabilization therefore meant the replacement ofthe classical, laissez-faire gold standard by “managed money,”by inflationary credit expansion stimulated by the centralbanks.In England, it was, as we have seen, no accident that the leadin advocating price stabilization was taken by Sir RalphHawtrey and various associates of Montagu Norman, includingSir Josiah Stamp, chairman of Midland Railways and a directorof the Bank of England, and two other prominent directors—SirBasil Blackett and Sir Charles Addis. 8Clark, Central Banking Under the Federal Reserve System, p. 343."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"448A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIIt long has been a myth of American historiography thatbankers and big businessmen are invariably believers in“hard money” as against cheap credit or inflation.

Fisher was particularly critical of theminority of skeptical economists who warned of overexpansionin the stock and real estate markets due to cheap money, andeven after the stock market crash, Fisher continued to insist thatprosperity, particularly in the stock market, was just around thecorner. Fisher’s partiality toward stock market inflation wasperhaps not unrelated to his own personal role as a millionaireinvestor in the stock market, a role in which he was financiallydependent on a cheap-money policy.11In the general enthusiasm for Strong and the new era of mon-etary and stock market inflation, the minority of skeptics was ledby the Chase National Bank, affiliated with the Rockefeller inter-ests, particularly A.

THEFIRSTNEWDEAL: DOLLARNATIONALISMThe international monetary framework of the 1920s col-lapsed in the storm of the Great Depression; or rather, it col-lapsed of its own inner contradictions in a depression which ithad helped to bring about. For one of the most calamitous fea-tures of the depression was the international wave of bankingfailures; and the banks failed from the inflation and overexpan-sion which were the fruits of the managed international gold-exchange standard. Once the jerry-built pyramiding of bankcredit had collapsed, it brought down the banking system ofnation after nation; as inflation led to a piling up of currencyclaims abroad, the cashing in of the claims led to a well-foundedsuspicion of the solvency of other banks, and so the failuresspread and intensified. The failures in the weak currency coun-tries led to the accumulation of strains in other weak currencynations, and, ultimately, on the bases of the shaky pyramid:Britain and the United States. The major banking crisis began with the near bankruptcy in1929 of the Boden-Kredit-Anstalt of Vienna, the major bank inAustria, which had never recovered from its dismemberment atVersailles. Desperate attempts by J.P. Morgan, the House ofRothschild, and later the New York Fed, to shore up the bankonly succeeded in a temporary rescue which committed morefinancial resources to an unsound bank and thereby made itsultimate failure in May 1931 all the more catastrophic.

British inflation and cheap money, and the standardthat had made Britain the base of the world’s money, put enor-mous pressure on the pound sterling, as foreign holders of ster-ling balances became increasingly panicky and called on theBritish to redeem their sterling in either gold or dollars. Theheavy loans by British banks to Germany during the 1920smade the pressure after the German monetary collapse stillmore severe. But Britain couldhave saved the day by using theclassical gold-standard medicine in such crises: by raising bankinterest rates sharply, thereby attracting funds to Britain fromother countries. In such monetary crises, furthermore, suchtemporary tight money and checks to inflation give foreignersconfidence that the pound will be sustained, and they then con-tinue to hold sterling without calling on the country forredemption. In earlier crises, for example, Britain had raised itsbank rate as high as 10 percent early in the proceedings, andtemporarily contracted the money supply to put a stringentcheck to inflation. But by 1931 deflation and hard money hadbecome unthinkable in the British political climate. And soBritain stunned the financial world by keeping its bank ratevery low, never raising it above 4.5 percent, and in fact contin-uing to inflate sterling still further to offset gold losses abroad.As the run on sterling inevitably intensified, Great Britain cyni-cally repudiated its own gold-exchange standard, the verymonetary standard that it had forced and cajoled Europe toadopt, by coolly going off the gold standard in September 1931.Its own international monetary system was sacrificed on thealtar of continued domestic inflation.1312See Anderson, Economics and the Public Welfare, pp. 232 ff. 13See Lionel Robbins,The Great Depression(New York: Macmillan,1934), pp. 89–99.

Currency blocs formed with theBritish Empire forming a sterling bloc, with parities mutuallyfixed in relation to the pound. It is particularly ironic that oneof the earliest effects of Britain’s going off gold was that theovervalued pound, now free to fluctuate, fell to its genuine eco-nomic value, at or below $3.40 to the pound. And so Britain’sgrand experiment in returning to a form of gold at an overval-ued par had ended in disaster, for herself as well as for the restof the world.In the last weeks of the Hoover administration, a desperateattempt was made by the U.S. to restore an international mone-tary system; this time the offer was made to Britain to return tothe gold standard at the current, eminently more sensible par, inexchange for substantial reduction of the British war debt. Nolonger would Britain be forced by overvaluation to be in achronic state of depression of its export industries. But Britainnow had the nationalist bit in its teeth; and it insisted on out-right “reflation” of prices back up to the pre-depression, 1929levels. It had become increasingly clear that the powerful “pricestabilizationists” were interested not so much in stabilization asin high prices, and now they would only be satisfied with aninflationary return to boom prices.

Finally, during the interregnum between theHoover and Roosevelt administrations, the nation’s banksbegan to collapse in earnest. The general bank collapse meantthat the banking system, always unsound and incapable of pay-ing more than a fraction of its liabilities on demand, could onlygo in either of two opposite directions. A truly laissez-faire pol-icy would have allowed the failing banks to collapse, andthereby to engage in a swift, sharp surgical operation thatwould have transformed the nation’s monetary system from anunsound, inflationary one to a truly “hard” and stable currency.The other pole was for the government to declare massive“bank holidays,” that is, to relieve the banks of the obligation topay their debts, and then move on to the repudiation of the goldstandard and its replacement by inflated fiat paper issued by thegovernment. It is important to realize that neither the Hoovernor the Roosevelt administrations had any intention of takingthe first route. While there was a considerable split on whetheror not to stay on the gold standard, no one endorsed the rigor-ous laissez-faire route.15The new Roosevelt administration was now faced with thechoice of retaining or going off the gold standard. While almosteveryone supported the temporary “bank holidays,” there wasa severe split on the longer-run question of the monetary stan-dard.

The Committee for theNation, founded in January 1933, stood squarely for the “refla-tion” of prices back to their pre-1929 levels; stabilization of theprice level was to proceed only afterthat point had beenachieved.

Another group, more con-servative, who stood to gain by devaluation were those whohad already exported gold or otherwise acquired liquiddeposits in foreign banks. They conceived that they weremerely protecting the value of their capital. . . .

The firstcrisis occurred over the French suggestion for a temporary “cur-rency truce”—a de facto stabilization of exchange rates betweenthe franc, dollar, and pound for the duration of the conference.Surely eminently reasonable, the plan was also a clever devicefor an entering wedge toward a hopefully permanent stabiliza-tion of exchange rates on a full gold basis. The British wereamenable, provided that the pound remained fairly cheap inrelation to the dollar, so that their export advantage gained since1931 would not be lost. On June 16, Sprague and Harrison con-cluded an agreement with the British and French for temporary27Ibid, p. 59. 28Robert H. Ferrell, American Diplomacy in the Great Depression (NewYork: W.W.

The American representatives urged Roosevelt to accept theagreement, with Sprague warning that “a failure now would bemost disastrous,” and Warburg declaring that without stabi-lization “it would be practically impossible to assume a leadingrole in attempting [to] bring about a lasting economic peace.”But Roosevelt quickly rejected the agreement on June 17, givingtwo reasons: that the pound must be stabilized at no cheaperthan $4.25, and that he could not accept any restraint on hisfreedom of action to inflate in order to raise domestic prices.Roosevelt ominously concluded that, “it is my personal viewthat far too much importance is being placed on existing andtemporary fluctuations.” And lest the American delegation takehis reasoning as a stimulus to renegotiate the agreement, Roo-sevelt reminded Hull on June 20: “Remember that far too muchinfluence is attached to exchange stability by banker-influencedcabinets.” Upon receiving the presidential veto, the British andFrench were indignant, and George Harrison quit and returnedhome in disgust; but the American delegation went ahead andissued its official statement on temporary currency stabilizationon June 22. It declared temporary stabilization impermissible,“because the American government feels that its efforts to raiseprices are the most important contribution it can make.”29With temporary stabilization scuttled, the conference set-tled down to long-range discussions, the most importantbeing centered in the subcommission on “immediate measuresof financial reconstruction” of the Monetary and FinancialCommission of the conference. The British delegation beganby introducing a draft resolution, (1) emphasizing the impor-tance of “cheap and plentiful credit” in order to raise the29Pasvolsky, Current Monetary Issues, p. 70.

The Dutch, the Czechoslovaks, the Japanese, andthe Swiss criticized the British advocacy of inflation, and theItalian delegate warned that to put one’s faith in immediate measures for augmenting thevolume of money and credit might lead to a speculativeboom followed by an even worse slump. . . . A hasty andunregulated flood [of credit] would lead to destructiveresults. And the French delegate stressed that no genuine recoverycould occur without a sense of economic and financial security:Who would be prepared to lend, with the fear of beingrepaid in depreciated currency always before his eyes? Whowould find the capital for financing vast programs of eco-nomic recovery and abolition of unemployment, as long asthere is a possibility that economic struggles would be trans-ported to the monetary field? . . . In a word, without stablecurrency there can be no lasting confidence; while the hoard-ing of capital continues, there can be no solution.31The American delegation then submitted its own draft pro-posal, which was similar to the British, ignored currency stability,and advocated close cooperation between all governments andcentral banks for “the carrying out of a policy of making creditabundantly and readily available to sound enterprise,” especiallyby open market operations that expanded the money supply.Also government expenditures and deficits should be synchro-nized between the different nations. 30Pasvolsky, Current Monetary Issues, pp. 71–72. 31Ibid., pp. 72–74."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the463International Monetary SystemThe difference of views between the nations on inflation andprices, however, precluded any agreement in this area at theconference. On the gold question, Great Britain submitted a pol-icy declaration and the U.S. a draft resolution which looked for-ward to eventual restoration of the gold standard—but again,nothing was spelled out on exchange rates, or on the crucialquestion of whether restoration of price inflation should comefirst. In both the American and British proposals, however, eventhe eventual gold standard would be considerably more infla-tionary than it had been in the 1920s: for all domestic gold cir-culation, whether coin or bullion, would be abolished, and goldused only as a medium for settling international balances ofpayment; and all gold reserves ratios to currency would be low-ered.32As could have been predicted before the conference, therewere three sets of views on gold and currency stabilization. TheUnited States, backed only by Sweden, favored cheap money inorder to raise domestic prices, with currency stabilization to bedeferred until a sufficient price rise had occurred. Whateverinternational cooperation was envisaged would stress jointinflationary action to raise price levels in some coordinatedmanner. The United States, moreover, went further even thanSweden in calling for reflating wholesale prices back to 1926 lev-els. The gold bloc attacked currency and price inflation, pointedto the early postwar experience of severe inflation and currencydepreciation, and hence insisted on stabilization of exchangesand the avoidance of depreciation. In the confused middle werethe British and the sterling bloc, who wanted price reflation andcheap credit, but also wanted eventual return to the gold stan-dard and temporary stabilization of the key currencies. As the London conference foundered on its severe disagree-ments, the gold-bloc countries began to panic. For on the onehand the dollar was failing in the exchange markets, thus mak-ing American goods and currency more competitive.

In consequence,money began to flow out of these countries during June, andHolland and Switzerland lost more than 10 percent of their goldreserves during that month alone. In consequence, the goldcountries launched a final attempt to draft a compromise reso-lution. The proposed resolution was a surprisingly mild one. Itcommitted the signatory countries to reestablishing the goldstandard and stable exchange rates, but it deliberately empha-sized that the parity and date for each country to return to goldwas strictly up to each individual country. The existing gold-standard countries were pledged to remain on gold, which wasnot difficult since that was their fervent hope. The nongoldcountries were to reaffirm their ultimate objective to return togold, to try their best to limit exchange speculation in the mean-while, and to cooperate with other central banks in these twoendeavors. The innocuousness of the proposed declarationcomes from the fact that it committed the United States to verylittle more than its own resolution of over a week earlier toreturn eventually to the gold standard, coupled with a vagueagreement to cooperate in limiting exchange speculation in themajor currencies. The joint declaration was agreed upon by Sprague and War-burg; by James M. Cox, head of the Monetary Commission ofthe conference; and by Raymond Moley, who had taken chargeof the delegation as a freewheeling White House adviser. Moleywas assistant secretary of state and had been a monetary nation-alist. Moley, however, sent the declaration to Roosevelt on June30, urging the president to accept it, especially since Roosevelthad been willing a few weeks earlier to stabilize at a $4.25 poundwhile the depreciation of the dollar during June had nowbrought the market rate up to $4.40.

Douglas alsostrongly endorsed the London declaration."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the465International Monetary SystemNot hearing immediately from the president, Moley franti-cally wired Roosevelt the next morning that “success even con-tinuance of the conference depends upon United States agree-ment.”33 Roosevelt cabled his rejection on July 1, declaring that“a sufficient interval should be allowed the United States to per-mit . . . a demonstration of the value of price lifting effortswhich we have well in hand.” Roosevelt’s rejection of theinnocuous agreement was in itself startling enough; but he feltthat he had to add insult to injury, to slash away at the Londonconference so that no danger might exist of currency stabiliza-tion or of the reconstruction of an international monetary order.Hence he sent on July 3 an arrogant and contemptuous publicmessage to the London conference, the famous “bombshell”message, so named for its impact on the conference. Roosevelt began by lambasting the idea of temporary cur-rency stabilization, which he termed a “specious fallacy,” an“artificial and temporary . . . diversion.” Instead, Rooseveltdeclared that the emphasis must be placed on “the sound inter-nal economic system of a nation.” In particular, old fetishes of so-called international bankers are beingreplaced by efforts to plan national currencies with theobjective of giving to those currencies a continuing purchas-ing power which . . . a generation hence will have the samepurchasing and debt-paying power as the dollar value wehope to attain in the near future. That objective means moreto the good of other nations than a fixed ratio for a month ortwo in terms of the pound or franc. In short, the president was now totally committed to the nation-alist Fisher–Committee for the Nation program for papermoney, currency inflation and very steep reflation of prices, andthen stabilization of the higher internal price level.

From here on in the 1930s, monetarynationalism, currency blocs, and commercial and financialwarfare would be the order of the day. The French were bitter and the English stricken at the Roo-sevelt message. The chagrined James P. Warburg promptlyresigned as financial adviser to the delegation, and this was tobe the beginning of the exit of this highly placed economicadviser from the Roosevelt administration. A similar fate was instore for Oliver Sprague and Dean Acheson.

Playing an ambivalent rolein the entire affair, Bernard Baruch, who was privately in favorof the old gold standard, praised Roosevelt fulsomely for hismessage. “Until each nation puts its house in order by the sameHerculean efforts that you are performing,” Baruch wrote thepresident, “there can be no common denominators by which wecan endeavor to solve the problems. . . . There seems to be onecommon ground that all nations can take, and that is the oneoutlined by you.”35Expressions of enthusiastic support for the president’s deci-sion came, as might be expected, from Irving Fisher andGeorge F. Warren, who urged Roosevelt to avoid any possibleagreement that might limit “our freedom to change the dollar34The full text of Roosevelt’s message can be found in Pasvolsky,Current Monetary Issues, pp. 83–84, or Ferrell, American Diplomacy, pp.270–72. 35Schlesinger, Coming of the New Deal, p. 224.

Farley has recorded in his memoirs thatRoosevelt was prompted to send his angry message by comingto suspect a plot to influence Moley in favor of stabilization byThomas W. Lamont, partner of J.P. Morgan and Company,working through Moley’s conference aide and White Houseadviser, Herbert Bayard Swope, who was close to the Morgansand also a longtime confidant of Baruch. This might wellaccount for Roosevelt’s bitter reference to the “so-called inter-national bankers.” The situation is curious, however, sinceSwope was firmly on the antistabilizationist side, and Roo-sevelt’s London message was greeted enthusiastically by Rus-sell Leffingwell of Morgans, who apparently took little noticeof its attack on international bankers. Leffingwell wrote to thepresident: “You were very right not to enter into any tempo-rary or permanent arrangements to peg the dollar in relation tosterling or any other currency.”36From the date of the torpedoing of the London EconomicConference, monetary nationalism prevailed for the remain-der of the 1930s. The United States finally fixed the dollar at$35 an ounce in January 1934, amounting to a two-thirdsincrease in the gold price of the dollar from its original moor-ings less than a year before, and to a 40-percent devaluation ofthe dollar. The gold nations continued on gold for two moreyears, but the greatly devalued dollar now began to attract aflood of gold from the gold countries, and France was finallyforced off gold in the fall of 1936, with the other major goldcountries—Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland—followingshortly thereafter. While the dollar was technically fixed interms of gold, there was no further gold coin or bullionredemption within the U.S. Gold was used only as a methodof clearing balances of payments, with only fitful redemptionto foreign countries. 36Schlesinger, Coming of the New Deal, p. 224; Ferrell, AmericanDiplomacy in the Great Depression, pp. 273ff."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"468A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIThe only significant act of international collaboration after1934 came in the fall of 1936, at about the time France wasforced to leave the gold standard. Partly to assist the French,the United States, Great Britain, and France entered into a Tri-partite Agreement with France, beginning on September 25,1936. The French agreed to throw in the exchange-rate sponge,and devalued the franc by between one-fourth and one-third.At this new par, the three governments agreed—notto stabilizetheir currencies—but to iron out day-to-day fluctuations inthem, to engage in mutual stabilization of each other’s curren-cies only within each 24-hour period. This was scarcely stabi-lization, but it did constitute a moderating of fluctuations, aswell as politico-monetary collaboration, which began with thethree Western countries and soon expanded to include theother former gold nations: Belgium, Holland, and Switzer-land. This collaboration continued until the outbreak of WorldWar II.37At least one incident marred the harmony of the TripartiteAgreement. In the fall of 1938, while the United States andBritain were hammering out a trade agreement, the Britishbegan pushing the pound below $4.80. At the threat of thischeapening of the pound, U.S. Treasury officials warned Secre-tary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that if “sterlingdrops substantially below $4.80, our foreign and domesticbusiness will be adversely affected.” In consequence, Morgen-thau successfully insisted that the trade agreement with Britainmust include a clause that the agreement would terminate ifBritain should allow the pound to fall below $4.80.3837On the Tripartite Agreement, see Raymond F.

German economic nationalism in the 1930s was, first of all,conditioned by the horrifying experience that Germany hadhad with runaway inflation and currency depreciation duringthe early 1920s, culminating in the monetary collapse of 1923.Though caught with an overvalued par as each Europeancountry went off the gold standard, no German governmentcould have politically succeeded in engaging once again in thedreaded act of devaluation. No longer on gold, and unable todevalue the mark, Germany was obliged to engage in strictexchange control. In this economic climate, Dr. Schacht wasparticularly successful in making bilateral trade agreementswith individual countries, agreements which amounted to39For revisionist emphasis on this economic basis for the Americandrive toward war with Germany, see ibid., pp. 98–108; Lloyd C.

In the anti-German propaganda of the 1930s, the Germanbarter deals were agreements in which Germany somehowinvariably emerged as coercive victor and exploiter of the othercountry involved, even though they were mutually agreed uponand therefore presumably mutually beneficial exchanges.40 Actu-ally, there was nothing either diabolic or unilaterally exploitiveabout the barter deals. Part of the essence of the barter arrange-ments has been neglected by historians—the deliberate over-valuation of the exchange rates of bothcurrencies involved inthe deals. The German mark, as we have seen, was deliberatelyovervalued as the alternative to the spectre of currency depreci-ation; the situation of the other currencies was a bit more com-plex. Thus, in the barter agreements between Germany and thevarious Balkan countries (especially Rumania, Hungary, Bul-garia, and Yugoslavia), in which the Balkans exchanged agri-cultural products for German-manufactured goods, the Balkancurrencies were also fixed at an artificially overvalued rate vis-à-vis gold and the currencies of Britain and the other Westerncountries. This meant that Germany agreed to pay higher thanworld market rates for Balkan agricultural products while thelatter paid higher rates for German-manufactured products. For the Balkan countries, the point of all this was to forceBalkan consumers of manufactured goods to subsidize theirown peasants and agriculturists. The external consequencewas that Germany was able to freeze out Britain and otherWestern countries from buying Balkan food and raw materials;and since the British could not compete in paying for Balkan40Thus, see Douglas Miller, You Can’t Do Business With Hitler (Boston,1941), esp. pp. 73–77; and Michael A.

Thus, Britain and the West weredeprived of raw materials and markets for their manufacturesby the astute policies of Hjalmar Schacht and the mutuallyagreeable barter agreements between Germany and the Balkanand other, including Latin American, countries.41May notWestern anger at successful German competition through bilat-eral agreements and Western desire to liquidate such competi-tion have been important factors in the Western drive for waragainst Germany?Lloyd Gardner has demonstrated the early hostility of theUnited States toward German economic controls and barterarrangements, its attempts to pressure Germany to shift to amultilateral, “Open-Door” system for American products, andthe repeated American rebuffs to German proposals for bilat-eral exchanges between the two countries. As early as June 26,1933, the influential American consul-general at Berlin, GeorgeMessersmith, was warning that such continued policies wouldmake “Germany a danger to world peace for years to come.”42In pursuing this aggressive policy, President Roosevelt over-rode Agricultural Adjustment Administration chief GeorgePeek, who favored accepting bilateral deals with Germanyand, perhaps not coincidentally, was to be an ardent “isola-tionist” in the late 1930s. Instead, Roosevelt followed the pol-icy of the leading interventionist and spokesman for an “OpenDoor” to American products, Secretary of State Cordell Hull,as well as his assistant secretary, Francis B. Sayre, son-in-law ofWoodrow Wilson.

By late 1938, J. Pierrepont Moffat,head of the Western European Division of the State Depart-ment, was complaining that German control of Central andEastern Europe would mean “a still further extension of thearea under a closed economy.” And, more specifically, in May1940, Assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long warnedthat a German-dominated Europe would mean that “everycommercial order will be routed to Berlin and filled under itsorders somewhere in Europe rather than in the United States.”43And shortly before American entry into the war, John J. McCloy,later to be U.S. high commissioner of occupied Germany, was towrite in a draft for a speech by Secretary of War Henry Stim-son: With German control of the buyers of Europe and her prac-tice of governmental control of all trade, it would be wellwithin her power as well as the pattern she has thus far dis-played, to shut off our trade with Europe, with South Amer-ica and with the Far East.44Not only were Hull and the United States ardent in pressingan anti-German policy against its bilateral trade system, butsometimes Secretary Hull had to whip even Britain into line.Thus, in early 1936, Cordell Hull warned the British ambassa-dor that the “clearing arrangements reached by Britain withArgentina, Germany, Italy and other countries were handicap-ping the efforts of this Government to carry forward its broadprogram with the favored-nation policy underlying it.” Thetendency of these British arrangements was to “drive straighttoward bilateral trading,” and they were therefore milestoneson the road to war.4543Smith, “American Foreign Relations, 1920–1942,” p. 247; LloydGardner, New Deal Diplomacy, p. 99. 44Lloyd Gardner, “New Deal, New Frontiers,” p. 118. 45Tansill, Back Door to War, p. 441."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the473International Monetary SystemOne of the United States government’s biggest economicworries was the growing competition of Germany and its bilat-eral trade in Latin America. As early as 1935, Cordell Hull hadconcluded that Germany was “straining every tendon toundermine United States trading relations with Latin Amer-ica.”46A great deal of political pressure was used to combatGerman competition. Thus, in the mid-1930s, the AmericanChamber of Commerce in Brazil repeatedly pressed the StateDepartment to scuttle the Germany-Brazil barter deal, whichthe chamber termed the “greatest single obstacle to free tradein South America.” Brazil was finally induced to cancel itsagreement with Germany in exchange for a $60 million loanfrom the U.S. America’s exporters, grouped in the NationalForeign Trade Council, issued resolutions against Germantrade methods, and pressured the government for strongeraction. And in late 1938 President Roosevelt asked ProfessorJames Harvey Rogers, an economist and disciple of IrvingFisher, to make a currency study of all of South America inorder to minimize “German and Italian influence on this sideof the Atlantic.” It is no wonder that German diplomats in Brazil, Chile, andUruguay reported home that the United States was “exertingvery strong pressure against Germany commercially,” whichincluded economic, commercial, and political oppositiondesigned to drive Germany out of the Brazilian and other SouthAmerican markets.47In the spring of 1935, the German ambassador to Washing-ton, desperately anxious to bring an end to American politicaland economic warfare, asked the United States what Germanycould do to end American hostilities. The American answer,which amounted to a demand for unconditional economicsurrender, was that Germany abandon its economic policy in46Smith, “American Foreign Relations, 1920–1942,” p. 247. 47Lloyd Gardner, New Deal Diplomacy, pp. 59–60."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"474A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIfavor of America. The American reply “really meant,” notedPierrepont Moffat, “a fundamental acceptance by Germany ofour trade philosophy, and a thoroughgoing partnership withus along the road of equality of treatment and the reduction oftrade barriers.” The United States further indicated that it wasinterested that Germany accept, not so much the principleofthe most-favored national clause in all international trade, butspecifically for Americanexports.48When war broke out in September 1939, Bernard Baruch’sreaction was to tell President Roosevelt that “if we keep ourprices down there is no reason why we shouldn’t get the cus-tomers of the belligerent nations that they have had to dropbecause of the war. And in that event,” Baruch exulted, “Ger-many’s barter system will be destroyed.”49But particularlysignificant is the retrospective comment made by SecretaryHull: [W]ar did not break out between the United States and anycountry with which we had been able to negotiate a tradeagreement. It is also a fact that, with very few exceptions, thecountries with which we signed trade agreements joinedtogether in resisting the Axis.

It might be noted that in the spring of 1936, SecretaryHull refused to settle for a bilateral deal to sell Germany a large store ofAmerican cotton; Hull denounced the idea as “blackmail.” The pre-dictable result was that in the next couple of years the sources of raw cot-ton imported into Germany shifted sharply from the United States toBrazil and Egypt, which had been willing to make barter sales of cotton.Ibid., p. 104; Arthur Schweitzer, Big Business in the Third Reich (Bloomington:Indiana University Press, 1964), p. 316. 49Francis Neilson, The Tragedy of Europe(Appleton, Wis.: C.C.

A corollary aim was to replace economicnationalism and bilateralism by the Hullian kind of multilateraltrading and “Open Door” for American goods. But the mostinsistent drive, and the particularly successful one, was toreconstruct an international monetary system. The system inview was to resemble the gold-exchange system of the 1920squite closely. Once again, all the major world’s currencies wereto abandon fluctuating and nationally determined exchangerates on behalf of fixed parities with other currencies and of allof them with gold. Once again, there was to be no full-fledgedor internal gold standard for any of these nations, while in the-ory all currencies were to be fixed in terms of one key currency,which would form a gold-exchange standard on which othernations could pyramid their own supply of domestic money.But there were two crucial differences from the 1920s. One wasthat while the key currency was to be the only currencyredeemable in gold, there was to be no further embarrassingpossibility of internal redemption in gold; gold was only to be amethod of international payment between central banks, andnever again an actual money held by the public. In this way, thekey currency—and the rest of the world in response—couldexpand and inflate much further than in the 1920s, freed as theywere from the check of domestic redemption. But the seconddifference was more politically far-reaching: for instead of twojoint-partner key currencies, the pound and the dollar, with thedollar as workhorse junior subaltern, the onlykey currency nowwas to be the dollar, which was to be fixed at $35 to the goldounce.

As Secretary of the TreasuryHenry Morgenthau, Jr., was later to express it, the critical andeminently successful objective was “to move the financial cen-ter of the world” from London to the United States Treasury.53And all this eminently was in keeping with the prophetic visionof Cordell Hull, the man who, in the words of Gabriel Kolko,had “the basic responsibility for American political and eco-nomic planning for the peace.” For Hull had urged upon Con-gress as far back as 1932 that America “gird itself, yield to thelaw of manifest destiny, and go forward as the supreme worldfactor economically and morally.”54 World War II was the occasion for a new coalition to formbehind the New Deal, a coalition which reintegrated many con-servative “internationalist” financial interests who had beenthrown into opposition by the domestic statism or economicnationalism of the earlier New Deal. This reintegration of theentire conservative financial community was particularly truein the field of international economic and monetary policy.Here, Dr. Leo Pasvolsky, a conservative economist who had bro-ken with the New Deal upon the scuttling of the London Eco-nomic Conference, returned to a crucial role as Secretary Hull’sspecial adviser on postwar planning.

Clayton’s major focus in postwarplanning was to promote and encourage American exports—with cotton, not unnaturally, never out of the forefront of hisconcerns.55Even before American entry into the war, U.S. economic waraims were well-defined and rather brutally simple: they hingedon a determined assault upon the 1930s system of economic andmonetary nationalism, so as to promote American exports,investments, and financial dealings overseas—in short, the“Open Door” for American commerce. In the sphere of com-mercial policy, this took the form of pressure for reduction oftariffs on American products, and the elimination of quantita-tive import restrictions on those products. In the allied sphere ofmonetary policy, it meant the breakup of powerful nationalisticcurrency blocs, and the restoration of an international monetaryorder based on the dollar in which currencies would be con-vertible into each other at predictable and fixed parities andthere would be a minimum of national exchange controls overthe purchase and use of foreign currencies. And even as the United States prepared to enter the war tosave its ally, Great Britain, it was preparing to bludgeon theBritish at a time of great peril to abandon their sterling bloc,which they had organized effectively after the Ottawa Agree-ments of 1932.

The agreement was signed at the end of February1942, and in return the State Department pledged to the Britishthat the U.S. would pursue a policy of economic expansion andfull employment after the war. Even under these conditions,however, Britain soon maintained that the Lend-Lease Agree-ment committed it to virtually nothing. To Cordell Hull, how-ever, the agreement on Article VII was decisive and constituted“a long step toward the fulfillment, after the war, of the eco-nomic principles for which I had been fighting for half a cen-tury.” The United States also insisted that other nations receiv-ing Lend-Lease sign a virtually identical commitment tomultilateralism after the war. In his first major public address innearly a year, Hull, in July 1942, could now look forward confi-dently that leadership toward a new system of international relation-ships in trade and other economic affairs will devolve verylargely upon the United States because of our great eco-nomic strength. We should assume this leadership, and theresponsibility that goes with it, primarily for reasons of purenational self-interest.59In the postwar planning for economic affairs, the StateDepartment was in charge of commercial and trade policies,while the Treasury conducted the planning in the areas ofmoney and finance. In charge of postwar international financialplanning for the Treasury was the economist Harry DexterWhite. In early 1942, White presented his first plan, which wasto be one of the two major foundations of the postwar monetarysystem. White’s proposal was of course within the frameworkof American postwar economic objectives. The countries of theworld were to join a Stabilization Fund, totaling $5 billion,which would lend funds at short term to deficit countries to59Ibid., pp. 249–51."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the481International Monetary Systemiron out temporary balance-of-payments difficulties. But inreturn for this provision of greater liquidity and short-term aidto deficit countries, exchange rates of currencies were to befixed, in relation to the dollar and hence to gold, with the goldprice to be set at $35 an ounce, and exchange controls were to beabandoned by the various nations. While the White Plan envisioned a substantial amount ofinflation to provide greater currency liquidity, the Britishresponded with a Keynes Plan that was far more inflationary.By this time, Lord Keynes had abandoned economic and mon-etary nationalism for Britain under severe American pressure,and his aim was to salvage as much domestic inflation andcheap money for Britain as he could possibly induce America toaccept. The Keynes Plan envisioned an International ClearingUnion (ICU), which, in return for agreeing to stable exchangerates between currencies and the abandonment of exchangecontrol, provided a huge loan fund to its members of $26 bil-lion. The Keynes Plan, moreover, provided for a new interna-tional monetary unit, the “bancor,” which could be issued bythe ICU in such large amounts as to provide almost uncheckedroom for inflation, even in a country with a large deficit in itsbalance of payments. The nations would consult with eachother about correcting balance-of-payments disequilibria,through altering their exchange rates. The Keynes Plan, fur-thermore, provided automatic access to the fund of liquidity,with none of the embarrassing requirements, as included in theWhite Plan, for deficit countries to cease creating deficits byinflating their currency. Whereas the White Plan authorized theStabilization Fund to require deficit countries to cease inflatingin return for fund loans, the Keynes Plan envisioned that infla-tion would proceed unchecked, with all the burden of necessaryadjustments to be placed on the hard-money, creditor countries,who would be expected to inflate faster themselves, in order notto gain currency from the deficit nations.

Boothby,"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"482A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IILord Beaverbrook, theTimes of London,and the Economist. TheKeynes Plan was attacked by conservatives in the United States,as was even the White Plan for interfering with market forces,and for automatic extension of credit to deficit countries. Criticalof the White Plan were the Guaranty Survey of the GuarantyTrust Company and the American Bankers Association; further-more, the New York Timesand New York Herald Tribune called forreturn to the classical gold standard, and attacked the large meas-ure of governmental financial planning envisioned by both theKeynes and White proposals.60After negotiating during 1943 and into the spring of 1944, theUnited States and Britain hammered out a compromise of theWhite and Keynes plans in April 1944. The compromise wasadopted by a world economic conference in July at BrettonWoods, New Hampshire; it was Bretton Woods that was to pro-vide the monetary framework for the postwar world.61The compromise established an International MonetaryFund (IMF) as the stabilization mechanism; its total funds werefixed at $8.8 billion, far closer to the White than to the Keynesprescriptions. Its balance of IMF international control as againstdomestic autonomy lay between the White and Keynes plans,leaving the whole problem highly fuzzy. On the one hand,national access to the fund was notto be automatic; but on theother, the fund could no longer require corrective domestic eco-nomic policies of its members. On the question of exchangerates, the Americans yielded to the British insistence on allow-ing room for domestic inflation even at the expense of stableexchange rates. The compromise provided that each countrycould be free to make a 10-percent change in its exchange rate,60Richard Gardner, Sterling-Dollar Diplomacy, pp. 71ff., 95–99. 61We do not deal here with the other institution established at BrettonWoods—the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development—which, in contrast to the International Monetary Fund, comes under com-mercial and financial, rather than monetary, policy."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the483International Monetary Systemand that larger changes could be made to correct “fundamentaldisequilibria”; in short, that a chronically deficit country coulddevalue its currency rather than check its own inflation. Fur-thermore, the U.S. yielded again in allowing creditor countriesto suffer by permitting deficit countries to impose exchangecontrols on “scarce currencies.” This meant in effect that themajor European countries, whose currencies would be fixed atexisting highly overvalued rates in relation to the dollar, wouldthus be permitted to enter the IMF with chronically overvaluedcurrencies and then impose exchange controls on “scarce,”undervalued dollars. But despite these extensive concessions,there was no “bancor”; the dollar, fixed at $35 per gold ouncewas now to be firmly established as the key currency base of anew world monetary order. Besides, for the dollar to be under-valued and other major currencies to be overvalued greatlyspurs American exports, which was one of the basic aims of theentire operation. U.S. Ambassador to Britain John G. Winantrecorded the perceptive hostility to the Bretton Woods Agree-ment by the majority of the directors of the Bank of England; forthese men saw “that if the plan is adopted financial control willleave London and sterling exchange will be replaced by dollarexchange.”62The proposed International Monetary Fund ran into a stormof conservative opposition in the United States, from the oppo-site pole of the hostility of the British nationalists. The Americanattack on the IMF was essentially launched by two majorgroups: conservative Eastern bankers and Midwestern isola-tionists. Among the bankers, the American Bankers Association(ABA) attacked the unsound and inflationary policy of allow-ing debtor countries to control access to international funds;and W. Randolph Burgess, president of the ABA, denouncedthe provision for debtor rationing of “scarce currencies” as an“abomination.” TheNew York Timesurged rejection of the IMF,62John G.

Another bankers’ group came up with a “key cur-rency” proposal as a substitute for Bretton Woods. This key cur-rency plan was proposed by economist John H. Williams, vicepresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and wasendorsed by Leon Fraser, president of the First National Bank ofNew York, and by Winthrop W. Aldrich, head of the ChaseNational Bank. It envisioned a bilateral pound-dollar stabiliza-tion, fueled by a large transitional American loan, or even grant,to Great Britain. Thus, the key-currency people were ready toabandon temporarily not only the classical gold standard buteven an international monetary order, and to stay temporarilyin a modified version of the world of the 1930s.63The Midwestern isolationist critics of the IMF were led bySenator Robert A. Taft (R-Ohio), who charged that, while thebulk of the valuable hard money placed in the fund would beAmerican dollars, the dollars would be subject to internationalcontrol by the fund authorities, and therefore by the debtorcountries. The debtor countries could then still continueexchange controls and sterling bloc practices. Here Taft failed torealize that formal and informal structures in the Bretton Woodsdesign would ensure effective United States control of both theIMF and the International Bank.6463An elaboration of the banker-oriented criticisms of the InternationalMonetary Fund may be found in Anderson, Economics and the PublicWelfare, pp. 578–89. 64Henry W.

It empha-sized that the U.S. government would have effective control, atleast of its own representatives in the fund. It played up—inwhat proved to be gross exaggeration—the favorable aspects ofthe various ambiguous provisions: insisting that debtor accessto the fund would not be automatic, that exchange controlswould be removed, and that exchange rates would be stabi-lized. It pushed heavily the vague idea that the fund was cru-cial to postwar international cooperation to keep the peace.Particularly interesting was the argument of Will Clayton andothers that Bretton Woods would facilitate the general commer-cial policy of eliminating trade discrimination and barriersagainst American exports. This argument was put particularlybaldly by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau in a speech to Detroitindustrialists. Morgenthau promised that the Bretton Woodsagreement would lead to a world trade freed from exchangecontrols and depreciated currencies, and that this would greatlyincrease the exports of American automobiles. Since the fundwould begin operations the following year by accepting theexisting grossly overvalued currency parities that most of thenations insisted upon, this meant that Morgenthau might haveknown whereof he spoke. For if other currencies are overvaluedand the dollar undervalued, American exports are indeedencouraged and subsidized.65It is perhaps understandable, then, that not only the majorfarm, labor, and New Deal liberal organizations pushed for Bret-ton Woods, but that the large majority of industrial and financialinterests also approved the agreement and urged its passage inCongress.

Looking forwardperceptively to the postwar world in January 1945, Lamar Flem-ing, Jr., president of Anderson, Clayton and Company, wrote tohis longtime colleague Will Clayton that the “British empire andBritish international influence is a myth already.” The UnitedStates would soon become the British protector against theemerging Russian land mass, prophesied Fleming, and thiswould mean “the absorption into [the] American empire of theparts of the British Empire which we will be willing to accept.”67As the New Deal came to a close, the triumphant United Statesstood ready to reap its fruits on a worldwide scale. EPILOGUEThe Bretton Woods agreement established the framework forthe international monetary system down to the early 1970s. Anew and more restricted international dollar-gold exchangestandard had replaced the collapsed dollar-pound–gold-exchange standard of the 1920s. During the early postwar years,the system worked quite successfully within its own terms, andthe American banking community completely abandoned itsopposition.68 With European currencies inflated and overvalued,and European economies exhausted, the undervalued dollar66On the American debate over Bretton Woods, see Richard Gardner,Sterling-Dollar Diplomacy, pp. 129–43; on Bretton Woods, see alsoMikesell, United States Economic Policy, pp. 129–35, 138ff., 142ff., 149–52,155-58, 163–70. 67Kolko, Politics of War, p. 294. 68The removal of such classical pro-gold-standard economists asHenry Hazlitt from his post as editorial writer for the New York TimesandDr. Benjamin M.

But in the early1950s, the world economic balance began slowly but emphati-cally to change. For while the United States, influenced by Key-nesian economics, proceeded blithely to inflate the dollar, seem-ingly relieved of the limits imposed by the classical goldstandard, several European countries began to move in theopposite direction. Under the revived influence of conservative,free-market, and hard-money-oriented economists in such coun-tries as West Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland, thesenewly recovered countries began to achieve prosperity with farless inflated currencies. Hence these currencies became everstronger and “harder” while the dollar became softer andincreasingly inflated.69The continuing inflation of the dollar began to have twoimportant consequences: (1) the dollar was increasingly over-valued in relation to gold; and (2) the dollar was also increas-ingly overvalued in relation to the West German mark, theFrench and Swiss francs, the Japanese yen, and other hard-money currencies. The result was a chronic and continuingdeficit in the American balance of payments, beginning in theearly 1950s and persisting ever since. The consequence of thechronic deficit was a continuing outflow of gold abroad and aheavy piling up of dollar claims in the central banks of thehard-money countries. Since 1960 the foreign short-term claimsto American gold have therefore become increasingly greaterthan the U.S. gold supply. In short, just as inflation in Englandand the United States during the 1920s led finally to the break-down of the international monetary order, so has inflation in69We might mention the influence of such economists as LudwigErhard, Alfred Müller-Armack, and Wilhelm Röpke in Germany; PresidentLuigi Einaudi in Italy; and Jacques Rueff in France, who had played a sim-ilar hard-money role in the 1920s and early 1930s."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"488A History of Money and Banking in the United States:The Colonial Era to World War IIthe postwar key country, the United States, led to increasingstrains and fissures in the triumphant dollar-order of thepost–World War II world. It has become increasingly evidentthat an ever more inflated and overvalued dollar cannot con-tinue as the permanently secure base of the world monetarysystem, and therefore that this ever more strained and insecuresystem cannot long continue in anything like its present form. In fact, the postwar system has already been changed con-siderably, in an ultimately futile attempt to preserve its basicfeatures. In the spring of 1968, a severe monetary run on thedollar by Europeans redeeming dollar claims led to two majorchanges. One was the partial abandonment of the fixed $35-per-ounce gold price. Instead, a two-price, or “two-tier,” gold pricesystem was established. The dollar and gold were allowed tofind their own level in the free gold markets of the world, withthe United States no longer standing ready to support the dol-lar in the gold market at $35 an ounce. On the other hand, $35still continued as the supposedly eternally fixed price for theworld central banks, who were pledged not to sell gold in theworld market. Keynesian economists were convinced that withthe dollar and gold severed on the world market, the price ofgold would then fall in the freely fluctuating market. Thereverse, however, has occurred, since the world market contin-ued to have more faith in the soundness and the relative hard-ness of gold than in the increasingly inflated dollar.The second change was the creation in 1969 of Special Draw-ing Rights (SDRs), a new form of “paper gold,” of newly cre-ated paper which can supplement gold as an international cur-rency reserve behind each currency. While this indeed put morebacking behind the dollar, the quantity of SDRs has been toolimited to make an appreciable difference to a world economythat trusts the dollar less with each passing year. These two minor repairs, however, failed to change the fun-damental overvaluation of the ever more inflated dollar. In thespring of 1971, a new monetary crisis finally led to a massive re-valuation of the hard currencies. If the United States stubbornly"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"The New Deal and the489International Monetary Systemrefused to lose face by raising the price of gold or by otherwisedevaluing the dollar down to its genuine value in the worldmarket, then the harder currencies, such as West Germany,Switzerland, and the Netherlands, found themselves reluc-tantly forced to raise the value of their currencies. Their alter-natives—a massive calling upon the United States to redeem ingold and thereby the smashing of the façade of dollar redemp-tion in gold—was too much of a political break with the U.S. forthese nations to contemplate. For the United States, to preservethe façade of gold redemption at $35, had been using intensepolitical pressure on its creditors to retain their dollar balancesand notto redeem them in gold. By the late 1960s, GeneralCharles de Gaulle, under the influence of classical gold-stan-dard advocate Jacques Rueff, was apparently preparing to makejust such a challenge—to break the dollar standard as a movetoward restoring the classical gold standard in France andmuch of the rest of Europe. But the French domestic troubles inthe spring of 1968 ended that dream at least temporarily, asFrance was forced to inflate the franc for a time in order to paythe overall wage increase it had agreed upon under the threat ofthe general strike.Despite these hasty repairs, it is becoming increasingly evi-dent that they are makeshift stopgaps, and that a series of moreaggravated crises will shake the international monetary orderuntil a fundamental change is made. A hard-money policy inthe United States that put an end to inflation and increased thesoundness of the dollar might sustain the current system, butthis is so politically remote as to hardly be a likely prognosis.There are several possible monetary systems that mightreplace the present deteriorating order. The new system desiredby the Keynesian economists and by the American governmentwould be a massive extension of “paper gold” to demonetizegold completely and replace it with a new monetary unit (suchas the Keynesian “bancor”) and a paper currency issued by anew world reserve bank. If this were achieved, then the newAmerican-dominated world reserve bank would be able to"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"inflate any currencies indefinitely, and allow inflating curren-cies to pay for any and all deficits ad infinitum. While such ascheme, embodied in the Triffin Plan, the Bernstein Plan, andothers, is now the American dream, it has met determinedopposition by the hard-money countries, and it remains doubt-ful that the United States will be able to force these countries togo along with the plan.The other logical alternative is the Rueff Plan, of returning tothe classical gold standard after a massive increase in the worldprice of gold. But this too is unlikely, especially over powerfulAmerican opposition. Barring acceptance of a new world cur-rency, the Americans would be content to keep inflating andsimply force the hard-money countries to keep appreciatingtheir exchange rates, but again it is doubtful that German,French, Swiss, and other exporters will be content to keep crip-pling themselves in order to subsidize dollar inflation. Perhapsthe most likely prognosis is the formation of a new hard-moneyEuropean currency bloc, which might eventually be strongenough to challenge the dollar, politically as well as economi-cally. In that case, the dollar standard will probably fall apart,and we may see a return to the currency blocs of the 1930s, withthe European bloc this time on a harder and quasi-gold basis.
