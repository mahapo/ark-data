If you love the state, read this book! Students, educated laymen, and academics can all profit from Power and Market . In this vol- ume, Murray N. Rothbard uses positive economics to analyze various schemes and proposals to alter or eliminate market out- comes. Where government supporters come up with numerous reasons why government “needs” to do this or that, Rothbard puts constraints on people’s political fantasies. He shows how the state is not a benign entity that can easily fix problems in the world. Rather, the state is an imperfect and inherently coercive apparatus. Power and Market , now 35 years after its original publication, is still one of the most systematic economic analyses of govern- ment intervention around. Rothbard’s principles treatise Man, Economy, and State describes the economics of market exchange; Power and Market describes the economics of government inter- vention. 1 Rothbard makes it clear that economics is a value free science that provides no ultimate ethical judgments, but he also points out that economics can be used to criticize certain posi- tions: “If an ethical goal can be shown to be self-contradictory and conceptually impossible of fulfillment, then the goal is clearly 1 Rothbard originally wrote this volume as the final third of the 1,500- page manuscript for Man, Economy, and State .

But Rothbard differed from public choice economists such as James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock (and, for that matter, all of his contemporaries) in that he consistently viewed the state as a coercive institution, an institution that was not created to make everyone better off. 3 The central chapters of Power and Market offer a typology and discussion of different types of state intervention. Binary intervention is when the state interferes directly with a private party (e.g., taxes and government spending), and triangular intervention is when the state interferes with the interaction between two third parties (e.g., price controls or product regu- lations). Are people better off when the state takes their money against their will? Are people better off when the state spends their money on something that they would not have purchased on their own? Are private parties better off when they are pre- vented from engaging in exchange that they consider mutually beneficial? Hint: The correct answer is no! Read Chapters 3, 4, and 5 to see Rothbard’s discussion. Throughout the volume, Rothbard describes how govern- ment is not a benign force as many government supporters assume. The government is an institution of coercion that interferes with voluntary relations in the market. Just in case anyone cannot wait to find out how far Rothbard will push the xii Power and Market: Government and the Economy 1970.

Power and Market is noteworthy because it “is the first analysis of the economics of government to argue that no provision of goods or services requires the existence of government.” 4 Before Rothbard, even the most free-market theorists such as Ludwig von Mises, Henry Hazlitt, Ayn Rand, and Friedrich Hayek had simply assumed that services like law enforcement must be provided collectively by the state. Rothbard believes that law enforce- ment must be analyzed in terms of marginal units and, like other goods, those marginal units can be provided privately. He briefly mentions some historical examples of private law enforcement and then speculates how a purely private system could work. Is he being too Utopian? Rothbard responds: [T]his concept is far more workable than the truly Utopian idea of a strictly limited government, an idea that has never worked historically. And understand- ably so, for the State’s built-in monopoly of aggres- sion and inherent absence of free-market checks has enabled it to burst easy any bonds that well-meaning people have tried to place on it. 5 Rothbard’s libertarian anarchism influenced many subsequent thinkers, who have since written numerous articles and books on why government is unnecessary. 6 Preface xiii 4 Murray Rothbard, Power and Market (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1970), p. vi. 5 Rothbard, p. 9. 6 See for example: Randy Barnett, The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998); Bruce Benson, The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State (San Francisco: Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, 1990); idem, To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice (New York: New York University Press, 1998); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Theory of Socialism and Capitalism (Boston: Kluwer, 1989); idem, Democracy—The God That"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In addition to breaking new ground in its time, the book is extremely relevant to political economy today. For example, Power and Market ’s final chapter is a hard-hitting critique of antimarket ethics, which have been retained or are gaining pop- ularity in modern times. Take the view of many modern behav- ioral economists who argue that society should not rely on free markets because people do not always know what is best for them. 7 Rothbard agrees that people often make mistakes, but he disagrees about whether that justifies paternalism. If people do not know what’s best for them, how can they be suited to elect leaders who do? 8 Or take the popular view of many public choice economists who argue in favor of government law enforcement because human nature is imperfect. Rothbard agrees that men are not angels, but that does not justify government for him. 9 If humans are so bad, how can we expect a coercive government xiv Power and Market: Government and the Economy Failed: The Economic and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2001); idem, ed., The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Pro- duction (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 2003); Anthony de Jasay, Against Politics: On Government, Anarchy, and Order (London: Routledge, 1997); Edward Stringham, ed., Anarchy, State, and Public Choice (Cheltenham, U.K.: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2006); and idem, ed., Anarchy and the Law: The Political Economy of Choice (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006). 7 Richard H.

The state, in all of its forms, is injurious to civil society, and if we truly want to improve the world, we must look beyond govern- ment. Real solutions lie not in power but in the market.

See also Benjamin Powell and Christopher Coyne, “Do Pessimistic Assumptions About Human Behavior Justify Government?” Journal of Libertarian Studies 17 (Fall, 2003): 17–38. 11 Rothbard’s coverage of many topics prevents him from delving into any one in too much detail. This breadth of topics is part of the appeal of the book, however. From this perspective, Rothard’s work can be seen as a potential springboard for modern libertarian scholarship on many top- ics. Rothbard wrote, “The discussion throughout the book is largely the- oretical. No attempt has been made to enumerate the institutional exam- ples of government intervention in the world today, an attempt that would, of course, require all too many volumes” ( Power and Market [1970], p. vii). The good news is that Rothbard’s initial pass provides today’s libertarian scholars an opportunity to illustrate or extend the the- oretical ideas in Power and Market . For example, many of my articles on private rule enforcement attempt to do just that: Edward Stringham, “Market Chosen Law,” Journal of Libertarian Studies 14, no. 1 (Winter, 1998–1999): 53–77; idem, “The Emergence of the London Stock Exchange as a Self-Policing Club,” Journal of Private Enterprise 17, no. 2 (2002): 1–19; idem, “The Extralegal Development of Securities Trading in Seventeenth Century Amsterdam,” Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance 43, no. 2 (Summer, 2003): 321–44; Bryan Caplan and Edward Stringham, “Networks, Law, and the Paradox of Cooperation,” Review of Austrian Economics 16, no. 4 (December 2003): 309–26; idem, “Overlap- ping Jurisdictions, Proprietary Communities, and Competition in the Realm of Law,” Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics , forth- coming."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"E CONOMISTS HAVE REFERRED INNUMERABLE TIMES to the “free market,” the social array of voluntary exchanges of goods and services. But despite this abundance of treatment, their analysis has slighted the deeper implications of free exchange. Thus, there has been general neglect of the fact that free exchange means exchange of titles of ownership to property, and that, therefore, the economist is obliged to inquire into the condi- tions and the nature of the property ownership that would obtain in the free society. If a free society means a world in which no one aggresses against the person or property of oth- ers, then this implies a society in which every man has the absolute right of property in his own self and in the previously unowned natural resources that he finds, transforms by his own labor, and then gives to or exchanges with others. 1 A firm prop- erty right in one’s own self and in the resources that one finds, transforms, and gives or exchanges, leads to the property struc- ture that is found in free-market capitalism. Thus, an economist cannot fully analyze the exchange structure of the free market without setting forth the theory of property rights, of justice in property, that would have to obtain in a free-market society. 1 Murray N. Rothbard, Man, Economy, and State (Princeton, N.J.: D. Van Nostrand, 1962; reprints of this edition 1970, 1993, and 2001) and Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market , Scholar’s edition (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2004). 1 1 D EFENSE S ERVICES ON THE F REE M ARKET"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In our analysis of the free market in Man, Economy, and State , we assumed that no invasion of property takes place there, either because everyone voluntarily refrains from such aggres- sion or because whatever method of forcible defense exists on the free market is sufficient to prevent any such aggression. But economists have almost invariably and paradoxically assumed that the market must be kept free by the use of invasive and unfree actions—in short, by governmental institutions outside the market nexus. A supply of defense services on the free market would mean maintaining the axiom of the free society, namely, that there be no use of physical force except in defense against those using force to invade person or property. This would imply the complete absence of a State apparatus or government; for the State, unlike all other persons and institutions in society, acquires its revenue, not by exchanges freely contracted, but by a system of unilateral coercion called “taxation.” Defense in the free society (including such defense services to person and property as police protection and judicial findings) would therefore have to be supplied by people or firms who ( a ) gained their revenue voluntarily rather than by coercion and ( b ) did not—as the State does—arrogate to themselves a compulsory monopoly of police or judicial protec- tion. Only such libertarian provision of defense service would be consonant with a free market and a free society. Thus, defense firms would have to be as freely competitive and as noncoercive against noninvaders as are all other suppliers of goods and serv- ices on the free market. Defense services, like all other services, would be marketable and marketable only. Those economists and others who espouse the philosophy of laissez faire believe that the freedom of the market should be upheld and that property rights must not be invaded. Neverthe- less, they strongly believe that defense service cannot be supplied by the market and that defense against invasion of property must therefore be supplied outside the free market, by the coercive force of the government. In arguing thus, they are caught in an 2 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"insoluble contradiction, for they sanction and advocate massive invasion of property by the very agency (government) that is supposed to defend people against invasion! For a laissez-faire government would necessarily have to seize its revenues by the invasion of property called taxation and would arrogate to itself a compulsory monopoly of defense services over some arbitrar- ily designated territorial area. The laissez-faire theorists (who are here joined by almost all other writers) attempt to redeem their position from this glaring contradiction by asserting that a purely free-market defense service could not exist and that there- fore those who value highly a forcible defense against violence would have to fall back on the State (despite its black historical record as th e great engine of invasive violence) as a necessary evil for the protection of person and property. The laissez-faireists offer several objections to the idea of free-market defense. One objection holds that, since a free mar- ket of exchanges presupposes a system of property rights, there- fore the State is needed to define and allocate the structure of such rights. But we have seen that the principles of a free soci- ety do imply a very definite theory of property rights, namely, self-ownership and the ownership of natural resources found and transformed by one’s labor. Therefore, no State or similar agency contrary to the market is needed to define or allocate property rights. This can and will be done by the use of reason and through market processes themselves; any other allocation or definition would be completely arbitrary and contrary to the principles of the free society. A similar doctrine holds that defense must be supplied by the State because of the unique status of defense as a necessary precondition of market activity, as a function without which a market economy could not exist. Yet this argument is a non sequitur that proves far too much. It was the fallacy of the clas- sical economists to consider goods and services in terms of large classes ; instead, modern economics demonstrates that services must be considered in terms of marginal units . For all actions on Defense Services on the Free Market 3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the market are marginal. If we begin to treat whole classes instead of marginal units, we can discover a great myriad of nec- essary, indispensable goods and services all of which might be considered as “preconditions” of market activity. Is not land room vital, or food for each participant, or clothing, or shelter? Can a market long exist without them? And what of paper, which has become a basic requisite of market activity in the complex modern economy? Must all these goods and services therefore be supplied by the State and the State only? The laissez-faireist also assumes that there must be a single compulsory monopoly of coercion and decision-making in soci- ety, that there must, for example, be one Supreme Court to hand down final and unquestioned decisions. But he fails to rec- ognize that the world has lived quite well throughout its exis- tence without a single, ultimate decision-maker over its whole inhabited surface. The Argentinian, for example, lives in a state of “anarchy,” of nongovernment, in relation to the citizen of Uruguay—or of Ceylon. And yet the private citizens of these and other countries live and trade together without getting into insoluble legal conflicts, despite the absence of a common gov- ernmental ruler. The Argentinian who believes he has been aggressed upon by a Ceylonese, for example, takes his grievance to an Argentinian court, and its decision is recognized by the Ceylonese courts—and vice versa if the Ceylonese is the aggrieved party. Although it is true that the separate nation- States have warred interminably against each other, the private citizens of the various countries, despite widely differing legal systems, have managed to live together in harmony without having a single government over them. If the citizens of north- ern Montana and of Saskatchewan across the border can live and trade together in harmony without a common government, so can the citizens of northern and of southern Montana. In short, the present-day boundaries of nations are purely histori- cal and arbitrary, and there is no more need for a monopoly government over the citizens of one country than there is for one between the citizens of two different nations. 4 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"It is all the more curious, incidentally, that while laissez- faireists should by the logic of their position, be ardent believers in a single, unified world government, so that no one will live in a state of “anarchy” in relation to anyone else, they almost never are. And once one concedes that a single world government is not necessary, then where does one logically stop at the permis- sibility of separate states? If Canada and the United States can be separate nations without being denounced as being in a state of impermissible “anarchy,” why may not the South secede from the United States? New York State from the Union? New York City from the state? Why may not Manhattan secede? Each neighborhood? Each block? Each house? Each person ? But, of course, if each person may secede from government, we have virtually arrived at the purely free society, where defense is sup- plied along with all other services by the free market and where the invasive State has ceased to exist. The role of freely competitive judiciaries has, in fact, been far more important in the history of the West than is often rec- ognized. The law merchant, admiralty law, and much of the common law began to be developed by privately competitive judges, who were sought out by litigants for their expertise in understanding the legal areas involved. 2 The fairs of Cham- pagne and the great marts of international trade in the Middle Ages enjoyed freely competitive courts, and people could patronize those that they deemed most accurate and efficient. Let us, then, examine in a little more detail what a free-mar- ket defense system might look like. It is, we must realize, impos- sible to blueprint the exact institutional conditions of any mar- ket in advance, just as it would have been impossible 50 years ago to predict the exact structure of the television industry today. However, we can postulate some of the workings of a freely competitive, marketable system of police and judicial Defense Services on the Free Market 5 2 See Bruno Leoni, Freedom and the Law (Princeton, N.J.: D.

Most likely, such services would be sold on an advance subscription basis, with premiums paid regularly and services to be supplied on call. Many competitors would undoubtedly arise, each attempting, by earning a reputation for efficiency and pro- bity, to win a consumer market for its services. Of course, it is possible that in some areas a single agency would outcompete all others, but this does not seem likely when we realize that there is no territorial monopoly and that efficient firms would be able to open branches in other geographical areas. It seems likely, also, that supplies of police and judicial service would be pro- vided by insurance companies, because it would be to their direct advantage to reduce the amount of crime as much as possible. One common objection to the feasibility of marketable pro- tection (its desirability is not the problem here) runs as follows: Suppose that Jones subscribes to Defense Agency X and Smith subscribes to Defense Agency Y. (We will assume for conven- ience that the defense agency includes a police force and a court or courts, although in practice these two functions might well be performed by separate firms.) Smith alleges that he has been assaulted, or robbed, by Jones; Jones denies the charge. How, then, is justice to be dispensed? Clearly, Smith will file charges against Jones and institute suit or trial proceedings in the Y court system. Jones is invited to defend himself against the charges, although there can be no sub- poena power, since any sort of force used against a man not yet convicted of a crime is itself an invasive and criminal act that could not be consonant with the free society we have been pos- tulating. If Jones is declared innocent, or if he is declared guilty and consents to the finding, then there if no problem on this level, and the Y courts then institute suitable measures of punish- ment. 3 But what if Jones challenges the finding? In that case, he can either take the case to his X court system, or take it directly 6 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 3 Suppose that Smith, convinced of Jones’ guilt, “takes the law into his own hands” rather than go through the court procedure?

Probably there will be just a few Appeals Court systems, far fewer than the number of primary courts, and each of the lower courts will boast to its customers about being members of those Appeals Court systems noted for their efficiency and probity. The Appeals Court decision can then be taken by the society as binding. Indeed, in the basic legal code of the free society, there probably would be enshrined some such clause as that the decision of any two courts will be considered binding, i.e., will be the point at which the court will be able to take action against the party adjudged guilty. 4 Every legal system needs some sort of socially-agreed-upon cutoff point, a point at which judicial procedure stops and pun- ishment against the convicted criminal begins. But a single monopoly court of ultimate decision-making need not be imposed and of course cannot be in a free society; and a liber- tarian legal code might well have a two-court cutoff point, since there are always two contesting parties, the plaintiff and the defendant. Defense Services on the Free Market 7 itself this would be legitimate and not punishable as a crime, since no court or agency may have the right, in a free society, to use force for defense beyond the selfsame right of each individual. However, Smith would then have to face the consequence of a possible countersuit and trial by Jones, and he himself would have to face punishment as a crimi- nal if Jones is found to be innocent. 4 The Law Code of the purely free society would simply enshrine the libertarian axiom: prohibition of any violence against the person or prop- erty of another (except in defense of someone’s person or property), prop- erty to be defined as self-ownership plus the ownership of resources that one has found, transformed, or bought or received after such transfor- mation. The task of the Code would be to spell out the implications of this axiom (e.g., the libertarian sections of the law merchant or common law would be co-opted, while the statist accretions would be discarded). The Code would then be applied to specific cases by the free-market judges, who would all pledge themselves to follow it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Another common objection to the workability of free-mar- ket defense wonders: May not one or more of the defense agen- cies turn its coercive power to criminal uses? In short, may not a private police agency use its force to aggress against others, or may not a private court collude to make fraudulent decisions and thus aggress against its subscribers and victims? It is very generally assumed that those who postulate a stateless society are also naive enough to believe that, in such a society, all men would be “good,” and no one would wish to aggress against his neighbor. There is no need to assume any such magical or miraculous change in human nature. Of course, some of the pri- vate defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, legalized channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which pro- vides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property. When a State exists, there does exist such a built-in channel, namely, the coercive taxation power, and the compulsory monopoly of forcible protection. In the purely free-market society, a would-be criminal police or judiciary would find it very difficult to take power, since there would be no organized State apparatus to seize and use as the instrumentality of com- mand. To create such an instrumentality de novo is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to establish a functioning State apparatus. Further- more, the purely free-market, stateless society would contain within itself a system of built-in “checks and balances” that would make it almost impossible for such organized crime to succeed. There has been much talk about “checks and balances” in the American system, but these can scarcely be considered checks at all, since every one of these institutions is an agency of the central government and eventually of the ruling party of that government. The checks and balances in the stateless soci- ety consist precisely in the free market , i.e., the existence of freely competitive police and judicial agencies that could quickly be mobilized to put down any outlaw agency. 8 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"It is true that there can be no absolute guarantee that a purely market society would not fall prey to organized crimi- nality. But this concept is far more workable than the truly Utopian idea of a strictly limited government, an idea that has never worked historically. And understandably so, for the State’s built-in monopoly of aggression and inherent absence of free- market checks has enabled it to burst easily any bonds that well- meaning people have tried to place upon it. Finally, the worst that could possibly happen would be for the State to be reestab- lished. And since the State is what we have now , any experimen- tation with a stateless society would have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Many economists object to marketable defense on the grounds that defense is one of an alleged category of “collective goods” that can be supplied only by the State. This fallacious theory is refuted elsewhere. 5 And two of the very few econo- mists who have conceded the possibility of a purely market defense have written: If, then, individuals were willing to pay sufficiently high price, protection, general education, recreation, the army, navy, police departments, schools and parks might be provided through individual initiative, as well as food, clothing and automobiles. 6 Actually, Hunter and Allen greatly underestimated the worka- bility of private action in providing these services, for a com- pulsory monopoly, gaining its revenues out of generalized coer- cion rather than by the voluntary payment of the customers, is bound to be strikingly less efficient than a freely competitive, private enterprise supply of such services.

Whatever problems remain in this area could easily be solved in practice by the market process, that very process which has solved countless organizational problems of far greater intri- cacy. Those laissez-faire economists and writers, past and pres- ent, who have stopped short at the impossibly Utopian ideal of a “limited” government are trapped in a grave inner contradic- tion. This contradiction of laissez faire was lucidly exposed by the British political philosopher, Auberon Herbert: A is to compel B to co-operate with him, or B to com- pel A; but in any case co-operation cannot be secured, as we are told, unless, through all time, one section is compelling another section to form a State. Very good; but then what has become of our system of Individualism?

Types of Intervention W E HAVE SO FAR CONTEMPLATED a free society and a free mar- ket, where any needed defense against violent invasion of per- son and property is supplied, not by the State, but by freely competitive, marketable defense agencies. Our major task in this volume is to analyze the effects of various types of violent intervention in society and, especially, in the market. Most of our examples will deal with the State, since the State is uniquely the agency engaged in regularized violence on a large scale. However, our analysis applies to the extent that any individual or group commits violent invasion. Whether the invasion is “legal” or not does not concern us, since we are engaged in praxeological, not legal, analysis. One of the most lucid analyses of the distinction between State and market was set forth by Franz Oppenheimer. He pointed out that there are fundamentally two ways of satisfying a person’s wants: (1) by production and voluntary exchange with others on the market and (2) by violent expropriation of the wealth of others. 1 The first method Oppenheimer termed “the economic means” for the satisfaction of wants; the second 1 A person may receive gifts, but this is a unitary act of the giver, not involving an act of the receiver himself. 11 2 F UNDAMENTALS OF I NTERVENTION"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"method, “the political means.” The State is trenchantly defined as the “organization of the political means.” 2 A generic term is needed to designate an individual or group that commits invasive violence in society. We may call inter- vener , or invader , one who intervenes violently in free social or market relations. The term applies to any individual or group that initiates violent intervention in the free actions of persons and property owners. What types of intervention can the invader commit? Broadly, we may distinguish three categories. In the first place, the intervener may command an individual subject to do or not to do certain things when these actions directly involve the indi- vidual’s person or property alone . In short, he restricts the sub- ject’s use of his property when exchange is not involved. This may be called an autistic intervention , for any specific command directly involves only the subject himself. Secondly, the inter- vener may enforce a coerced exchange between the individual subject and himself, or a coerced “gift” to himself from the sub- ject. Thirdly, the invader may either compel or prohibit an exchange between a pair of subjects. The former may be called 12 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 2 See Franz Oppenheimer, The State (New York: Vanguard Press, 1914): There are two fundamentally opposed means whereby man, requiring sustenance, is impelled to obtain the nec- essary means for satisfying his desires. These are work and robbery, one’s own labor and the forcible appropriation of the labor of others. . . . I propose . . . to call one’s own labor and the equivalent exchange of one’s own labor for the labor of others “the economic means” for the satisfac- tion of needs, while the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others will be called the “political means. . . . The state is an organization of the political means.

The market, complex though it may be, consists of a series of exchanges between pairs of individuals. However extensive the interventions, then, they may be resolved into unit impacts on either individual subjects or pairs of individual subjects. All these types of intervention, of course, are subdivisions of the hegemonic relation—the relation of command and obedi- ence—as contrasted with the contractual relation of voluntary mutual benefit. Autistic intervention occurs when the invader coerces a sub- ject without receiving any good or service in return. Widely dis- parate types of autistic intervention are: homicide, assault, and compulsory enforcement or prohibition of any salute, speech, or religious observance. Even if the intervener is the State, which issues the edict to all individuals in the society, the edict is still in itself an autistic intervention, since the lines of force, so to speak, radiate from the State to each individual alone. Binary intervention occurs when the invader forces the subject to make an exchange or a unilateral “gift” of some good or service to the invader. Highway robbery and taxes are examples of binary intervention, as are conscription and compulsory jury service. Whether the binary hegemonic relation is a coerced “gift” or a coerced exchange does not really matter a great deal. The only difference is in the type of coercion involved. Slavery, of course, is usually a coerced exchange , since the slaveowner must supply his slaves with subsistence. Curiously enough, writers on political economy have recog- nized only the third category as intervention. 3 It is understandable Fundamentals of Intervention 13 3 This is to be inferred from , rather than discovered in explicit form in, their writings.

Nevertheless, they are part of the subject matter of praxeology—and should be sub- jected to analysis. There is far less excuse for economists to neg- lect the binary category of intervention. Yet many economists who profess to be champions of the “free market” and oppo- nents of interference with it have a peculiarly narrow view of freedom and intervention. Acts of binary intervention, such as conscription and the imposition of income taxes, are not con- sidered intervention at all nor as interferences with the free market. Only instances of triangular intervention, such as price control, are conceded to be intervention. Curious schemata are developed in which the market is considered absolutely “free” and unhampered despite a regular system of imposed taxation. Yet taxes (and conscripts) are paid in money and thus enter the catallactic, as well as the wider praxeological, nexus. 4 In tracing the effects of intervention, one must take care to analyze all its consequences, direct and indirect. It is impossible in the space of this volume to trace all the effects of every one of the almost infinite number of possible varieties of intervention, but sufficient analysis can be made of the important categories of intervention and the consequences of each. Thus, it must be remembered that acts of binary intervention have definite trian- gular repercussions: an income tax will shift the pattern of exchanges between subjects from what it otherwise would have been. Furthermore, all the consequences of an act must be con- sidered; it is not sufficient to engage in a “partial-equilibrium” 14 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 4 A narrow view of “freedom” is characteristic in the present day. In the political lexicon of modern America, “left-wingers” often advocate freedom in the sense of opposition to autistic intervention, but look benignly on triangular intervention. “Right-wingers,” on the other hand, severely oppose triangular intervention, but tend to favor, or remain indifferent to, autistic intervention.

Direct Effects of Intervention on Utility A. I NTERVENTION AND C ONFLICT The first step in analyzing intervention is to contrast the direct effect on the utilities of the participants, with the effect of a free society. When people are free to act, they will always act in a way that they believe will maximize their utility, i.e., will raise them to the highest possible position on their value scale. Their utility ex ante will be maximized, provided we take care to interpret “utility” in an ordinal rather than a cardinal manner. Any action, any exchange that takes place on the free market or more broadly in the free society, occurs because of the expected benefit to each party concerned. If we allow ourselves to use the term “society” to depict the pattern of all individual exchanges, then we may say that the free market “maximizes” social utility, since everyone gains in utility. We must be careful, however, not to hypostatize “society” into a real entity that means something else than an array of all individuals. Coercive intervention, on the other hand, signifies per se that the individual or individuals coerced would not have done what they are now doing were it not for the intervention. The individual who is coerced into saying or not saying something or into making or not making an exchange with the intervener or with someone else is having his actions changed by a threat of violence. The coerced individual loses in utility as a result of the intervention, for his action has been changed by its impact. Any intervention, whether it be autistic, binary, or triangular, causes the subjects to lose in utility. In autistic and binary inter- vention, each individual loses in utility; in triangular interven- tion, at least one, and sometimes both, of the pair of would-be exchangers lose in utility. Fundamentals of Intervention 15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Who, in contrast, gains in utility ex ante ? Clearly, the inter- vener; otherwise he would not have intervened. Either he gains in exchangeable goods at the expense of his subject, as in binary intervention, or, as in autistic and triangular intervention, he gains in a sense of well-being from enforcing regulations upon others. All instances of intervention, then, in contrast to the free market, are cases in which one set of men gains at the expense of other men. In binary intervention, the gains and losses are “tan- gible” in the form of exchangeable goods and services; in other types of intervention, the gains are nonexchangeable satisfac- tions, and the loss consists in being coerced into less satisfying types of activity (if not positively painful ones). Before the development of economic science, people thought of exchange and the market as always benefiting one party at the expense of the other. This was the root of the mer- cantilist view of the market. Economics has shown that this is a fallacy, for on the market both parties to any exchange benefit. On the market, therefore, there can be no such thing as exploita- tion . But the thesis of a conflict of interest is true whenever the State or any other agency intervenes on the market. For then the intervener gains only at the expense of subjects who lose in util- ity. On the market all is harmony. But as soon as intervention appears and is established, conflict is created, for each may par- ticipate in a scramble to be a net gainer rather than a net loser— to be part of the invading team, instead of one of the victims. It has become fashionable to assert that “Conservatives” like John C. Calhoun “anticipated” the Marxian doctrine of class exploitation. But the Marxian doctrine holds, erroneously, that there are “classes” on the free market whose interests clash and conflict. Calhoun’s insight was almost the reverse. Calhoun saw that it was the intervention of the State that in itself created the “classes” and the conflict. 5 He particularly perceived this in the 16 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 5 “Castes” would be a better term than “classes” here. Classes are any collection of units with a certain property in common. There is no reason"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"case of the binary intervention of taxes . For he saw that the pro- ceeds of taxes are used and spent, and that some people in the community must be net payers of tax funds, while the others are net recipients. Calhoun defined the latter as the “ruling class” of the exploiters, and the former as the “ruled” or exploited, and the distinction is quite a cogent one. Calhoun set forth his analysis brilliantly: Few, comparatively, as they are, the agents and employees of the government constitute that portion of the community who are the exclusive recipients of the proceeds of the taxes. Whatever amount is taken from the community in the form of taxes, if not lost, goes to them in the shape of expenditures or dis- bursements. The two—disbursement and taxation— constitute the fiscal action of the government. They are correlatives. What the one takes from the com- munity under the name of taxes is transferred to the portion of the community who are the recipients under that of disbursements. But as the recipients constitute only a portion of the community, it fol- lows, taking the two parts of the fiscal process together, that its action must be unequal between the payers of the taxes and the recipients of their pro- ceeds. Nor can it be otherwise; unless what is col- lected from each individual in the shape of taxes shall be returned to him in that of disbursements, which would make the process nugatory and absurd. . . . Such being the case, it must necessarily follow that some one portion of the community must pay in taxes more than it receives back in disbursements, while another receives in disbursements more than it pays Fundamentals of Intervention 17 for them to conflict. Does the class of men named Jones necessarily con- flict with the class of men named Smith? On the other hand, castes are State-made groups, each with its own set of violence-established privileges and tasks. Castes necessarily conflict because some are instituted to rule over the others."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"in taxes. It is, then, manifest, taking the whole process together, that taxes must be, in effect, bounties to that portion of the community which receives more in disbursements than it pays in taxes, while to the other which pays in taxes more than it receives in disburse- ments they are taxes in reality—burdens instead of bounties. This consequence is unavoidable. It results from the nature of the process, be the taxes ever so equally laid. . . . The necessary result, then, of the unequal fiscal action of the government is to divide the community into two great classes: one consisting of those who, in reality, pay the taxes and, of course, bear exclusively the burden of supporting the government; and the other, of those who are the recipients of their pro- ceeds through disbursements, and who are, in fact, supported by the government; or, in fewer words, to divide it into tax-payers and tax-consumers. But the effect of this is to place them in antagonistic relations in reference to the fiscal action of the gov- ernment and the entire course of policy therewith connected. For the greater the taxes and disburse- ments, the greater the gain of the one and the loss of the other, and vice versa. . . . 6 “Ruling” and “ruled” apply also to the forms of government intervention, but Calhoun was quite right in focusing on taxes and fiscal policy as the keystone, for it is taxes that supply the resources and payment for the State in performing its myriad other acts of intervention. All State intervention rests on the binary intervention of taxes at its base; even if the State intervened nowhere else, its taxation would remain. Since the term “social” can be applied 18 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 6 John C. Calhoun, A Disquisition on Government (New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1953), pp. 16–18. Calhoun, however, did not understand the harmony of interests on the free market."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"only to every single individual concerned, it is clear that, while the free market maximizes social utility, no act of the State can ever increase social utility. Indeed, the picture of the free mar- ket is necessarily one of harmony and mutual benefit; the pic- ture of State intervention is one of caste conflict, coercion, and exploitation. B. D EMOCRACY AND THE V OLUNTARY It might be objected that all these forms of intervention are really not coercive but “voluntary,” for in a democracy they are supported by the majority of the people. But this support is usu- ally passive, resigned, and apathetic, rather than eager— whether the State is a democracy or not. 7 In a democracy, the nonvoters can hardly be said to support the rulers, and neither can the voters for the losing side. But even those who voted for the winners may well have voted merely for the “lesser of the two evils.” The interesting ques- tion is: Why do they have to vote for any evil at all? Such terms are never used by people when they act freely for themselves, or when they purchase goods on the free market. No one thinks of his new suit or refrigerator as an “evil”—lesser or greater. In such cases, people think of themselves as buying positive “goods,” not as resignedly supporting a lesser bad. The point is that the public never has the opportunity of voting on the State Fundamentals of Intervention 19 7 As Professor Lindsay Rogers has trenchantly written on the subject of public opinion: Before Great Britain adopted conscription in 1939, only thirty-nine percent of the voters were for it; a week after the conscription bill became law, a poll showed that fifty- eight percent approved. Many polls in the United States have shown a similar inflation of support for a policy as soon as it is translated to the statute books or into a Pres- idential order.

However, the support may simply reflect apathy—perhaps from the resigned belief that the State is a permanent if unwelcome fixture of nature. Witness the motto: “Nothing is as permanent as death and taxes.” Setting all these matters aside, however, and even granting that a State might be enthusiastically supported by a majority, we still do not establish its voluntary nature. For the majority is not society, is not everyone. Majority coercion over the minor- ity is still coercion. Since States exist, and they are accepted for generations and centuries, we must conclude that a majority are at least passive supporters of all States—for no minority can for long rule an actively hostile majority. In a certain sense, therefore, all tyranny is majority tyranny, regardless of the formalities of the government structure. 9, 10 But this does not change our analytic 20 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 8 This coercion would exist even in the most direct democracies. It is doubly compounded in representative republics , where the people never have a chance of voting on issues, but only on the men who rule them. They can only reject men—and this at very long intervals—and if the candidates have the same views on issues, the public cannot effect any sort of fundamental change. 9 It is often stated that under “modern” conditions of destructive weapons, etc., a minority can tyrannize permanently over a majority. But this ignores the fact that these weapons can be held by the majority, or that agents of the minority can mutiny. The sheer absurdity, for example, of the current belief that a few million could really tyrannize over a few hundred million active resistants is not often realized.

U TILITY AND R ESISTANCE TO I NVASION To our comparative “welfare-economic” analysis of the free market and the State, it might be objected that when defense agencies restrain an invader from attacking someone’s property, they are benefiting the property owner at the expense of a loss of utility by the would-be invader. Since defense agencies enforce rights on the free market, does not the free market also involve a gain by some at the expense of the utility of others (even if these others are invaders)? In answer, we may state first that the free market is a society in which all exchange voluntarily. It may most easily be con- ceived as a situation in which no one aggresses against person or property. In that case, it is obvious that the utility of all is maxi- mized on the free market. Defense agencies become necessary only as a defense against invasions of that market. It is the invader, not the existence of the defense agency, that inflicts Fundamentals of Intervention 21 sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find that because Force is always on the side of the gov- erned, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is, therefore, on opinion that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments.

For an analysis of the types of opinion fos- tered by the State in order to obtain public support, see Bertrand de Jou- venel, On Power (New York: Viking Press, 1949). 10 This analysis of majority support applies to any intervention of rather long standing, carried on frankly and openly, whether or not the groups are labeled “States.” 11 See Calhoun, Disquisition on Government , pp. 14, 18–19, 23–33."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"losses on his fellowmen. A defense agency existing without an invader would simply be a voluntarily established insurance against attack. The existence of a defense agency does not vio- late the principle of maximum utility, and it still reflects mutual benefit to all concerned. Conflict enters only with the invader. The invader, let us say, is in the process of committing an aggressive act against Smith, thereby injuring Smith for his gain. The defense agency, rushing to the aid of Smith, of course, injures the invader’s utility; but it does so only to counteract the injury to Smith. It does help to maximize the utility of the non- criminals. The principle of conflict and loss of utility was intro- duced, not by the existence of the defense agency, but by the existence of the invader. It is still true, therefore, that utility is maximized for all on the free market; whereas to the extent that there is invasive interference in society, it is infected with con- flict and exploitation of man by man. D. T HE A RGUMENT FROM E NVY Another objection holds that the free market does not really increase the utility of all individuals, because some may be so smitten with envy at the success of others that they really lose in utility as a result. We cannot, however, deal with hypotheti- cal utilities divorced from concrete action. We may, as praxeolo- gists , deal only with utilities that we can deduce from the con- crete behavior of human beings. 12 A person’s “envy,” unembod- ied in action, becomes pure moonshine from the praxeological point of view. All that we know is that he has participated in the free market and to that extent benefits by it. How he feels about the exchanges made by others cannot be demonstrated to us 22 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 12 Elsewhere, we have named this concept “demonstrated preference,” have traced its history, and have directed a critique against competing concepts.

Even if he publishes a pam- phlet denouncing these exchanges, we have no ironclad proof that this is not a joke or a deliberate lie. E. U TILITY E X P OST We have thus seen that individuals maximize their utility ex ante on the free market and that the direct result of an invasion is that the invader’s utility gains at the expense of a loss in util- ity by his victim. But what about utilities ex post ? People may expect to benefit when they make a decision, but do they actu- ally benefit from its results? The remainder of this volume will largely consist of analysis of what we may call the “indirect” consequences of the market or of intervention, supplementing the above direct analysis. It will deal with chains of conse- quences that can be grasped only by study and are not immedi- ately visible to the naked eye. Error can always occur in the path from ante to post , but the free market is so constructed that this error is reduced to a min- imum. In the first place, there is a fast-working, easily under- standable test that tells the entrepreneur, as well as the income- receiver, whether he is succeeding or failing at the task of satis- fying the desires of the consumer. For the entrepreneur, who carries the main burden of adjustment to uncertain consumer desires, the test is swift and sure—profits or losses. Large prof- its are a signal that he has been on the right track; losses, that he has been on a wrong one. Profits and losses thus spur rapid adjustments to consumer demands; at the same time, they per- form the function of getting money out of the hands of the bad entrepreneurs and into the hands of the good ones. The fact that good entrepreneurs prosper and add to their capital, and poor ones are driven out, insures an ever smoother market adjustment to changes in conditions. Similarly, to a lesser extent, land and labor factors move in accordance with the desire of their owners for higher incomes, and more value-pro- ductive factors are rewarded accordingly. Fundamentals of Intervention 23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Consumers also take entrepreneurial risks on the market. Many critics of the market, while willing to concede the expert- ise of the capitalist-entrepreneurs, bewail the prevailing igno- rance of consumers, which prevents them from gaining the utility ex post that they expected to have ex ante . Typically, Wes- ley C. Mitchell entitled one of his famous essays: “The Back- ward Art of Spending Money.” Professor Ludwig von Mises has keenly pointed out the paradoxical position of so many “pro- gressives” who insist that consumers are too ignorant or incom- petent to buy products intelligently, while at the same time touting the virtues of democracy, where the same people vote for politicians whom they do not know and for policies that they hardly understand. In fact, the truth is precisely the reverse of the popular ide- ology. Consumers are not omniscient, but they do have direct tests by which to acquire their knowledge. They buy a certain brand of breakfast food and they don’t like it; so they don’t buy it again. They buy a certain type of automobile and they do like its performance; so they buy another one. In both cases, they tell their friends of this newly won knowledge. Other con- sumers patronize consumers’ research organizations, which can warn or advise them in advance. But, in all cases, the consumers have the direct test of results to guide them. And the firm that satisfies the consumers expands and prospers, while the firm that fails to satisfy them goes out of business. On the other hand, voting for politicians and public policies is a completely different matter. Here there are no direct tests of success or failure whatever, neither profits and losses nor enjoyable or unsatisfying consumption. In order to grasp con- sequences, especially the indirect consequences of governmen- tal decisions, it is necessary to comprehend a complex chain of praxeological reasoning, such as will be developed in this vol- ume. Very few voters have the ability or the interest to follow such reasoning, particularly, as Schumpeter points out, in polit- ical situations. For in political situations, the minute influence 24 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"that any one person has on the results, as well as the seeming remoteness of the actions, induces people to lose interest in political problems or argumentation. 13 Lacking the direct test of success or failure, the voter tends to turn, not to those politi- cians whose measures have the best chance of success, but to those with the ability to “sell” their propaganda. Without grasp- ing logical chains of deduction, the average voter will never be able to discover the error that the ruler makes. Thus, suppose that the government inflates the money supply, thereby causing an inevitable rise in prices. The government can blame the price rise on wicked speculators or alien black marketeers, and, unless the public knows economics, it will not be able to see the falla- cies in the ruler’s arguments. It is ironic that those writers who complain of the wiles and lures of advertising do not direct their criticism at the advertis- ing of political campaigns, where their charges would be rele- vant. As Schumpeter states: The picture of the prettiest girl that ever lived will in the long run prove powerless to maintain the sales of a bad cigarette. There is no equally effective safe- guard in the case of political decisions. Many deci- sions of fateful importance are of a nature that makes it impossible for the public to experiment with them at its leisure and at moderate cost. Even if that is pos- sible, however, judgment is as a rule not so easy to arrive at as it is in the case of the cigarette, because effects are less easy to interpret. 14 It might be objected that, while the average voter may not be competent to decide on policies that require for his decision chains of praxeological reasoning, he is competent to pick the Fundamentals of Intervention 25 13 Joseph A.

But the point is precisely that in government the individual does not have the direct, personal test of success or failure for his hired expert that he does on the market. On the market, individuals tend to patronize those experts whose advice proves most successful. Good doctors or lawyers reap rewards on the free market, while the poor ones fail; the privately hired expert tends to flourish in proportion to his demonstrated ability. In government, on the other hand, there is no concrete test of the expert’s success. In the absence of such a test, there is no way by which the voter can gauge the true expertise of the man he must vote for. This difficulty is aggravated in modern-style elections, where the candidates agree on all the fundamental issues. For issues, after all, are susceptible to reasoning; the voter can , if he so wishes and he has the ability, learn about and decide on the issues. But what can any voter, even the most intelligent, know about the true expertise or competence of individual candidates, especially when elections are shorn of virtually all important issues? The voter can then fall back only on the purely external, packaged “personalities” or images of the candidates. The result is that voting purely on candidates makes the result even less rational than mass voting on the issues themselves. Furthermore, the government itself contains inherent mechanisms that lead to poor choices of experts and officials. For one thing, the politician and the government expert receive their revenues, not from service voluntarily purchased on the market, but from a compulsory levy on the populace. These officials, therefore, wholly lack the pecuniary incentive to care about serving the public properly and competently. And, what is more, the vital criterion of “fitness” is very different in the gov- ernment and on the market. In the market, the fittest are those most able to serve the consumers; in government, the fittest are those most adept at wielding coercion and/or those most adroit at making demagogic appeals to the voting public. 26 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Another critical divergence between market action and democratic voting is this: the voter has, for example, only a 1 /50 millionth power to choose among his would-be rulers, who in turn will make vital decisions affecting him, unchecked and unhampered until the next election. In the market, on the other hand, the individual has the absolute sovereign power to make the decisions concerning his person and property, not merely a distant, 1 /50 millionth power. On the market the individual is continually demonstrating his choice of buying or not buying, selling or not selling, in the course of making absolute decisions regarding his property. The voter, by voting for some particular candidate, is demonstrating only a relative preference over one or two other potential rulers; he must do this within the frame- work of the coercive rule that, whether or not he votes at all, one of these men will rule over him for the next several years. 15 Thus, we see that the free market contains a smooth, effi- cient mechanism for bringing anticipated, ex ante utility into the realization of ex post. The free market always maximizes ex ante social utility as well. In political action, on the contrary, there is no such mechanism; indeed, the political process inherently tends to delay and thwart the realization of any expected gains. Furthermore, the divergence between ex post gains through government and through the market is even greater than this; for we shall find that in every instance of government interven- tion, the indirect consequences will be such as to make the inter- vention appear worse in the eyes of many of its original sup- porters. In sum, the free market always benefits every participant, and it maximizes social utility ex ante ; it also tends to do so ex post , since it works for the rapid conversion of anticipations into realizations.

Thus, the intervener can prohibit the sale of a certain product or can prohibit a sale above or below a certain price. We can therefore divide triangular inter- vention into two types: price control , which deals with the terms of an exchange, and product control , which deals with the nature of the product or of the producer. Price control will have reper- cussions on production, and product control on prices, but the two types of control have different effects and can be conve- niently separated. 1. Price Control The intervener may set either a minimum price below which a product cannot be sold, or a maximum price above which it cannot be sold. He can also compel a sale at a certain fixed price. In any event, the price control will either be ineffective or effec- tive . It will be ineffective if the regulation has no current influ- ence on the market price. Thus, suppose that automobiles are all selling at about 100 gold ounces on the market. The gov- ernment issues a decree prohibiting all sales of autos below 20 gold ounces, on pain of violence inflicted on all violators. This 29 3 T RIANGULAR I NTERVENTION"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"decree is, in the present state of the market, completely ineffec- tive and academic, since no cars would have sold below 20 ounces. The price control yields only irrelevant jobs for gov- ernment bureaucrats. On the other hand, the price control may be effective, i.e., it may change the price from what it would have been on the free market. Let the diagram in Figure 1 depict the supply and demand curves, respectively SS and DD , for the good. 30 Power and Market: Government and the Economy FP is the equilibrium price set by the market. Now, let us assume that the intervener imposes a maximum control price 0C , above which any sale becomes illegal. At the control price, the market is no longer cleared, and the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied by the amount AB . In the ensuing shortage, consumers rush to buy goods that are not available at the price. Some must do without; others must patronize the market, revived as “black” or illegal, while paying a premium for the risk of punishment that sellers now undergo. The chief characteristic of a price maximum is the queue, the endless “lin- ing up” for goods that are not sufficient to supply the people at the rear of the line. All sorts of subterfuges are invented by peo- ple desperately seeking to arrive at the clearance provided by the market. “Under-the-table” deals, bribes, favoritism for"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"older customers, etc., are inevitable features of a market shack- led by the price maximum. 1 It must be noted that, even if the stock of a good is frozen for the foreseeable future, and the supply line is vertical, this artifi- cial shortage will still develop, and all these consequences ensue. The more “elastic” the supply, i.e., the more resources will shift out of production, the more aggravated, ceteris paribus, the shortage will be. If the price control is “selective,” i.e., is imposed on one or a few products, the economy will not be as universally dislocated as under general maxima, but the artificial shortage created in the particular line will be even more pro- nounced, since entrepreneurs and factors can shift to the pro- duction and sale of other products (preferably substitutes). The prices of the substitutes will go up as the “excess” demand is channeled off in their direction. In the light of this fact, the typ- ical government reason for selective price control—“we must impose controls on this product as long as it is in short sup- ply”—is revealed to be an almost ludicrous error. For the truth is precisely the reverse: price control creates an artificial short- age of the product, which continues as long as the control is in existence—in fact, becomes ever worse as resources continue to shift to other products. Before investigating further the effects of general price max- ima, let us analyze the consequences of a minimum price con- trol, i.e., the imposition of a price above the free-market price. This may be depicted as in Figure 2. DD and SS are the demand and supply curves respectively. 0C is the control price and FP the market equilibrium price. At 0C , the quantity demanded is less than the quantity supplied, by the amount AB . Thus, while the effect of a maximum price is to create an artificial shortage, a minimum price creates an Triangular Intervention 31 1 Bribing is made necessary by government outlawing of the exchange; a bribe is the sale, by the government official, of permission for the exchanges to proceed."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"artificial unsold surplus. AB is the unsold surplus. The unsold surplus exists even if the SS line is vertical, but a more elastic supply will, ceteris paribus , aggravate the surplus. Once again, the market is not cleared. The artificially high price attracts resources into the field, while, at the same time, it discourages buyer demand. Under selective price control, resources will leave other fields where they serve their owners and the con- sumers better, and transfer to this field, where they overproduce and suffer losses as a result. This illustrates how intervention, by tampering with the market, causes entrepreneurial losses. Entrepreneurs operate on the basis of certain criteria: prices, interest rates, etc., estab- lished by the free market. Interventionary tampering with these criteria destroys the adjustment and brings about losses, as well as misallocation of resources in satisfying consumer wants. General, overall price maxima dislocate the entire economy and deny the consumers the enjoyment of substitutes. General price maxima are usually imposed for the announced purpose of “preventing inflation”—invariably while the government is inflating the money supply by a large amount. Overall price maxima are equivalent to imposing a minimum on the purchas- ing power of the money unit, the PPM (see Figure 3). 32 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"0F is the money stock in the society; D m D m the social demand for money; FP is the equilibrium PPM (purchasing power of the monetary unit) set by the market. An imposed minimum PPM above the market ( 0C ) impairs the clearing “mechanism” of the market. At 0C the money stock exceeds the money demanded. As a result, the people possess a quantity of money GH in “unsold surplus.” They try to sell their money by buying goods, but they cannot. Their money is anesthetized. To the extent that a government’s overall price maximum is upheld, a part of the people’s money becomes useless, for it cannot be exchanged. But a mad scramble inevitably takes place, with each one hoping that his money can be used. 2 Favoritism, lining up, bribes, etc., inevitably abound, as well as great pressure for the “black” market (i.e., the market) to provide a channel for the surplus money. Triangular Intervention 33 2 Ironically, the government’s destruction of part of the people’s money almost always takes place after the government has pumped in new money and used it for its own purposes. The injury that the govern- ment imposes on the public is thus twofold: (1) it takes resources away from the public by inflating the currency; and (2) after the money has percolated down to the public, it destroys part of the money’s usefulness."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"A general price minimum is equivalent to a maximum control on the PPM. This sets up an unsatisfied, excess demand for money over the stock of money available—specifically, in the form of unsold stocks of goods in every field. The principles of maximum and minimum price control apply to all prices, whatever they may be: consumer goods, cap- ital goods, land or labor services, or the “price” of money in terms of other goods. They apply, for example, to minimum wage laws. When a minimum wage law is effective, i.e., where it imposes a wage above the market value of a type of labor (above the laborer’s discounted marginal value product), the supply of labor services exceeds the demand, and this “unsold surplus” of labor services means involuntary mass unemployment. Selective, as opposed to general, minimum wage rates create unemployment in particular industries and tend to perpetuate these pockets by attracting labor to the higher rates. Labor is eventually forced to enter less remunerative, less value-produc- tive lines. The result is the same whether the effective minimum wage is imposed by the State or by a labor union. Our analysis of the effects of price control applies also, as Mises has brilliantly shown, to control over the price (“exchange rate”) of one money in terms of another. 3 This was partially seen in Gresham’s Law, but few have realized that this Law is merely a specific case of the general law of the effect of price controls. Perhaps this failure is due to the misleading formulation of Gre- sham’s Law, which is usually phrased: “Bad money drives good money out of circulation.” Taken at its face value, this is a para- dox that violates the general rule of the market that the best methods of satisfying consumers tend to win out over the poorer. Even those who generally favor the free market have used this phrasing to justify a State monopoly over the coinage of gold and silver. Actually, Gresham’s Law should read: “Money overvalued by the State will drive money undervalued by the 34 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 3 Ludwig von Mises, Human Action (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1949), pp. 432 n., 447, 469, 776."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"State out of circulation.” Whenever the State sets an arbitrary value or price on one money in terms of another, it thereby estab- lishes an effective minimum price control on one money and a maximum price control on the other, the “prices” being in terms of each other. This, for example, was the essence of bimetallism. Under bimetallism, a nation recognized gold and silver as mon- eys, but set an arbitrary price, or exchange ratio, between them. When this arbitrary price differed, as it was bound to do, from the free-market price (and such a discrepancy became ever more likely as time passed and the free-market price changed, while the government’s arbitrary price remained the same), one money became overvalued and the other undervalued by the govern- ment. Thus, suppose that a country used gold and silver as money, and the government set the ratio between them at 16 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold. The market price, perhaps 16:1 at the time of the price control, then changes to 15:1. What is the result? Silver is now being arbitrarily undervalued by the government, and gold arbitrarily overvalued. In other words, sil- ver is forced to be cheaper than it really is in terms of gold on the market, and gold is forced to be more expensive than it really is in terms of silver. The government has imposed a maximum price on silver and a minimum price on gold, in terms of each other. The same consequences now follow as from any effective price control. With a maximum price on silver (and a minimum price on gold), the gold demand for silver in exchange exceeds the silver demand for gold. Gold goes begging for silver in unsold surplus, while silver becomes scarce and disappears from circulation. Silver disappears to another country or area where it can be exchanged at the free-market price, and gold, in turn, flows into the country. If the bimetallism is worldwide, then sil- ver disappears into the “black” market, and official or open exchanges are made only with gold. No country, therefore, can maintain a bimetallic system in practice, because one money will always be under- or overvalued in terms of the other. The over- valued will always displace the undervalued from circulation. Triangular Intervention 35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"It is possible to move, by government decree, from a specie money to a fiat paper currency. In effect, almost every govern- ment of the world has done so. As a result, each country has been saddled with its own money. In a free market, each fiat money will tend to exchange for another according to the fluctuations in their respective purchasing-power parities. Suppose, however, that Currency X has an arbitrary valuation placed by its govern- ment on its exchange rate with Currency Y. Thus, suppose five units of X exchange for one unit of Y on the free market. Now suppose that Country X artificially overvalues its currency and sets a fixed exchange rate of three X’s to one Y. What is the result? A minimum price has been set on X’s in terms of Y, and a maximum price on Y’s in terms of X. Consequently, everyone scrambles to exchange X’s for Y’s at this cheap price for Y and thus profit on the market. There is an excess demand for Y in terms of X, and a surplus of X in relation to Y. Here is the expla- nation of that supposedly mysterious “dollar shortage” that plagued Europe after World War II. The European govern- ments all overvalued their national currencies in terms of Amer- ican dollars. As a consequence of the price control, dollars became short in terms of European currency, and the latter became a glut looking for dollars without finding them. Another example of money-ratio price control is seen in the ancient problem of new versus worn coins. There grew up the custom of stamping coins with some name designating their weight in specie in terms of some unit of weight. Eventually, to “simplify” matters, governments began to decree worn coins to be equal in value to newly minted coins of the same denomina- tion. 4 Thus, suppose that a 20-ounce silver coin was declared equal in value to a worn-out coin now weighing 18 ounces. What ensued was the inevitable effect of price control. The 36 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 4 Perhaps one of the reasons was that State mint monopolies, instead of serving customers with desired coins, arbitrarily designated a few denominations that they would mint and circulate. A coin of slightly lighter weight was then treated as an intruder."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"government had arbitrarily undervalued new coins and overval- ued old ones. New coins were far too cheap, and old ones too expensive. As a result, the new coins promptly disappeared from circulation, to flow abroad or to remain under cover at home; and the old worn coins flooded in. This proved discouraging for the State mints, which could not keep coins in circulation, no matter how many they minted. 5 The striking effects of Gresham’s Law are partly due to a type of intervention adopted by almost every government—legal-ten- der laws. At any time in society there is a mass of unpaid debt contracts outstanding, representing credit transactions begun in the past and scheduled to be completed in the future. It is the responsibility of judicial agencies to enforce these contracts. Through laxity, the practice developed of stipulating in the con- tract that payment will be made in “money” without specifying which money. Governments then passed legal-tender laws, arbi- trarily designating what is meant by “money” even when the creditors and debtors themselves would be willing to settle on something else. When the State decrees as money something other than what the parties to a transaction have in mind, an intervention has taken place, and the effects of Gresham’s Law will begin to appear. Specifically, assume the existence of the bimetallic system mentioned above. When contracts were origi- nally made, gold was worth 16 ounces of silver; now it is worth only 15. Yet the legal-tender laws specify “money” as being an equivalent of 16:1. As a result of these laws, everyone pays all his debts in the overvalued gold. Legal-tender laws reinforce the consequences of exchange-rate control, and the debtors have gained a privilege at the expense of their creditors. 6 Triangular Intervention 37 5 A modern example of the impossibility of keeping undervalued coins in circulation is the disappearance of silver dollars, half-dollars, and other coins that circulated in the United States during the 1960’s.

These laws place legal maxima on interest rates, outlawing any lending transactions at a higher rate. The amount and proportion of saving and the market rate of inter- est are basically determined by the time-preference rates of individuals. An effective usury law acts like other maxima—to induce a shortage of the service. For time preferences—and therefore the “natural” interest rate—remain the same. The fact that this interest rate is now illegal means that the marginal savers—those whose time preferences were highest—now stop saving, and the quantity of saving and investing in the economy declines. This results in lower productivity and lower standards of living in the future. Some people stop saving; others even dis- save and consume their capital. The extent to which this hap- pens depends on how effective the usury laws are, i.e., how far they hamper and distort voluntary market relations. Usury laws are designed, at least ostensibly, to help the bor- rower, particularly the most risky borrower, who is “forced” to pay high interest rates to compensate for the added risk. Yet it is precisely these borrowers who are most hurt by usury laws. If the legal maximum is not too low, there will not be a serious decline in aggregate savings. But the maximum is below the market rate for the most risky borrowers (where the entrepre- neurial component of interest is highest), and hence they are deprived of all credit facilities. When interest is voluntary, the lender will be able to charge very high interest rates for his loans, and thus anyone will be able to borrow if he pays the price. Where interest is controlled, many would-be borrowers are deprived of credit altogether. 7 38 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 7 In recent years, the myth has developed that usury laws in the Mid- dle Ages were justifiable because they dealt with the consumer who had to borrow rather than with productive business. On the contrary, it is pre- cisely the risky consumer-borrower (who most “needs” the loan) who is most injured by the usury laws because he is the one deprived of credit."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Usury laws not only diminish savings available for lending and investment, but create an artificial “shortage” of credit, a perpetual condition where there is an excessive demand for credit at the legal rate. Instead of going to those most able and efficient, the credit will therefore have to be “rationed” by the lenders in some artificial and uneconomic way. Although there have rarely been minimum interest rates imposed by government, their effect is similar to that of maxi- mum rate control. For whenever time preferences and the nat- ural interest rate fall, this condition is reflected in increased sav- ings and investment. But when the government imposes a legal minimum, the interest rate cannot fall, and the people will not be able to carry through their increased investment, which would bid up factor prices. Minimum interest rates, therefore, also stunt economic development and impede a rise in living standards. Marginal borrowers would likewise be forced out of the market and deprived of credit. To the extent that the market illegally reasserts itself, the interest rate on the loan will be higher to compensate for the extra risk of arrest under usury laws. To sum up our analysis of the effects of price control: Directly, the utility of at least one set of exchangers will be impaired by the control. Further analysis reveals that the hid- den, but just as certain, effects are to injure a substantial num- ber of people who had thought they would gain in utility from the imposed controls. The announced aim of a maximum price control is to benefit the consumer by insuring his supply at a lower price; yet the objective result is to prevent many con- sumers from acquiring the good at all. The announced aim of a minimum price control is to insure higher prices for the sellers; yet the effect will be to prevent many sellers from selling any of Triangular Intervention 39 On usury laws, see Rudolph C.

Furthermore, price controls distort production and the allocation of resources and factors in the economy, thereby injuring again the bulk of consumers. And we must not overlook the army of bureaucrats who must be financed by the binary intervention of taxation, and who must administer and enforce the myriad of regulations. This army, in itself, with- draws a mass of workers from productive labor and saddles them onto the backs of the remaining producers—thereby ben- efiting the bureaucrats, but injuring the rest of the people. This, of course, is the consequence of establishing an army of bureau- crats for any interventionary purpose whatever. 2. Product Control: Prohibition Another form of triangular intervention is interference with the nature of production directly, rather than with the terms of exchange. This occurs when the government prohibits any pro- duction or sale of a certain product. The consequence is injury to all parties concerned: to the consumers, who lose utility because they cannot purchase the product and satisfy their most urgent wants; and to the producers, who are prevented from earning a higher remuneration in this field and must therefore be content with lower earnings elsewhere. This loss is borne not so much by entrepreneurs, who earn from ephemeral adjust- ments, or by capitalists, who tend to earn a uniform interest rate throughout the economy, as by laborers and landowners, who must accept permanently lower income. The only ones who benefit from the regulation, then, are the government bureau- crats themselves—partly from the tax-created jobs that the reg- ulation creates, and perhaps also from the satisfaction gained from repressing others and wielding coercive power over them. Whereas with price control one could at least make out a prima facie case that one set of exchangers—producers or consumers— is being benefited, no such case can be made out for prohibition , where both parties to the exchange, producers and consumers, invariably lose. 40 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In many instances of product prohibition, of course, inevitable pressure develops for the reestablishment of the mar- ket illegally, i.e., as a “black” market. As in the case of price con- trol, a black market creates difficulties because of its illegality. The supply of the product will be scarcer, and the price of the product will be higher to compensate the producers for the risk of violating the law; and the more strict the prohibition and penalties, the scarcer the product and the higher the price will be. Furthermore, the illegality hinders the process of distribut- ing to the consumers information (e.g., by way of advertising) about the existence of the market. As a result, the organization of the market will be far less efficient, the service to the con- sumer will decline in quality, and prices again will be higher than under a legal market. The premium on secrecy in the “black” market also militates against large-scale business, which is likely to be more visible and therefore more vulnerable to law enforcement. The advantages of efficient large-scale organiza- tion are thus lost, injuring the consumer and raising prices because of the diminished supply. 8 Paradoxically, the prohibi- tion may serve as a form of grant of monopolistic privilege to the black marketeers, since they are likely to be very different entrepreneurs from those who would succeed in a legal market. For in the black market, rewards accrue to skill in bypassing the law or in bribing government officials. There are various types of prohibition. There is absolute pro- hibition, where the product is completely outlawed. There are also forms of partial prohibition : an example is rationing , where consumption beyond a certain amount is prohibited by the State. The clear effect of rationing is to injure consumers and Triangular Intervention 41 8 It is interesting to note that the bulk of “organized crime” occurs not as invasions of persons and property (in natural law, the mala per se ), but as attempts to circumvent government prohibitions in order to satisfy the desires of consumers and producers alike more efficiently (the mala pro- hibita ). Entrepreneurs of the latter kind constitute the generally despised “black marketeers” and “racketeers.”"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"lower the standard of living of everyone. Since rationing places legal maxima on specific items of consumption, it also distorts the pattern of consumers’ spending. The unrationed, or less stringently rationed, goods are bought more heavily, whereas consumers would have preferred to buy more of the rationed goods. Thus, consumer spending is coercively shifted from the more to the less heavily rationed commodities. Moreover, the ration tickets introduce a new type of quasi money; the func- tions of money on the market are crippled and atrophied, and confusion reigns. The main function of money is to be bought by producers and spent by consumers; but, under rationing, consumers are estopped from using their money to the full and blocked from using their dollars to direct and allocate factors of production. They must also use arbitrarily designated and dis- tributed ration tickets—an inefficient kind of double money. The pattern of consumer spending is particularly distorted, and since ration tickets are usually not transferable, people who do not want brand X are not permitted to exchange these coupons for goods not wanted by others. 9 Priorities and allocations by the government are another type of prohibition, as well as another jumbling of the price system. Efficient buyers are prevented from obtaining goods, while inefficient ones find that they can acquire a plethora. Efficient firms are no longer allowed to bid away factors or resources from inefficient firms; the efficient firms are, in effect, crippled, and the inefficient ones subsidized. Government priorities again basically introduce another form of double money. Maximum-hour laws enforce compulsory idleness and pro- hibit work. They are a direct attack on production, injuring the worker who wants to work, reducing his earnings, and lowering 42 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 9 The workings of rationing (as well as the socialist system in general) have never been more vividly portrayed than in Henry Hazlitt’s novel, The Great Idea (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1951), reissued as Time Will Run Back (New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1967)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the living standards of the entire society. 10 Conservation laws , which also prevent production and cause lower living standards, will be discussed more fully below. In fact, the monopoly grants of privilege discussed in the next section are also prohibitions, since they grant the privilege of production to some by pro- hibiting production to others. 3. Product Control: Grant of Monopolistic Privilege Instead of making the product prohibition absolute, the gov- ernment may prohibit production and sale except by a certain firm or firms. These firms are then specially privileged by the government to engage in a line of production, and therefore this type of prohibition is a grant of special privilege . If the grant is to one person or firm, it is a monopoly grant; if to several per- sons or firms, it is a quasi-monopoly or oligopoly grant. Both types of grant may be called monopolistic . It is obvious that the grant benefits the monopolist or quasi monopolist because his com- petitors are barred by violence from entering the field; it is also evident that the would-be competitors are injured and are forced to accept lower remuneration in less efficient and value- productive fields. The consumers are likewise injured, for they are prevented from purchasing their products from competitors whom they would freely prefer. And this injury takes place apart from any effect of the grant on prices. Although a monopolistic grant may openly and directly con- fer a privilege and exclude rivals, in the present day it is far more likely to be hidden or indirect, cloaked as a type of penalty on competitors, and represented as favorable to the “general wel- fare.” The effects of monopolistic grants are the same, however, whether they are direct or indirect.

The theory of monopoly price is illusory when applied to the free market, but it applies fully to the case of monopoly and quasi-monopoly grants. For here we have an identifiable distinc- tion—not the spurious distinction between “competitive” and “monopoly” or “monopolistic” price—but one between the free- market price and the monopoly price . For the free-market price is conceptually identifiable and definable, whereas the “competi- tive price” is not. 11 The monopolist, as a receiver of a monopoly privilege, will be able to achieve a monopoly price for the prod- uct if his demand curve is inelastic, or sufficiently less elastic, above the free-market price. On the free market, every demand curve to a firm is elastic above the free-market price; otherwise the firm would have an incentive to raise its price and increase its rev- enue. But the grant of monopoly privilege renders the consumer demand curve less elastic, for the consumer is deprived of substi- tute products from other would-be competitors. Where the demand curve to the firm remains highly elastic, the monopolist will not reap a monopoly gain from his grant. Consumers and competitors will still be injured because of the prevention of their trade, but the monopolist will not gain, because his price and income will be no higher than before. On the other hand, if his demand curve is now inelastic, then he institutes a monopoly price so as to maximize his revenue. His production has to be restricted in order to command the higher price. The restriction of production and the higher price for the product both injure the consumers. In contrast to conditions on the free market, we may no longer say that a restriction of production (such as in a voluntary cartel) benefits the consumers by arriving at the most value-productive point; on the contrary, the consumers are injured because their free choice would have resulted in the free-market price. Because of coercive force applied by the State, they may not purchase goods freely from all those willing to sell. In other words, any 44 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"approach toward the free-market equilibrium price and output point for any product benefits the consumers and thereby ben- efits the producers as well. Any movement away from the free- market price and output injures the consumers. The monopoly price resulting from a grant of monopoly privilege leads away from the free-market price; it lowers output and raises prices beyond what would be established if consumers and producers could trade freely. We cannot here use the argument that the restriction of out- put is voluntary because the consumers make their own demand curve inelastic. For the consumers are fully responsible for their demand curve only on the free marke t; and only this demand curve can be treated as an expression of their voluntary choice. Once the government steps in to prohibit trade and grant priv- ileges, there is no longer wholly voluntary action. Consumers are forced, willy-nilly, to deal with the monopolist for a certain range of purchases. All the effects that the monopoly-price theorists have mis- takenly attributed to voluntary cartels do apply to governmental monopoly grants. Production is restricted and factors misallo- cated. It is true that the nonspecific factors are again released for production elsewhere. But now we can say that this produc- tion will satisfy the consumers less than under free-market con- ditions; furthermore, the factors will earn less in the other occu- pations. There can never be lasting monopoly profits , since profits are ephemeral, and all eventually reduce to a uniform interest return. In the long run, monopoly returns are imputed to some factor . What is the factor that is being monopolized in this case? It is obvious that this factor is the right to enter the industry. In the free market, this right is unlimited to all; here, however, the government has granted special privileges of entry and sale, and it is these special privileges or rights that are responsible for the extra monopoly gain from the monopoly price. The monopolist earns a monopoly gain, therefore, not for owning any productive Triangular Intervention 45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"factor, but from a special privilege granted by the government. And this gain does not disappear in the long run as do profits; it is permanent, so long as the privilege remains, and consumer valuations continue as they are. Of course, the monopoly gain will tend to be capitalized into the asset value of the firm, so that subsequent owners, who invest in the firm after the privilege is granted and the capitalization takes place, will be earning only the generally uniform interest return on their investment. This whole discussion applies to the quasi monopolist as well as to the monopolist. The quasi monopolist has some competi- tors, but their number is restricted by the government privilege. Each quasi monopolist will now have a differently shaped demand curve for his product on the market and will be affected differently by the privilege. Those quasi monopolists whose demand curves become inelastic will reap a monopoly gain; those whose demand curves remain highly elastic will reap no gain from the privilege. Ceteris paribus , of course, a monopolist is more likely to achieve a monopoly gain than a quasi monop- olist; but whether each achieves a gain, and how much, depends purely on the data of each particular case. We must note again what we have said above: that even where no monopolist or quasi monopolist can achieve a monop- oly price, the consumers are still injured because they are barred from buying from the most efficient and value-productive pro- ducers. Production is thereby restricted, and the decrease in out- put (particularly of the most efficiently produced output) raises the price to consumers. If the monopolist or quasi monopolist also achieves a monopoly price, the injury to consumers and the misallocation of production will be redoubled. Since outright grants of monopoly or quasi monopoly would usually be considered baldly injurious to the public, governments have discovered a variety of methods of granting such privileges indirectly, as well as a variety of arguments to justify these measures. But they all have the effects common to monopoly or quasi-monopoly grants and monopoly prices when these are obtained. 46 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The important types of monopolistic grants (monopoly and quasi monopoly) are as follows: (1) governmentally enforced car- tels which every firm in an industry is compelled to join; (2) vir- tual cartels imposed by the government, such as the production quotas enforced by American agricultural policy; (3) licenses , which require meeting government rules before a man or a firm is permitted to enter a certain line of production, and which also require the payment of a fee—a payment that serves as a penalty tax on smaller firms with less capital, which are thereby debarred from competing with larger firms; (4) “quality” standards, which prohibit competition by what the government (not the con- sumers) defines as “lower-quality” products; (5) tariffs and other measures that levy a penalty tax on competitors outside a given geographical region; (6) immigration restrictions, which prohibit the competition of laborers, as well as entrepreneurs, who would otherwise move from another geographical region of the world market; (7) child labor laws, which prohibit the labor competition of workers below a certain age; (8) minimum wage laws, which, by causing the unemployment of the least value-productive work- ers, remove their competition from the labor markets; (9) maxi- mum hour laws , which force partial unemployment on those workers who are willing to work longer hours; (10) compulsory unionism, such as the Wagner-Taft-Hartley Act imposes, causing unemployment among the workers with the least seniority or the least political influence in their union; (11) conscription , which forces many young men out of the labor force; (12) any sort of governmental penalty on any form of industrial or market organization, such as antitrust laws , special chain store taxes, corpo- rate income taxes, laws closing businesses at specific hours or out- lawing pushcart peddlers or door-to-door salesmen ; (13) conservation laws , which restrict production by force; (14) patents , where inde- pendent later discoverers of a process are debarred from enter- ing a field production. 12,13 Triangular Intervention 47 12 For an interesting, though incomplete, discussion of many of these measures (an area largely neglected by economists), see Fritz Machlup,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"A. C OMPULSORY C ARTELS Compulsory cartels are a forcing of all producers in an indus- try into one organization, or virtual organization. Instead of being directly barred from an industry, firms are forced to obey governmentally imposed quotas of maximum output. Such car- tels invariably go hand in hand with a governmentally imposed program of minimum price control. When the government comes to realize that minimum price control by itself will lead to unsold surpluses and distress in the industry, it imposes quota restrictions on the output of producers. Not only does this action injure consumers by restricting production and lowering output; the output must also be produced by certain State-des- ignated producers. Regardless of how the quotas are arrived at, they are arbitrary; and as time passes, they more and more dis- tort the production structure that attempts to adjust to con- sumer demands. Efficient newcomers are prevented from serv- ing consumers, and inefficient firms are preserved because they are exempted by their old quotas from the necessity of meeting superior competition. Compulsory cartels furnish a haven in which the inefficient firms prosper at the expense of the effi- cient firms and of the consumers. B. L ICENSES Little attention has been paid to licenses; yet they constitute one of the most important (and steadily growing) monopolistic impositions in the current American economy. Licenses deliber- ately restrict the supply of labor and of firms in the licensed occupations. Various rules and requirements are imposed for work in the occupation or for entry into a certain line of busi- ness. Those who cannot qualify under the rules are prevented 48 Power and Market: Government and the Economy The Political Economy of Monopoly (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1952), pp. 249–329. 13 Subsidies, of course, penalize competitors not receiving the subsidy, and thus have a decided monopolistic impact.

Further, those who cannot meet the price of the license are barred from entry. Heavy license fees place great obstacles in the way of competitors with little initial capital. Some licenses such as those required in the liquor and taxicab businesses in some states impose an absolute limit on the num- ber of firms in the business. These licenses are negotiable, so that any new firm must buy from an older firm that wants to go out of business. Rigidity, inefficiency, and lack of adaptability to changing consumer desires are all evident in this arrangement. The market in license rights also demonstrates the burden that licenses place upon new entrants. Professor Machlup points out that the governmental administration of licensing is almost invariably in the hands of members of the trade, and he cogently likens the arrangements to the “self-governing” guilds of the Middle Ages. 14 Certificates of convenience and necessity are required of firms in industries—such as railroads, airlines, etc.—regulated by gov- ernmental commissions. These act as licenses but are generally far more difficult to obtain. This system excludes would-be entrants from a field, granting a monopolistic privilege to the firms remaining; furthermore, it subjects them to the detailed orders of the commission. Since these orders countermand those of the free market, they invariably result in imposed inef- ficiency and injury to the consumers. 15 Triangular Intervention 49 14 Ibid.

For the former license always confers a restrictionist price . Unions gain restrictionist wage rates by restricting the labor supply in an occupation. Here, once again, the same conditions prevail: other factors are forcibly excluded, and, since the monopolist does not own these excluded factors, he is not losing any revenue. Since a license always restricts entry into a field, it thereby always lowers supply and raises prices, or wage rates. The reason that a monopolistic grant to a business does not always raise prices, is that businesses can always expand or con- tract their production at will. Licensing of grocers does not nec- essarily reduce total supply, because it does not preclude the indefinite enlargement of the licensed grocery firms, which can take up the slack created by the exclusion of would-be competi- tors. But, aside from hours worked, restriction of entry into a labor market must always reduce the total supply of that labor. Hence, licenses or other monopolistic grants to businesses may or may not confer a monopoly price—depending on the elastic- ity of the demand curve; whereas licenses to laborers always confer a higher, restrictionist price on the licensees. C. S TANDARDS OF Q UALITY AND S AFETY One of the favorite arguments for licensing laws and other types of quality standards is that governments must “protect” consumers by insuring that workers and businesses sell goods and services of the highest quality. The answer, of course, is that “quality” is a highly elastic and relative term and is decided by the consumers in their free actions in the marketplace. The consumers decide according to their own tastes and interests, and particularly according to the price they wish to pay for the service. It may very well be, for example, that a certain number of years’ attendance at a certain type of school turns out the best quality of doctors (although it is difficult to see why the gov- ernment must guard the public from unlicensed cold-cream demonstrators or from plumbers without a college degree or 50 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"with less than ten years’ experience). But by prohibiting the practice of medicine by people who do not meet these require- ments, the government is injuring consumers who would buy the services of the outlawed competitors, is protecting “quali- fied” but less value-productive doctors from outside competi- tion, and also grants restrictionist prices to the remaining doc- tors. 16 Consumers are prevented from choosing lower-quality treatment of minor ills, in exchange for a lower price, and are also prevented from patronizing doctors who have a different theory of medicine from that sanctioned by the state-approved medical schools. How much these requirements are designed to “protect” the health of the public, and how much to restrict competition, may be gauged from the fact that giving medical advice free without a license is rarely a legal offense. Only the sale of medical advice requires a license. Since someone may be injured as much, if not more, by free medical advice than by purchased advice, the major purpose of the regulation is clearly to restrict competi- tion rather than to safeguard the public. 17 Other quality standards in production have an even more injurious effect. They impose governmental definitions of prod- ucts and require businesses to hew to the specifications laid down by these definitions. Thus, the government defines “bread” as being of a certain composition. This is supposed to be a safeguard against “adulteration,” but in fact it prohibits improvement . If the government defines a product in a certain Triangular Intervention 51 16 It is hardly remarkable that we hear continual complaints about a “shortage” of doctors and teachers, but rarely hear complaints of short- ages in unlicensed occupations. On licensing in medicine, see Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. 149–60; Reuben A. Kessel, “Price Discrimination in Medi- cine,” Journal of Law and Economics , October, 1958, pp. 20–53. 17 For an excellent analysis of the workings of compulsory quality standards in a concrete case, see P.T. Bauer, West African Trade (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1954), pp. 365–75."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"way, it prohibits change. A change, to be accepted by con- sumers, has to be an improvement, either absolutely or in the form of a lower price. Yet it may take a long time, if not forever, to persuade the government bureaucracy to change the require- ments. In the meantime, competition is injured, and technolog- ical improvements are blocked. 18 “Quality” standards, by shift- ing decisions about quality from the consumers to arbitrary government boards, impose rigidities and monopolization on the economic system. In the free economy, there would be ample means to obtain redress for direct injuries or fraudulent “adulteration.” No sys- tem of government “standards” or army of administrative inspectors is necessary. If a man is sold adulterated food, then clearly the seller has committed fraud, violating his contract to sell the food. Thus, if A sells B breakfast food, and it turns out to be straw, A has committed an illegal act of fraud by telling B he is selling him food, while actually selling straw. This is punish- able in the courts under “libertarian law,” i.e., the legal code of the free society that would prohibit all invasions of persons and property. The loss of the product and the price, plus suitable damages (paid to the victim , not to the State), would be included in the punishment of fraud. No administrator is needed to pre- vent nonfraudulent sales; if a man simply sells what he calls “bread,” it must meet the common definition of bread held by consumers, and not some arbitrary specification. However, if he specifies the composition on the loaf, he is liable for prosecution if he is lying. It must be emphasized that the crime is not lying per se , which is a moral problem not under the province of a free-market defense agency, but breaching a contract —taking someone else’s property under false pretenses and therefore being guilty of fraud. If, on the other hand, the adulterated product injures the health of the buyer (such as by an inserted 52 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 18 For case studies of the effects of such “quality” standards, see George J. Alexander, Honesty and Competition (Syracuse: Syracuse Uni- versity Press, 1967)."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"poison), the seller is further liable for prosecution for injuring and assaulting the person of the buyer. 19 Another type of quality control is the alleged “protection” of investors. SEC regulations force new companies selling stock, for example, to comply with certain rules, issue brochures, etc. The net effect is to hamper new and especially small firms and restrict them in acquiring capital, thereby conferring a monop- olistic privilege upon existing firms. Investors are prohibited from investing in particularly risky enterprises. SEC regula- tions, “blue-sky laws,” etc., thereby restrict the entry of new firms and prevent investment in risky but possibly successful ventures. Once again, efficiency in business and service to the consumer are hampered. 20 Safety codes are another common type of quality standard. They prescribe the details of production and outlaw differences. The free-market method of dealing, say, with the collapse of a building killing several persons, is to send the owner of the building to jail for manslaughter. But the free market can coun- tenance no arbitrary “safety” code promulgated in advance of any crime. The current system does not treat the building owner as a virtual murderer should a collapse occur; instead, he merely pays a sum of monetary damages. In that way, invasion of person goes relatively unpunished and undeterred. On the other hand, administrative codes proliferate, and their general effect is to prevent major improvements in the building industry and thus Triangular Intervention 53 19 On adulteration and fraud, see the definitive discussion by Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Law in a Free State (London: Macmillan & Co., 1895), pp. 132–58. 20 Some people who generally adhere to the free market support the SEC and similar regulations on the ground that they “raise the moral tone of competition.” Certainly they restrict competition, but they cannot be said to “raise the moral tone” until morality is successfully defined. How can morality in production be defined except as efficient service to the consumer? And how can anyone be “moral” if he is prevented by force from acting otherwise?"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"to confer monopolistic privileges on existing builders, as con- trasted with potentially innovating competitors. 21 Evasion of safety codes through bribery then permits the actual aggressor (the builder whose property injures someone) to continue unpunished and go scot free. It might be objected that free-market defense agencies must wait until after people are injured to punish , rather than prevent , crime. It is true that on the free market only overt acts can be punished. There is no attempt by anyone to tyrannize over any- one else on the ground that some future crime might possibly be prevented thereby. On the “prevention” theory, any sort of invasion of personal freedom can be, and in fact must be, justi- fied. It is certainly a ludicrous procedure to attempt to “pre- vent” a few future invasions by committing permanent inva- sions against everyone. 22 Safety regulations are also imposed on labor contracts. Workers and employers are prevented from agreeing on terms of hire unless certain governmental rules are obeyed. The result is a loss imposed on workers and employers, who are denied their freedom to contract, and who must turn to other, less remunerative employments. Factors are therefore distorted and misallocated in relation to both the maximum satisfaction of the consumers and maximum return to factors. Industry is rendered less productive and flexible. Another use of “safety regulations” is to prevent geographic competition, i.e., to keep consumers from buying goods from efficient producers located in other geographical areas. Analyt- ically, there is little distinction between competition in general 54 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 21 The building industry is so constituted that many laborers are quasi-independent entrepreneurs. Safety codes therefore compound the restrictionism of building unions. 22 We might add here that on the purely free market even the “clear and present danger” criterion would be far too lax and subjective a defi- nition for a punishable deed."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and in location, since location is simply one of the many advan- tages or disadvantages that competing firms possess. Thus, state governments have organized compulsory milk cartels, which set minimum prices and restrict output, and absolute embargoes are levied on out-of-state milk imports, under the guise of “safety.” The effect, of course, is to cut off competition and permit monopoly pricing. Furthermore, safety require- ments that go far beyond those imposed on local firms are often exacted on out-of-state products. 23 D. T ARIFFS Tariffs and various forms of import quotas prohibit, partially or totally, geographical competition for various products. Domestic firms are granted a quasi monopoly and, generally, a monopoly price. Tariffs injure the consumers within the “pro- tected” area, who are prevented from purchasing from more efficient competitors at a lower price. They also injure the more efficient foreign firms and the consumers of all areas, who are deprived of the advantages of geographic specialization. In a free market, the best resources will tend to be allocated to their most value-productive locations. Blocking interregional trade will force factors to obtain lower remuneration at less efficient and less value-productive tasks. Economists have devoted a great deal of attention to the “theory of international trade”—attention far beyond its ana- lytic importance. For, on the free market, there would be no separate theory of “international trade” at all—and the free market is the locus of the fundamental analytic problems. Analysis of interventionary situations consists simply in com- paring their effects to what would have occurred on the free market. “Nations” may be important politically and culturally, but economically they appear only as a consequence of govern- ment intervention, either in the form of tariffs or other barriers Triangular Intervention 55 23 See Stigler, Theory of Price, p. 211."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"to geographic trade, or as some form of monetary interven- tion. 24 Tariffs have inspired a profusion of economic speculation and argument. The arguments for tariffs have one thing in common: they all attempt to prove that the consumers of the protected area are not exploited by the tariff. These attempts are all in vain. There are many arguments. Typical are worries about the continuance of an “unfavorable balance of trade.” But every individual decides on his purchases and therefore deter- mines whether his balance should be “favorable” or “unfavor- able”; “unfavorable” is a misleading term because any purchase is the action most favorable for the individual at the time. The same is therefore true for the consolidated balance of a region or a country. There can be no “unfavorable” balance of trade from a region unless the traders so will it, either by selling their gold reserve, or by borrowing from others (the loans being vol- untarily granted by creditors). The absurdity of the protariff arguments can be seen when we carry the idea of a tariff to its logical conclusion—let us say, the case of two individuals, Jones and Smith. This is a valid use of the reductio ad absurdum because the same qualitative effects take place when a tariff is levied on a whole nation as when it is levied on one or two people; the difference is merely one of degree. 25 Suppose that Jones has a farm, “Jones’ Acres,” and Smith works for him. Having become steeped in protariff ideas, Jones exhorts Smith to “buy Jones’ Acres.” “Keep the money in Jones’ Acres,” “don’t be exploited by the flood of products from 56 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 24 See Henry George, Protection or Free Trade (New York: Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, 1946), pp. 37–44.

To make sure that their aim is accomplished, Jones levies a 1,000-percent tar- iff on the imports of all goods and services from “abroad,” i.e., from outside the farm. As a result, Jones and Smith see their leisure, or “problems of unemployment,” disappear as they work from dawn to dusk trying to eke out the production of all the goods they desire. Many they cannot raise at all; others they can, given centuries of effort. It is true that they reap the promise of the protectionists: “self-sufficiency,” although the “sufficiency” is bare subsistence instead of a comfortable standard of living. Money is “kept at home,” and they can pay each other very high nominal wages and prices, but the men find that the real value of their wages, in terms of goods, plummets drastically. Truly we are now back in the situation of the isolated or barter economies of Crusoe and Friday. And that is effectively what the tariff principle amounts to. This principle is an attack on the market, and its logical goal is the self-sufficiency of indi- vidual producers; it is a goal that, if realized, would spell poverty for all, and death for most, of the present world popu- lation. It would be a regression from civilization to barbarism. A mild tariff over a wider area is perhaps only a push in that direction, but it is a push, and the arguments used to justify the tariff apply equally well to a return to the “self-sufficiency” of the jungle. 26,27 Triangular Intervention 57 26 The tariff advocates will not wish to push the argument to this length, since all parties clearly lose so drastically. With a milder tariff, on the other hand, the tariff-protected “oligopolists” may gain more (in the short run) from exploiting the domestic consumers than they lose from being consumers themselves. 27 Our two-man example is similar to the illustration used in the keen critique of protection by Frederic Bastiat.

What is it that protection by tariff prevents? It is trade. . . . But trade, from which “protection” essays to preserve and defend us, is not, like flood, earthquake, or tor- nado, something that comes without human agency. Trade implies human action. There can be no need of preserving from or defending against trade, unless there are men who want to trade and try to trade. Who, then, are the men against whose efforts to trade “protection” preserves and defends us? . . . the desire of one party, however strong it may be, cannot of itself bring about trade. To every trade there must be two parties who actually desire to trade, and whose actions are reciprocal. No one can buy unless he finds someone willing to sell; and no one can sell unless there is some other one willing to buy. If Americans did not want to buy foreign goods, for- eign goods could not be sold here even if there were no tariff. The efficient cause of the trade which our tariff aims to prevent is the desire of Americans to buy foreign goods, not the desire of foreign produc- ers to sell them. . . . It is not from foreigners that protection preserves and defends us; it is from our- selves. 28 Ironically, the long-run exploitative possibilities of the pro- tective tariff are far less than those that arise from other forms of monopoly grant.

In the long run, therefore, a tariff per se does not establish a lasting benefit even for the immediate beneficiaries. Many writers and economists, otherwise in favor of free trade, have conceded the validity of the “infant industry argu- ment” for a protective tariff. Few free-traders, in fact, have chal- lenged the argument beyond warning that the tariff might be continued beyond the stage of “infancy” of the industry. This reply in effect concedes the validity of the “infant industry” argument. Aside from the utterly false and misleading biologi- cal analogy, which compares a newly established industry to a helpless new-born baby who needs protection, the substance of the argument has been stated by Taussig: The argument is that while the price of the protected article is temporarily raised by the duty, eventually it is lowered. Competition sets in . . . and brings a lower price in the end. . . . This reduction in domestic price comes only with the lapse of time. At the outset the domestic producer has difficulties, and cannot meet the foreign competition. In the end he learns how to produce to best advantage, and then can bring the article to market as cheaply as the foreigner, even more cheaply. 29 Thus, older competitors are alleged to possess historically acquired skill and capital that enable them to outcompete any new rivals. Wise protection of the government granted to the new firms, therefore, will, in the long run, promote rather than hinder competition. Triangular Intervention 59 29 F.W.

The fact that capital has already been sunk in older locations does, it is true, give the older firms an advantage, even if today, in the light of present knowledge and consumer wants, the investments would have been made in the new locations. But the point is that we must always work with a given situation, with the capital handed down to us by the investment of our ancestors. The fact that our ancestors made mistakes—from the point of view of our present superior knowledge—is unfortunate, but we must always do the best with what we have. We do not and never can begin investing from scratch; indeed, if we did, we should be in the situation of Robinson Crusoe, facing land again with our bare hands and no inherited equipment. Therefore, we must make use of the advantages given us by the sunk capital of the past. To subsidize new plants would be to injure consumers by depriving them of the advantages of historically given capital. In fact, if long-run prospects in the new industry are so promising, why does not private enterprise, ever on the lookout for a profitable investment opportunity, enter the new field? Only because entrepreneurs realize that such investment would be uneconomic, i.e., it would waste capital, land, and labor that could otherwise be invested to satisfy more urgent desires of the consumers. As Mises says: The truth is that the establishment of an infant indus- try is advantageous from the economic point of view only if the superiority of the new location is so momentous that it outweighs the disadvantages resulting from abandonment of nonconvertible and nontransferable capital goods invested in the older established plants. If this is the case, the new plants will be able to compete successfully with the old ones without any aid given by the government. If it is not the case, the protection granted to them is wasteful, even if it is only temporary and enables the new industry to hold its own at a later period. The tariff amounts virtually to a subsidy which the consumers 60 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"are forced to pay as a compensation for the employ- ment of scarce factors of production for the replace- ment of still utilizable capital goods to be scrapped and the withholding of these scarce factors from other employments in which they could render serv- ices valued higher by the consumers. . . . In the absence of tariffs the migration of industries [to bet- ter locations] is postponed until the capital goods invested in the old plants are worn out or become obsolete by technological improvements which are so momentous as to necessitate their replacement by new equipment. 30 Logically, the infant industry argument must be applied to interlocal and interregional trade as well as international. Fail- ure to realize this is one of the reasons for the persistence of the argument. Logically extended, in fact, the argument would have to imply that it is impossible for any new firm to exist and grow against the competition of older firms, wherever their locations. New firms, after all, have their own peculiar advantage to offset that of existing sunken capital possessed by the old firms. New firms can begin afresh with the latest and most productive equipment as well as on the best locations. The advantages and disadvantages of a new firm must be weighed against each other by entrepreneurs in each case, to discover the most profitable, and therefore the most serviceable, course. 31 E.

Immigration restrictions are an attempt to gain restrictionist wage rates for the inhabitants of an area. They constitute a restriction rather than monopoly because ( a ) in the labor force, each worker owns himself, and therefore the restrictionists have no control over the whole of the supply of labor; and ( b ) the supply of labor is large in relation to the pos- sible variability in the hours of an individual worker, i.e., a worker cannot, like a monopolist, take advantage of the restric- tion by increasing his output to take up the slack, and hence obtaining a higher price is not determined by the elasticity of the demand curve. A higher price is obtained in any case by the restriction of the supply of labor. There is a connexity through- out the entire labor market; labor markets are linked with each other in different occupations, and the general wage rate (in contrast to the rate in specific industries) is determined by the total supply of all labor, as compared with the various demand curves for different types of labor in different industries. A reduced total supply of labor in an area will thus tend to shift all the various supply curves for individual labor factors to the left, thus increasing wage rates all around. Immigration restrictions, therefore, may earn restrictionist wage rates for all people in the restricted area, although clearly the greatest relative gainers will be those who would have directly competed in the labor market with the potential immigrants. They gain at the expense of the excluded people, who are forced to accept lower-paying jobs at home. Obviously, not every geographic area will gain by immigra- tion restrictions—only a high-wage area. Those in relatively low-wage areas rarely have to worry about immigration: there the pressure is to emigrate. 32 The high-wage areas won their 62 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 32 Many States have imposed emigration restrictions upon their subjects.

Immigration barriers confer gains at the expense of foreign workers. Few residents of the area trouble themselves about that. 33 They raise other problems, however. The process of equalizing wage rates, though hobbled, will continue in the form of an export of capital investment to foreign, low-wage countries. Insistence on high wage rates at home creates more and more incentive for domestic capitalists to invest abroad. In the end, the equalization process will be effected anyway, except that the location of resources will be completely distorted. Too many workers and too much capital will be stationed abroad, and too little at home, in relation to the satisfaction of the world’s consumers. Secondly, the domestic citizens may very well lose more from immigration barriers as consumers than they gain as workers. For immigration barriers ( a ) impose shackles on the international division of labor, the most effi- cient location of production and population, etc., and ( b ) the population in the home country may well be below the “opti- mum” population for the home area. An inflow of population might well stimulate greater mass production and specializa- tion and thereby raise the real income per capita. In the long run, of course, the equalization would still take place, but per- haps at a higher level, especially if the poorer countries were “overpopulated” in comparison with their optimum. In other words, the high-wage country may have a population below the optimum real income per head, and the low-wage country may have excessive population over the optimum.

It is fashionable to speak of the “overpopulation” of some countries, such as China and India, and to assert that the Malthusian terrors of population pressing on the food supply are coming true in these areas. This is fallacious thinking, derived from focusing on “countries” instead of the world mar- ket as a whole. It is fallacious to say that there is overpopulation in some parts of the market and not in others. The theory of “over-” or “under-population (in relation to an arbitrary maxi- mum of real income per person) applies properly to the market as a whole. If parts of the market are “under-” and parts “over” populated, the problem stems, not from human reproduction or human industry, but from artificial governmental barriers to migration. India is “overpopulated” only because its citizens will not move abroad or because other governments will not admit them. If the former, then, the Indians are making a voluntary choice: to accept lower money wages in return for the great psy- chic gain of living in India. Wages are equalized internationally only if we incorporate such psychic factors into the wage rate. Moreover, if other governments forbid their entry, the problem is not absolute “overpopulation,” but coercive barriers thrown up against personal migration. 34 The loss to everyone as consumers from shackling the inter- regional division of labor and the efficient location of produc- tion, should not be overlooked in considering the effects of immigration barriers. The reductio ad absurdum , though not quite as devastating as in the case of the tariff, is also relevant here. As Cooley and Poirot point out: If it is sound to erect a barrier along our national boundary lines, against those who see greater oppor- tunities here than in their native land, why should we 64 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 34 Advocates of the “free market” who also advocate immigration bar- riers have rarely faced the implications of their position.

Implicitly, he believes that his geographic area now exceeds its optimum population point. What he really fears, therefore, is not so much immigration as any population growth.

Child labor laws, then, amount to compulsory unem- ployment. Compulsory unemployment, of course, reduces the general supply of labor and raises wage rates restrictively as the connexity of the labor market diffuses the effects throughout the market. Not only is the child prevented from laboring, but the income of families with children is arbitrarily lowered by the government, and childless families gain at the expense of families with children. Child labor laws penalize families with children because the period of time in which children remain net monetary liabilities to their parents is thereby prolonged. Child labor laws, by restricting the supply of labor, lower the production of the economy and hence tend to reduce the stan- dard of living of everyone in the society. Furthermore, the laws do not even have the beneficial effect that compulsory birth control might have in reducing population, when it is above the optimum point. For the total population is not reduced (except from the indirect effects of the penalty on children), but the working population is. To reduce the working population while the consuming population remains undiminished is to lower the general standard of living. Child labor laws may take the form of outright prohibition or of requiring “working papers” and all sorts of red tape before a youngster can be hired, thus partially achieving the same effect. The child labor laws are also bolstered by compulsory school attendance laws. Compelling a child to remain in a State or State-certified school until a certain age has the same effect of prohibiting his employment and preserving adult workers from younger competition. Compulsory attendance, however, goes even further in compelling a child to absorb a certain service— schooling—when he or his parents would prefer otherwise, thus imposing a further loss of utility upon these children. 36,37 66 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 36 For a brilliant discussion of the anti-child-labor Factory Acts in early nineteenth-century Britain, see Hutt, “The Factory System.” On the merits of child labor, see also D.C.

C ONSCRIPTION It has rarely been realized that conscription is an effective means of granting a monopolistic privilege and imposing restrictionist wage rates. Conscription, like child labor laws, removes a part of the labor force from competition in the labor market—in this case, the removal of healthy, adult members. Coerced removal and compulsory labor in the armed forces at only nominal pay increases the wage rates of those remaining, especially in those fields most directly competitive with the jobs of the drafted men. Of course, the general productivity of the economy also decreases, offsetting the increases for at least some of the workers. But, as in other cases of monopoly grants, some of the privileged will probably gain from the governmen- tal action. Directly, conscription is a method by which the gov- ernment can commandeer labor at far less than market wage rates—the rate it would have to pay to induce the enlistment of a volunteer army. 38 Triangular Intervention 67 Economy of the Seventeenth Century,” The Economic History Review , April, 1956, p. 286. 37 A news item illustrates the connection between child labor laws and restrictionist wage rates for adults—particularly for unions: Through the co-operation of some 26,000 grocers, plus trade unions, thousands of teenage boys will get a chance to earn summer spending money, Deputy Police Commis- sion James B.

M INIMUM W AGE L AWS AND C OMPULSORY U NIONISM Compulsory unemployment is achieved indirectly through minimum wage laws. On the free market, everyone’s wage tends to be set at his discounted marginal value productivity. A mini- mum wage law means that those whose DMVP is below the legal minimum are prevented from working. The worker was will- ing to take the job, and the employer to hire him. But the decree of the State prevents this hiring from taking place. Compulsory unemployment thus removes the competition of marginal work- ers and raises the wage rates of the other workers remaining. Thus, while the announced aim of a minimum wage law is to improve the incomes of the marginal workers, the actual effect is precisely the reverse—it is to render them unemployable at legal wage rates. The higher the minimum wage rate relative to free-market rates, the greater the resulting unemployment. 39 Unions aim for restrictionist wage rates, which on a partial scale cause distortions in production, lower wage rates for non- members, and pockets of unemployment, and on a general scale lead to greater distortions and permanent mass unemployment. By enforcing restrictive production rules, rather than allowing individual workers voluntarily to accept work rules laid down by the enterpriser in the use of his property, unions reduce general productivity and hence the living standards of the economy. Any governmental encouragement of unions, therefore, such as is imposed under the Wagner-Taft-Hartley Act, leads to a regime of restrictive wage rates, injury to production, and gen- eral unemployment. The indirect effect on employment is sim- ilar to that of a minimum wage law, except that fewer workers are affected, and it is then the union-enforced minimum wage that is being imposed. 68 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 39 On minimum wage laws, see Yale Brozen and Milton Friedman, The Minimum Wage: Who Pays?

S UBSIDIES TO U NEMPLOYMENT Government unemployment benefits are an important means of subsidizing unemployment caused by unions or minimum wage laws. When restrictive wage rates lead to unemployment, the government steps in to prevent the unemployed workers from injuring union solidarity and union-enforced wage rates.

An important example is regulation of insur- ance companies, particularly those selling life insurance. Insur- ance is a speculative enterprise, as is any other, but based on the relatively greater certainty of biological mortality. All that is necessary for life insurance is for premiums to be currently levied in sufficient amount to pay benefits to the actuarially expected beneficiaries. Yet life insurance companies have, pecu- liarly, launched into the investment business, by contending that they need to build up a net reserve so large as to be almost sufficient to pay all benefits if half the population died immedi- ately. They are able to accumulate such reserves by charging premiums far higher than would be needed for mere insurance protection. Furthermore, by charging constant premiums over the years they are able to phase out their own risks and place them on the shoulders of their unwitting policyholders (through the accumulating cash surrender values of their poli- cies). Moreover, the companies, not the policyholders, keep the returns on the invested reserves. The insurance companies have been able to charge and collect the absurdly high premiums required by such a policy because state governments have out- lawed , in the name of consumer protection, any possible com- petition from the low rates of nonreserve insurance companies. As a result, existing half-insurance, half-uneconomic “invest- ment” companies have been granted special privilege by the government. 70 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 40 The withholding tax is an example of a “wartime” measure that now appears to be an indestructible part of our tax system; it compels busi nesses to be tax collectors for the government without pay.

A NTITRUST L AWS It may seem strange to the reader that one of the most impor- tant governmental checks on efficient competition, and there- fore grants of quasi monopolies, are the antitrust laws. Very few, whether economists or others, have questioned the principle of the antitrust laws, particularly now that they have been on the statute books for some years. As is true of many other measures, evaluation of the antitrust laws has not proceeded from an analysis of their nature or of their necessary consequences, but from an impressionistic reaction to their announced aims. The chief criticism of these laws is that “they haven’t gone far enough.” Some of those most ardent in the proclamation of their belief in the “free market” have been most clamorous in calling for stringent antitrust laws and the “breakup of monop- olies.” Even the most “right-wing” economists have only gin- gerly criticized certain antitrust procedures, without daring to attack the principle of the laws per se. The only viable definition of monopoly is a grant of privilege from the government. 41 It therefore becomes quite clear that it is impossible for the government to decrease monopoly by pass- ing punitive laws. The only way for the government to decrease monopoly, if that is the desideratum, is to remove its own monopoly grants. The antitrust laws, therefore, do not in the least “diminish monopoly.” What they do accomplish is to impose a continual, capricious harassment of efficient business enterprise. The law in the United States is couched in vague, indefinable terms, permitting the Administration and the courts to omit defining in advance what is a “monopolistic” crime and what is not. Whereas Anglo-Saxon law has rested on a structure of clear definitions of crime, known in advance and discoverable by a jury after due legal process, the antitrust laws thrive on deliberate vagueness and ex post facto rulings. No businessman Triangular Intervention 71 41 For further elaboration, see Man, Economy, and State, chapter 10."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"knows when he has committed a crime and when he has not, and he will never know until the government, perhaps after another shift in its own criteria of crime, swoops down upon him and prosecutes. The effects of these arbitrary rules and ex post facto findings of “crime” are manifold: business initiative is hampered; businessmen are fearful and subservient to the arbi- trary rulings of government officials; and business is not per- mitted to be efficient in serving the consumer. Since business always tends to adopt those practices and that scale of activity which maximize profits and income and serve the consumers best, any harassment of business practice by government can only hamper business efficiency and reward inefficiency. 42 It is vain, however, to call simply for clearer statutory defini- tions of monopolistic practice. For the vagueness of the law results from the impossibility of laying down a cogent definition of monopoly on the market. Hence the chaotic shift of the gov- ernment from one unjustifiable criterion of monopoly to another: size of firm, “closeness” of substitutes, charging a price “too high” or “too low” or the same as a competitor, merging that “substantially lessens competition,” etc. All these criteria are meaningless. An example is the criterion of substantially less- ening competition . This implicitly assumes that “competition” is some sort of quantity . But it is not; it is a process, whereby indi- viduals and firms supply goods on the market without using force. 43 To preserve “competition” does not mean to dictate arbitrarily that a certain number of firms of a certain size have to exist in an industry or area; it means to see to it that men are free to compete (or not) unrestrained by the use of force. The original Sherman Act stressed “collusion” in “restraint of trade.” Here again, there is nothing anticompetitive per se 72 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 42 See John W.

If “collusion” must be stopped, and cartels must be broken up by the government, i.e., if to maintain com- petition it is necessary that co-operation be destroyed, then the “anti-monopolists” must advocate the complete prohibition of all corporations and partnerships. Only individually owned firms would then be tolerated. Aside from the fact that this compulsory competition and outlawed co-operation is hardly compatible with the “free market” that many antitrusters pro- fess to advocate, the inefficiency and lower productivity stem- ming from the outlawing of pooled capital would send the economy a good part of the way from civilization to barbarism. An individual becoming idle instead of working may be said to “restrain” trade, although he is simply not engaging in it rather than “restraining” it. If antitrusters wish to prevent idle- ness, which is the logical extension of the W.H. Hutt concept of consumers’ sovereignty, then they would have to pass a law compelling labor and outlawing leisure—a condition certainly close to slavery. 44 But if we confine the definition of “restraint” to restraining the trade of others , then clearly there can be no restraint of trade at all on the free market—and only the gov- ernment (or some other institution using violence) can restrain trade. And one conspicuous form of such restraint is antitrust legisla- tion itself! One of the few cogent discussions of the antitrust principle in recent years has been that of Isabel Paterson.

Government is monopoly; and all it can do is to impose restrictions which may issue in monopoly, when they go so far as to require permis- sion for the individual to engage in production. This is the essence of the Society-of-Status. The reversion to status law in the antitrust legislation went unno- ticed . . . the politicians . . . had secured a law under which it was impossible for the citizen to know beforehand what constituted a crime, and which therefore made all productive effort liable to prose- cution if not to certain conviction. 46 In the earlier days of the “trust problem,” Paul de Rousiers commented: Directly the formation of Trusts is not induced by the natural action of economic forces; as soon as they depend on artificial protection (such as tariffs), the most effective method of attack is to simply reduce the number and force of these protective accidents to 74 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 45 Isabel Paterson, The God of the Machine (New York: G.P.

O UTLAWING B ASING -P OINT P RICING An important example of the monopolizing effects of a pro- gram supposedly designed to combat monopoly is the court deci- sion outlawing basing-point pricing. On the free market, price uniformity means uniformity at each consuming center, and not uniformity at each mill. In commodities where freight costs are a large proportion of final price, this distinction becomes important, and many firms adopt such price uniformity, enabling firms further away from a consuming center to “absorb” some freight charges in order to compete with local firms. One of the forms of freight absorption is called “basing- point pricing.” Ruling this practice “monopolistic” and virtually decreeing that every firm must charge uniform prices “at the mill” not only prevents interlocational competition in such industries, but confers an artificial monopolistic privilege on local firms. Each local firm is granted the area of its own loca- tion, with a haven set by the freight costs of out-of-town rivals, within which it can charge its customers a monopoly price.

Further- more, the decreasing-cost advantages of a large-scale market and large-scale production are eliminated, as each firm is con- fined to a small compass.

C ONSERVATION L AWS Conservation laws restrict the use of depleting resources and force owners to invest in the maintenance of replaceable “natu- ral” resources. The effect of both cases is similar: the restriction of present production for the supposed benefit of future pro- duction. This is obvious in the case of depleting resources; fac- tors are also compelled to maintain replaceable resources (such as trees) when they could have more profitably engaged in other forms of production. In the latter case there is a double distor- tion: factors are forcibly shifted to future production, and they are also forced into a certain type of future production—the replacement of these particular resources. 50 76 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 48 See United States Steel Corporation, T.N.E.C.

People’s voluntary allocations made according to their time preferences are forcibly altered, and relatively more investment is forced into production for future consumption. In short, the State decides that the present generation must be made to allocate its resources more to the future than it wishes to do; for this service the State is held up as being “farseeing,” compared to “shortsighted” free individuals. But, presumably, depleting resources must be used at some time, and some bal- ance must always be struck between present and future produc- tion. Why does the claim of the present generation weigh so lightly in the scales? Why is the future generation so much more worthy that it can compel the present to carry a greater load? What did the future ever do to deserve privileged treat- ment? 51 Indeed, since the future is likely to be wealthier than the present, the reverse might well apply! The same reasoning applies to all attempts to change the market’s time-preference ratio. Why should the future be able to enforce greater sacri- fices on the present than the present is willing to undergo? Fur- thermore, after a span of years, the future will become the pres- ent; must the future generations then also be restricted in their production and consumption because of another wraithlike “future”?

Yet this is the goal of conservation laws. Conservation laws are truly “pie-in-the-sky” legislation. 52 Individuals in the market decide on the time structure in their allocation of factors in accordance with the estimated rev- enue that their resources will bring in present as against future use. In other words, they will tend to maximize the present value, at any time, of their land and capital assets. 53 The time structure of rental income from assets is determined by the interest rate, which in turn is determined by the time-prefer- ence schedules of all individuals on the market. Time prefer- ence, in addition to the specific estimated demands for each good, will determine the allocations of factors to each use. Since a lower time preference will connote more investment in future consumers’ goods, it will also mean more “conservation” of nat- ural resources. A high time preference will lead to less invest- ment and more consumption in the present, and consequently to less “conservation.” 54 78 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 52 As Scott aptly asks: Why agree “to preserve resources as they would be in the absence of their human users?” Scott, “Conservation Policy,” p. 513. And further: “Most of [our] progress has taken the form of con- verting natural resources into more desirable forms of wealth. If man had prized natural resources above his own product, he would doubtless have remained savage, practicing ‘conservatism.’ ” Scott, Natural Resources , p. 11. If the logic of tariffs is to destroy the market, then the logic of con- servation laws is to destroy all human production and consumption. 53 Strictly, investors will attempt to maximize their “internal rates of return,” but maximizing the present value is close enough for our purposes.

Pearce, “A New Approach to the The- ory of the Firm,” Oxford Economic Papers, October, 1952, pp. 252–65. 54 In some cases, however, lower time preferences and greater invest- ment activity will deplete natural resources at a more rapid rate, if there is a particularly great demand for their use in the new activity.

Many assume that entrepreneurs have no fore- sight and would blithely use natural resources only to find themselves some day suddenly without any property. Only the wise, providential State can foresee depletion. The absurdity of this argument is evident when we realize that the present value of the entrepreneur’s land is dependent on the expected future rents from his resources. Even if the entrepreneur himself should be unaccountably ignorant, the market will not be, and its valuation (i.e., the valuation of interested experts with money at stake) will tend to reflect its value accurately. In fact, it is the entrepreneur’s business to forecast, and he is rewarded for cor- rect forecasting by profits. Will entrepreneurs on the market have less foresight than bureaucrats comfortably ensconced in their seizure of the taxpayers’ money? 55 Another error made by the conservationists is to assume a technology fixed for all time. Human beings use what resources they have; and as technological knowledge grows, the types of usable resources multiply. If we have less timber to use than past generations, we need less too, for we have found other materi- als that can be used for construction or fuel.

Forced “con- servation” investment on this submarginal land or government subsidiza- tion of the “Okies” would have aggravated a dislocation that the market quickly eliminated. Much American soil erosion, furthermore, has stemmed from failure to preserve full private property rights in land.

Yet it is clear that American land has had more value-productive uses than timber production, and hence the land was diverted to those ends that better satisfied consumer wants. 56 What standards can the critics set up instead? If they think too much forest has been cut down, how can they arrive at a quantitative standard to determine how much is “too much”? In fact, it is impossible to arrive at any such standard, just as it is impossible to arrive at any quantitative standards for market action outside the market. Any attempt to do so must be arbitrary and unsupported by any rational principle. America has been the prime home of conservation laws, particularly on behalf of its “public domain.” Under a purely free-enterprise system, there would be no such thing as a gov- ernmentally owned public domain. Land would simply remain unowned until it first came into use, after which it would be owned by the first user and his heirs or assigns. 57 80 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 56 A typical conservationist complainer was J.D. Brown who, in 1832, worried over the consumption of timber: “Whence shall we procure supplies of timber fifty years hence for the continuance of our navy?” Quoted in Scott, National Resources , p. 37. Scott also notes that the critics never seemed to realize that a nation’s timber can be purchased from abroad. Scott, “Conservation Policy.” 57 This system was dimly adumbrated by the Homestead Law of 1862. However, this law imposed an arbitrary and pointless maximum on the size of farm that could be staked out by the first user. This limitation had the result of nullifying the law further West, where the minimum acreage needed for cattle or sheep grazing was far larger than the antiquated legal maximum would allow. Furthermore, the maximum limitation and the requirement that the land be used for farming led to the very “ravaging” of the forests that conservationists now deplore, for it hobbled private ownership of large forest tracts."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The consequences of government ownership of the public domain will be further explored below. Here we may state a few of them. When the government owns the land and permits pri- vate individuals to use it freely, the result is indeed a wasteful overexploitation of the resource. More factors are employed to use up the resource than on a free market, since the only gains to the users are immediate; and if they wait, other users will deplete the limited resource. Free use of a governmentally owned resource truly inaugurates a “war of all against all,” as more and more users, eager for the free bargain, attempt to exploit the scarce resource. To have a scarce resource and to make everyone believe (because of the free gift of use) that its supply is unlimited, causes overuse of the resource, favoritism, figurative queuing up, etc. A striking example was the Western grazing lands in the lat- ter half of the nineteenth century. The government prevented cattlemen from owning the land and fencing it in, and insisted it be kept as “open range” owned by the government. The result was excessive use of the range and its untimely depletion. 58 Another example is the rapid depletion of the fisheries. Since no one is permitted to own any segment of the sea, no one sees any sense in preserving the value of the resource, as each is benefited only by rapid use, in advance of his competitors. 59 Triangular Intervention 81 58 See E. Louise Peffer, The Closing of the Public Domain (Stanford: Stan- ford University Press, 1951), pp. 25–27.

Hays, Conser- vation and the Gospel of Efficiency (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959), pp. 50–51. The government’s failure to extend the homestead prin- ciple to the larger areas had another important social effect: it led to con- stant squabbles between the users—the cattlemen and the other home- steaders who came later and demanded their “just share” of the free land. 59 For an illuminating discussion of private property rights in fisheries, see Gordon Tullock, The Fisheries (Columbia: University of South Car- olina Bureau of Business and Economic Research, February, 1962).

If the govern- ment owns the land and leases it to grazers or timber users, once again there is no incentive for the lessee to preserve the value of the resource, since he does not own it. It is to his best interest as a lessee to use the resource as intensively as possible in the pres- ent . Hence, leasing also depletes natural resources excessively. In contrast, if private individuals were to own all the lands and resources, then it would be to the owners’ interest to max- imize the present value of each resource. Excessive depletion of the resource would lower its capital value on the market. Against the preservation of the capital value of the resource as a whole, the resource owner balances the income to be presently obtained from its use. The balance is decided, ceteris paribus , by the time preference and the other preferences of the market. 60 If private individuals can only use but not own the land, the bal- ance is destroyed, and the government has provided an impetus to excessive present use. Not only is the announced aim of conservation laws—to aid the future at the expense of the present—illegitimate, and the arguments in favor of it invalid, but compulsory conservation would not achieve even this goal. For the future is already pro- vided for through present saving and investment. Conservation laws will indeed coerce greater investment in natural resources: using other resources to maintain renewable resources and forc- ing a greater inventory of stock in depletable resources. But total investment is determined by the time preferences of individuals, and these will not have changed. Conservation laws, then, do not really increase total provisions for the future; they merely shift investment from capital goods, buildings, etc., to natural 82 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 60 High demand for the product increases the value of the resource, and thereby stimulates its preservation, investment in it, and exploration for it.

They thereby impose an inefficient and distorted investment pattern on the economy. 61 Given the nature and consequences of conservation laws, why should anyone advocate this legislation? Conservation laws, we must note, have a very “practical” aspect. They restrict produc- tion, i.e., the use of a resource, by force and thereby create a monopolistic privilege, which leads to a restrictionist price to owners of this resource or of substitutes for it. Conservation laws can be more effective monopolizers than tariffs because, as we have seen, tariffs permit new entry and unlimited production by domestic competitors. 62 Conservation laws, on the other hand, serve to cartelize a land factor and absolutely restrict production, thereby helping to insure permanent (and continuing) monopoly gains for the owners. These monopoly gains, of course, will tend to be capitalized into an increase in the capital value of the land. The person who later buys the monopolized factor, then, will simply earn the going rate of interest on his investment, even though the monopoly gain will be included in his earnings. Conservation laws, therefore, must also be looked upon as grants of monopolistic privilege. One outstanding example is the American government’s policy, since the end of the nine- teenth century, of “reserving” vast tracts of the “public domain”—i.e., the government’s land holdings. 63 Reserving means that the government keeps land under its ownership and abandons its earlier policy of keeping the domain open for homesteading by private owners. Forests, in particular, have been reserved, ostensibly for the purpose of conservation. What is the effect of withholding huge tracts of timberland from pro- duction? It is to confer a monopolistic privilege, and therefore Triangular Intervention 83 61 See ibid ., pp. 21–22. 62 There is another similarity between tariffs and conservation laws: both aim at national self-sufficiency, and both try to foster national or local industries by coercive intervention in the free market. 63 For an analysis of government land ownership and government ownership in general, see below."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"a restrictionist price , on competing private lands and on compet- ing timber. We have seen that limiting the labor supply confers a restric- tionist wage on the privileged workers (while the workers pushed out by union wage rates or by licenses or immigration laws must find lower-paying and less value-productive jobs else- where). A monopoly or quasi-monopoly privilege for the pro- duction of capital or consumer goods, on the other hand, may or may not confer a monopoly price, depending on the config- uration of the demand curves for the individual firms, as well as their costs. Since a firm can contract or expand its supply at will, it sets its supply with the knowledge that lowering output to achieve a monopoly price must also lower the total amount of goods sold. 64 The laborer need bother with no such considera- tion (aside from a negligible variation in demands for each laborer’s total hours of service). What about the privileged landowner? Will he achieve a definite restrictionist, or a possi- ble monopoly, price? A prime characteristic of a piece of land is that it cannot be increased by labor; if it is augmentable, then it is a capital good, not land. The same, in fact, applies to labor, which, in all but long periods of time, can be regarded as fixed in its total supply. Since labor in its totality cannot be increased (except, as we have noted, in regard to hours of work per day), government restriction on the labor supply—child labor laws, immigration barriers, etc.—therefore confers a restrictionist wage increase on the workers remaining. Capital or consumer goods can be increased or decreased, so that privileged firms must take their demand curves into account. Land, on the other hand, cannot be increased; restriction of the supply of land, therefore, also confers a restrictionist price of land above 84 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 64 On the free market, the demand curve for each firm in equilibrium must be elastic above the equilibrium price; otherwise the firm would reduce output.

If the government forces land or natural resources out of the market, therefore, it inevitably lowers the supply available on the market and just as inevitably confers a monopoly gain and a restrictionist price on the remaining landowners or resource owners. In addition to all of their other effects, conservation laws force labor to abandon good lands and, instead, cultivate the remaining submarginal land. This coerced shift lowers the marginal productivity of labor and consequently reduces the general standard of living. Let us return to the government’s policy of reserving timber lands. This confers a restrictionist price and a monopoly gain on the lands remaining in use. Land markets are specific and do not have the same general connexity as labor markets. There- fore, the restrictionist price rise is confined far more to lands that directly competed, or would compete, with the withdrawn or “reserved” lands. In the case of American conservation pol- icy, the particular beneficiaries were ( a ) the land-grant Western railroads and ( b ) the existing timber-owners.

Gaffney concludes: “Following this advice, many state and local governments avoid returning tax-reverted lands to use.” Mason Gaffney, “Vituperation Well Answered,” Land and Liberty , December, 1952, p. 126; reprinted in Spencer Heath, Progress and Poverty Reviewed (2nd ed.; New York: The Freeman, 1953)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"they later sold this land to new inhabitants of the area. The rail- roads thus received another gift from the government—this time in the form of a monopoly gain, at the expense of the con- sumers. The railroads were not ignorant of the monopolistic advan- tages that would be conferred upon them by conservation laws; in fact, the railroads were the financial “angel” of the entire conservation movement. Thus, Peffer writes: There was a definite basis for the charge that the rail- roads were interested in a repeal of [various laws per- mitting easy transfer of the public domain to the hands of private settlers]. The National Irrigation Association, which was the most vigorous advocate of land law reform outside of the Administration, was financed in part by the transcontinental railroads and by the Burlington and the Rock Island railroads, to the amount of $39,000 a year, out of a total budget of around $50,000. The program of this association and the railroads, as announced by James J. Hill [a pre- eminent railroad magnate] was almost more advanced than that of [the leading conservationists]. 66 The timber owners also understood the gains they would acquire from forest “conservation.” President Theodore Roo- sevelt himself announced that “the great users of timber are themselves forwarding the movement for forest preservation.” As one student of the problem declared, the lumber manufacturers and timber owners . . . had arrived at a harmonious understanding with Gifford Pinchot [the leader in forest conservation] as early as 86 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 66 Peffer, Closing of the Public Domain , p. 54.

In other words, the government by with- drawing timber lands from entry and keeping them off the market would aid in appreciating the value of privately owned timber. 67 N. P ATENTS 68 A patent is a grant of monopoly privilege by the government to first discoverers of certain types of inventions. 69 Some defenders of patents assert that they are not monopoly privi- leges but simply property rights in inventions, or even in “ideas.” But in free-market, or libertarian, law everyone’s right to property is defended without a patent. If someone has an idea or plan and produces an invention, which is then stolen from his house, the stealing is an act of theft illegal under general law. On the other hand, patents actually invade the property rights of those independent discoverers of an idea or an invention who happen to make the discovery after the patentee. These later inventors and innovators are prevented by force from employ- ing their own ideas and their own property. Furthermore, in a free society the innovator could market his invention and stamp it “copyright,” thereby preventing buyers from reselling the same or a duplicate product. Patents, therefore, invade rather than defend property rights. The speciousness of the argument that patents protect property rights in ideas is demonstrated by the fact that not all, Triangular Intervention 87 67 J.H. Cox, “Organization of the Lumber Industry in the Pacific Northwest, 1889–1914” (Ph.D. diss., University of California, 1937), pp. 174–77; cited in Peffer, Closing of the Public Domain, p. 57.

Numerous new ideas are never treated as subject to patent grants. Another common argument for patents is that “society” sim- ply makes a contract with the inventor to purchase his secret, so that “society” will have use of it. But in the first place, “society” could then pay a straight subsidy, or price, to the inventor; it does not have to prevent all later inventors from marketing their inventions in this field. Secondly, there is nothing in the free economy to prevent any individual or group of individuals from purchasing secret inventions from their creators. No monopo- listic patent is therefore necessary. The most popular argument for patents among economists is the utilitarian one that a patent for a certain number of years is necessary to encourage a sufficient amount of research expen- diture toward inventions and innovations in new processes and products. This is a curious argument, because the question immediately arises: By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are “too much,” “too little,” or just about enough? Resources in society are limited, and they may be used for countless alterna- tive ends. By what standards does one determine that certain uses are “excessive,” that certain uses are “insufficient,” etc.? Someone observes that there is little investment in Arizona but a great deal in Pennsylvania; he indignantly asserts that Arizona deserves “more investment.” But what standards can he use to justify such a statement? The market does have a rational stan- dard: the highest money incomes and highest profits, for these may be achieved only through maximum ser vice to the con- sumers. This principle of maximum service to consumers and producers alike (i.e., to everybody) governs the seemingly mys- terious market allocation of resources: how much to devote to one firm or another, to one area or another, to the present or the future, to one good or another, to research rather than other forms of investment. The observer who criticizes this allocation can have no rational standards for decision; he has 88 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"only his arbitrary whim. This is particularly true of criticism of production relations in contrast to interference with consump- tion. Someone who chides consumers for buying too many cos- metics may have, rightly or wrongly, some rational basis for his criticism. But someone who thinks that more or less of a cer- tain resource should be used in a certain manner, or that busi- ness firms are “too large” or “too small,” or that too much or too little is spent on research or is invested in a new machine, can have no rational basis for his criticism. Businesses, in short, are producing for a market, guided by the valuations of con- sumers on that market. Outside observers may criticize the ultimate valuations of consumers if they choose—although if they interfere with consumption based on these valuations, they impose a loss of utility upon the consumers—but they cannot legitimately criticize the means , the allocations of fac- tors, by which these ends are served. Capital funds are limited, as are all other resources, and they must be allocated to various uses, one of which is research expenditures. On the market, rational decisions are made with regard to setting research expenditures, in accordance with the best entrepreneurial expectations of future returns. To subsidize research expenditures by coercion would restrict the satisfaction of consumers and producers on the market. Many advocates of patents believe that the ordinary com- petitive processes of the market do not sufficiently encourage the adoption of new processes, and that therefore innovations must be coercively promoted by the government. But the mar- ket decides on the rate of introduction of new processes just as it decides on the rate of industrialization of a new geographic area. In fact, this argument for patents is very similar to the “infant industry” argument for tariffs—that market procedures are not sufficient to permit the introduction of worthy new processes. And again the answer is the same: that people must balance the superior productivity of the new processes against the cost of installing them, i.e., against the advantage possessed by the old process in being already in existence. Conferring Triangular Intervention 89"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"special coercive privileges upon innovation would needlessly scrap valuable plants already in existence and impose an exces- sive burden upon consumers. Nor is it by any means self-evident even that patents encour- age an increase in the absolute quantity of research expendi- tures. But certainly we can say that patents distort the allocation of factors on the type of research being conducted. For while it is true that the first discoverer benefits from the privilege, it is also true that his competitors are excluded from production in the area of the patent for many years. And since a later patent can build on an earlier, related one in the same field, competi- tors can often be discouraged indefinitely from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent. More- over, the patentee himself is discouraged from engaging in fur- ther research in this field, for the privilege permits him to rest on his laurels for the entire period of the patent, with the assur- ance that no competitor can trespass on his domain. The com- petitive spur to further research is eliminated. Research expen- ditures, therefore, are overstimulated in the early stages before anyone has a patent and unduly restricted in the period after the patent is received. In addition, some inventions are considered patentable, while others are not. The patent system thus has the further effect of artificially stimulating research expenditures in the patentable areas, while artificially restricting research in the nonpatentable areas. As Arnold Plant summed up the problem of competitive research expenditures and innovations: Neither can it be assumed that inventors would cease to be employed if entrepreneurs lost the monopoly over the use of their inventions. Busi- nesses employ them today for the production of nonpatentable inventions, and they do not do so merely for the profit which priority secures. In active competition . . . no business can afford to lag behind its competitors. The reputation of a firm depends upon its ability to keep ahead, to be first in 90 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the market with new improvements in its products and new reductions in their prices. 70 Finally, of course, the market itself provides an easy and effective course for those who feel that there are not enough expenditures being made in certain directions on the free mar- ket. They are free to make these expenditures themselves. Those who would like to see more inventions made and exploited are at lib- erty to join together and subsidize such efforts in any way they think best. In doing so, they would, as consumers, add resources to the research and invention business. And they would not then be forcing other consumers to lose utility by conferring monopoly grants and distorting the allocation of the market. Their voluntary expenditures would become part of the market and help to express its ultimate consumer valuations. Further- more, later inventors would not be restricted. The friends of invention could accomplish their aims without calling in the State and imposing losses on the mass of consumers. Patents, like any monopoly grant, confer a privilege on one and restrict the entry of others, thereby distorting the freely competitive pattern of industry. If the product is sufficiently demanded by the public, the patentee will be able to achieve a monopoly price. Patentees, instead of marketing their invention themselves, may elect either to (1) sell their privilege to another or (2) keep the patent privilege but sell licenses to other firms, permitting them to market the invention. The patent privilege thereby becomes a capitalized monopoly gain. It will tend to sell at the price that capitalizes the expected future monopoly gain to be derived from it. Licensing is equivalent to renting capital, and a license will tend to sell at a price equal to the discounted sum of the rental income that the patent will earn for the period of the license. A system of general licensing is equivalent to a tax on the use of the new process, except that the patentee receives the Triangular Intervention 91 70 Arnold Plant, “The Economic Theory concerning Patents for Inventions,” Economica , February, 1934, p. 44."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"tax instead of the government. This tax restricts production in comparison with the free market, thereby raising the price of the product and reducing the consumer’s standard of living. It also distorts the allocation of resources, keeping factors out of these processes and forcing them to enter less value-productive fields. Most current critics of patents direct their fire not at the patents themselves, but at alleged “monopolistic abuses” in their use. They fail to realize that the patent itself is the monop- oly and that, when someone is granted a monopoly privilege, it should occasion neither surprise nor indignation when he makes full use of it. O. F RANCHISES AND “P UBLIC U TILITIES ” Franchises are generally grants of permission by the govern- ment for the use of its streets. Where the franchises are exclusive or restrictive, they are grants of monopoly or quasi-monopoly privilege. Where they are general and not exclusive, however, they cannot be called monopolistic. For the franchise question is complicated by the fact that the government owns the streets and therefore must give permission before anyone uses them. In a truly free market, of course, streets would be privately, not governmentally, owned, and the problem of franchises would not arise. The fact that the government must give permission for the use of its streets has been cited to justify stringent government regulations of “public utilities,” many of which (like water or electric companies) must make use of the streets. The regula- tions are then treated as a voluntary quid pro quo . But to do so overlooks the fact that governmental ownership of the streets is itself a permanent act of intervention. Regulation of public util- ities or of any other industry discourages investment in these industries, thereby depriving consumers of the best satisfaction of their wants. For it distorts the resource allocations of the free market. Prices set below the free market create an artificial shortage of the utility service; prices set above those determined 92 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"by the free market impose restrictions and a monopoly price on the consumers. Guaranteed rates of return exempt the utility from the free play of market forces and impose burdens on the consumers by distorting market allocations. The very term “public utility,” furthermore, is an absurd one. Every good is useful “to the public,” and almost every good, if we take a large enough chunk of supply as the unit, may be considered “necessary.” Any designation of a few industries as “public utilities” is completely arbitrary and unjustified. 71 P. T HE R IGHT OF E MINENT D OMAIN In contrast to the franchise, which may be made general and nonexclusive (as long as the central organization of force con- tinues to own the streets), the right of eminent domain could not easily be made general. If it were, then chaos would truly ensue. For when the government confers a privilege of eminent domain (as it has done on railroads and many other businesses), it has virtually granted a license for theft. If everyone had the right of eminent domain, every man would be legally empow- ered to compel the sale of property that he wanted to buy. If A were compelled to sell property to B at the latter’s will, and vice versa , then neither could be called the owner of his own prop- erty. The entire system of private property would then be scrapped in favor of a society of mutual plunder. Saving and accumulation of property for oneself and one’s heirs would be severely discouraged, and rampant plunder would cut ever more sharply into whatever property remained. Civilization would soon revert to barbarism, and the standards of living of the bar- barian would prevail.

Cer- tainly no one can say that the inviolability of private property is protected by the government. And when the government con- fers this power on a particular business, it is conferring upon it the special privilege of taking property by force. Evidently, the use of this privilege greatly distorts the struc- ture of production. Instead of being determined by voluntary exchange, self-ownership, and efficient satisfaction of consumer wants, prices and the allocation of productive resources are now determined by brute force and government favor. The result is an overextension of resources (a malinvestment) in the privi- leged firm or industry and an underinvestment in other firms and industries. At any given time, as we have stressed, there is a limited amount of capital—a limited supply of all resources— that can be devoted to investment. Compulsory increase in investment in one field can be achieved only by an arbitrary decline in investment in other fields. 72 Many advocates of eminent domain contend that “society,” in the last analysis, has the right to use any land for “its” pur- poses. Without knowing it, they have thus conceded the validity of a major Henry Georgist plank: that every person, by virtue of 94 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 72 Inevitably, someone will point to the plight of the railroad or high- way company that must pay “extortionate rates” to the man who “merely” owns the property along the way. Yet these same people do not complain (and properly so) of the fact that property values have enormously increased in downtown areas of cities, thus benefiting someone who “merely” happens to own them. The fact is that all property is available to everyone who finds or buys it; if the property owner in these cases is penalized because of his speculation, then all entrepreneurs must be penalized for their correct forecasting of future events.

Q. B RIBERY OF G OVERNMENT O FFICIALS Because it is illegal, bribery of government officials receives practically no mention in economic works. Economic science, however, should analyze all aspects of mutual exchange, whether these exchanges are legal or illegal. We have seen above that “bribery” of a private firm is not actually bribery at all, but simply payment of the market price for the product. Bribery of government officials is also a price for the payment of a service. What is this service? It is the failure to enforce the government edict as it applies to the particular person paying the bribe. In short, the acceptance of a bribe is equivalent to the sale of permission to engage in a certain line of business. Accep- tance of a bribe is therefore praxeologically identical with the sale of a government license to engage in a business or occupa- tion. And the economic effects are similar to those of a license. There is no economic difference between the purchase of a gov- ernment permission to operate by buying a license or by paying Triangular Intervention 95 73 Except that the eminent-domain thesis is on even shakier ground, since the Georgists at least exempt or try to exempt from the social claim the improvements that the owner has made. 74 See below on the myth of public ownership. As Benjamin R. Tucker pointed out years ago, the Georgist “equal rights” thesis (or eminent domain) leads logically, not to a Single Tax, but to each individual’s right to appropriate his theoretical share of the value of everybody else’s land. The State’s appropriation of this value then becomes sheer robbery of the other individual claims rather than of just the claim of the landowner. See Benjamin R.

What the briber receives, therefore, is an informal, oral license to operate. The fact that different government officials receive the money in the two cases is irrelevant to our discussion. The extent to which an informal license acts as a grant of monopolistic privilege depends on the conditions under which it is granted. In some instances, the official accepts a bribe by one person and in effect grants him a monopoly in a particular area or occupation; in other cases, the official may grant the informal license to anybody who is willing to pay the necessary price. The former is an example of a clear monopoly grant fol- lowed by a possible monopoly price; in the latter case, the bribe acts as a lump-sum tax penalizing poorer competitors who can- not pay. They are forced out of business by the bribe system. However, we must remember that bribery is a consequence of the outlawing of a certain line of production and, therefore, that it serves to mitigate some of the loss of utility imposed on con- sumers and producers by the government prohibition. Given the state of outlawry, bribery is the chief means for the market to reassert itself; bribery moves the economy closer to the free- market situation. 75 In fact, we must distinguish between an invasive bribe and a defensive bribe. The defensive bribe is what we have been dis- cussing; that is, the purchase of a permission to operate after an activity is outlawed. On the other hand, a bribe to attain an exclusive or quasi-exclusive permission, barring others from the field, is an example of an invasive bribe, a payment for a grant of monopolistic privilege. The former is a significant move- ment toward the free market; the latter is a movement away from it. 96 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 75 The same is true of an official license: a firm’s payment for a license is the only means for it to exist. A licensed firm cannot be stamped as a willing party to the monopolistic privilege unless it had helped to lobby for the licensing law’s establishment or continuance, as very often happens."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"R. P OLICY T OWARD M ONOPOLY Economic historians often inquire about the extent and importance of monopoly in the economy. Almost all of this inquiry has been misdirected, because the concept of monopoly has never been cogently defined. In this chapter we have traced types of monopoly and quasi monopoly and their economic effects. It is clear that the term “monopoly” properly applies only to governmental grants of privilege, direct and indirect. Truly gauging the extent of monopoly in an economy means studying the degree and extent of monopoly and quasi-monop- oly privilege that the government has granted. American opinion has been traditionally “antimonopoly.” Yet it is clearly not only pointless but deeply ironic to call upon the government to “pursue a positive antimonopoly policy.” Evidently, all that is necessary to abolish monopoly is that the government abolish its own creations. It is certainly true that in many (if not all) cases the privileged businesses or laborers had themselves agitated for the monopo- listic grant. But it is still true that they could not become quasi monopolists except through the intervention of the State ; it is there- fore the action of the State that must bear prime responsibility. 76 Triangular Intervention 97 76 Historians, however, will go sadly astray if they ignore the monop- olistic motivation for passage of such measures by the State. Historians who are in favor of the free market often neglect this problem and thus leave themselves wide open to opposition charges that they are “apolo- gists for monopoly capital.” Actually, of course, advocates of the free mar- ket are “probusiness,” as they are pro any voluntary relationship, only when it is carried on in the free market. They oppose governmental grants of monopolistic privilege to businesses or others, for to this extent business is no longer free, but a partner of the coercive State. On business responsibility for interventions generally thought to be “antibusiness,” see Gabriel Kolko, The Triumph of Conservatism (Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1963), and idem , Railroads and Regulations, 1877–1916 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965).

Some advocates of the free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann’s The Good Society . 77 It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolis- tic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would sim- ply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation to decide whether or not they will transact business with it. If they do, then they pro- ceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individ- ual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations. 78 A PPENDIX A O N P RIVATE C OINAGE The common, erroneous phrasing of Gresham’s Law (“bad money drives out good money”) has often been used to attack the concept of private coinage as unworkable and thereby to defend the State’s age-old monopolization of the minting busi- ness. As we have seen, however, Gresham’s Law applies to the effect of government policy, not to the free market. The argument most often advanced against private coinage is that the public would be burdened by fraudulent coin and 98 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 77 Walter Lippmann, The Good Society (3rd ed.; New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1943), pp. 277 ff. 78 It is true that limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege, but this does not loom large among the total liabil- ities of any corporation."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"would be forced to test coins frequently for their weight and fineness. The government’s stamp on the coin is supposed to certify its fineness and weight. The long record of the abuse of this certification by governments is well known. Moreover, the argument is hardly unique to the minting business; it proves far too much. In the first place, those minters who fraudulently cer- tify the weight or fineness of coins will be prosecuted for fraud, just as defrauders are prosecuted now. Those who counterfeit the certifications of well-established private minters will meet a fate similar to those who counterfeit money today. Numerous prod- ucts of business depend upon their weight and purity. People will either safeguard their wealth by testing the weight and purity of their coins, as they do their money bullion, or they will mint their coins with private minters who have established a reputation for probity and efficiency. These minters will place their stamps on the coins, and the best minters will soon come into prominence as coiners and as assayers of previously minted coins. Thus, ordinary prudence, the development of good will toward honest and efficient business firms, and legal prosecutions against fraud and counterfeiting would suffice to establish an orderly monetary system. There are numerous industries where the use of instruments of precise weight and fineness are essential and where a mistake would be of greater import than an error involving coins. Yet prudence and the process of market selection of the best firms, coupled with legal prosecution against fraud, have facilitated the purchase and use of the most delicate machine-tools, for example, without any suggestion that the gov- ernment must nationalize the machine-tool industry in order to ensure the quality of the products. Another argument against private coinage is that standardiz- ing the denominations of coin is more convenient than permit- ting the diversity of coins that would ensue under a free system. The answer is that if the market finds standardization more convenient, private mints will be led by consumer demand to confine their minting to certain standard denominations.

A tariff imposed by Govern- ment A prevents an exporter residing under Government B from making a sale. Furthermore, an immigration barrier imposed by Government A prevents a resident of B from migrating. Both of these impositions are effected by coercion. Tariffs as a prelude to war have often been discussed; less under- stood is the Lebensraum argument. “Overpopulation” of one particular country (insofar as it is not the result of a voluntary choice to remain in the homeland at the cost of a lower standard of living) is always the result of an immigration barrier imposed by another country. It may be thought that this barrier is purely a “domestic” one. But is it? By what right does the government of a territory proclaim the power to keep other people away? Under a purely free-market system, only individual property owners have the right to keep people off their property. The government’s power rests on the implicit assumption that the government owns all the territory that it rules. Only then can the government keep people out of that territory. 100 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Caught in an insoluble contradiction are those believers in the free market and private property who still uphold immigration barriers.

At present, the State owns all unused property, but it is clear that this is conquest incompatible with the free market. In a truly free mar- ket, for example, it would be inconceivable that an Australian agency could arise, laying claim to “ownership” over the vast tracts of unused land on that continent and using force to pre- vent people from other areas from entering and cultivating that land. It would also be inconceivable that a State could keep peo- ple from other areas out of property that the “domestic” prop- erty owner wishes them to use.

Introduction: Government Revenues and Expenditures A N INTERVENTIONARY AGENCY , SUCH AS the government, must spend funds; in the monetary economy, this means spending money. This money can be derived only from revenues (or income). The bulk of the revenue (and the reason the agency is called interventionary) must come from two sources: in the case of the government, taxation and inflation . Taxation is a coerced levy that the government extracts from the populace; inflation is the basically fraudulent issue of pseudo warehouse-receipts for money, or new money. Inflation, which poses special prob- lems of its own, has been dealt with elsewhere. 1 This chapter focuses on taxation. We are discussing the government for the most part, since empirically it is the prime organization for coercive interven- tion. However, our analysis will actually apply to all coercive organizations. If governments budget their revenues and expen- ditures, so must criminals; where a government levies taxes, criminals extract their own brand of coerced levies; where a government issues fraudulent or fiat money, criminals may counterfeit. It should be understood that, praxeologically, there 1 See Man, Economy, and State (1962, pp. 850–78; 2004, pp. 989–1023). 103 4 B INARY I NTERVENTION : T AXATION"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"is no difference between the nature and effects of taxation and inflation on the one hand, and of robberies and counterfeiting on the other. Both intervene coercively in the market, to bene- fit one set of people at the expense of another set. But the gov- ernment imposes its jurisdiction over a wide area and usually operates unmolested. Criminals, on the contrary, usually impose their jurisdiction on a narrow area only and generally eke out a precarious existence. Even this distinction does not always hold true, however. In many parts of many countries, bandit groups win the passive consent of the majority in a par- ticular area and establish what amounts to effective govern- ments, or States, within the area. The difference between a gov- ernment and a criminal band, then, is a matter of degree rather than kind, and the two often shade into each other. Thus, a defeated government in a civil war may often take on the status of a bandit group, clinging to a small area of the country. And there is no praxeological difference between the two. 2 104 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 2 The striking title of Mr. Chodorov’s pamphlet is, therefore, praxeo- logically, accurate: see Frank Chodorov, Taxation is Robbery (Chicago: Human Events Associates, 1947), reprinted in Chodorov, Out of Step (New York: Devin-Adair, 1962), pp. 216–39. As Chodorov says: A historical study of taxation leads inevitably to loot, trib- ute, ransom—the economic purpose of conquest. The barons who put up toll-gates along the Rhine were tax- gatherers. So were the gangs who “protected,” for a forced fee, the caravans going to market. The Danes who regularly invited themselves into England, and remained as unwanted guests until paid off, called it Dannegeld; for a long time that remained the basis of English property taxes. The conquering Romans introduced the idea that what they collected from subject peoples was merely just payment for maintaining law and order. For a long time the Norman conquerors collected catch-as-catch-can tribute from the English, but when by natural processes an amalgam of the two peoples resulted in a nation, the collections were regularized in custom and law and were called taxes.

But the government cannot spend money until it obtains it as revenue— whether that revenue comes from taxation, inflation, or bor- rowing from the public. On the other hand, all revenue is spent. Revenue can differ from expenditure only in the rare case of deflation of part of the government funds (or government hoard- ing, if the standard is purely specie). In that case, as we shall see below, revenues are not a full burden, but government expendi- tures are more burdensome than their monetary amount would indicate, because the real proportion of government expendi- tures to the national income will have increased. For the rest of this chapter, we shall assume that there is no such fiscal deflation and, therefore, that every increase in taxes is matched by an increase in government expenditures. 2. The Burdens and Benefits of Taxation and Expenditures As Calhoun brilliantly pointed out (see chapter 2 above), there are two groups of individuals in society: the taxpayers and the tax consumers —those who are burdened by taxes and those who benefit. Who is burdened by taxation? The direct or immediate answer is: those who pay taxes. We shall postpone the questions of the shifting of tax burdens to a later section. Who benefits from taxation? It is clear that the primary ben- eficiaries are those who live full-time off the proceeds, e.g., the politicians and the bureaucracy. These are the full-time rulers. It should be clear that regardless of legal forms, the bureaucrats pay no taxes; they consume taxes. 3 Additional beneficiaries of Binary Intervention: Taxation 105 3 If a bureaucrat receives a salary of $5,000 a year and pays $1,000 in “taxes” to the government, it is quite obvious that he is simply receiving a salary of $4,000 and pays no taxes at all.

Generally, a State can- not win the passive support of a majority unless it supplements its full-time employees, i.e., its members, with subsidized adherents. The hiring of bureaucrats and the subsidizing of oth- ers are essential in order to win active support from a large group of the populace. Once a State can cement a large group of active adherents to its cause, it can count on the ignorance and apathy of the remainder of the public to win passive adher- ence from a majority and to reduce any active opposition to a bare minimum. The problem of the diffusion of expenditures and benefits is, however, more complicated when the government spends money for its various activities and enterprises. In this case, it acts always as a consumer of resources (e.g., military expendi- tures, public works, etc.), and it puts tax money into circulation by spending it on factors of production. Suppose, to make the illustration clearer, the government taxes the codfish industry and uses the proceeds of this tax to spend money on armaments. The first receiver of the money is the armament manufacturer, who pays it out to his suppliers and the owners of original fac- tors, etc. In the meantime, the codfish industry, stripped of cap- ital, reduces its demand for factors. In both cases, the burdens and benefits diffuse themselves throughout the economy. “Con- sumer” demand, by virtue of State coercion, has shifted from codfish to armaments. The result imposes short-run losses on the codfish industry and those who supply it, and short-run gains on the armaments industry and those who supply it. As the ripples of expenditure are pushed further and further back, the impact dies out, having been strongest at the points of first contact, i.e., the codfish and the armament industries. In the long run, however, all firms and all industries earn a uniform 106 Power and Market: Government and the Economy same income.

The nonspecific or convertible factors will tend to shift out of the codfish and into the armaments industry. 4 The purely specific or nonconvertible original factors will remain to bear the full burden of the loss and to reap the gain respectively. Even the nonspecific factors will bear losses and reap gains, though to a lesser degree. The major effect of the change, how- ever, will eventually be felt by the owners of the specific origi- nal factors, largely the landowners of the two industries. Taxes are compatible with equilibrium, and therefore we may trace the long-run effects of a tax and expenditure in this manner. 5 In the short run, of course, entrepreneurs suffer losses and earn profits because of the shift in demand. All government expenditure for resources is a form of con- sumption expenditure, in the sense that the money is spent on various items because the government officials so decree. The purchases may therefore be called the consumption expenditure of government officials. It is true that the officials do not con- sume the product directly, but their wish has altered the produc- tion pattern to make these goods, and therefore they may be called its “consumers.” 6 As will be seen further below, all talk of government “investment” is fallacious. Binary Intervention: Taxation 107 4 The shift will not necessarily, or even probably, be from the codfish to the armament industry directly. Rather, factors will shift from the cod- fish to other, related industries and to the armament industry from its related lines. 5 The diffusion effect of inflation differs from that of taxation in two ways: ( a ) it is not compatible with a long-run equilibrium, and ( b ) the new money always benefits the first half of the money receivers and penalizes the last half. Taxation-diffusion has the same effect at first, but shifting alters incidence in the final reckoning. 6 On the other hand, since the officials do not usually consume the products directly, they often believe that they are acting on behalf of the consumers. Hence, their choices are liable to an enormous degree of error. Alec Nove has pointed out that if these choices were simply the consumer preferences of the government planners themselves, they would not, as"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Taxation always has a two-fold effect: (1) it distorts the allo- cation of resources in the society, so that consumers can no longer most efficiently satisfy their wants; and (2) for the first time, it severs “distribution” from production. It brings the “problem of distribution” into being. The first point is clear; government coerces consumers into giving up part of their income to the State, which then bids away resources from these same consumers. Hence, the con- sumers are burdened, their standard of living is lowered, and the allocation of resources is distorted away from consumer sat- isfaction toward the satisfaction of the ends of the government. More detailed analysis of the distorting effects of different types of taxes will be presented below. The essential point is that the object of many economists’ quest, a neutral tax , i.e., a tax that will leave the market exactly the same as it was without taxation, must always be a chimera. No tax can be truly neutral; every one will cause distortion. Neutrality can be achieved only on a purely free market, where governmental revenues are obtained by voluntary purchase only. 7 It is often stated that “capitalism has solved the problem of production,” and that the State must now intervene to “solve the problem of distribution.” A more clearly erroneous formu- lation would be difficult to conceive. For the “problem of pro- duction” will never be solved until we are all in the Garden of Eden. Furthermore, there is no “problem of distribution” on the free market.

There is no distributional process apart from the production and exchange of the market; hence, the very concept of “distribution” as something separate becomes mean- ingless. Since the free-market process benefits all participants on the market and increases social utility, it follows directly that the “distributional” results of the free market—the pattern of income and wealth—also increases social utility and, in fact, maximizes it at any given time. When the government takes from Peter and gives to Paul, it then creates a separate distribu- tion process and a “problem” of distribution. No longer do income and wealth flow purely from service rendered on the market; they now flow from special privilege created by the coercion of the State. Wealth is now distributed to “exploiters” at the expense of the “exploited.” 9 The crucial point is that the extent of the distortion of resources, and of the State’s plunder of producers, is in direct proportion to the level of taxation and government expendi- tures in the economy, as compared with the level of private income and wealth. It is a major contention of our analysis—in contrast to many other discussions of the subject—that by far the most important impact of taxation results not so much from the type of tax as from its amount. It is the total level of taxation, of government income compared with the income of the private sector, that is the most important consideration. Far too much significance has been attached in the literature to the type of tax—to whether it is an income tax, progressive or proportional, sales tax, spending tax, etc. Though important, this is subordi- nate to the significance of the total level of taxation.

The Incidence and Effects of Taxation Part I: Taxes on Incomes A. T HE G ENERAL S ALES T AX AND THE L AWS OF I NCIDENCE One of the oldest problems connected with taxation is: Who pays the tax? It would seem that the answer is clear-cut, since the government knows on whom it levies a tax. The problem, how- ever, is not who pays the tax immediately , but who pays it in the long run, i.e., whether or not the tax can be “shifted” from the immediate taxpayer to somebody else. Shifting occurs if the immediate taxpayer is able to raise his selling price to cover the tax, thus “shifting” the tax to the buyer, or if he is able to lower the buying price of something he buys, thus “shifting” the tax to some other seller. In addition to this problem of the incidence of taxation, there is the problem of analyzing other economic effects of various types and amounts of taxes. The first law of incidence can be laid down immediately, and it is a rather radical one: No tax can be shifted forward . In other words, no tax can be shifted from seller to buyer and on to the ultimate consumer. Below, we shall see how this applies specif- ically to excise and sales taxes, which are commonly thought to be shifted forward. It is generally considered that any tax on production or sales increases the cost of production and there- fore is passed on as an increase in price to the consumer. Prices, however, are never determined by costs of production, but rather the reverse is true. The price of a good is determined by its total stock in existence and the demand schedule for it on the market. But the demand schedule is not affected at all by the tax. The selling price is set by any firm at the maximum net rev- enue point, and any higher price, given the demand schedule, will simply decrease net revenue. A tax, therefore, cannot be passed on to the consumer. It is true that a tax can be shifted forward, in a sense, if the tax causes the supply of the good to decrease, and therefore the 110 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"price to rise on the market. This can hardly be called shifting per se , however, for shifting implies that the tax is passed on with little or no trouble to the producer. If some producers must go out of business in order for the tax to be “shifted,” it is hardly shifting in the proper sense but should be placed in the category of other effects of taxation. A general sales tax is the classic example of a tax on producers that is believed to be shifted forward. The government, let us say, imposes a 20-percent tax on all sales at retail. We shall assume that the tax can be equally well enforced in all branches of sales. 10 To most people, it seems obvious that the business will simply add 20 percent to their selling prices and merely serve as unpaid collection agencies for the government. The problem is hardly that simple, however. In fact, as we have seen, there is no reason whatever to believe that prices can be raised at all. Prices are already at the point of maximum net revenue, the stock has not been decreased, and demand schedules have not changed. Therefore, prices cannot be increased. Further- more, if we look at the general array of prices, these are deter- mined by the supply of and the demand for money. For the array of prices to rise, there must be an increase in the supply of money, a decrease in the schedule of the demand for money, or both. Yet neither of these alternatives has occurred. The demand for money to hold has not decreased, the supply of goods available for money has not declined, and the supply of money has remained constant. There is no possible way that a general price increase can be obtained. 11 Binary Intervention: Taxation 111 10 Usually, of course, it cannot, and the result will be equivalent to a specific excise tax on some branches of sales, but not on others. 11 Whereas a partial excise tax will eventually cause a drop in supply and therefore a rise in the price of the product, there is no way by which resources can escape a general tax except into idleness. Since, as we shall see, a sales tax is a tax on incomes, the rise in the opportunity cost of leisure may push some workers into idleness, and thereby lower the quan- tity of goods produced. To this tenuous extent, prices will rise. See the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"It should be quite evident that if businesses were able to pass tax increases along to the consumer in the form of higher prices, they would have raised these prices already without waiting for the spur of a tax increase. Businesses do not deliberately peg along at the lowest selling prices they can find. If the state of demand had permitted higher prices, firms would have taken advantage of this fact long before. It might be objected that a sales tax increase is general and therefore that all the firms together can shift the tax. Each firm, however, follows the state of the demand curve for its own product, and none of these demand curves has changed. A tax increase does nothing to make higher prices more profitable. The myth that a sales tax can be shifted forward is compara- ble to the myth that a general union-imposed wage increase can be shifted forward to higher prices, thereby “causing inflation.” There is no way that the general array of prices can rise, and the only result of such a wage increase will be mass unemploy- ment. 12 Many people are misled by the fact that the price the con- sumer pays must necessarily include the tax. When someone goes to a movie and sees prominently posted the information that the $1.00 admission covers a “price” of 85cents and a tax of 15 cents, he tends to conclude that the tax has simply been added on to the “price.” But $1.00 is the price, not 85cents, the latter sum being the income accruing to the firm after taxes. This income might well have been reduced to allow for payment of taxes. 112 Power and Market: Government and the Economy pioneering article by Harry Gunnison Brown, “The Incidence of a Gen- eral Sales Tax,” reprinted in R.A. Musgrave and C.S. Shoup, eds., Read- ings in the Economics of Taxation (Homewood, Ill.: Richard D. Irwin, 1959), pp. 330–39. This was the first modern attack on the fallacy that sales taxes are shifted forward, but Brown unfortunately weakened the implications of this thesis toward the end of his article. 12 Of course, if the money supply is increased and credit expanded, prices can be raised so that money wages are no longer above their dis- counted marginal value products."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Binary Intervention: Taxation 113 13 If the government does not spend all of its revenue, then deflation is added to the impact of taxation. See below. In fact, this is precisely the effect of a general sales tax. Its immediate impact lowers the gross revenue of firms by the amount of the tax. In the long run, of course, firms cannot pay the tax, for their loss in gross revenue is imputed back to inter- est income by capitalists and to wages and rents earned by orig- inal factors—labor and ground land. A decrease in the gross revenue of retail firms is reflected back to a decreased demand for the products of all the higher-order firms. All the firms, however, earn, in the long run, a pure uniform interest return. Here a difference arises between a general sales tax and, say, a corporate income tax. There has been no change in time-pref- erence schedules or other components of the interest rate. While an income tax compels a lower percent interest return, a sales tax can and will be shifted completely from investment and back to the original factors. The result of a general sales tax is a general reduction in the net revenue accruing to original fac- tors: to all wages and ground rents. The sales tax has been shifted backwards to original factor returns. No longer does every orig- inal factor of production earn its discounted marginal value product. Now, original factors earn less than their DMVPs, the reduction consisting of the sales tax paid to the government. It is necessary now to integrate this analysis of the incidence of a general sales tax with our previous general analysis of the benefits and burdens of taxation. This is accomplished by remembering that the proceeds of taxation are, in turn, spent by the government. 13 Whether the government spends the money for resources for its own activities or simply transfers the money to people it subsidizes, the result is to shift consumption and investment demand from private hands to the government or to government-supported individuals, by the amount of the tax revenue. In this case, the tax has been ultimately levied on the incomes of original factors, and the money transferred from their"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"hands to the government. The income of the government and/or those it subsidizes has been increased at the expense of those taxed, and therefore consumption and investment demands on the market have been shifted from the latter to the former by the amount of the tax. As a consequence, the value of the money unit will remain unchanged (barring a difference in demands for money between the taxpayers and the tax con- sumers), but the array of prices will shift in accordance with the shift in demands. Thus, if the market has been spending heavily on clothing, and the government uses the revenue mostly for the purchase of arms, there will be a fall in the price of clothes, a rise in the price of arms, and a tendency for nonspecific factors to shift out of clothing and into the production of armaments. As a result, there will not be, as might be assumed, a propor- tional 20-percent fall in the incomes of all original factors as a result of a 20-percent general sales tax. Specific factors in indus- tries that have lost business as a result of the shift from private to governmental demand will lose proportionately more in income. Specific factors in industries gaining in demand will lose proportionately less, and some may gain so much as to gain absolutely as a result of the change. Nonspecific factors will not be affected as much proportionately, but they too will lose and gain according to the difference that the concrete shift in demand makes in their marginal value productivity. The knowledge that taxes can never be shifted forward is a consequence of adhering to the “Austrian” analysis of value, i.e., that prices are determined by ultimate demands for stock, and not in any sense by the “cost of production.” Unhappily, all previous discussions of the incidence of taxation have been marred by hangovers of classical “cost-of-production” theory and the failure to adopt a consistent “Austrian” approach. The Austrian econo- mists themselves never really applied their doctrines to the the- ory of tax incidence, so that this discussion breaks new ground. The shifting-forward doctrine has actually been carried to its logical, and absurd, conclusion that producers shift taxes to 114 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"consumers, and consumers, in turn, can shift them to their employers, and so on ad infinitum , with no one really paying any tax at all. 14 It should be carefully noted that the general sales tax is a conspicuous example of failure to tax consumption. It is com- monly supposed that a sales tax penalizes consumption rather than income or capital. But we find that the sales tax reduces, not just consumption, but the incomes of original factors. The general sales tax is an income tax, albeit a rather haphazard one, since there is no way that its impact on income classes can be made uniform. Many “right-wing” economists have advocated general sales taxation, as opposed to income taxation, on the ground that the former taxes consumption but not savings- investment; many “left-wing” economists have opposed sales taxation for the same reason. Both are mistaken; the sales tax is an income tax, though of more haphazard and uncertain inci- dence. The major effect of the general sales tax will be that of the income tax: to reduce the consumption and the savings- investment of the taxpayers. 15 In fact, since, as we shall see, the Binary Intervention: Taxation 115 14 For example, see E.R.A. Seligman, The Shifting and Incidence of Tax- ation (2nd ed.; New York: Macmillan & Co., 1899), pp. 122–33. 15 Mr. Frank Chodorov, in his The Income Tax—Root of All Evil (New York: Devin-Adair, 1954), fails to indicate what other type of tax would be “better” from a free-market point of view than the income tax. It will be clear from our discussion that there are few taxes indeed that will not be as bad as the income tax from the viewpoint of an advocate of the free market. Certainly, sales or excise taxation will not fill the bill. Chodorov, furthermore, is surely wrong when he terms income and inheritance taxes unique denials of the right of individual property. Any tax whatever infringes on property rights, and there is nothing in an “indirect tax” which makes that infringement any less clear. It is true that an income tax forces the subject to keep records and disclose his personal dealings, thus imposing a further loss in his utility. The sales tax, however, also forces record-keeping; the difference again is one of degree rather than of kind, for here the extent of directness covers only retail store- keepers instead of the bulk of the population."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"income tax by its nature falls more heavily on savings-invest- ment than on consumption, we reach the paradoxical and important conclusion that a tax on consumption will also fall more heavily on savings-investment , in its ultimate incidence. B. P ARTIAL E XCISE T AXES ; O THER P RODUCTION T AXES The partial excise tax is a sales tax levied on some , rather than all, commodities. The chief distinction between this and the general sales tax is that the latter does not, in itself , distort pro- ductive allocations on the market, since a tax is levied propor- tionately on the sale of all final products. A partial excise, on the other hand, penalizes certain lines of production. The general sales tax, of course, distorts market allocations insofar as gov- ernment expenditures from the proceeds differ in structure from private demands in the absence of the tax. The excise tax has this effect, too, and, in addition , penalizes the particular industry taxed. The tax cannot be shifted forward, but tends to be shifted backward to the factors working in the industry. Now, however, the tax exerts pressure on nonspecific factors and entrepreneurs to leave the taxed industry and enter other, non- taxed industries. During the transition period , the tax may well be added to cost. As the price, however, cannot be directly increased, the marginal firms in this industry will be driven out of business and will seek better opportunities elsewhere. The exodus of nonspecific factors, and perhaps firms, from the taxed industry reduces the stock of the good that will be produced. This reduction in stock, or supply, will raise the market price of the good, given the consumers’ demand schedule. Thus, there is a sort of “indirect shifting” in the sense that the price of the good to consumers will ultimately increase. However, as we have stated, it is not appropriate to call this “shifting,” a term better reserved for an effortless, direct passing on of a tax in the price. Everyone in the market suffers as a result of an excise tax. Nonspecific factors must shift to fields of lower income; since the discounted marginal value product is lower there, specific factors are hit particularly hard, and consumers suffer as the 116 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"allocations of factors and the price structure are distorted in comparison with what would have satisfied their desires. The supply of factors in the taxed industries becomes excessively low, and the selling price in these industries too high; while the supply of factors in other industries becomes excessively large, and their product prices too low. In addition to those specific effects, the excise tax also has the same general effect as all other taxes, viz., that the pattern of market demands is distorted from private to government or government-subsidized wants by the amount of the tax intake. Far too much has been written on the elasticity of demand in relation to the effect of taxation. We know that the demand schedule for one firm is always elastic above the free-market price. And the cost of production is not something fixed, but is in itself determined by the selling price. Most important, since the demand curve for a good is always falling, any decrease in the stock will raise the market price, and any increase in the stock will lower the price, regardless of the elasticity of demand for the product. Elasticity of demand is a topic that warrants only a relatively minor role in economic theory. 16 In sum, an excise tax ( a ) injures consumers in the same way that all taxes do, by shifting resources and demands from private consumers to the State; and ( b ) injures consumers and produc- ers in its own particular way by distorting market allocations, prices, and factor revenues; but ( c ) cannot be considered a tax on consumption in the sense that the tax is shifted to consumers. The excise tax is also a tax on incomes , except that in this case the effect is not general because the impact falls most heavily on the factors specific to the taxed industry. Any partial tax on production will have effects similar to an excise tax.

In contrast to the latter, however, the indirect grant of monopolistic privilege will benefit the specific, quasi-monopo- lized factors that are able to remain in the industry. C. G ENERAL E FFECTS OF I NCOME T AXATION In the dynamic real economy, money income consists of wages, ground rents, interest, and profits, counterbalanced by losses. (Ground rents are also capitalized on the market, so that income from rents is resolvable into interest and profit, minus losses.) The income tax is designed to tax all such net income. We have seen that sales and excise taxes are really taxes on some original-factor incomes. This has been generally ignored, and perhaps one reason is that people are accustomed to thinking of income taxation as being uniformly levied on all incomes of the same amount. Later, we shall see that the uniformity of such a levy has been widely upheld as an important “canon of justice” for taxation. Actually, no such uniformity does or need exist. Excise and sales taxes, as we have seen, are not uniformly levied, but are imposed on some income receivers and not others of the same income class. It must be recognized that the official income tax , the tax that is generally known as the “income tax,” is by no means the only form in which income is, or can be, taxed by the government. 17 An income tax cannot be shifted to anyone else. The taxpayer himself bears the burden. He earns profits from entrepreneurial activity, interest from time preference, and other income from marginal productivity, and none can be increased to cover the tax. Income taxation reduces every taxpayer’s money income and real income, and hence his standard of living. His income from working is more expensive, and leisure cheaper, so that he will 118 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"tend to work less. Everyone’s standard of living in the form of exchangeable goods will decline. In rebuttal, much has been made of the fact that every man’s marginal utility of money rises as his money assets fall and, therefore, that there may be a rise in the marginal utility of the reduced income obtainable from his current expenditure of labor. It is true, in other words, that the same labor now earns every man less money, but this very reduction in money income may also raise the marginal utility of a unit of money to the extent that the marginal utility of his total income will be raised , and he will be induced to work harder as a result of the income tax. This may very well be true in some cases, and there is nothing mysterious or contrary to economic analysis in such an event. However, it is hardly a blessing for the man or for society. For, if more work is expended, leisure is lost, and people’s standards of living are lower because of this coerced loss. In the free market, in short, individuals are always balancing their money income (or real income in exchangeable goods) against their real income in the form of leisure activities. Both are basic components of the standard of living. The greater their exchangeable-goods income, in fact, the higher will be their marginal utility of a unit of leisure time (nonexchangeable goods), and the more proportionately will they “take” their income in the form of leisure. It is not surprising, therefore, that a coerced lower income may force individuals to work harder. Whichever the effect, the tax lowers the standard of liv- ing of the taxpayers, either depriving them of leisure or of exchangeable goods. In addition to penalizing work relative to leisure, an income tax also penalizes work for money as against work for a return in kind. Obviously, a relative advantage is conferred on work done for a nonmonetary reward. Working women are penalized as compared with housewives; people will tend to work for their families rather than enter into the labor market, etc. “Do-it- yourself” activities are stimulated. In short, the Binary Intervention: Taxation 119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"income tax tends to bring about a reduction in specialization and a breakdown of the market, and hence a retrogression in living standards. 18 Make the income tax high enough, and the market will disintegrate altogether, and primitive economic conditions will prevail. The income tax confiscates a certain portion of a person’s income, leaving him free to allocate the remainder between consumption and investment. It might be thought that, since we may assume time-preference schedules as given, the proportion of consumption to savings-investment—and the pure interest rate—will remain unaffected by the income tax. But this is not so. For the taxpayer’s real income and the value of his monetary assets have been lowered. The lower the level of a man’s real monetary assets, the higher will his time-preference rate be (given his time-preference schedule) and the higher the propor- tion of his consumption to investment spending. The taxpayer’s position may be seen in the diagram in Figure 4. 120 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 18 See C. Lowell Harriss, “Public Finance” in Bernard F.

Now the government levies an income tax, reducing his initial mon- etary assets at the start of his spending period to 0M 1 . His effec- tive time-preference rate is now higher, at t 2 . We have seen that an individual’s real as well as nominal money assets must decline in order for this result to take place; if there is deflation, the value of the monetary unit will increase roughly in proportion, and, in the long run, time-preference ratios, ceteris paribus , will not be changed. In the case of income taxation, however, there will be no change in the value of the monetary unit, since the government will spend the proceeds of taxation. As a result, the taxpayer’s real as well as nominal money assets decline, and decline to the same extent. It might be objected that the government officials or those subsidized receive additional money, and the fall in their time- preference ratios may well offset, or balance, the rise in the rate from the taxpayers’ side. It could not be concluded, then, that the social rate of time-preference will rise, and savings-invest- ment particularly decrease. Government expenditures, how- ever, constitute diversion of resources from private to govern- ment purposes.

As for the transfer expenditures made by the gov- ernment (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the vol- untary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production not desired by the producing consumers. They repre- sent the desires, not of the producing consumers on the free mar- ket, but of exploiting consumers fed by the unilateral coercion of the State. Once let the tax be eliminated, and the producers are free to earn and consume again. The new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be malinvestments . At any rate, the amount consumed by the gov- ernment insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. Some economists maintain that income taxation reduces saving and investment in the society in a third way. They assert that income taxation, by its very nature, imposes a “double” tax on savings-investment as against consumption. 20 The reason- ing runs as follows: Saving and consumption are not really symmetrical. All saving is directed toward enjoying more con- sumption in the future. Otherwise, there would be no point at all in saving. Saving is abstaining from possible present con- sumption in return for the expectation of increased consump- tion at some time in the future. No one wants capital goods for their own sake. 21 They are only the embodiment of an 20 Thus, see Irving and Herbert W. Fisher, Constructive Income Taxation (New York: Harper & Bros., 1942). “Double” is used in the sense of two instances, not arithmetically twice. 21 Although there is much merit in Professor Due’s critique of this general position, he is incorrect in believing that people may own capital for its own sake. If people, because of the uncertainty of the future, wish to hold wealth for its service in relieving risk, they will hold wealth in its most marketable form—cash balances. Capital is far less marketable and is desired only for its fructification in consumers’ goods and earnings"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"increased con sumption in the future. Savings-investment is Crusoe’s building a stick to obtain more apples at a future date; it fructifies in increased consumption later. Hence, the imposi- tion of an income tax excessively penalizes savings-investment as against consumption. 22 This line of reasoning is correct in its explanation of the investment-consumption process. It suffers, however, from one grave defect: it is irrelevant to problems of taxation. It is true that saving is a fructifying agent. But the point is that everyone knows this; that is precisely why people save. Yet, even though they know that saving is a fructifying agent, they do not save all their income. Why? Because of their time preference for present con- sumption. Every individual, given his current income and value scales, allocates that income in the most desired proportion among consumption, investment, and addition to his cash bal- ance. Any other allocation would satisfy his desires to a lesser extent and lower his position on his value scale. There is there- fore no reason here to say that an income tax especially penalizes savings-investment; it penalizes the individual’s entire standard of living, encompassing present consumption, future consump- tion, and his cash balance. It does not per se penalize saving any more than it does the other avenues of income allocation. There is another way, however, in which an income tax does, in fact, levy a particular burden on saving. For the interest return on savings-investment, like all other earnings, is subject to the income tax. The net interest rate received, therefore, is lower than the free-market rate. The return is not consonant with free-market time preferences; instead, the imposed lower return induces people to bring their savings-investment into line with the reduced return; in short, the marginal savings and from the sale of these goods.

The above Fisher-Mill argument is an example of a curious tendency among economists generally devoted to the free mar- ket to be unwilling to consider its ratio of consumption to investment allocations as optimal. The economic case for the free market is that market allocations tend at all points to be optimal with respect to consumer desires. The economists who favor the free market recognize this in most areas of the econ- omy but for some reason show a predilection for and special tenderness toward savings-investment, as against consumption. They tend to feel that a tax on saving is far more of an invasion of the free market than a tax on consumption. It is true that sav- ing embodies future consumption. But people voluntarily choose between present and future consumption in accordance with their time preferences, and this voluntary choice is their optimal choice. Any tax levied particularly on their consumption, therefore, is just as much a distortion and invasion of the free market as a tax on their savings. There is nothing, after all, especially sacred about savings; they are simply the road to future con- sumption. But they are no more important than present con- sumption, the allocation between the two being determined by the time preferences of all individuals. The economist who shows more concern for free-market savings than he does for free-market consumption is implicitly advocating statist inter- ference and a coerced distortion of resource allocation in favor of greater investment and lower consumption. The free-market advocate should oppose with equal fervor coerced distortion of the ratio of consumption to investment in either direction. 23 124 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 23 Thus, one of the standard conservative arguments against progressive income taxation (see below) is that savings would be taxed in greater pro- portion than consumption; many of these writers leave the reader with the inference that if (present) consumption were taxed more heavily, everything would be all right.

D. P ARTICULAR F ORMS OF I NCOME T AXATION (1) Taxes on Wages A tax on wages is an income tax that cannot be shifted away from the wage earner. There is no one to shift it to, especially not the employer, who always tends to earn a uniform interest rate. In fact, there are indirect taxes on wages that are shifted to the wage earner in the form of lower wage incomes. An example is that part of social security, or of unemployment compensation premiums, levied on the employer . Most employees believe that they completely escape this part of the tax, which the employer pays. They are wholly mistaken. The employer, as we have seen, cannot shift the tax forward to the consumer. In fact, since the tax is levied in proportion to wages paid, the tax is shifted back- ward wholly on the wage earners themselves. The employer’s part is simply a collected tax levied at the expense of a reduction of the net wages of the employees. (2) Corporate Income Taxation Taxation of corporate net income imposes a “double” tax on the owners of corporations: once on the official “corporate” income and once on the remaining distributed net income of the owners themselves. The extra tax cannot be shifted forward onto the consumer. Since it is levied on net income itself, it can hardly be shifted backward. It has the effect of penalizing cor- porate income as opposed to income from other market forms Binary Intervention: Taxation 125 adopt that permits them to alter by force the voluntary time-preference ratios between present and future?"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"(single ownership, partnerships, etc.), thereby penalizing effi- cient forms of enterprise and encouraging the inefficient. Resources shift from the former to the latter until the expected rate of net return is equalized throughout the economy—at a lower level than originally. Since interest return is forcibly lower than before, the tax penalizes savings and investment as well as an efficient market form. 24 The penalty, or “double-taxation,” feature of corporate income taxes could be eliminated only by abolishing the tax and treating any net incomes accruing to a corporation as pro rata income to its stockholder-owners. In other words, a corporation would be treated as a partnership, and not according to the absurd fiction that it is some sort of separate real entity func- tioning apart from the actions of its actual owners. Income accruing to the corporation obviously accrues pro rata to the owners. Some writers have objected that the stockholders do not really receive the income on which they would be taxed. Thus, suppose that the Star Corporation earns a net income of $100,000 in a certain period, and that it has three stockhold- ers—Jones, with 40 percent of the stock; Smith, holding 35 per- cent of the stock; and Robinson, owning 25 percent. The majority stockholders, or their management representatives, decide to retain $60,000 as “undistributed” earnings “in the firm,” while paying only $40,000 as dividends. Under present law, Jones’ net income from the Star Corporation is considered as $16,000, Smith’s as $14,000, and Robinson’s as $10,000; the “corporation’s” is listed at $100,000. Each of these entities is then taxed on these amounts. Yet, since there is no real corpo- rate entity separate from its owners, the incomes would be more properly recorded as follows: Jones, $40,000; Smith, $35,000; 126 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 24 Some writers have pointed out that the penalty lowers future con- sumption from what it would have been, reducing the supply of goods and raising prices to consumers. This can hardly be called “shifting,” however, but is rather a manifestation of the ultimate effect of the tax in reducing consumer standards of living from the free-market level."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Robinson, $25,000. The fact that these stockholders do not actually receive the money is no objection; for what happens is the equivalent of someone’s earning money yet keeping it on account without bothering to draw it out and use it. Interest that piles up in someone’s savings bank account is considered as income and taxed accordingly, and there is no reason why “undistributed” earnings should not be considered individual income as well. The fact that total corporate income is first taxed and then “distributed” as dividend income to be taxed again, encourages a further distortion of market investment and organization. For this practice encourages stockholders to leave a greater propor- tion of their earnings undistributed than they would have done in a free market. Earnings are “frozen in” and either held or invested in an uneconomic fashion in relation to the satisfaction of consumer wants. To the reply that this at least fosters invest- ment, there are two rejoinders: (1) that a distortion in favor of investment is as much a distortion of optimum market alloca- tions as anything else; and (2) that not “investment” is encour- aged, but rather frozen investment by owners back into their original firms at the expense of mobile investment. This distorts and renders inefficient the pattern and allocation of investment funds and tends to freeze them in the original firms, discourag- ing the diffusion of funds to different concerns. Dividends, after all, are not necessarily consumed: they may be reinvested in other firms and other investment opportunities. The corporate income tax greatly hampers the adjustment of the economy to dynamic changes in conditions. (3) “Excess” Profit Taxation This tax is generally levied on that part of business net income, dubbed “excess,” which is greater than a base income in a previous period of time. A penalty tax on “excess” business income directly penalizes efficient adjustment of the economy. The profit drive by entrepreneurs is the motive power that adjusts, estimates, and coordinates the economic system so as to Binary Intervention: Taxation 127"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"maximize producer income in the service of maximizing con- sumer satisfactions. It is the process by which malinvestments are kept to a minimum, and good forecasts encouraged, so as to arrange advance production to be in close harmony with con- sumer desires at the date when the final product appears on the market. Attacking profits “doubly” disrupts and hampers the whole market-adjustment process. Such a tax penalizes efficient entrepreneurship. Furthermore, it helps to freeze market pat- terns and entrepreneurial positions as they were in some previ- ous time period, thus distorting the economy more and more as time passes. No economic justification can be found for attempting to freeze market patterns in the mould of some pre- vious period. The greater the changes in economic data that have occurred, the more important it is not to tax “excess” prof- its, or any form of “excess” revenue for that matter; otherwise, adaptation to the new conditions will be blocked just when rapid adjustment is particularly required. It is difficult to find a tax more indefensible from more points of view than this one. (4) The Capital Gains Problem Much discussion has raged over the question: Are capital gains income? It seems evident that they are; indeed, capital gain is one of the leading forms of income. In fact, capital gain is the same as profit . Those who desire uniformity of income-pat- tern taxation would therefore have to include capital gains if all forms of monetary profit are to be brought into the category of taxable income. 25 Using as an example the Star Corporation 128 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 25 It must not be inferred that the present author is an advocate of uni- form taxation. Uniformity, in fact, will be sharply criticized below as an ideal impossible of attainment. (An ethical goal absolutely impossible of attain ment is an absurd goal; to this extent we may engage, not in ethi- cal exhortation, but in praxeological criticism of the possibility of realiz- ing certain ethical goals.) However, it is analytically more convenient to treat various types of income taxation in relation to uniform treatment of all income."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"described above, let us consider Time 1 to be the period just after the corporation has earned $100,000 net income and just before it decides where to allocate this income. In short, it is at a decision point in time. It has earned a profit of $100,000. 26 At Time 1 , its capital value has therefore increased by $100,000. The stockholders have, in the aggregate, earned a capital gain of $100,000, but this is the same as their aggregate profit. Now the Star Corporation keeps $60,000 and distributes $40,000 in dividends, and for the sake of simplicity we shall assume that the stockholders consume this amount. What is the situation at Time 2 , after this allocation has taken place? In comparison with the situation prevailing originally, say at Time 0 , we find that the capital value of the Star Corporation has increased by $60,000. This is unquestionably part of the income of the stockholders; yet, if uniform income taxation is desired, there is no need to levy a tax on it, for it was already included in the $100,000 income of the stockholders subject to tax. The stock market always tends toward an accurate reflection of the capital value of a firm; one might think, therefore, that the quoted value of the firm’s shares would increase, in the aggregate, by $60,000. In the dynamic world, however, the stock market reflects anticipations of future profit, and there- fore its values will diverge from the relatively ex post accounting of the firm’s balance sheet. Furthermore, entrepreneurship, in addition to profits and losses, will be reflected in the valuations of the stock market as well as in business enterprises directly. A firm may be making slim profits now, but a farseeing entrepre- neur will purchase stock from more shortsighted ones. A rise in price will net him a capital gain, and this is a reflection of his Binary Intervention: Taxation 129 26 For the sake of convenience, we are assuming that this income is pure profit, and that interest income has already been disposed of. Only pure profit increases capital value, for in the evenly rotating economy there will be no net savings, and the interest income will just pay for maintaining the capital income structure intact."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"entrepreneurial wisdom in directing capital. Since it would be impossible administratively to identify the profits of the firm, it would be better from the point of view of uniform income tax- ation not to tax the business income of corporate stockholders at all, but to tax a stockholder’s capital gains instead. Whatever gains the owners reap will be reflected in capital gains on their stock anyway, so that taxation of the business income itself becomes unnecessary. On the other hand, taxation of business income while exempting capital gains would exclude from “income” the entrepreneurial gains reaped on the stock market. In the case of partnerships and single enterprises that are not owned in shares of stock, the business income of the owners would, of course, be taxed directly. Taxation of both business income (i.e., profits accruing to stockholders) and capital gains on stock would impose a double tax on efficient entrepreneurs. A genuinely uniform income tax, then, would not tax a stock- holder’s pro rata business income at all, but rather the capital gain from his shares of stock. If business profits (or capital gains) are income subject to tax, then, of course, business losses or capital losses are a negative income, deductible from other income earned by any particular individual. What of the problem of land and housing? Here, the same situation obtains. Landlords earn income annually, and this may be included in their net income as business profits. How- ever, real estate, while not given to stock ownership, also has a flourishing capital market. Land is capitalized, and capital val- ues increase or dwindle on the capital market. It is clear that, once again, the government has an alternative if it desires to impose uniform personal income taxes: either it can impose the tax on net profits from real estate, or it can forgo this and impose a tax on increases in the capital values of real estate. If it does the former, it will omit the entrepreneurial gains and losses made on the capital market, the regulator and anticipator of investment and demand; if it does both, it imposes a double 130 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"tax on this form of business. The best solution (once again within the context of a uniform income tax) is to impose a tax on the capital gain minus the capital loss on the land values. It must be emphasized that a capital gains tax is truly an income tax only when it is levied on accrued , rather than on real- ized , capital gains or losses. In other words, if a man’s capital assets have increased during a certain period, from 300 ounces of gold to 400 ounces, his income is 100 ounces, whether or not he has sold the asset to “take” the profit. In any period, his earn- ings consist not simply in what he may use for spending. The situation is analogous to that of a corporation’s undistributed profits, which as we have seen, must be included in each stock- holder’s accumulation of income. Taxing realized gains and losses introduces great distortions into the economy; it then becomes highly advantageous to investors never to sell their stock, but to hand it down to future generations. Any sale would require the old owner to pay the capital gains levy accumulated for an entire period. The effect is to “freeze” an investment in the hands of one person, and particularly of one family, for gen- erations. The result is rigidity in the economy and failure of the hampered market to meet flexibly the continual changes in data that always take place. As time goes on, the distortive effects of the economic rigidity grow worse and worse. Another serious hampering of the capital market results from the fact that, once the capital gain is “taken” or realized, the income tax on this particular gain is actually far higher and not uniform. For the capital gains accrue over a long stretch of time, and not simply at the point of sale. But the income tax is based only on each year’s realized income. In other words, a man who realizes his gain in a certain year must pay a far bigger tax in that year than would be “justified” by a tax on his actually acquired income during the year. Suppose, for example, that a man buys a capital asset at 50 and its market value increases by 10 each year, until he finally sells it for 90 in four years’ time. For three years, his income of 10 goes untaxed, while in the fourth year he Binary Intervention: Taxation 131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"is taxed on an income of 40 when his income was only 10. The final tax, therefore, largely becomes one on a ccumulated capital rather than on income. 27 The incentive for keeping investment rigid, therefore, becomes even greater. 28 There are, of course, grave difficulties in any such tax on accrued capital gains, but, as we shall see, there are many insu- perable obstacles to any attempt to impose uniform income taxes. Estimates of market value would pose the greatest problem. Appraisals are always simply conjectures, and there would be no way of knowing that the assessed value was the correct one. Another insuperable difficulty arises from changes in the pur- chasing power of the monetary unit. If the purchasing power has fallen in half, then a change in capital value of an asset from 50 to 100 does not represent a real capital gain; it simply reflects the maintenance of real capital as nominal values double. Clearly, a constant nominal value of capital when other prices and values double would reflect a high capital loss —a halving of real capital value. To reflect gains or losses in income, then, a person’s capi- tal gain or loss would have to be corrected for changes in the pur- chasing power of money. Thus, a fall in purchasing power tends to result in the overstatement of business income and hence leads to a consumption of capital. But if a man’s capital gains or losses must be corrected for changes in the purchasing power of money in order to state his true income for a certain period, what stan- dards can be used for such a correction? For changes in purchas- ing power cannot be measured. Any “index” used would be purely arbitrary. Whichever method is adopted, therefore, uniformity in income taxation cannot be achieved, because an accurate meas- urement of income cannot be attained. 29 132 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 27 For a discussion of taxation on accumulated capital, see below. 28 See Due, Government Finance , p. 146. 29 Another problem in levying a tax on accrued capital gains is that the income is not realized in money directly. Uniform taxation of income in kind, as well as of psychic income, faces insuperable problems, as will be seen below. Just as there may be taxes on the imputed monetary equivalents"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Thus, to the controversial question, “Are capital gains income?” the answer is emphatically yes, provided that (1) a correction is made for changes in the purchasing power of the monetary unit, and (2) the accrued rather than the realized cap- ital gain is considered. In fact, whenever businesses are owned by stockholders (and bondholders), the gains on these stocks and bonds will provide a fuller guide to income earned than the actual net income of the firm. If it is desired to tax incomes uni- formly, then taxes would have to be levied on the former only ; to tax both would be to level a “double” tax on the same income. Professor Groves, while agreeing that capital gains are income, lists several reasons for giving capital gains preferential treatment. 30 Almost all of them apply, however, to taxation on realized , rather than on accrued , capital gains. The only relevant case is the familiar one that “capital gains and losses are not reg- ularly recurrent, as are most other incomes.” But no income is “regularly recurrent.” Profits and losses, of course, are volatile, being based on speculative entrepreneurship and adjustments to changing conditions. Yet no one contends that profits are not income. All other income is flexible as well. No one has a guar- anteed income on the free market. Everyone’s resources are subject to change as conditions and the data of the market change. That the division between income and capital gains is illusory is demonstrated by the confusion over the classification of authors’ incomes. Is the income in one year resulting from five years’ writing of a book “income” or an increase in the “capital worth” of the author? It should be evident that this entire distinction is valueless. 31 Binary Intervention: Taxation 133 of income in kind, however, there may also be taxes on accrued capital gains. 30 Harold M. Groves, Financing Government (New York: Henry Holt, 1939), p. 181. 31 Irregular income poses the same problem as irregular realized cap- ital gain. The difficulty can be met in both cases by the suggested solu- tion of averaging income over several years and paying taxes annually on the average."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Capital gains are profits. And the real value of aggregate cap- ital gains in society will equal total aggregate profits. A profit increases the capital worth of the owner, whereas a loss decreases it. Moreover, there are no other sources from which real capital gains can come. What of the savings of individuals? Individual savings, to the extent that they do not add to cash balances, go into investments. These purchases of capital lead to capital gains for stockholders. Aggregate savings lead to aggre- gate capital gains. But it is also true that profits can exist in the aggregate only when there is aggregate net saving in the econ- omy. Thus, aggregate pure profits, aggregate capital gains, and aggregate net savings all go hand in hand in the economy. Net dissavings lead to aggregate pure losses and aggregate capital losses. To sum up, if it is desired to tax uniformly (this goal will be analyzed critically below), the correct procedure would be to consider capital gains as equivalent to income when corrected for changes in the purchasing power of the monetary unit, and to consider capital losses as negative income. Some critics charge that it would be discriminatory to correct capital for changes in prices without doing the same for income, but this objection misses the point. If the desire is to tax income rather than accu- mulated capital, it is necessary to correct for changes in the pur- chasing power of money. For example, capital rather than pure income is being taxed during an inflation. (5) Is a Tax on Consumption Possible? We have seen that attempts to tax consumption via sales and excise taxes are vain and that they inexorably result in a tax on incomes. Irving Fisher has suggested an ingenious plan for a consumption tax —a direct tax on the individual akin to the income tax, requiring annual returns, etc. The base for the indi- vidual’s tax, however, would be his income, minus net additions to his capital or cash balance, plus net subtractions from that capital for the period—i.e., his consumption spending. The individual’s consumption spending would then be taxed in the 134 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"same way as his income is now. 32 We have seen the fallacy in the Fisher argument that only a tax on consumption would be a true income tax and that the ordinary income tax constitutes a dou- ble tax on savings. This argument places greater weight on sav- ings than the market does, since the market knows all about the fructifying power of saving and allocates its expenditures accordingly. The problem we have to face here is this: Would such a tax as Fisher proposes actually have the intended effect— would it tax consumption only? Let us consider a Mr. Jones, with a yearly income of 100 gold ounces. During the year, he spends 90 percent, or 90 ounces, on consumption and saves 10 percent, or 10 ounces. If the govern- ment imposes a 20-percent income tax upon him, he must pay 20 ounces at the end of the year. Assuming that his time-pref- erence schedule remains the same (and setting aside the fact that there will be an increased proportion spent on consump- tion because an individual with fewer money assets has a higher time-preference rate ), the ratio of his consumption to invest- ment will still be 90:10. Jones will now spend 72 ounces on con- sumption and eight on investment. Now, suppose that instead of an income tax, the government levies a 20-percent annual tax on consumption. Fisher main- tained that such a tax would be levied only on consumption. But this is incorrect, since savings-investment is based solely on the possibility of future consumption. Since future con- sumption will also be taxed, in equilibrium, at the same rate as present consumption, it is evident that saving does not receive any special encouragement. 33 Even if it were desirable for the government to encourage saving at the expense of consump- tion, taxing consumption would not do so. Since future and Binary Intervention: Taxation 135 32 Fisher and Fisher, Constructive Income Taxation , passim . 33 Neither does hoarding receive any special encouragement, since hoarding must finally eventuate in consumption. It is true that keeping cash balances itself yields a benefit, but the basis for such balances is always the prospect of future consumption."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"present consumption will be taxed equally, there will be no shift in favor of savings. In fact, there will be a shift in favor of con- sumption to the extent that a diminished amount of money causes an increase in the rate of preference for present goods. Setting aside this shift, his loss of funds will cause him to reallocate and reduce his savings as well as his consumption. Any payment of funds to the government necessarily reduces the net income remaining to him, and, since his time preference remains the same, he reduces his savings and his consumption proportion- ately. It will help to see how this works arithmetically. We may use the following simple equation to sum up Jones’ position: (1) Net Income = Gross Income – Tax (2) Consumption = .90 Net Income (3) Tax = .20 Consumption With Gross Income equal to 100, and solving for these three equations, we get this result: Net Income = 85, Tax = 15, Con- sumption = 76. We may now sum up in the following tabulation what happened to Jones under an income tax and under a consumption tax: Gross Net Savings Event Income Tax Income Consumption Investment 20% Income 100 20 80 72 8 Ta x 20% Consump- 100 15 85 76 9 tion Tax We thus see this important truth: A consumption tax is always shifted so as to become an income tax, though at a lower rate. In fact, the 20-percent consumption tax becomes equivalent to 136 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Binary Intervention: Taxation 137 a 15-percent income tax. This is a very important argument against the plan. Fisher’s attempt to tax consumption alone must fail; the tax is shifted by the individual until it becomes an income tax, albeit at a lower rate than the equivalent income tax. Thus, the rather startling conclusion is reached in our analy- sis that there can be no tax on consumption alone ; all consumption taxes resolve themselves in one way or another into taxes on incomes. Of course, as is true of the direct consumption tax, the effect of the rate is discounted . And here perhaps lies a clue to the relative predilection that free-market economists have shown toward consumption taxes. Their charm, in the final analysis, consists in the discounting—in the fact that the same rate in a consumption tax has the effect of a lower rate of income tax. The tax burden on society and the market is lower. 34 This reduction of the tax burden may be a very commendable objective, but it should be stated as such, and it should be realized that the prob- lem lies not so much in the type of tax levied as in the over-all burden of taxes on individuals in the society. We must now modify our conclusions by admitting the case of dishoarding or dissaving , which we had ruled out of the dis- cussion. To the extent that dishoarding occurs, consumption is tapped rather than income, for the dissaver consumes out of pre- viously accumulated wealth, and not out of current income. The Fisher tax would thus tap spending out of accumulated wealth, which would remain untaxed by ordinary income taxation. 4. The Incidence and Effects of Taxation Part II: Taxes on Accumulated Capital In a sense, all taxes are taxes on capital. In order to pay a tax, a man must save the money. This is a universal rule. If the saving 34 In the same way, the charm of the sales tax lies in the fact that it can- not be progressive, thus reducing the burden of income taxation on the upper groups."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"took place in advance, then the tax reduces the capital invested in the society. If the saving did not take place in advance, then we may say that the tax reduced potential saving. Potential sav- ing is hardly the same as accumulated capital, however, and we may therefore consider a tax on current income as separate from a tax on capital. Even if the individual were forced to save to pay the tax, the saving is current just as the income is current, and therefore we may make the distinction between taxes on current saving and current incomes, and taxes on accumulated capital from past periods. In fact, since there can be no consumption taxes, except where there is dissaving, almost all taxes resolve themselves into income taxes or taxes on accumulated capital. We have already analyzed the effect of an income tax. We come now to taxes on accumulated capital. Here we encounter a genuine case of “double taxation.” When current savings are taxed, the charge of double taxation is a dubious one, since people are allocating their newly produced current income. Accumulated capital, on the contrary, is our heritage from the past; it is the accumulation of tools and equip- ment and resources from which our present and future standard of living derive. To tax this capital is to reduce the stock of cap- ital, especially to discourage replacements as well as new accu- mulations, and to impoverish society in the future. It may well happen that time preferences on the market will dictate volun- tary capital consumption. In that case, people will deliberately choose to impoverish themselves in the future so as to live bet- ter in the present. But when the government compels such a result, the distortion of market choices is particularly severe. For the standard of living of everyone in the society will be absolutely lowered, and this includes perhaps some of the tax consumers—the government officials and the other recipients of tax privilege. Instead of living off present productive income, the government and its favorites are now dipping into the accu- mulated capital of society, thereby killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 138 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Taxation of capital, therefore, differs considerably from income taxation; here the type matters as well as the level. A 20- percent tax on accumulated capital will have a far more devas- tating, distorting, and impoverishing effect than a 20-percent tax on income. A. T AXATION ON G RATUITOUS T RANSFERS : B EQUESTS AND G IFTS The receipt of gifts has often been considered simple income. It should be obvious, however, that the recipient pro- duced nothing in exchange for the money received; in fact, it is not an income from current production at all, but a transfer of ownership of accumulated capital. Any tax on the receipt of gifts, then, is a tax on capital. This is particularly true of inheri- tances , where the aggregation of capital is shifted to an heir, and the gift clearly does not come from current income. An inheri- tance tax, therefore, is a pure tax on capital. Its impact is partic- ularly devastating because ( a ) large sums will be involved, since at some point within a few generations every piece of property must pass to heirs, and ( b ) the prospect of an inheritance tax destroys the incentive and the power to save and build up a fam- ily competence. The inheritance tax is perhaps the most devas- tating example of a pure tax on capital. A tax on gifts and bequests has the further effect of penaliz- ing charity and the preservation of family ties. It is ironic that some of those most ardent in advocating taxation of gifts and bequests are the first to assert that there would never be “enough” charity were the free market left to its own devices. B. P ROPERTY T AXATION A property tax is a tax levied on the value of property and hence on accumulated capital. There are many problems pecu- liar to property taxation. In the first place, the tax depends on an assessment of the value of property, and the rate of tax is applied to this assessed value. But since an actual sale of property has Binary Intervention: Taxation 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"usually not taken place, there is no way for assessments to be made accurately. Since all assessments are arbitrary, the road is open for favoritism, collusion, and bribery in making them. Another weakness of current property taxation is that it taxes doubly both “real” and “intangible” property. The property tax adds “real” and “intangible” property assessments together; thus, the bondholders’ equity in property is added to the amount of the debtors’ liability. Property under debt is therefore doubly taxed as against other property. If A and B each own a piece of property worth $10,000, but C also holds a bond worth $6,000 on B’s property, the latter is assessed at a total of $16,000 and taxed accordingly. 35 Thus, the use of the credit system is penal- ized, and the rate of interest paid to creditors must be raised to allow for the extra penalty. One peculiarity of the property tax is that it attaches to the property itself rather than to the person who owns it. As a result, the tax is shifted on the market in a special way known as tax capitalization. Suppose, for example, that the social time-prefer- ence rate, or pure rate of interest, is 5 percent. Five percent is earned on all investments in equilibrium, and the rate tends to 5 percent as equilibrium is reached. Suppose a property tax is levied on one particular property or set of properties, e.g., on a house worth $10,000. Before this tax was imposed, the owner earned $500 annually on the property. An annual tax of 1 per- cent is now levied, forcing the owner to pay $100 per year to the government. What will happen now? As it stands, the owner will earn $400 per year on his investment. The net return on the investment will now be 4 percent. Clearly, no one will continue to invest at 4 percent in this property when he can earn 5 per- cent elsewhere. What will happen? The owner will not be able to shift his tax forward by raising the rental value of the prop- erty. The property’s earnings are determined by its discounted marginal value productivity, and the tax on the property does 140 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 35 See Groves, Financing Government , p. 64."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Binary Intervention: Taxation 141 not increase its merits or earning power. In fact, the reverse occurs: the tax lowers the capital value of the property to enable owners to earn a 5-percent return. The market drive toward uniformity of interest return pushes the capital value of the property down to enable a return on investment. The capital value of the property will fall to $8,333, so that future returns will be 5 percent. 36 In the long run, this process of reducing capital value is imputed backward, falling mainly on the owners of ground land. Suppose a property tax is levied on a capital good or a set of capital goods. Income to a capital good is resolvable into wages, interest, profit, and rental to ground land. A lower capi- tal value of capital goods would shift resources elsewhere; work- ers, confronted with lower wages in producing this particular good, would shift to a better-paying job; capitalists would invest 36 The final capital value is not $8,000, since the property tax is levied at 1 percent of the final value. The tax does not remain at 1 percent of the original capital value of $10,000. The capital value will fall to $8,333. Property tax payment will be $83, net annual return will be $417, and an annual rate of return of 5 percent on the capital of $8,333. The algebraic formula for arriving at this result is as follows: If C is the capital value to be determined, i is the rate of interest, and R the annual rent from the property, then, when no tax enters into the picture: iC = R When a property tax is levied, then the net return is the rent minus the annual tax liability, T , or: iC = R – T In this property tax, we postulate a fixed rate on the value of the property, so that: iC = R – tC, where t equals the tax rate on the value of the property. Transposing, C = R / i + t ; the new capital value equals the annual rent divided by the interest rate plus the tax rate. Consequently, the capital value is driven down below its original sum, the higher are ( a ) the inter- est rate and ( b ) the tax rate."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"in a more remunerative field; and so forth. As a result, workers and entrepreneurs would largely be able to slough off the bur- den of the property tax, the former suffering to the extent that their original DMVP was higher here than in the next-highest- paying occupations. Consumers would, of course, suffer from a coerced misallocation of resources. The man bearing the major burden, then, is the owner of ground land; therefore, the process of tax capitalization applies most fully to a property tax upon ground land. The incidence falls on the owner of the “original” ground land, i.e., the owner at the time the tax is first imposed. For not only does the landlord pay the annual tax (a tax he cannot shift) so long as he is the owner, but he also suf- fers a loss in capital value. If Mr. Smith is the owner of the above property, not only does he pay $83 per year in taxes, but the capital value of his property also falls from $10,000 to $8,333. Smith openly absorbs the loss when he sells the property. What, however, of the succeeding owners? They buy the property at $8,333 and earn a steady 5-percent interest, although they continue to pay $83 a year to the government. The expectation of the tax payment attached to the property, therefore, has been capitalized by the market and taken into account in arriving at its capital value. As a result, the future owners are able to shift the entire incidence of the property tax to the original owner; they do not really “pay” the tax in the sense that they bear its burden. Tax capitalization is an instance of a process by which the market adjusts to burdens placed upon it. Those whom the gov- ernment wanted to pay the burden can avoid doing so because of the market’s resilience in adjusting to new impositions. The original owners of ground land, however, are especially bur- dened by a property tax. Some writers argue that, where tax capitalization has taken place, it would be unjust for the government to lower or remove the tax because such an action would grant a “free gift” to the current owners of property, who will receive a counterbalancing increase in its capital value. This is a curious argument. It rests 142 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"on a fallacious identification of the removal of a burden with a subsidy . The former, however, is a move toward free-market conditions, whereas the latter is a move away from such condi- tions. Furthermore, the property tax, while not burdening future owners, depresses the capital value of the property below what it would be on the free market, and therefore discourages the employment of resources in this property. Removal of the property tax would reallocate resources to the advantage of the consumers. Tax capitalization and its incidence on owners of ground land occur only where the property tax is partial rather than uni- versal—on some pieces of property rather than all. A truly gen- eral property tax will reduce the rate of income earned from all investments and thereby reduce the rate of interest instead of the capital value. In that case, the interest return of both the original owner and later owners is reduced equally, and there is no extra burden on the original owner. A general, uniform property tax on all property values, then, will, like an income tax, reduce the interest return throughout the economy. This will penalize saving, thereby reducing capi- tal investment below what it would have been and depressing real wage rates further below their free-market level. 37 Finally, a property tax necessarily distorts the allocation of resources in production. It penalizes those lines of production in which capital equipment per sales dollar is large and causes resources to shift from these to less “capitalistic” fields. Thus, investment in higher-order productive processes is discouraged, and the standard of living lowered. Individuals will invest less in housing, which bears a relatively heavy property tax burden, and shift instead to less durable consumers’ goods, thus distort- ing production and injuring consumer satisfaction. In practice, the property tax tends to be uneven from one line and location Binary Intervention: Taxation 143 37 On tax-capitalization, see Seligman, Shifting and Incidence of Taxation , pp. 181–85, 261–64.

Of course, geographic differences in property taxa- tion, in impelling resources to escape heavy tax rates, 38 will dis- tort the location of production by driving it from those areas that would maximize consumer satisfaction. C. A T AX ON I NDIVIDUAL W EALTH Although a tax on individual wealth has not been tried in practice, it offers an interesting topic for analysis. Such a tax would be imposed on individuals instead of on their property and would levy a certain percentage of their total net wealth, excluding liabilities. In its directness, it would be similar to the income tax and to Fisher’s proposed consumption tax. A tax of this kind would constitute a pure tax on capital, and would include in its grasp cash balances, which escape property taxa- tion. It would avoid many difficulties of a property tax, such as double taxation of real and tangible property and the inclusion of debts as property. However, it would still face the impossibil- ity of accurately assessing property values. A tax on individual wealth could not be capitalized, since the tax would not be attached to a property, where it could be dis- counted by the market. Like an individual income tax, it could not be shifted , although it would have important effects . Since the tax would be paid out of regular income, it would have the effect of an income tax in reducing private funds and penalizing sav- ings-investment; but it would also have the further effect of tax- ing accumulated capital. How much accumulated capital would be taken by the tax depends on the concrete data and the valuations of the specific individuals. Let us postulate, for example, two individuals: 144 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 38 This distortion of location would result from all other forms of taxes as well. Thus, a higher income-tax rate in region A than in region B would induce workers to shift from A to B, in order to equalize net wage rates after taxes. The location of production is distorted as compared with the free market."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Smith and Robinson. Each has an accumulated wealth of $100,000. Smith, however, also earns $50,000 a year, and Robinson (because of retirement or other reasons) earns only $1,000 a year. Suppose the government levies a 10-percent annual tax on an individual’s wealth. Smith might be able to pay the $10,000 a year out of his regular income, without reducing his accumulated wealth, although it seems clear that, since his tax liability is reduced thereby, he will want to reduce his wealth as much as possible. Robinson, on the other hand, must pay the tax by selling his assets, thereby reducing his accumulated wealth. It is clear that the wealth tax levies a heavy penalty on accu- mulated wealth and that therefore the effect of the tax will be to slash accumulated capital. No quicker route could be found to promote capital consumption and general impoverishment than to penalize the accumulation of capital. Only our heritage of accumulated capital differentiates our civilization and living standards from those of primitive man, and a tax on wealth would speedily work to eliminate this difference. The fact that a wealth tax could not be capitalized means that the market could not, as in the case of the property tax, reduce and cushion its effect after the impact of the initial blow. 5. The Incidence and Effects of Taxation Part III: The Progressive Tax Of all the patterns of tax distribution, the progressive tax has generated the most controversy. In the case of the progressive tax, the conservative economists who oppose it have taken the offensive, for even its advocates must grudgingly admit that the progressive tax lowers incentives and productivity. Hence, the most ardent champions of the progressive tax on “equity” grounds admit that the degree and intensity of progression must be limited by considerations of productivity. The major criticisms that have been leveled against progressive taxation Binary Intervention: Taxation 145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"are: ( a ) it reduces the savings of the community; ( b ) it reduces the incentive to work and earn; and ( c ) it constitutes “robbery of the rich by the poor.” To evaluate these criticisms, let us turn to an analysis of the effects of the progression principle. The progressive tax imposes a higher rate of taxation on a man earning more. In other words, it acts as a penalty on service to the consumer, on merit in the market. Incomes in the market are determined by service to the consumer in producing and allocating factors of production and vary directly according to the extent of such services. To impose penalties on the very people who have served the consumers most is to injure not only them, but the consumers as well. A progressive tax is therefore bound to crip- ple incentives, impair mobility of occupation, and greatly ham- per the flexibility of the market in serving the consumers. It will consequently lower the general standard of living. The ultimate of progression—coercively equalized incomes—will, as we have seen, cause a reversion to barbarism. There is also no question that progressive income taxation will reduce incentives to save, because people will not earn the return on investment conso- nant with their time preferences; their earnings will be taxed away. Since people will earn far less than their time preferences would warrant, their savings will be depressed far below what they would be on the free market. Thus, conservatives’ charges that the progressive tax reduces incentives to work and save are correct and, in fact, are usually understated, because there is not sufficient realization that these effects stem a priori from the very nature of progression itself. It should not be forgotten, however, that proportional taxation will induce many of the same effects as, in fact, will any tax that goes beyond equality or the cost principle. For proportional taxation also penalizes the able and the saver. It is true that proportional taxation will not have many of the crippling effects of progres- sion, such as the progressive hampering of effort from one income bracket to another. But proportional taxation also 146 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"imposes heavier burdens as the income brackets rise, and these also hamper earning and saving. A second argument against the progressive income tax, and one which is perhaps the most widely used, is that, by taxing the incomes of the wealthy, it reduces savings in particular, thus injuring society as a whole. This argument is predicated on the usually plausible assumption that the rich save more propor- tionately than the poor. Yet, as we have indicated above, this is an extremely weak argument, particularly for partisans of the free market. It is legitimate to criticize a measure for forcing deviations from free-market allocations to arbitrary ones; but it can hardly be legitimate simply to criticize a measure for reduc- ing savings per se . For why does consumption possess less merit than saving? Allocation between them on the market is simply a matter of time preference. This means that any coerced devia- tion from the market ratio of saving to consumption imposes a loss in utility, and this is true whichever direction the deviation takes. A government measure that might induce more saving and less consumption is then no less subject to criticism than one that would lead to more consumption and less saving. To say differently is to criticize free-market choices and implicitly to advocate governmental measures to force more savings upon the public. If they were consistent, therefore, these conservative economists would have to advocate taxation of the poor to sub- sidize the rich, for in that case savings would presumably increase and consumption diminish. The third objection is a political-ethical one—that “the poor rob the rich.” The implication is that the poor man who pays 1 percent of his income in taxes is “robbing” the rich man who pays 80 percent. Without judging the merits or demerits of rob- bery, we may say that this is invalid. Both citizens are being robbed—by the State. That one is robbed in greater proportion does not eliminate the fact that both are being injured. It may be objected that the poor receive a net subsidy out of the tax proceeds because the government spends money to serve the Binary Intervention: Taxation 147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"poor. Yet this is not a valid argument. For the actual act of rob- bery is committed by the State, and not by the poor. Secondly, the State may spend its money, as we shall see below, on many different projects. It may consume products; it may subsidize some or all of the rich; it may subsidize some or all of the poor. The fact of progressive income taxation does not itself imply that “the poor” en masse will be subsidized. If some of the poor are subsidized, others may not be, and these latter will still be net taxpayers rather than tax-consumers and will be “robbed” along with the rich. The extent of this deprivation will be less for a poor taxpayer than for a rich one; and yet, since usually there are far more poor than rich, the poor en masse may very well bear the greatest burden of the tax “robbery.” In contrast, the State bureaucracy, as we have seen, actually pays no taxes at all. 39 This misconception of the incidence of “robbery,” and the defective argument on savings, among other reasons, have led most conservative economists and writers to overemphasize greatly the importance of the progressiveness of taxation. Actu- ally, the level of taxation is far more important than its progres- siveness in determining the distance that a society has traveled from a free market. An example will clarify the relative impor- tance of the two. Let us contrast two people and see how they fare under two different tax systems. Smith makes $1,000 a year, and Jones makes $20,000 a year. In Society A taxation is pro- portionate for all at 50 percent. In Society B taxation is very steeply progressive: rates are ½ percent for $1,000 income, 20 percent for $20,000 income. The following tabulation shows how much money each will pay in taxes in the different soci- eties: 148 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 39 On the extent to which the lower-income classes actually pay taxes in present-day America, see Gabriel Kolko, Wealth and Power in America (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1962), chap. 2."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Society A B Smith ($1,000) . . . . . . . $ 500 $ 5 Jones ($20,000) . . . . . . $10,000 $4,000 Now, we may ask both the rich and the poor taxpayers: Under which system of taxation are you better off? Both the rich man and the poor man will unhesitatingly pick Society B, where the rate structure is far more progressive, but where the level of tax- ation for every man is lower. Some may object that the total amount of tax levied is far greater in Society A. But this is pre- cisely the point! The point is that what the rich man objects to is not the progressiveness of the rates, but the high level of the rates imposed upon him, and he will prefer progressiveness when rates are lower. This demonstrates that it is not the poor who “rob” the rich through the progressive principle of taxation; it is the State that “robs” both through all taxation. And it indi- cates that what the conservative economists are actually object- ing to, whether they fully realize it or not, is not progression, but high levels of taxation, and that their real objection to pro- gression is that it opens the sluice gates for high levels of taxation of the rich. Yet this prospect will not always be realized. For it is certainly possible and has often occurred that a rate structure is very progressive and yet lower all around, on the high brack- ets and on the low, than a less progressive structure. As a prac- tical matter, however, progressiveness is necessary for high tax rates, because the multitude of lower-income citizens might revolt against very steep tax rates if they were imposed on all equally. On the other hand, many people may accept a high tax burden if they are secure in the knowledge or belief that the rich pay a still higher rate. 40 We have seen that coerced egalitarianism will cause a rever- sion to barbarism and that steps in that direction will result in Binary Intervention: Taxation 149 40 Cf., Bertrand de Jouvenel, The Ethics of Redistribution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"dislocations of the market and a lowering of living standards. Many economists—notably the members of the “Chicago School”—believe that they champion the “free market,” and yet they do not consider taxation as connected with the market or as an intervention in the market process. These writers strongly believe that, on the market, every individual should earn the profits and marginal value productivity that the consumers wish to pay, in order to achieve a satisfactory allocation of productive factors. Nevertheless, they see no inconsistency in then advo- cating drastic taxation and subsidies. They believe that these can alter the “distribution” of incomes without lowering the efficiency of productive allocations. In this way they rely on an equivalent of Keynesian “money illusion”—a tax illusion , a belief that individuals will arrange their activities according to their gross rather than net (after-tax) income. This is a palpable error. There is no reason why people should not be tax-conscious and allocate their resources and energies accordingly. Altering rela- tive rewards by taxation will disrupt all the allocations of the market—the movement of labor, the alertness of entrepreneur- ship, etc. The market is a vast nexus, with all strands intercon- nected, and it must be analyzed as such. The prevailing fashion in economics of chopping up the market into isolated compart- ments—“the firm,” a few “macroscopic” holistic aggregates, market exchanges, taxation, etc.—distorts the discussion of each one of these compartments and fails to present a true picture of the interrelations of the market. 6. The Incidence and Effects of Taxation Part IV: The “Single Tax” on Ground Rent We have refuted elsewhere the various arguments that form part of the Henry Georgist edifice: the idea that “society” owns the land originally and that every new baby has a “right” to an aliquot part; the moral argument that an increase in the value of ground land is an “unearned increment” due to external causes; and the doctrine that “speculation” in sites wickedly withholds 150 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"productive land from use. Here we shall analyze the famous Georgist proposal itself: the “single tax,” or the 100-percent expropriation of ground rent. 41 One of the first things to be said about the Georgist theory is that it calls attention to an important problem—the land question. Current economics tends to treat land as part of cap- ital and to deny the existence of a separate land category at all. In such an environment, the Georgist thesis serves to call atten- tion to a neglected problem, even though every one of its doc- trines is fallacious. Much of the discussion of ground-rent taxation has been confused by the undoubted stimulus to production that would result, not from this tax, but from the elimination of all other forms of taxation. George waxed eloquent over the harmful effect taxation has upon production and exchange. However, these effects can as easily be removed by eliminating taxation altogether as by shifting all taxes onto ground rent. 42 In fact, it will here be Binary Intervention: Taxation 151 41 See Murray N. Rothbard, The Single Tax: Economic and Moral Impli- cations (Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Educa- tion, 1957); also idem , A Reply to Georgist Criticisms (mimeographed MS., Foundation for Economic Education, 1957). 42 George virtually admitted as much: To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting now hampers every wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation . . . operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities. If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have been contented to live in a hovel, the tax-gatherer now comes annually to make me pay a penalty for my energy and my industry, by tax- ing me more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"am mulct, while you are exempt. . . . We say we want cap- ital, but if anyone accumulate it, or bring it among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving a privilege. . . . To abolish these taxes would be to lift the enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. . . . Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, “The more you add to the general wealth, the more shall you be taxed!” the state would say to the producer, “Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward . . . you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.” (Henry George, Progress and Poverty [New York: Modern Library, 1929], pp. 434–35) demonstrated that taxation of ground rent also hampers and distorts production. Whatever beneficial effects the single tax might have on production would flow only from the elimination of other taxes, not from the imposition of this one. The two acts must be kept conceptually distinct. A tax on ground rent would have the effect of a property tax as described above, i.e., it could not be shifted, and it would be “capitalized,” with the initial burden falling on the original owner, and later owners escaping any burden because of the fall in the capital value of the ground land. The Georgists propose to place a 100-percent annual tax on ground rents alone. One critical problem that the single tax could not meet is the difficulty of estimating ground rents. The essence of the single tax scheme is to tax ground rent only and to leave all capital goods free from tax. But it is impossible to make this division. Georgists have dismissed this difficulty as merely a practical one; but it is a theoretical flaw as well. As is true of any property tax, it is impossible accurately to assess value, because the prop- erty has not been actually sold on the market during the period. Ground-land taxation faces a further problem that cannot be solved: how to distinguish quantitatively between that portion of the gross rent of a land area which goes to ground land and that portion which goes to interest and to wages. Since land in 152 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"use is often amalgamated with capital investment and the two are bought and sold together, this distinction between them cannot be made. But the Georgist theory faces even graver difficulties. For its proponents contend that the positive virtue of the tax consists in spurring production. They point out to hostile critics that the single tax (if it could be accurately levied) would not discourage capital improvements and maintenance of landed property; but then they proceed to argue that the single tax would force idle land into use. This is supposed to be one of the great merits of the tax. Yet if land is idle, it earns no gross rent whatever; if it earns no gross rent, then obviously it earns no net rent as ground land. Idle land earns no rent, and therefore earns no ground rent that could be taxed. It would bear no taxes under a consistent operation of the Georgist scheme! Since it would not be taxed, it could not be forced into use. The only logical explanation for this error by the Georgists is that they concentrate on the fact that much idle land has a capital value, that it sells for a price on the market, even though it earns no rents in current use. From the fact that idle land has a capital value, the Georgists apparently deduce that it must have some sort of “true” annual ground rent. This assumption is incorrect, however, and rests on one of the weakest parts of the Georgists’ system: its deficient attention to the role of time. 43 The fact that currently idle land has a capital value Binary Intervention: Taxation 153 43 George himself can hardly be blamed for the weak treatment of time, for he could draw only on the classical economic theories, which had the same defect. In fact, compared with the classical school, George made advances in many areas of economic theory. The Austrian School, with its definitive analysis of time, was barely beginning when George framed his theory. There is less excuse for George’s modern followers, who have largely ignored all advances in economics since 1880. On George’s contributions, see Leland B. Yeager, “The Methodology of George and Menger,” American Journal of Economics and Sociology, April, 1954, pp. 233–39."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"means simply that the market expects it to earn rent in the future. The capital value of ground land, as of anything else, is equal to and determined by the sum of expected future rents, discounted by the rate of interest. But these are not presently earned rents! Therefore, any taxation of idle land violates the Georgists’ own principle of a single tax on ground rent; it goes beyond this limit to penalize land ownership further and to tax accumulated cap- ital, which has to be drawn down in order to pay the tax. Any increas e in the capital value of idle land, then, does not reflect a current rent; it merely reflects an upgrading of people’s expectations about future rents. Suppose, for example, that future rents from an idle site are such that, if known to all, the present capital value of the site would be $10,000. Suppose fur- ther that these facts are not generally known and, therefore, that the ruling price is $8,000. Jones, being a farsighted entre- preneur, correctly judges the situation and purchases the site for $8,000. If everyone soon realizes what Jones has foreseen, the market price will now rise to $10,000. Jones’ capital gain of $2,000 is the profit to his superior judgment, not earnings from current rate. The Georgist bogey is idle land. The fact that land is idle, they assert, is caused by “land speculation,” and to this land spec- ulation they attribute almost all the ills of civilization, including business-cycle depressions. The Georgists do not realize that, since labor is scarce in relation to land, submarginal land must remain idle. The sight of idle land enrages the Georgist, who sees productive capacity being wasted and living standards reduced. Idle land should, however, be recognized as beneficial, for, if land were ever fully used this would mean that labor had become abundant in relation to land and that the world had at last entered on the terrible overpopulation stage in which some labor has to remain idle because no employment is available. The present writer used to wonder about the curious Geor- gist preoccupation with idle, or “withheld,” ground land as the cause of most economic ills until he found a clue in a revealing passage of a Georgist work: 154 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"“Poor” Countries Do Not Lack Capital. Most of us have learned to believe that the people of India, China, Mexico, and other so-called backward nations are poor because they lack capital. Since, as we have seen, capital is nothing more than wealth, and wealth nothing more than human energy com- bined with land in one form or another, the absence of capital too often suggests that there is a shortage of land or of labor in backward countries like India and China. But that isn’t true. For these “poor” countries have many times more land and labor than they use. . . . Undeniably, they have everything it takes—both land and labor—to produce as much capital as people anywhere. 44 And so, since these poor countries have plenty of land and labor, it follows that landlords must be withholding land from use. Only this could explain the low living standards. Here a crucial Georgist fallacy is exposed clearly: ignorance of the true role of time in production. It takes time to save and invest and build up capital goods, and these capital goods embody a shortening of the ultimate time period needed to acquire consumers’ goods. India and China are short of capital because they are short of time. They start from a low level of capital, and therefore it would take them a long time to reach a high capital level through their own savings. Once again, the Georgist difficulty stems from the fact that their theory was formulated before the rise of “Austrian” economics and that the Georgists have never reevaluated their doctrine in the light of this development. 45 Binary Intervention: Taxation 155 44 Phil Grant, The Wonderful Wealth Machine (New York: Devin-Adair, 1953), pp 105–07. 45 For a critique of George’s peculiar theory of interest, see Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Capital and Interest (New York: Brentano’s, 1922), pp. 413–20, especially p. 418 on the capitalization of idle land."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"As we have indicated earlier, land speculation performs a useful social function. It puts land into the hands of the most knowledgeable and develops land at the rate desired by the con- sumers.

The allocation of sites to their most value-productive uses, therefore, requires all the virtues of any type of entrepreneurship on the market. 46 One of the most surprising deficiencies in the literature of economics is the lack of effective criticism of the Georgist the- ory. Economists have either temporized, misconceived the problem, or, in many cases, granted the economic merit of the theory but cavilled at its political implications or its practical difficulties. Such gentle treatment has contributed greatly to the persistent longevity of the Georgist movement. One reason for this weakness in the criticism of the doctrine is that most econ- omists have conceded a crucial point of the Georgists, namely, that a tax on ground rent would not discourage production and would have no harmful or distorting economic effects. Grant- ing the economic merits of the tax, criticism of it must fall back 156 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 46 See Frank Knight: Men do hold land “speculatively” for an expected increase in value.

They obviously do not need to keep it idle to get the increase, and do not, if there is a clear opening for remunerative use. . . . If land having value for use is not used by an owner, it is because of uncertainty as to how it should be used, and waiting for the situation to clear up or develop. An owner naturally does not wish to make a heavy invest- ment in fitting a plot for use which does not promise amortization before some new situation may require a different plan. (Frank H.

Many writers, while balking at the difficulties in the full single-tax program, have advocated the 100-percent taxation of future increments in ground rent. Georgists have properly treated such halfway measures with scorn. Once the opposition concedes the eco- nomic harmlessness of a ground-rent tax, its other doubts must seem relatively minor. The crucial economic problem of the single tax, then, is this: Will a tax on ground rent have distortive and hampering effects? Is it true that the owner of ground land performs no productive service and, therefore, that a tax upon him does not hamper and distort production? Ground rent has been called “economic surplus,” which would be taxed up to any amount with no side effects. Many economists have tacitly agreed with this conclusion and have agreed that a landowner can perform a productive service only as an improver, i.e., as a producer of capital goods on land. Yet this central Georgist contention overlooks the realities. The owner of ground land performs a very important produc- tive service. He brings sites into use and allocates them to the most value-productive bidders. We must not be misled by the fact that the physical stock of land is fixed at any given time. In the case of land, as of other goods, it is not just the physical good that is sold, but a whole bundle of services along with it— among which is the service of transferring ownership from seller to buyer. Ground land does not simply exist; it must be served to the user by the owner.

In particular, we must not overlook the importance of location and the productive service of the site owner in insuring the most productive locations for each par- ticular use. The view that bringing sites into use and deciding on their location is not really “productive” is a vestige of the old classi- cal view that a service which does not tangibly “create” some- thing physical is not “really” productive. 48 Actually, this func- tion is just as productive as any other, and a particularly vital function it is. To hamper and destroy this function would have grave effects on the economy. Suppose that the government did in fact levy a 100-percent tax on ground rent. What would be the economic effects? The current owners of ground land would be expropriated, and the capital value of ground land would fall to zero. Since site owners could not obtain rents, the sites would become valueless on the market.

He rules out all cre- ation of values by the services performed in [land] distri- bution by free contract and exchange, which is the sole alternative to either a violent and disorderly or an arbi- trary and tyrannical distribution of land.

So, one eco- nomic effect of the single tax is that, far from supplying all the revenue of government, it would yield no revenue at all! The single tax, then, makes sites free when they are actually not free and unlimited, but scarce. Any good is always scarce and therefore must always command a price in accordance with the demand for it and the supply available. The only “free goods” on the market are not goods at all, but abundant conditions of human welfare that are not the subject of human action. The effect of this tax, then, is to fool the market into believ- ing that sites are free when they are decidedly not. The result will be the same as any case of maximum price control. Instead of commanding a high price and therefore being allocated to the highest bidders, the most value-productive sites will be grabbed by first comers and wasted, since there will be no pres- sure for the best sites to go into their most efficient uses. Peo- ple will rush in to demand and use the best sites, while no one will wish to use the less productive ones. On the free market, the less productive sites cost less to the tenant; if they cost no less than the best sites (i.e., if they are free), then no one will want to use them. Thus, in a city, the best, or most potentially value-productive, sites are in the “downtown” areas, and these consequently earn and charge higher rents than the less pro- ductive but still useful sites in the outlying areas. If the Henry George scheme went into effect, there would not only be com- plete misallocation of sites to less productive uses, but there would also be great overcrowding in the downtown areas, as well as underpopulation and underuse of the outlying areas. If Georgists believe that the single tax would end overcrowding of the downtown areas, they are gravely mistaken, for the reverse would occur. Furthermore, suppose the government imposed a tax of more than 100 percent on ground rents, as the Georgists really envi- sion, so as to force “idle” land into use. The result would be aggravated wasteful misapplication of labor and capital. Since Binary Intervention: Taxation 159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"labor is scarce relative to land, the compulsory use of idle land would wastefully misallocate labor and capital and force more work on poorer land, and therefore less on better land. At any rate, the result of the single tax would be locational chaos, with waste and misallocation everywhere; overcrowding would prevail; and poorer sites would either be overused or underused and abandoned altogether. The general tendency would be toward underuse of the poorer sites because of the tax- induced rush to the better ones. As under conditions of price control, the use of the better sites would be decided by favoritism, queuing, etc., instead of economic ability. Since location enters into the production of every good, locational chaos would introduce an element of chaos into every area of production and perhaps ruin economic calculation as well, for an important element to be calculated—location—would be removed from the sphere of the market. To this contention, the Georgists would reply that the own- ers would not be allowed to charge no rents, because the gov- ernment’s army of assessors would set the proper rents. But this would hardly alleviate the problem; in fact, it would aggravate matters in many ways. It might bring in revenue and check some of the excess demand of land users, but it would still pro- vide no reason and no incentive for the land owners to perform their proper function of allocating land sites efficiently. In addi- tion, if assessment is difficult and arbitrary at any time, how very much more chaotic would it be when the government must blindly estimate, in the absence of any rent market, the rent for every piece of ground land! This would be a hopeless and impossible task, and the resulting deviations from free-market rents would compound the chaos, with over- and underuse, and wrong locations. With no vestige of market left, not only would the landowners be deprived of any incentive for efficient alloca- tion of sites; they would have no way of finding out whether their allocations were efficient or not. Finally, this all-around fixing of rents by the government would be tantamount to virtual nationalization of the land, with 160 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"all the enormous wastes and chaos that afflict any government ownership of business—all the greater in a business that would permeate every nook and cranny of the economy. The Geor- gists contend that they do not advocate the nationalization of land, since ownership would remain de jure in the hands of pri- vate individuals. The returns from this ownership, however, would all accrue to the State. George himself admitted that the single tax would “accomplish the same thing [as the land nation- alization] in a simpler, easier, and quieter way.” 49 George’s method, however, would, as we have seen, be neither simple, easy, nor quiet. The single tax would leave de jure ownership in private hands while completely destroying its point, so that the single tax is hardly an improvement upon, or differs much from, outright nationalization. 50 Of course, as we shall see further below, the State has no incentive or means for efficient alloca- tion either. At any rate, land sites, like any other resources, must be owned and controlled by someone, either a private owner or the government. Sites can be allocated either by voluntary con- tract or by governmental coercion, and the latter is what is attempted by the single tax or by land nationalization. 51,52 Binary Intervention: Taxation 161 49 George, Progress and Poverty , p. 404. 50 See Knight: To collect such rent, the government would in practice have to compel the owner actually to use the land in the best way, hence to prescribe its use in some detail.

Caught in an inescapable dilemma are a group of antistatist Georgists, who wish to statize ground rent yet abolish taxation at the same time. Frank Chodorov, a leader of this group, could offer only the lame suggestion that ground land be municipalized rather than nationalized—to avoid the prospect that all of a nation’s land might be owned by a central government monopoly. Yet the difference is one of degree, not of kind; the effects of gov- ernment ownership and regional land monopoly still appear, albeit in a number of small regions instead of one big region. 53 162 Power and Market: Government and the Economy the only possible first party to the contract.

Yet the Georgist doctrines hold a considerable attrac- tion even now, and, surprisingly, for many economists and social philosophers otherwise devoted to the free market. There is a good reason for this attraction, for the Georgists, though in a completely topsy-turvy manner, do call attention to a neglected problem: the land question. There is a land question, and no attempt to ignore it can meet the issue. Contrary to Georgist doctrine, however, the land problem does not stem from free- market ownership of ground land. It stems from failure to live up to a prime condition of free-market property rights, namely, that new, unowned land be first owned by its first user, and that from then on, it become the full private property of the first user or those who receive or buy the land from him. This is the free-market method; any other method of allocating new, unused land to ownership employs statist coercion. Under a “first-user, first-owner” regime, the Georgists would be wrong in asserting that no labor had been mixed with nature- given land to justify private ownership of sites. For then, land could not be owned unless it were first used and could be orig- inally appropriated for ownership only to the extent that it was so used. The “mixing” of labor with nature may take the form of draining, filling, clearing, paving, or otherwise preparing the site for use. Tilling the soil is only one possible type of use. 54 The use-claim to the land could be certified by courts if any dis- pute over its ownership arose. Certainly the claim of the pioneer as first finder and first user is no more disputable than any other claim to a product of labor. Knight does not overdraw the picture when he charges that Binary Intervention: Taxation 163 54 American homestead legislation, while attempting to establish a “first-user, first-owner” principle, erred in believing that a certain type of agriculture was the only legitimate use for land. Actually, any productive activity, including grazing or laying railroad tracks, qualifies as use ."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"the allegation that our pioneers got the land for noth- ing, robbing future generations of their rightful her- itage, should not have to be met by argument. The whole doctrine was invented by city men living in comfort, not by men in contact with the facts as own- ers or renters. . . . If society were later to confiscate the land value, allowing retention only of improvements or their value, it would ignore the costs in bitter sacri- fice and would arbitrarily discriminate between one set of property owners and another set. 55 Problems and difficulties arise whenever the “first-user, first- owner” principle is not met. In almost all countries, governments have laid claim to ownership of new, unused land. Governments could never own original land on the free market. This act of appropriation by the government already sows the seeds for dis- tortion of market allocations when the land goes into use. Thus, suppose that the government disposes of its unused public lands by selling them at auction to the highest bidder. Since the gov- ernment has no valid property claim to ownership, neither does the buyer from the government. If the buyer, as often happens, “owns” but does not use or settle the land, then he becomes a land speculator in a pejorative sense. For the true user, when he comes along, is forced either to rent or buy the land from this speculator, who does not have valid title to the area. He cannot have valid title because his title derives from the State, which also did not have valid title in the free-market sense. Therefore, some of the charges that the Georgists have leveled against land speculation are true, not because land speculation is bad per se , but because the speculator came to own the land, not by valid title, but via the government, which originally arrogated title to itself. So now the purchase price (or, alternatively, the rent) paid by the would-be user really does become the payment of a tax for permission to use the land. Governmental sale of unused land becomes similar to the old practice of tax farming, where 164 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 55 Knight, “Fallacies in the ‘Single Tax,’ ” pp. 809–10."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"an individual would pay the State for the privilege of himself collecting taxes. The price of payment, if freely fluctuating, tends to be set at the value that this privilege confers. Government sale of “its” unused land to speculators, there- fore, restricts the use of new land, distorts the allocation of resources, and keeps land out of use that would be employed were it not for the “tax” penalty of paying a purchase price or rent to the speculator. Keeping land out of use raises the mar- ginal value product and the rents of remaining land and lowers the marginal value product of labor, thereby lowering wage rates. The affinity of rent and taxation is even closer in the case of “feudal” land grants. Let us postulate a typical case of feudal beginnings: a conquering tribe invades a territory of peasants and sets up a State to rule them. It could levy taxes and support its retinue out of the proceeds. But it could also do something else, and it is important to see that there is no essential differ- ence between the two. It could parcel out all of the land as indi- vidual grants of “ownership” to each member of the conquering band. Then, instead of or in addition to one central taxing agency, there would be a series of regional rent collecting agen- cies. But the consequences would be exactly the same. This is clearly seen in Middle Eastern countries, where rulers have been considered to own their territories personally and have therefore collected taxes in the form of “rent” charged for that ownership. The subtle gradations linking taxation and feudal rent have been lucidly portrayed by Franz Oppenheimer: The peasant surrenders a portion of the product of his labor, without any equivalent service in return. “ In the beginning was the ground rent. ” The forms under which the ground rent is collected or consumed vary. In some cases, the lords, as a closed union or community, are settled in some forti- fied camp and consume as communists the tribute of Binary Intervention: Taxation 165"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"their peasantry. . . . In some cases, each individual warrior-noble has a definite strip of land assigned to him: but generally the produce of this is still, as in Sparta, consumed in the “syssitia,” by class associates and companions in arms. In some cases, the landed nobility scatters over the entire territory, each man housed with his following in his fortified castle, and consuming, each for himself, the produce of his dominion or lands. As yet, these nobles have not become landlords, in the sense that they administer their property. Each of them receives tribute from the labor of his dependents, whom he neither guides nor supervises. This is the type of medieval dominion in the lands of the Germanic nobility. Finally, the knight becomes the owner and administrator of the knight’s fee. 56 Of course, there are considerable differences between land speculation by the original buyer from the government and a feudal land grant. In the former case, the user eventually pur- chases the land from the original buyer, and, once he does so, the tax has been fully paid and disappears. From that point on, free- market allocations prevail. Once land gets into the hands of the user, he has, as it were, “bought out” the permission tax, and, from then on, everything proceeds on a free-market basis. 57 In contrast, the feudal lord passes the land on to his heirs. The true owners now have to pay rent where they did not have to pay 166 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 56 Oppenheimer, The State, pp. 83–84. On the breakup of feudal domains into separate substates, see ibid ., pp. 191–202. 57 It must be repeated here that direct users would not be the only ones ever permitted to own land in the free market. The only stipulation is that use be the principle that first brings original, unused land into own- ership . Once ownership accrues to a user, then the user can sell the land to a speculator, let it be idle again, etc., without distorting market alloca- tions. The problem is the original establishment of valid titles to property. After valid titles are established, the owner can, of course, do what he likes with his property."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"before. This rent-tax continues indefinitely. Because of the gen- erally vast extent of the grant, as well as various prohibitory laws, it is most unusual for the feudal lord to be bought out by his ten- ant-subjects. When they do buy out their own plots, however, their land is from then on freed from the permission-tax incubus. One charge often made against the market is that “all” prop- erty can be traced back to coercive depredations or State privi- lege, and therefore there is no need to respect current property rights. Waiving the question of the accuracy of the historical contention, we may state that historical tracings generally make little difference. Suppose, for example, that Jones steals money from Smith or that he acquires the money through State expro- priation and subsidy. And suppose that there is no redress: Smith and his heirs die, and the money continues in Jones’ fam- ily. In that case, the disappearance of Smith and his heirs means the dissolution of claims from the original titleholders at that point, on the “homestead” principle of property right from pos- session of unowned property. The money therefore accrues to the Jones family as their legitimate and absolute property. 58 This process of converting force to service, however, does not work where rent paid for ground land is akin to regional taxation. The effects of speculation in original land disappear as the users purchase the land sites, but dissolution does not take place where feudal land grants are passed on, unbroken, over the generations. As Mises states: Nowhere and at no time has the large-scale owner- ship of land come into being through the working of economic forces in the market. It is the result of mil- itary and political effort. Founded by violence, it has been upheld by violence and by that alone. As soon as the latifundia are drawn into the sphere of market Binary Intervention: Taxation 167 58 Note the assumption that Smith and his heirs die out or cannot be traced.

Neither at their formation nor in their maintenance have economic causes operated. The great landed fortunes did not arise through the economic superiority of large-scale ownership, but through violent annexation outside the area of trade. . . . The non-economic origin of landed fortunes is clearly revealed by the fact that, as a rule, the expro- priation by which they have been created in no way alters the manner of production. The old owner remains on the soil under a different legal title and continues to carry on production. 59 7. Canons of “Justice” in Taxation A. T HE J UST T AX AND THE J UST P RICE For centuries before the science of economics was devel- oped, men searched for criteria of the “just price.” Of all the innumerable, almost infinite possibilities among the myriads of prices daily determined, what pattern should be considered as “just”? Gradually it came to be realized that there is no quanti- tative criterion of justice that can be objectively determined. Suppose that the price of eggs is 50¢ per dozen, what is the “just price”? It is clear, even to those (like the present writer) who believe in the possibility of a rational ethics, that no possible ethical philosophy or science can yield a quantitative measure or criterion of justice. If Professor X says that the “just” price of eggs is 45¢, and Professor Y says it is 85¢, no philosophical principle can decide between them. Even the most fervent antiutilitarian will have to concede this point. The various con- tentions all become purely arbitrary whim. Economics, by tracing the ordered pattern of the voluntary exchange process, has made it clear that the only possible 168 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 59 Ludwig von Mises, Socialism (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1951), p. 375."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"objective criterion for the just price is the market price. For the market price is, at every moment, determined by the voluntary, mutually agreed-upon actions of all the participants in the market. It is the objective resultant of every individual’s subjec- tive valuations and voluntary actions, and is therefore the only existent objective criterion for “quantitative justice” in pricing. Practically nobody now searches explicitly for the “just price,” and it is generally recognized that any ethical criticisms must be leveled qualitatively against the values of consumers, not against the quantitative price-structure that the market establishes on the basis of these values. The market price is the just price, given the pattern of consumer preferences. Further- more, this just price is the concrete, actual market price, not equilibrium price, which can never be established in the real world, nor the “competitive price,” which is an imaginary fig- ment. If the search for the just price has virtually ended in the pages of economic works, why does the quest for a “just tax” continue with unabated vigor? Why do economists, severely scientific in their volumes, suddenly become ad hoc ethicists when the ques- tion of taxation is raised? In no other area of his subject does the economist become more grandiosely ethical. There is no objection at all to discussion of ethical concepts when they are needed, provided that the economist realizes always ( a ) that economics can establish no ethical principles by itself—that it can only furnish existential laws to the ethicist or citizen as data; and ( b ) that any importation of ethics must be grounded on a consistent, coherent set of ethical principles, and not simply be slipped in ad hoc in the spirit of “well, everyone must agree to this. . . .” Bland assumptions of universal agree- ment are one of the most irritating bad habits of the economist- turned-ethicist. This book does not attempt to establish ethical principles. It does, however, refute ethical principles to the extent that they are insinuated, ad hoc and unanalyzed, into economic treatises. Binary Intervention: Taxation 169"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"An example is the common quest for “canons of justice” in taxa- tion. The prime objection to these “canons” is that the writers have first to establish the justice of taxation itself. If this cannot be proven, and so far it has not been, then it is clearly idle to look for the “just tax.” If taxation itself is unjust, then it is clear that no allocation of its burdens, however ingenious, can be declared just. This book sets forth no doctrines on the justice or injustice of taxation. But we do exhort economists either to forget about the problem of the “just tax” or, at least, to develop a compre- hensive ethical system before they tackle this problem again. Why do not economists abandon the search for the “just tax” as they abandoned the quest for the “just price”? One reason is that doing so may have unwelcome implications for them. The “just price” was abandoned in favor of the market price. Can the “just tax” be abandoned in favor of the market tax? Clearly not, for on the market there is no taxation, and therefore no tax can be established that will duplicate market patterns. As will be seen further below, there is no such thing as a “neutral tax”—a tax that will leave the market free and undisturbed—just as there is no such thing as neutral money. Economists and others may try to approximate neutrality, in the hopes of disturbing the market as little as possible, but they can never fully succeed. B. C OSTS OF C OLLECTION , C ONVENIENCE , AND C ERTAINTY Even the simplest maxims must not be taken for granted. Two centuries ago, Adam Smith laid down four canons of jus- tice in taxation that economists have parroted ever since. 60 One of them deals with the distribution of the burden of taxation, and this will be treated in detail below. Perhaps the most “obvi- ous” was Smith’s injunction that costs of collection be kept to a “minimum” and that taxes be levied with this principle in mind. 170 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 60 Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations (New York: Modern Library, 1937), pp. 777–79. See also Hunter and Allen, Principles of Public Finance, pp. 137–40."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"An obvious and harmless maxim? Certainly not; this “canon of justice” is not obvious at all. For the bureaucrat employed in tax collection will tend to favor a tax with high administrative costs, thereby necessitating more extensive bureaucratic employment. Why should we call the bureaucrat obviously wrong? The answer is that he is not, and that to call him “wrong” it is necessary to engage in an ethical analysis that no economist has bothered to undertake. A further point: if the tax is unjust on other grounds, it may be more just to have high administrative costs, for then there will be less chance that the tax will be fully collected. If it is easy to collect the tax, then the tax may do more damage to the eco- nomic system and cause more distortion of the market econ- omy. The same point might be made about another of Smith’s canons: that a tax should be levied so that payment is convenient. Here again, this maxim seems obvious, and there is certainly much truth in it. But someone may urge that a tax should be made inconvenient to induce people to rebel and force a lowering of the level of taxation. Indeed, this used to be one of the prime arguments of “conservatives” for an income tax as opposed to an indirect tax. The validity of this argument is beside the point; the point is that it is not self-evidently wrong, and therefore this canon is no more simple and obvious than the others. Smith’s final canon of just taxation is that the tax be certain and not arbitrary, so that the taxpayer knows what he will pay. Here again, further analysis demonstrates that this is by no means obvious. Some may argue that uncertainty benefits the taxpayer, for it makes the requirement more flexible and per- mits bribery of the tax collector. This benefits the taxpayer to the extent that the price of the bribe is less than the tax that he would otherwise have to pay. Furthermore, there is no way of establishing long-range certainty, for the tax rates may be changed by the government at any time. In the long run, cer- tainty of taxation is an impossible goal. Binary Intervention: Taxation 171"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"A similar argument may be levelled against the view that taxes “should” be difficult to evade. If a tax is onerous and unjust, evasion might be highly beneficial to the economy, and moral to boot. Thus, none of these supposedly self-evident canons of taxa- tion is a canon at all. From some ethical points of view they are correct, from others they are incorrect. Economics cannot decide between them. C. D ISTRIBUTION OF THE T AX B URDEN Up to this point, we have been discussing taxation as it is levied on any given individual or firm. Now we must turn to another aspect: the distribution of the burden of taxes among the people in the economy. Most of the search for “justice” in taxa- tion has involved the problem of the “just distribution” of this burden. Various proposed canons of justice will be discussed in this section, followed by analysis of the economic effects of tax dis- tribution. (1) Uniformity of Treatment (a) Equality before the law: tax exemption Uniformity of treatment has been upheld as an ideal by almost all writers. This ideal is supposed to be implicit in the concept of “equality before the law,” which is best expressed in the phrase, “Like to be treated alike.” To most economists this ideal has seemed self-evident, and the only problems considered have been the practical ones of defining exactly when one per- son is “like” someone else (problems that, we shall see below, are insuperable). All these economists adopt the goal of uniformity regardless of what principle of “likeness” they may hold. Thus, the man who believes that everyone should be taxed in accordance with his “ability to pay” also believes that everyone with the same ability should be taxed equally; he who believes that each should 172 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"be taxed proportionately to his income also holds that everyone with the same income should pay the same tax; etc. In this way, the ideal of uniformity pervades the literature on taxation. Yet this canon is by no means obvious, for it seems clear that the justice of equality of treatment depends first of all on the jus- tice of the treatment itself. Suppose, for example, that Jones, with his retinue, proposes to enslave a group of people. Are we to maintain that “justice” requires that each be enslaved equally ? And suppose that someone has the good fortune to escape. Are we to condemn him for evading the equality of justice meted out to his fellows? It is obvious that equality of treatment is no canon of justice whatever. If a measure is unjust, then it is just that it have as little general effect as possible. Equality of unjust treatment can never be upheld as an ideal of justice. Therefore, he who maintains that a tax be imposed equally on all must first establish the justice of the tax itself. Many writers denounce tax exemptions and levy their fire at the tax-exempt, particularly those instrumental in obtaining the exemptions for themselves. These writers include those advo- cates of the free market who treat a tax exemption as a special privilege and attack it as equivalent to a subsidy and therefore inconsistent with the free market. Yet an exemption from taxa- tion or any other burden is not equivalent to a subsidy. There is a key difference. In the latter case a man is receiving a special grant of privilege wrested from his fellowmen; in the former he is escaping a burden imposed on other men. Whereas the one is done at the expense of his fellowmen, the other is not. For in the former case, the grantee is participating in the acquisition of loot; in the latter, he escapes payment of tribute to the looters. To blame him for escaping is equivalent to blaming the slave for fleeing his master. It is clear that if a certain burden is unjust, blame should be levied, not on the man who escapes the burden, but on the man or men who impose it in the first place. If a tax is in fact unjust, and some are exempt from it, the hue and cry should not be to extend the tax to everyone, but on the contrary to Binary Intervention: Taxation 173"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"extend the exemption to everyone. The exemption itself cannot be considered unjust unless the tax or other burden is first estab- lished as just . Thus, uniformity of treatment per se cannot be established as a canon of justice. A tax must first be proven just; if it is unjust, then uniformity is simply imposition of general injustice, and exemption is to be welcomed. Since the very fact of taxation is an interference with the free market, it is particularly incongru- ous and incorrect for advocates of a free market to advocate uni- formity of taxation. One of the major sources of confusion for economists and others who are in favor of the free market is that the free soci- ety has often been defined as a condition of “equality before the law,” or as “special privilege for none.” As a result, many have transferred these concepts to an attack on tax exemptions as a “special privilege” and a violation of the principle of “equality before the law.” As for the latter concept, it is, again, hardly a criterion of justice, for this depends on the justice of the law or “treatment” itself. It is this alleged justice, rather than equality, which is the primary feature of the free market. In fact, the free society is far better described by some such phrase as “equality of rights to defend person and property” or “equality of liberty” rather than by the vague, misleading expression “equality before the law.” 61 In the literature on taxation there is much angry discussion about “loopholes,” the inference being that any income or area exempt from taxation must be brought quickly under its sway. Any failure to “plug loopholes” is treated as immoral. But, as Mises incisively asked: What is a loophole? If the law does not punish a def- inite action or does not tax a definite thing, this is not 174 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 61 This discussion applies to Professor Hayek’s adoption of the “rule of law” as the basic political criterion. F.A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"a loophole. It is simply the law. . . . The income tax exemptions in our income tax are not loopholes. . . . Thanks to these loopholes this country is still a free country. 62 (b) The impossibility of uniformity Aside from these considerations, the ideal of uniformity is impossible to achieve. Let us confine our further discussion of uniformity to income taxation , for two reasons: (1) because the vast bulk of our taxation is income taxation; and (2) because, as we have seen, most other taxes boil down to income taxes any- way. A tax on consumption ends largely as a tax on income at a lower rate. There are two basic reasons why uniformity of income taxa- tion is an impossible goal. The first stems from the very nature of the State. We have seen, when discussing Calhoun’s analysis, that the State must separate society into two classes, or castes: the taxpaying caste and the tax-consuming caste. The tax con- sumers consist of the full-time bureaucracy and politicians in power, as well as the groups which receive net subsidies, i.e., which receive more from the government than they pay to the government. These include the receivers of government con- tracts and of government expenditures on goods and services produced in the private sector. It is not always easy to detect the net subsidized in practice, but this caste can always be concep- tually identified. Thus, when the government levies a tax on private incomes, the money is shifted from private people to the government, and the government’s money, whether expended for govern- ment consumption of goods and services, for salaries to bureau- crats, or as subsidies to privileged groups, returns to be spent in the economic system. It is clear that the tax-expenditure level Binary Intervention: Taxation 175 62 Mises, in Aaron Director, ed., Defense, Controls and Inflation (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), pp. 115–16."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"must distort the expenditure pattern of the market and shift pro- ductive resources away from the pattern desired by the produc- ers and toward that desired by the privileged. This distortion takes place in proportion to the amount of taxation. If, for example, the government taxes funds that would have been spent on automobiles and itself spends them on arms, the arms industry and, in the long run, the specific factors in the arms industry become net tax consumers, while a special loss is inflicted on the automobile industry and ultimately on the fac- tors specific to that industry. It is because of these complex rela- tionships that, as we have mentioned, the identification in prac- tice of the net subsidized may be difficult. One thing we know without difficulty, however. Bureaucrats are net tax consumers. As we pointed out above, bureaucrats cannot pay taxes. Hence, it is inherently impossible for bureau- crats to pay income taxes uniformly with everyone else. And therefore the ideal of uniform income taxation for all is an impossible goal. We repeat that the bureaucrat who receives $8,000 a year income and then hands $1,500 back to the gov- ernment is engaging in a mere bookkeeping transaction of no economic importance (aside from the waste of paper and records involved). For he does not and cannot pay taxes; he sim- ply receives $6,500 a year from the tax fund. If it is impossible to tax income uniformly because of the nature of the tax process itself, the attempt to do so also con- fronts another insuperable difficulty, that of trying to arrive at a cogent definition of “income.” Should taxable income include the imputed money value of services received in kind, such as farm produce grown on one’s own farm? What about imputed rent from living in one’s own house? Or the imputed services of a housewife? Regardless of which course is taken in any of these cases, a good argument can be made that the incomes included as taxable are not the correct ones. And if it is decided to impute the value of goods received in kind, the estimates must always be arbitrary, since the actual sales for money were not made. 176 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"A similar difficulty is raised by the question whether incomes should be averaged over several years. Businesses that suffer losses and reap profits are penalized as against those with steady incomes—unless, of course, the government subsidizes part of the loss. This may be corrected by permitting averaging of income over several years, but here again the problem is insol- uble because there are only arbitrary ways of deciding the period of time to allow for averaging. If the income tax rate is “progressive,” i.e., if the rate increases as earnings increase, then failure to permit averaging penalizes the man with an erratic income. But again, to permit averaging will destroy the ideal of uniform current tax rates; furthermore, varying the period of averaging will vary the results. We have seen that, in order to tax income only, it is neces- sary to correct for changes in the purchasing power of money when taxing capital gains. But once again, any index or factor of correction is purely arbitrary, and uniformity cannot be achieved because of the impossibility of securing general agree- ment on a definition of income. For all these reasons, the goal of uniformity of taxation is an impossible one. It is not simply difficult to achieve in practice; it is conceptually impossible and self-contradictory. Surely any ethical goal that is conceptually impossible of achievement is an absurd goal, and therefore any movements in the direction of the goal are absurd as well. 63 It is therefore legitimate, and even necessary, to engage in a logical (i.e., praxeological) critique of ethical goals and systems when they are relevant to economics. Binary Intervention: Taxation 177 63 To say that an ethical goal is conceptually impossible is completely dif- ferent from saying that its achievement is “unrealistic” because few peo- ple uphold it. The latter is by no means an argument against an ethical principle. Conceptual impossibility means that the goal could not be achieved even if everyone aimed at it.

Should taxes be uniform as to “ability to pay,” or “sacrifice,” or “benefits received”? In other words, while most writers have rather unthinkingly granted that people in the same income bracket should pay the same tax, what principle should govern the distribution of income taxes between tax brackets? Should the man making $10,000 a year pay as much as, as much proportionately as, more than, more propor- tionately than, or less than, a man making $5,000 or $1,000 a year? In short, should people pay uniformly in accordance with their “ability to pay,” or sacrifice made, or some other principle? (2) The “Ability-To-Pay” Principle (a) The ambiguity of the concept This principle states that people should pay taxes in accor- dance with their “ability to pay.” It is generally conceded that the concept of ability to pay is a highly ambiguous one and pres- ents no sure guide for practical application. 64 Most economists have employed the principle to support a program of propor- tional or progressive income taxation, but this would hardly suf- fice. It seems clear, for example, that a person’s accumulated wealth affects his ability to pay. A man earning $5,000 during a certain year probably has more ability to pay than a neighbor earning the same amount if he also has $50,000 in the bank while his neighbor has nothing. Yet a tax on accumulated capi- tal would cause general impoverishment. No clear standard can be found to gauge “ability to pay.” Both wealth and income would have to be considered, medical expenses would have to be deducted, etc. But there is no precise criterion to be invoked, and the decision is necessarily arbitrary. Thus, should all or some proportion of medical bills be deducted? What about the 178 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 64 See Walter J. Blum and Harry Kalven, Jr., The Uneasy Case for Pro- gressive Taxation (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. 64–68."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"expenses of childrearing? Or food, clothing, and shelter as nec- essary to consumer “maintenance”? Professor Due attempts to find a criterion for ability in “economic well-being,” but it should be clear that this concept, being even more subjective, is still more difficult to define. 65 Adam Smith himself used the ability concept to support pro- portional income taxation (taxation at a constant percentage of income), but his argument is rather ambiguous and applies to the “benefit” principle as well as to “ability to pay.” 66 Indeed, it is hard to see in precisely what sense ability to pay rises in pro- portion to income. Is a man earning $10,000 a year “equally able” to pay $2,000 as a man earning $1,000 to pay $200? Set- ting aside the basic qualifications of difference in wealth, med- ical expenses, etc., in what sense can “equal ability” be demon- strated? Attempting to define equal ability in such a way is a meaningless procedure. McCulloch, in a famous passage, attacked progressiveness and defended proportionality of taxation: The moment you abandon . . . the cardinal principle of exacting from all individuals the same proportion of their income or their property, you are at sea with- out rudder or compass, and there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit. 67 Binary Intervention: Taxation 179 65 Due, Government Finance , pp. 121 ff. 66 Said Smith: The subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in pro- portion of their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under pro- tection of the state. The expense of government to the individuals of a great nation, is like the expense of man- agement to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged to contribute to their respective interests in the estate.

McCulloch, A Treatise on the Principle and Practical Influence of Taxation and the Funding System (London, 1845), p. 142."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Seemingly plausible, this thesis is by no means self-evident. In what way is proportional taxation any less arbitrary than any given pattern of progressive taxation, i.e., where the rate of tax increases with income? There must be some principle that can justify proportionality; if this principle does not exist, then pro- portionality is no less arbitrary than any other taxing pattern. Various principles have been offered and will be considered below, but the point is that proportionality per se is neither more nor less sound than any other taxation. One school of thought attempts to find a justification for a progressive tax via an ability-to-pay principle. This is the “fac- ulty” approach of E.R.A. Seligman. This doctrine holds that the more money a person has, the relatively easier it is for him to acquire more. His power of obtaining money is supposed to increase as he has more: “A rich man may be said to be subject . . . to a law of increasing returns.” 68 Therefore, since his ability increases at a faster rate than his income, a progressive income tax is justified. This theory is simply invalid. 69 Money does not “make money”; if it did, then a few people would by now own all the world’s wealth. To be earned money must continually be justifying itself in current service to consumers. Personal income, interest, profits, and rents are earned only in accor- dance with their current , not their past, services. The size of accumulated fortune is immaterial, and fortunes can be and are dissipated when their owners fail to reinvest them wisely in the service of consumers. As Blum and Kalven point out, the Seligman thesis is utter nonsense when applied to personal services such as labor energy. It could only make sense when applied to income from property, i.e., investment in land or capital goods (or slaves, in 180 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 68 E.R.A. Seligman, Progressive Taxation in Theory and Practice (2nd ed.; (New York: Macmillan & Co., 1908), pp. 291–92. 69 For an excellent critique of the Seligman theory, see Blum and Kal- ven, Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation, pp. 64–66."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"a slave economy). But the return on capital is always tending toward uniformity, and any departures from uniformity are due to especially wise and farseeing investments (profits) or espe- cially wasteful investments (losses). The Seligman thesis would fallaciously imply that the rates of return increase in proportion to the amount invested. Another theory holds that ability to pay is proportionate to the “producer’s surplus” of an individual, i.e., his “economic rent,” or the amount of his income above the payment necessary for him to continue production. The consequences of taxation of site rent were noted above. The “necessary payments” to labor are clearly impossible to establish; if someone is asked by the tax authorities what his “minimum” wage is, what will prevent him from saying that any amount below the present wage will cause him to retire or to shift to another job? Who can prove differ- ently? Furthermore, even if it could be determined, this “sur- plus” is hardly an indicator of ability to pay. A movie star may have practically zero surplus, for some other studio may be will- ing to bid almost as much as he makes now for his services, while a disabled ditch-digger may have a much greater “surplus” because no one else may be willing to hire him. Generally, in an advanced economy there is little “surplus” of this type, for the competition of the market will push alternative jobs and uses near to the factor’s discounted marginal value product in its pres- ent use. Hence, it would be impossible to tax any “surplus” over necessary payment from land or capital since none exists, and practically impossible to tax the “surplus” to labor since the exis- tence of a sizable surplus is rare, impossible to determine, and, in any case, no criterion whatever of ability to pay. 70 (b) The justice of the standard The extremely popular ability-to-pay idea was sanctified by Adam Smith in his most important canon of taxation and has Binary Intervention: Taxation 181 70 See ibid ., pp. 67–68."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"been accepted blindly ever since. While much criticism has been levelled at its inherent vagueness, hardly anyone has criti- cized the basic principle, despite the fact that no one has really grounded it in sound argument. Smith himself gave no reason- ing to support this alleged principle, and few others have done so since. Due, in his text on public finance, simply accepts it because most people believe in it, thereby ignoring the possibil- ity of any logical analysis of ethical principles. 71 The only substantial attempt to give some rational support to the “ability-to-pay principle” rests on a strained comparison of tax payments to voluntary gifts to charitable organizations. Thus Groves writes: “To hundreds of common enterprises (commu- nity chests, Red Cross, etc.) people are expected to contribute according to their means. Governments are one of these com- mon enterprises fostered to serve the citizens as a group. . . .” 72 Seldom have more fallacies been packed into two sen tences. In the first place, the government is not a common enterprise akin to the community chest. No one can resign from it. No one, on penalty of imprisonment, can come to the conclusion that this “charitable enterprise” is not doing its job properly and there- fore stop his “contribution”; no one can simply lose interest and drop out. If, as will be seen further below, the State cannot be described as a business, engaged in selling services on the mar- ket, certainly it is ludicrous to equate it to a charitable organi- zation. Government is the very negation of charity, for charity is uniquely an unbought gift, a freely flowing uncoerced act by the giver. The word “expected” in Groves’ phrase is misleading. No one is forced to give to any charity in which he is not inter- ested or which he believes is not doing its job properly. The contrast is even clearer in a phrase of Hunter and Allen’s: 182 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 71 Due, Government Finance , p. 122. 72 Groves, Financing Government , p. 36."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Contributions to support the church or the commu- nity chest are expected, not on the basis of benefits which individual members receive from the organiza- tion, but upon the basis of their ability to con- tribute. 73 But this is praxeologically invalid. The reason that anyone con- tributes voluntarily to a charity is precisely the benefit that he obtains from it. Yet benefit can be considered only in a subjec- tive sense. It can never be measured. The fact of subjective gain, or benefit, from an act is deducible from the fact that it was performed. Each person making an exchange is deduced to have benefited (at least ex ante ). Similarly , a person who makes a unilateral gift is deduced to have benefited ( ex ante ) from making the gift. If he did not benefit, he would not have made the gift. This is another indication that praxeology does not assume the existence of an “economic man,” for the benefit from an action may come either from a good or a service directly received in exchange, or simply from the knowledge that someone else will benefit from a gift. Gifts to charitable institutions, therefore, are made precisely on the basis of ben- efit to the giver, not on the basis of his “ability to pay.” Furthermore, if we compare taxation with the market, we find no basis for adopting the “ability-to-pay” principle. On the contrary, the market price (generally considered the just price) is almost always uniform or tending toward uniformity. Market prices tend to obey the rule of one price throughout the entire market. Everyone pays an equal price for a good regardless of how much money he has or his “ability to pay.” Indeed, if the “ability-to-pay” principle pervaded the market, there would be no point in acquiring wealth, for everyone would have to pay more for a product in proportion to the money in his posses- sion. Money incomes would be approximately equalized, and, in fact, there would be no point at all to acquiring money, since the Binary Intervention: Taxation 183 73 Hunter and Allen, Principles of Public Finance , pp. 190–91."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"purchasing power of a unit of money would never be definite but would drop, for any man, in proportion to the quantity of money he earns. A person with less money would simply find the purchasing power of a unit of his money rising accordingly. Therefore, unless trickery and black marketeering could evade the regulations, establishing the “ability-to-pay” principle for prices would wreck the market altogether. The wrecking of the market and the monetary economy would plunge society back to primitive living standards and, of course, eliminate a large part of the current world population, which is permitted to earn a subsistence living or higher by virtue of the existence of the modern, developed market. It should be clear, moreover, that establishing equal incomes and wealth for all (e.g., by taxing all those over a certain stan- dard of income and wealth, and subsidizing all those below that standard) would have the same effect, since there would be no point to anyone’s working for money. Those who enjoy per- forming labor will do so only “at play,” i.e., without obtaining a monetary return. Enforced equality of income and wealth, therefore, would return the economy to barbarism. If taxes were to be patterned after market pricing, then, taxes would be levied equally ( not proportionately) on everyone. As will be seen below, equal taxation differs in critical respects from market pricing but is a far closer approximation to it than is “ability-to-pay” taxation. Finally, the “ability-to-pay” principle means precisely that the able are penalized, i.e., those most able in serving the wants of their fellow men. Penalizing ability in production and service diminishes the supply of the service—and in proportion to the extent of that ability. The result will be impoverishment, not only of the able, but of the rest of society, which benefits from their services. The “ability-to-pay” principle, in short, cannot be simply assumed; if it is employed, it must be justified by logical argu- ment, and this economists have yet to provide. Rather than being an evident rule of justice, the “ability-to-pay” principle 184 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"resembles more the highwayman’s principle of taking where the taking is good. 74 (3) Sacrifice Theory Another attempted criterion of just taxation was the subject of a flourishing literature for many decades, although it is now decidedly going out of fashion. The many variants of the “sac- rifice” approach are akin to a subjective version of the “ability- to-pay” principle. They all rest on three general premises: ( a ) that the utility of a unit of money to an individual diminishes as his stock of money increases; ( b ) that these utilities can be com- pared interpersonally and thus can be summed up, subtracted, etc.; and ( c ) that everyone has the same utility-of-money sched- ule. The first premise is valid (but only in an ordinal sense), but the second and third are nonsensical. The marginal utility of money does diminish, but it is impossible to compare one per- son’s utilities with another, let alone believe that everyone’s val- uations are identical. Utilities are not quantities, but subjective orders of preference. Any principle for distributing the tax bur- den that rests on such assumptions must therefore be declared fallacious. Happily, this truth is now generally established in the economic literature. 75 Utility and “sacrifice” theory has generally been used to jus- tify progressive taxation, although sometimes proportional tax- ation has been upheld on this ground. Briefly, a dollar is alleged to “mean less” or be worth less in utility to a “rich man” than to a “poor man” (“rich” or “poor” in income or wealth?), and Binary Intervention: Taxation 185 74 See Chodorov, Out of Step , p. 237. See also Chodorov, From Solomon’s Yoke to the Income Tax (Hinsdale, Ill.: Henry Regnery, 1947), p. 11. 75 The acceptance of this critique dates from Robbins’ writings of the mid-1930’s. See Lionel Robbins, “Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility,” Economic Journal , December, 1938, pp. 635–41; and Robbins, An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science (2nd ed.; London: Macmil- lan & Co., 1935), pp. 138–41. Robbins was, at that time, a decidedly “Misesian” economist."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"76 For a critique of sacrifice theory, see Blum and Kalven, Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation , pp. 39–63. therefore payment of a dollar by a rich man imposes less of a subjective sacrifice on him than on a poor man. Hence, the rich man should be taxed at a higher rate. Many “ability-to-pay” the- ories are really inverted sacrifice theories, since they are couched in the form of ability to make sacrifices. Since the nub of the sacrifice theory—interpersonal compar- isons of utility—is now generally discarded, we shall not spend much time discussing the sacrifice doctrine in detail. 76 How- ever, several aspects of this theory are of interest. The sacrifice theory divides into two main branches: (1) the equal-sacrifice principle and (2) the minimum-sacrifice principle . The former states that every man should sacrifice equally in paying taxes; the latter, that society as a whole should sacrifice the least amount. Both versions abandon completely the idea of govern- ment as a supplier of benefits and treat government and taxation as simply a burden, a sacrifice that must be borne in the best way we know how. Here we have a curious principle of justice indeed—based on adjustment to hurt. We are faced again with that pons asinorum that defeats all attempts to establish canons of justice for taxation—the problem of the justice of taxation itself . The proponent of the sacrifice theory, in realistically abandon- ing unproved assumptions of benefit from taxation, must face and then founder on the question: If taxation is pure hurt, why endure it at all ? The equal-sacrifice theory asks that equal hurt be imposed on all. As a criterion of justice, this is as untenable as asking for equal slavery. One interesting aspect of the equal-sacrifice the- ory, however, is that it does not necessarily imply progressive income taxation! For although it implies that the rich man should be taxed more than the poor man, it does not necessarily say that the former should be taxed more than proportionately. In fact, it does not even establish that all be taxed proportionately ! In 186 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"short, the equal-sacrifice principle may demand that a man earning $10,000 be taxed more than a man earning $1,000, but not necessarily that he be taxed a greater percentage or even proportionately. Depending on the shapes of the various “util- ity curves,” the equal-sacrifice principle may well call for regres- sive taxation under which a wealthier man would pay more in amount but less proportionately (e.g., the man earning $10,000 would pay $500, and the man earning $1,000 would pay $200). The more rapidly the utility of money declines, the more prob- ably will the equal-sacrifice curve yield progressivity. A slowly declining utility-of-money schedule would call for regressive taxation. Argument about how rapidly various utility-of-money schedules decline is hopeless because, as we have seen, the entire theory is untenable. But the point is that even on its own grounds, the equal-sacrifice theory can justify neither progres- sive nor proportionate taxation. 77 The minimum-sacrifice theory has often been confused with the equal-sacrifice theory. Both rest on the same set of false assumptions, but the minimum-sacrifice theory counsels very drastic progressive taxation. Suppose, for example, that there are two men in a community, Jones making $50,000, and Smith making $30,000. The principle of minimum social sacrifice, resting on the three assumptions described above, declares: $1.00 taken from Jones imposes less of a sacrifice than $1.00 taken from Smith; hence, if the government needs $1.00, it takes it from Jones. But suppose the government needs $2.00; the second dollar will impose less of a sacrifice on Jones than the first dollar taken from Smith, for Jones still has more money left than Smith and therefore sacrifices less. This continues as long as Jones has more money remaining than Smith. Should the government need $20,000 in taxes, the minimum-sacrifice prin- ciple counsels taking the entire $20,000 from Jones and zero Binary Intervention: Taxation 187 77 For an attempt to establish proportional taxation on the basis of equal sacrifice, see Bradford B.

In other words, it advocates taking all of the high- est incomes in turn until governmental needs are fulfilled. 78 The minimum-sacrifice principle depends heavily, as does the equal-sacrifice theory, on the untenable view that everyone’s utility-of-money schedule is roughly identical. Both rest also on a further fallacy, which now must be refuted: that “sacrifice” is simply the obverse of the utility of money . For the subjective sac- rifice in taxation may not be merely the opportunity cost for- gone of the money paid; it may also be increased by moral out- rage at the tax procedure. Thus, Jones may become so morally outraged at the above proceedings that his marginal subjective sacrifice quickly becomes very great, much “greater” than Smith’s if we grant for a moment that the two can be compared. Once we see that subjective sacrifice is not necessarily tied to the utility of money, we may extend the principle further. Con- sider, for example, a philosophical anarchist who opposes all taxation fervently. Suppose that his subjective sacrifice in the payment of any tax is so great as to be almost infinite. In that case, the minimum-sacrifice principle would have to exempt the anarchist from taxation, while the equal-sacrifice principle could tax him only an infinitesimal amount. Practically, then, the sacrifice principle would have to exempt the anarchist from taxation. Furthermore, how can the government determine the subjective sacrifice of the individual? By asking him? In that case, how many people would refrain from proclaiming the enormity of their sacrifice and thus escape payment completely? Similarly, if two individuals subjectively enjoyed their identi- cal money incomes differently, the minimum-sacrifice principle would require that the happier man be taxed less because he 188 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 78 Pushed to its logical conclusion in which the State is urged to estab- lish “maximum social satisfaction”—the obverse of minimum social sac- rifice—the principle counsels absolute compulsory egalitarianism, with everyone above a certain standard taxed in order to subsidize everyone else to come up to that standard.

Who will suggest heavier taxation on the unhappy or the ascetic? And who would then refrain from loudly proclaiming the enormous enjoyment he derives from his income? It is curious that the minimum-sacrifice principle counsels the obverse of the ability-to-pay theory, which, particularly in its “state of well-being” variant, advocates a special tax on hap- piness and a lower tax on un happiness. If the latter principle pre- vailed, people would rush to proclaim their unhappiness and deep-seated asceticism. It is clear that the proponents of the ability-to-pay and sac- rifice theories have completely failed to establish them as crite- ria of just taxation. These theories also commit a further grave error. For the sacrifice theory explicitly, and the ability-to-pay theory implicitly, set up presumed criteria for action in terms of sacrifice and burden. 79 The State is assumed to be a burden on society, and the question becomes one of justly distributing this burden. But man is constantly striving to sacrifice as little as he can for the benefits he receives from his actions. Yet here is a theory that talks only in terms of sacrifice and burden, and calls for a certain distribution without demonstrating to the taxpayers that they are benefiting more than they are giving up. Since the the- orists do not so demonstrate, they can make their appeal only in terms of sacrifice—a procedure that is praxeologically invalid. Since men always try to find net benefits in a course of action, it follows that a discussion in terms of sacrifice or burden can- not establish a rational criterion for human action. To be prax- eologically valid, a criterion must demonstrate net benefit. It is true, of course, that the proponents of the sacrifice theory are far more realistic than the proponents of the benefit theory (which we shall discuss below), in considering the State a net Binary Intervention: Taxation 189 79 The ability-to-pay principle is unclear on this point. Some propo- nents base their argument implicitly on sacrifice; others, on the necessity for payment for “untraceable” benefits."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"burden on society rather than a net benefit; but this hardly demonstrates the justice of the sacrifice principle of taxation. Quite the contrary. (4) The Benefit Principle The benefit principle differs radically from the two preceding criteria of taxation. For the sacrifice and ability-to-pay principles depart completely from the principles of action and the accepted criteria of justice on the market. On the market people act freely in those ways which they believe will confer net benefits upon them. The result of these actions is the monetary exchange sys- tem, with its inexorable tendency toward uniform pricing and the allocation of productive factors to satisfy the most urgent demands of all the consumers. Yet the criteria used in judging taxation differ completely from those which apply to all other actions on the market. Suddenly free choice and uniform pricing are forgotten, and the discussion is all in terms of sacrifice, bur- den, etc. If taxation is only a burden, it is no wonder that coer- cion must be exercised to maintain it. The benefit principle, on the other hand, is an attempt to establish taxation on a similar basis as market pricing; that is, the tax is to be levied in accordance with the benefit received by the individual. It is an attempt to achieve the goal of a neutral tax , one that would leave the economic sys- tem approximately as it is on the free market. It is an attempt to achieve praxeological soundness by establishing a criterion of payment on the basis of benefit rather than sacrifice. The great gulf between the benefit and other principles was originally unrecognized, because of Adam Smith’s confusion between ability to pay and benefit. In the quotation cited above, Smith inferred that everyone benefits from the State in propor- tion to his income and that this income establishes his ability to pay. Therefore, a tax on his ability to pay will simply be a quid pro quo in exchange for benefits conferred by the State. Some writers have contended that people benefit from government in proportion to their income; others, that they benefit in increased proportion to their income, thus justifying a progressive income 190 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"tax. Yet this entire application of the benefit theory is nonsensi- cal. How do the rich reap a greater benefit proportionately, or even more than proportionately, from government than the poor? They could do so only if the government were responsible for these riches by a grant of special privilege, such as a subsidy, a monopoly grant, etc. Otherwise, how do the rich benefit? From “welfare” and other redistributive expenditures, which take from the rich and give to the bureaucrats and the poor? Certainly not. From police protection? But it is precisely the rich who could more afford to pay for their own protection and who therefore derive less benefit from it than the poor. The ben- efit theory holds that the rich benefit more from protection because their property is more valuable; but the cost of protec- tion may have little relation to the value of the property. Since it costs less to police a bank vault containing $100 million than to guard 100 acres of land worth $10 per acre, the poor landowner receives a far greater benefit from the State’s protec- tion than the rich owner of personalty. Neither would it be rel- evant to say that A earns more money than B because A receives a greater benefit from “society” and should therefore pay more in taxes. In the first place, everyone participates in society. The fact that A earns more than B means precisely that A’s services are individually worth more to his fellows. Therefore, since A and B benefit similarly from society’s existence, the reverse argument is far more accurate: that the differential between them is due to A’s individual superiority in productivity, and not at all to “society.” Secondly, society is not at all the State, and the State’s possible claim must be independently validated. Hence, neither proportionate nor progressive income taxa- tion can be sustained on benefit principles. In fact, the reverse is true. If everyone were to pay in accordance with benefit received, it is clear that ( a ) the recipients of “welfare” benefits would bear the full costs of these benefits: the poor would have to pay for their own doles (including, of course, the extra cost of paying the bureaucracy for making the transfers); ( b ) the buy- ers of any government service would be the only payers, so that Binary Intervention: Taxation 191"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"government services could not be financed out of a general tax fund; and ( c ) for police protection, a rich man would pay less than a poor man, and less in absolute amounts. Furthermore, landowners would pay more than owners of intangible property, and the weak and infirm, who clearly benefit more from police protection than the strong, would have to pay higher taxes than the latter. It becomes immediately clear why the benefit principle has been practically abandoned in recent years. For it is evident that if ( a ) welfare recipients and ( b ) receivers of other special privi- lege, such as monopoly grants, were to pay according to the benefit received, there would not be much point in either form of government expenditure. And if each were to pay an amount equal to the benefit he received rather than simply proportion- ately (and he would have to do so because there would be nowhere else for the State to turn for funds), then the recipient of the subsidy would not only earn nothing, but would have to pay the bureaucracy for the cost of handling and transfer. The establishment of the benefit principle would therefore result in a laissez-faire system, with government strictly limited to sup- plying defense service. And the taxation for this defense service would be levied more on the poor and the infirm than on the strong and the rich. At first sight, the believer in the free market, the seeker after a neutral tax, is inclined to rejoice. It would seem that the ben- efit principle is the answer to his search. And this principle is indeed closer to market principles than the previous alleged canons. Yet, if we pursue the analysis more closely, it will be evi- dent that the benefit principle is still far from market neutrality. On the market, people do not pay in accordance with individual benefit received; they pay a uniform price, one that just induces the marginal buyer to participate in the exchange. The more eager do not pay a higher price than the less eager; the chess addict and the indifferent player pay the same price for the same chess set, and the opera enthusiast and the novice pay the same price for the same ticket. The poor and the weak would be most 192 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"eager for protection, but, in contrast to the benefit principle, they would not pay more on the market . There are even graver defects in the benefit principle. For market exchanges ( a ) demonstrate benefit and ( b ) only establish the fact of benefit without measuring it. The only reason we know that A and B benefit from an exchange is that they volun- tarily make the exchange. In this way, the market demonstrates benefit. But where taxes are levied, the payment is compulsory, and therefore benefit can never be demonstrated . As a matter of fact, the existence of coercion gives rise to the opposite pre- sumption and implies that the tax is not a benefit, but a burden. If it really were a benefit, coercion would not be necessary. Secondly, the benefit from exchange can never be measured or compared interpersonally. The “consumers’ surplus” derived from exchange is purely subjective, nonmeasurable, and non- comparable scientifically. Therefore, we never know what these benefits are, and hence there can be no way of allocating the taxes in accordance with them. Thirdly, on the market everyone enjoys a net benefit from an exchange. A person’s benefit is not equal to his cost, but greater. Therefore, taxing away his alleged benefit would completely violate market principles. Finally, if each person were taxed according to the benefit he receives from government, it is obvious that, since the bureau- cracy receive all their income from this source, they would, like other recipients of subsidy and privilege, be obliged to return their whole salary to the government. The bureaucracy would have to serve without pay. We have seen that the benefit principle would dispense with all subsidy expenditures of whatever type. Government services would have to be sold directly to buyers; but in that case, there would be no room for government ownership, for the charac- teristic of a government enterprise is that it is launched from tax funds. Police and judicial services are often declared by the pro- ponents of the benefit principle to be inherently general and Binary Intervention: Taxation 193"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"unspecialized, so that they would need to be purchased out of the common tax fund rather than by individual users. How- ever, as we have seen, this assumption is incorrect; these serv- ices can be sold on the market like any others. Thus, even in the absence of all other deficiencies of the benefit principle, it would still establish no warrant for taxation at all, for all serv- ices could be sold on the market directly to beneficiaries. It is evident that while the benefit principle attempts to meet the market criterion of limiting payment solely to beneficiaries, it must be adjudged a failure; it cannot serve as a criterion for a neutral tax or any other type of taxation. (5) The Equal Tax and the Cost Principle Equality of taxation has far more to commend it than any of the above principles, none of which can be used as a canon of taxation. “Equality of taxation” means just that—a uniform tax on every member of the society. This is also called a head tax, capitation tax, or poll tax. (The latter term, however, is best used to describe a uniform tax on voting, which is what the poll tax has become in various American states.) Each person would pay the same tax annually to the government. The equal tax would be particularly appropriate in a democracy, with its emphasis on equality before the law, equal rights, and absence of discrimination and special privilege. It would embody the principle: “One vote, one tax.” It would appropriately apply only to the protection services of the government, for the gov- ernment is committed to defending everyone equally. There- fore, it may seem just for each person to be taxed equally in return. The principle of equality would rule out, as would the benefit principle, all government actions except defense, for all other expenditures would set up a special privilege or subsidy of some kind. Finally, the equal tax would be far more nearly neu- tral than any of the other taxes considered, for it would attempt to establish an equal “price” for equal services rendered. One school of thought challenges this contention and asserts that a proportional tax would be more nearly neutral than an 194 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"equal tax. The proponents of this theory point out that an equal tax alters the market’s pattern of distribution of income. Thus, if A earns 1,000 gold ounces per year, B earns 200 ounces, and C earns 50 ounces, and each pays 10 ounces in taxes, then the relative proportion of net income remaining after taxes is altered, and altered in the direction of greater inequality. A proportion- ate tax of a fixed percentage on all three would leave the distri- bution of income constant and would therefore be neutral rela- tive to the market. This thesis misconceives the whole problem of neutrality in taxation. The object of the quest is not to leave the income dis- tribution the same as if a tax had not been imposed. The object is to affect the income “distribution” and all other aspects of the econ- omy in the same way as if the tax were really a free-market price. And this is a very different criterion. No market price leaves relative income “distribution” the same as before. If the market really behaved in this way, there would be no advantage in earning money, for people would have to pay proportionately higher prices for goods in accordance with the level of their earnings. The market tends toward uniformity of pricing and hence toward equal pricing for equal service. Equal taxation, there- fore, would be far more nearly neutral and would constitute a closer approach to a market system. The equal-tax criterion, however, has many grave defects, even as an approach toward a neutral tax. In the first place, the market criterion of equal price for equal service faces the prob- lem: What is an “equal service”? The service of police protec- tion is of far greater magnitude in an urban crime area than it is in some sleepy backwater. That service is worth far more in the crime center, and therefore the price paid will tend to be greater in a crime-ridden area than in a peaceful area. It is very likely that, in the purely free market, police and judicial services would be sold like insurance, with each member paying regular premiums in return for a call on the benefits of protection when needed. It is obvious that a more risky individual (such as one living in a crime area) would tend to pay a higher premium than Binary Intervention: Taxation 195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"individuals in another area. To be neutral, then, a tax would have to vary in accordance with costs and not be uniform. 80 Equal taxation would distort the allocation of social resources in defense. The tax would be below the market price in the crime areas and above the market price in the peaceful areas, and there would therefore be a shortage of police protection in the dan- gerous areas and a surplus of protection in the others. Another grave flaw of the equal-tax principle is the same that we noted in the more general principle of uniformity: no bureaucrat can pay taxes. An “equal tax” on a bureaucrat or politician is an impossibility, because he is one of the tax con- sumers rather than taxpayers. Even when all other subsidies are eliminated, the government employee remains a permanent obstacle in the path of equal tax. As we have seen, the bureau- crat’s “tax payment” is simply a meaningless bookkeeping device. These flaws in the equal tax cause us to turn to the last remaining tax canon: the cost principle . The cost principle would apply as we have just discussed it, with the government setting the tax in accordance with costs, like the premiums charged by an insurance company. 81 The cost principle would constitute 196 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 80 This does not concede that “costs” determine “prices.” The general array of final prices determines the general array of cost prices, but then the viability of firms is determined by whether the price people will pay for their products is enough to cover their costs, which are determined throughout the market. In equilibrium, costs and prices will all be equal. Since a tax is levied on general funds and therefore cannot be equivalent to market pricing, the only way to approximate market pricing is to set the tax according to costs, since costs at least reflect market pricing of the nonspecific factors. 81 Blum and Kalven mention the cost principle but casually dismiss it as being practically identical with the benefit principle: Sometimes the theory is stated in terms of the cost of the government services performed for each citizen rather than in terms of the benefits received from such services."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"the closest approach possible to neutrality of taxation. Yet even the cost principle has fatal flaws that finally eliminate it from consideration. In the first place, although the costs of nonspe- cific factors could be estimated from market knowledge, the costs of specific factors could not be determined by the State. The impossibility of calculating specific costs stems from the fact that products of tax-supported firms have no real market price, and so specific costs are unknown. As a result, the cost principle cannot be accurately put into effect. The cost principle is further vitiated by the fact that a compulsory monopoly—such as State protection—will invariably have higher costs and sell lower- quality service than freely competitive defense firms on the mar- ket. As a result, costs will be much higher than on the market, and, again, the cost principle offers no guide to a neutral tax. A final flaw is common to both the equality and the cost the- ories of taxation. In neither case is benefit demonstrated as accru- ing to the taxpayer. Although the taxpayer is blithely assumed to be benefiting from the service just as he does on the market, we have seen that such an assumption cannot be made—that the use of coercion presumes quite the contrary for many taxpayers. The market requires a uniform price, or the exact covering of costs, only because the purchaser voluntarily buys the product in the expectation of being benefited. The State, on the other hand, would force people to pay the tax even if they were not voluntarily willing to pay the cost of this or any other defense Binary Intervention: Taxation 197 This refinement may avoid the need of measuring sub- jective benefits, but it does little else for the theory. ( Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation, p. 36 n) Yet their major criticism of the benefit principle is precisely that it requires the impossible measurement of subjective benefit. The cost prin- ciple, along with the benefit principle, dispenses with all government expenditures except laissez-faire ones, since each recipient would be required to pay the full cost of the service. With respect to the laissez-faire service of protection, however, the cost principle is clearly far superior to the benefit principle."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"system. Hence, the cost principle can never provide a route to the neutral tax. (6) Taxation “For Revenue Only” A slogan popular among many “right-wing” economists is that taxation should be for “revenue only,” and not for broad social purposes. On its face, this slogan is simply and palpably absurd, since all taxes are levied for revenue. What else can tax- ation be called but the appropriation of funds from private indi- viduals by the State for its own purposes? Some writers there- fore amend the slogan to say: Taxation should be limited to rev- enue essential for social services. But what are social services? To some people, every conceivable type of government expen- diture appears as a “social service.” If the State takes from A and gives to B, C may applaud the act as a “social service” because he dislikes something about the former and likes something about the latter. If, on the other hand, “social service” is limited by the “unanimity rule” to apply only to those activities that serve some individuals without making others pay, then the “taxation-for-revenue-only” formula is simply an ambiguous term for the benefit or the cost principles. (7) The Neutral Tax: A Summary We have thus analyzed all the alleged canons of tax justice. Our conclusions are twofold: (1) that economics cannot assume any principle of just taxation, and that no one has successfully established any such principles; and (2) that the neutral tax , which seems to many a valid ideal, turns out to be conceptually impossible to achieve. Economists must therefore abandon their futile quest for the just, or the neutral, tax. Some may ask: Why does anyone search for a neutral tax? Why consider neutrality an ideal? The answer is that all services, all activities, can be provided in two ways only: by freedom or by coercion. The former is the way of the market; the latter, of the State. If all services were organized on the market, the result would be a purely free-market system; if all were organized by 198 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"the State, the result would be socialism (see below). Therefore, all who are not full socialists must concede some area to market activity, and, once they do so, they must justify their departures from freedom on the basis of some principle or other. In a soci- ety where most activities are organized on the market, advocates of State activity must justify departures from what they them- selves concede to the market sphere. Hence, the use of neutral- ity is a benchmark to answer the question: Why do you want the State to step in and alter market conditions in this case? If mar- ket prices are uniform, why should tax payments be otherwise? But if neutral taxation is, at bottom, impossible, there are two logical courses left for advocates of the neutral tax: either abandon the goal of neutrality, or abandon taxation itself. D. V OLUNTARY C ONTRIBUTIONS TO G OVERNMENT A few writers, disturbed by the compulsion necessary to the existence of taxation, have advocated that governments be financed, not by taxation, but by some form of voluntary con- tribution. Such voluntary contribution systems could take vari- ous forms. One was the method relied on by the old city-state of Hamburg and other communities—voluntary gifts to the government. President William F. Warren of Boston Univer- sity, in his essay, “Tax Exemption the Road to Tax Abolition,” described his experience in one of these communities: For five years it was the good fortune of the present writer to be domiciled in one of these communities. Incredible as it may seem to believers in the necessity of a legal enforcement of taxes by pains and penalties, he was for that period . . . his own assessor and his own tax-gatherer. In common with the other citizens, he was invited, without sworn statement or declara- tion, to make such contribution to the public charges as seemed to himself just and equal. That sum, uncounted by any official, unknown to any but him- self, he was asked to drop with his own hand into a strong public chest; on doing which his name was Binary Intervention: Taxation 199"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"checked off the list of contributors. . . . Every citizen felt a noble pride in such immunity from prying assessors and rude constables. Every annual call of the authorities on that community was honored to the full. 82 The gift method, however, presents some serious difficulties. In particular, it continues that disjunction between payment and receipt of service which constitutes one of the great defects of a taxing system. Under taxation, payment is severed from receipt of service, in striking contrast to the market where payment and service are correlative. The voluntary gift method perpetuates this disjunction. As a result, A, B, and C continue to receive the government’s defense service even if they paid nothing for it, and only D and E contributed. D’s and E’s contributions, fur- thermore, may be disproportionate. It is true that this is the sys- tem of voluntary charity on the market. But charity flows from 200 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 82 Dr. Warren’s article appeared in the Boston University Year Book for 1876. The board of the Council of the University endorsed the essay in these words: In place of the further extent of taxation advocated by many, the essay proposes a far more imposing reform, the general abolition of all compulsory taxes. It is hoped that the comparative novelty of the proposition may not deter practical men from a thoughtful study of the paper. ( See the Boston University Year Book III (1876), pp. 17–38) Both quotations may be found in Sidney H. Morse, “Chips from My Studio,” The Radical Review, May, 1877, pp. 190–92. See also Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, pp. 801–03; Francis A. Walker, Political Economy (New York: Henry Holt, 1911), pp. 475–76. Smith, in one of his most sensible canons, declared: In a small republic, where the people have entire confi- dence in their magistrates and are convinced of the neces- sity of the tax for the support of the state, and believe that it will be faithfully applied to that purpose, such conscien- tious and voluntary payment may sometimes be expected. (Smith , Wealth of Nations , p. 802)"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the more to the less wealthy and able; it does not constitute an efficient method for organizing the general sale of a service. Automobiles, clothes, etc., are sold on the market on a regular uniform-price basis and are not indiscriminately given to some on the basis of gifts received from others. Under the gift system people will tend to demand far more defense service from the government than they are willing to pay for; and the voluntary contributors, getting no direct reward for their money, will tend to reduce their payment. In short, where service (such as defense) flows to people regardless of payment, there will tend to be excessive demands for service, and an insufficient supply of funds to sustain it. When the advocates of taxation, therefore, contend that a voluntary society could never efficiently finance defense service because people would evade payment, they are correct insofar as their strictures apply to the gift method of finance. The gift method, however, hardly exhausts the financing methods of the purely free market. A step in the direction of greater efficiency would have the defense agency charging a set price instead of accepting hap- hazard amounts varying from the very small to the very large, but continuing to supply defense indiscriminately. Of course, the agency would not refuse gifts for general purposes or for granting a supply of defense service to poor people. But it would charge some minimum price commensurate with the cost of its service. One such method is a voting tax, now known as a poll tax. 83 A poll tax, or voting tax, is not really a “tax” at all; it is only a price charged for participating in the State organization. 84 Only those who voluntarily vote for State officials, i.e., who par- ticipate in the State machinery, are required to pay the tax. If all Binary Intervention: Taxation 201 83 The current poll tax began simply as a head tax, but in practice it is enforced only as a requirement for voting . It has therefore become a vot- ing tax. 84 See below on fees charged for government service."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"the State’s revenues were derived from poll taxes, therefore, this would not be a system of taxation at all, but rather voluntary contributions in payment for the right to participate in the State’s machinery. The voting tax would be an improvement over the gift method because it would charge a certain uniform or minimal amount. To the proposal to finance all government revenues from poll taxes it has been objected that practically no one would vote under these conditions. This is perhaps an accurate prediction, but curiously the critics of the poll tax never pursue their analy- sis beyond this point. It is clear that this reveals something very important about the nature of the voting process. Voting is a highly marginal activity because ( a ) the voter obtains no direct benefits from his act of voting, and ( b ) his aliquot power over the final decision is so small that his abstention from voting would make no appreciable difference to the final outcome. In short, in contrast to all other choices a man may make, in polit- ical voting he has practically no power over the outcome, and the outcome would make little direct difference to him anyway. It is no wonder that well over half the eligible American voters persistently refuse to take part in the annual November ballot- ing. This discussion also illuminates a puzzling phenomenon in American political life—the constant exhortation by politicians of all parties for people to vote: “We don’t care how you vote, but vote !” is a standard political slogan. 85 On its face, it makes little sense, for one would think that at least one of the parties would see advantages in a small vote. But it does make a great deal of sense when we realize the enormous desire of politicians 202 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 85 Voting, like taxation, is another activity generally phrased in terms of “duty” rather than benefit. The call to “duty” is as praxeologically unsound as the call to sacrifice and generally amounts to the same thing. For both exhortations tacitly admit that the actor will derive little or no benefit from his action. Further, the invocation of duty or sacrifice implies that someone else is going to receive the sacrifice or the payment of the “obligation”—and often that someone is the exhorter himself."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"of all parties to make it appear that the people have given them a “mandate” in the election—that all the democratic shibbo- leths about “representing the people,” etc., are true. The reason for the relative triviality of voting is, once again, the disjunction between voting and payment, on the one hand, and benefit on the other. The poll tax gives rise to the same problem. The voter, with or without paying a poll tax, receives no more benefit in protection than the nonvoter. Consequently, people will refuse to vote in droves under a single poll-tax scheme, and everyone will demand the use of the artificially free defense resources. Both the gift and the voting-tax methods of voluntary financ- ing of government, therefore, must be discarded as inefficient. A third method has been proposed, which we can best call by the paradoxical name voluntary taxation . The plan envisioned is as follows: Every land area would, as now, be governed by one monopolistic State. The State’s officials would be chosen by democratic voting, as at present. The State would set a uniform price, or perhaps a set of cost prices, for protective services, and it would be left to each individual to make a voluntary choice whether to pay or not to pay the price. If he pays the price, he receives the benefit of governmental defense service; if he does not, he goes unprotected. 86 The leading “voluntary taxationists” have been Auberon Herbert, his associate, J. Greevz Fisher, and (sometimes) Gustave de Molinari. The same position is found Binary Intervention: Taxation 203 86 We are assuming that the government will confine its use of force to defense, i.e., will pursue a strictly laissez-faire policy. Theoretically, it is pos- sible that a government may get all its revenue from voluntary contri bution, and yet pursue a highly coercive, interventionist policy in other areas of the market. The possibility is so remote in practice, however, that we may disregard it here. It is highly unlikely that a government coercive in other ways would not take immediate steps to see that its revenues are assured by coercion. Its own revenue is always the State’s prime concern.

And yet this proposal has sev- eral important defects. Its most serious flaw is inconsistency. For the voluntary taxationists aim at establishing a system in which no one is coerced who is not himself an invader of the person or property of others. Hence their complete elimination of taxation. But, although they eliminate the compulsion to sub- scribe to the government defense monopoly, they yet retain that monopoly. They are therefore faced with the problem: Would they use force to compel people not to use a freely competing defense agency within the same geographic area? The voluntary taxationists have never attempted to answer this problem; they have rather stubbornly assumed that no one would set up a competing defense agency within a State’s territorial limits. And yet, if people are free to pay or not to pay “taxes,” it is obvious that some people will not simply refuse to pay for all protection. Dissatisfied with the quality of defense they receive from the government, or with the price they must pay, they will elect to form a competing defense agency or “government” within the area and subscribe to it. The voluntary taxation system is thus impossible of attainment because it would be in unstable equilib- rium. If the government elected to outlaw all competing defense agencies, it would no longer function as the voluntary 204 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 87 Spencer, Social Statics ; Herbert and Levy, Taxation and Anarchism ; and Molinari, Society of Tomorrow . At other times, however, Molinari adopted the pure free-market position. Thus, see what may be the first developed outline of the purely libertarian system in Gustave de Moli- nari, “De la production de la sécurité,” Journal des Economistes, February, 1849, pp. 277–90, and Molinari, “Onzième soirée” in Les soirées de la rue Saint Lazare (Paris, 1849)."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"society sought by its proponents. It would not force payment of taxes, but it would say to the citizens: “You are free to accept and pay for our protection or to abstain; but you are not free to purchase defense from a competing agency.” This is not a free market; this is a compulsory monopoly , once again a grant of monopoly privilege by the State to itself. Such a monopoly would be far less efficient than a freely competitive system; hence, its costs would be higher, its service poorer. It would clearly not be neutral to the market. On the other hand, if the government did permit free com- petition in defense service, there would soon no longer be a central government over the territory. Defense agencies, police and judicial, would compete with one another in the same unco- erced manner as the producers of any other service on the mar- ket. The prices would be lower, the service more efficient. And, for the first and only time, the defense system would then be neutral in relation to the market. It would be neutral because it would be a part of the market itself! Defense service would at last be made fully marketable. No longer would anyone be able to point to one particular building or set of buildings, one uniform or set of uniforms, as representing “our government.” While “the government” would cease to exist, the same can- not be said for a constitution or a rule of law, which, in fact, would take on in the free society a far more important function than at present. For the freely competing judicial agencies would have to be guided by a body of absolute law to enable them to distinguish objectively between defense and invasion. This law, embodying elaborations upon the basic injunction to defend person and property from acts of invasion, would be codified in the basic legal code. Failure to establish such a code of law would tend to break down the free market, for then defense against invasion could not be adequately achieved. On the other hand, those neo-Tolstoyan nonresisters who refuse to employ violence even for defense would not themselves be forced into any relationship with the defense agencies.

The previous government would now simply be one competing defense agency among many on the market. It would, in fact, be competing at a severe disadvantage, having been established on the principle of “dem- ocratic voting.” Looked at as a market phenomenon, “demo- cratic voting” (one vote per person) is simply the method of the consumer “co-operative.” Empirically, it has been demon- strated time and again that co-operatives cannot compete suc- cessfully against stock-owned companies, especially when both are equal before the law. There is no reason to believe that co- operatives for defense would be any more efficient. Hence, we may expect the old co-operative government to “wither away” through loss of customers on the market, while joint-stock (i.e., corporate) defense agencies would become the prevailing mar- ket form. 88 206 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 88 These corporations would not, of course, need any charter from a government but would “charter” themselves in accordance with the ways in which their owners decided to pool their capital. They could announce their limited liability in advance, and then all their creditors would be put amply on guard. There is a strong a priori reason for believing that corporations will be superior to cooperatives in any given situation. For if each owner receives only one vote regardless of how much money he has invested in a project (and earnings are divided in the same way), there is no incentive to invest more than the next man; in fact, every incentive is the other way.

In discussing taxation, they engage in serious analysis, faulty as some of it may be; but they have devoted little attention to a theoretical treatment of expenditure. Harriss, in fact, goes so far as to say that a theory of government expenditure is impossible or, at least, nonexistent. 2 The bulk of discussion of expenditures is devoted to describing their great proliferation, absolute and relative, in the last decades, coupled with the assumption (implicit or explicit) that this growth has been necessary to “cope with the growing complexities of the economy.” This slogan or similar ones have gained almost universal acceptance but have never been ration- ally supported.

Resource-using activi- ties employ nonspecific resources that could have been used for other production; they withdraw factors of production from private uses to State-designated uses. Transfer activities may be defined as those which use no resources, i.e., which transfer money directly from Peter to Paul. These are the pure subsidy- granting activities. Now, of course, there is considerable similarity between the two branches of government action. Both are transfer activities insofar as they pay the salaries of the bureaucracy engaged in these operations. Both even involve shifts of resources, since transfer activities shift nonspecific factors from free-market, voluntary activity to demands stemming from State-privileged groups. Both subsidize: the supply of governmental services, as well as the purchase of material by government enterprises, constitutes a subsidy. But the difference is important enough to preserve. For in one case, goods are used for and resources are devoted to State purposes as the State wills; in the other, the State subsidizes private individuals, who employ resources as they think best. Transfer payments are pure subsidies without prior diversion of resources. We shall first analyze transfer payments as pure subsidies and then see how the analysis applies to the subsidizing aspects of resource-using activities. 1. Government Subsidies: Transfer Payments There are two and only two ways of acquiring wealth: the economic means (voluntary production and exchange) and the political means (confiscation by coercion). On the free market only the economic means can be used, and consequently every- one earns only what other individuals in society are willing to pay for his services.

Now the political means to wealth becomes available. On the free market, wealth is only a resultant of the voluntary choices of all individuals and the extent to which men serve each other. But the possibility of gov- ernment subsidy permits a change: it opens the way to an allo- cation of wealth in accordance with the ability of a person or group to gain control of the State apparatus. Government subsidy creates a separate distribution process (not “redistribution,” as some would be tempted to say). For the first time, earnings are severed from production and exchange and become separately determined. To the extent that this dis- tribution occurs, therefore, the allocation of earnings is dis- torted away from efficient service to consumers. Therefore, we may say that all cases of subsidy coercively penalize the efficient for the benefit of the inefficient . Subsidies consequently prolong the life of inefficient firms at the expense of efficient ones, distort the productive system, and hamper the mobility of factors from less to more value-produc- tive locations. They injure the market greatly and prevent the full satisfaction of consumer wants. Suppose, for example, an entrepreneur is sustaining losses in some industry, or the owner of a factor is earning a very low sum there. On the market, the factor owner would shift to a more value-productive industry, where both the owner of the factor and the consumers would be better served. If the government subsidizes him where he is, however, the life of inefficient firms is prolonged, and factors are encouraged not to enter their most value-productive uses. The greater the extent of government subsidy in the economy, therefore, the more the market is prevented from working, and the more inefficient will the market be in catering to consumer wants. Hence, the greater the government subsidy, the lower will be the standard of living of everyone, of all the consumers. On the free market, as we have seen, there is a harmony of interests, for everyone demonstrably gains in utility from mar- ket exchange. Where government intervenes, on the other Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 209"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"hand, caste conflict is thereby created, for one man benefits at the expense of another. This is most clearly seen in the case of gov- ernment transfer subsidies paid from tax or inflation funds—an obvious taking from Peter to give to Paul. Let the subsidy method become general, then, and everyone will rush to gain control of the government. Production will be more and more neglected, as people divert their energies to the political strug- gles, to the scramble for loot. It is obvious that production and general living standards are lowered in two ways: (1) by the diversion of energy from production to politics, and (2) by the fact that the government inevitably burdens the producers with the incubus of an inefficient, privileged group. The inefficient achieve a legal claim to ride herd on the efficient. This is all the more true since those who succeed in any occupation will inevitably tend to be those who are best at it . Those who succeed on the free market, in economic life, will therefore be those most adept at production and at serving their fellowmen; those who succeed in the political struggle will be those most adept at employing coercion and winning favors from wielders of coercion. Gener- ally, different people will be adept at these different tasks, in accordance with universal specialization and the division of labor, and hence the shackling of one set of people will be done for the benefit of another set. But perhaps it will be argued that the same people will be efficient at both activities and that, therefore, there will be no exploitation of one group at the expense of another. As we have said, this is hardly likely; if true, the subsidy system would die out, because it would be pointless for a group to pay the gov- ernment to subsidize itself. But, further, the subsidy system would promote the predatory skills of these individuals and penalize their productive ones. In sum, governmental subsidy systems promote inefficiency in production and efficiency in coercion and subservience, while penalizing efficiency in pro- duction and inefficiency in predation. Those people who ethi- cally favor voluntary production can gauge which system—the free market or subsidies—scores the higher economic marks, 210 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"while those who favor conquest and confiscation must at least reckon with the overall loss of production that their policy brings about. This analysis applies to all forms of government subsidies, including grants of monopolistic privilege to favored produc- ers. A common example of direct transfer subsidies is govern- mental poor relief . State poor relief is clearly a subsidization of poverty. Men are now automatically entitled to money from the State because of their poverty. Hence, the marginal disu- tility of income forgone from leisure diminishes, and idleness and poverty tend to increase. Thus, State subsidization of poverty tends to increase poverty, which in turn increases the amount of subsidy paid and extracted from those who are not impoverished. When, as is generally the case, the amount of subsidy depends directly on the number of children possessed by the pauper, there is a further incentive for the pauper to have more children than otherwise, since he is assured of a proportionate subsidy by the State. Consequently, the number of paupers tends to multiply still further. As Thomas Mackay aptly stated: . . . the cause of pauperism is relief. We shall not get rid of pauperism by extending the sphere of State relief. . . . On the contrary, its adoption would increase our pauperism, for, as is often said, we can have exactly as many paupers as the country chooses to pay for. 3 Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 211 3 Thomas Mackay, Methods of Social Reform (London: John Murray, 1896), p. 210.

Instead, charity is a voluntary and flexible act of grace on the part of the giver. The sincerity of government’s desire to promote charity may be gauged by two perennial governmental drives: one, to sup- press “charity rackets,” and the other, to drive individual beg- gars off the streets because “the government makes plenty of provision for them.” 4 The effect of both measures is to suppress voluntary individual gifts of charity and to force the public to route its giving into those channels approved by and tied in with government officialdom. Similarly, unemployment relief , instead of helping to cure unemployment, as often imagined, actually subsidizes and intensifies it. We have seen that unemployment arises when laborers or unions set a minimum wage above what they can obtain on the free market. Tax aid helps them to keep this unre- alistic minimum and hence prolongs the period in which they can continue to withhold their labor from the market. 212 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 4 From the following admiring anecdote of such a drive, the reader can gauge just who was the true friend of the poor organ-grinder—his cus- tomer or the government: . . . during a similar campaign to clean up the streets of organ-grinders (most of whom were simply licensed beg- gars) a woman came up to LaGuardia at a social function and begged him not to deprive her of her favorite organ grinder. “Where do you live?” he asked her. “On Park Avenue!” LaGuardia successfully pushed through his plan to elimi- nate the organ-grinders and the peddlers, despite the pleas of the penthouse slummers.

Resource-Using Activities: Government Ownership versus Private Ownership The bulk of government activities use resources, redirecting factors of production to government-chosen ends. These activ- ities generally involve the real or supposed supply of services by government to some or all of the populace. Government func- tions here as an owner and enterpriser. Resource-using expenditures by government are often con- sidered “investment,” and this classification forms an essential part of the Keynesian doctrine. We have argued that, on the contrary, all of this expenditure must be considered consumption . Investment occurs where producers’ goods are bought by entre- preneurs, not at all for their own use or satisfaction, but merely to reshape and resell them to others—ultimately to the con- sumers. But government redirects the resources of society to its ends, chosen by it and backed by the use of force. Hence, these purchases must be considered consumption expenditures, what- ever their intention or physical result. They are a particularly wasteful form of “consumption,” however, since they are gener- ally not regarded as consumption expenditures by government officials. Government enterprises may either provide “free” services or charge a price or fee to users. “Free” services are particularly characteristic of government. Police and military protection, fire fighting, education, some water supply come to mind as examples. The first point to note, of course, is that these serv- ices are not and cannot be truly free . A free good would not be a good and thus not an object of human action; it would exist in abundance for all. If a good does not exist plentifully for all, then the resource is scarce, and supplying it costs society other goods forgone. Hence, it cannot be free. The resources needed to supply the free governmental service are extracted from the rest of production. Payment is made, however, not by users on the basis of their voluntary purchases, but by a coerced levy on Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 213"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"the taxpayers. A basic split is effected between payment for and receipt of service. Many grave consequences follow from this split and from the “free” service. As in all cases where price is below the free-mar- ket price, an enormous and excessive demand is stimulated for the good, far beyond the supply of such service available. Con- sequently, there will always be “shortages” of the free good, constant complaints of insufficiency, overcrowding, etc. To illustrate, we need only cite such common conditions as police shortages, particularly in crime-ridden districts, teacher and school shortages in the public school system, traffic jams on government-owned streets and highways, etc. In no area of the free market are there chronic complaints about shortages and insufficiencies. In all areas of private enterprise, firms try to coax and persuade consumers to buy more of their product. Where government owns, on the other hand, there are invari- ably calls on consumers for patience and sacrifice, and there are continual problems of shortages and deficiencies. It is doubtful if any private enterprise would ever do what the government of New York and other cities have done: exhort the consumers to use less water. It is also characteristic of government operation that when a water shortage develops, it is the consumers and not the government “enterprisers” who are blamed for the short- age. The pressure is on consumers to sacrifice and use less, while in private industry the (welcome) pressure is on entrepre- neurs to supply more. 5 The well-known inefficiencies of government operation are not empirical accidents, resulting perhaps from the lack of a civil-service tradition. They are inherent in all government enterprise, and the excessive demand fomented by free and other underpriced services is just one of the many reasons for this condition. 214 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 5 See Murray N. Rothbard, “Government in Business,” in Essays on Liberty (Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Educa- tion, 1958), IV, 186 ff."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Thus, free supply not only subsidizes the users at the expense of nonusing taxpayers; it also misallocates resources by failing to supply the service where it is most needed. The same is true, to a lesser extent, wherever the price is under the free-market price. On the free market, consumers can dictate the pricing and thereby assure the best allocation of productive resources to supply their wants. In a government enterprise, this cannot be done. Let us take again the case of the free service. Since there is no pricing, and therefore no exclusion of submarginal uses, there is no way that government, even if it wanted to, could allocate its services to the most important uses and to the most eager buyers. All buyers, all uses, are artificially kept on the same plane. As a result, the most important uses will be slighted, and the government is faced with insuperable allocation prob- lems, which it cannot solve even to its own satisfaction . Thus, the government will be confronted with the problem: Should we build a road in place A or place B? There is no rational way by which it can make this decision. It cannot aid the private con- sumers of the road in the best way. It can decide only according to the whim of the ruling government official, i.e., only if the government official , not the public, does the “consuming.” If the government wishes to do what is best for the public, it is faced with an impossible task. Government can either deliberately subsidize by giving a service away free, or it may genuinely try to find the true mar- ket price, i.e., to “operate on a business basis.” This is often the cry raised by conservatives—that government enterprise be placed on a “business footing,” that deficits be ended, etc. Almost always this means raising the price. Is this a solution, however? It is often stated that a single government enterprise, operating within the sphere of a private market, buying from it, etc., can price its services and allocate its resources efficiently. This, however, is incorrect. There is a fatal flaw that permeates every conceivable scheme of government enterprise and ineluctably prevents it from rational pricing and efficient allo- cation of resources. Because of this flaw, government enterprise Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 215"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"can never be operated on a “business” basis, no matter what the government’s intentions. What is this fatal flaw? It is the fact that government can obtain virtually unlimited resources by means of its coercive tax power. Private businesses must obtain their funds from investors. It is this allocation of funds by investors on the basis of time preference and foresight that rations funds and resources to the most profitable and therefore the most service- able uses. Private firms can get funds only from consumers and investors; they can get funds, in other words, only from people who value and buy their services and from investors who are willing to risk investment of their saved funds in anticipation of profit. In short, payment and service are, once again, indissol- ubly linked on the market. Government, on the other hand, can get as much money as it likes. The free market provides a “mechanism” for allocating funds for future and present con- sumption, for directing resources to their most value-produc- tive uses for all the people. It thereby provides a means for busi- nessmen to allocate resources and to price services to insure such optimum use. Government, however, has no checkrein on itself, i.e., no requirement for meeting a profit-and-loss test of valued service to consumers, to enable it to obtain funds. Pri- vate enterprise can get funds only from satisfied, valuing cus- tomers and from investors guided by profits and losses. Gov- ernment can get funds literally at its own whim. With the checkrein gone, gone also is any opportunity for government to allocate resources rationally. How can it know whether to build road A or road B, whether to “invest” in a road or a school—in fact, how much to spend for all its activities? There is no rational way that it can allocate funds or even decide how much to have. When there is a shortage of teachers or schoolrooms or police or streets, the government and its sup- porters have only one answer: more money. The people must relinquish more of their money to the government. Why is this answer never offered on the free market? The reason is that money must be withdrawn from some other use in consumption 216 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"or investment—and this withdrawal must be justified. This jus- tification is provided by the test of profit and loss: the indication that the most urgent wants of the consumers are being satisfied. If an enterprise or product is earning high profits for its own- ers, and these profits are expected to continue, more money will be forthcoming; if not, and losses are being incurred, money will flow out of the industry. The profit-and-loss test serves as the critical guide for directing the flow of productive resources. No such guide exists for the government, which has no rational way to decide how much money to spend, either in total, or in each specific line. The more money it spends, the more service it can supply—but where to stop? 6 Proponents of government enterprise may retort that the government could simply tell its bureau to act as if it were a profit-making enterprise and to establish itself in the same way as a private business. There are two flaws in this theory. First, it is impossible to play enterprise. Enterprise means risking one’s own money in investment. Bureaucratic managers and politi- cians have no real incentive to develop entrepreneurial skill, to really adjust to consumer demands. They do not risk loss of their money in the enterprise. Secondly, aside from the question of incentives, even the most eager managers could not function as a business. Regardless of the treatment accorded the opera- tion after it is established, the initial launching of the firm is made with government money, and therefore by coercive levy. An arbitrary element has been “built into” the very vitals of the enterprise. Further, any future expenditures may be made out of tax funds, and therefore the decisions of the managers will be subject to the same flaw. The ease of obtaining money will inherently distort the operations of the government enterprise. Moreover, suppose the government “invests” in an enterprise, E. Either the free market, left alone, would also have invested the same amount in the selfsame enterprise, or it would not. If Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 217 6 Cf. Ludwig von Mises, Bureaucracy (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Uni- versity Press, 1946), pp. 50, 53."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"it would have, then the economy suffers at least from the “take” going to the intermediary bureaucracy. If not, and this is almost certain, then it follows immediately that the expenditure on E is a distortion of private utility on the market—that some other expenditure would have greater monetary returns. It follows once again that a government enterprise cannot duplicate the conditions of private business. In addition, the establishment of government enterprise creates an inherent competitive advantage over private firms, for at least part of its capital was gained by coercion rather than service. It is clear that government, with its subsidization, if it wishes can drive private business out of the field. Private investment in the same industry will be greatly restricted, since future investors will anticipate losses at the hands of the privi- leged governmental competitors. Moreover, since all services compete for the consumer’s dollar, all private firms and all pri- vate investment will to some degree be affected and hampered. And when a government enterprise opens, it generates fears in other industries that they will be next, and that they will be either confiscated or forced to compete with government-sub- sidized enterprises. This fear tends to repress productive investment further and thus lower the general standard of liv- ing still more. The clinching argument, and one that is used quite correctly by opponents of government ownership, is: If business opera- tion is so desirable, why take such a tortuous route? Why not scrap government ownership and turn the operation over to private enterprise? Why go to such lengths to try to imitate the apparent ideal (private ownership) when the ideal may be pur- sued directly? The plea for business principles in government, therefore, makes little sense, even if it could be successful. The inefficiencies of government operation are compounded by several other factors. As we have seen, a government enter- prise competing in an industry can usually drive out private owners, since the government can subsidize itself in many ways and supply itself with unlimited funds when desired. Thus, it 218 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"has little incentive to be efficient. In cases where it cannot com- pete even under these conditions, it can arrogate to itself a com- pulsory monopoly, driving out competitors by force. This was done in the United States in the case of the post office. 7 When the government thus grants itself a monopoly, it may go to the other extreme from free service: it may charge a monopoly price. Charging a monopoly price—identifiably different from a free-market price—distorts resources again and creates an artificial scarcity of the particular good. It also permits an enor- mously lowered quality of service. A governmental monopoly need not worry that customers may go elsewhere or that ineffi- ciency may mean its demise. 8 A further reason for governmental inefficiency has been touched on already: that the personnel have no incentive to be efficient. In fact, the skills they will develop will not be the eco- nomic skills of production, but political skills—how to fawn on political superiors, how demagogically to attract the electorate, how to wield force most effectively. These skills are very differ- ent from the productive ones, and therefore different people Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 219 7 See the interesting pamphlet by Frank Chodorov, The Myth of the Post Office, reprinted in Chodorov , One Is A Crowd (New York: Devin Adair, 1952), pp. 132–52.

Appleton, 1891), pp. 305–25. 8 Only governments can make self-satisfied announcements of cuts in service to effect economies. In private business, economies must be made as a corollary of improvements in service. A recent example of gov- ernmental cuts is the decline in American postal deliveries—joined, of course, with request for higher rates. When France nationalized the important Western Railway system in 1908, freight was increasingly damaged, trains slowed down, and accidents grew to such an extent that an economist caustically observed that the French government had added railway accidents to its growing list of monopolies.

Peri- odically, there are demands that the post office be put on a “business basis” and end its deficit, which must be paid by the taxpayers. But ending the deficit of an inherently and necessar- ily inefficient government operation does not mean going on a business basis. In order to do so, the price must be raised high enough to achieve a monopoly price and thus cover the costs of the government’s inefficiencies. A monopoly price will levy an excessive burden on the users of the postal service, especially since the monopoly is compulsory. On the other hand, we have seen that even monopolists must abide by the consumers’ demand schedule. If this demand schedule is elastic enough, it may well happen that a monopoly price will reduce revenue so much or cut down so much on its increase that a higher price will increase deficits rather than decrease them. An outstanding example has been the New York subway system in recent years, which has been raising its fares in a vain attempt to end its 220 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 9 Hayek showed us that the “worst get on top” in a collectivist regime. This is true for any government-run enterprise, however. For our pur- poses, we may excise the moral evaluation and say that, for any task, those who get on top will be those with the most skill in that particular task— a praxeological law. The difference is that the market promotes and rewards the skills of production and voluntary co-operation; government enterprise promotes the skills of mass coercion and bureaucratic submis- sion. See F.A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1944), pp. 134–52. 10 On the market, workers get paid in accordance with their (dis- counted) marginal value product.

One criterion supports pric- ing according to “marginal cost.” However, this is hardly a cri- terion at all and rests on classical economic fallacies of price determination by costs. For one thing, “marginal” varies according to the period of time surveyed. Furthermore, costs are not static, but flexible; they change according to selling prices and hence cannot be used as a guide to those prices. Moreover, prices equal average costs—or rather, average costs equal prices—only in final equilibrium, and equilibrium cannot be regarded as an ideal for the real world. The market only tends toward this goal. Finally, costs of government operation will be higher than for a similar operation on the free market. Government enterprise will not only hamper and repress private investment and entrepreneurship in the same industry and in industries throughout the economy; it will also disrupt the entire labor market. For ( a ) the government will decrease production and living standards in the society by siphoning off potentially productive labor to the bureaucracy; ( b ) in using confiscated funds, the government will be able to pay more than the market rate for labor, and hence set up a clamor by govern- ment job seekers for an expansion of the unproductive bureau- cratic machine; and ( c ) through high, tax-supported wages the government may well mislead workers and unions into believ- ing that this reflects the market wage in private industry, thereby causing unwanted unemployment. Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 221 11 Ironically enough, the higher fares have driven many customers to buying and driving their own cars, thus aggravating the perennial traffic problem (scarcity of government street space). Another example of gov- ernment intervention creating and multiplying its own difficulties! On the subways, see Ludwig von Mises, “Agony of the Welfare State,” The Freeman, May 4, 1953, pp. 556–57."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Moreover, government enterprise, basing itself on coercion over the consumer, can hardly fail to substitute its own values for those of its customers. Hence, artificially standardized serv- ices of poorer quality—fashioned to governmental taste and convenience—will hold sway, in contrast to those of the free market, where diversified services of high quality are supplied to fit the varied tastes of a multitude of individuals. 12 One cartel or one firm could not own all the means of pro- duction in the economy, because it could not calculate prices and allocate factors in a rational manner. This is the reason why State socialism could not plan or allocate rationally either. In fact, even two or more stages could not be completely integrated vertically on the market, for total integration would eliminate a whole segment of the market and establish an island of calcula- tional and allocational chaos, an island that would preclude optimal planning for profits and maximum satisfaction for the consumers. In the case of simple government ownership, still another extension of this thesis unfolds. For each governmental firm introduces its own island of chaos into the economy; there is no need to wait for socialism for chaos to begin its work. No government enterprise can ever determine prices or costs or allocate factors or funds in a rational, welfare-maximizing manner. No govern- ment enterprise can be established on a “business basis” even if the desire were present. Thus, any government operation injects a point of chaos into the economy; and since all markets are interconnected in the economy, every governmental activity disrupts and distorts pricing, the allocation of factors, con- sumption/ investment ratios, etc. Every government enterprise not only lowers the social utilities of the consumers by forcing 222 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 12 Governments, despite bickering before a decision, generally end up speaking with a single voice.

The greater the extent of government ownership, of course, the more pronounced will this impact become. Aside from its purely economic consequences, government ownership has another kind of impact on society: it necessarily substitutes conflict for the harmony of the free market. Since government service means service by one set of decision-mak- ers, it comes to mean uniform service. The desires of all those forced, directly or indirectly, to pay for the government service cannot be satisfied. Only some forms of the service can or will be produced by the government agency. As a result, government enterprise creates enormous caste conflicts among the citizens, each of whom has a different idea on the best form of service. In recent years, government schools in America have fur- nished a striking example of such conflicts. Some parents prefer racially segregated schools; others prefer integrated education. Some parents want their children taught socialism; others want antisocialist teaching in the schools. There is no way that gov- ernment can resolve these conflicts. It can only impose the will of the majority (or a bureaucratic “interpretation” of it) by coer- cion and leave an often large minority dissatisfied and unhappy. Whichever type of school is chosen, some groups of parents will suffer. On the other hand, there is no such conflict on the free market, which provides any type of service demanded. On the market, those who want segregated or integrated, socialist or individualist schools can have their wants satisfied. It is obvious, therefore, that governmental, as opposed to private, provision of services, lowers the standard of living of much of the popula- tion. The degrees of government ownership in the economy vary from one country to another, but in all countries the State has made sure that it owns the vital nerve centers, the command Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 223"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"posts of the society. It has acquired compulsory monopoly own- ership over these command posts, and it has always tried to convince the populace that private ownership and enterprise in these fields is simply and a priori impossible. We have seen, on the contrary, that every service can be supplied on the free mar- ket. The vital command posts invariably owned monopolistically by the State are: (1) police and military protection; (2) judicial protection; (3) monopoly of the mint (and monopoly of defin- ing money); (4) rivers and coastal seas; (5) urban streets and highways, and land generally (unused land, in addition to the power of eminent domain); and (6) the post office. The defense function is the one reserved most jealously by the State. It is vital to the State’s existence, for on its monopoly of force depends its ability to exact taxes from the citizens. If citizens were permitted privately owned courts and armies, then they would possess the means to defend themselves against invasive acts by the government as well as by private individuals. Con- trol of the basic land resources—particularly transportation—is, of course, an excellent method of ensuring overall control. The post office has always been a very convenient tool for the inspection and prohibition of messages by heretics or enemies of the State. In recent years, the State has constantly sought to expand these outposts. Monopoly of the mint and of the defini- tion of money (legal tender laws) has been used to achieve full control of the nation’s monetary system. This was one of the State’s most difficult tasks, since for centuries paper money was thoroughly distrusted by the people. Monopoly over the mint and the definition of monetary standards has led to the debase- ment of the coinage, a shift of monetary names from units of weight to meaningless terms, and the replacement of gold and silver by bank or government paper. At present, the State in nearly every country has achieved its major monetary goal: the ability to expand its revenue by inflating the currency at will. In the other areas—land and natural resources, transportation and communication—the State is more and more in control. Finally, 224 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"another critical command post held, though not wholly monop- olized by the State, is education. For government schooling permits influencing the youthful mind to accept the virtues of the government and of government intervention. 13 In many countries, the government does not have a compulsory monop- oly of schooling, but it approaches this ideal by compelling attendance of all children at either a government school or a private school approved or accredited by government. Compul- sory attendance herds into the schools those who do not desire schooling and thus drives too many children into education. Too few youngsters remain in such competing fields as leisure, home study, and business employment. 14 One very curious governmental activity has grown enor- mously in the present century. Its great popularity is a notable indication of widespread popular ignorance of praxeological law. We are referring to what is called “social security” legislation. This system confiscates the income of the poorer wage earners and then presumes to invest the money more wisely than they could themselves, later paying out the money to them or their beneficiaries in their old age. Considered as “social insurance,” this is a typical example of government enterprise: there is no relation between premiums and benefits, both changing yearly under the impact of political pressures. On the free market, any- one who wishes to invest in an insurance annuity or in stocks or real estate may do so. Compelling everyone to transfer his funds to the government forces him to lose utility.

The very fact that a government school exists and is therefore presumed to be good, teaches its little charges the virtues of government ownership, regardless of what is formally taught in textbooks. And if government ownership is prefer- able in schooling, why not in other educational media, such as newspa- pers, or in other important areas of society? 14 For a trenchant critique of compulsory attendance laws, see Good- man, Compulsory Mis-Education and the Community of Scholars ."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Thus, even on its face, it is difficult to understand the great popularity of the social security system. But the true nature of the operation differs greatly from its official image. For the gov- ernment does not invest the funds it takes in taxes; it simply spends them, giving itself bonds, which must be later cashed when the benefits fall due. How will the cash then be obtained? Only from further taxes or inflation. Thus, the public must pay twice for “social security.” The social security program taxes twice for one payment; it is a device to permit palatable taxation of the lower-income groups by the government. And, as is true of all taxes, the proceeds go into governmental consumption. In weighing the question of private or governmental owner- ship of any enterprise, then, one should keep in mind the fol- lowing conclusions of our analysis: (1) every service can be sup- plied privately on the market; (2) private ownership will be more efficient in providing better quality of service at lower cost; (3) allocation of resources in a private enterprise will bet- ter satisfy consumer demands, while government enterprise will distort allocations and introduce islands of calculational chaos; (4) government ownership will repress private activity in non- competing as well as competing firms; (5) private ownership insures the harmonious and co-operative satisfaction of desires, while government ownership creates caste conflict. 15 3. Resource-Using Activities: Socialism Socialism—or collectivism—occurs when the State owns all the means of production. It is the compulsory abolition and 226 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 15 Various other criteria advanced to decide between private and State action are fallacious. Thus, a common rule states that government should weigh “marginal social costs” against “marginal social benefits” in mak- ing a decision.

Socialism, therefore, extends the principle of compulsory governmental monopoly from a few isolated enterprises to the whole economic system. It is the violent abolition of the market. If an economy is to exist at all, there must be production in order to satisfy the desires of the consuming individuals. How is this production to be organized? Who is to decide on the allocation of factors to all the various uses, or on the income each factor will receive in each use? There are two and only two ways that an economy can be organized. One is by freedom and voluntary choice—the way of the market. The other is by force and dictation—the way of the State. To those ignorant of eco- nomics, it may seem that only the latter constitutes real organ- ization and planning, whereas the way of the market is only confusion and chaos. The organization of the free market, how- ever, is actually an amazing and flexible means of satisfying the wants of all individuals, and one far more efficient than State operation or intervention. Up to this point, however, we have discussed only isolated government enterprises and various forms of government inter- vention in the market. We must now examine socialism—the system of pure government dictation—the polar opposite of the purely free market. We have defined ownership as the exclusive control of a resource. It is clear, therefore, that a “planned economy” which leaves nominal ownership in the hands of the previous private owners, but which places the actual control and direction of resources in the hands of the State, is as much socialism as is the formal nationalization of property. The Nazi and Fascist regimes were as socialist as the Communist system that nation- alizes all productive property.

But economics is not concerned with the color of the uniform or with the good or bad manners of the rulers. Nor does it care which groups or classes are running the State in var- ious political regimes. Neither does it matter, for economics, whether the socialist regime chooses its rulers by elections or by coups d’etat . Economics is concerned only with the powers of ownership or control that the State exercises. All forms of State planning of the whole economy are types of socialism, notwith- standing the philosophical or esthetic viewpoints of the various socialist camps and regardless whether they are referred to as “rightists” or “leftists.” Socialism may be monarchical; it may be proletarian; it may equalize fortunes; it may increase inequality. Its essence is always the same: total coercive State dictation over the economy. The distance between the poles of the purely free market, on the one hand, and total collectivism on the other, is a contin- uum involving different “mixes” of the freedom principle and the coercive, hegemonic principle. Any increase of governmen- tal ownership or control, therefore, is “socialistic,” or “collec- tivistic,” because it is a coercive intervention bringing the econ- omy one step closer to complete socialism. The extent of collectivism in the twentieth century is at once under- and overestimated. On the one hand, its develop- ment in such countries as the United States is greatly under es- timated. Most observers neglect, for example, the importance of the expansion of government lending. The lender is also an entrepreneur and part owner, regardless of his legal status. Government loans to private enterprise, therefore, or guaran- tees of private loans, create many centers of government own- ership. Furthermore, the total quantity of savings in the econ- omy is not increased by government guarantees and loans, but its specific form is changed. The free market tends to allocate social savings to their most profitable and productive channels. Government loans and guarantees, by contrast, divert savings from more to less productive channels. They also prevent the 228 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"success of the most efficient entrepreneurs and the weeding out of the inefficient (who would then become simply labor factors rather than entrepreneurs). In both these ways, therefore, gov- ernment lending lowers the general standard of living—to say nothing of the loss of utility inflicted on the taxpayers, who must make these pledges good, or who supply the money to be loaned. On the other hand, the extent of socialism in such countries as Soviet Russia is over rated. Those people who point to Russia as an example of “successful” planning by the government ignore the fact (aside from the planning difficulties constantly encountered) that Soviet Russia and other socialist countries cannot have full socialism because only domestic trade is social- ized. The rest of the world still has a market of sorts. A social- ist State, therefore, can still buy and sell on the world market and at least vaguely approximate the rational pricing of produc- ers’ goods by referring to the prices of factors set on the world market. Although the errors of even this partial socialist plan- ning are impoverishing, they are insignificant compared to what would happen under the total calculational chaos of a world socialist State. One Big Cartel could not calculate and therefore could not be established on the free market. How much more does this apply to socialism, where the State imposes its overall monopoly by force, and where the inefficiencies of a single State’s actions are multiplied a thousandfold. One point should not be overlooked in the analysis of spe- cific socialist regimes: the possibility of a “black” market, with resources passing illicitly into private hands. 16 Of course, the opportunity for black markets in large-sized goods is rather lim- ited; there is more scope for such trade where commodities (like candy, cigarettes, drugs, and stockings) are easy to conceal.

There is reason to believe, for example, that extensive graft ( blat ) and black markets, i.e., the subversion of socialist planning, have been essential to the level of produc- tion which the Soviet system has been able to attain. In recent years, the total failure of socialist planning to cal- culate for an industrial economy has been implicitly acknowl- edged by the Communist countries, which have been rapidly moving, especially in Eastern Europe, away from socialism and toward an ever freer market economy. This progress has been particularly remarkable in Yugoslavia, which is now marked by private as well as producers’ co-operative ownership and by the absence of central planning, even of investments. 17 4. The Myth of “Public” Ownership We all hear a great deal about “public” ownership. When- ever the government owns property, in fact, or operates an enterprise, it is referred to as “publicly owned.” When natural resources are sold or given to private enterprise, we learn that the “public domain” has been “given away” to narrow private interests. The inference is that when the government owns any- thing, “we”—all members of the public—own equal shares of 230 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 17 On the Yugoslav experience, see Rudolf Bicanic, “Economics of Socialism in a Developed Country,” Foreign Affairs, July, 1966, pp. 632–50. See also Deborah D. Milenkovitch, “Which Direction for Yugoslavia’s Economy?” East Europe, July, 1969, pp. 13–19. Yugoslav economists are even thinking in terms of developing a stock market and refer to this latent development as “socialist people’s capitalism”! See the November 25, 1966, Research Report of Radio Free Europe. On the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism, see Mises, Human Action ; F.A. Hayek, ed., Collectivist Economic Planning (New York: Augus- tus M. Kelley, 1967); and Trygve Hoff, Economic Calculation in the Social- ist Society (London: William Hodge & Co., 1949)."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"that property. Contrast to this broad sweep the narrow, petty interests of mere “private” ownership. We have seen that, since a socialist economic system could not calculate economically, a die-hard socialist must be pre- pared to witness the disappearance of a large part of the earth’s population, with only primitive subsistence remaining for the survivors. Still, a man who identifies government with public ownership might be content to spread the area of government ownership despite the loss of efficiency or social utility it entails. The identity itself, however, is completely fallacious. Own- ership is the ultimate control and direction of a resource. The owner of a property is its ultimate director, regardless of legal fictions to the contrary. In the purely free society, resources so abundant as to serve as general conditions of human welfare would remain unowned. Scarce resources, on the other hand, would be owned on the following principles: self-ownership of each person by himself; self-ownership of a person’s created or transformed property; first ownership of previously unowned land by its first user or transformer. Government ownership means simply that the ruling officialdom owns the property. The top officials are the ones who direct the use of the prop- erty, and they therefore do the owning . The “public” owns no part of the property. Any citizen who doubts this may try to appropriate for his own individual use his aliquot part of “pub- lic” property and then try to argue his case in court. It may be objected that individual stockholders of corporations cannot do this either, e.g., by the rules of the company, a General Motors stockholder is not allowed to seize a car in lieu of cash dividends or in exchange for his stock. Yet stockholders do own their com- pany, and this example precisely proves our point. For the stockholder can contract out of his company; he can sell his shares of General Motors’ stock to someone else. The subject of a government cannot contract out of that government; he can- not sell his “shares” in the post office because he has no such shares. As F.A. Harper has succinctly stated: “The corollary of Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 231"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"the right of ownership is the right of disownership. So if I can- not sell a thing, it is evident that I do not really own it.” 18 Whatever the form of government, the rulers are the true owners of the property. However, in a democracy or, in the long run under any form of government, the rulers are transitory. They can always lose an election or be overthrown by a coup d’e- tat . Hence, no government official regards himself as more than a transitory owner. As a result, while a private owner, secure in his property and owning its capital value, plans the use of his resource over a long period of time, the government official must milk the property as quickly as he can, since he has no security of ownership. Further, even the entrenched civil ser- vant must do the same, for no government official can sell the capitalized value of his property, as private owners can. In short, government officials own the use of resources, but not their cap- ital value (except in the case of the “private property” of a hereditary monarch). When only the current use can be owned, but not the resource itself, there will quickly ensue uneconomic exhaustion of the resources, since it will be to no one’s benefit to conserve it over a period of time and to every owner’s advan- tage to use it up as quickly as possible. In the same way, gov- ernment officials will consume their property as rapidly as pos- sible. It is curious that almost all writers parrot the notion that pri- vate owners, possessing time preference, must take the “short view,” while only government officials can take the “long view” and allocate property to advance the “general welfare.” The truth is exactly the reverse. The private individual, secure in his property and in his capital resource, can take the long view, for he wants to maintain the capital value of his resource. It is the 232 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 18 F.A. Harper, Liberty, a Path to Its Recovery (Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1949), pp. 106, 132.

Democracy Democracy is a process of choosing government rulers or policies and is therefore distinct from what we have been con- sidering: the nature and consequences of various policies that a government may choose. A democracy can choose relatively laissez-faire or relatively interventionist programs, and the same is true for a dictator. And yet the problem of forming a govern- ment cannot be absolutely separated from the policy that gov- ernment pursues, and so we shall discuss some of these connec- tions here. Democracy is a system of majority rule in which each citizen has one vote either in deciding the policies of the government or in electing the rulers, who will in turn decide policy. It is a system replete with inner contradictions. In the first place, suppose that the majority overwhelmingly wishes to establish a popular dictator or the rule of a single party. The people wish to surrender all decision-making into his or its hands. Does the system of democracy permit itself to be voted democratically out of existence? Whichever way the democrat answers, he is caught in an inescapable contradiction. If the majority can vote into power a dictator who will end fur- ther elections, then democracy is really ending its own exis- tence. From then on, there is no longer democracy, although there is continuing majority consent to the dictatorial party or Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 233 19 Those who object that private individuals are mortal, but that “gov- ernments are immortal,” indulge in the fallacy of “conceptual realism” at its starkest. “Government” is not a real acting entity but is a real category of action adopted by actual individuals. It is a name for a type of action, the regularization of a type of interpersonal relation, and is not itself an acting being."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"ruler. Democracy, in that case, becomes a transition to a nonde- mocratic form of government. On the other hand, if, as it is now fashionable to maintain, the majority of voters in a democracy are prohibited from doing one thing—ending the democratic elective process itself—then this is no longer democracy, because the majority of voters can no longer rule. The election process may be preserved, but how can it express that majority rule essential to democracy if the majority cannot end this process should it so desire? In short, democracy requires two conditions for its existence: majority rule over governors or policies, and periodic, equal voting. So if the majority wishes to end the voting process, democracy cannot be preserved regard- less of which horn of the dilemma is chosen. The idea that the “majority must preserve the freedom of the minority to become the majority” is then seen, not as a preservation of democracy, but as simply an arbitrary value judgment on the part of the political scientist (or at least it remains arbitrary until justified by some cogent ethical theory). 20 This dilemma occurs not only if the majority wishes to select a dictator, but also if it desires to establish the purely free society that we have outlined above. For that society has no overall monopoly-government organization, and the only place where equal voting would obtain would be in co-opera- tives, which have always been inefficient forms of organization. The only important form of voting, in that society, would be 234 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 20 This idea that democracy must force the majority to permit the minority the freedom to become a majority, is an attempt by social dem- ocratic theorists to permit those results of democracy which they like (economic interventionism, socialism), while avoiding the results which they do not like (interference with “human rights,” freedom of speech, etc.). They do this by trying to elevate their value judgments into an allegedly “scientific” definition of democracy. Aside from the self-contra- diction, this limitation is itself not as rigorous as they believe. It would permit a democracy, for example, to slaughter Negroes or redheads, because there is no chance that such minority groups could become majorities.

Each individual’s vote, in that case, would be meaningfully tied to his share in the ownership of joint assets. 21 In such a purely free society there would be nothing for democratic electors to vote about . Here, too, democracy can be only a possible route toward a free society, rather than an attribute of it. Neither is democracy conceivably workable under socialism. The ruling party, owning all means of production, will have the complete decision, for example, on how much funds to allocate to the opposition parties for propaganda, not to speak of its eco- nomic power over all the individual leaders and members of the opposition. With the ruling party deciding the income of every man and the allocation of all resources, it is inconceivable that any functioning political opposition could long persist under socialism. 22 The only opposition that could emerge would be Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 235 21 To Spencer Heath, this is the only genuine form of democracy: When persons contractually pool their separate titles to property by taking undivided interests in the whole, they elect servants—officers—and otherwise exercise their authority over their property by a process of voting, as partners, share owners or other beneficiaries. This is authentically democratic in that all the members exercise authority in proportion to their respective contributions. Coercion is not employed against any, and all persons are as free to withdraw their membership and property as they were to contribute it. (Heath, Citadel, Market, and Altar , p. 234) 22 Even if, as is highly unlikely—especially in view of the fact that rulers under socialism are those most adept at wielding force—the social- ist leaders were saintly men, wishing to give a political opposition every chance, and even if the opposition were unusually heroic and risked liq- uidation by emerging into the open, how would the rulers decide their allocations? Would they give funds and resources to all opposing parties? Or only to a pro-socialist opposition? How much would they allocate to each opposition party?"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"not opposing parties in an election, but different administrative cliques within the ruling party, as has been true in the Commu- nist countries. Thus, democracy is compatible neither with the purely free society nor with socialism. And yet we have seen in this work (and shall see further below) that only those two societies are stable, that all intermediary mixtures are in “unstable equilib- rium” and always tending toward one or the other pole. This means that democracy, in essence, is itself an unstable and tran- sitional form of government. Democracy suffers from many more inherent contradictions as well. Thus, democratic voting may have either one of these two functions: to determine governmental policy or to select rulers. According to the former, what Schumpeter termed the “classical” theory of democracy, the majority will is supposed to rule on issues. 23 According to the latter theory, majority rule is supposed to be confined to choosing rulers, who in turn decide policy. While most political scientists support the latter version, democracy means the former version to most people, and we shall therefore discuss the classical theory first. According to the “will of the people” theory, direct democ- racy—voting on each issue by all the citizens, as in New Eng- land town meetings—is the ideal political arrangement. Mod- ern civilization and the complexities of society, however, are supposed to have outmoded direct democracy, so that we must settle for the less perfect “representative democracy” (in olden days often called a “republic”), where the people select repre- sentatives to give effect to their will on political issues. Logical problems arise almost immediately. One is that different forms of electoral arrangements, different delimitations of geograph- ical districts, all equally arbitrary, will often greatly alter the picture of the “majority will.” If a country is divided into dis- tricts for choosing representatives, then “gerrymandering” is 236 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 23 See Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy , passim ."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"inherent in such a division: there is no satisfactory, rational way of demarking the divisions. The party in power at the time of division, or redivision, will inevitably alter the districts to pro- duce a systematic bias in its favor; but no other way is inherently more rational or more truly evocative of majority will. More- over, the very division of the earth’s surface into countries is itself arbitrary. If a government covers a certain geographical area, does “democracy” mean that a majority group in a certain district should be permitted to secede and form its own govern- ment, or to join another country? Does democracy mean major- ity rule over a larger, or over a smaller, area? In short, which majority should prevail? The very concept of a national democ- racy is, in fact, self-contradictory. For if someone contends that the majority in Country X should govern that country, then it could be argued with equal validity that the majority of a certain district within Country X should be allowed to govern itself and secede from the larger country, and this subdividing process can logically proceed down to the village block, the apartment house, and, finally, each individual, thus marking the end of all democratic government through reduction to individual self- government. But if such a right of secession is denied, then the national democrat must concede that the more numerous pop- ulation of other countries should have a right to outvote his country; and so he must proceed upwards to a world govern- ment run by a world majority rule. In short, the democrat who favors national government is self-contradictory; he must favor a world government or none at all. Aside from this problem of the geographical boundary of the government or electoral district, the democracy that tries to elect representatives to effect the majority will runs into fur- ther problems. Certainly some form of proportional represen- tation would be mandatory, to arrive at a kind of cross section of public opinion. Best would be a proportional representation scheme for the whole country—or world—so that the cross section is not distorted by geographic considerations. But here again, different forms of proportional representation will lead Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 237"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"to very different results. The critics of proportional representa- tion retort that a legislature elected on this principle would be unstable and that elections should result in a stable majority government. The reply to this is that, if we wish to represent the public, a cross section is required, and the instability of rep- resentation is only a function of the instability or diversity of public opinion itself. The “efficient government” argument can be pursued, therefore, only if we abandon the classical “major- ity-will” theory completely and adopt the second theory—that the only function of the majority is to choose rulers. But even proportional representation would not be as good—according to the classical view of democracy—as direct democracy, and here we come to another important and neg- lected consideration: modern technology does make it possible to have direct democracy. Certainly, each man could easily vote on issues several times per week by recording his choice on a device attached to his television set. This would not be difficult to achieve. And yet, why has no one seriously suggested a return to direct democracy, now that it may be feasible? The people could elect representatives through proportional representa- tion, solely as advisers, to submit bills to the people, but with- out having ultimate voting power themselves. The final vote would be that of the people themselves, all voting directly. In a sense, the entire voting public would be the legislature, and the representatives could act as committees to bring bills before this vast legislature. The person who favors the classical view of democracy must, therefore, either favor virtual eradication of the legislature (and, of course, of executive veto power) or aban- don his theory. The objection to direct democracy will undoubtedly be that the people are uninformed and therefore not capable of decid- ing on the complex issues that face the legislature. But, in that case, the democrat must completely abandon the classical the- ory that the majority should decide on issues , and adopt the modern doctrine that the function of democracy is majority 238 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"choice of rulers, who, in turn, will decide the policies. Let us, then, turn to this doctrine. It faces, fully as much as the classi- cal theory, the self-contradiction on national or electoral boundaries; and the “modern democrat” (if we may call him such), as much as the “classical democrat” must advocate world government or none at all. On the question of representation, it is true that the modern democrat can successfully oppose direct television-democracy, or even proportional representation, and resort to our current system of single constituencies. But he is caught in a different dilemma: if the only function of the voting people is to choose rulers, why have a legislature at all? Why not simply vote periodically for a chief executive, or President, and then call it a day? If the criterion is efficiency, and stable rule by a single party for the term of office, then a single exec- utive will be far more stable than a legislature, which may always splinter into warring groups and deadlock the govern- ment. The modern democrat, therefore, must also logically abandon the idea of a legislature and plump for granting all leg- islative powers to the elected executive. Both theories of democ- racy, it seems, must abandon the whole idea of a representative legislature. Furthermore, the “modern democrat” who scoffs at direct democracy on the ground that the people are not intelligent or informed enough to decide the complex issues of government, is caught in another fatal contradiction: he assumes that the people are sufficiently intelligent and informed to vote on the people who will make these decisions. But if a voter is not com- petent to decide issues A, B, C, etc., how in the world could he possibly be qualified to decide whether Mr. X or Mr. Y is better able to handle A, B, or C? In order to make this decision, the voter would have to know a great deal about the issues and know enough about the persons whom he is selecting. In short, he would probably have to know more in a representative than in a direct democracy. Furthermore, the average voter is necessarily less qualified to choose persons to decide issues than he is to vote on the issues themselves. For the issues are at least intelligible Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 239"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"to him, and he can understand some of their relevance; but the candidates are people whom he cannot possibly know person- ally and whom he therefore knows essentially nothing about. Hence, he can vote for them only on the basis of their external “personalities,” glamorous smiles, etc., rather than on their actual competence; as a result, however ill-informed the voter, his choice is almost bound to be less intelligent under a repre- sentative republic than in a direct democracy. 24,25 We have seen the problems that democratic theory has with the legislature. It also has difficulty with the judiciary. In the first place, the very concept of an “independent judiciary” con- tradicts the theory of democratic rule (whether classical or modern). If the judiciary is really independent of the popular will, then it functions, at least within its own sphere, as an oli- garchic dictatorship, and we can no longer call the government a “democracy.” On the other hand, if the judiciary is elected directly by the voters, or appointed by the voters’ representa- tives (both systems are used in the United States), then the judi- ciary is hardly independent. If the election is periodic, or if the appointment is subject to renewal, then the judiciary is no more independent of political processes than any other branch of government. If the appointment is for life, then the independ- ence is greater, although even here, if the legislature votes the funds for the judges’ salaries, or if it decides the jurisdiction of judicial powers, judicial independence may be sharply impaired. 240 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 24 The “modern democrat” might object that the candidate’s party affiliation enables the voter to learn, if not his personal competence, at least his political ideology. But the “modern democrat” is precisely the theorist who hails the current “two-party” system, in which the platforms of both parties are almost indistinguishable, as the most efficient, stable form of democratic government. 25 These considerations also serve to refute the contention of the “conservative” that a republic will avoid the inherent contradictions of a direct democracy—a position that itself stands in contradiction to its pro- ponents’ professed opposition to executive as against legislative power."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"We have not exhausted the problems and contradictions of democratic theory; and we may pursue the rest by asking: Why democracy anyway? Until now, we have been discussing various theories of how democracies should function, or what areas (e.g., issues or rulers) should be governed by the democratic process. We may now inquire about the theories that support and justify democracy itself. One theory, again of classical vintage, is that the majority will always, or almost always, make the morally right decisions (whether about issues or men). Since this is not an ethical trea- tise, we cannot deal further with this doctrine, except to say that few people hold this view today. It has been demonstrated that people can democratically choose a wide variety of policies and rulers, and the experience of recent centuries has, for the most part, vitiated any faith that people may have had in the infalli- ble wisdom and righteousness of the average voter. Perhaps the most common and most cogent argument for democracy is not that democratic decisions will always be wise, but that the democratic process provides for peaceful change of government. The majority, so the argument runs, must support any government, regardless of form, if it is to continue existing for long; far better, then, to let the majority exercise this right peacefully and periodically than to force the majority to keep overturning the government through violent revolution. In short, ballots are hailed as substitutes for bullets. One flaw in this argument is that it completely overlooks the possibility of the nonviolent overthrow of the government by the majority through civil disobedience, i.e., peaceful refusal to obey gov- ernment orders. Such a revolution would be consistent with this argument’s ultimate end of preserving peace and yet would not require democratic voting. 26 Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 241 26 Thus Etienne de La Boétie: Obviously there is no need of fighting to overcome this sin- gle tyrant, for he is automatically defeated if the country"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"There is, moreover, another flaw in the “peaceful-change” argument for democracy, this one being a grave self-contradic- tion that has been universally overlooked. Those who have adopted this argument have simply used it to give a seal of approval to all democracies and have then moved on quickly to other matters. They have not realized that the “peaceful- change” argument establishes a criterion for government before which any given democracy must pass muster. For the argument that ballots are to substitute for bullets must be taken in a pre- cise way: that a democratic election will yield the same result as would have occurred if the majority had had to battle the minor- ity in violent combat. In short, the argument implies that the election results are simply and precisely a substitute for a test of physical combat. Here we have a criterion for democracy: Does it really yield the results that would have been obtained through civil combat? If we find that democracy, or a certain form of democracy, leads systematically to results that are very wide of this “bullet-substitute” mark, then we must either reject democ- racy or give up the argument. How, then, does democracy, either generally or in specific countries, fare when we test it against its own criterion? One of the essential attributes of democracy, as we have seen, is that each man have one vote. 27 But the “peaceful-change” argument 242 Power and Market: Government and the Economy refuses consent to its own enslavement: it is not necessary to deprive him of anything, but simply to give him noth- ing; there is no need that the country make an effort to do anything for itself provided it does nothing against itself. It is therefore the inhabitants themselves who permit, or rather, bring about, their own subjection, since by ceasing to submit they could put an end to their servitude. (La Boétie, Anti-Dictator , pp. 8–9) 27 Even though, in practice, votes of rural or other areas are often more heavily weighted, this democratic ideal is roughly approximated, or at least is the general aspiration, in the democratic countries."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"implies that each man would have counted equally in any com- bat test. But is this true? In the first place, it is clear that physi- cal power is not equally distributed. In any test of combat, women, old people, sick people, and 4F’s would fare very badly. On the basis of the “peaceful-change” argument, therefore, there is no justification whatever for giving these physically fee- ble groups the vote. So, barred from voting would be all citizens who could not pass a test, not for literacy (which is largely irrel- evant to combat prowess), but for physical fitness. Furthermore, it clearly would be necessary to give plural votes to all men who have been militarily trained (such as soldiers and policemen), for it is obvious that a group of highly trained fighters could easily defeat a far more numerous group of equally robust ama- teurs. In addition to ignoring the inequalities of physical power and combat fitness, democracy fails, in another significant way, to live up to the logical requirements of the “peaceful-change” thesis. This failure stems from another basic inequality: inequality of interest or intensity of belief. Thus, 60 percent of the population may oppose a certain policy, or political party, while only 40 percent favor it. In a democracy, this latter policy or party will be defeated. But suppose that the bulk of the 40 percent are passionate enthusiasts for the measure or candidate, while the bulk of the 60 percent majority have only slight inter- est in the entire affair. In the absence of democracy, far more of the passionate 40 percent would have been willing to engage in a combat test than would the apathetic 60 percent. And yet, in a democratic election, one vote by an apathetic, only faintly interested person offsets the vote of a passionate partisan. Hence, the democratic process grievously and systematically distorts the results of the hypothetical combat test. It is probable that no voting procedure could avoid this dis- tortion satisfactorily and serve as any sort of accurate substitute for bullets. But certainly much could be done to alter current voting procedures to bring them closer to the criterion, and it is Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 243"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"surprising that no one has suggested such reforms. The whole trend of existing democracies, for example, has been to make voting easier for the people; but this violates the bullet-substi- tute test directly, because it has been made ever easier for the apathetic to register their votes and thus distort the results. Clearly, what would be needed is to make voting far more diffi- cult and thus insure that only the most intensely interested peo- ple will vote. A moderately high poll tax, not large enough to keep out those enthusiasts who could not afford to pay, but large enough to discourage the indifferent, would be very help- ful. Voting booths should certainly be further apart; the person who refuses to travel any appreciable distance to vote would surely not have fought in his candidate’s behalf. Another useful step would be to remove all names from the ballot, thereby requiring the voters themselves to write in the names of their favorites. Not only would this procedure eliminate the decid- edly undemocratic special privilege that the State gives to those whose names it prints on the ballot (as against all other per- sons), but it would bring elections closer to our criterion, for a voter who does not know the name of his candidate would hardly be likely to fight in the streets on his behalf. Another indicated reform would be to abolish the secrecy of the ballot. The ballot has been made secret in order to protect the fearful from intimidation; yet civil combat is peculiarly the province of the courageous. Surely, those not courageous enough to pro- claim their choice openly would not have been formidable fighters in the combat test. These and doubtless other reforms would be necessary to move the election results to a point approximating the results of a combat foregone. And yet, if we define democracy as includ- ing equal voting, this means that democracy simply cannot meet its own criterion as deduced from the “peaceful-change” argu- ment. Or, if we define democracy as majority voting, but not necessarily equal, then the advocates of democracy would have to favor: abolishing the vote for women, sick people, old people, etc.; plural voting for the militarily trained; poll taxes; the open 244 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"vote; etc. In any case, democracy such as we have known it, marked by equal voting for each person, is directly contradicted by the “peaceful-change” argument. One or the other, the argu- ment or the system, must be abandoned. If the arguments for democracy are thus shown to be a maze of fallacy and contradiction, does this mean that democracy must be completely abandoned, except on the basis of a purely arbitrary, unsupported value judgment that “democracy is good”? Not necessarily, for democracy may be thought of, not so much as a value in itself , but as a possible method for achiev- ing other desired ends. The end may be either to put a certain political leader into power or to attain desired governmental policies. Democracy, after all, is simply a method of choosing governors and issues, and it is not so surprising that it might have value largely to the extent that it serves as a means to other political ends. The socialist and the libertarian, for example, while recognizing the inherent instability of the democratic form, may favor democracy as a means of arriving at a socialist or a libertarian society. The libertarian might thus consider democracy as a useful way of protecting people against govern- ment or of advancing individual liberty. 28 One’s views of democ- racy, then, depend upon one’s estimates of the given circum- stances. Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 245 28 Some libertarians consider a constitution a useful device for limiting or preventing governmental encroachments on individual liberty. A major difficulty with this idea was pointed out with great clarity by John C. Cal- houn: that no matter how strict the limitations placed on government by a written constitution, these limits must be constantly weakened and expanded if the final power to interpret them is placed in the hands of an organ of the government itself (e.g., the Supreme Court).

A PPENDIX T HE R OLE OF G OVERNMENT E XPENDITURES IN N ATIONAL P RODUCT S TATISTICS 29 National product statistics have been used widely in recent years as a reflection of the total product of society and even to indicate the state of “economic welfare.” These statistics cannot be used to frame or test economic theory, for one thing because they are an inchoate mixture of grossness and netness and because no objectively measurable “price level” exists that can be used as an accurate “deflator” to obtain statistics of some form of aggregate physical output. National product statistics, however, may be useful to the economic historian in describing or analyzing an historical period. Even so, they are highly mis- leading as currently used. Private product is appraised at exchange values set by the market, and difficulty occurs even here. The major trouble, however, enters with the appraisal of the role of the government in contributing to the national product. What is the govern- ment’s contribution to the product of society? Originally, national income statisticians were split on this issue. Simon Kuznets evaluated government services as equal to the taxes paid, assuming that government is akin to private business and that government receipts, like the receipts of a firm, reflect the market-appraised value of its product. The error in treating government like a private business should be clear by this point in our discussion. Now generally adopted is the Department of Commerce method of appraising government services as equal to their “cost,” i.e., to government expenditures on the salaries of its officials and on commodities purchased from private enterprise. The difference is that all governmental deficits are included by the Department in the government’s “contribution” 246 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"to the national product. The Department of Commerce method fallaciously assumes that the government’s “product” is measurable by what the government spends. On what possible basis can this assumption be made? Actually, since governmental services are not tested on the free market, there is no possible way of measuring government’s alleged “productive contribution.” All government services, as we have seen, are monopolized and inefficiently supplied. Clearly, if they are worth anything, they are worth far less than their cost in money. Furthermore, the government’s tax revenue and deficit revenue are both burdens imposed on production, and the nature of this burden should be recognized. Since gov- ernment activities are more likely to be depredations upon, rather than contributions to, production, it is more accurate to make the opposite assumption: namely, that government con- tributes nothing to the national product and its activities sap the national product and channel it into unproductive uses. In using “national product” statistics, then, we must cor- rect for the inclusion of government activities in the national product. From net national product, we first deduct “income originating in government,” i.e., the salaries of government officials. We must also deduct “income originating in govern- ment enterprises.” These are the current expenditures or salaries of officials in government enterprises that sell their product for a price. (National income statistics unfortunately include these accounts in the private rather than in the gov- ernmental sector.) This leaves us with net private product, or NPP. From NPP we must deduct the depredations of govern- ment in order to arrive at private product remaining in private hands, or PPR. These depredations consist of: ( a ) purchases from business by government; ( b ) purchases from business by government enterprises; and ( c ) transfer payments. 30 The Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 247 30 Purchases from business should be deducted gross of government sales to the public, rather than net, for government sales are simply equivalent to tax revenue in absorbing money from the private sector."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"total of these depredations, divided by NPP, yields the per- centage of government depredation on the private product. A simpler guide to the fiscal impact of government on the econ- omy would be to deduct the total expenditures of government and government enterprises from the NNP (these expendi- tures equalling income originating in government and gov- ernment enterprises, added to the total depredations). This figure would be an estimate of total government depredation on the economy. Of course, taxes and revenues of government enterprises could be deducted instead from the NNP, and the result would be the same in accordance with double-entry principles, pro- vided that a government deficit is also deducted. On the other hand, if there is a surplus in the government budget, then this surplus should be deducted as well as expenditures, since it too absorbs funds from the private sector. In short, either total gov- ernment expenditures or total government receipts (each figure inclusive of government enterprises) should be deducted from NNP, whichever is the higher. The resulting figures will yield an approximation of the impact of the government’s fiscal affairs on the economy. A more precise estimate, as we have seen, would compare total depredations proper with gross private product. In subtracting government expenditures from the gross national product, we note that government transfer payments are included in this deduction. Professor Due would dispute this procedure on the ground that transfer activities are not included in the national product figures. But the important con- sideration is that taxes (and deficits) to finance transfer pay- ments do act as a drain on the national product and therefore must be subtracted from NNP to yield PPR. In gauging the rel- ative size of governmental vis-à-vis private activity, Due warns that the sum of governmental expenditures should not include transfer payments, which “merely shift purchasing power” without using up resources. Yet this “mere shift” is as much a burden upon the producers—as much a shift from voluntary 248 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"production to State-created privilege—as any other govern- mental expenditure. 31 Binary Intervention: Government Expenditures 249 31 Due, Government Finance , pp. 76–77.

Introduction: Praxeological Criticism of Ethics P RAXEOLOGY — ECONOMICS — PROVIDES NO ULTIMATE ethical judgments: it simply furnishes the indispensable data necessary to make such judgments. It is a formal but universally valid sci- ence based on the existence of human action and on logical deductions from that existence. And yet praxeology may be extended beyond its current sphere, to criticize ethical goals. This does not mean that we abandon the value neutrality of praxeological science. It means merely that even ethical goals must be framed meaningfully and, therefore, that praxeology can criticize (1) existential errors made in the formulation of ethical propositions and (2) the possible existential meaning- lessness and inner inconsistency of the goals themselves. If an ethical goal can be shown to be self-contradictory and conceptu- ally impossible of fulfillment, then the goal is clearly an absurd one and should be abandoned by all. It should be noted that we are not disparaging ethical goals that may be practically unreal- izable in a given historical situation; we do not reject the goal of abstention from robbery simply because it is not likely to be completely fulfilled in the near future. What we do propose to discard are those ethical goals that are conceptually impossible of fulfillment because of the inherent nature of man and of the universe. 251 6 A NTIMARKET E THICS : AP RAXEOLOGICAL C RITIQUE"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"We therefore propose to place a restriction on the unlimited validity of anyone’s ultimate ethical valuations. In doing so, we still are not pushing beyond the bounds of praxeology to func- tion as ethicists, for we are not here attempting to establish a positive ethical system of our own or even to prove that such a system is attainable. We believe only that praxeology should have the right of veto, to discard any ethical propositions that fail to meet the test of conceptual possibility or internal consis- tency. Furthermore, we maintain that whenever an ethical goal has been shown to be conceptually impossible and therefore absurd, it is equally absurd to take measures to approach that ideal . It is ille- gitimate to concede that X is an absurd goal, and then to go on to say that we should take all possible measures to approach it, at any rate. If the end is absurd, so is the approach toward that end; this is a praxeological truth derived from the law that a means can obtain its value only by being imputed from the end. 1 A drive toward X only obtains its value from the value of X itself; if the latter is absurd, then so is the former. There are two types of ethical criticisms that can be made of the free-market system. One type is purely existential; that is, it rests on existential premises only. The other type advances conflicting ethical goals and protests that the free market does not attain these goals. (Any mixture of the two will here be placed in the second category.) The first type says: (1) The free market leads to consequence A; (2) I don’t like consequence A 252 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 1 In short, we are saying that the means must be justified by the end. What else but an end can justify a means? The common conception that the doctrine, “the end justifies the means,” is an immoral device of Com- munists, is hopelessly confused. When, for example, people object to murder as a means to achieve goals, they are objecting to murder, not because they do not believe that means are justified by ends, but because they have conflicting ends—for example, the end that murder not be com- mitted. They may hold this view as an end-in-itself or because it is a means to other ends, such as upholding each man’s right to life."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"(or consequence A is objectively unlikable); (3) therefore, the free market should not be established. To refute this type of criticism, it is necessary only to refute the existential proposi- tion in the first part of the argument, and this is, admittedly, a purely praxeological task. The following are brief summaries of very common criti- cisms of the free market that can be refuted praxeologically and that, indeed, have been refuted, implicitly or explicitly, in other writings: (1) The free market causes business cycles and unemployment . Business cycles are caused by the governmental intervention of bank-credit expansion. Unemployment is caused by unions or government keeping wage rates above the free-market level. Only coercive intervention, not private spending, can bring about inflation. (2) The free market is likely to bring about monopoly and monop- oly pricing. If we define “monopoly” as the “single seller of a product,” we founder on insoluble problems. We cannot iden- tify homogeneous products, except in the concrete day-to-day valuations of consumers. Furthermore, if we consider such monopoly as wicked, we must regard both Crusoe and Friday as vicious monopolists if they exchange fish and lumber on their desert island. But if Crusoe and Friday are not wicked, how can a more complex society, one necessarily less monopolistic in this sense, be at all wicked? At what point in the reduced scope of such monopoly can it be considered evil? And how can the mar- ket be held responsible for the number of people inhabiting the society? Moreover, every individual striving to be better than his fellows is thereby trying to be a “monopolist.” Is this bad? Do not both he and the rest of society benefit from his better mousetrap? Finally, there is no conceptually identifiable monopoly or monopolistic price on the free market. Hence, a monopoly price and a monopoly by any usable definition arise only through the coercive grant of exclusive Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 253"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"privilege by the government, and this includes all attempts to “enforce competition.” 2 (3) The government must do what the people themselves cannot do. We have shown that no such cases can exist. There are other criticisms, however, which infuse various degrees of ethical protest into the argument. This chapter will be devoted to a praxeological critique of some of the most pop- ular of these antimarket ethical contentions. 2. Knowledge of Self-Interest: An Alleged Critical Assumption This criticism of the market is more existential than ethical. It is the popular argument that laissez faire , or the free-market economy, rests its case on the crucial assumption that every individual knows his own self-interest best. Yet, it is charged, this is not true of many individuals. Therefore, the State must intervene, and the case for the free market is vitiated. The free-market doctrine, however, does not rest on any such assumption. Like the mythical “economic man,” the Perfectly Wise Individual is a straw man created by the critics of the the- ory, not implied by it. First, it should be evident from our analysis of the free mar- ket and government intervention throughout this work that any argument for the free market rests on a far deeper and more complex doctrine. We cannot enter here into the many ethical and philosophical arguments for freedom. Secondly, the laissez- faire or free-market doctrine does not assume that everyone always knows his own interest best; it asserts rather that every- one should have the right to be free to pursue his own interest as he deems best . Critics may argue that the government should force men to lose some ex ante or present utility in order to gain ex post utility later, by being compelled to pursue their own best interests. But libertarians may well reply in rebuttal: (1) that a 254 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 2 For further discussion, see Man, Economy, and State, chapter 10."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"person’s resentment at coercive interference will lower his ex post utility in any event; and (2) that the condition of freedom is a vital, necessary prerequisite for a person’s “best interests” to be attained. Indeed, the only lasting way to correct a person’s errors is by persuasive reasoning; force cannot do the job. As soon as the individual can evade this force, he will return to his own preferred ways. No one, certainly, has perfect foresight into the uncertain future. But free entrepreneurs on the market are better equipped than anyone else, by incentive and by economic cal- culation, to foresee and satisfy the needs of the consumers. But what if the consumers are mistaken with regard to their own interests? Obviously, they sometimes are. But several more points must be made. In the first place, every individual knows the data of his own inner self best—by the very fact that each has a separate mind and ego. Secondly, the individual, if in doubt about what his own true interests are, is free to hire and consult experts to give him advice based on their superior knowledge. The individual hires these experts and, on the market, can con- tinuously test their helpfulness. Individuals on the market, in short, tend to patronize those experts whose advice proves most successful. Good doctors or lawyers reap rewards on the free market, while poor ones fail. But when government intervenes, the government expert acquires his revenue by compulsory levy. There is no market test of his success in teaching people their true interests. The only test is his success in acquiring the polit- ical support of the State’s machinery of coercion. Thus, the privately hired expert flourishes in proportion to his ability, whereas the government expert flourishes in propor tion to his success in currying political favor. Moreover, what incen- tive does the government expert have to care about the interests of his subjects? Surely he is not especially endowed with supe- rior qualities by virtue of his government post. He is no more virtuous than the private expert; indeed, he is inherently less capable and is more inclined to wield coercive force. But while Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 255"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"the private expert has every pecuniary incentive to care about his clients or patients, the government expert has no incentive whatever. He obtains his revenue in any event. He is devoid of any incentive to worry about his subject’s true interests. It is curious that people tend to regard government as a quasi-divine, selfless, Santa Claus organization. Government was constructed neither for ability nor for the exercise of loving care; government was built for the use of force and for neces- sarily demagogic appeals for votes. If individuals do not know their own interests in many cases, they are free to turn to pri- vate experts for guidance. It is absurd to say that they will be served better by a coercive, demagogic apparatus. Finally, the proponents of government intervention are trapped in a fatal contradiction: they assume that individuals are not competent to run their own affairs or to hire experts to advise them. And yet they also assume that these same individ- uals are equipped to vote for these same experts at the ballot box. We have seen that, on the contrary, while most people have a direct idea and a direct test of their own personal interests on the market, they cannot understand the complex chains of prax- eological and philosophical reasoning necessary for a choice of rulers or political policies. Yet this political sphere of open dem- agogy is precisely the only one where the mass of individuals are deemed to be competent! 3, 4 256 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 3 Interventionists assume the political (but no other) competence of the people even when they favor dictatorship rather than democracy. For if the people do not vote under a dictatorship, they still must accept the rule of the dictator and his experts. So the interventionists cannot escape this contradiction even if they give up democracy. 4 Ludwig von Mises has been active in pointing out this contradiction. Thus, see his Planning for Freedom (South Holland, Ill.: Libertarian Press, 1952), pp. 42–43. However, the remainder of Mises’ criticism of this anti- market argument ( ibid ., pp. 40–44) rather differs from the one presented here."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"3. The Problem of Immoral Choices Some writers are astute enough to realize that the market economy is simply a resultant of individual valuations, and thus they see that, if they do not like the results, the fault lies with the valuations, not the economic system. Yet they proceed to advocate government intervention to correct the immorality of individual choices. If people are immoral enough to choose whiskey rather than milk, cosmetics rather than educational matter, then the State, they say, should step in and correct these choices. Much of the rebuttal parallels the refutation of the knowledge-of-interests argument; i.e., it is self-contradictory to contend that people cannot be trusted to make moral decisions in their daily lives but can be trusted to vote for or accept lead- ers who are morally wiser than they. Mises states, quite rightly, that anyone who advocates gov- ernmental dictation over one area of individual consumption must logically come to advocate complete totalitarian dictation over all choices. This follows if the dictators have any set of val- uational principles whatever. Thus, if the members of the ruling group like Bach and hate Mozart, and they believe strongly that Mozartian music is immoral, they are just as right in prohibit- ing the playing of Mozart as they are in prohibiting drug use or liquor consumption. 5 Many statists, however, would not balk at Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 257 5 Mises, Human Action , pp. 728–29. The same total dictatorship over consumer choice is also implied by the knowledge-of-interest argument discussed above. As Thomas Barber astutely says: It is illegal for pleasure-boaters to fail to carry a life pre- server for every person on board. A great number of young men are publicly employed to go about and look for violators of this law. Pleasant for the young men, of course. But is it really any more the government’s business that a man goes canoeing without a life preserver than that he goes out in the rain without his rubbers? . . . The law is irritating to the individual concerned, costly to the"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"this conclusion and would be willing to take over this congenial task. The utilitarian position—that government dictation is bad because no rational ethics exists, and therefore no person has a right to impose his arbitrary values on someone else—is, we believe, an inadequate one. In the first place, it will not convince those who believe in a rational ethics, who believe that there is a scientific basis for moral judgments and that they are not pure whim. And furthermore, the position involves a hidden moral assumption of its own—that A has no right to impose any arbi- trary values on B. But if ends are arbitrary, is not the end “that arbitrary whims not be imposed by coercion” just as arbitrary? And suppose, further, that ranking high on A’s value scale is the arbitrary whim of imposing his other values on B. Then the utili- tarians cannot object and must abandon their attempt to defend individual liberty in a value-free manner. In fact, the utilitarians are helpless against the man who wants to impose his values by coercion and who persists in doing so even after the various economic consequences are pointed out to him. 6 The would-be dictator can be logically refuted in a com- pletely different way, even while remaining within Wertfrei praxeological bounds. For what is the complaint of the would- be dictator against free individuals? That they act immorally in various ways. The dictator’s aim, therefore, is to advance moral- ity and combat immorality. Let us grant, for the sake of argu- ment, that an objective morality can be arrived at. The question that must be faced, then, is: Can force advance morality ? Suppose 258 Power and Market: Government and the Economy taxpayers, and turns a lot of potential producers into eco- nomic parasites. Perhaps the manufacturers of life pre- servers engineered its passage. (Barber, Where We Are At, p. 89) 6 It is true that we do not advocate ends in this volume , and in that sense praxeology is “utilitarian.” But the difference is that utilitarianism would extend this Wertfrei injunction from its proper place in economics and praxeology to embrace all of rational discourse."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"we arrive at the demonstrable conclusion that actions A, B, and C are immoral, and actions X, Y, and Z are moral. And suppose we find that Mr. Jones shows a distressing propensity to value A, B, and C highly and adopts these courses of action time and again. We are interested in transforming Mr. Jones from being an immoral person to being a moral person. How can we go about it? The statists answer: by force. We must prohibit at gun- point Mr. Jones from doing A, B, and C. Then , at last, he will be moral. But will he? Is Jones moral because he chooses X when he is forcibly deprived of the opportunity to choose A? When Smith is confined to a prison, is he being moral because he does- n’t spend his time in saloons getting drunk? There is no sense to any concept of morality, regardless of the particular moral action one favors, if a man is not free to do the immoral as well as the moral thing. If a man is not free to choose, if he is compelled by force to do the moral thing, then, on the contrary, he is being deprived of the opportunity of being moral. He has not been permitted to weigh the alternatives, to arrive at his own conclusions, and to take his stand. If he is deprived of free choice, he is acting under the dictator’s will rather than his own. (Of course, he could choose to be shot, but this is hardly an intelligible conception of free choice of alter- natives. In fact, he then has only one free choice: the hegemonic one—to be shot or to obey the dictator in all things.) Dictatorship over consumers’ choices, then, can only atrophy morality rather than promote it. There is but one way that morality can spread from the enlightened to the unenlight- ened—and that is by rational persuasion. If A convinces B through the use of reason that his moral values are correct and B’s are wrong, then B will change and adopt the moral course of his own free will. To say that this method is a slower procedure is beside the point. The point is that morality can spread only through peaceful persuasion and that the use of force can only erode and impair morality.

And, because this is not a treatise on ethics, we have not mentioned the libertarian ethical theory which holds that the use of coercion is itself the highest form of immorality . Thus, we have shown that would-be dictators must necessar- ily fail to achieve their professed goal of advancing morality because the consequences will be precisely the opposite. It is possible, of course, that the dictators are not really sincere in stating their goal; perhaps their true purpose is to wield power over others and to prevent others from being happy. In that case, of course, praxeology can say no more about the matter, although ethics may find a good deal to say. 7 4. The Morality of Human Nature It is very common to assert that the advocates of the purely free market make one fundamental and shaky assumption: that all human beings are angels. In a society of angels, it is com- monly agreed, such a program could “work,” but not in our fal- lible world. The chief difficulty with this criticism is that no lib- ertarian—except possibly those under Tolstoyan influence—has ever made such an assumption. The advocates of the free market 260 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 7 Mises often states that interventionary measures in the market, e.g., price controls, will have consequences that even the government officials administering the plans would consider bad. But the problem is that we do not know what the government officials’ ends are— except that they demonstrably do like the power they have acquired and the wealth they have extracted from the public.

We have seen that libertarians envision defense services against predators as provided by private bodies rather than by the State. But they do not assume that crime would magically disappear in the free society. Statists concede to libertarians that no State would be required if all men were “good.” State control is allegedly required only to the extent that men are “evil.” But what if all men were “evil”? As F.A. Harper has pointed out: Still using the same principle that political rulership should be employed to the extent of the evil in man, we would then have a society in which complete political rulership of all the affairs of everybody would be called for. . . . One man would rule all. But who would serve as the dictator? However he were to be selected and affixed to the political throne, he would surely be a totally evil person, since all men are evil. And this society would then be ruled by a totally evil dictator possessed of total political power. And how, in the name of logic, could anything short of total evil be its consequence? How could it be better than having no political rulership at all in that soci- ety? 8 Is this argument unrealistic because, as everyone agrees, human beings are a compound, capable of both good and evil? But then, at what point in this mixture does State dictation become necessary? In fact, the libertarian would reason that the fact that human nature is a mixture of both good and evil pro- vides its own particular argument in his favor.

What is considered “crime” socially, is called “exercise of democratic power” when performed by an individual as a State official. The purely free market, on the other hand, eliminates all legitimated channels for the exercise of power over man. 5. The Impossibility of Equality Probably the most common ethical criticism of the market economy is that it fails to achieve the goal of equality. Equality has been championed on various “economic” grounds, such as minimum social sacrifice or the diminishing marginal utility of money (see the chapter on taxation above). But in recent years economists have recognized that they cannot justify egalitarian- ism by economics, that they ultimately need an ethical basis for equality. Economics or praxeology cannot establish the validity of ethical ideals, but even ethical goals must be framed meaning- fully. They must therefore pass muster before praxeology as being internally consistent and conceptually possible. The cre- dentials of “equality” have so far not been adequately tested. It is true that many objections have been raised that give egalitarians pause. Sometimes realization of the necessary con- sequences of their policies causes an abandonment, though more often a slowing down, of the egalitarian program. Thus: compulsory equality will demonstrably stifle incentive, elimi- nate the adjustment processes of the market economy, destroy all efficiency in satisfying consumer wants, greatly lower capital formation, and cause capital consumption—all effects signifying a drastic fall in general standards of living. Furthermore, only a free society is casteless , and therefore only freedom will permit mobility of income according to productivity. Statism, on the other hand, is likely to freeze the economy into a mold of (non- productive) inequality. 262 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Yet these arguments, though powerful, are by no means con- clusive. Some people will pursue equality anyway; many will take these considerations into account by settling for some cuts in living standards in order to gain more equality. In all discussions of equality, it is considered self-evident that equality is a very worthy goal. But this is by no means self-evi- dent. For the very goal of equality itself is open to serious chal- lenge. The doctrines of praxeology are deduced from three uni- versally acceptable axioms: the major axiom of the existence of purposive human action; and the minor postulates, or axioms, of the diversity of human skills and natural resources, and the disu- tility of labor. Although it is possible to construct an economic theory of a society without these two minor axioms (but not without the major one), they are included in order to limit our theorizing to laws that can apply directly to reality. 9 Anyone who wants to set forth a theory applicable to interchangeable human beings is welcome to do so. Thus, the diversity of mankind is a basic postulate of our knowledge of human beings. But if mankind is diverse and indi- viduated, then how can anyone propose equality as an ideal? Every year, scholars hold Conferences on Equality and call for greater equality, and no one challenges the basic tenet. But what justification can equality find in the nature of man? If each indi- vidual is unique, how else can he be made “equal” to others than by destroying most of what is human in him and reducing human society to the mindless uniformity of the ant heap? It is the task of the egalitarian, who confidently enters the scene to inform the economist of his ultimate ethical goal, to prove his case. He must show how equality can be compatible with the nature of mankind and must defend the feasibility of a possible egalitarian world. But the egalitarian is in even direr straits, for it can be shown that equality of income is an impossible goal for mankind. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 263 9 For a further discussion of these axioms, see Rothbard, “In Defense of Extreme Apriorism,” Southern Economic Journal, January, 1957, pp. 314–20."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Income can never be equal. Income must be considered, of course, in real and not in money terms; otherwise there would be no true equality. Yet real income can never be equalized. For how can a New Yorker’s enjoyment of the Manhattan skyline be equalized with an Indian’s? How can the New Yorker swim in the Ganges as well as an Indian? Since every individual is nec- essarily situated in a different space, every individual’s real income must differ from good to good and from person to per- son. There is no way to combine goods of different types, to measure some income “level,” so it is meaningless to try to arrive at some sort of “equal” level. The fact must be faced that equality cannot be achieved because it is a conceptually impossi- ble goal for man, by virtue of his necessary dispersion in loca- tion and diversity among individuals. But if equality is an absurd (and therefore irrational ) goal, then any effort to approach equality is correspondingly absurd. If a goal is pointless, then any attempt to attain it is similarly pointless. Many people believe that, though equality of income is an absurd ideal, it can be replaced by the ideal of equality of oppor- tunity. Yet this, too, is as meaningless as the former concept. How can the New Yorker’s opportunity and the Indian’s oppor- tunity to sail around Manhattan, or to swim in the Ganges, be “equalized”? Man’s inevitable diversity of location effectively eliminates any possibility of equalizing “opportunity.” Blum and Kalven lapse into a common error 10 when they state that justice connotes equality of opportunity and that this equality requires that “the contestants start from the same mark,” so that the “game” be “fair.” Human life is not some sort of race or game in which each person should start from an iden- tical mark. It is an attempt by each man to be as happy as pos- sible. And each person could not begin from the same point, for the world has not just come into being; it is diverse and infi- nitely varied in its parts. The mere fact that one individual is 264 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 10 Blum and Kalven, Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation , pp. 501 ff."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"necessarily born in a different place from someone else immedi- ately insures that his inherited opportunity cannot be the same as his neighbor’s. The drive for equality of opportunity would also require the abolition of the family since different parents have unequal abilities; it would require the communal rearing of children. The State would have to nationalize all babies and raise them in State nurseries under “equal” conditions. But even here conditions cannot be the same, because different State offi- cials will themselves have different abilities and personalities. And equality can never be achieved because of necessary differ- ences of location. Thus, the egalitarian must not be permitted any longer to end discussion by simply proclaiming equality as an absolute ethical goal. He must first face all the social and economic con- sequences of egalitarianism and try to show that it does not clash with the basic nature of man. He must counter the argu- ment that man is not made for a compulsory ant heap existence. And, finally, he must recognize that the goals of equality of income and equality of opportunity are conceptually unrealiz- able and are therefore absurd. Any drive to achieve them is ipso facto absurd as well. Egalitarianism is, therefore, a literally senseless social philos- ophy. Its only meaningful formulation is the goal of “equality of liberty”—formulated by Herbert Spencer in his famous Law of Equal Freedom: “Every man has freedom to do all he wills, pro- vided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.” 11 This goal does not attempt to make every individual’s total con- dition equal—an absolutely impossible task; instead, it advocates liberty—a condition of absence of coercion over person and property for every man. 12 Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 265 11 Spencer, Social Statics , p. 121. 12 This goal has sometimes been phrased as “equality before the law,” or “equality of rights.” Yet both formulations are ambiguous and misleading. The former could be taken to mean equality of slavery as well as liberty and has, in fact, been so narrowed down in recent years as to be"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Yet even this formulation of equality has many flaws and could profitably be discarded. In the first place, it opens the door for ambiguity and for egalitarianism. In the second place, the term “equality” connotes measurable identity with a fixed, extensive unit. “Equal length” means identity of measurement with an objectively determinable unit. In the study of human action, whether in praxeology or social philosophy, there is no such quantitative unit, and hence there can be no such “equal- ity.” Far better to say that “each man should have X” than to say that “all men should be equal in X.” If someone wants to urge every man to buy a car, he formulates his goal in that way— “Every man should buy a car”—rather than in such terms as: “All men should have equality in car buying.” The use of the term “equality” is awkward as well as misleading. And finally, as Clara Dixon Davidson pointed out so cogently many years ago, Spencer’s Law of Equal Freedom is redundant. For if every man has freedom to do all that he wills, it follows from this very premise that no man’s freedom has been infringed or invaded. The whole second clause of the law after “wills” is redundant and unnecessary. 13 Since the formulation of Spencer’s Law, opponents of Spencer have used the qualifying clause to drive holes into the libertarian philosophy. Yet all this time they were hitting at an encumbrance, not at the essence of the law. The concept of “equality” has no rightful place in the “Law of Equal Freedom,” being replaceable by the logical quantifier “every.” The “Law of Equal Freedom” could well be renamed “The Law of Total Freedom.” 266 Power and Market: Government and the Economy of minor significance. The latter could be interpreted to mean any sort of “right,” including the “right to an equal income.” 13 “. . . the opening affirmation includes what follows, since, if any one did infringe upon the freedom of another, all would not be equally free.” Clara Dixon Davidson in Liberty , September 3, 1892, as quoted in Ben- jamin R.

The Problem of Security One of the most common ethical charges levelled at the free market is that it fails to provide “security.” It is said that the blessings of freedom must be weighed against the competing blessings of security—to be provided, of course, by the State. The first comment to make is that this world is a world of uncertainty. We shall never be able to forecast the future course of the world with precision. Every action, therefore, involves risk. This risk cannot be eliminated. The man who keeps cash balances suffers the risk that its purchasing power may dwindle; the man who invests suffers the risk of loss; and so forth. Yet the free market finds ways of voluntarily relieving risk as much as can possibly be done. In a free society there are three prime ways that men can alleviate uncertainty about the future: (1) By savings. These savings, whether invested in production or kept in cash balances, insure money for future needs. Invest- ing in production increases one’s future assets; cash balances insure that funds will be immediately available. (2) By entrepreneurship . The entrepreneurs, i.e., the capitalist- entrepreneurs, assume the bulk of the risks of the market and concomitantly relieve laborers of a great deal of risk. Imagine the universal risk if laborers could not be paid until the final product reached the consumers! The pain of waiting for future income, the risk in attempting to forecast consumer demands in the future, would be almost intolerable, especially for those laborers toiling in the most remote processes of production. It is difficult to see how anyone would embark on longer processes of production if he were forced to wait the entire length of the production period to earn any income. But the capitalist-entre- preneur pays him, instead, immediately and himself adopts the burden of waiting and forecasting future wants. The entrepre- neur then risks loss of his capital. Another method of entrepre- neurial assumption of risk takes place in futures markets, where hedging allows buyers and sellers of commodities to shift the risk of future price changes onto a body of specialized traders. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 267"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"(3) By insurance. Insurance is a basic method of pooling and abating risks on the market. While entrepreneurs assume the burdens of uncertainty, insurance takes care of actuarial risks, where stable collective frequencies can be arrived at and premi- ums can be charged accordingly. The State cannot provide absolute security. The slaves may have believed that their security was guaranteed by their master. But the master assumed the risk; if his income fell, then he could not provide security for his charges. A fourth way to provide security in a free society is by vol- untary charity . This charity, of necessity, comes out of production. It has been maintained that the State can provide security for the people better than the market because it can guarantee a minimum income for everyone. Yet the government can do no such thing. The State produces nothing; it can only confiscate the production of others. The State, therefore, can guarantee nothing; if the requisite minimum is not produced, the State will have to default on its pledges. Of course, the State can print all the money it wants, but it cannot produce the needed goods. Furthermore, the State cannot, in this way, provide security for every man alike. It can make some secure only at the expense of others . If A can be made more secure only by robbing B, B is made more insecure in the process. Hence, the State, even if pro- duction is not drastically reduced, cannot provide security for all, but only for some at the expense of others. Is there no way, then, that government—organized coer- cion—can provide security? Yes, but not in the absolute sense. Rather, it can provide a certain aspect of security, and only this aspect can be guaranteed to every man in the society. This is security against aggression. In fact, however, only a voluntary, free-market defense can provide this, since only such a non-Sta- tist type of defense agency does not itself engage in aggression. With each man acquiring security of person and property against attack, productivity and leisure are both immeasurably increased. Any State attempt to provide such security is an 268 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"anachronism, since the State itself constantly invades individual liberty and security. That type of security, then, which is open to every man in society, is not only compatible with, but is a corollary to, perfect freedom. Freedom and security against aggression are two sides of the same coin. It might still be objected that many people, even knowing that slavery or submission to dictation cannot bring absolute security, will still wish to rely on masters. But if they do so vol- untarily, the libertarian asks, why must they force others, who do not choose to submit to masters, to join them? 7. Alleged Joys of the Society of Status One common related criticism of the free market and free society (particularly among intellectuals who are conspicuously not craftsmen or peasants) is that, in contrast to the Happy Craftsmen and Happy Peasants of the Middle Ages, it has “alienated” man from his work and from his fellows and has robbed him of his “sense of belonging.” The status society of the Middle Ages is looked back upon as a Golden Age, when everyone was sure of his station in life, when craftsmen made the whole shoe instead of just contributing to part of its pro- duction, and when these “whole” laborers were enmeshed in a sense of belonging with the rest of society. In the first place, the society of the Middle Ages was not a secure one, not a fixed, unchanging hierarchy of status. 14 There was little progress , but there was much change . Dwelling as they did in clusters of local self-sufficiency, marked by a low standard of living, the people were ever threatened by famine. And Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 269 14 The present section is meant more as a logical critique of the theory of status than as a detailed account of society in the Middle Ages. For a cri- tique of a recent expression of the Happy Peasant myth, see Charles E. Sil- berman, The Myths of Automation (New York: Harper & Row, 1967), pp. 98–107."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"because of the relative absence of trade, a famine in one area could not be countered by purchasing food from another area. The absence of famine in capitalist society is not a providential coincidence. Secondly, because of the low living standards, very few members of the population were lucky enough to be born into the status of the Happy Craftsman, who could be really happy and secure in his work only if he were a craftsman to the King or the nobility (who, of course, earned their high status by the decidedly “unhappy” practice of permanent violence in domination over the mass of the exploited population). As for the common serf, one wonders whether, in his poverty-stricken, enslaved, and barren existence, he had even sufficient time and leisure to contemplate the supposed joys of his fixed post and his “sense of belonging.” And if there were a serf or two who did not wish to “belong” to his lord or master, that “belonging,” of course, was enforced by violence. Aside from these considerations, there is another problem which the society of status cannot surmount, and which indeed contributed a great deal to breaking up the feudal and mercan- tilist structures of the precapitalistic era. This was population growth. If everyone is assigned his appointed and inherited role in life, how can an increased population be fitted into the scheme? Where are they to be assigned, and who is to do the assigning? And wherever they are allocated, how can these new people be prevented from disrupting the whole assigned net- work of custom and status? In short, it is precisely in the fixed, noncapitalistic society of status that the Malthusian problem is ever present, at its ugliest, and where Malthusian “checks” to population must come into play. Sometimes the check is the natural one of famine and plague; in other societies, systematic infanticide is practiced. Perhaps if there were a modern return to the society of status, compulsory birth control would be the rule (a not impossible prognosis for the future). But in precapi- talist Europe, the population problem became a problem of an ever increasing number of people with no work to do and no 270 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"place to go, who therefore had to turn to begging or highway robbery. The proponents of the theory of modern “alienation” do not offer any reasoning to back up their assertions, which are there- fore simply dogmatic myths. Certainly, it is not self-evident that the craftsman, or better still, the primitive man who made everything that he consumed, was in some sense happier or “more whole” as a result of this experience. Although this is not a treatise on psychology, it might be noted that perhaps what gives the worker his sense of importance is his participation in what Isabel Paterson has called the “circuit of production.” In free-market capitalism he can, of course, participate in that cir- cuit in many more and varied ways than he could in the more primitive status society. Furthermore, the status society is a tragic waste of potential skill for the individual worker. There is, after all, no reason why the son of a carpenter should be particularly interested or skilled in carpentry. In the status society he faces only a dreary life of carpentry, regardless of his desires. In the free-market, capitalist society, though he is of course not guaranteed that he will be able to make a livelihood in any line of work that he wants to pursue, his opportunities to do work that he really likes are immeasurably, almost infinitely, expanded. As the division of labor expands, there are more and more varieties of skilled occupations that he can engage in, instead of having to be con- tent with only the most primitive skills. And in the free society he is free to try these tasks, free to move into whatever area he likes best. He has no freedom and no opportunity in the allegedly joyful society of status. Just as free capitalism enor- mously expanded the amount and variety of consumers’ goods and services available to mankind, so it vastly expanded the number and variety of jobs to be done and the skills that people can develop. The hullabaloo about “alienation” is, in fact, more than a glorification of the medieval craftsman. He, after all, bought his Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 271"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"food from the nearby land. It is actually an attack on the whole concept of the division of labor and an enshrining of primitive self-sufficiency. A return to such conditions could mean only the eradication of the bulk of today’s population and complete impoverishment for those remaining. Why “happiness” would nonetheless increase, we leave to the mythologists of status. But there is one final consideration which indicates that the vast majority of the people do not believe that they need prim- itive conditions and the slave’s sense of belonging to make them happy. For there is nothing, in a free society, to prevent those who wish from going off in separate communities and living primitively and “belongingly.” No one is forced to join the spe- cialized division of labor. Not only has almost no one aban- doned modern society to return to a happy, integrated life of fixed poverty, but those few intellectuals who did form commu- nal Utopias of one sort or another during the nineteenth cen- tury abandoned these attempts very quickly. And perhaps the most conspicuous non withdrawers from society are those very critics who use our modern “alienated” mass communications to denounce modern society. As we indicated at the end of the last section, a free society permits any who wish to enslave themselves to others to do so. But if they have a psychological need for a slave’s “sense of belonging,” why must other individ- uals without such a need be coerced into enslavement? 8. Charity and Poverty A common complaint is that the free market would not insure the elimination of poverty, that it would “leave people free to starve,” and that it is far better to be “kindhearted” and give “charity” free rein by taxing the rest of the populace in order to subsidize the poor and the substandard. In the first place, the “freedom-to-starve” argument confuses the “war against nature,” which we all conduct, with the prob- lem of freedom from interference by other persons. We are always “free to starve” unless we pursue our conquest of nature, 272 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"for that is our natural condition. But “freedom” refers to absence of molestation by other persons; it is purely an interpersonal problem. Secondly, it should also be clear that it is precisely voluntary exchange and free capitalism that have led to an enormous improvement in living standards. Capitalist production is the only method by which poverty can be wiped out. As we stressed above, production must come first, and only freedom allows peo- ple to produce in the best and most efficient way possible. Force and violence may “distribute,” but it cannot produce. Interven- tion hampers production, and socialism cannot calculate. Since production of consumer satisfactions is maximized on the free market, the free market is the only way to abolish poverty. Dic- tates and legislation cannot do so; in fact, they can only make matters worse. The appeal to “charity” is a truly ironic one. First, it is hardly “charity” to take wealth by force and hand it over to someone else. Indeed, this is the direct opposite of charity, which can only be an unbought, voluntary act of grace. Compulsory con- fiscation can only deaden charitable desires completely, as the wealthier grumble that there is no point in giving to charity when the State has already taken on the task. This is another illustration of the truth that men can become more moral only through rational persuasion, not through violence, which will, in fact, have the opposite effect. Furthermore, since the State is always inefficient, the amount and direction of the giving will be much different from what it would be if people were left free to act on their own. If the State decides from whom to take and to whom to give, the power residing in the State’s hands is enormous. It is obvious that polit- ical unfortunates will be the ones whose property is confiscated, and political favorites the ones subsidized. And in the meantime the State erects a bureaucracy whose living is acquired by feed- ing off the confiscation of one group and the encouraged men- dicancy of another. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 273"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Other consequences follow from a regime of compulsory “charity.” For one thing, “the poor”—or the “deserving” poor—have been exalted as a privileged caste, with an enforce- able claim to the production of the more able. This is a far cry from a request for charity. Instead, the able are penalized and enslaved by the State, and the unable are placed on a moral pedestal. Certainly, this is a peculiar sort of moral program. The further consequence will be to discourage the able, to reduce production and saving in all of society, and beyond this, to sub- sidize the creation of a caste of poor. Not only will the poor be subsidized by right , but their ranks will be encouraged to mul- tiply, both through reproduction and through their moral exal- tation and subsidization. The able will be correspondingly ham- pered and repressed. 15 Whereas the opportunity for voluntary charity acts as a spur to production by the able, coerced charity acts as a drain and a burden upon production. In fact, in the long run, the greatest “charity” is precisely not what we know by that name, but rather simple, “selfish” capital investment and the search for techno- logical innovations. Poverty has been tamed by the enterprise and the capital investment of our ancestors, most of which was undoubtedly done for “selfish” motives. This is a fundamental illustration of the truth enunciated by Adam Smith that we gen- erally help others most in those very activities in which we help ourselves. Statists, in fact, are really opposed to charity. They often argue that charity is demeaning and degrading to the recipient, and that he should therefore be taught that the money is rightly his, to be given to him by the government as his due. But this oft-felt degradation stems, as Isabel Paterson pointed out, from the fact that the recipient of charity is not self-sup- porting on the market and that he is out of the production cir- cuit and no longer providing a service in exchange for one 274 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 15 See the readings referred to in footnote 3 of the preceding chapter."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"received. However, granting him the moral and legal right to mulct his fellows increases his moral degradation instead of end- ing it, for the beneficiary is now further removed from the pro- duction line than ever. An act of charity, when given voluntar- ily, is generally considered temporary and offered with the object of helping a man to help himself. But when the dole is ladled out by the State, it becomes permanent and perpetually degrading, keeping the recipients in a state of subservience. We are not attempting to argue at this point that to be subservient in this way is degrading; we simply say that anyone who con- siders private charity degrading must logically conclude that State charity is far more so. 16 Mises, furthermore, points out that free-market exchange—always condemned by statists for being impersonal and “unfeeling”—is precisely the relation that avoids all degradation and subservience. 17 9. The Charge of “Selfish Materialism” One of the most common charges levelled against the free market (even by many of its friends) is that it reflects and encourages unbridled “selfish materialism.” Even if the free Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 275 16 The devotion of government to charity may be gauged by its uni- versal repression of mendicancy . A direct gift to a beggar helps the recipient directly and leaves no opportunity for large bureaucratic organizations to live full-time off the transaction. Harassment of direct aid, then, func- tions as a grant of monopolistic privilege to the “official” charity organi- zations. Isabel Paterson points out that the American government imposed a requirement of minimum cash assets for immigrants as an alleged way of helping the poorer immigrants! The actual effect, of course, was to keep the poorest immigrants, who could not meet the require- ment, from American shores and economic opportunity. 17 On various aspects of the problem of charity and poverty, see Pater- son, “The Humanitarian with the Guillotine” in God of the Machine , pp. 233–50; Spencer, Social Statics , pp. 317–29; Mises, Human Action , pp. 831–36; F.A.

Read, “Unearned Riches,” ibid ., pp. 188–95."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"market—unhampered capitalism—best furthers man’s “mate- rial” ends, critics argue, it distracts man from higher ideals. It leads man away from spiritual or intellectual values and atro- phies any spirit of altruism. In the first place, there is no such thing as an “economic end.” Economy is simply a process of applying means to whatever ends a person may adopt. An individual can aim at any ends he pleases, “selfish” or “altruistic.” Other psychic factors being equal, it is to everyone’s self-interest to maximize his monetary income on the market. But this maximum income can then be used for “selfish” or for “altruistic” ends. Which ends people pursue is of no concern to the praxeologist. A successful busi- nessman can use his money to buy a yacht or to build a home for destitute orphans. The choice rests with him. But the point is that whichever goal he pursues, he must first earn the money before he can attain the goal. Secondly, whichever moral philosophy we adopt—whether altruism or egoism— we cannot criticize the pursuit of monetary income on the market. If we hold an egoistic social ethic, then obviously we can only applaud the maximization of monetary income, or of a mixture of monetary and other psychic income, on the market. There is no problem here. However, even if we adopt an altruistic ethic, we must applaud maximization of mon- etary income just as fervently. For market earnings are a social index of one’s services to others, at least in the sense that any services are exchangeable. The greater a man’s income, the greater has been his service to others. Indeed, it should be far easier for the altruist to applaud the maximization of a man’s monetary income than that of his psychic income when this is in conflict with the former goal. Thus, the consistent altruist must condemn the refusal of a man to work at a job paying high wages and his preference for a lower-paying job somewhere else. This man, whatever his reason, is defying the signalled wishes of the consumers, his fellows in society. If, then, a coal miner shifts to a more pleasant, but lower-pay- ing, job as a grocery clerk, the consistent altruist must castigate 276 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"him for depriving his fellowman of needed benefits. For the con- sistent altruist must face the fact that monetary income on the market reflects services to others, whereas psychic income is a purely personal, or “selfish,” gain. 18 This analysis applies directly to the pursuit of leisure . Leisure, as we have seen, is a basic consumers’ good for mankind. Yet the consistent altruist would have to deny each worker any leisure at all—or, at least, deny every hour of leisure beyond what is strictly necessary to maintain his output. For every hour spent in leisure reduces the time a man can spend serving his fellows. The consistent advocates of “consumers’ sovereignty” would have to favor enslaving the idler or the man who prefers fol- lowing his own pursuits to serving the consumer. Rather than scorn pursuit of monetary gain, the consistent altruist should praise the pursuit of money on the market and condemn any conflicting nonmonetary goals a producer may have—whether it be dislike for certain work, enthusiasm for work that pays less, or a desire for leisure. 19 Altruists who criticize monetary aims on the market, therefore, are wrong on their own terms. The charge of “materialism” is also fallacious. The market deals, not necessarily in “material” goods, but in exchangeable goods. It is true that all “material” goods are exchangeable (except for human beings themselves), but there are also many nonma- terial goods exchanged on the market. A man may spend his money on attending a concert or hiring a lawyer, for example, as well as on food or automobiles. There is absolutely no ground for saying that the market economy fosters either mate rial or Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 277 18 W.H. Hutt actually goes this far in his article, “The Concept of Consumers’ Sovereignty,” Economic Journal, March, 1940, pp. 66–77. 19 It is also peculiar that critics generally concentrate their fire on profits (“the profit motive”), and not on other market incomes such as wages. It is difficult to see any sense whatever in moral distinctions between these incomes."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"immaterial goods; it simply leaves every man free to choose his own pattern of spending. Finally, an advancing market economy satisfies more and more of people’s desires for exchangeable goods. As a result, the marginal utility of exchangeable goods tends to decline over time, while the marginal utility of nonexchangeable goods increases. In short, the greater satisfaction of “exchangeable” values confers a much greater marginal significance on the “nonexchangeable” values. Rather than foster “material” values, then, advancing capitalism does just the opposite. 10. Back to the Jungle? Many critics complain that the free market, in casting aside inefficient entrepreneurs or in other decisions, proves itself an “impersonal monster.” The free-market economy, they charge, is “the rule of the jungle,” where “survival of the fittest” is the law. 20 Libertarians who advocate a free market are therefore called “Social Darwinists” who wish to exterminate the weak for the benefit of the strong. In the first place, these critics overlook the fact that the oper- ation of the free market is vastly different from governmental action. When a government acts, individual critics are power- less to change the result. They can do so only if they can finally convince the rulers that their decision should be changed; this may take a long time or be totally impossible. On the free mar- ket, however, there is no final decision imposed by force; every- one is free to shape his own decisions and thereby significantly change the results of “the market.” In short, whoever feels that the market has been too cruel to certain entrepreneurs or to any other income receivers is perfectly free to set up an aid fund for 278 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 20 Some years ago we were promised a “refutation” of the libertarian position—one which never appeared.

Those who criticize existing private charity as being “insufficient” are perfectly free to fill the gap themselves. We must beware of hypostatizing the “market” as a real entity, a maker of inexorable decisions. The market is the resultant of the decisions of all individuals in the society; people can spend their money in any way they please and can make any decisions whatever concerning their persons and their property. They do not have to battle against or convince some entity known as the “market” before they can put their decisions into effect. The free market, in fact, is precisely the diametric opposite of the “jungle” society. The jungle is characterized by the war of all against all. One man gains only at the expense of another, by seizure of the latter’s property. With all on a subsistence level, there is a true struggle for survival, with the stronger force crushing the weaker. In the free market, on the other hand, one man gains only through serving another, though he may also retire into self-sufficient production at a primitive level if he so desires. It is precisely through the peaceful co-operation of the market that all men gain through the development of the divi- sion of labor and capital investment. To apply the principle of the “survival of the fittest” to both the jungle and the market is to ignore the basic question: Fitness for what ? The “fit” in the jungle are those most adept at the exercise of brute force. The “fit” on the market are those most adept in the service of soci- ety. The jungle is a brutish place where some seize from others and all live at the starvation level; the market is a peaceful and productive place where all serve themselves and others at the same time and live at infinitely higher levels of consumption. On the market, the charitable can provide aid, a luxury that can- not exist in the jungle. The free market, therefore, transmutes the jungle’s destruc- tive competition for meagre subsistence into a peaceful co-oper- ative competition in the service of one’s self and others. In the jungle, some gain only at the expense of others. On the market, Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 279"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"everyone gains. It is the market—the contractual society—that wrests order out of chaos, that subdues nature and eradicates the jungle, that permits the “weak” to live productively, or out of gifts from production, in a regal style compared to the life of the “strong” in the jungle. Furthermore, the market, by raising liv- ing standards, permits man the leisure to cultivate the very qual- ities of civilization that distinguish him from the brutes. It is precisely statism that is bringing back the rule of the jun- gle—bringing back conflict, disharmony, caste struggle, con- quest and the war of all against all, and general poverty. In place of the peaceful “struggle” of competition in mutual service, sta- tism substitutes calculational chaos and the death-struggle of Social Darwinist competition for political privilege and for lim- ited subsistence. 11. Power and Coercion A. “O THER F ORMS OF C OERCION ”: E CONOMIC P OWER A very common criticism of the libertarian position runs as follows: Of course we do not like violence, and libertarians per- form a useful service in stressing its dangers. But you are very simpliste because you ignore the other significant forms of coer- cion exercised in society— private coercive power, apart from the violence wielded by the State or the criminal. The govern- ment should stand ready to employ its coercion to check or off- set this private coercion. In the first place, this seeming difficulty for libertarian doc- trine may quickly be removed by limiting the concept of coer- cion to the use of violence . This narrowing would have the fur- ther merit of strictly confining the legalized violence of the police and the judiciary to the sphere of its competence: com- batting violence . But we can go even further, for we can show the inherent contradictions in the broader concept of coercion. A well-known type of “private coercion” is the vague but ominous-sounding “economic power.” A favorite illustration of the wielding of such “power” is the case of a worker fired from 280 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"his job, especially by a large corporation. Is this not “as bad as” violent coercion against the property of the worker? Is this not another, subtler form of robbery of the worker, since he is being deprived of money that he would have received if the employer had not wielded his “economic power”? Let us look at this situation closely. What exactly has the employer done? He has refused to continue to make a certain exchange, which the worker preferred to continue making. Specifically, A, the employer, refuses to sell a certain sum of money in exchange for the purchase of B’s labor services. B would like to make a certain exchange; A would not. The same principle may apply to all the exchanges throughout the length and breadth of the economy. A worker exchanges labor for money with an employer; a retailer exchanges eggs for money with a customer; a patient exchanges money with a doctor for his services; and so forth. Under a regime of freedom, where no violence is permitted, every man has the power either to make or not to make exchanges as and with whom he sees fit. Then, when exchanges are made, both parties benefit. We have seen that if an exchange is coerced , at least one party loses. It is doubt- ful whether even a robber gains in the long run, for a society in which violence and tyranny are practiced on a large scale will so lower productivity and become so much infected with fear and hate that even the robbers may be unhappy when they compare their lot with what it might be if they engaged in production and exchange in the free market. “Economic power,” then, is simply the right under freedom to refuse to make an exchange. Every man has this power. Every man has the same right to refuse to make a proffered exchange. Now, it should become evident that the “middle-of-the-road” statist, who concedes the evil of violence but adds that the vio- lence of government is sometimes necessary to counteract the “private coercion of economic power,” is caught in an impossi- ble contradiction. A refuses to make an exchange with B. What are we to say, or what is th e government to do, if B brandishes a Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 281"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"gun and orders A to make the exchange? This is the crucial question. There are only two positions we may take on the mat- ter: either that B is committing violence and should be stopped at once, or that B is perfectly justified in taking this step because he is simply “counteracting the subtle coercion” of economic power wielded by A. Either the defense agency must rush to the defense of A, or it deliberately refuses to do so, perhaps aiding B (or doing B’s work for him). There is no middle ground! B is committing violence; there is no question about that. In the terms of both doctrines, this violence is either invasive and therefore unjust, or defensive and therefore just. If we adopt the “economic-power” argument, we must choose the latter posi- tion; if we reject it, we must adopt the former. If we choose the “economic-power” concept, we must employ violence to com- bat any refusal of exchange; if we reject it, we employ violence to prevent any violent imposition of exchange. There is no way to escape this either-or choice. The “middle-of-the-road” statist cannot logically say that there are “many forms” of unjustified coercion. He must choose one or the other and take his stand accordingly. Either he must say that there is only one form of illegal coercion—overt physical violence—or he must say that there is only one form of illegal coercion—refusal to exchange. We have already fully described the sort of society built on libertarian foundations—a society marked by peace, harmony, liberty, maximum utility for all, and progressive improvement in living standards. What would be the consequence of adopting the “economic-power” premise? It would be a society of slavery: for what else is prohibiting the refusal to work? It would also be a society where the overt initiators of violence would be treated with kindness, while their victims would be upbraided as being “really” responsible for their own plight. Such a society would be truly a war of all against all, a world in which conquest and exploitation would rage unchecked. Let us analyze further the contrast between the power of vio- lence and “economic power,” between, in short, the victim of a bandit and the man who loses his job with the Ford Motor 282 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Company. Let us symbolize, in each case, the alleged power- wielder as P and the supposed victim as X. In the case of the bandit or robber, P plunders X. P lives, in short, by battening off X and all the other X’s. This is the meaning of power in its original, political sense. But what of “economic power”? Here, by contrast, X, the would-be employee, is asserting a strident claim to P ’s property! In this case, X is plundering P instead of the other way around. Those who lament the plight of the auto- mobile worker who cannot obtain a job with Ford do not seem to realize that before Ford and without Ford there would be no such job to be obtained at all. No one, therefore, can have any sort of “natural right” to a Ford job, whereas it is meaningful to assert a natural right to liberty, a right which each person may have without depending on the existence of others (such as Ford). In short, the libertarian doctrine, which proclaims a nat- ural right of defense against political power, is coherent and meaningful, but any proclaimed right of defense against “eco- nomic power” makes no sense at all. Here, indeed, are enor- mous differences between the two concepts of “power.” 21 B. P OWER O VER N ATURE AND P OWER O VER M AN It is quite common and even fashionable to discuss market phenomena in terms of “power”—that is, in terms appropriate only to the battlefield. We have seen the fallacy of the “back-to- the-jungle” criticism of the market and we have seen how the fal- lacious “economic-power” concept has been applied to the exchange economy. Political-power terminology, in fact, often dominates discussions of the market: peaceful businessmen are “economic royalists,” “economic feudalists,” or “robber barons.” Business is called a “system of power,” and firms are “private governments,” and, if they are very large, even “empires.” Less luridly, men have “bargaining power,” and business firms engage Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 283 21 On the spurious problems of “bargaining power,” see Scoville and Sar- gent, Fact and Fancy in the T.N.E.C. Monographs, pp. 312–13; and W.H. Hutt, Theory of Collective Bargaining (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1954), Part I."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"in “strategies” and “rivalry” as in military battles. Recently, the- ories of “games” and strategy have been erroneously applied to market activity, even to the absurd extent of comparing market exchange with a “zero-sum game”—an interrelation in which A’s loss is precisely equal to B’s gain. This, of course, is the action of coercive power, of conquest and robbery. There, one man’s gain is another man’s loss; one man’s victory, another’s defeat. Only conflict can describe these social relations. But the opposite is true on the free market, where everyone is a “victor” and everyone gains from social rela- tions. The language and concepts of political power are singu- larly inappropriate in the free-market society. The fundamental confusion here is the failure to distinguish between two very different concepts: power over nature and power over man. It is easy to see that an individual’s power is his ability to con- trol his environment in order to satisfy his wants. A man with an ax has the power to chop down a tree; a man with a factory has the power, along with other complementary factors, to pro- duce capital goods. A man with a gun has the power to force an unarmed man to do his bidding, provided that the unarmed man chooses not to resist or not to accept death at gunpoint. It should be clear that there is a basic distinction between the two types of power. Power over nature is the sort of power on which civilization must be built; the record of man’s history is the record of the advance or attempted advance of that power. Power over men, on the other hand, does not raise the general standard of living or promote the satisfactions of all, as does power over nature. By its very essence, only some men in soci- ety can wield power over men. Where power over man exists, some must be the powerful, and others must be objects of power. But every man can and does achieve power over nature. In fact, if we look at the basic condition of man as he enters the world, it is obvious that the only way to preserve his life and advance himself is to conquer nature—to transform the face of the earth to satisfy his wants. From the point of view of all the 284 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"members of the human race, it is obvious that only such a con- quest is productive and life-sustaining. Power of one man over another cannot contribute to the advance of mankind; it can only bring about a society in which plunder has replaced production, hegemony has supplanted contract, violence and conflict have taken the place of the peaceful order and harmony of the mar- ket. Power of one man over another is parasitic rather than cre- ative, for it means that the nature conquerors are subjected to the dictation of those who conquer their fellowman instead. Any society of force—whether ruled by criminal bands or by an organized State—fundamentally means the rule of the jungle, or economic chaos. Furthermore, it would be a jungle, a struggle in the sense of the Social Darwinists, in which the survivors would not really be the “fittest,” for the “fitness” of the victors would consist solely in their ability to prey on producers. They would not be the ones best fitted for advancing the human species: these are the producers, the conquerors of nature . The libertarian doctrine, then, advocates the maximization of man’s power over nature and the eradication of the power of man over man. Statists, in elevating the latter power, often fail to realize that in their system man’s power over nature would wither and become negligible. Albert Jay Nock was aiming at this dichotomy when, in Our Enemy the State, he distinguished between social power and State power . 22 Those who properly balk at any terms that seem to anthropomorphize “society” were wary of accepting this termi- nology. But actually this distinction is a very important one. Nock’s “social power” is society’s—mankind’s—conquest of nature: the power that has helped to produce the abundance that man has been able to wrest from the earth. His “State power” is political power —the use of the political means as against the “economic means” to wealth. State power is the power of man over man—the wielding of coercive violence by one group over another. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 285 22 Nock, Our Enemy the State ."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Nock used these categories to analyze historical events in brilliant fashion. He saw the history of mankind as a race between social power and State power. Always man—led by the producers—has tried to advance the conquest of his natural environment. And always men—other men—have tried to extend political power in order to seize the fruits of this conquest over nature. History can then be interpreted as a race between social power and State power. In the more abundant periods, e.g., after the Industrial Revolution, social power takes a large spurt ahead of political power, which has not yet had a chance to catch up. The stagnant periods are those in which State power has at last come to extend its control over the newer areas of social power. State power and social power are antithetical, and the former subsists by draining the latter. Clearly, the concepts advanced here—“power over nature” and “power over man”— are generalizations and clarifications of Nock’s categories. One problem may appear puzzling: What is the nature of “purchasing power” on the market? Is this not power over man and yet “social” and on the free market? However, this contra- diction is only apparent. Money has “purchasing power” only because other men are willing to accept it in exchange for goods, i.e., because they are eager to exchange. The power to exchange rests—on both sides of the exchange—on production , and this is precisely the conquest of nature that we have been discussing. In fact, it is the exchange process—the division of labor—that per- mits man’s power over nature to extend beyond the primitive level. It was power over nature that the Ford Motor Company had developed in such abundance, and it was this power that the angry job seeker was threatening to seize—by political power— while complaining about Ford’s “economic power.” In sum, political-power terminology should be applied only to those employing violence. The only “private governments” are those people and organizations aggressing against persons and property that are not part of the official State dominating certain territory. These “private States,” or private governments, 286 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"may either co-operate with the official State, as did the govern- ments of the guilds in the Middle Ages, and as labor unions and cartelists do today, or they may compete with the official State and be designated as “criminals” or “bandits.” 12. The Problem of Luck A common criticism of free-market decisions is that “luck” plays too great a role in determining incomes. Even those who concede that income to a factor tends to equal its discounted marginal value product to consumers, and that entrepreneurs on the free market will reduce mistakes to an absolute mini- mum, add that luck still plays a role in income determination. After charging that the market confers undue laurels on the lucky, the critic goes on to call for expropriation of the “rich” (or lucky) and subsidization of the “poor” (or unlucky). Yet how can luck be isolated and identified? It should be evi- dent that it is impossible to do so. In every market action luck is interwoven inextricably and is impossible to isolate. Conse- quently, there is no justification for saying that the rich are luckier than the poor. It might very well be that many or most of the rich have been unlucky and are getting less than their true DMVP, while most of the poor have been lucky and are getting more. No one can say what the distribution of luck is; hence, there is no justification here for a “redistribution” policy. In only one place on the market does luck purely and identi- fiably determine the result: gambling gains and losses. 23 But is this what the statist critics really want—confiscation of the gains of gambling winners in order to pay gambling losers? This would mean, of course, the speedy death of gambling—except as an illegal activity—for there would obviously be no point in continuing the games. Presumably, even the losers would object to being compensated, for they freely and voluntarily accepted Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 287 23 Here we refer to pure gambling, or games of chance, such as roulette, with no intermingled elements of skill such as in race-track betting."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"the rules of chance before beginning to gamble. The govern- mental policy of neutralizing luck destroys the satisfaction that all the participants derive from the game. 24 13. The Traffic-Manager Analogy Because of its popularity, we may briefly consider the “traf- fic-manager analogy”—the doctrine that the government must obviously regulate the economy, “just as traffic must be regu- lated.” It is high time that this flagrant non sequitur be consigned to oblivion. Every owner necessarily regulates his own property. In the same way, every owner of a road will lay down the rules for the use of his road. Far from being an argument for statism, management is simply the attribute of all ownership. Those who own the roads will regulate their use. In the present day, the government owns most roads and so regulates them. In a purely free-market society, private owners would operate and control their own roads. Obviously, the “traffic-manager anal- ogy” can furnish no argument against the purely free market. 14. Over- and Underdevelopment Critics often level conflicting charges against the free mar- ket. The historicist-minded may concede that the free market is ideal for a certain stage of economic development, but insist that it is unsuited to other stages. Thus, advanced nations have been exhorted to embrace government planning because “the modern economy is too complex” to remain planless, “the fron- tier is gone,” and “the economy is now mature.” But, on the other hand, the backward countries have been told that they must adopt statist planning methods because of their relatively primitive state. So any given economy is either too advanced or 288 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 24 It is curious that so many economists, including Alfred Marshall, have “proved” the “irrationality” of gambling (e.g., from the diminishing marginal utility of money) by first assuming, clearly erroneously, that the participants do not like to gamble!"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"too backward for laissez faire ; and we may rest assured that the appointed moment for laissez faire somehow never arrives. The currently fashionable “economics of growth” is an his- toricist regression. The laws of economics apply whatever the particular level of the economy. At any level, progressive change consists in a growing volume of capital per head of population and is furthered by the free market, low time preferences, far- seeing entrepreneurs, and sufficient labor and natural resources. Regressive change is brought about by the opposite conditions. The terms progressive and regressive change are far better than “growth,” a term expressing a misleading biological analogy that implies some actual law dictating that an economy must “grow” continually, and even at a fixed rate. Actually, of course, an economy can just as easily “grow” backward. The term “underdeveloped” is also unfortunate, as it implies that there is some level or norm that the economy should have reached but failed to reach because some external force did not “develop” it. The old-fashioned term “backward,” though still normative, at least pins the blame for the relative poverty of an economy on the nation’s own policies. The poor country can best progress by permitting private enterprise and investment to function and by allowing natives and foreigners to invest there unhampered and unmolested. As for the rich country and its “complexities,” the delicate processes of the free market are precisely equipped to handle complex adjustments and interrelations far more efficiently than can any form of statist planning. 15. The State and the Nature of Man Since the problem of the nature of man has been raised, we may now turn briefly to an argument that has pervaded Roman Catholic social philosophy, namely, that the State is part of the essential nature of man. This Thomistic view stems from Aris- totle and Plato, who, in their quest for a rational ethic, leaped to the assumption that the State was the embodiment of the Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 289"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"moral agency for mankind. That man should do such and such quickly became translated into the prescription: The State should do such and such. But nowhere is the nature of the State itself fundamentally examined. Typical is a work very influential in Catholic circles, Hein- rich Rommen’s The State in Catholic Thought . 25 Following Aris- totle, Rommen attempts to ground the State in the nature of man by pointing out that man is a social being. In proving that man’s nature is best fitted for a society, he believes that he has gone far to provide a rationale for the State. But he has not done so in the slightest degree, once we fully realize that the State and society are by no means coextensive. The contention of lib- ertarians that the State is an antisocial instrument must first be refuted before such a non sequitur can be allowed. Rommen rec- ognizes that the State and society are distinct, but he still justi- fies the State by arguments that apply only to society. He also asserts the importance of law, although the particu- lar legal norms considered necessary are unfortunately not specified. Yet law and the State are not coextensive either, although this is a fallacy that very few writers avoid. Much Anglo-Saxon law grew out of the voluntarily adopted norms of the people themselves (common law, law merchant, etc.), not as State legislation. 26 Rommen also stresses the importance for society of the predictability of action, which can be assured only by the State. Yet the essence of human nature is that it cannot be considered as truly predictable; otherwise we should be deal- ing, not with free men, but with an ant heap. And if we could force men to march in unison according to a complete set of predictable norms, it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that we should all hail such an ideal. Some people would combat it bitterly. Finally, if the “enforceable norm” were limited to “abstinence from aggression against others,” (1) a State is not 290 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 25 Heinrich Rommen, The State in Catholic Thought, a Treatise in Polit- ical Philosophy (London, 1950). 26 Thus, see Leoni, Freedom and the Law ."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"necessary for such enforcement, as we have noted above, and (2) the State’s own inherent aggression itself violates that norm. 27 16. Human Rights and Property Rights 28 It is often asserted by critics of the free-market economy that they are interested in preserving “human rights” rather than property rights. This artificial dichotomy between human and property rights has often been refuted by libertarians, who have pointed out ( a ) that property rights of course accrue to humans and to humans alone, and ( b ) that the “human right” to life requires the right to keep what one has produced to sustain and advance life. In short, they have shown that property rights are indissolubly also human rights. They have, besides, pointed out that the “human right” of a free press would be only a mockery in a socialist country, where the State owns and decides upon the allocation of newsprint and other newspaper capital. 29 There are other points that should be made, however. For not only are property rights also human rights, but in the most profound sense there are no rights but property rights. The only human rights, in short, are property rights. There are several senses in which this is true. In the first place, each individual, as a natural fact, is the owner of himself , the ruler of his own per- son. The “human” rights of the person that are defended in the purely free-market society are, in effect, each man’s property right in his own being, and from this property right stems his right to the material goods that he has produced.

Take, for example, the “human right” of free speech. Freedom of speech is supposed to mean the right of everyone to say whatever he likes. But the neglected question is: Where? Where does a man have this right? He certainly does not have it on property on which he is trespassing. In short, he has this right only either on his own property or on the property of someone who has agreed, as a gift or in a rental contract, to allow him on the premises. In fact, then, there is no such thing as a separate “right to free speech”; there is only a man’s prop- erty right: the right to do as he wills with his own or to make voluntary agreements with other property owners. The concentration on vague and wholly “human” rights has not only obscured this fact but has led to the belief that there are, of necessity, all sorts of conflicts between individual rights and alleged “public policy” or the “public good.” These con- flicts have, in turn, led people to contend that no rights can be absolute, that they must all be relative and tentative. Take, for example, the human right of “freedom of assembly.” Suppose that a citizens’ group wishes to demonstrate for a certain meas- ure. It uses a street for this purpose. The police, on the other hand, break up the meeting on the ground that it obstructs traf- fic. Now, the point is that there is no way of resolving this con- flict, except arbitrarily, because the government owns the streets. Government ownership, as we have seen, inevitably breeds insoluble conflicts. For, on the one hand, the citizens’ group can argue that they are taxpayers and are therefore entitled to use the streets for assembly, while, on the other hand, the police are right that traffic is obstructed. There is no rational way to resolve the conflict because there is as yet no true ownership of the valuable street-resource. In a purely free society, where the streets are privately owned, the question would be simple: it would be for the streetowner to decide, and it would be the con- cern of the citizens’ group to try to rent the street space volun- tarily from the owner. If all ownership were private, it would be 292 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"quite clear that the citizens did not have any nebulous “right of assembly.” Their right would be the property right of using their money in an effort to buy or rent space on which to make their demonstration, and they could do so only if the owner of the street agreed to the deal. Let us consider, finally, the classic case that is supposed to demonstrate that individual rights can never be absolute but must be limited by “public policy”: Justice Holmes’ famous dic- tum that no man can have the right to cry “fire” in a crowded theater. This is supposed to show that freedom of speech can- not be absolute. But if we cease dealing with this alleged human right and seek for the property rights involved, the solution becomes clear, and we see that there is no need at all to weaken the absolute nature of rights. For the person who falsely cries “fire” must be either the owner (or the owner’s agent) or a guest or paying patron. If he is the owner, then he has committed fraud upon his customers. He has taken their money in exchange for a promise to put on a motion picture, and now, instead, he disrupts the performance by falsely shouting “fire” and creating a disturbance among the patrons. He has thus will- fully defaulted on his contractual obligation and has therefore violated the property rights of his patrons. Suppose, on the other hand, that the shouter is not the owner, but a patron. In that case, he is obviously violating the property right of the theater owner (as well as the other patrons). As a guest, he is on the property on certain terms, and he has the obli- gation of not violating the owner’s property rights by disrupting the performance that the owner is putting on for the patrons. The person who maliciously cries “fire” in a crowded theater, therefore, is a criminal, not because his so-called “right of free speech” must be pragmatically restricted on behalf of the so- called “public good,” but because he has clearly and obviously violated the property rights of another human being. There is no need, therefore, of placing limits upon these rights.

A PPENDIX P ROFESSOR O LIVER ON S OCIOECONOMIC G OALS Some years ago, Professor Henry M. Oliver published an important study: a logical analysis of ethical goals in economic affairs. 30 Professor Kenneth J. Arrow has hailed the work as a pioneer achievement on the road to the “axiomatization of a social ethics.” Unfortunately, this attempted “axiomatization” is a tissue of logical fallacies. 31 It is remarkable what difficulty economists and political philosophers have had in trying to bury laissez faire . For well over a half century, laissez-faire thought, both in its Natural-Rights and its utilitarian versions, has been extremely rare in the West- ern world. And yet, despite the continued proclamation that lais- sez faire has been completely “discredited,” uneasiness has marked the one-sided debate. And so, from time to time, writers have felt obliged to lay the ghost of laissez faire. The absence of opposition has created a series of faintly worried monologues 294 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 30 Henry M.

Nevertheless the attacks continue, and now Professor Oliver has gone to the extent of writing a book almost wholly devoted to an attempted refutation of laissez-faire thought. A. T HE A TTACK ON N ATURAL L IBERTY Oliver begins by turning his guns on the natural-rights defense of laissez faire —on the system of natural liberty. 32 He is worried because Americans still seem to cling to this doctrine in underlying theory, if not in actual practice. First, he sets forth various versions of the libertarian position, including the “extreme” version, “A man has a right to do what he will with his own,” as well as Spencer’s Law of Equal Freedom and the “semi- utilitarian” position that “a man is free to do as he pleases as long as he does not harm someone.” The “semiutilitarian” position is easiest to attack, and Oliver has no difficulty in showing its vagueness. “Harm” can be interpreted to cover practically all actions, e.g., a hater of the color red can argue that someone else inflicts “aesthetic harm” upon him by wearing a red coat. Characteristically, Oliver has least patience with the “extreme” version, which, he contends, is “not meant to be interpreted literally,” not a seriously reasoned statement, etc. This enables him to shift quickly to attacks on the modified and weaker versions of libertarianism. Yet it is a serious statement and must be coped with seriously, especially if “A” is replaced by “Every” in the sentence. Too often political debate has been short-circuited by someone’s blithe comment that “you can’t really be serious!” We have seen above that Spencer’s Law of Equal Freedom is really a redundant version of the “extreme” statement and that the first part implies the proviso clause. The “extreme” statement permits a more clear-cut presentation, avoiding many of the interpretative pitfalls of the watered-down version. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 295 32 Oliver, Critique of Socioeconomic Goals , pp. 1–12."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Let us now turn to Oliver’s general criticisms of the liber- tarian position. Conceding that it has “great superficial attrac- tive ness,” Oliver levels a series of criticisms that are supposed to demonstrate its illogic: (1) Any demarcation of property “restricts liberty,” i.e., the liberty of others to use these resources. This criticism misuses the term “liberty.” Obviously, any property right infringes on others’ “freedom to steal.” But we do not even need property rights to establish this “limitation”; the existence of another per- son , under a regime of liberty, restricts the “liberty” of others to assault him. Yet, by definition, liberty cannot be restricted thereby, because liberty is defined as freedom to control what one owns without molestation by others. “Freedom to steal or assault” would permit someone—the victim of stealth or assault—to be forcibly or fraudulently deprived of his person or property and would therefore violate the clause of total liberty: that every man be free to do what he wills with his own. Doing what one wills with someone else’s own impairs the other person’s liberty. (2) A more important criticism in Oliver’s eyes is that natural rights connote a concept of property as consisting in “things” and that such a concept eliminates property in intangible “rights.” Oliver holds that if property is defined as a bundle of things, then all property in rights, such as stocks and bonds, would have to be eliminated; whereas if property is defined as “rights,” insoluble problems arise of defining rights apart from current legal custom. Furthermore, property in “rights” divorced from “things” allows non-laissez-faire rights to crop up, such as “rights in jobs,” etc. This is Oliver’s primary criticism. This point is a completely fallacious one. Although property is certainly a bundle of physical things, there is no dichotomy between things and rights; in fact, “rights” are simply rights to things. A share in an oil company is not an intangible floating “right”; it is a certificate of aliquot ownership in the physical property of the oil company. Similarly, a bond is directly a claim to ownership of a certain amount of money and, in the final analysis, is an aliquot ownership in the company’s physical 296 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"property. “Rights” (except for grants of monopolistic privilege, which would be eliminated in the free society) are simply divis- ible reflections of physical property. (3) Oliver tries to demonstrate that the libertarian position, however phrased, does not necessarily lead to laissez faire. As we have indicated, he does this by skipping quickly over the “extreme” position and concentrating his attack on the unques- tionable weaknesses of some of the more qualified formulations. The “harm” clause of the semiutilitarians is justly criticized. Spencer’s Law of Equal Freedom is attacked for its proviso clause and for the alleged vagueness of the phrase “infringes on the equal freedom of others.” Actually, as we have seen, this pro- viso is unnecessary and could well be eliminated. Even so, Oliver does considerably less than justice to the Spencerian position. He sets up alternative straw-man definitions of “infringement” and shows that none of these alternatives leads to strict laissez faire. A more thorough search would easily have yielded Oliver the proper definition. Of the five alternative definitions he offers, the first simply defines infringement as “violation of the customary legal code”—a question-begging definition that no rational libertarian would employ. Basing his argument neces- sarily on principle, the libertarian must fashion his standard by means of reason and cannot simply adopt existing legal custom. Oliver’s fourth and fifth definitions—“exercise of control in any form over another person’s satisfaction or deeds”—are so vague and so question-begging in the use of the word “control” that no libertarian would ever use them. This leaves the second and third definitions of “infringement,” in which Oliver man- ages to skirt any reasonable solution to the problem. The for- mer defines “infringement” as “direct physical interference with another man’s control of his person and owned things”; and the latter, as “direct physical interference plus interference in the form of threat of injury.” But the former apparently excludes fraud, while the latter not only excludes fraud, but also includes threats to compete with someone else, etc. Since Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 297"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"neither defini tion implies a laissez-faire system, Oliver quickly gives up the task and concludes that the term “infringement” is hopelessly vague and cannot be used to deduce the laissez-faire concept of freedom, and therefore that laissez faire needs a spe- cial, additional ethical assumption aside from the basic libertar- ian postulate. Yet a proper definition of “infringement” can be found in order to arrive at a laissez-faire conclusion. The vague, question- begging term “injury” must not be used. Instead, infringement can be defined as “direct physical interference with another man’s person or property, or the threat of such physical inter- ference.” Contrary to Oliver’s assumption, fraud is included in the category of “direct physical interference,” for such interfer- ence means not only the direct use of armed violence, but also such acts as trespass and burglary without use of a weapon. In both cases, “violence” has been done to someone else’s property by physically molesting it. Fraud is implicit theft, because fraud entails the physical appropriation of someone else’s property under false pretenses, i.e., in exchange for something that is never delivered. In both cases, someone’s property is taken from him without his consent. Where there’s a will there’s a way, and thus we see that it is quite easy to define the Spencerian formula clearly enough so that laissez faire and only laissez faire follows from it. The impor- tant point to remember is never to use such vague expressions as “injury,” “harm,” or “control,” but specific terms, such as “physical interference” or “threats of physical violence.” B. T HE A TTACK ON F REEDOM OF C ONTRACT After disposing to his own satisfaction of the basic natural- rights postulates, Oliver goes on to attack a specific class of these rights: freedom of contract. 33 Oliver delineates three possible freedom-of-contract clauses: (1) “A man has a right to freedom 298 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 33 Oliver, Critique of Socioeconomic Goals , pp. 12–19."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"of contract”; (2) “A man has a right to freedom of contract unless the terms of the contract harm someone”; and (3) “A man has a right to freedom of contract unless the terms of the con- tract infringe upon someone’s rights.” The second clause can be disposed of immediately; once again, the vague notion of “harm” can provide an excuse for unlimited State intervention, as Oliver quickly notes. No libertarian would adopt such a phrasing. The first formulation is, of course, the most uncom- promising and leaves no room whatever for State intervention. Here Oliver again scoffs and says that “very few persons would push the freedom-of-contract doctrine so far.” Perhaps, but since when is truth established by majority vote? In fact, the third clause, with its Spencerian proviso, is again unnecessary. Suppose, for example, that A and B freely contract to shoot C. The third version may say that this is an illegal contract. But, actually, it should not be! For the contract itself does not and cannot violate C’s rights. It is only a possible subsequent action against C that will violate his rights. But, in that case, it is that action which must be declared illegal and punished, not the pre- ceding contract. The first clause, which provides for absolute freedom of contract, is the clearest and evidently the preferable formulation. 34 Oliver sees the principle of freedom of contract, because of the necessity that there be mutual agreement between two people, open to even stronger objection than the basic natural- rights postulate. For how, asks Oliver, can we distinguish between a free and voluntary contract, on the one hand, and “fraud” and “coercion”—which void contracts—on the other? Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 299 34 In objection to this clause, Oliver states that “Anglo-American law traditionally has voided certain types of contract because of the belief that they are against the public interest.” Ibid ., p. 13. It is precisely for this rea- son that libertarians suggest changing traditional Anglo-American law to conform to their precepts. Furthermore, “public interest” is a meaning- less term (an example of the fallacy of conceptual realism) and is there- fore discarded by libertarians."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"First, how can fraud be clearly defined? Oliver’s critique here is in two parts: (1) He says that “common law holds that certain types of omissions as well as certain types of false statements and mis- leading sections void contracts. Where is this rule of omission to stop?” Oliver sees, quite correctly, that if no omission at all were allowed, the degree of statism would be enormous. Yet this problem is solved very simply: change the common law so as to eliminate all rules of omission whatever! It is curious that Oliver is so reluctant even to consider changes in ancient legal customs where these changes seem called for by principle, or to realize that libertarians would advocate such changes. Since libertari- ans advocate sweeping changes elsewhere in the political struc- ture, there is no reason why they should balk at changing a few clauses of the common law. (2) He states that even rules against false statements seem statist to some people and could be pushed beyond their pres- ent limits, and he cites SEC regulations as an example. Yet the whole problem is that a libertarian system could countenance no administrative boards or regulations whatever. No advance regulations could be handed down. On the purely free market, anyone damaged by false statements would take his opponent to court and win redress there. But any false statements, any fraud, would then be punished by the court severely, in the same man- ner as theft. Secondly, Oliver wants to know how “coercion” can be defined. Here, the reader is referred to the section on “Other Forms of Coercion” above. Oliver is confused in contradictorily jumbling the definitions of coercion as physical violence and as refusal to exchange. As we have seen, coercion can rationally be defined only as one or the other; not as both, for then the defi- nition is self-contradictory. Further, he confuses physical inter- personal violence with the scarcity imposed by the facts of nature—lumping them both together as “coercion.” He con- cludes in the hopelessly muddled assertion that the freedom-of- contract theory assumes a meaningless “equality of coercion” 300 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"among contracting parties. In fact, libertarians assert that there is no coercion at all in the free market. The equality-of-coer- cion absurdity permits Oliver to state that true freedom of con- tract at least requires State-enforced “pure competition.” The freedom-of-contract argument, therefore, implies lais- sez faire and is also strictly derivable from the postulate of free- dom. Contrary to Oliver, no other ethical postulates are neces- sary to imply laissez faire from this argument. The coercion problem is completely solved when “violence” is substituted for the rather misleading term “coercion.” Then, any contract is free and therefore valid when there has been an absence of vio- lence or threat of violence by either party. Oliver makes a few other attacks on “legal liberty”; e.g., he raises the old slogan that “legal liberty does not correspond to ‘actual’ liberty (or effective opportunity)”—once again falling into the age-old confusion of freedom with power or abun- dance. In one of his most provocative statements, he asserts that “all men could enjoy complete legal liberty only under a system of anarchy” (p. 21). It is rare for someone to identify a system under law as being “anarchy.” If this be anarchism, then many libertarians will embrace the term! C. T HE A TTACK ON I NCOME A CCORDING TO E ARNINGS On the free market every man obtains money income inso- far as he can sell his goods or services for money. Everyone’s income will vary in accordance with freely chosen market valu- ations of his productivity in fulfilling consumer desires. In his comprehensive attack on laissez faire , Professor Oliver, in addi- tion to criticizing the doctrines of natural liberty and freedom of contract, also condemns this principle, or what he calls the “earned-income doctrine.” 35 Oliver contends that since workers must use capital and land, the right to property cannot rest on what human labor Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 301 35 Oliver, Critique of Socioeconomic Goals , pp. 26–57."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"creates. But both capital goods and land are ultimately reducible to labor (and time): capital goods were all built by the original factors, land and labor; and land had to be found by human labor and brought into production by labor. Therefore, not only current labor, but also “stored-up” labor (or rather, stored-up labor-and-time), earn money in current production, and so there is as much reason why the owners of these resources should obtain money now as there is that current laborers earn money now. The right of past labor to earn is established by the right of bequest, which stems immediately from the right of property. The right of inheritance rests not so much on the right of later generations to receive as on the right of earlier generations to bestow . With these general considerations in mind, we may turn to some of Oliver’s detailed criticisms. First, he states the basic “earned-income” principle incorrectly, and this is a standing source of confusion. He phrases it thus: “A man acquires a right to income which he himself creates.” Incorrect. He acquires the right, not to “income,” but to the property that he himself cre- ates. The importance of this distinction will become clear presently. A man has the right to his own product , to the prod- uct of his energy, which immediately becomes his property. He derives his money income by exchanging this property, this product of his or his ancestors’ energy, for money. His goods or services are freely exchanged on the market for money. His income is therefore completely determined by the monetary valuation that the market places on his goods or services. Much of Oliver’s subsequent criticism stems from ignoring the fact that all complementary resources are founded on the labor of individuals. He also decries the idea that “if a man makes something, it is his” as “very simple.” Simple it may be, but that should not be a pejorative term in science. On the con- trary, the principle of Occam’s Razor tells us that the simpler a truth is, the better. The criterion of a statement, therefore, is its truth , and simplicity is, ceteris paribus , a virtue. The point is that when a man makes something, it belongs either to him or to 302 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"someone else. To whom, then, shall it belong: to the producer, or to someone who has stolen it from the producer? Perhaps this is a simple choice, but a necessary one nevertheless. Yet how can we tell when a person has “made” something or not? Oliver worries considerably about this question and criti- cizes the marginal productivity theory at length. Aside from the fallacies of his objections, the marginal productivity theory is not at all necessary (although it is helpful) to this ethical discus- sion. For the criterion to be used in determining who has made the product on the market and who should therefore earn the money, is really very simple. The criterion is: Who owns the prod- uct? A spends his labor energy working in a factory; this contri- bution of labor energy to further production is bought and paid for by factory owner, B. A owns labor energy, which is hired by B. In this case, the product made by A is his energy , and its use is paid for, or hired, by B. B hires various factors to work on his capital, and the capital is finally transformed into another prod- uct and sold to C. The product belongs to B, and B exchanges it for money. The money that B obtains, over and above the amount that he had to pay for other factors of production, rep- resents B’s contribution to the product. The amount that his capital received goes to B, its owner, etc. Oliver also believes it a criticism when he states that men do not really “make goods” but add value to them by applying labor. But no one denies this. Man does not create matter, just as he does not create land. Rather, he takes this natural matter and transforms it in a series of processes to arrive at more use- ful goods. He hopes to add value by transforming matter. To say this is to strengthen rather than weaken the earnings theory, since it should be clear that how much value is added in producing goods for exchange can be determined only by the purchases of customers, ultimately the consumers. Oliver betrays his confu- sion by asserting that the earning theory assumes that “the val- ues which we receive in exchange are equal in worth to those which we create in the production process.” Certainly not! There are no actual values created in the production process; Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 303"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"these “values” take on meaning only from the values we receive in exchange. We cannot “compare received and created values” because created property becomes valuable only to the extent that it is purchased in exchange. Here we see some of the fruits of Oliver’s fundamental confusion between “creating income” and “creating a product.” People do not create income; they create a product , which they hope can be exchanged for income by being useful to consumers. Oliver compounds his confusion by next taking up the lais- sez-faire theorem that everyone has the right to his own value scale and to act on that value scale. Instead of stating this prin- ciple in these terms, Oliver introduces confusion by calling it “placing values on an equal footing” for each man. Conse- quently, he can then criticize this approach by asking how peo- ple’s values can have an “equal footing” when one person’s pur- chasing power is more than another’s, etc. The reader will have no difficulty in seeing the confusion here between equality of liberty and equality of abundance. Another of Oliver’s critical objections to the earned-income theory is that it assumes that “all values are gained through pur- chase and sale, that all goods are those of the market place.” This is nonsense, and no responsible economist ever assumed it. In fact, no one denies that there are nonmarketable, nonex- changeable goods (such as friendship, love, and religion) and that many men value these goods very highly. They must con- stantly choose how to allocate their resources between exchangeable and nonexchangeable goods. This causes not the slightest difficulty for the free market or for the “earned- income” doctrine. In fact, a man earns money in exchange for his exchangeable goods. What could be more reasonable? A man acquires his income by selling exchangeable goods at market; so naturally the money he acquires will be determined by the buy- ers’ evaluations of these goods. How, indeed, can he ever acquire exchangeable goods in return for his pursuit (or offer?) of nonexchangeables? And why should he? Why and how will others be forced to pay money for nothing in return? And how 304 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"will the government determine who has produced what nonex- changeable goods and what the reward or penalty shall be? When Oliver states that market earnings are unsatisfactory because they do not cover nonmarket production as well, he fails to indicate why nonmarketable goods should enter the pic- ture at all. Why should not marketable goods pay for marketable goods? Oliver’s statement that “nonmarket receipts” are hardly distributed so as to “solve the nonmarket part of the problem” makes little sense. What in the world are “nonmarket receipts”? And if they are not inner satisfaction from inner pursuits by the individual, what in the world are they? If Oliver suggests taking money from A to pay B, then he is suggesting the seizure of a marketable good, and the receipts are then quite marketable. But if he is not suggesting this, then his remarks are quite irrelevant, and he can say nothing against the earned-income principle. Also, it should not be overlooked that all those on the mar- ket who wish to reward nonmarketable contributions with money are free to do so. In fact, in the free society such rewards will be effected to the maximum degree freely desired in it. We have seen that the marginal productivity theory is not necessary to an ethical solution. A man’s property is his product, and this will be sold at its estimated worth to consumers on the market. The market solves the problem of estimating worth, and better than any coercive agency or economist could. If Oliver disagrees with market verdicts on the marginal value productivity of any factor, he is hereby invited to become an entrepreneur and to earn the profits that come from exposing such maladjustments. Oliver’s problems are pseudo-problems. Thus, he asks, “When White’s cotton is exchanged for Brown’s wheat, what is the ethically correct ratio of exchange?” Simple, answers the free-market doctrine: Whatever the two freely decide. “When Jones and Smith together produce a good, what part of that good is attributable to Jones’ actions and what part to Smith’s?” The answer: Whatever they have mutually con- tracted. Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 305"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Oliver gives several fallacious reasons for rejecting the mar- ginal productivity theory. One is that income imputation does not imply income creation, because a laborer’s marginal product can be altered merely by a change in the quantity or quality of a complementary factor, or by a variation in the number of com- peting laborers. Once again, Oliver’s confusion stems from talk- ing about “income creation” instead of “product creation.” The laborer creates his labor service. This is his property, his to sell at whatever market he wishes, or not to sell if he so desires. The appraised worth of this service depends on his marginal value product, which, of course, depends partly on competition and the number or quality of complementary factors. This, in fact, does not confound, but rather is an integral part of, marginal productivity theory. If the supply of co-operating capital increases, a laborer’s energy service becomes scarcer in relation to the complementary factors (land, capital), and his marginal value product and income increase. Similarly, if there are more competing laborers, there may be a tendency for a laborer’s DMVP to decline, although it may increase because of the wider extent of the market. It is beside the point to say that all this is “not fair” because his service output remains the same. The point is that to the consumers his worth in production varies in accordance with these other factors, and he is paid accordingly. Oliver also employs the popular but completely fallacious doctrine that any ethical sense to the marginal productivity the- ory must rely on the existence of “pure competition.” But why should the “marginal value product” of a freely competitive economy be any less ethical than the “value of the marginal product” of the Never-Never Land of pure competition? Oliver adopts Joan Robinson’s doctrine that entrepreneurs “exploit” the factors and reap a special exploitation gain. But on the con- trary, as Professor Chamberlin has conceded, no one reaps any “exploitation” in the world of free competition. 36 306 Power and Market: Government and the Economy 36 Edward H. Chamberlin, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition, 7th ed. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956), pp. 182 ff. “Pure”"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Oliver makes several other interesting criticisms: (1) He maintains that marginal productivity cannot apply within corporations because no market for a firm’s capital exists after the initial establishment of the company. Hence, the direc- tors can rule the stockholders. In rebuttal, we may ask how the directors can remain directors without representing the wishes of the majority of stockholders. The capital market is continu- ing because capital values are constantly shifting on the stock market. A sharp decline in stock values means grave losses for the owners of the company. Furthermore, it means that there will be no further capital expansion in that firm and that its cap- ital may not even be maintained intact. (2) He maintains that the marginal productivity theory can- not account for the “lumpy,” “fixed” contribution to all incomes of the services supplied by the State. In the first place, marginal productivity theory does not at all, in its proper form, assume (as Oliver believes) that factors are infinitely divisible. Any “lumps” can be taken care of. The problem of the State, there- fore, has really nothing to do with lumpy factors. Indeed, all factors are more or less “lumpy.” Furthermore, Oliver concedes that the services of the State are divisible. In one of his rare flashes of insight, Oliver admits that there can be (and are!) “varying degr ees of police, military, and monetary (e.g., mint) services.” But if that is the case, how do State services differ from any other? The difference is indeed great, but it stems from a fact we have reiterated many times: that the State is a compulsory monopoly in which payment is separated from receipt of serv- ice. As long as this condition exists, there can indeed be no mar- ket “measure” of its marginal productivity. But how can this be an argument against the free market? Indeed, it is precisely the Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 307 competition is an unrealistic—and undesirable—model admired by many economists, in which all firms are so tiny that no one has any impact on its market. See , Man, Economy, and State , chapter 10."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"free market that would correct this condition. Oliver’s criticism here is not of the free market, but of the statist sphere of a mixed statist-market economy. Oliver’s attribution of income creation to “organized society” is very vague. If by this he means “society,” he is using a mean- ingless phrase. It is precisely the process of the market by which the array of free individuals (constituting “society”) portions out income in accordance with productivity. It is double- counting to postulate a real entity “society” outside the array of individuals, and possessing or not possessing “its” own deserved share. If by “organized society” he means the State , then the State’s “contri- butions” were compulsory and hence hardly “deserved” any pay. Furthermore, since, as we have shown, total taxation is far greater than any alleged productive contribution of the State, the rulers owe the rest of society money rather than vice versa . (3) Oliver makes the curious assertion (also made repeatedly by Frank Knight) that a man does not really deserve ethically to reap the earnings from his own unique ability. I must confess that I cannot make any sense of this position. What is more inherent in an individual, more uniquely his own, than his inher- ited ability? If he is not to reap the reward from this, conjoined with his own willed effort, what should he reap a reward from? And why, then, should someone else reap a reward from his unique ability? Why, in short, should the able be consistently penalized, and the unable consistently subsidized? Oliver’s attribution of such ability to some mystical “First Cause” will make sense only when someone is able to find the “first cause” and pay it its deserved share. Until then, any attempt to “redistribute” income from A to B would have to imply that B is the first cause. (4) Oliver confuses private, voluntary charity and grants-in- aid with compulsory “charity” or grants. Thus, he misdefines the earned-income, free-market doctrine as saying that “a per- son should support himself and his legitimate dependents, with- out asking for special favors or calling upon outside parties for aid.” While many individualists would accept this formulation, 308 Power and Market: Government and the Economy"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"the true free-market doctrine is that no person may coerce oth- ers into giving him aid. It makes all the difference in the world whether the aid is given voluntarily or is stolen by force. As a corollary, Oliver confuses the meaning of “power” and asserts that employers have power over employees and there- fore should be responsible for the latter’s welfare. Oliver is quite right when he says that the slave-master was responsible for his slave’s subsistence, but he doesn’t seem to realize that only the reestablishment of slavery would fit his program for labor rela- tions. To say that the feeble-minded or orphans are “wards,” as Oliver does, leads to his confusion between “wards of society” and “wards of the State.” The two are completely different, because the two institutions are not the same. The concept of “ward of society” reflects the libertarian principle that private individuals and voluntary groups may offer to care for those who desire such care. “Wards of the State,” on the contrary, are those ( a ) to whose care everyone is compelled by violence to contribute, and ( b ) who are subject to State dictation whether they like it or not. Oliver’s conclusion that “Every normal adult should have a fair chance to support himself, and, in the absence of this opportunity, he should be supported by the State” is a melange of logical fallacies. What is a “fair chance,” and how can it be defined? Further, in contrast to Spencer’s Law of Equal Free- dom (or to our suggested Law of Total Freedom), “every” can- not here be fulfilled, since there is no such real entity as the “State.” Anyone supported by the “State” must, ipso facto , be supported by someone else in the society. Therefore, not everyone can be supported—especially, of course, if we define “fair chance” as the absence of interference or coercive penalizing of a person’s ability. (5) Oliver realizes that some earned-income theorists com- bine their doctrines with a “finders, keepers” theory. But he can find no underlying principle here and calls it merely an accepted rule of the business game. Yet “finders, keepers” is not only Antimarket Ethics: A Praxeological Critique 309"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"310 Power and Market: Government and the Economy based on principle; it is just as much a corollary of the underly- ing postulates of a regime of liberty as is the earned-income the- ory. For an unowned resource should, according to basic prop- erty rights doctrine, become owned by whoever, through his efforts, brings this resource into productive use. This is the “finders, keepers” or “first-user, first-owner” principle. It is the only theory consistent with the abolition of theft (including government ownership), so that every useful resource is always owned by some nonthief. 37 37 Oliver often cites in his support the essay of Frank H. Knight, “Freedom as Fact and Criterion” in Freedom and Reform (New York: Harper & Bros., 1947), pp. 2–3. There is no need to elaborate further on Knight’s essay, except to note his attack on Spencer for adopting both “psychological hedonism” and “ethical hedonism.” Without analyzing Spencer in detail, we can, by a proper interpretation, make very good sense of combining both positions. First, it is necessary to change “hedo- nism”—the pursuit of “pleasure”—to eudaemonism —the pursuit of happi- ness . Second, “psychological eudaemonism,” the view that “every individ- ual universally and necessarily seeks his own maximum happiness,” fol- lows from the praxeological axiom of human action. From the fact of pur- pose, this truth follows, but only when “ happiness ” is interpreted in a for- mal, categorial, and ex ante sense, i.e., “happiness” here means whatever the individual chooses to rank highest on his value scale. Ethical eudaemonism—that an individual should seek his maximum happiness—can also be held by the same theorist, when happiness is here interpreted in a substantive and ex post sense, i.e., that each individual should pursue that course which will, as a consequence , make him happier. To illustrate, a man may be an alcoholic. The eudaemonist may make these two pronouncements: (1) A is pursuing that course which he most prefers (“psychological eudaemonism”); and (2) A is injuring his happi- ness, this judgment being based on “happiness rules” derived from the study of the nature of man, and therefore should reduce his alcohol intake to the point that his happiness is no longer impaired (“ethical eudae- monism”).

Economics: Its Nature and Its Uses E CONOMICS PROVIDES US WITH TRUE laws, of the type if A, then B, then C, etc. Some of these laws are true all the time, i.e., A always holds (the law of diminishing marginal utility, time pref- erence, etc.). Others require A to be established as true before the consequents can be affirmed in practice. The person who identifies economic laws in practice and uses them to explain complex economic fact is, then, acting as an economic historian rather than as an economic theorist. He is an historian when he seeks the casual explanation of past facts; he is a forecaster when he attempts to predict future facts. In either case, he uses absolutely true laws, but must determine when any particular law applies to a given situation. 1 Furthermore, the laws are nec- essarily qualitative rather than quantitative, and hence, when the forecaster attempts to make quantitative predictions, he is going beyond the knowledge provided by economic science. 2 It has not often been realized that the functions of the economist on the free market differ sharply from those of the 311 7 C ONCLUSION : E CONOMICS AND P UBLIC P OLICY 1 Murray N.

What can the economist do on the purely free market? He can explain the workings of the market economy (a vital task, especially since the untutored per- son tends to regard the market economy as sheer chaos), but he can do little else. Contrary to the pretensions of many econo- mists, he is of little aid to the businessman. He cannot forecast future consumer demands and future costs as well as the busi- nessman; if he could, then he would be the businessman. The entrepreneur is where he is precisely because of his superior forecasting ability on the market. The pretensions of econome- tricians and other “model-builders” that they can precisely fore- cast the economy will always founder on the simple but devas- tating query: “If you can forecast so well, why are you not doing so on the stock market, where accurate forecasting reaps such rich rewards?” 3 It is beside the point to dismiss such a query— as many have done—by calling it “anti-intellectual”; for this is precisely the acid test of the would-be economic oracle. In recent years, new mathematico-statistical disciplines have developed—such as “operations research” and “linear program- ming”—which have professed to help the businessman make his concrete decisions. If these claims are valid, then such disci- plines are not economics at all, but a sort of management tech- nology. Fortunately, operations research has developed into a 312 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1955), pp. 81–99; P.T.

The economist is not a business technologist. 4 The economist’s role in a free society, then, is purely educa- tional. But when government—or any other agency using vio- lence—intervenes in the market, the “usefulness” of the econo- mist expands. The reason is that no one knows, for example, what future consumer demands in some line will be. Here, in the realm of the free market, the economist must give way to the entrepreneurial forecaster. But government actions are very dif- ferent, because the problem now is precisely what the conse- quences of governmental acts will be. In short, the economist may be able to tell what the effects of an increased demand for butter will be; but this is of little practical use, since the busi- nessman is primarily interested, not in this chain of conse- quences—which he knows well enough for his purposes—but in whether or not such an increase will take place. For a govern- mental decision, on the other hand, the “whether” is precisely what the citizenry must decide. So here the economist, with his knowledge of the various alternative consequences, comes into his own. Furthermore, the consequences of a governmental act, being indirect, are much more difficult to analyze than the con- sequences of an increase in consumer demand for a product. Longer chains of praxeological reasoning are required, particu- larly for the needs of the decision-makers. The consumer’s deci- sion to purchase butter and the entrepreneur’s decision about entering into the butter business do not require praxeological reasoning, but rather insight into the concrete data. The judg- ing and evaluation of a governmental act (e.g., an income tax), however, require long chains of praxeological reasoning.

In a ham- pered market economy, indeed, the economist often becomes useful to the businessman—where chains of economic reason- ing become important, e.g., in analyzing the effects of credit expansion or an income tax and, in many cases, in spreading this knowledge to the outside world. The political economist, in fact, is indispensable to any citi- zen who frames ethical judgments in politics. Economics can never by itself supply ethical dicta, but it does furnish existen- tial laws that cannot be ignored by anyone framing ethical con- clusions—just as no one can rationally decide whether product X is a good or a bad food until its consequences on the human body are ascertained and taken into account. 2. Implicit Moralizing: The Failures of Welfare Economics As we have reiterated, economics cannot by itself establish ethical judgments, and it can and should be developed in a Wert- frei manner. This is true whether we adopt the modern disjunc- tion between fact and value, or whether we adhere to the classi- cal philosophical tradition that there can be a “science of ethics.” For even if there can be, economics may not by itself establish it. Yet economics, especially of the modern “welfare” variety, is filled with implicit moralizing—with unanalyzed ad hoc ethical statements that are either silently or under elaborate camouflage slipped into the deductive system. Elsewhere we have analyzed many of these attempts, e.g., the “old” and the “new” welfare economics. 5 Interpersonal utility comparisons, the “compensation principle,” the “social welfare function,” are typical examples. We have also seen the absurdity of the search for criteria of “just” taxation before the justice of taxation itself 314 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy 5 Rothbard, “Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Eco- nomics,” pp. 243 ff."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"has been proven. Other instances of illegitimate moralizing are the doctrine that product differentiation harms consumers by raising prices and restricting production (a doctrine based on the false assumptions that consumers do not want these differences, and that cost curves remain the same); the spurious “proof” that, given the total tax bill, the income tax is “better” for con- sumers than excise taxes; 6 and the mythical distinction between “social cost” and “private cost.” Neither can economists legitimately adopt the popular method of maintaining ethical neutrality while pronouncing on policy, that is, taking not their own but the “community’s” val- ues, or those they attribute to the community, and simply advis- ing others how to attain these ends. An ethical judgment is an ethical judgment, no matter who or how many people make it. It does not relieve the economist of the responsibility for hav- ing made ethical judgments to plead that he has borrowed them from others. The economist who calls for egalitarian measures because “The people want more equality,” is no longer strictly an economist. He has abandoned ethical neutrality, and he abandons it not a whit more if he calls for equality simply because he wants it so. Value judgments remain only value judg- ments; they receive no special sanctification by virtue of the number of their adherents. And uncritically adhering to all the prevailing ethical judgments is simply to engage in apologetics for the status quo . 7 I do not at all mean to deprecate value judgments; men do and must always make them. But I do say that the injection of value judgments takes us beyond the bounds of economics per Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy 315 6 See Richard Goode, “Direct versus Indirect Taxes: Welfare Implica- tions,” Public Finance/Finance Publique (XI, 1, 1956), pp. 95–98; David W alker, “The Direct-Indirect Tax Problem: Fifteen Years of Contro versy,” Public Finance/Finance Publique (X, 2, 1955), pp. 153–76. 7 For a critique of “realism” as a ground for status quo apologetics by social scientists, see Clarence E.

The economist, of course, is a technician who explains the consequences of various actions. But he cannot advise a man on the best route to achieve certain ends without committing him- self to those ends. An economist hired by a businessman implic- itly commits himself to the ethical valuation that increasing that businessman’s profits is good (although, as we have seen, the economist’s role in business would be negligible on the free market). An economist advising the government on the most efficient way of rapidly influencing the money market is thereby committing himself to the desirability of government manipula- tion of that market. The economist cannot function as an adviser without committing himself to the desirability of the ends of his clients. The utilitarian economist tries to escape this policy dilemma by assuming that everyone’s ends are really the same—at least ultimately. If everyone’s ends are the same, then an economist, by showing that Policy A cannot lead to Goal G, is justified in saying that A is a “bad” policy, since everyone values A in order to achieve G. Thus, if two groups argue over price controls, the utilitarian tends to assume that the proven consequences of maximum price controls—shortages, disruptions, etc.—will make the policy bad from the point of view of the advocates of the legislation. Yet the advocates may favor price controls any- way, for other reasons—love of power, the building of a politi- cal machine and its consequent patronage, desire to injure the masses, etc. It is certainly overly sanguine to assume that every- one’s ends are the same, and therefore the utilitarian shortcut to policy conclusions is also inadequate. 8 316 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy 8 It is probably true, of course, that general knowledge of these conse- quences of price control would considerably reduce social support for this measure. But this is a politico-psychological, not a praxeological, statement."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy 317 3. Economics and Social Ethics If the economist qua economist must be Wertfrei , does this leave him any room for significant pronouncements on ques- tions of public policy? Superficially, it would seem not, but this entire work has been testimony to the contrary. Briefly, the Wertfrei economist can do two things: (1) he can engage in a praxeological critique of inconsistent and meaningless ethical programs (as we have tried to show in the preceding chapter); and (2) he can explicate analytically all the myriad consequences of different political systems and different methods of govern- ment intervention. In the former task, we have seen that many prominent ethical critiques of the market are inconsistent or meaningless, whereas attempts to prove the same errors in regard to the ethical underpinnings of a free society are shown to be fallacious. In the latter role, the economist has an enormous part to play. He can analyze the consequences of the free market and of various systems of coerced and hampered exchange. One of the conclusions of this analysis is that the purely free market maxi- mizes social utility, because every participant in the market ben- efits from his voluntary participation. On the free market, every man gains; one man’s gain, in fact, is precisely the consequence of his bringing about the gain of others. When an exchange is coerced, on the other hand—when criminals or governments intervene—one group gains at the expense of others. On the free market, everyone earns according to his productive value in sat- isfying consumer desires. Under statist distribution, everyone earns in proportion to the amount he can plunder from the pro- ducers. The market is an interpersonal relation of peace and harmony; statism is a relation of war and caste conflict. Not only do earnings on the free market correspond to productivity, but freedom also permits a continually enlarged market, with a wider division of labor, investment to satisfy future wants, and increased living standards. Moreover, the market permits the ingenious device of capitalist calculation , a calculation necessary"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"318 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy to the efficient and productive allocation of the factors of pro- duction. Socialism cannot calculate and hence must either shift to a market economy or revert to a barbaric standard of living after its plunder of the preexisting capital structure has been exhausted. And every intermixture of government ownership or interference in the market distorts the allocation of resources and introduces islands of calculational chaos into the economy. Government taxation and grants of monopolistic privilege (which take many subtle forms) all hamper market adjustments and lower general living standards. Government inflation not only must injure half the population for the benefit of the other half, but may also lead to a business-cycle depression or collapse of the currency. We cannot outline here the entire analysis of this volume. Suffice it to say that in addition to the praxeological truth that (1) under a regime of freedom, everyone gains, whereas (2) under statism, some gain (X) at the expense of others (Y), we can say something else. For, in all these cases, X is not a pure gainer. The indirect long-run consequences of his statist privi- lege will redound to what he would generally consider his dis- advantage —the lowering of living standards, capital consump- tion, etc. X’s exploitation gain, in short, is clear and obvious to everyone. His future loss, however, can be comprehended only by praxeological reasoning. A prime function of the economist is to make this clear to all the potential X’s of the world. I would not join with some utilitarian economists in saying that this set- tles the matter and that, since we are all agreed on ultimate ends, X will be bound to change his position and support a free society. It is certainly conceivable that X’s high time prefer- ences, or his love of power or plunder, will lead him to the path of statist exploitation even when he knows all the consequences. In short, the man who is about to plunder is already familiar with the direct, immediate consequences. When praxeology informs him of the longer-run consequences, this information may often count in the scales against the action. But it may also not be enough to tip the scales. Furthermore, some may prefer"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy 319 these long-run consequences. Thus, the OPA director who finds that maximum price controls lead to shortages may (1) say that shortages are bad, and resign; (2) say that shortages are bad, but give more weight to other considerations, e.g., love of power or plunder, or his high time preference; or (3) believe that shortages are good , either out of hatred for others or from an ascetic ethic. And from the standpoint of praxeology, any of these positions may well be adopted without saying him nay. 4. The Market Principle and the Hegemonic Principle Praxeological analysis of comparative politico-economic sys- tems can be starkly summed up in the following table: S OME C ONSEQUENCES OF : T HE M ARKET P RINCIPLE T HE H EGEMONIC P RINCIPLE individual freedom coercion general mutual benefit exploitation—benefit of one (maximized social utility) group at expense of another mutual harmony caste conflict: war of all against all peace war power of man over nature power of man over man most efficient satisfaction of disruption of want-satisfaction consumer wants economic calculation calculational chaos incentives for production destruction of incentives: and advance in living capital consumption and standards regression of living standards The reader will undoubtedly ask: How can all the various systems be reduced to such a simple two-valued schema? Does not this grossly distort the rich complexity of political systems?"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"320 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy On the contrary, this dichotomy is a crucial one. No one dis- putes the fact that, historically, political systems have differed in degree —that they have never been pure examples of the market or of the hegemonic principle. But these mixtures can be ana- lyzed only by breaking them down into their components, their varying blends of the two polar principles. On Crusoe’s and Fri- day’s island, there are basically two types of interpersonal rela- tions or exchanges: the free or voluntary, and the coerced or hegemonic. There is no other type of social relation . Every time a free, peaceful unit-act of exchange occurs, the market principle has been put into operation; every time a man coerces an exchange by the threat of violence, the hegemonic principle has been put to work. All the shadings of society are mixtures of these two primary elements. The more the market principle prevails in a society, therefore, the greater will be that society’s freedom and its prosperity. The more the hegemonic principle abounds, the greater will be the extent of slavery and poverty. There is a further reason for the aptness of this polar analy- sis. For it is a peculiarity of hegemony that every coercive inter- vention in human affairs brings about further problems that call for the choice; repeal the initial intervention or add another one. It is this feature that makes any “mixed economy” inher- ently unstable, tending always toward one or the other polar opposite—pure freedom or total statism. It does not suffice to reply that the world has always been in the middle anyway, so why worry? The point is that no zone in the middle is stable, because of its own self-created problems (its own “inner con- tradictions,” as a Marxist would say). And the result of these problems is to push the society inexorably in one direction or the other. The problems, in fact, are recognized by everyone, regardless of his value system or the means he proposes for meeting the situation. What happens if socialism is established? Stability is not reached there, either, because of the poverty, calculational chaos, etc., which socialism brings about. Socialism may continue a"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy 321 long time if, as under a primitive caste system, the people believe that the system is divinely ordained, or if partial and incomplete socialism in one or a few countries can rely on the foreign mar- ket for calculation. Does all this mean that the purely free econ- omy is the only stable system? Praxeologically, yes; psychologi- cally, the issue is in doubt. The unhampered market is free of self-created economic problems; it furnishes the greatest abun- dance consistent with man’s command over nature at any given time. But those who yearn for power over their fellows, or who wish to plunder others, as well as those who fail to comprehend the praxeological stability of the free market, may well push the society back on the hegemonic road. To return to the cumulative nature of intervention, we may cite as a classic example the modern American farm program. In 1929, the government began to support artificially the prices of some farm commodities above their market price. This, of course, brought about unsold surpluses of these commodities, surpluses aggravated by the fact that farmers shifted production out of other lines to enter the now guaranteed high-price fields. Thus, the consumer paid four ways: once in taxes to subsidize the farmers, a second time in the higher prices of farm products, a third time in the wasted surpluses, and a fourth time in the deprivation of forgone products in the unsupported lines of pro- duction. But the farm surplus was a problem, recognized as such by people with all manner of value systems. What to do about it? The farm program could have been repealed, but such a course would hardly have been compatible with the statist doctrines that had brought about the support program in the first place. So, the next step was to clamp maximum production controls on the farmers who produced the supported products. The controls had to be set up as quotas for each farm, grounded on produc- tion in some past base-period, which of course cast farm pro- duction in a rapidly obsolescing mold. The quota system bol- stered the inefficient farmers and shackled the efficient ones. Paid, in effect, not to produce certain products (and, ironically, these have invariably been what the government considers the"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"322 Power and Market: Government andthe Economy “essential” products), the farmers naturally shifted to producing other products. The lower prices of the nonsupported products set up the same clamor for support there. The next plan, again a consequence of statist logic at work, was to avoid these embar- rassing shifts of production by creating a “soil bank,” whereby the government paid the farmer to make sure that the land remained completely idle . This policy deprived the consumers of even the substitute farm products. The result of the soil bank was readily predictable. Farmers put into the soil bank their poorest lands and tilled the remaining ones more intensively, thus greatly increasing their output on the better lands and con- tinuing the surplus problem as much as ever. The main differ- ence was that the farmers then received government checks for not producing anything. The cumulative logic of intervention is demonstrated in many other areas. For instance, government subsidization of poverty increases poverty and unemployment and encourages the beneficiaries to multiply their offspring, thus further inten- sifying the problem that the government set out to cure. Gov- ernment outlawing of narcotics addiction greatly raises the price of narcotics, driving addicts to crime to obtain the money. There is no need to multiply examples; they can be found in all phases of government intervention. The point is that the free-market economy forms a kind of natural order , so that any interventionary disruption creates not only disorder but the necessity for repeal or for cumulative disorder in attempting to combat it. In short, Proudhon wrote wisely when he called “Liberty the Mother, not the Daughter, of Order.” Hegemonic intervention substitutes chaos for that order. Such are the laws that praxeology presents to the human race. They are a binary set of consequences: the workings of the market principle and of the hegemonic principle. The former breeds harmony, freedom, prosperity, and order; the latter pro- duces conflict, coercion, poverty, and chaos. Such are the con- sequences between which mankind must choose.
