The dedicated capsule of instruments was launched atop anAtlas V rocket at 14:00 EST on January 19, 2006, from Pad 41 at Cape CanaveralSpace Center in Florida after an eight-day delay, initially to allow last-minutetesting of the rocket’s kerosene tank, then to avoid high winds and low cloudceilings downrange.It is compelling to picture local weather on Earth affecting the delivery of apackage at cloud-less, wind-less Pluto more than nine years later.A half hour after lift-off, the rocket’s Centaur second stage reignited theprobe and sent it into a solar-escape speed and trajectory. New Horizons crashedlunar orbit in a mere nine hours and was out of the Moon’s gravitational fieldbefore midnight.As the scientific package zips 6,200 miles above a bleak Plutonian landscape—theSun a bright star in perpetual night—Pluto becomes the last and farthest-flungmember of the original nine-body Solar System to be imaged close-up through atransiting Homo-sapiens lens.But the book (or digital display) that you hold in your hand is not just aprogram guide for an engineering feat; it is the pursuit of a mytheme, anirreducible kernel with at least three manifestations: a god, an astrologicalorganizing principle, and a planet. Pluto’s mythology, astronomy, astrology,science fiction, and politics form a series of semiotic networks that have to doless with imaging a far-off frigid rock and more with staring into a mirror ofour own cosmology in crisis.Unmanned human assignation with a planet, though a mere mite floats above an orbhundreds of thousands of times its mass and size, is never innocent and withoutmetaphysical consequences. Hours after Voyager’s close encounter with Uranus’smoon Miranda (January 28, 1986), the space shuttle Challenger exploded, drivingNASA temporarily out of the heavens. Likewise when NASA put Galileo, aplutonium-238-driven satellite, on a 108,000-miles-per-hour suicidal plunge intoJupiter’s atmosphere (September 21, 2003), the collision sent a black nuclearcloud hurtling down through the planet’s cloud layers and changed everythingabout astrological Jupiter on Earth.Borderline planet, gadfly, and changeling object, Pluto is Earth’s Planet X, avortex of seeds from beyond space and time, a quixotic 1930s dark body bundlinginconclusive physical and paraphysical equations, a mischievous intruder in thezodiac who redefines every chart by the fact that his passage along itsthreshold evokes the imperceptible shock wave of the system itself.Pluto also crosses the destiny of the human enterprise at the moment that itsown crisis transits with Pluto—a synchronicity inside the zodiac, which isSynchronicity Central anyway. Why that played out in interbellum 1930 withprecisely that elusive trans-Neptunian pellet, and again at hailing distance in2015, is a cosmic mudra of an unknown sphinx. But NASA could no more not goafter this meme in its last gasp at completing a solar circuit than it couldavoid putting a man on the Moon or send robots scuttling across equallyinscrutable Martian deserts in their time.While perhaps little more than an escaped moon or common plutino exoterically,esoterically Pluto is an alchemical vas hermeticum, a vessel that, withoutrevealing its nature, translates everything that comes into contact with it intoits own icons and symbologies. Plutonian artifacts have a Möbius Strip quality(like a barber’s pole of energy) such that their meanings oscillate, in acontinuous way, from inside their vessel onto its surface. At Pluto, oppositequalities like joy and despair, utopia and apocalypse, grace andbrutality—inside and outside—fuse or exchange properties, as they becomemomentarily indistinguishable. Much too far away to care, Pluto has bigger fishto fry.I am reminded of words that transpersonal intelligence Seth invested in ourplane via his medium Jane Roberts:“[T]his dimension [e.g., source realm] nurses your own world, reaching down intoyour system. These realities are still only those at the edge of the one inwhich you have your present existence. Far beyond are others, so alien to youthat I could not explain them. Yet they are connected with your own life, andthey find expression even within the smallest cells of your flesh.”1That’s Pluto in spades, a deep-lying chimera across which Plutonian sigilsproject a reality too alien for Earthlings to glean, transmit it right down intotheir DNA as into the quantum states of their planet’s atoms, every particle ofdust, grain of sand, and morsel of soil and stone. Even the ordinary Plutonianglob, more than 98 percent nitrogen ice, reinvents itself beyond disclosure ofits actual identity or reference point. Science simply doesn’t reach that deepinto a higher-dimensional universe; it doesn’t look far enough into the heavensto see Pluto as more than a pip of old Sol-orbiting rock (though of ambiguousenough caliber to be worth quibbling over). Of course, that’s what it is in thisdimension or at this astrophysical vibration, but who knows how many dimensionsthe starry field reflects as it twinkles from an incomprehensibly vaster sky.For these reasons I have re-scripted NASA’s secular Pluto (with its photo op) togo after a more cryptic and numinous object: Body X, bad boy of the SolarSystem, fluctuating signifier, meta-planetary dweller between planes.Again Seth, this time Seth II, a higher octave, speaks:“We do not understand the nature of the reality you are creating, even thoughthe seeds were given to you by us. We respect it and revere it. Do not let theweak sounds of this voice confuse you. The strength behind it would form theworld as you know it and sustain it for centuries.”2Do not be confused by Pluto’s minute size, remote location, pallid signal, anddemotion to a dwarf. Honor the mystery instead. It is creating our reality, eventhis nanosecond.Meta-Pluto stands for our cardinal node and cosmic key. By its dual existence itexpresses our split emanation: self and cosmos. In a realm beyond ourunderstanding, it is generating the zodiac, the starry heavens, and the termsfor this world. It is pulling souls into the current universe.This anthology provides the rubric and premise of that proposition.I had been tracking the New Horizons saga since the mission was announced in2001, at the time replacing the earlier Pluto Fast Flyby as well as its moresophisticated successor, the Pluto Kuiper Express, neither of which was everbuilt or launched. Both of them would have reached Pluto by now, or well beforethe planet had traveled so far toward aphelion (its farthest point from the Sun)that its gauze-thin atmosphere froze out, i.e., crystallized and dropped to theground in colorless snow. That process, creeping along an icy, electrostaticlattice day by day, will have wiped any remaining film from the crisp, starryPlutonian night by 2020. (The Earth’s atmosphere freezing out, by the way, wouldmean millennial blizzards depositing miles-high glaciers and icebergs on anairless terrain, then a gigantic white star exploding out of a black sky acrossa blinding snowpack of dunes covering mountains, valleys, seas, and plains.)Each mission (Flyby and Express) was canceled, in turn, for lack of funding, tobe replaced by a more efficient concept. Finally, after an intense politicalbattle, NASA got a Pluto line-item approved; hired subcontractors to fashion,program, and forge a metal bird for deployment; and fired the robot into spaceon a flight plan delivering it pretty much nonstop to where Pluto, traveling inits own eccentric orbit, would cross its path 3,464 days later give or take afortnight.NASA’s unmanned interplanetary space program took shape in the early sixtieswith Mariner’s missions to Mars and Venus. During the heyday of Solar Systemreconnaissance (from roughly 1979 through a smidgen into the aughts), probesvisited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their moons, plus the asteroidVesta (2011) and various other asteroids and comets. They and hardware fromseveral space agencies—those of the Soviet Union, China, the European Union,Japan, and India—flew by, orbited, and imaged the Moon, and the two planetscloser to the Sun than Earth, Mercury and Venus, usually as part of the samemission by using a slingshot effect from Venus to get to Mercury.The United States’s Pioneer 10 passed within eighty-one thousand miles ofJupiter in 1973, inaugurating a series of ever closer encounters with theregion’s largest planet—Jupiter is an ideal slingshot for accelerating probes toworlds beyond it too. Pioneer 11 conducted the first flyby of Saturn in 1979,and two Voyager probes soon followed it there. The second, Voyager 2, was slunginto a pre-programmed trajectory by Saturn’s gravitational field so that itintercepted Uranus in 1986 and, after being redirected by Uranian gravity, metNeptune on its ellipse in 1989.Soon after Mariner 4 reached Mars, the United States and Soviet Union beganparachuting satellites onto Venus (1966). In 1995 the United States sent a probefrom the Galileo orbiter onto Jupiter where it collected fifty-eight minutesworth of data on exospheric and thermospheric composition, temperature,radiation, band instabilities, and weather while traveling at about thirty milesper second. Before it could sink any further, it succumbed to local ambientpressure exceeding twenty-three Earth atmospheres as well as a meteor-like 307degrees Fahrenheit.En route to Jupiter, Galileo became the first artificial human object to visitan asteroid (Gaspra) and then the first to detect an asteroidal moon (Dactylcircling Ida).Ten years later NASA programmed the Huygens vehicle to separate from its Cassinispacecraft and land in the Xanadu region of Saturn’s moon Titan. It settled on ahigh-albedo elevated plain that had multiple channels running through it.In November 2014, the European Space Agency separated the Philae probe from itsRosetta spacecraft and bounced it onto the surface of Comet67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the first human touchdown on a bolide. Launched inMarch 2004 from French Guiana, Philae preceded New Horizons into space by morethan a year.And, of course, humans traveled to and walked on the Moon multiple times duringthe U.S. Apollo program, the first such manned touchdown in 1969.Only Pluto was missing. It was too out-of-the-way, negligible, and asteroid-liketo merit a detour by Voyager 2 after “Grand Tour” stops at Uranus and Neptuneand their moons. On its way to the Kuiper Belt and beyond, Voyager didn’t evenconsider Pluto—its Earthbound programmers didn’t. Their more exigent prioritieswere to measure the dwindling influence of the Sun to heliopause, to taste theinterstellar medium, and to carry a plaque into Deep Space bearing humankind’smessage to the universe.Plus the puny ninth planet wasn’t deemed worth the cost of sending a tailor-madepayload otherwise.However, after another decade of scientific advancement, a surprisingrecognition took hold: the one missing orb was accessible by new, relativelyinexpensive technology. Blueprints for Pluto flybys graduated quickly fromrecreational puzzles to concrete proposals to priority drawing boards. Fiveyears earlier the notion would have seemed both frivolous and implausible.Seven-plus years after a flyby became viable—if still only marginallyjustifiable on a cost/benefit basis—Pluto had its own select probe en route.My original query letter for this anthology began as follows:Dear Colleague,Launched in 2006, NASA’s New Horizons Pluto probe is scheduled to arrive at theplanet and its moons in July 2015. This is the last of the original planets inour solar system to be visited and photographed by NASA satellite. For therecord the binary system Pluto/Charon has three other tiny moonlets: Nix, Hydra,and one presently (2012) unnamed but tentatively Cerberus. The barycenter oftheir orbits does not lie within any single body, so “Pluto” is more properly aswarm. [For the record, the fourth moon is actually Kerberos, and a subsequentfifth was named Styx.]At North Atlantic Books we are working on an anthology of statements lookingahead this event. Our questions are:What do you think the probe will find?What would you like it to find?What might it find that would change some key paradigm or meaning?These can be answered on any level that you would like. You can answer one ormore of the questions or raise different questions and answer them. You cananswer with prose, poetry, or art. You can write on the astrology, mythology,history, or science of Pluto. The final anthology will be a pastiche ofdifferent responses and viewpoints that will form an interesting mosaic forviewing both New Horizons and the civilization that sent it.The length can be anything from a sentence to ten-plus pages.We very much respect the scientific viewpoint and will make sure that it isrepresented with integrity and respect. At the same time we are looking foresoteric, science-fiction, aesthetic, and psychospiritual approaches to thetopic.I received many thoughtful responses ranging from the literal and earnestlyscientific (for instance, one-time astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman’s “measurements ofa thin residual atmosphere” and a College of the Atlantic student’s “somenever-before-seen quasi-organic self-replicator”), to magical realism andspeculative kōans (Jonathan Lethem’s “dead pets” and Philip Wohlstetter’s “timethat Proust lost”), to archetypal induction (Robert Sardello’s “interior ofmatter” and “luminous darkness” and Nathan Schwartz-Salant’s “mystery ofmanifestation”), to science fiction and sci-fi satire (Charley Murphy’s“hyperintelligent squid” and “58 genders”), plus medleys of these (RossHamilton’s “swarming corkscrew/fractal alchemy” and “giant, nearly undetectabletransparent quartz sphere owning a small frigid core of rotating parts mimickingVatican City”).I didn’t encourage pets in my call for submissions, but a surprising number ofaspirants took that tack—Pluto is a popular tag for recruiting nonhumans intocivilized society, an ideal blend of consonants and vowels both goofy andfrisky, a bit gamy, and bearing a fierce or somber enough legacy to hold its ownin the wild. If I had not closed the barn door, a menagerie of dogs, cats,rabbits, birds, and snakes would have run riot through this anthology. Myfavorite animal submission opened in true Pluto spirit:In the spring of 1982 our blond cat “Larch,” who not only glowed at night, butalso lacking claws, balls, and any farm sense, had lasted less than a month atour new raw land homestead (but, oh was he blissed-out for that brief month, hisfirst away from city streets). We were pretty sure it had been an owl that tookhim, but it could just as easily have been a red-tailed hawk or golden eagle.Thinking we needed a companion for our black lab, Moon-shadow, and a mouser forour rustic tent camp, we quickly found a replacement in the form of a tinyall-black male kitten whom we named “Pluto.”3I almost included James Moore’s skillfully rendered cats for how they impartedPluto’s dark luminosity as well as its motif of abduction by powerful,paradigm-shifting shapes—in Larch’s case a mongrel winged thing from on high.But feline Pluto’s otherwise worthy and charming exploits matched this anthologyonly by synchronicity, or in the spirit that everything is congruent toeverything else under, or grazed by, Pluto.In its realized form, New Horizons for a Lost Horizon visits themes and motifscommon to Pluto (god, planet, and/or sign), some of them more than others.Though I had considered grouping submissions by subtopics, that would haveundermined the reciprocity and synergy of the categories. Discursion about Plutotends to fuse astronomy, astrology, and mythology, even when its author is nottrying to, or trying not to—maybe it’s the generic Plutonian weirdness andsurrealism.Central overlapping threads include: (1) the astrophysics, exogeology, andexometeorology of a trans-Neptunian object/dwarf planet; (2) the physics,astrology, and hyper-physics of a complex multi-“planet” swarm in mean-motionresonance; (3) Kuiper Belt landscapes and astronomy; (4) the Pluto/Persephonemyth of abduction and commutation as well as a range of psychological parablesand complexes underlying and emergent from it; (5) the baseline astrology ofPluto, including its conjunctions on Earth with shadows and traumas, death andresurrection, caves and buried treasures, invisible wealth, and enantiodromia (aprinciple of equilibrium articulated by Carl Jung whereby a psychologicalprocess or cultural event automatically generates its opposite in order torestore cosmic balance); (6) the ritual of assigning the name “Pluto” to theninth planet; (7) the 2006 redaction of Pluto’s status to dwarf planet; (8)realms of hyperdimensionality and hyperobjectivity suggested or prompted byPluto; (9) surrealism and magical realism around lost objects, exotic creatures,paradoxical emanations, and haunting nostalgias, likewise connoted or triggeredby the ninth planet; (10) a “terraformed” stepping stone and gateway linking theSolar System to the outer universe; and (11) a floating orbital chip of ETvisitation and planetary engineering, splattered or set in place half a billionyears (or even longer) ago.The latter would have required at least a Type II or perhaps a Type IIIcivilization. On this scale (first proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomerNikolai Kardashev and named after him), Type I civilizations harness the energyoutput of an entire planet, usually their own, drawing power out of hurricanesand volcanoes while altering tsunamis and earthquakes to their designs and uses.They also likely run fusion engines and photonic star drives.Type II civilizations harness the energy output of a star, usually their own,and generate about ten billion times the output of a Type I civilization. Theyprobably have perfected antimatter drives and nano-probes. Various Star Trekepisodes depict a conjectural future Earth as a Type II civilizationencountering other Type IIs in their junkets into the universe.Type III civilizations harness the energy output of a galaxy, or about tenbillion times the productivity of a Type II civilization. Having colonizedhundreds (or even thousands) of light-years of territory, they draw heat,electromagnetism, fission, fusion, and unimaginable sorts of “burn” fromhundreds of billions of stars and dimensional frequencies. To get around theirgalaxy (or other galaxies), they probably use Planck energy propulsion, quantumentanglement, dark-energy drives, black holes, and matteras well asinformation-superposition.There is no guarantee, of course, that representatives of any of thesecivilizations even exist, but Pluto and a few other Solar System bodies (someodd-looking asteroids and moons) might be the handiwork or remnants of one oftheir visitations or regional projects. Cosmic paranoia buffs have it thatChuryumov-Gerasimenko is not a comet but an invading or abandoned spacecraft—andhardly a dead or quiet one: the black hulk is dispatching spooky radio signals,beckoning and summoning Homo sapiens (or stalking us like a Trojan horse). Elsewhy spend billions of dollars on a 3907-day sally merely to park expensivehardware on a remote random stone? Some conspiracists believe that real dangeris involved: “Whatever this object is, it did not ask to be found orscrutinized.”Well, you can look at Philae’s copious pictures of its “comet,” listen to thepurported beacon (online), and cast your own ballot: either this is a large,irregular stellar-forged kernel of exogeological popcorn or it is a time-damagedspore of Brobdingnagian interstellar engineering by alien welders, complete withdecks, turrets, a wall, and a habitable interior.Earth, by the way, sits on the Kardashev scale at Type 0, about two hundredyears from Type I (if it makes it), a few thousand years from Type II, and abouta million years from Type III.All of this is speculative and extravagant, but exactly the sort of speculationand exotica that Pluto sponsors.The trans-Neptunian-bound craft was designed and built by Johns HopkinsUniversity’s Applied Physics Laboratory. The principal mission investigator was(and is) Dr. Alan Stern, executive director of the Space Science and EngineeringDivision of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, NASA’ssubcontractor for the project. Stern and his colleagues conceived a viable andcheap enough program to replace the rejected Pluto Kuiper Express, yet slip asimilar mission past congressional oversight.As noted, the New Horizons payload was accelerated directly into anEarth-and-solar-escape trajectory so that it didn’t get yoked by locally issuedgravity to circling its source planet like a telecommunications satellite.Breaking Earth orbit, New Horizons eventually attained an Earth-relativevelocity of about 36,373 miles per hour (9.9 miles per second), a record for ahuman-made object.Here are some snippets worth sharing with Pluto neophytes—experts, be patient;everything below is not common knowledge: 1. The interplanetary satellite doesn’t represent a sudden revival of theUnited States unmanned space program or an au courant jaunt to the outer SolarSystem. New Horizons was launched when NASA was at the tail end of itsplanetary-exploration phase but could still sell (if barely) “frivolous”celestial research to Congress.The excursion could not have been budgeted today unless a private company likeDiscovery Channel or Home Box Office undertook it as an entrepreneurial venture,a multi-season outer-space reality show. National commitment and funding are nolonger there, in fact even for our country’s more utilitarian and downhomeinfrastructure of roads and bridges.The reason that New Horizons is so tardy, arriving at Pluto just now, almost tenyears after its launch, is a matter of the length of time it takes even anexpress package to reach the ninth solar orbit from the third. Pluto averagesabout 3.67 billion miles from the Sun. Because of this immense remove, NewHorizons is a delayed-delivery event. When it finally arrives, it will seem asthough NASA is back in the planetary-exploration game—and space officials andthe media will play it that way—but, for the most part, no one will be trying tofool anyone; it’s just that genuine explanations based on Pluto’s distance,hence New Horizons’s late arrival, will be lost or overlooked factoids under thedrum-beating and hoopla of a successful mission otherwise (presuming, of course,that the satellite does not encounter any small unforeseeable meteors, nomadiccentaurs, or meddling ETs during its last months en route). The public is notattuned to cosmic nuances anyway (real “space-time,” orbital geometry, ordifferential calculus, especially in an immediate-gratification video-gamedecade), so the reality and pizzazz of Pluto will trump the incidental lengthand sheer duration of the journey. NASA needs—and should not be begrudged—itsadditional fifteen minutes, or six months, of fame.In another mood Pluto visitation evokes the fifties, as if the craft had beenlaunched from a Flash Gordon spaceport, traipsed unnoticed through heavens ofThe Twilight Zone and Star Trek, and emerged unscathed, winging over Plutonianmodernity. That dogged malaprop will cling to the grids of raw images from NewHorizons, as high-pixel post-Hubble astronomy will not be able to scrub offplanet Mongo or Queen Fria’s ice kingdom of Frigia or (for that matter) tracesof Bajoran wormholes or vestiges of the Deep Space Nine outpost once calledTerek Nor—but neither will hypothetical Plutonians, Romulans, Sulibans, andCardassians be able to cancel those relentless nanometers and dot matrices ofblack dead stone (once they get released from image clean-up).Oscillations between a geological object and a mythical landscape are intrinsicby now, as they parallel feedback between the astronomical planet and itsastrological sign. 2. “Pluto” turns out not to be Pluto. That is, it is not Planet X for whichastronomers were searching in February 1930 when Clyde Tombaugh, from a mountainplateau in northern Arizona, found the frozen rock wandering in Gemini and gaveit full planetary honors and (later) a Roman name. Thereafter, Pluto and itsorbit served as representational proxy, astronomically and astrologically, forthe missing Planet X. 3. Though Pluto is technically the outermost “planet,” its erratic orbitactually passes inside Neptune’s for brief periods; it did so between December11, 1978 and February 11, 1999, and will next repeat the stunt in 230 years,making Neptune temporarily the outermost original planet again. 4. The name Pluto was adopted piecemeal, gradually overtaking more popularalternatives like Lowell (for astronomer Percival Lowell’s solution of itsorbit), Janus (for its essential dual nature and position facing both the SolarSystem and whatever lies beyond), Planet X (Pluto’s name before it was found,and a nod to its ambiguous status afterwards), and the early favorite, Minerva(for her wisdom underlying Lowell’s grail, her companion owl in eternal night,her unfilled feminine slot in the zodiac, and her dramatic cosmologicalappearance, armed at birth with weapons from the godhead of Jupiter).However, once “Pluto” stuck, mythological aspects of the Graeco-Roman god of theUnderworld poured into the new body. These also imbued mathematical andnumerological aspects of the planet’s orbit in its conjunctions, oppositions,squares, trines, etc., with those of Sol’s other bodies, including the Earth, toproduce an overall Plutonian meaning-set and symbology which then interactedwith cross-cultural tropes to inspire an esoteric philosophy under theplanetary—now minor-planetary—designation “134440 Pluto.” A mytheme and esoterickingdom were born.All this may have little or nothing to do with the celestial bobbin, which isprobably just a large centaur or escaped Neptunian satellite, but—you knowsomething?—they are no longer separable. Even astronomers can’t pry them apart. 5. Pluto was not named after the Disney cartoon pup. The company dog’s namewas changed from Rover to Pluto in 1931 to take advantage of the buzz generatedby the new planet—corporate America rarely misses a free media bonanza! Eversince, Pluto has been a moderately popular canine and feline name, in partbecause of the Disney choice and in part because it sounds “cuter” than mere icyspace debris or the Lord of Hell. 6. Except for subliminal reasons, it is hard to explain why NASA officialsprioritized Pluto for its current “last” unmanned planetary mission given thatit is a barren rock with only the remotest chance of life or anything out of theasteroidal ordinary.At one level, it was probably meticulousness: finishing the house tour of theold Solar System. However, there are some regional virtues. Because Pluto liesin the outer rung of the Sun’s gyre, far from the hearth, it is a frozen remnantof the System’s origin. By contrast, other rocky planets, asteroids, and moonsmost similar to Pluto in that regard—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Juno,Europa, Callisto, Rhea, Miranda, Triton, etc.—have all been altered to varyingdegrees by volcanism, flowing liquids, planetesimal and meteor bombardment,habitation, etc.Meanwhile the gas giants of the outer Solar System are where most of theSystem’s cosmological material not in the Sun itself is stored in giganticgravitationally-curved deposits: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Plutomore resembles the moons of those worlds than it does the worlds themselves, afactor leading to its demotion.The astronomical themes associated with Pluto are among those common to theKuiper Belt more than the Jovian realm. Solid materials and mass thin out as theeffects of solar heat and planetary gravity diffuse. The outcome is frigidity,darkness, and geochemical inertia as well as preserved conditions from theoriginal swirl of gas and dust that birthed Sun, planets, moons, comets,meteors, asteroids, planetary rings, centaurs, and assorted anomalous objects.Pluto is relatively unchanged from birth, in suspended animation. It providesproportionately an unaltered, pristine glimpse of an early geological phase ofplanet formation everywhere.After all, every planet started out as a molten hydrogen dimple and, beforethat, galactic dust and, before that, an ember of a star.So, scrutiny of Pluto is both a late second pass over the satellites of the fourgas and ice giants and a first glimpse of Kuiper Belt landscapes and objects(KBOs) and the origin of the System itself. Pluto serves as a prototype, avestige, a relic, and an archaeological marker of an earlier time. 7. The mission name New Horizons was chosen, in part, to match its initialsto those of Plutonian moons Nix and Hydra. Decades earlier the name of theplanet won out for analogous reasons; its first two letters honored Pickeringand Lowell, two astronomers whose quest for Planet X led to Pluto’s discovery byMr. Tombaugh (Lowell preferred the “PL” as “Percival Lowell”). 8. The spacecraft carries about an ounce of Tombaugh’s ashes, while the dustcounter in its payload was named after Venetia Burney, the eleven-year-oldEnglish child who won an unofficial sweepstakes by getting a telegraph toTombaugh (via her grandfather, his colleague) recommending a mythological namethat Tombaugh liked enough to sponsor for his pebble. 9. On June 13, 2006, New Horizons passed within 63,185 miles of the mile-longasteroid designated 132524 APL by Terrans, and checked it out.On February 28, 2007, the probe made a near approach to Jupiter, only 1.4million miles from the System’s largest body (next to the Sun) at perijove. Theflyby gave it a significant gravitational boost, increasing its speed by aboutnine thousand miles per hour. The satellite tested its instruments on the Jovianatmosphere, magnetosphere, and moons. Then it went into hibernation, preservingits resources (and appetite) for the main course. Though New Horizons was makingrecord time, Jupiter orbits the Sun at a “mere” 484 million miles, so NewHorizons still had more than three billion miles and eight years of travel togo!10. New Horizons first imaged its primary target, Pluto-Charon, from afar inSeptember 2006. Yet it was not until July 2013 that it drew close enough toresolve Pluto and its moon Charon into two separate objects. By then radiosignals took about four hours to travel from the craft’s antenna to stations onEarth.11. New Horizons will spend only about twenty-four hours, one Gaian day,accomplishing its Pluto-related goals as it whizzes past the system. At thatpoint it will be the first Earth mission to a trans-Neptunian world, the firstto a double planet, and the first to a Kuiper Belt Object. During New Horizons’sroaming peep at Pluto-Charon—sightseeing while conducting forensics at more thanthirty-one thousand miles per hour—its paraphernalia will frisk the geology,surface composition, and atmospheric structure of the planet.The fact that Pluto even has an atmosphere was first established in themid-eighties by astronomers observing the dimming rate of stars as they wereocculted by the tiny planet passing in front of them. If Pluto had noatmosphere, selected twinkles would have bleared out abruptly. Instead, theywent through brief, subtle fades.Spectrographic analysis from Earth disclosed a thin envelope of gases—nitrogen,methane, and carbon monoxide—around Pluto, at about one seven hundred-thousandththe atmospheric pressure of Earth. Not much flatus but not entirely waftlesseither. This exotic haze forms as Pluto approaches the Sun and its icessublimate while cooling the planet’s surface in an anti-greenhouse effect. To anastronaut confronting the likes of negative 382 degrees Fahrenheit, Pluto’sballpark norm, another eighteen degrees either way is probably moot.As Pluto moves away from the Sun, its gases liquefy and freeze, eventuallyfalling to the surface. As stray quanta of sunlight and charged solar particlesfind their way there, amplified by the planet’s extreme axial tilt and orbitaleccentricity, they drive photolysis—chemical conversion—for instance, methaneinto ethane. Since telescopic observation, this has caused a general reddeningof Pluto’s surface, brightening of its northern polar region, and darkening ofits southern pole. New Horizons will also investigate Pluto’s largest moonCharon (from pericharon at seventeen thousand miles away) and countless smallermoons (including the presently resolved Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx). Then itwill head toward as-yet-undesignated farther objects in the Kuiper Belt and OortCloud: hello-goodbye, Pluto; we hardly knew ye.Of course, mission parameters and apsides (peripluto, pericharon, perinix,perihydra, etc.) may be altered by NASA as the probe approaches assignation.You might wonder, with all the resources and fuss invested in New Horizons—anepic transit plus advanced strategies for pulling information out of theorbiting object and its suborbital moons—why the spacecraft doesn’t just settleinto orbit, become part of the regional swarm, and then take its own sweet timeharvesting data? Why consume the better part of a decade crossing so many barrenleagues to go racing by at metaphorical warp speed?There is a reason. Given the thrice-postponed launch date, it wasn’t possible tostore enough fuel on board (using 2006 chemical-propulsion technology) to brakeNew Horizons into a planetary orbit and also get the spacecraft to Pluto beforea potential early freeze-out of its atmosphere. In addition, bizarre as it mayseem, the slower “approach speed” needed for delicate orbit insertion at a bodyas small, hence lacking in gravitational heft, as Pluto, would have requiredalmost a decade of additional travel time! New Horizons is smoking like a batout of hell (or the proverbial shit through a goose), i.e., so briskly on asolar-escape trajectory that even a Jovian planet might have trouble snaggingit. That is barely fast enough to beat the cosmic clock, yet also too fast tocurb at Plutonian scale.Scale can distort common parameters into astonishing incongruities. How often dofuel weight and critical braking speed add ten years to a journey?When New Horizons was fired into the open universe from Cape Canaveral, Plutowas a full-fledged member of the planetary fraternity, every bit a tantamountcomrade in a lodge that included Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, etc., butnot asteroids or centaurs.In 2006, soon after the launch, the ninth and outermost world was dictatoriallyand insultingly “downgraded” from a planet to a dwarf planet (insulting, thatis, to NASA, Alan Stern, and Pluto fans everywhere). The demotion undercut amission already deemed (by some) a scientifically trivial escapade, more asporting event and nerd master challenge, to put icing on the Grand Tour, than awarranted excursion with reciprocal astronomical payoff—sort of along the linesof, “Why Pluto?” “Because it’s there!”Presto, it’s not there. A half-pint, hardly worth the cost of the hydrazine,occupies the site of the planet formerly known as Pluto. What an anticlimax!What a comedown!Since turf wars among scientists are usually waged by proxy or bait-and-switchbehind the scenes, we may never know all the motives and nuances triggeringPluto’s sudden deplanetization but it was a shot across the bow ofStern-and-crew’s probe.Richard Hoagland considers the denigration an intentional if sly response to NewHorizons, arising from internecine NASA battles entangled with security-circlecover-ups (as well as a caveat to potential whistleblowers). Readers of hispiece can weigh the credibility of such conspiracy and disinformation claims.In any case, after much debate and with significant dissension, theInternational Astronomical Union (IAU) finally declared that Pluto could not bea planet, essentially because it was too small and an outlier, though theyquibbled for months about how planethood was to be defined so as to account foran existing member’s impromptu exclusion and sudden failure to make the cut.Less than 5 percent of the astronomers in the world actually cast ballots, sothe verdict was less democratic, at least demographically, than a presidentialelection decided by the Supreme Court.If not a subterfuge, then why was Pluto abruptly and peremptorily demoted?Actually it wasn’t abrupt. As Pluto’s vital statistics and actual nature weregradually clarified, it seemed less and less like a legitimate member of anexclusive club.The revaluation began in 1978 when the discovery of Charon allowed the fringeworld’s indeterminate mass to be calculated at only about one twenty-fifth thatof Mercury, the next smallest valid orb. It was less than even Luna, Earth’sMoon, and certainly less than other large moons like Jupiter’s Ganymede andSaturn’s Titan. Its size was, in fact, more in keeping with other distant KuiperBelt worlds that were being culled from the heavens by increasingly refinedastronomical equipment during the nineties and aughts.More than half a century after Pluto was enrolled, candidates like Quaoar,Varuna, Makemake, and Sedna, were lining up faster than their qualificationscould be evaluated. By then a Graeco-Roman Solar System (with Pluto a cherishedmember) had been in place long enough to consecrate its count, jazz, andmnemonic devices at least in people’s minds and loyalties. So, astronomers wereparalyzed as to what to do about the gathering throng of Kuiper BeltObjects—trans-Plutonian Pluto surrogates—and their burgeoning controversy.In addition to its small size, Pluto was suspect because (1) it shares acluttered orbit with many near twins (dubbed plutinos); (2) it strays from theSolar System’s ecliptic, penetrating and leaving it like a sewing needle throughfabric; (3) it is really a double-planet with Charon; and (4) as noted, it moreresembles the growing group of similar, ever more distant KBOs than its felloweight full-fledged colleagues.Plutinos are alternate “Plutos” in the same approximate orbit as Pluto itself,all of them governed by powerful 2:3 mean-motion resonance from Neptune, thenearest orb of any size.Sixteen plutinos are large enough and bright enough to classify as worlds. Twohave planetary names: Ixion and Orcus. Yet like ring fragments around Saturn,the number of smaller plutinos is near limitless.Then, of the approaching-twenty Pluto-similar bodies that have been found in thefarther Kuiper Belt, some are Pluto-size, all are Pluto-like, and most havemoons too. No way around it: Pluto belongs with them more than with the gasgiants or inner Sol-bathed landscapes.This sort of planetary reclassification is not unprecedented. The largestasteroid, Ceres, was originally heralded as a planet (1801) insofar as ittraveled in the previously empty slot between Mars and Jupiter in keeping witheighteenth-century astronomer Johann Elert Bode’s proposed algebraic spacing ofthe Solar System. Like Pluto, Ceres was spotted when astronomers worldwide weresearching for a body in Bode’s predicted orbit; that is, for a missingtrans-Martian, sub-Jovian world. Yet by 1851 when the number of Cererian“planets” had ballooned to twenty-three with Vesta, Pallas, Hygieia, Juno, andcrew, the entire cluster was reclassified individually as asteroids. Theseplanetoids, a better name for them, filled the trans-Martian gap, either theprimordia of a stillborn world prevented by King Jupiter from jelling in itsvicinity or the debris of a Krypton-like cataclysmic explosion.For the record Pluto lasted in the planetary lodge (1930 to 2006) twenty-sixyears longer than Ceres and is also, while we’re at it, ten times more massivethan the largest asteroid.Pluto’s formal trial began early in 2006 in Prague when the IAU defined a planetas “a celestial body that is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass toassume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and has cleared theneighborhood around its orbit.” Objects fulfilling only the first criterionbecame known as SSSBs (Small Solar System Bodies); objects (like Pluto)fulfilling only the first two were dubbed dwarf planets.This dictate was modified on August 16, 2006 to read: “A planet is a celestialbody that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid bodyforces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium, and (b) is in orbit arounda star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet.”The “improved” definition was quickly revoked, as it would have slid Ceres,Charon, and at least one other Kuiper Belt Object (Eris) into the planetarycategory—Charon as sharing a double-planet slot with Pluto around a jointbarycenter (common center of gravity) rather than in explicit orbit like asatellite. In fact, the planet-moon distinction is relative, for an inevitableshift in the Earth-Luna barycenter will bring it into the definition’sdouble-planet range and make Earth’s Moon a planet too (and the Earth a memberof a double-planetary system). Even though this will not happen for millennia,the fact that it will was considered untenable by astronomers: the Moon is notand cannot be a planet—it would be too weird.The IAU’s main goal at the time was to exclude from consideration planet-nearsatellites, far Kuiper Belt Objects, bodies smaller than the Solar System’slargest satellites, extra-solar planets (soon to be plucked in legion fromaround other stars), and rogue planetary bodies floating between stars.A final classification of planethood was passed on August 24, 2006, underResolution 5A of the 26th General Assembly. It read:The IAU … resolves that planets and other bodies, except satellites, in theSolar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:(1) A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) hassufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that itassumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared theneighborhood around its orbit. The eight planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth,Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.(2) A “dwarf planet” is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun,(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces sothat it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has notcleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. An IAUprocess will be established to assign borderline objects to the dwarf planet orto another category.(3) All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred tocollectively as Small Solar System Bodies. These currently include most of theSolar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and othersmall bodies.The IAU further resolves: Pluto is a “dwarf planet” by the above definition andis recognized as the prototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects.End of the topic for them, but not end of discussion elsewhere.In truth, this is a meaningless dispute among nomenclaturists, extraneous to theheavens themselves—Pluto knows what it is.Down here on Earth, it is fair to concede that Pluto may no longer be a planetastronomically, but culturally and historically it is a planet—a full-fledgedmember of the Solar Senate and the last classical, thermodynamically molded orbto be invited into its convocation.At an early phase I had thought to develop this project in collaboration withNASA. I imagined that the Southwest Institute might actually encourage publicityand general esprit, to celebrate its triumph as well as make New Horizons a bitmore of an impromptu cultural fête than a managed scientific experiment. Afterinitial enthusiasm, an upbeat phone chat with one of Dr. Stern’s assistants, anda few days prior to our scheduled follow-up, I received a terse email: “NASAdeclines participation in this project.”Whatever the reason, I took it as a combination of no imagination and notolerance for a funkier universe than their own—no gumption or sense of humoreither. But then no one has much of a sense of humor these days—neitherfundamentalist scientists nor their fundamentalist foes.It was naïve of me to expect that space scientists would accept poets,metaphysicians, and astrologers as bedfellows, especially at a time of budgetaryscrutiny, political constraints on scientific research, and Tea Party qua FoxNetwork rubes looking for Benghazi-style gotchas to sling at egghead marks.Folks within the scientific cabal don’t tend to permit cultural imperatives thatbreak with their own ontology and belief systems anyway. Institutionally theyhave wrenched and pasteurized a laical cosmos out of the incomprehensiblecomplexity, vastness, and majesty of Creation, ignoring (as well) its reflectionin Psyche and the deeper realm of All That Is. They have likewise excludedmeanings, ethics, values, and consciousness from their authorized reality,consigning them instead to a ghostlike epiphenomenal realm.Fair enough—that’s science’s playing field, and no one wants to muddy aglittering hydrogen cosmos with its extraordinary output in the physical plane.But the reason that astrophysicists can’t get to the bottom of the wholeaffair—or through their subatomic particles, quarks, superstrings, amplituhedra,and related tropes to what runs the show from underneath, except for anadventitious Big Bang—is that the reality of the universe is far toomultidimensional for their instruments, or even their neurons, to crack.Most scientists also assume that, despite transient ideological and politicalhurdles, everything is going their way and in the long run they’re on thewinning team. Rarely examining the larger picture, the ontological background oftheir own paradigms and algebraic structures, or the liturgical materialism ofthe carpet they have rolled over the cosmos, they ex officio condonemacro-ecological pathologies that their interventions sow across the biosphere.Unexamined technocracy plays a leading role in Earth’s present crisis—and thatincludes rigidly narrow views of space, time, and matter. If life forms areinherently machines subject to terminal dissection, if nature is a resource tobe mined and manufactured for ephemeral use, then the threads that swathe theEarth as a living planet begin to unravel.In the absence of a critical counterview, hyper-rational scientism defines ouruniverse and species plan, which means as well the inability of the experimenterto get his or her ass out of the experiment, let alone track its ripples acrosssubtle biochemical systems, let alone into subtle bodies. All creatures on Earthsuffer the imposition of unrepentant materialism on their support systems andcritical habitats. This is a primo Pluto/Persephone dilemma.Of course in their unspoken thoughts scientists know (or intuit) that they arechewing on a mere rind of planets and stars. Their guileless curiosity,wonderment, and awe once drove their career choice and devotion to a deep truthmeditation, even if their cabal permits only quotidian recognition of it.So, despite science’s best efforts, astronomy has been inextricably tinged bycultural and aesthetic artifacts. On that basis this anthology is an antidote tosanitized astrophysical memes. Our Pluto is meant to stir far-flung imaginingsof not just the late classical planet (or first dwarf planet) but to pointsymbolically and subconsciously toward hidden and transcendental Plutonianthemes, to “new horizons” in alternative technology, cosmology, and ecologicaland economic awareness. If Pluto can be redefined, so can energy, so can money,so can value and meaning, for mythologically and etymologically the god whoseoracle is at “Pluto” happens to be the source and derivation of all wealth,material, and valuation—of materialism itself—as well as the mechanism of anyextant trove’s reversal and negation. We stand to be taught a lesson by Pluto—byany planet—but Pluto’s exercise is particularly paradigm shattering.I believe finally that the cultural and symbolic effects of planetaryexploration are unavoidable. Plus any expression of public enthusiasm for theplanets and stars, however misguided it may seem from a scientistic standpoint,in the long run inspires more than stymies celestial inquiry.In fact, expending resources on Pluto, likely a common Kuiper rock, makes farmore astrological than astronomical sense, which may be unconsciously what droveNew Horizons in the first place and just as unconsciously persuaded bureaucratsto fund it: you can’t underestimate a zodiac armed with synchronicity factors.Pluto the mytheme is a far more active and powerful agent (by comparison to amere dwarf planet) than realists are able to heel. From a purely astronomicalstandpoint, it sounds like (and resonates as) a higher roller than it is, infact to the degree that it fools even scientists and politicians. Pluto walksthe halls of NASA and Congress with street cred and glam, just as much of aplayuh, diva, and muckety-muck as Uranus, Mercury, and Saturn.If it were not for these cultural and archetypal attributes on an unconsciouslevel, a rationale for New Horizons would have been hard to construct on aconscious level. If all that was at stake was run-of-the-mill exogeology, whybother? Why valorize Pluto 134340? Why not just go after a nearer asteroid orcentaur—less hassle, less travel time, less gas. But meta-Pluto has compiledsuch an impressive nonscientific resumé that it has taken on its own ineffablepop cachet. That is what makes it seem astronomically more significant than itprobably is.In summarizing the contents of this anthology, I will offer oversight whilereferencing aspects of contributions (though I will not name every instancedcontributor).Although it makes parochial sense to distinguish astrological and mythologicalthemes from astronomical ones, and to segregate either from vernacularadaptations, these threads (as noted) tend to converge, conflate, andimbricate—unconsciously as well as intentionally, both in the universe and inour texts. Pluto’s astrological and mythological characteristics are virtuallyinseparable from each other and also, remarkably, from Plutonian astrophysics;they inform one another on psychological, symbolic, psychic, and totemic levels.Though Pluto may be a small, insignificant planet, not even a full planetarybody, it is a wide, deep archetype as well as a meta-planetary hyperobject,blending natural and cultural parameters in a tesseract beyond humandeconstructability.Yes, that is another bit of creative hyperbole on my part, but it is the reasonthat Timothy Morton occupies a key slot in this book. The Plutonianplaceholder—the array of parameters and concepts that have emerged from thesingular planetoid—have accorded it its special status in the ground of humanexperience. Morton characterizes the bigger picture as spanning “a geologicaltime (vast, almost unthinkable), juxtaposed … with very specific immediatethings—1784, 2001, 1943, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, plutonium”4—the eponym notirrelevant (plus hyperobjectivity is a fathomless series: global warming,Styrofoam, money, dark matter, torture, McWorld, Jihad, etc.). As culturalrubrics interact with natural objects, both thermodynamically and symbolically,their outcomes spread through space and time in weird, indecipherableways—storms of multivariate probability waves and their distributions ripplingthrough further transduction fields and their interference patterns.Morton hypothesizes as well under the epigraph of Percy Shelley’s “… awfulshadow of some unseen power.”5 No matter how many operations, interrogations,digital scans, and deconstructions we perform on Pluto, some aspect of itremains on high: supernal and indecipherable: “as summer winds that creep fromflower to flower; / Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower.”6 Itis as tantalizing as it is ineffable and unattainable.Hyperobjects are “entities that are massively distributed in time and space, atleast relative to human scales.… They are viscous, molten, nonlocal, phased, andinter-objective.… They appear in the human world as products of our thinkingthrough the ecological crisis we have entered.… [T]his is the moment at whichmassive nonhuman, nonsentient entities make decisive contact with humans, endingvarious human concepts such as world, horizon, nature, and even environment. Artin the time of hyperobjects isn’t simply art about hyperobjects but art thatseeks to evoke hyperobjectivity in its very form.…”7Many of Morton’s exemplifications apply to the Plutonian sphere; if not theconcrete astronomical body, the combination natural-cultural object andPlutonian archetype:One, Viscosity: The more we know about hyperobjects, the more we find that weare glued to them. Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matterhow hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironicdistance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, themore glued to the hyperobject it becomes. We find ourselves unable to achieveepistemological escape velocity from their ontological density, just as we werebeginning to enjoy our ironic free play. No fair!Two, Molten Temporality, e.g., Salvador Dali’s paintings of melting clocks: Anymassive object distorts space-time. Many hyperobjects really are massive enoughto do this for real with visible effects as in the case of Planet Earth itself.…Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that space-time is fixed,concrete, and consistent. There is no such thing as a rigid body extended intime and space for this reason. And for every object, there is a radicallyunknowable space and time because the speed of light sets limits on what objectscan apprehend. Hyperobjects end the idea of absolute infinite time and space asneutral containers.Three, Nonlocality: Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space tothe extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular localmanifestation.… Phenomena such as rain … become a local manifestation ofnonlocal objects. Thus hyperobjects play a mean trick; they invert what is realand what is only appearance.… The wet stuff falling on my head is less real thanthe global warming of which it’s a manifestation.… Likewise, objects don’t feelglobal warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage inspecific places.Four, Phasing: Hyperobjects occupy a higher dimensional phase-space than otherentities can normally perceive …, which is why they are partly invisible to us3D humans. They seem to come and go like seasons; yet really they continue tounfold elsewhere than where we look.Five, Inter-Objectivity: Hyperobjects are shared by numerous entities ina … vast nonlocal configuration space … of entangling ecologicalinterconnectedness … that I call the “mesh.…” Hyperobjects are formed byrelations between more than one object; consequently, objects are only able toperceive to the imprint, or “footprint,” of a hyperobject upon other objects,revealed as information.8It is interesting to note how many of these characteristics apply to scientificand science-fiction speculation about the planet Pluto, to its variousastrological and mythological semblances, or to an array of Plutonian proxies.The ninth planet is an object of fascination and controversy because it isintrinsically a hyperobject too—a sinkhole of paradoxes and prophecies.Pluto’s depth and hyperobjectivity jell under the precise terms of the planet’sexile from Earth—from terrestrial compasses, biases, and criteria. Because Plutois far from anywhere, opposite characteristics coexist in a single eerie object.Bring it closer to “somewhere”—anywhere—and its contradictions resolve and showrecognizable features accordingly. But Pluto cannot be dragged nearer to Earthby anything short of Type III alien extradition or cosmic catastrophe, so itmaintains its improbable nature and remove.“Lord of the limits and queen of the edge,” Pluto wanders along the borderbetween the old Solar System and the new Kuiper-Oort-extended System, as well asalong the symbolic (if not thermodynamic) heliopause between the Solar Systemand the rest of the universe, that is, between the comprehensible and theincomprehensible, the domestic and the alien, between human meanings and themystery of existence.At its distance, a Homo erectus glyph delivers identical semiology to a Homosapiens cyclotron, and the hoot of an owl is the chant of a monk. From Pluto wecan’t separate Einstein’s equations from Townes van Zandt’s lyrics or KimKardashian’s bare frontal, or any of them from the Bhagavada Gita or theepistles of al-Qaeda and John Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale.” You can’t tell WesAnderson from Vanity Fair or a trope from a tropism. It’s all Earth garbage,Earth static, Earth synapses and logic strings, intraterrestrial output,negative-capability source mode.Since the 1930s Pluto has been (semi-officially) Earth’s “nearest farawayplace.”Objectively Pluto presents aboriginal rock, frozen nitrogen, icy climatologyapproaching the alchemy of absolute zero, abode perhaps of weird life of somesort (in the unlikely instance that its core harbors seismically heatedcarbon-rich liquids or its surface has been “colonized” from beyond the SolarSystem). Synchronistically these also reflect Pluto’s role as guardian of theUnderworld and skipper of the convoy-barge between life and death.A “tough-love planetary swarm of moonlets,” “dark orphan,” “lonely lord … / inchthonic darkness / [keeping] his sad, abducted bride,” Pluto is a dispatcher of“chilly questions sent out into the galaxy / to travel, perhaps endlessly, / atthe speed of light.” (See poets in these pages for the sources of quoted lines).Pluto long ago emerged from a bottomless cosmic theogony as Robert Kelly’s“Invisible God who ruled / the shadowy land where the dead / in their terribleparadox were / understood to live” The discovery of Pluto in planetary formawakened its Eleusinian dormancy and tied the orb to an emerging meaning-set inthe zodiac, as Pluto took the spot reserved for it by Uranus and Neptune andtheir Dionysian predecessors.Pluto’s mythological and astrological attributes conjure the bleak side ofShelley’s “awful shadow”: emptiness, loss, desolation, loneliness, grief,despair, eternal darkness, hopelessness, unconsciousness, cyclonic downdraft,involuntary descent, termless incarceration, loss of ground, trauma, panic,fear, cataclysm, vicissitude, addiction, megalomania, ideological monolith,security state, rape, death of God, loss of soul, leakage of plutonium-238 intothe biosphere, warlordism, flash mobs, irregular armies, death terror—the“shadow at the bottom of the world” or, in the words of Robert Kelly, “thedarkness that does not precede the dawn but the birth of a radical new order ofthings.”9Yet Pluto’s cardinal motifs, equally and conversely, propagate transformation,transcendence, revelation, resurrection, rejuvenation, metamorphosis, heroism,wealth, footing in groundlessness, crucible, intelligible teleology,metadimensionality, numinosity, essence of all beingness, courage, and the basisfor moral judgment—the enantiodromic Dreamtime.In its positive jurisdiction Pluto incubates the pre-Olympian Eleusinian ritesas well as timeless antecedents in which Persephone and Demeter perform asoperants and agents. These entail, at different tiers, a recovery of the emberof spring from the demise of winter, of the luminosity and situatedness ofrebirth from the extinction and amnesia of death—by proxy, the revolt of older,wiser Minoan gods against the tyranny of Zeus and his Olympian entourage: the“eventual integration of anything transcendent.”10 The message of the EleusianMysteries and Plutonian latency in Western thought (which goes back well beforePersia and Greece, so certainly precedes the discovery of a stray dwarf) is thatonly by death is resurrection possible; only by submitting to the excruciatinggauntlet of dismemberment can one be reborn, can the Soul transcend the body.This transmission of secrets is obscurely petitioned in later ceremonies andinitiations like the Rite of Vigil, the Golden Dawn, Woodstock, and Burning Man.It is evoked subliminally and sown throughout the noosphere by New Horizons.When emanating negatively on Earth, Pluto vamps as Hitler, Hiroshima,apocalypse, Mad Max, Boko Haram, the Mexican Zetas, and xenophobia (Pluto theultimate stranger). Its baleful domain spawns concentration camps, genocides andapartheids, the Hutu interahamwe, and ISIS’s ravaging pseudo-caliphate—allmyrmidons of the Plutonian sphinx: William Butler Yeats’s self-arising “shapewith … a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun.”11When manifesting positively, Pluto appears as a savior and saint as well as thebaseline pivot of another reality, an entirely different universe beyond matteryet accessible to psyche: those are its “infinite directions of inexplicablewonder.”Yet remember the greater paradox, Pluto’s Klein-bottle-like topology: absolutepositive and absolute negative aspects overlap. Pluto is the European aspect ofShiva, switching robes at the Western phase of the Indo-European continuum. AsShiva/Hades, he is horrific, the most repellent and bloodiest demon of the lot;his blue-throated, snake-garlanded, ash-smeared cynosure, remorseless andimpliable, heralds the futility and fate of all material existence, yet somehowextends compassion and hope beyond ordinary purlieus. Shiva is an essentialhealer and therapist without regard for temporal life and death. S/he carriesthe message, astonishing when you get right down to what it really says, thatdeath is not death but the opening to an immortality that transcends mortalityitself, that dissolves all dialectics and dichotomies.The psalm that haunts Shelley’s lines is Plutonian in origin: that summer windsconceal and cue an older, more serious breeze, a flow between portals ofbeinghood; that starlight on clouds betokens a universe in which all Souls andcreatures are interdependent and all planets and planetoids bear coequal mass.Pluto’s Underworld is finally a birth chamber. Pluto is also a trickster, aclown, a psychopomp like Coyote in indigenous California and the Great Basin—inother cultures, Raven, Mockingbird, Guinea Pig, Fox, Hyena, Badger, Bee,Spider—which means that s/he creates as she destroys, deceives whileenlightening, plays pranks and drops misdirects and kōans even as she trains andeducates. She dupes shamans as adroitly as she baffles laypersons.Psyche is always dealing with its own contradictory Plutonian nature, respondingto a message as paradoxical as itself. According to astrologer Jeff Green:Pluto correlates to the Soul and evolution.… [T]he Soul is an immutableconsciousness that has its own individuality or identity that remains intactfrom life to life. In each lifetime, of course, the Soul manifests a personalitythat has an objective consciousness and unconsciousness. Saturn defines theboundaries of our subjective consciousness—that of which we are consciouslyaware. Uranus represents the individualized unconscious, Neptune the collectiveunconscious, and Pluto the Soul itself.…Pluto is a binary planetary system. Pluto’s moon, Charon, is actually a planetin its own right. Charon is half the size of Pluto itself, and one twentieth thedistance from Pluto as compared to the distance of the Moon from the Earth. Theprinciple of dual coexisting desires seems to be reflected in this planetarysymbology.12The fundamental dual nature of Pluto-Charon expresses the original tensionbetween the Soul’s desire to remain attached to an impeccable source in anuminous realm—disembodied, enlightened, in a state of eternal epiphany andpeace—and its commensurate urge to germinate, incarnate, wake up, gainexperience, rough-ride, engage its own true nature. The tension generated bythis antithesis explains, even justifies, Pluto’s indecencies and damage as wellas the most horrific and extreme Plutonian motifs. Pluto is everything andnothing, there and not there, innocent and guilty, latent and manifest, formedand unformable, seraph and abomination, where-the-buck-stops and incapable ofresponsibility. It changes identities as it approaches the impenetrable basis ofits own reality.Pluto’s hubris is humility itself.In this regard it is worth tracking a particularly keen exchange between twonoted astrologers, Mark Jones and Steven Forrest, in May 2011. They were riffingoff Jeff Green’s characterization of Pluto as essential “Soul presence.”Jones introduced the topic by relating the role of Pluto to the lunar south nodein a person’s chart: “The Pluto level of the past is the more unconsciousdynamic to me. I start there because it’s an unconscious context, like thedeepest security factor.… Pluto is where a soulful aspect, a deeper unconsciousaspect of a person has been fixated.…”Forrest gracefully accepted the notion of an inner Plutonian fixation but notedthat “in [Jeff’s] system Pluto represents the Soul.” The Soul is not only lockedonto Pluto; for all intents and purposes it is Pluto—that is, Pluto gatheringthe moss of negative default patterns from childhood and past lives and generalcravings, habits, and other emotional baggage.While acknowledging that he and Green share a philosophical DNA, Forrest went onto make a key distinction between their reads of Pluto: “To me, the Soul is amystery.” It cannot just be Pluto; it is represented by the entire chart withall its planets, signs, and houses; it also transcends the chart. So, he imposeda critical clarification: “Pluto is the wound in the Soul.” Then he offeredGreen’s comeback: “‘Under the patriarchy, all Souls are wounded.’”Forrest took that as less a rebuttal of his own astrosophical Pluto than adialectic, a grout melding his and Green’s “planets.” He put it this way: “Plutogives us the skills and the powers and the tools that we need to access thewound, and that process is so Soulful and so pertinent to the journey of theSoul that it is equated with the Soul.”13Here the matter rests: Pluto is not the Soul, but in this world its action is sodeep, so traumatic, so remedial, that its effigy both masks and mirrors theSoul, including the Soul’s view of its own situation in us. In other words, wecould do worse than to track Pluto as a proxy for the Soul—and astrologerseagerly adopt the matrix.The core of the Plutonian initiation is that it gets to the bottom of things anyway it can, which means that the Soul will always express its core nature. Inthe words of another astrologer, Ellias Lonsdale: “Earth is Pluto, and Pluto isEarth. Earth is the depth of Pluto, and Pluto is the mystery of Earth.”Pluto alone dares to break with paradise, with latency—an archetypally perennialact that leads to much subsequent transgression and tragedy. Once cut loose fromthe Pure Land Buddha-fields with their superheroes, avatars, divinities,exquisite flowers and fruits, ambrosias, and wish-granting trees on whichluminous birds glide to rest, etc., the Soul must create an alternate existencein the rough territory of potential and dormant cosmoses. The originary vestalrealm surpassed all imagination of beauty but was not resolved or final or onlyreal. Its gods were not gods, its flowers not flowers, its birds not birds, atleast in the usual sense. Enter Pluto to rake karma and clear matters up.The Soul must deal with its innate plight, i.e., its curiosity regarding its ownnature, views that engender (and embody) whole universes under quantum statesand monkey minds, that molt Pluto into its aliases. Lamentably that meansconflict, war, atrocities, havoc, mayhem, ingenious instruments of torture, forthe Soul’s got to know, it’s got to know everything about itself and itschattel; that’s the only way back, the only reliable course to liberation out ofsamsara and resolution of harrowing extrinsic pain—either to experience itdirectly as victim/martyr or to deliver it as perpetrator.Plutonian duality lies at the heart of the ancient Persephone myth, the codawhereby Jung and his archetypally oriented successors derived an essentialtransformation: a renewal by metamorphosis in a situation where initially thereappears to be only trespass and violation.While gathering flowers with a sprightly clique from the three thousandOceanids, Persephone snatched up an especially beautiful and radianthyper-petalled thing. By uprooting it, she unintentionally opened a cleft, anabyssal chasm to the Plutonian Netherness— in Jungian terms the unconsciousfoundation of consciousness itself. From there she was forcibly pulled down intoa vacuum where she was palpably raped by an invisible god form, a being shecould not see. As the force took on quasi-human shape, it compelled her to marryhim and relocate to his realm.Hades (Pluto) had been given prior permission by Zeus (Jupiter) to abductPersephone because her imperious mother, Demeter (Ceres), goddess of fertilityand vegetation, had kept her daughter hidden and unavailable to the gods, mostof whom had been smitten by her beauty and charm. Hermes and Apollo, inparticular, were beguiled but thwarted from wooing Persephone by Demeter. So,instead, the over-chaperoned girl ended up with the ugly, dark Plutonian shadow.But Pluto is not just a god or king of the Underworld; he is the astral plane,the fourth dimension, what Rob Brezsny calls “the other real world.” Pluto isnot an abductor but an abyss of pure latency. Likewise in Jungian terms theflower is not just a flower but an opening into her own psyche. That the bloomwas a narcissus conflates the myth of Persephone with the archetype ofNarcissus, the beautiful son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope,who became so fixated by the image of his own portrait in a pool that he did notrecognize that he was staring at himself (see Nathan Schwartz-Salant’s book onnarcissistic character disorders, cited in the endnotes).The loss of her daughter caused Demeter to grieve to such a degree that springfailed to return to the Earth that year, and in ensuing decades. Nothing grew—aperilous state of affairs even for gods insulated on Olympus. After Helios, theSun, revealed Persephone’s location to her mother, Demeter pleaded withJupiter/Zeus for her release. He responded by allowing the girl, at least inprinciple, to surface. However, Hades, fully wed and in possession of his prize,was not so easy to juke or rein in. While by the law of the gods he had to obeya command from Zeus, he first enticed Persephone, who was abstaining from foodduring her ordeal, to swallow several—some say three, others four—pomegranateseeds. Once she had consumed food in the Underworld, she was compelled to dwellthere henceforth, at least for part of the calendric cycle, Zeus’s sanctionnotwithstanding—half the year in some versions, a third in others—for the powerof the archetype trumps the power of the gods and prevails over our ownmanipulations, stratagems, and implicit greed too. Persephone’s sentence belowbecomes winter in the world above, a necessary Plutonian cleansing of nature, arebirth from bared roots and branches to new luxuriant seeds and sprouts.In older, possibly Minoan versions, Demeter traveled on earth in peasantdisguise during her period of mourning and, after helping to raise a royal childincognito, revealed her illuminated and immortal self to the stunned court, thenordered a temple to be built in her name and taught the Eleusinian mysteriesthere.At every level, this story is a parable of the psychic forces unleashed byPluto. The myth is just as cogent in an age when the gods have become starkmachineries, diseases, and remote planets that vacated Olympus for the zodiac,e.g., far more obscure but equally sovereign sites from which to rule mankind.The Rape of Persephone is only secondarily and superficially a patriarchalaccount of plunder and kidnapping. While on the surface an innocent maiden isviolated by a self-aggrandizing and antipathetic fiend, that is not the wholestory. Pluto/Persephone is a dyad in which each polarity potentiates and makespossible the other. Hades (Pluto) is, according to Rob Brezsny, “a deep, hiddenforce that manifests throughout the universe on different worlds in differenttimes and is always seminal. You can’t have Pluto without Persephone, but youalso can’t have Persephone unless Pluto awaits her.”In that sense Pluto’s power and gift is “a forced initiation which appears tocome out of nowhere but changes our lives forever. It is where we are taken overby forces we never believed we were going to get involved with.” Pluto’scontribution is contravention and rupture; he forces us to go deeper anddifferent. He requires that of us because that’s ultimately what and where weare. “If we deny, banish, and repress all the soul’s good stuff,” Brezsnycontinues, “the only way it can reach us is through rape and abduction. As itscycle of violence and prurience increases, Pluto imposes a daily punishment,which is not actually a punishment but a necessity, a gift in disguise. The soulwill not allow us to forget it, even if it has to express itself by dark acts ofrequital.”As New Horizons approaches Pluto, we see the startlingly sudden appearance onEarth of the planet’s shadow and mange, a vast throwback Islamic caliphate, itstroops donning the black robes of Mordor and behaving like orcs as explicitlyand blithely as if Hollywood had overwritten their script, typecast theiractors, and staged their atrocities as a sequel to Friday the 13th and The TexasChainsaw Massacre—except that these are scaldingly real deeds from such a nakedrealm of horror that First Worlders cannot grasp them or their implications,even though Hollywood’s own reality show is what is being parodied, hideously.ISIS is plutonium-238 come of age and incarnate. That is why it shatters its ownimagery. The sword drawn anew under Pluto is the Sword Itself.Omar Al-Baghdadi’s self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or among theinfidels, al-Daesh (“the Crushers”), imitates the slasher-and-gore genre despiteitself (that is, despite its mock Sharia chastity); then the media picks up onthe performance and makes it seem like what is actually happening. That isbecause the phenomenon has a kernel that is not only imagistically Plutonian butcontinues to issue subliminal Plutonian commands: life imitating art, artimitating life. ISIS understands that, in a Facebook/Twitter era, the displayaspect of their public massacres imposes absolute sound and absolute silence,ripples of which go both forward and backward in time. Fringes dominate thecenter, and folks find themselves playing characters who have forgotten who theyare. It’s we who go retrograde, not Pluto. Pluto simply grinds its aboriginalrelentless scythe.For such a ragtag, psychopathic militia, Isis is an oddly unfitting name anyway,except under Pluto. For otherwise, she is the sweetest, most nurturing andobliging goddess in the proto-Egyptian pantheon. The Daily Spell, an onlinemagazine of “pagan news and views since 1998” offered this “daily dose ofmagical thought” in September 2014):ISIS is not a Terrorist Group in the Middle EastISIS is the Holy Goddess of Love and PeaceDo NOT use the Goddess’ Name in Vain!ISIS symbolically designates a scorched Earth in global crisis. That it couldarise so quickly and unexpectedly, spread so far so fast, and sear such crueltyand sadism so deeply into the human psyche—beheadings, live burials of families,and mass recreational executions—is a reflection of the Plutonian complex andits instantaneity of penetration. Before anyone can react, there it is.No one even knows the real nationality of ISIS (or ISIL if you substitute“Levant” for “Syria”); it is Iraqi and Sunni but also Chechen, Somalian,Tunisian, Taliban, Pakistani, British, French, German, Canadian, American,Australian. It is a metastasizing street mob of transnational dislocated youth,Islamic jihadists by name but neither Islamic nor involved in jihad; they arereally the untagged forces of a disturbed planet seeking a banner and brandunder which to coil, unite, and strike back: an aggregate cobra.It should be no surprise that the United States, Russia, Iran, Israel, and Chinaare equal-opportunity targets of ISIS, hence back-channel allies against itwithout tacit agreement or openly combining forces.Pluto sets all against itself and itself against all. Its goal is absolute andtransmutational; it does what it has to in order to achieve it. It must becomeISIS in order to stand against ISIS; it must ravage in order to give birth evenas it must adopt the anti-goddess shape of Isis to stand against the godlesstransnational state. Under Pluto, after all, it is not going to be Tibetan monksleading the way out of pandemic globalism. The serum is going to be a gangstraight out of Pluto, live. As Robert Phoenix posts on Facebook:Isis is the Mother Of The New Age. Are her progeny Pluto in Scorpio and doesthat explain the almost demonic savagery they are capable of? In essence, isISIS more than just terrorizing jihadists? Are they the satanically possessedfoot soldiers of Ahriman?It is not easy for the motley Western alliance to defeat the alliance of anastrological conjunction with an ontological hyperobject, for any attack on it,especially by mere aerial bombing, recoils and releases more of its coresymbols, sigils, seeds, and devotees.Some astrologers propose that as Pluto passes next through Capricorn and repeatsaspects of the United States’s founding 248 years ago in 1776, it will triggerthe beginning of the breakup and coming apart of those same “united states” in2022–2024—a complete Plutonian cycle. Of course, that is the ultimate goal ofthe Islamic militants too.The modern world is full of Persephone-like abductions, from Boko Haram’srounding up whole schools of Nigerian girls and transporting them to aPluto-like purgatory, to forced marriages of prepubescent children in Pakistanand Afghanistan, to ISIS’s raping of captives and selling them into slavery, tothe disappearance of girls and young women from the streets of Juarez.The myth is imposed again and again, sterilely, against the will of Zeus,against the pleas of Demeter, against the Geneva Accords, against the UnitedNations, against any norms of social justice or internationally accepted taboos.Why? And how do we break the compulsion of negative violative Pluto and enlistpositive Pluto’s redemption?The answer lies in Pluto’s unexcavated and dual nature.The planet/god reigns simultaneously over timelessness and time, 248 years pluschange per terrestrial-calendar orbit.For eleven Earth years Cleveland bus-driver Ariel Castro held three kidnappedwomen captive, much of that time in chains, while sexually molesting them at hiswhim. Materializing in the camouflage of a suave caring uncle, he abducted themby offering them rides to their destinations, a ruse whereby a modernized Plutosurfaces to woo new victims—“Little Red Riding Hood” the cautionary tale here.We can only guess what flowers distracted them from necessary vigilance, forMadison Avenue and the capitalist desire industry litter Earth’s landscape withnarcissi.Nine years prior to being caught, Castro wrote a private memo in which headmitted to being a “sexual predator” and pitifully called out for help.Afterwards he went on molesting those women for approximately 4,730,400additional minutes. During any of them, he could have stopped on a dime, wokenhimself up, and pondered, “I have this thoughtform, and it is powerful, and I amacting on it, but it is not who I actually am. I am not imprisoned by it. It isnot even my own energy. Stop, Ariel, stop.”But that’s how powerful, enduring, and all-encompassing Pluto is. It blots outthe stars and sunlight; it turns the universe outside in; it dissolves anyforeground in its background mirage. Pluto is not only the compulsion but themyth that binds people to it, that deludes or lulls a person into thinking thatit is consummate reality and desire and, without it, he will lose his identity,his core, his gender, and drift in nothingness. It was that imperative thatdelivered Persephone to Hades in Minoan days, and likely throughout theinterminable Stone Ages back to the gods who met humans at the threshold ofconsciousness itself—that continues to raise a dark mountebank to incarcerateher under its shadow. The fear of the terror of emptiness meets the fear of aprior, even more terrible trauma and vacuity.Castro never progressed through Pluto/Persephone redemption; he held fast to aCharon-the-boatman skeleton in Pluto’s frozen realm, forgoing the rites ofspring and Eleusinian Mysteries, unaware of the exaltation of release fromnegative Pluto’s grip, the exquisiteness of pleasure that comes with liberationfrom an ordeal of pleasure-less lust. Then he committed suicide in his prisoncell rather than dwell among his own devastating thoughtforms.Despite appearances, Pluto is actually trying to manifest his opposite: If youdon’t break my compulsion, you will remain in my tidal lock like any orb undergravity, until some other planet comes along and knocks you out.How drear are Pluto’s ongoing fixations?Mexican cartels specialize in public beheadings too, also live removal of scalpsand faces, and castrations, mirrors held up to their bound victims, their ownbody parts shoved down their throats. Hitmen and enforcers take it as far astheir imaginations can—why not, in their handpicked profession of torture anddeath. But they finally run into the brick wall of materialization itself—thatdeath by Pluto is also resurrection by Pluto, that shamanic extortion isshamanic initiation, that what goes around comes around, karmically. They areholding a mirror to their own faces, in Plutonian time.A family man and contractor in Tampa, Florida, bamboozled female tourists ontohis boat, then one by one raped, tied them up, and threw them overboard alive. Aself-denying serial killer on the loose, he was sleuthed down via a publicbillboard of his handwriting sample (a drama depicted on the television showForensic Files).How do guys like that think that they can conceal themselves and their actionsfrom God? From Psyche? From Pluto in his dual watch? Do they really think theycan hide from the universe and get off scot-free?In another Forensic Files episode a Lubbock rapist strangled his female victims,then calmly slid their bodies into plastic bags and disposed of them indumpsters. Once again Pluto is in imbalance, negative Pluto turning the screws.Sad to say, none of these acts, however menial and vile, can arise or operate inisolation, without countless other energies and forms throughout the universematching them. The zodiac must stay in balance, as big and complex a girth oflight and shadow as it is, as patient and wide-ranging an ontology.Everything Pluto manifests it wrests while standing against itself; everythingthat Persephone’s abduction brings to the Underworld recoils in the Upperworldas something redemptive. When the most depraved crimes and loathsometransgressions hit Pluto, they reverse, convert, and transmogrify. They have to,for there is no place else to go.Pluto is the wound in the Soul, all right, and these days it is hard to seeanything but.A California man murders his best friend’s wife and son in order to kidnap hisdaughter for whom he has an infatuation. “Where have you gone, James DiMaggio,”indeed?“I haven’t gone anywhere,” Joe snapped with baffled irritation. He had no termsfor recognizing the transformation of the Yankee Clipper into Mr. Coffee.As for James Lee DiMag, what he accomplished was getting himself turned into adead star floating in some nameless space, delivering blind and blank energythat continues to need resolution, that is still seeking a stasis and tippingpoint into something livable. He is at Pluto ultra, Pluto embodied in a Noh playlarger than worlds.The ISIS ravaging of Syria and Iraq, the rampant slaughters of Shiites,Christians, Zoroastrians, Yezidis, and even noncomplying Sunnis; the rampagesand kidnappings of Boko Haram; the scourges of the narco-cartels; and JosephKony’s massacres and kidnappings under his brand of the “Army of God,” alongwith corporate abuses of animals and Earth itself are all Plutonian shadows,recoils through the human psyche of the sociopathic derangement, of souldeadness, of Pluto’s toil in the absence of Pluto. Until Pluto arrives to healit, a Mordor-like plague spreads, birthing dark kingdoms, war crimes, andantipathetic algorithms, for curiosity about our undisclosed nature trumps eventhe pleasure principle because none of these participants is having real fun.All their turmoil, baggage, and desperation roils archetypally under NASA’scovenant with pure mystery and an essentially undisclosed cosmos—and I don’tmean Plutonian body 134340.It takes more than a space mission and linear exposition to get at Pluto’sdeepening entry into our midst and influence on the Earth, for we are talkingabout a planet, a hyperobject, larger than Jupiter, swelling while metastasizinginside both the human and natural sphere. Frederick Ware, an American architectliving in France, came close to nailing it in an email to me in lieu of a formalcontribution to this anthology. In an exegesis and a dream he foreshadowedPlutonian mayhem:Well, Pluto = Hades (minus hermeneutical analyses). Maybe Pluto is a place whereone can get some perspective—Out of this World / Nagel’s View from Nowhere?Had a weird but Big dream this night.P O W E R F U L(yep. hope it’s “only” personal):The world’s mythical Ocean was in turmoil—i.e., something not seen in memory inthat mindspace. A wind of Big Planetary Death swelling to engulf humanity. Theoceanic energies were churning, swelling, running over Everything down below.…Travelling with friends—trying to flee—so to find high ground.I witnessed a Monster wave SWELLING.It towered above its tumultuous brethren.Narrative: said to my sidekick, “We gotta get to higher ground!!!” Yeah! (wokeup).Think there’s a (not so) hidden meaning with wars, pandemics, ecologicaldisasters just over the horizon? Or just passing stress as silly stupid humanityplods along seeking other refuge for their selfish genes …?You DID think of the mythic connections with Greek mythopoeic warnings!!??I respect but doubt primal instincts diffusing from the House of NASA.Consider that thermodynamical/info-game theoretical energies ANIMATE thespiritual parties in future Olympian temples!Pluto, as Hades, was master of the Greek endgame. As believer in buddhisticrecycling, one sees him as a “business man,” collecting alms for passage-coinbefore taking the boat trip into the bowels of Eternity! All is bardo.To my lights, key message here—stay @ home, take care of Oikos, home. point!Better to die extincted—noble or partly race—than survive in future gnostical“worlds,” stripped of Dignity, self-serving REPLICONS: Energy slaves.…Replicators—organic Lego bricks/Build the House of Hades.Moral of this cycle’s Story?Just wait for this Mayan cyclic passing … cyclic recycler, renewer of Hope.Believe in US, you, not the Them who pull the strings.Trying to flee is ULTIMATELY FUTILE!Serial killers, narcoterrorists, and hooded ISIS soldiers can’t be stopped andwon’t be stopped. Pluto won’t have it. Then Pluto will only have it.Pluto is the one planet with enough homeopathic heft, the single worldsynopsized concisely enough and from far enough away, to convert these and otherthoughtforms and release their victims. For the forces that join Ego to Selfalso pull Ego away from Self, to reveal the rugged reincarnational landscape ofthe human and cosmic enterprise.Yes, I know, the rest of us are riding in a presently immune convoy at a safedistance from the outer Solar System and Fourth World, in the upper percentileof the West. But, dudes, here in our privileged digs, we are not immune fromPluto. That is why we presumptuously keep telling the “bad” guys that theirPlutos can be transformed into amazing stuff, even in the name of Allah, evenwhile trafficking women and brewing whole dragons’ lairs of meth, even in theservice of fallen angels and avatars, even while mega-guarded in theirfortresses. That very Plutonian energy they are hoarding and bowing to,distorting and squandering, holds the key to mercy, divinity, and the actualprana of love.We rationalize that they are doing the best they can—they are making good use ofan impoverished birth in a poor land in a bad time. We have the freedom toabsolve them as well as our own guilt and vulnerability that dispose us toappease them, in our own projections, as if to make a safer, more prosperousworld for us all.We need to go deeper into Pluto in ourselves to scale our own terror andattraction to terror, our apostasy and faux probity against our own darkness.Even if the whole world were made of beings like us, even if everyone were likethe Dalai Lama, ISIS would still exist, wars would still occur. For everyone hasshape-changing Pluto in his or her chart; everyone is matching everyone else’sconsensus reality in the same zodiac.Pluto is not only the fact that apocalypse and epiphany are the identical energyat source; it is the precept that you can’t get to epiphany without apocalypseand that every act of devastation, every grief, is the crucible of someambrosial joy. This is a sullen, grim message, but it is the cosmos’s one beaconof hope written in the stars: “The Goddess suffers rape, for only in that waydoes she become transformed by her own mysteries.”14Pluto, whoever it finally (with us as its spokesperson), operates beyond its ownrecognizance and joyless repetition of sterile acts, for it alone has the powerto commute them, to deliver us from violence, from betrayal, from gluttony.It will take hundreds of thousands of years and many lifetimes to get it donePluto’s way, but the universe has at least that much time. That’s more or lesswhy it’s presently filled with galaxies and stars. The reason that Pluto existsis the reason that any of this exists. That was what Seth II was murmuring toour world.Pluto camouflages the universe from us, but that allows us to be who we are andlive our charts without knowing the outcome in advance. Pluto reveals theuniverse to us at the moment of transfiguration and Soul awakening. That is whythe most poignant and delicious emotions we feel are triggered by Pluto’spassage: it governs our demise and resurrection, the resolution of our tragedyand karma.Even Pluto the cat underwent a distinctive Plutonian metamorphosis:“It was a crisp and cold March morning when she had called our neighbor Ron tobring his .22 rifle and help put Pluto down. They stood in the driveway, withthe girls inside perhaps unaware of what was going to happen, and shot the blindold wretched cat.“The story goes that in a brilliant flash the air became crystal clear,pristine, still, and almost brittle. It was like the limpid clarity behind thisworld of appearances was revealed. In that moment they both felt an unexpectedsense of awe and simplicity and calm. They stood there in that transformed spaceand hugged each other and cried. In an instant Pluto was gone, and in therelease, something remarkable had been revealed.…“It has been many years since these incidences of Pluto’s life occurred, yet asI recall them now they bring back strong emotions. Especially remembering thetime I almost drowned him, sitting in the car together as we pondered his fateand our connection, it makes my heart open in deep ways, and I find the tearsjust pouring from my eyes.“Pluto was more than a cat or companion for those years. He was a glimpse of allof Life. A glimpse of the farther reaches, the extremes of what we all canexperience, that are both immediate and tangible, yet also beyond the visible.In the end it seems he was named perfectly.”15Named perfectly—the long and the short of it: the “awful shadow of some unseenpower … / like memory of music fled.…”Planet, dwarf planet, criminal, trickster, alien, outlier, banished god,invisible god, deviant lodge member, jihadist, Reiki master, Pluto turns theSolar System into what it is.Pluto’s prosperity is intangible and equivocal, bound in the etymology of itsname (Πλουτων, Ploútōn: giver of wealth), which lies at the root of its god formand authority. “Ploutos” is the most boundless form of affluence because it isgenerated and allotted value outside sectarian and secular measures as well asbeyond the sunny warmth and possessiveness of the ego. It is acquired from thedestruction of superficial bounty, transitional opulence and plenitude, whetherthat be after tragedy and personal death or from the obliteration of entireformer star systems into fresh hydrogen gas and dust.Pluto is made out of, is able to make itself out of, nothing again and again,from time immemorial and for time immemorial, in fact beyond the oceans of time.Pluto is the deepest manifest figurement of the Greek pantheon, the guardian ofthe most profound human and divine wisdom and truth-mystery (in fact, esotericknowledge is the root of Pluto’s older Mycenaean alias, Hades: Hāidēs; DoricΑιδας Aidas).The source of not just emeralds, rubies, diamonds, coal, gold, uranium, oil,etc.—things of the Earth—Pluto contains a far more submerged, priceless, andscarce treasure, the matrix of mineral nature itself, the basis of valuationfrom within planetary cores, under the cosmological ground, back to thosemolecular clouds of dust and gas, their divine formations and blessings, theirsubsequent attributes and emanations. Pluto encapsulates the cosmic conversionfrom gas to liquid to solid and back as well as its paraphysical mutations intoplasmas, ectoplasms, and other metaphysical states. These include the miracle oftransubstantiating inanimate matter into bacteria, proto-cells, and DNA, theninto grains and fruits and creatures. It ultimately governs the terraforming ofPluto itself.The secret crux of the New Horizons probe, the inexpressible, unacknowledgeablemotive behind such a Quixotian mission (in terms of our nation’s dwindlinginflated wealth) is an exploration of our own bare Plutonian nature. Thesatellite is headed into the human unconscious, into a mirror of us and ourglobal state, into blowback of the scientific hegemony and economic strangleholdon our future and the abandoned richness of our psyche from which new sciences,societies, and truths must someday come. The esoteric side of the New Horizonsmission is to reveal to us who we are, and it will do so in signature Plutonianfashion, not by explicit image bits, data units, surface measurements, or scantPlutonian facts (engaging though these be) but by seeding its own fact in ourhuman and cultural loam, by directly incubating our collective psyche and itstransformational archetypes.Perhaps that is why NASA’s subcontractors rejected my invitation to participatein this anthology. They wanted to avoid archetypal dispersal from Pluto itself,subliminally anyway—to remain ignorant of why they were making such a largeinvestment (financial and professional) in such an incidental piece of KuiperBelt real estate accidentally assigned planetary status because its path crossedthat of mysterious Planet X at a time when Clyde Tombaugh was looking intoGemini.Yet they cannot help being drawn into a Plutonian gyre whereby the hidden planetadumbrates the perceptible one, its shadows, rudiments, and clones inseminatingentire realms atop ephemeral placeholders. And that is the case whatever theyfind there.This anthology also incorporates science fiction along with scientificallyradical appearances of Pluto. Kim Stanley Robinson augurs these themes in hisepic trilogy (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars) that concludes with theterraforming of not only our neighboring planet but the entire Solar System, avision of a future far too akin to Philip K. Dick’s dystopias to be as utopian,or ironically utopian, as it sounds:The town Hippolyta spanned one of the big groove valleys that were common to allthe larger Uranian moons. Because the gravity was even more meager than thelight was dim, the town had been designed as a fully three-dimensional space,with railings and glide ropes and flying dumbbell waiters, cliffside balconiesand elevators, shoots and ladders, diving boards and trampolines, hangingrestaurants and plinth pavilions, all illuminated by white floating lampglobes.16This enticing travel blurb could be taken straight from Rick Steves’s Guide toPluto and the Outer Solar System.Pluto additionally functions as mathematical surd and hidden perturber; asstand-in for the “orbit” of Tyche, a missing suppositional gas giant in the OortCloud; as anomalous object; as alien encounter; as interstellar archetype, asdark-matter relic; as black-hole portal; as telekinetic thaumaturge; as ET base;as preserved-ruins and forbidden-archaeology windfall; as lynchpin in the “truehistory” of the Solar System; as landing platform for ET contact; as orbitalmessage that is more “Pluto code” than “Pluto planet”; as telepathic relaystation and interstellar Akashic library for meanings beyond the human operatingsystem or the conventional capacity of bionts.You’d better picture something out of the ordinary, weirder than crystal domesor celestial factories—not “mere” city-size spaceships, Pandoran dragons,unobtanium deposits, and humanoid robots either but changelings, shape-changers,poltergeists, cryptids, entities flickering in and out of materiality,rainbow-dimensional portals, qubit nanobots, amplituhedronal quantum-fieldinteractions masking meta-shamanic rituals and nonlocal psychic flying. It’sgoing to be the most extravagant Transdimensional Light and Magic Show ever.Meanwhile Pluto Coyote prances through rad sci-fi as an artificial body,telltale scrap, and priceless signature of planetary engineering—the fanaticalrearranging and remodeling of the size and spacing of the planets and moonsorbiting Sol in the original Solar System—by ETs with a very large budget, TypeIII blueprint, and ambitious utopian plan. Mars’s moons Deimos and Phobos havelikewise been implicated as artifacts of ET high technology, in fact almost fromthe instant of their discovery. This alien dossier includes structures in Mars’sCydonia region, craters on Luna, subterfuge asteroids, a chevron shape on theUranian moon Miranda, and now the Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet.The most extreme version of this trope is that Pluto is an abandonedrelativistic, inertialess-acceleration intergalactic transport machineincorporating the mean-motion-resonance of all its moons and the planetary bodyitself (merely the largest unit of swarm) into a hyperdimensional driveresembling something out of Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.Finally Pluto is a pellet of the incomprehensible that skirts the human sphere;thus, at every level and interpretation it may not deliver but it alwaysportends, bearing messages and masquerades from the universe at large and fromAll That Is, from beyond us in our present incarnate form.How those meanings are voiced by individual authors in this anthology matterslittle as to details. When you are describing the indescribable, you saywhatever you can. For instance, Richard Hoagland’s thesis and numerology—Pluto’s248-Earth-year orbit set as an intentional harmonic in a hyperdimensionallyresonant Torsion Physics—may not be credible to every reader, and he himselfprobably wouldn’t bet the house on a series of ET “dedicated archives” cached onMars, Luna, Pluto, etc., or cleverly coded, precisely timed combinationinformation/disinformation modules and a century-long conspiracy and hoax toinsert a coincidental bystander in the planetary pantheon as an imposter andTrojan horse. But he plays it as if he would.In principle and spirit, he is absolutely right; he has hit on precisely whatPluto is: the unknown wrapped in the unknowable, a mystery inside an enigmainside another mystery. Any story you give Pluto at the scale of the universeand the distance of any real answer from Earth fits.Notes Items anthologized in Pluto: New Horizons for a Lost Horizon are not noted.1.

It uses 228 watts of electricity generated by a radioisotopethermoelectric generator fueled by twenty-four pounds of plutonium-238 oxidepellets and has an array of imaging, radio, and particle and spectrum detectionequipment.Its roughly fifteen-year mission is to fly close to Pluto and its moons and theninto the solar system’s borderlands, gathering data. It took off from CapeCanaveral, Florida, on January 19, 2006 (the 197th anniversary of Edgar AllanPoe’s birth), and about a year later bent around Jupiter where it took somepictures and got a slingshotlike boost that increased its speed to about 52,000miles an hour. After that it was more or less a straight shot to Pluto, aboutthree billion miles from planet Earth. Its arrival date is July 14, 2015, andthe scientists hope it keeps chugging another five years or so into the KuiperBelt.It took space scientists nearly two decades to get the mission off the groundbecause the people who dole out the money for such projects weren’t really surewhat was to be gained (or who would gain it) by flying to Pluto. It is, afterall, far away, and what kind of wealth does an expensive mission like thatpromise? Even the information you got back would be destined mostly to oblivionin high-powered university computers and esoteric graduate seminars in planetaryastronomy. But after a lot of back and forth which included a healthy dose ofsimple public curiosity, in 2002 the U.S. Congress approved funding for ascaled-down version of the original, early 1990s project proposals.The mission has three main objectives: to accurately detail the geology andphysical structures of Pluto and its moon Charon; to detail and map theirsurface chemistries; and to detail Pluto’s atmosphere. Seems pretty simple. Ofcourse it’s not, because so many particles of information are radioing back toEarth that the scientific analysis and conclusions process will take decades. Atleast.The physical cosmos is mind-bogglingly detailed. Whole worlds that you can’t seeare crawling around on your coffee cup rim while you read this, and they allhave intricate patterns, structures, chemistries, and interrelationships thattook at least three and a half billion years to evolve and have so far takenhundreds of years to track down and describe. The work has barely begun. Even onthe next larger scale up from us, meaning the moons and planets, the detail isso fine that just spotting Pluto, which is 1,430 or so miles wide, took decadesof hypothesis and observation.People started speculating seriously in the latter part of the nineteenthcentury that there might be a planet beyond Uranus (first identified in 1781)and Neptune (tracked down in 1846), and various people, including PercivalLowell of the Martian civilizations theory, invested copious mathematical energytrying to predict where and how large it might be. On the momentum of Lowell’sefforts (he died in 1916), the young astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 found aspeck of light changing places from one spot to another on photographic plates,which turned out to be Pluto.Just a speck of light out there, indistinguishable from millions of other specksunless somebody with a telescope guides you to its exact location. So far awayand faint with reflected sunlight that even the Hubble Space Telescope, thegreatest device of its kind so far, gets only shadowy images of it.Curiosity about shadowy, seemingly distant things is always radiating insomebody’s mind, including the astronomers who lobbied for the New Horizonsmission, the mathematicians who wondered if Pluto was there before it was there,and generations of philosophers and mystics whose sense of the cosmic shadowsindicated that (for example) “there are innumerable suns, and an infinite numberof earths revolve around those suns, just as the seven [planets] we can observerevolve around this sun which is close to us.” How Giordano Bruno knew this, orguessed it, decades before Galileo trained a Walmart-quality telescope onJupiter and its moons, is not clear, but it turned out he was essentially right.As if the microbes, Earth, and solar system were not detail enough to last aninquisitive species a lifetime, the universe is so vast that there are chips,stones, and grains of dust lying on the surfaces of planets orbiting stars inmind-boggling numbers. Some astronomers think there could be ten quintillion(1019, or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000) planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone.Some guess there could be more than one hundred billion galaxies.From this view, Pluto really is a speck of dust. How could the details of itsgeology, chemistry, and atmosphere be so much more important than any othergrain in the cosmos that a mighty concentration of human mental energy gets setin motion and crystallizes in a half-ton of carefully configured metals,electricity, and radioactive isotopes and gets sent off specifically to findthem out?Well, one answer is: They’re not that important. But another answer is: They arefar away, and shadowy, and reachable.The scientists put almost all their mental energy into collecting andcategorizing physical facts. But occasionally, when nudged out of their datadreams, they offer a superficial cliché or two they hope will characterize theoriginal impulses that drew them there. Barrie Jones, in his book Pluto:Sentinel of the Outer Solar System, states it like this: “Aside from [the]scientific justification [for sending a robot to Pluto] is the human drive toexplore, a drive that permeates almost all cultures, and has done so throughouthuman history.” This is a rehearsal of George Mallory’s more concise expressionof his reason for climbing Mount Everest: “Because it’s there.”By and large the scientists do not say much more than this about it becausetheir interests, after all, lie in the physical facts, not the metaphysicalmotivations. But a conversation has been going on for a hundred years ormore—largely in the academic shadows, as it were—about what effect thescientific disposition toward what constitutes useful knowledge has on ourgeneral well-being. The hyper-rational philosopher Alfred North Whitehead warnedin the early decades of the twentieth century of the limitations ofhyper-rational thinking. The astronomer Arthur Eddington around the same timepointed out that, as powerful and practical as scientific inquiry is, there arenonetheless parts of reality that science cannot treat. Why is a joke funny?Scientific analysis can’t explain it, and annihilates the humor in the effort.There are other kinds of knowledge besides scientific. We know this. There is adisposition in science, though, that does not want to talk about other kinds ofknowledge and views them as either beside the point or simply illusory. Thenearest many scientists and philosophers of science come to talking about otherkinds of knowledge appears in phrases such as “the human drive to explore”—weexplore because we explore.Even detailed explanations of what phrases such as “the human drive to explore”mean do not seem well mapped to many scientists. Such explanations depart theworld of physical facts too quickly and enter those far-flung parts of realitythat science has trouble treating. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechendcall one of those territories “mythical knowledge.” They argue in Hamlet’s Millthat ancient cultures processed and preserved information about the stars,planets, and their motions through the telling of stories, symbolic rituals, andmusic. A human being living in such a culture would “have been a participant inthe process of mythical knowledge … In his own person, he would have been partof a genuine theory of cosmology, one he had absorbed by heart, that wasresponsive to his emotions, and one that could act on his aspirations anddreams. This kind of participation in ultimate things, now extremely difficultfor anyone who has not graduated in astrophysics, was then possible to somedegree for everyone, and nowhere could it be vulgarized.”In other words, knowledge of the cosmos was not simply a grasp of physical factsand their explanations, but a participation in them through “an idea of theoverall texture of the cosmos.” That texture is not a rational explanation ofphysical forces and interactions happening around and to you, but an experienceof your place and its activities fitting together with your own mind.Other scientific-age thinkers who tried to map the experiential territories thatseem beyond the borders of scientific inquiry include for example Carl Jung andJoseph Campbell. But despite these forays, we maintain a general culturalassumption that scientific inquiry and analysis is the most highly evolvedmental activity human beings can engage in. If prescientific peoples had theirown mythologies, those are sort of interesting and quaint and valid for them.But for us here in 2015, knowledge progresses evolutionarily and rationalscience is both the pinnacle and the cutting edge of that progression. Themind-boggling beneficences of medicine, communication, and transportation thatresult from applications of scientific thinking to physical details seem to bearthis out. On that momentum, the robot heads to Pluto.Out there where New Horizons is foraging for facts, it is unutterably vast andlonely. Pluto is on the edge of the solar system, meaning that on average it’ssomething over thirty-nine Earth-sun distances (or astronomical units) from thecenter. Another way of stating its distance and isolation is to observe that, astelescopes got better during the 1980s, ’90s, and 2000s, the astronomers grewless sure about what Pluto actually is. It started out as the ninth planet inthe 1930s but by 2006 got recategorized—amid considerable dissent—to “dwarfplanet” because it turns out that at least one thing out there is bigger thanPluto, and probably more. For the solar system has, in one way of describing it,three parts.First, there’s the solar system of conventional description. This includes theeight major planets (inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and outerplanets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and their moons. It also includesthe asteroids, which are sort of miniature planets and planet chunks orbitingthe sun mostly between Mars and Jupiter, but also other areas. In the vicinityof the outer planets they’re called centaurs.Second, just beyond the orbit of Neptune is a borderland called trans-Neptunianspace or the Kuiper Belt, or Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt, depending on who’s gettingcredit for predicting its existence. The Kuiper Belt is made up of asteroidlikechunks of rock and ice, collectively called Kuiper Belt Objects, of varyingsizes orbiting between about 30 and 50 astronomical units from the Sun. Plutoand slightly wider and more massive Eris are the two largest known KBOs among anestimated seventy thousand with diameters of more than about sixty miles. Themost distant large KBO detected so far is a dwarf planet called, as of April2014, 2012 VP113. Its nearest approach to the Sun is about 80 AU, and thefarthest extent of its orbit is estimated to be about 446 AU. It’s a littlesmaller than Sedna, whose closest approach to the Sun is about 76 AU, and atfarthest is around 937 AU away. It takes 2012 VP113 about 4,274 years to circlethe Sun once, and Sedna more than eleven thousand years.Third, beyond the Kuiper Belt and Sedna is the Oort Cloud, where an unknownabundance of comets slow-orbit the Sun. No one has ever seen anything in theOort Cloud because whatever’s out there is too small and distant fortelescopes—1,000 to 100,000 AU out. But the Oort Cloud is thought to be theorigin of long-period comets, meaning the ones that come streaking into our viewjust once, to return near Earth only after thousands of years, or possiblynever.The farther you get from the Sun, the more frayed everything is. Mercury, Venus,Earth, and Mars occupy orbits relatively compact to the central fire. A giantleap out from Mars, which is on average about one and a half times as far fromthe Sun as the Earth, the next big thing is Jupiter, looming so huge, there, 5.2astronomical units from the Sun, that its gravity acts like a shepherd oneverything inside the Kuiper Belt. Early on in the formation of ourneighborhood, Jupiter’s mass (equivalent to about 319 Earths) was so mighty thatit pushed Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune into the stable orbits they inhabit now.Saturn, more than three times smaller by mass than Jupiter but still enormous,in turn perturbed Uranus and Neptune, and those two, about seven times and fivetimes smaller by mass than Saturn (but fourteen and seventeen times larger thanEarth) swept their neighborhoods clear of many rocky, icy items like or smallerthan Pluto—and those are the Kuiper Belt Objects and comets, circling around theSun like spray on the edge of everything.After it cruised past Jupiter in February 2007, New Horizons went into ahibernation mode with a few wake-up periods to conduct checks. In the next eightyears, the empty space it traversed was, for all practical purposes, empty.Uranus and Neptune tooled along in other, far-flung parts of the solar system.The robot is not equipped to detect the scant sort of details lurking in thatpart of interplanetary space.About two hundred days before its closest approach to Pluto, New Horizons gripsdown, begins to awaken and starts taking pictures and measurements. In mid-July2015, it sweeps first within about 6,200 miles of Pluto’s surface, and fourteenminutes later within about 16,800 miles of Pluto’s large moon, Charon. Radiosignals pour data toward Earth. They take more than four hours to traverse threebillion miles.The astronomers were fairly confident about some of the details New Horizonswould find. Pluto’s surface is covered by nitrogen ice, which if you were towalk on it would have a granularity like snow. There are traces of methane andcarbon monoxide ices, and just under the surface of craters and otherwise rockydebris is likely to be water ice. The astronomers eagerly anticipate thepresence of water anywhere because it implies the presence of processes familiarto Earth. There is a sense, when water is detected or predicted in any quantity,that life is possible—either in the distant past, as on Mars, or even in thepresent, as underneath Jupiter’s moon Europa. No one predicts anything alive onPluto.The ices on Pluto’s surface vary with its seasons. Like all the planets, Pluto’sorbit is elliptical, and also, like Earth in particular, its axis of rotation istilted with respect to the Sun. These two factors combine to create changingconditions of light and temperature on the surface on both. But on Pluto theeffects are extreme. While Earth’s tilt is 23.5 degrees, Pluto’s tilt is 57.5degrees, and while Earth’s orbital eccentricity (meaning how much the orbit’selliptical shape varies from an exact circle) is 0.0167, Pluto’s eccentricity is0.251. These extreme variabilities, together with the fact that Pluto is so farfrom the Sun, create distinctly different conditions of light andtemperature—different seasons—in Pluto’s 249-year year.Pluto’s northern and southern hemispheres tip gradually into and out of theSun’s direct rays just like on Earth, but with steeper shadows at the wintersolstice and more direct light on the poles at the summer solstice. The speed ofany planet (or dwarf planet) varies according to its location in its ellipticalorbit, faster when nearer the Sun and slowing down when farther out. Because ofits steep inclination and its variable orbital speeds, Pluto’s seasons are notof equal lengths, as they are (roughly) on Earth.Summer and fall in Pluto’s northern hemisphere last about forty-two Earth-years,while winter and spring are about eighty-three Earth-years long. The southernhemisphere, meanwhile, has a shorter spring because Pluto is closer to the Sunduring that spell and therefore traveling faster. Because it’s so much closer tothe Sun during its spring, its temperatures then are probably higher than itstemperatures in summer. Its thin atmosphere is thought to expand in summer andshrink in winter in response to warmer, sunnier and colder, darker conditions.The astronomers treated most of this as fact before New Horizons’s encounter.The scientists are essentially, pragmatically uninterested in how these factsabout ice, sunlight, winter, and summer on Pluto fit together with your ownmind. But to wander off the beaten way of science for a moment, there issomething familiar to someone who lives in, say, Maine about the idea thatwinter and spring could be nearly twice as long as summer and fall. In thehinterlands of the imagination in the Great White Northeast is the perennialfeeling that the stretch of time from November to about early April lasts, well,about eighty-three years, while the stretch from April to October is surely halfthat, or less. In Maine’s deep winter, snow and ice cover everything. The airdries up, the nostrils and throat are perpetually irritated, and human skinturns to ancient papyrus.On Pluto, similarly, there is more nitrogen snow on the ground in winter becauseof something similar to dryness, and less on the ground in summer’s warmertemperatures because some of the snow sublimates into the atmosphere. Pluto’snorthern hemisphere will see its winter solstice in the year 2029. Its autumnalequinox was in 1987. On a January afternoon, the beauty at Maine’s autumnalequinox seems decades past.Of course, the average temperature on Pluto’s surface is around minus 370degrees Fahrenheit. Even the bitterest January day in Maine is not quite thatcold. Normally. And while in some southern backyard views in Maine the wintersun barely clears the fir tops, at similar latitudes on Pluto it descends morethan twice as low because of that 57.5 degree tilt. The shadows there are twiceas long and dimmer.And then there is the matter of Pluto’s distance from the Sun. The Earth is 1astronomical unit—about ninety-three million miles—from the Sun. Pluto is onaverage about 39.6 astronomical units from the Sun. In Pluto’s black sky, withatmosphere too thin to scatter blue light the way Earth’s does, the Sun shineseight hundred times less brightly than on Earth. It’s a sort of perpetualtwilight, somewhat brighter than a full moon, just enough light to read a book.But that landscape of frost and craters, mountains, cracks, and possibly icegeysers would be to an astronaut in some unspoken future invested with a qualityof strangeness and remoteness. Like in moonlight, geysers, craters, and frostwould appear to lose their actual substance, and become things of intellectalone.Up above, at least five moons loom. What the smaller ones, Styx, Nix, Hydra, andKerberos, might look like is uncertain. Bright lights rising and setting. ButCharon is another kind of monster. Our Moon spans 0.5 degrees in our sky, largeenough to seem mysterious, while Charon spans 3.5 degrees of arc in Pluto’s skybecause although smaller than our moon, it’s much closer to Pluto’s surface. Andunlike the Earth-moon system, Pluto and Charon are locked in one-to-one orbitalresonance, meaning Charon’s orbital period is exactly the same as Pluto’srotation period: 6.387 Earth-days. It hangs unmoving over one hemisphere ofPluto.For in technical terms this is not a planet-moon relationship. It is adouble-planet, or maybe double dwarf-planet, system. Charon’s diameter is morethan half of Pluto’s, and it was massive enough at the time its progenitor (mostlikely) wandered into Pluto’s gravitational vicinity and crashed that the centerof Charon’s orbit is not Pluto itself, but a gravity node just above Pluto,around which they both orbit.To an astronaut in that unforeseen human future plodding over Pluto’s twilightices, or to the imagination at work in Maine’s woods, Charon would be a giantglimmering nightmare. A huge, dimly lit shadow because it reflects so littlesunlight, seven times larger in the sky than our moon, looming motionless,caliginous-seeming, waiting. It might become an emblem, even in the mind of anastronaut, of the experience of Pluto’s frost-ridden surface, beetling shadows,and icy gleam. Such monstrosities of sky and cold might simply terrify anexplorer in a spacesuit.Or they might not. During that first moon landing in 1969, Buzz Aldrin famouslydescribed the lunar landscape as “magnificent desolation,” an oxymoron on anexperience of profound beauty in perceptually disorienting topography. Theastronauts had no context for judging how large or close the lunar boulders andmountains were. The light, shadow, and perspective were strange and remote.Pluto is much farther away and colder than the moon, much deeper on the edge ofscience’s epiphenomenal inability to connect physical reality to humanexperience. What a Pluto-walking astronaut might actually experience is notclear. It is not well-mapped territory.Under Pluto’s surface there might be an ocean of liquid water. This hypotheticaldetail provoked maybe the most excited speculation ahead of New Horizons’sencounter. “The subsurface ocean question is central to everything that we don’tknow yet about Pluto’s geology,” said one science writer in 2013.The ocean question is central to everything unknown about Pluto’s geologybecause it would solve the problem of Pluto’s internal structure. If inner Plutois an undifferentiated mix of rock and ices, that’s one thing, with one set ofimplications for how Pluto formed and evolved to its present frozen corpse-likestate. But if its interior is differentiated into a water layer and a rockycore, that’s something completely different. It means, for one thing, that thereis a significant heat source.Water gets the attention of astronomers and astrobiologists because it is a sortof common denominator. It’s central to everything we know about life on Earth.All living organisms, as far as we know, have water at the source of theirbiochemical processes. We came from water. Our bodies are made mostly of water.One of the clichés that justify the expenses of space exploration is that ithelps us learn about ourselves. So water is an elemental link. If an ocean ofwater exists under Pluto, then we will have found a fragment of our own sourcereflected there.The astrobiologists have all but ruled out the possibility of life in anyputative Plutonic water. The necessary organic nutrients are thought to havelong since leached away. But an ocean inside Pluto could be a sign of water onother large KBOs, like Eris. And they might still have their nutrients. Is therelife in the solar system’s borderlands?Key to knowing whether liquid water exists inside Pluto is knowing what processmight be melting ice. For there has to be a spark that raises the internaltemperature. There are five possible ways planets (and dwarf planets) generateheat: They may have heat left over from the energy released during theircrashbattering creation; heat released when denser materials churn downward andless dense materials churn upward; heat released in radioactive decay; heat fromtidal distortions like those that the Sun’s and Moon’s gravities cause the Earthand that Jupiter’s causes Europa; and heat released when liquid solidifies.It is known that Pluto gives off heat. It’s measured at a rate about 1 percentthat of Neptune. The planetary scientists’ prognosis is that the heat isgenerated either from creation, or from churning materials, or, in particular,from radioactivity. If an isotope of potassium is decaying in the core, then atemperature of around 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit might be generated. Enough heatto keep an ocean (containing some ammonia acting like antifreeze) liquid.The discovery of a heat source inside a place where hell has otherwise frozenover would constitute a wealth of information.Pluto’s name was suggested by the eleven-year-old granddaughter of an OxfordUniversity librarian. When Venetia Burney Phair’s grandfather Falconer Madanread a newspaper account of the new planet’s discovery at the breakfast table inMarch 1930, Venetia, having some knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology as wellas some schoolgirl astronomy, said, according to the accounts, “Why not call itPluto?” Grandfather Falconer’s brother had named Mars’ two moons, Phobos andDeimos, and liking Venetia’s idea, Falconer sent the suggestion up his line ofacademic contacts. It quickly reached the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, whereit had already come up for discussion, and was approved. The ninth planet wasPluto.Somehow Venetia’s guess, or intuition, or epinoia, worked. Pluto is indeeddistant and shadowy, qualities we conventionally ascribe to the underworld,whether taken for a real place or a fantasy. The astronomers were pleased withthe word Pluto because they by and large view the names of astronomical bodiesas entertaining whimsies. Scientific common sense presumes that ancient people,bright as they otherwise might have been, were nevertheless vastly ignorant ofphysical facts and so were restricted to concocting names by fantasyassociations. You can find on the Internet, for example, any number of reliablescientific authorities rehearsing the idea that Mars was named for the god ofwar because it appears red, and red implies blood, and blood implies war.It’s doubtful, however, that the ancient astronomers were really so superficial.An ancient name, like a planet’s geology, is nowhere near as simple as itscolor. Certainly, the ancients were no less intelligent and no less diligentthan our scientists, despite our mighty telescopes and advanced mathematics.Cave paintings in southern France that were made thirty-two thousand years agoreveal, at very least, proficiencies of stroke, line, composition, and color torival any artwork made in historical times. But those ancient geniuses did notpossess and were not seeking the same kind of knowledge modern astronomerspossess and seek. The astronomers of five thousand and more years ago not onlynoted a star or planet’s color and tracked its path, they also paid attention tothe particular kind of awe its luster worked on the mind’s eye. They would havebeen as interested in a Pluto-walking astronaut’s apprehensions of loomingCharon as the geology beneath his feet. Probably more so.Venetia, little as she was aware at the time, accurately expressed certainimplicit details of Pluto no one else could know either. The name appears “tofit into archetypes that are already there,” the astrologer Phil Poirier said ina conversation, and those archetypes involve that which is shadowy, unknown, atthe edge of human control, and transitional to previously unseen realities. Wasthe twentieth century uncovering of horrors, Poirier asked, from the Holocaustto sexual abuse in the church to the burgeoning of mental health therapies,merely coincidental to the discovery of Pluto and its approach to perihelion in1989? To the scientific mind the answer is resoundingly: Yes, of course. On theother hand, a planet (or dwarf planet) has a presence in the mind beyond itsrock and ice. Whether that presence is simply a metaphor, or something morefundamentally interconnected to experience, in either case those mentalexperiences are more than whimsical associations to a color. They are part of acontinuous texture.“The sky is just the same as the earth, only up above, and older,” a Micmacstoryteller told an anthropologist around the turn of the last century,distantly echoing a certain kind of knowledge from ancient times.Pluto does not mean hell, exactly, although that’s the conventional notion. It’seasy to daydream of metaphorical Charon sculling his boat nearby, waiting. Butwhen you get inside the word, you discover that Pluto is not the underworldplace, but instead the ruler himself of Hades. In ancient Greece, the underworldwas the place where valuable minerals were found.“Pluto gives wealth (ploutos),” Socrates explains in Plato’s Cratylus, “and hisname means the giver of wealth, which comes out of the earth beneath. People ingeneral appear to imagine that the term Hades is connected with the invisible,and so they are led by their fears to call the god Pluto instead.… In spite ofthe mistakes which are made about the power of this deity, and the foolish fearswhich people have of him, such as the fear of always being with him after death,and of the soul denuded of the body going to him, my belief is that all is quiteconsistent, and that the office and the name of the god really correspond.”To know what’s inside Pluto might be central to everything.You need a telescope to see it. In July 2015, it’s nearly 32 astronomical unitsaway and reflects sunlight back at magnitude 14.1. By comparison, Uranus andNeptune, at magnitudes 5.8 and 7.8, are bright enough to be seen on dark, clearnights with binoculars, if you know how to read the star maps.For us in the early twenty-first century Northern Hemisphere, Pluto ismeandering the southern sky in Sagittarius, which is just about the overall mostlight-filled constellation because in that direction lies the fullness of starsat the galaxy’s nucleus. On July 14, 2015, Pluto is a bit northwest of thatcenter. It’s just below Venus, which that morning is near its boiling brightestat magnitude minus 4.7. At another time of year you could, with somedetermination and a four-and-a-half-inch reflecting telescope, spot Pluto nearthe x Sagittarius stars (36 and 37 Sgr, with naked-eye magnitudes of 5.1 and3.5). At this time of summer, though, the Sun is about to rise in northernlatitudes, and dawn washes out almost everything but Venus.Even in the telescope accurately aimed from your backyard clearing, Pluto isjust a tiny speck of light among a million others. And so no matter whether youcan match one crystal-cold dot in a lens to a dot on a star map, or justestimate its general location with your eye, its presence is largely a figmentof your imagination. Your imagination can travel in a lot of directions.The most well worn of those in our eon is mapped by robots. Voyagers I and IIand Pioneers 10 and 11 years ago cleared the elliptical vicinity of Pluto’sorbit. Voyager I in 2015 is beyond the defined range of the Kuiper Belt anddrilling along through interstellar space. When your mind is imagining it outthere like this, you can kind of keep a grip simultaneously on the feelings ofawe and trepidation that thoughts of deep space inspire and on the basicphysical data, such as the figures that describe distances: Voyager I in March2014 was more than 127 astronomical units from the Sun. That is a graspablenumber reflecting a chilling kind of isolation.At some indefinite psychological intersection, the objective fact meets the mindand gets a shape. One of the shapes is rational: It goes into a category andbecomes part of a description of a physical process or condition. Another of theshapes is emotional: the image of deep space inspires a feeling of cold awe,possibly fear.Science eschews emotions. They are obstacles to rational clarity. Trepidation,awe, fear, hope, desire, pity, animosity, avarice and so on act like smears onthe telescope lens of rational thought and you can get lost in them as if inpathless woods. You do not want your astronauts walking around on the moon, letalone on Pluto, frightened out of their wits.On the other hand, part of the reason you go out to the backyard with yourlittle reflecting telescope is to put yourself in the way of awe andtrepidation. You can’t, after all, gather any details that the astronomers withpowerful robots haven’t already got.The Pluto of awe and trepidation is a shape in the mind that might have grippedEdgar Allan Poe’s imagination. Floating up there somewhere in Sagittarius, afigure of darkness, shadows, and icy desolation. For Poe, beyond thefundamental, even adolescent-seeming horrors of his stories was one of theWestern world’s important proto-psychologists. He made some of the first modernmaps of differentiations in the human mind, predecessors of Freud’sconscious/unconscious layers and Jung’s core archetypes and collectiveunconscious. Poe’s maps of our mental geology show that the experience of Truthis processed through the Intellect, whose faculty is Reason; the experience ofDuty is processed through the Moral Sense, whose faculty is Conscience; andBeauty is processed through the Soul, whose faculty is Taste; what Poe callsPassion is parallel to what he, and we, somewhat nebulously refer to as theHeart.In Poe’s view of the human mind, the objective, scientific facts of Pluto mightinspire feelings that correspond, in a phrase made by an explorer, tomagnificent desolation, where the intellect grasps the desolation, and thefaculty of taste (in its nineteenth century sense) experiences the magnificence.Astronomers, however, bypass these experiences as besmearing emotions, andneuroscientists discard this kind of psychology as, well, immaterial. For theonly concrete evidence of mental or emotional experience is in tabulations ofbiochemical activity. And since the only physical evidence of the existence ofmental activity is in chemicals, it is confidently assumed that the chemicalsgenerate the activity. In other words, thoughts, emotions, and awareness itselfare produced by biochemical activities. Consciousness is a byproduct of, orepiphenomenal to, chemical processes.But if chemical activity in the brain is generating the awareness of physicalperceptions such as cold, starlight, salt, thunder, and sulfur, then what ishappening when the objective facts meet experiences and faculties inhabitingreaches of the mind beyond the range of raw emotion? If outer physical eventstrigger chemical reactions that result in sensory perception, then what triggersthe chemical reactions that register nonsensory, mental experiences such asbeauty?Plenty of scientists, going back at least to Whitehead and Eddington, know verywell that the five senses detect nowhere near the whole range of physicalreality. We perceive only a tiny fragment of all the wavelengths of light thatcomb the universe; no one has ever smelled a quark. Despite the best efforts ofmodern science to deny or ignore them, signals other than five-sensory arecoming out of the cosmos, and religious adepts explored and elucidated theirsources long before Poe.The astronomer Robert Jastrow a few decades ago gave a parable of scientificknowledge’s link to religious knowledge: A modern scientist after a lifetime ofwork finds he “has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer thehighest peak; [then] as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by aband of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”Once you climb out of the foothills, names are no longer whims, and metaphorsare no longer toys. About two-thirds of the way up Mount Purgatory, Dante turnsto speak to his guide, Virgil—who signifies the strength of rational mindrequired to navigate the horrors of hell and the disciplines of purgation—onlyto find that the guide has peeled off and disappeared because his rationalintelligence serves no purpose farther up. There is another kind of knowledge atthe mountaintop, and it is encountered in Beatrice.Beyond the emotional and then beyond the rational are ranges of experience in apsychic borderland difficult to describe because it is, in a way, so distantfrom everyday perceptual reality. It is for the most part so far off scientificmaps that neuroscience denies it even exists. Its images seem shadowy anddisorienting. It can be described here no more clearly than as the silence thatemerges when noise subsides, or as the realization that the image in a mirror,very clear to your physical eyes, is empty. Not the rational or figurativeconcept that the mirror is empty, but the realization of its emptiness.Out of the sky and down through the firs into the tube of the little telescopeflows starlight. It strikes a mirror at the bottom of the yard-long cylinder andbounces back up onto another mirror that reflects it again into a lens thatfunnels photons into your eye. Inside your skull the light signals transpireinto a texture of the cosmos. It’s a state of mind that stargazers deliberatelyseek.At first, on a July pre-dawn, that texture is experienced like a door openinginto fresh air. It unfolds into the feeling, maybe, that what’s above is thesame as what’s below, only older. Much older. The overarching feeling, whateverelse goes with it, is that the sky is unspeakably beautiful.The light you’re seeking this July morning is hidden in the borderlands of thesolar system among a millionfold fullness of vastly more distant lights. Sunrays travel three billion miles, strike Pluto’s frost surface and bounce backEarth-ward to a four-and-a-half-inch mirror pointed toward the galactic center.A tiny point of reflected light pierces your eye.Streaking past Pluto this morning is a robot so tiny in comparison to a moonthat its reflection can’t be detected by telescope. But built into it is anartificial life of radioactivity and electricity configured to collect signalsfrom the dwarf-planet system and send them on beams of light back to Earth witharcane mathematical coherency. It’s the same coherency that emanates us-ward instarlight, arranged so it corresponds to the wavelengths we detected first byeye and then deduced are signs of further wavelengths that transcend theeyeball. It’s as if we sent a replica of ourselves out there. The robot picks updata and reflects them back toward Earth, mirroring the processes of perceptionand communication. It carries the same radioactive spark that probably liquefieswater inside Pluto, where under slightly different circumstances life mightblossom.Nothing the robot sends back can be detected by the eye among the pre-dawn firs,even with a telescope. But something else is bouncing among the tiny Earth-boundtelescope’s mirrors that the robot can’t detect. Signals of vastness,loneliness, and power reflected in as if from a sentinel on the edge ofeverything.Pluto, though, to us is lifeless. A remnant of ancient warfares among planetarygravities. Whatever the robot finds will be frozen, dead matter. A corpse, in away. Its very epinoian name reflects the ruler of the place we all descend to:dark oblivion, or the energy that coheres some eonic afterworld from whose bournno traveler returns. The robot is configured to find dead matter only, and beingno more than a reflection of a human being, can’t imagine anything else. Thehuman scientists are trained to dissect, analyze, and describe the findings.They hope to find inside the body an interior spark that—hope upon hope—willhelp us learn about ourselves. Inside Pluto is a wealth of information.“Let us not underrate the value of a fact,” Thoreau observed; “it will one dayflower in a truth.” He meant that the physical world is a reflection ofnonsensory cosmic textures; and he thought of those textures as the moral world,which itself is a kind of foothills or border to ranges farther up the mountainwhere some mystics and enlightened scientists are taking a rest. They see thatmatter, a momentary configuration of energy, is essentially empty. If theyfollowed the conventions of science they would become mired in dissectingdetails and find, to paraphrase an ancient mystic, nothing more than a corpse.The facts, isolated from the cosmic texture, are empty desolation. But when thefaculty that detects beauty recognizes that emptiness, then silence blossomsinto a clarifying voice, silently shining to silent moons.New Horizons, unbeknownst to itself, has gone to the borderlands on a quest forgnosis.Sources for “Pluto on the Borderlands”Boyle, Alan.

That same year, Johann Bode, in hisIntroduction to the Study of the Starry Sky, restated the progression with thespecific recommendation that there was another planet at 2.8 times the Earth’sdistance from the Sun (or seven times Mercury’s distance and four times Venus’sdistance). When Uranus, upon discovery, fit Bode’s progression so closely, thesearch for Bode’s “missing” planet was intensified, but it was not until NewYear’s Day, 1801, that Giuseppi Piazzi, an Italian astronomer, found an8th-magnitude star in Taurus that changed position over the next two nights. OnJanuary 14, it ceased its retrograde motion and began moving forward in relationto the Earth’s motion and the reciprocal positions of the two bodies. Assumingit to be a full-fledged planet, Piazzi named it Ceres. Then he lost it as Tauruspassed into sunlight, after which he became ill and was unable to continuetracking. It was not located again until December, when Karl Friedrich Gauss,using an orbit computed from only three figures, spotted it.Thereafter, astronomers flocked to see the new world. Ceres fit Bode’sprogression almost perfectly, but it was so tiny that it offered no planetarydisk. While astronomers were puzzling over this, Wilhelm Olbers, in April of1802, found a second object in a proximate orbit; this was named Pallas. Junowas detected nearby in 1804 and Vesta in 1807. By 1852, there were twenty knownasteroids (or planetoids, as they were also called), and by 1870, there were110. Once the chase was joined, they were disclosed all the way down to the 12thmagnitude, including some that swing beyond Saturn and others that pass withinthe orbit of Venus. Hence the harmonic gap, the planetary (and musical) intervalbetween Mars and Jupiter, like a shattered piano was filled provisionally by amultitude of tiny keys (planetoids) that also strayed from the soundboard. Ofthese, Hermes, Eros, and Icarus have each made near approaches to the Earth inrecent times. We are not talking about meteor-size rocks. Icarus is almost amile across and weighs 2.9 × 1032 kilograms. In New York City, that wouldstretch from 42nd Street to the Upper West Side in sheer spherical girth, whichis the size of the crater it would leave while preserving little evidence ofanything prior. It’s a baby but a big baby.In modern times we have come to appreciate the existential danger to our worldfrom stray solar bodies of planetoid size, for an “impact event” with even amedium-size asteroid would release as much energy as several million nuclearbombs detonating simultaneously and might set Earth’s oxygen on fire. Our mostimmediate threat (in 2013) is a thousand-foot-diameter asteroid named Apophiswhich presently stands a 1-in-250,000 chance of having its orbit knocked into aterrestrial collision course with an estimated arrival of April 13, 2026. Inrisk-assessment analysis, this may not be a high-probability hazard, but it isoff the charts in magnitude of potential loss. The difficulty of implementingeffective countermeasures for Earth’s vulnerability to renegade worlds can neverexceed the expectation of damage, hence the recent scurry to identify and trackeven the tiniest asteroids’ orbits—there is always the danger of a CosmicHustler:Paul Newman (as Fast Eddie): “Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool.”Jackie Gleason (as Minnesota Fats): “So do you, Fast Eddie.”1In 1846, John Adams, the British astronomer, and Urbain Leverrier of Francesimultaneously predicted the discovery of an eighth planet, using Newton’s lawsand computing its positions by the hypothesized perturbations that an unknownplanet had caused in the positions of Uranus. Neptune was first observed, atleast with awareness of what it was, by German astronomer Johann Galle, who usedLeverrier’s predicted position of September 23, 1846. After finding an8th-magnitude star that was not in a current star chart he was using, Gallecontinued to observe it and recognized that it was moving in a retrogradedirection in close proximity to Leverrier’s estimates of size and speed as wellas location. He then wrote to Leverrier that “the planet whose position you havepointed out actually exists.”2On September 10 of that year, John Herschel peered through his telescope at thisnew world and declared: “We see it as Columbus saw America from the shores ofSpain. Its movements have been felt trembling along the far-reaching line of ouranalysis with a certainty hardly inferior to ocular demonstration.”3It was like prying open the door to a mausoleum that had been sealed for abillion years.A month later, William Lassell, using a new mirror telescope, discovered Triton,the very large moon of Neptune, which is brighter from Earth than any ofUranus’s moons. It was named by Camille Flammarion in 1880 in AstronomiePopulaire, but until 1933, it was more familiar to the world as “Neptune’ssatellite.”It is interesting to note that, even though a planet is discovered at a certainhistorical period, it is often recognized later that it was already familiar asa star. The ancients saw Uranus, but it was too faint and slow-moving to exciteinterest in its possible planetary nature. John Flamsteed observed the planet atleast six times, the first in 1690, but he catalogued it only as 34 Tauri. Thenbetween 1750 and 1769, French astronomer Pierre Lemonnier recorded Uraniansightings at least twelve times, four of them on consecutive nights, yet stillconsidered it a star or several stars. American astronomer Sears Walker searchedLalande’s eighteenth-century catalogue for unknown stars on the nights and inthe positions where Neptune would have been visible, and he used these likelysightings in completing its improved elliptical orbit in 1847.When Neptune was found to be well off its expected position from Bode’sprogression (30.05 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun instead of38.4), the “law” lost any remaining credence. It actually belonged more toKepler’s universe of geometric solids, and its main role had been historical inguiding the search for new planets.The forecast of Neptune by two independent experimental astronomers in the sameyear was not without controversy. Leverrier was the more famous and also themore egotistical of the two, and Adams’s prior discovery went unreported formany months because the British Astronomer Royal, George Airy, did not believein the existence of trans-Uranian planets and did not take his resultsseriously. When Adams’s prediction was announced later, Leverrier and his Frenchsupporters vigorously fought against sharing the historical credit. In fact,Leverrier wanted the new planet given his own name and self-servingly suggestedthe name Herschel for Uranus.This competition masks another, far more interesting complication that has beenforgotten but not resolved. The credit for discovering a planet generally goesto the person whose formulas predicted its position, often instead of the personwho actually finds it. Galle found Leverrier’s planet for him. But Galle’s“star” also corresponded to Adams’s prediction for the same night, even thoughAdams and Leverrier had different orbits for their planets, neither of whichcorresponded even remotely to Neptune’s actual orbit, nor to each other, exceptat the periods when they all intersected. That the three ellipses should havecome so close to perfect intersection (the hypothetical ones of Adams andLeverrier and the real one of Neptune the planet) on the night that Galle choseto look is a stroke of synchronicity and luck almost too fantastic to believe.Both sets of calculations were based on Bode’s inaccurate estimates of Neptune’ssize and distance from the Sun. They were also based on the extremely subtlecalculations of not only Uranus’s perturbations of the unknown body but thatbody’s perturbations of Uranus, and on an accurate Newtonian orbit for Uranus,with all of the other gravitational influences on it in the Solar System. Thisis a difficult “solution” to arrive at for many of the outer planets even today.Perhaps Neptune was found because so many astronomers were in the hunt. (By thesame logic, the hypothetical planet that lies between Mercury and the Sun,Vulcan, was “observed” many times throughout the nineteenth century because somany astronomers were looking for a body to resolve anomalies in the perihelionof Mercury.)Given these controversies, officials of the time chose to credit Leverrier withthe discovery of Neptune because it was found through using his formula, eventhough his hypothetical planet and Neptune crossed at only a few points. Havingbestowed this accolade, the officials were compelled later to give Adams equalcredit, since his planet crossed both Leverrier’s and Neptune at the discoverypoint.A related dilemma became more significant in subsequent decades, after it becameclear that neither the existence of Neptune nor the later discovery of Plutofully resolved the anomalies in Uranus’s orbit. Even today with advancedcomputers and adjustments from numerous Pluto-size Kuiper Belt Objects, we stillcan’t find what is causing these perturbations—it is not trivial and it may noteven be singular in source. Crypto-astronomers and conspiracy theorists havefurnished astrophysicists with a gaggle of mythical planets, imaginary planets,hidden planets, and artificial planets—“Nibirus” and “Nemeses,” anti-Earths andmirror Earths—for mainstream scientists (of course) to summarily dismiss. Butthese worlds’ ghosts and collective menace haunt the outskirts of solarcosmology. We just don’t know all that’s out there, buried in long orbits orcamouflaged fields. For our substantial hubris, we are quite insular andsequestered in our own backyard.The Neptune situation is summarized well by the historian William Graves Hoyt,quoting from the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell: “Leverrier andAdams … had assumed too great a distance for their unknown planet from Bode’slaw, but their calculations also ‘made the orbit considerably eccentric(although it is really very nearly circular),’” and this “spurious eccentricitybrought the predicted orbit toward the sun in the region where the planetactually lay at the time, and went far to undo the error of the two originalassumptions.”4 Apparently Neptune was ready to be found.Untold other planets may exist between Neptune and the comets, invisible to usfor the same reason that planets circling other suns are invisible: their faintreflected light does not reach us. Their sizes would be limited to a range atwhich their gravitational effects would not be readily apparent in the rest ofthe Solar System. Phantom planets received far more attention early in thetwentieth century than they do now, as astronomers regularly extrapolated themfrom unexplained perturbations in the orbits of Neptune, Uranus, and evenSaturn, and from anomalies in orbits of comets.William Pickering, the American astronomer at Harvard, was the most prolificplanetary model-maker between the years 1928 and 1931. His first quasi-planet,“O,” was placed at almost fifty-two times the Earth’s distance from the Sun. Itorbited the Sun every 373.5 years and had a mass twice that of the Earth’s.Pickering derived “O” in 1928 solely from residuals in the orbit of Uranus. Afew years later, he announced three more planets: “P” was located at 123 AUs,with a year of 1,400 Earth-years; it was based on variations in cometary orbits.“Q” was located at 875 AUs; it had a mass twenty-thousand times that of theEarth, a year of twenty-six thousand Earth-years, an eccentric orbit, and asharp orbital inclination. “Q” was big enough to counterbalance the wholesystem—to operate, gravitationally, as a second, invisible Sun. “R” was locatedat 6,250 times the Earth’s distance from the Sun. Its mass was half that of “Q,”and its orbital period was half a million years.5“S” was located at forty-eight times the Earth’s distance from the Sun, withfive times the Earth’s mass and a year of 336 Earth-years. “T” was invented tocover the few remaining anomalies in Uranus’s orbit and was placed just outsidethe orbit of Neptune. “U” was later placed outside the orbit of Jupiter in aneccentric path that sometimes carried it closer to the Sun than the giantplanet; it was only 4.5 percent of the Earth’s mass.6Needless to say, none of Pickering’s planets has ever been found.The quest for a ninth planet in our Solar System began in the manner of thesearch that led to the discovery of Neptune. It was an exhausting, fruitlessobsession over three decades, with an ambiguous resolution in 1930. PercivalLowell began the quest at the turn of the century from his observatory atFlagstaff, Arizona. Working with unexplained residuals in the orbits of Uranusand Neptune, he calculated the probable orbit of Planet X, and then he and hisstaff proceeded to search for it throughout the likely regions of the sky. ButLowell recognized “that when an unknown is so far removed relatively from theplanet it perturbs, precise prediction of its place does not seem to bepossible. A general direction alone is predictable.”7 He died in 1916, beforeX’s discovery.The man who would eventually “land” Planet X was Clyde Tombaugh, a self-taughtastronomer who worked on his family farm in Kansas during the day and studiedthe heavens at night with a nine-inch reflecting telescope that he hadconstructed himself. He applied repeatedly to the Lowell Observatory for a job;astronomer Vesto Slipher, impressed with his drawings of Jupiter (“fairly goodfor such a chap working all alone”)8 eventually hired him. Slipher gambled thatthis ambitious, self-stoked lad with only a high school education would be moreproductive in the search for X than another university type. Tombaugh wastwenty-three years old when he became the last person to discover a new solar“planet.”Tombaugh worked by exposing plates on good nights and then “blinking” successiveexposures of the same area on different nights in a special machine to see ifany “star” moved. Searching down to the 17th magnitude, he encounteredinnumerable difficulties in both exposing the plates and producing blinkablepairs. The most serious obstacle was the thousands of asteroids moving throughthe zodiac. Tracking at this high level of magnitude, he was plagued by theirconstant blinking. “The key strategy,” Tombaugh concluded, “was to take theplates within 15 degrees of the opposition point, so that the daily parallacticmotion of the Earth would cause all bodies external to the Earth’s orbit toretrograde through the star field—the more distant the object the smaller theangular displacement during the interval between the dates the plates weretaken. This solved the asteroid problem beautifully.”9After months of scouring Lowell’s proposed orbit for Planet X without aplanet-like glimmer, Tombaugh began an exhaustive search of the entire zodiac inSeptember 1929. He snaked from Aquarius into Pisces, from Pisces into Aries, andthen into Taurus and Gemini. In eastern Taurus and western Gemini, the averagenumber of stars per plate increased from fifty thousand to five hundred thousandas he crossed toward Milky Way center. By early November, Tombaugh was inScorpius and Sagittarius and was encountering a million stars per plate.Disappointed, he returned to western Gemini in January 1930. Blinking two goodexposures of the Delta Geminorum region from January 23 and 29, he saw ashifting star, Planet X.Since it was found at Lowell’s observatory, under the auspices of his search, byan astronomer using his tables, Lowell was given credit for having discoveredthe planet along with Tombaugh. Meanwhile, William Pickering claimed that thenew body was his Planet “O”; then, when he learned of its meager size, hediscarded it immediately as a significant perturbing influence on its neighbors.The perturbation on Neptune’s orbit requires a planet or medley of planets withdiameters adding up to something in the neighborhood of fifty thousand cubicmiles’ worth of gravitational pull. Pluto’s girth weighs in, at most, at 4,200miles, while some astronomers believed at the time that it was no bigger thanCeres (around six hundred).In any case, Pluto turns out not to be the last of the planets (as presumed fordecades) but the first of the Kuiper Belt Objects. As a KBO or dwarf planet, itdoesn’t so much close the legendary curtain on Uranus and Neptune as open a newone on Varuna and Quaoar.Astronomers conducting photometric research on Pluto late in the twentiethcentury at the University of Hawaii concluded that Pluto’s mass was a fewthousandths that of the Earth. This is “much less than would be required toperturb the motions of Uranus and Neptune measurably.… If this train of logic isbasically correct, it appears that Tombaugh’s discovery of Pluto in 1930 was theresult of the comprehensiveness of the search rather than the prediction fromplanetary dynamics.”10But then, where is Lowell’s predicted trans-Neptunian planet? Forget Nibiru fornow—that is a different myth. Something is still missing.For all intents and purposes, Pluto had been used to save the appearance ofLowell’s phantom, which it didn’t. It did, however, give mid-twentieth-centuryastronomers a way to pretend that the mystery had been solved (more or less),much as nineteenth-century astronomers pretended that Ceres had saved Bode’slaw.Even the choice of its name, Pluto instead of the more popular Minerva,conferred a tinge of murk and spooky fortuity, not only that the overseer of theRoman Underworld should rightly rule a remote, sunless realm but that the firsttwo letters of the name of a major available god should be Percival Lowell’sinitials. The PL symbol for the planet thus could indirectly honor Lowell. Yetclearly it is no more his planet than Pickering’s, though Pickering was quitesatisfied with the name, which he read as Pickering-Lowell.A Plutonian satellite, named Charon, was discovered by James Christy and AnthonyHewitt in 1978. This allowed measurement of Pluto’s mass by Kepler’s third lawand confirmed the small size of the planet and the relative largeness of itsmoon (1,430–1,443 miles in diameter for Pluto, 750 for Charon being the mostrecent estimates at the time of this writing). Charon and Pluto revolve aroundeach other every 6.387 days. Pluto/Charon turns out to have four other tinymoonlets: Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. The latter two were found in 2011 and2012, respectively.Plutonian moons’ approximate diameters are loosely derived from ranges suggestedby their geometric albedo. Nix falls somewhere between 28.5 and 85 miles indiameter (depending on its actual albedo) with an orbital period of 25 days.Hydra is between 38 and 104 miles in diameter with an orbital period of 38.2days. Nix is in close to 1:4 orbital resonance with Charon, and Hydra close to1:6 with the larger moon. Kerberos, between eight and twenty-one miles indiameter, is itself in 1:5 orbital resonance with Charon, while Styx, six tosixteen miles across, shares a 1:3:4:5:6 sequence of near resonances with Nix,Kerberos, and Hydra. The barycenter of their orbits does not lie within anysingle body, so “Pluto” is more properly a swarm. It is not so much that onerelatively large moon and several smaller ones orbit the planet as that theentire swarm orbits its own center of mass.Prior to the discovery of Charon, astronomers favoring Pluto as the perturbinginfluence on Uranus and Neptune offered a number of mostly bizarre explanationsfor its ostensible small size. Some hypothesized that it is such a dark frozenplanet that we see only a three-thousand-mile-wide glint of itsfifty-thousand-mile-wide sphere, a sparkle on a shiny ebony ball. That led toanother, only slightly more likely but decidedly more titillating suggestion:that Pluto is a white dwarf or a black hole, a burned-out cinder from the otherhalf of a twin Sun system of which our present Sol is the remainingrepresentative. Pickering jumped on that bandwagon briefly, hoping to salvagehis Planet “O” by offering that it might be a stray white dwarf picked up fromanother star system and thus the only body in the Solar System with an originoutside it. These attributes would give it the necessary mass for its supposedperturbations.With more accurate measurements of the body’s mass, assorted Plutonian fantasiashave fallen by the wayside, though the mystery of the secret perturber remains.If not Nibiru, perhaps it is the cinder-sun Nemesis (which is said to approachits rival Sol every twenty-six million years with a glorious retinue of comets).(I am playing dumb astronomically but not mythologically.)In endless night, Pluto travels 2.7 billion miles from its governing star, atwhich remove it takes 248 Earth-years to make its annual circuit. We know howfast light travels: 186,000 miles per second is beyond conception, faster than acartoon roadrunner. Blink and it’s traveled from New York to Paris and backtwenty-five times. Yet, the Sun’s light still requires 3.22 real-time minutes toreach Mercury. A twinkle of that same ray takes five hours and twenty-eightminutes to reach Pluto. If we imagine a beam of light whipping off the Sun’ssurface at 186,000 miles per second, zooming down the corridors of interminabledarkness and space so fast that it opens shafts that disappear into the distanceeven as they come from a remote darkness in another direction, then we canunderstand how far is that five-hour-and-twenty-eight-minute light-journey.The temperature at Pluto, minus 369 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, would freezeany atmosphere. If a flock of magpies were released there, they would shatteragainst the sky faster than they would congeal on a bare branch in aSaskatchewan winter.As a child of the primal nebula, Pluto’s composition should be water, ammonia,and methane ice, with occasional crisp haze, for these are the last substancesto condense from the disk’s outer rings in the cold of deep space. A plausibleplanetary model calls for a water-ice core, a methane and ammonia mantle, afrozen methane crust, perhaps some dead methane seas, and, at most, a scantatmospheric presence. There is a remote chance of an underground sea, perhapswarmed to liquid by geological activity. What a strange lagoon that would be!Imagine traveling a couple of billion miles across frigid, black space, landingon gaseous metallic rock, and then taking a hydraulic lift a few thousandadditional miles through a tunnel to bathe in a sacred Plutonian hot spring.The world briefly known as Minerva is almost certainly a barren, spaless KBO.Because Pluto is the only full-fledged orb traveling outside the ecliptic thatmakes up the zodiac—i.e., transiting at an angle to the plane of the SolarSystem like a sewing needle and thread darning into and out of a piece offabric, the fabric containing the other planets and moons—it was presumed forits first sixty years most likely to have been a moon of Neptune that gotknocked loose by a large scattering object. Recent computer models, however,have indicated that, no matter the scale of an intruder, gravity and debrisconditions could not have displaced anything the magnitude of Pluto fromNeptune’s attraction and orbit into its present position. Most scientists nowthink Pluto formed in the early Solar System through a sort of checkeredaccretion and crashing process.The dwarf planet’s course around the Sun is also quite eccentric compared toNeptune’s near-perfect circle. In fact, on December 11, 1978, Pluto moved withinNeptunian orbit, reaching perihelion on September 12, 1989. Neptune then becamethe outermost planet of the original nine and remained so until February 11,1999, when Pluto swung out beyond it again, en route to aphelion in 2113. Inabout 230 years Pluto and Neptune will switch places again. At the same time,Pluto stands in 2:3 orbital resonance with the outermost ice giant.A Plutonian day is hard to fix without surface features, but variations inbrightness suggest 153 hours. Pluto’s density is guessed to be 88 percent thatof the Earth, in this respect more like the inner than the outer planets.It will have taken 9.5 years for NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, launchedJanuary 19, 2006, to escape Earth’s gravity well and be slingshot by gas and icegiants to Pluto. When it arrives at the swarm on July 14, 2015, I would like itto photograph boulevards of apartment buildings and shops resembling midtownManhattan. I look forward to the face-saving explanations by scientists. I wouldsavor the reductionist interpretation of the cosmos failing at the edge of ourSolar System, as Pluto directs our attention outward to Centauri, not back toTerra, for the lost continent and its archetypal city.Pluto/Charon at the traditional Solar System’s outer gate, clandestine in itsorbit, bears death and rebirth, absolute power and “soul intent.” UnityExistence put its nano-hand on Pluto/Charon on February 18, 1930, bringing itsblip into worldview at precisely the moment that its manifestation was poised toflood over us. But nothing actual was transmitted—no liqueur, radiation, orether spilled on the Earth. Springs were loaded. They uncoiled forces accessibleonly in horoscopes, as they potentiated a psychoastronomical field. Wholeuniverses of being sprang into expression under Pluto, as inner worlds turnedover, casting their debris outward. Unsignified meanings never before on Earthbroke through.Of course, Pluto itself is a nubbin of a world, demoted from even fullplanethood. Clearly astrologers are not talking about the gravitational tug ofthe swarm: a pip with an accompanying moon and a few moonlets. Instead, they arereading an occult clock that uses a Plutonian marker to designate a position andtiming mechanism in an otherwise imperceptible field.The series of near resonances among Pluto’s moons could be used, at leastsymbolically, to explain the amplification of the planet’s astrologicaltransmission to the rest of the Solar System. Of course, to have such a pendingexplanation you would have to know how astrology “works,” so it’s best just tosay that satellite resonance coincides with the sign’s augmentation.Pluto probably hatched forms astrologically on the zodiacal bodies of Neptune,Saturn, Jupiter, Ceres, Chiron, Mars, Venus, and all the other proximal worldsand objects insofar as each has a potential alias within terrestrial astrologyas well as an astrological field of its own. At the moment that it enteredEarth’s symbolic field, Pluto pervaded every world in the Solar System on subtleplanes, though it was already operating universally at an unconscious, nonhumanlevel. Call it a metaphor for the diversity and depth of Plutonian influence andits ensuing terrestrial projections onto other planets and planetoids after itsdiscovery but, in any case, the relationship between Tombaugh’s and Pickering’shidden perturber and the symbols it instantaneously generated made the signsinterchangeable and correlative; after all, every single one worked. Theyprobably would have worked even if the Lilliputian orb had been Minerva.Pluto is a realization of dark forces that have been operating under the radarand then suddenly burst into cognizance. This is what happened after theplanet’s identification in Gemini and its subsequent promulgation andchristening. Once Pluto was accepted into the human gestalt, Plutonian forcesbegan inculcating the Earth. Skeptics say that it’s the other way around:astrologers merely gave the new planet some of the more current and endemicattributes of our changing world. Yet under synchronicity, these are the samething.Pluto is a camouflaged planet, an uncertainty planet, a placeholder for blackholes and artificial worlds. Its coyotl-like arrival in one of Tombaugh’s blinkswas enigmatic in a precisely Plutonian way. From its long, eccentric orbit itcontinues to rule metamorphosis, regeneration, resurrection, reincarnation, andmagnetism.While Uranus marks the onset of atomic power in the natural element uranium, andman-made neptunium follows on the elemental chart, the most dangerous of theelements released by man into the atmosphere, oceans, and life cycles isplutonium. It is the custodian of the discovery of atomic fission on Earth.Pluto dispenses earthquakes, tsunamis, epidemics, world wars, nuclear accidents,and pole shifts. Its magicians are fakirs and yogis. Its honchos are sociopaths,warlords, terrorists, Mengeles.From its Underworld association, Pluto bears the horror and gloom of images thatare so deeply and collectively unconscious that we cannot get at them, or elsewe receive them only as nightmares, shapeless and shadelike, akin to deathitself.11 The lord of the Underworld travels the heavens with his boatmanCharon. “With his queen Persephone he held sway over the other powers of theinfernal regions, and over the ghosts of the dead. The symbol of his invisibleempire was the helmet that made men invisible.”12 Psychically, Pluto is a blackhole.Once the grim ritual behind the Nazi swastika was disclosed, astrologersdiagnosed Hitler’s reign as an epitome of negative Plutonian influences comingto bear on Earth following Tombaugh’s revelation, i.e., horrific aspects thathad long been buried beneath human consciousness.13 The Nazi ritual was soinhuman and weird that it might well have come from Pluto or the uncharteddomain that astrological Pluto rules. It is where Aryan heavyweight Odin meetsand conspires with the alien Greys and Arcturians of UFO lore.Some occultists believe that, of all the massacres, genocides, and massslaughters on Earth, the Nazis’ transgressions alone were channeled fromextraterrestrials. Hannah Arendt’s recognition of “the banality of evil,” herumbrella rationale for the Holocaust, carries a vague subtext of off-planetsupervision and choreography (not to her, of course, but to me): the Holocaustis banal because it doesn’t support its own ritual; it doesn’t match or justifyits output; it doesn’t fit or belong here. Why Germans of the Weimar eraperformed such a ceremony we will never know, but the trance in which they actedspeaks to a hidden perturber or some other Kuiper Belt archetype.Pluto is mythologically the source of wealth and grain, each of which comesoriginally from the earth. His allies are amphibious animals, poison-bearers,ants, spiders, and hairy plants. Black diamonds and deep purple-blue stones—oranything undergoing metamorphosis (cocoons, stalactites, stones changingcolor)—are Plutonian.14Pluto’s cruelty and inexorability are part of the cosmic order, but he is acutting-edge paradigm shifter too. An eccentric planet, slightly out of thezodiac, passing slowly through each of its signs, he is the perfect agent formillennial and cataclysmic changes. Astrologer Ellias Lonsdale adds:The force of Pluto is like a force from a vast vast vast desert way way way outthere. Pluto is there to draw us into a greater universe. Like it’s the lastoutpost that keeps reinstilling us with a cosmic perspective and keeps takingaway our materialistic assumptions.15According to psychologist James Hillman, Pluto’s real message is neither Hitlernor spiders nor the planetwide deployment of atomic power, though these arePlutonian factors. It won’t be a mind-matter ray or psychic electricityeither—passing Plutonian manifestations. Pluto is the Great Abyss itself: avacancy, a lesion, a latency so deep that it cannot manifest as form in thisworld-age or even this cosmos. The planet is missing from its own sky, as theOlympian deity is pre-erased from Greek art—no figuration or likeness of himeven where he is known to abide. Pluto is an adumbration incapable ofcongealing, a fathomless shadow, a homunculus sealed behind its own cenotaph. Itis mystery of Nature itself, of existence and beingness. Pluto is the god ofexistentialism, the paradox of his own deletion, millennia before Sartre orDerrida.Hillman adds:All this “negative” evidence does coalesce to form a definite image of a void,an interiority or depth that is unknown but nameable, there and felt even if notseen. Hades is not an absence, but a hidden presence—even an invisiblefullness.16The despair of Pluto is inescapable, though we have set up our entire culture toevade it. In fact the prime motive of most terrestrial lives is to avoid anderadicate Pluto: have fun, be social, amass possessions, make small talk, fussover houses and cars and parties—in sum, to pretend Pluto doesn’t exist. And itdidn’t, for a long time.Our terrain has to shift because it is ephemeral and artificial. Before Plutoarrived, we inhabited a consensus landscape, waging the narrative of a lifethrough which we flattered and consoled ourselves. This was as true in ancientPersia and Egypt as it was during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It cameinto its own with the industrial revolution. At heart, we didn’t believe any ofit. We didn’t even really want it. Like Pluto, nothing was actually there.But don’t blame Pluto for our banality or brutality. Pluto is simply absence.Absence gets filled, whether by sourceless ceremonies or various actual andsymbolic punishments and prisons, by bottomless grief and everyday neurosis.Pick your level because Pluto is also sunyata, a Sanskrit term for lack ofinherent essence but also spaciousness, openness, wisdom, enlightenment, or,more precisely, the clarity at their intersection.When we come into contact or conjunction with Pluto in its 246.04–year orbitdwarfing a human lifetime, we experience the full, stark intensity of oursituation and dilemma, the prodigious emptiness and futility at the heart ofexistence. In Pluto, there is no hope, no possibility, no chance that we willever feel better. Pluto is terminal depression, the perdition of everything thatreassures us. It is that barren a world, that far from the Sun, that much inexile from the current hustings of the Solar System—and I don’t mean justastrophysically.All tiny, dark worlds leave mute and invisible footprints on our doorsteps andinside our hearths. They can be as negative as Nazi gas chambers or as positiveas the Resurrection of Christ. Under Pluto, it’s all the same because it isdoing the Great Work, only in 246–year plumbs—world enough and time to swing apendulum between Christianity and fascism more than once, to ride out anyhistory or meaning.The way to come out of Plutonian sorrow is to depart it by an entirely differentgate from the one by which you entered—as a different person. And that is notonly straightforward and available: it can be done without any drama or fuss assoon as one is willing. Passing through Pluto’s reality means a consciousnessshift, a transit to unfamiliar ground. What is habitual and unconsciouslyreassuring can no longer exist on Pluto, for Pluto alters outright, and the onlyhope is to become its unknown thing.Resurrection is the point of Pluto anyway. It completes its cycle and takes offits yoke only when recognition of its sheer difference becomes more powerfulthan compulsive preoccupation with its emptiness.The moral: the ground we stand on is neither recreational nor social nor, forthat matter, does it have anything to do with who we tell ourselves we are.Those comprise the inner planets: fleeting solaces, symptomatic stages fordramas as we bide our time and await determination.Pluto gets to us and deepens us by wiping that slate clean, by locating us wherewe are actually standing, where we were originally rooted. It continually findsus pretending and makes us real. As it darns its way stealthily in and out ofNeptune’s orbit, it periodically touches bottom. It says: “What seems to behappening couldn’t be happening.” And it isn’t.Plutinos and Other Trans-Neptunian PlanetsPluto was a fully qualified if peewee planet until astronomers realized that itbelonged to a class of smaller trans-Neptunian objects that orbit the Sun atPluto’s distance and beyond. The celestial mechanic didn’t carefully line upfour gas and ice giants after four rocky planets (and rock-strewn asteroid belt)only to cap them with a single rocky body of equal status yet smaller thaneither Mercury or Mars. Pluto could stand as the outermost planet only as longas we were blind to a string of comparable worlds orbiting beyond it.Many folks have since lamented the demise of Pluto’s planetary status, for wehad gotten used to its pup-like yelp at the end of the solar roll call. Yet thiswas more street mythology than astronomy, with a bit of Walt Disney thrown in.There was even a brief dispute in the late twentieth century concerning whetherthe planet was named after Mickey Mouse’s dog rather than the monarch of theUnderworld, but Disney animators confirmed that the planet’s naming on March 23,1930, came several months before their rechristening of Rover (considered toocommon a brand at the time by company marketers). Pluto the pooch was notconsciously Lowellian either; it just popped into their minds, but it gave aslightly daffy closure to the Solar System, an antidote to the somber Roman god.Who would kick a cute mutt out of a nursery rhyme anyway? Yes, the names of theplanets are kind of a kindergarten pentameter, so the Solar System without Plutoseemed shorn of its last beat, its tail.Obviously it is more elegant to group trans-Neptunian dwarfs together, for thereare many similar-sized homunculi functioning as a second, backwoods lineuparound Sol, most of them with their own moons, and each taking 247 years orlonger to complete a solar orbit. Some of the worlds are even bigger than Pluto,another strike against granting it the closing slot in a sequence beginning withMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Yet Pluto’s demotion was not only a matter ofsize, as Mercury and Mars would be relegated to dwarf status if they orbited theSun beyond Neptune. It is size plus position plus historical context.If the dwarfs were all included in a planetary census, the Solar System wouldlose its concision as well as its traditional pantheon of deities. The dwarfworlds simply don’t belong at the same party as the rest. They don’t come fromSumeria or Greece or Rome, or even Galileo’s Italy; they are citizens ofmodernity: small digitalized rocks.In an email to me, poet Robert Kelly remarked that it was not the demotion ofPluto per se that concerned him as much as the hasty coronation of all thedwarfs, giving astrologers license to clutter their already-muddled charts (perasteroids, centaurs, and Plutomania) with fresh binges of mismatched fancies andfads, forfeiting the singularity and holism of the horoscope by aggrandizingnewcomers while depreciating pivots of more central and immediate orbs:My anxiety about the poor planetoid was funded more by a kind of wry remembranceof how the astrologers of the 1940s–1970s made such an important issue of Plutoin their reading of charts and their prognostications of new Eras of the world,etc. You remember. Now this new hierarchy, as you nicely call it, will invite acounty fair of stargazing speculations, and we’ll soon see horoscopes thick withthose little fellers and their moons. And maybe in fact they’ll get it allclearer than it has been. But I’m not sure how much the Sun and our Moon (ourmasters) care about them.Yet conversely, if Pluto were made an exception and kept the ninth planet to theexclusion of the other KBOs, it would be favoritism sans astronomical context.In addition, there is more than one “Pluto” (or plutino) traveling in Pluto’sorbital slot. A plutino is a KBO locked in a 2:3 mean-motion resonance withNeptune. For every two solar orbits that a plutino makes, Neptune makes three.So Pluto is a member of a gang that has been recruited by Neptune over the yearsusing 2:3, one of the strongest and most stable resonances in a universe run bycelestial mechanics. The Plutino groove is an attractive ride!Sixteen plutinos are bright enough to classify individually, though only threeof them have been deeded Earth names to go with their identification numbers.Beyond the sixteen, countless others that are more moonlet-like or meteoroidthan planetary don’t get serialized. In the long watches of astronomical time,Pluto has had to be careful not to bump into any of its co-orbiters, or maybe ithasn’t and that is why it travels outside the plane of the Solar System with somany small co-moons.Imagine another Earth and Luna orbiting the Sun at approximately 92.9 millionmiles but always on the other side of the ellipse. Numerous science-fictionwriters have plotted just such an arrangement. Anti-Earth could be entirelydifferent from Earth, a world of randomly drifting geological effects across alifeless tundra, hence a candidate for human colonization. But it could alsobear its own life forms, from a different biology and genetic molecule. It couldbe populated by humanoid tribes, speaking foreign languages, with differentbelief systems from us, and at their own stages of development. The inhabitantscould be either more or less advanced than concurrent Gaians, arriving here inalien spacecraft or being visited first. They could have martial traditions andimperial ambitions and come as conquistadors, but so could we. Or they could bescientists and diplomats. Of course, that is the dichotomy we imposed on ourother mythical twin, Mars, so it represents our ambivalence about our ownessential nature as well as life in the universe in general: a fallen angel or abeast with a territorial imperative.A few authors have tried to make Earth and Anti-Earth invisible to each other byplacing the Sun always between us. Disclosure of the latter’s existence wouldcome as a shock to us at some point in the future. I’m not sure if that sitingworks geometrically, and it certainly doesn’t gravitationally. At least twoauthors (that I know of) didn’t even bother to put the Sun between us. They justhad us be mutually unaware of each other’s presence for no reason other than theconvenience of their stories. In a 2011 movie based loosely on the latter trope(Another Earth), Anti-Earth is unexplained either orbitally or astronomically;it just arrives. The worlds then turn out to be identical to each other in everyway: they have all the same people and situations, until the moment that theirinhabitants learn of the others’ existence. From that point on, identical peopleon the two planets begin to deviate in small ways. So if you were responsiblefor something terrible happening on your “Earth,” you could travel to the otherand try to prevent or redeem it.In any case, NASA’s lunar missions established definitively, by changing theviewing angle, that there are no other “Gaias.” Anti-Earth remains amythological stand-in, though, for alternate realities.Most dwarf planets are not plutinos; they lie beyond the Pluto cluster orbitingthe Sun at a mean 247.3 Earth-years. There are too many of these trans-Neptunianobjects (more than forty notable ones by 2014) for me to cover them all—and newones are still being culled from the Kuiper Belt—so I will offer vignettes ofonly the major dwarfs, starting with the plutinos (though Kelly’s warning is aworthwhile one: do not snag or litter a chart with too many remote planets andinfluences; these crest beyond the range of most individuals, at least in thisincarnation).Furthermore, like Pluto itself and unlike the interior Solar System, KBOs canhave only transpersonal and karmic astrologies; they cannot leverage theirremote pulleys at a fulcrum of mundane personality or relationship. It would belike trying to use a crowbar in New York to lift a rock in Beijing. They do,however, tunnel under entire civilizations, pebble by pebble. Being far from theSun, they move very slowly relative to Earth, completing their orbits in spanswell beyond ordinary personal situations or even cohesive historical periods.Two hundred and forty-eight years ago Mozart was performing operas and Britainwas levying taxes on the thirteen colonies. We can tell the dwarf planets’meta-stories, but we can’t get at them otherwise. Our mortality is too brief.KBOs like asteroids tend to elucidate the astrologies of inner worlds. New toour zodiac, they are still depositing sigils and symbols, which are neither aspositive nor negative as they might seem in a first pass. Like Pluto, other KBOsjust take a long angle on human affairs. (Note too that the reign of solelyEuropean Graeco-Roman names ended at Pluto; the outer Solar System is fullymulticultural.)OrcusOrcus was discovered by astronomers Chad Trujillo and Mike Brown at theCalifornia Institute of Technology along with David Rabinowitz of YaleUniversity on February 17, 2004, but appeared retroactively on photographs dugup from 1951. Many KBO dwarfs similarly hid, unnoticed, on earlier plates. Orcusis named after the Etruscan god of the dead. With an orbit like Pluto’s of245.18 Earth-years, this plutino (the purest anti-Pluto) is at aphelion whenPluto is at perihelion and vice versa. Pluto and Orcus are mirrors reflectingeach other across the ecliptic. Orcus has a large moon emulating Pluto’s Charon,which was named Vanth after the winged psychopomp who guides the souls of thedead to the Underworld, the Etruscan deity most closely associated with theGreek ferryman of Hades. Orcus appears bright gray, indicating a good deal offrozen cryovolcanic water mixed with methane and ammonia. Because of Vanth,scientists were able to estimate the parent body’s mass as approximately that ofthe Saturnian moon Tethys. Orcus has a diameter of five hundred miles, Vanthabout 165 miles.In respect to their near-common orbits as they resonate astrologically, plutinostransmit a collective meaning set. Orcus specifies our perilous journey to thedepths of our being, beneath the collective unconscious, beyond even theoutlands represented by Pluto. It is where we will someday find an antidote toPluto in an actual, nonsymbolic underworld, so it is where we encounter why andhow beingness itself moved out of Eternity into Time. Orcus is the ultimatepurifier.IxionIxion is a plutino too—its orbital period is 249.95 years. Redder and brighterthan most KBOs, it passes below the ecliptic at perihelion as Pluto’s perihelionpasses above it, so the two worlds don’t encounter each other catastrophically.In astrology it governs matters of tyranny, confrontation, and particularly“malicious and deceptive power-plays between authoritarian figureheads, drawnout in long karmic-based scenarios.”17 Think Saddam Hussein and the Bush family;the Irish Republican Army and the Protestant Orange Order; the Netanyahus andYassir Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization; Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, andKim Jong-un in succession facing down the ruling parties of China, South Korea,and the United States. Each side gains its strength and obstinacy from theplacement of Ixion in the heavens.Based in institutional authority rather than spirit, Ixion champions allopathicmedicine’s artificial prolongation of life over homeopathy’s stimulation of thelife force. Ixion wants to keep the old order in power at the expense of whatmust come; it is the plutino that most fervently tries to extend materialism’sauthority past materialism’s capacity to hold a prerogative itself.HuyaThe biggest, brightest KBO next to Pluto at the time of its discovery in 2000,Huya turned out to be only about 272 miles in diameter, a roundish icy rock witha few bright dimples and an orbital period of 247.72 Earth-years. Identified byColombian astronomer Ignacio Ferrin, it was named after the rain and winter godof the Wayuu peoples of northern Colombia and northwest Venezuela—a spirit thatdwells beyond the Sun.Astrologically Huya pushes people to extremes and, like Pluto, doesn’t carewhether the deed is honorable or shameful. He is quick-witted, shrewd, and asstubborn as Ixion, yet much more risk-taking and generous, especially whengenerosity serves his purpose. Huya’s curious nature delves compulsively intohow stuff works down to minutiae. In sum, he oversees the transmutation of fixedpatterns from past lives into freer and more flexible expressions each next timearound. According to online KBO astrologers, actress/host Oprah Winfreyincarnated a high dose of Huya energy: motivation of others, capacity for innerand outer change, the karma of the rainmaker.VarunaVaruna, a 643-miles-diameter trans-Neptunian object unperturbed by Neptune, wasdiscovered by Robert S. McMillan at the University of Arizona in 2000; it orbitsthe Sun at 43 AUs in a near-circular course with a period of 283 Earth-years.Named after the Hindu deity of the oceanic and heavenly waters and the guardianof immortality, Varuna oversees our eventual return to cosmic law and thesacredness of life.Varuna is also a sublimation of Jupiter, translating Jovian satiety and jollityinto a kind of transcendental generosity with occasional relapses intomegalomaniac narcissism. Alternately beneficent and malign, Varuna participatedin the Parisian peace treaty ratifying the existence of the United States(conjunct the Sun, 1773), the assassination of President John F. Kennedy(transiting Pluto in exact opposition to natal Varuna, 1963), and therecognition of AIDS (conjunct the Sun, 1981).18HaumeaHaumea was detected by team Brown in 2005 and named by him after the Hawaiiangoddess of childbirth and fertility who had pieces torn off her body; thesedeveloped into her children: fire lady Pele, sea goddess Namaka, and Hi’iaka,the deity of hula dancers. Haumea’s orbital period is 285 Earth-years, justbeyond Varuna. Assisted by Makemake, she is perhaps the most karmic of the KBOs,heralding the tiny chunk of our civilization that will survive the current epochand beget the next phase of consciousness on Earth. As such, she governs theHawaiian Sovereignty Movement, the break-up of the United States, the regainingof Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California by Mexico, and the kahunaprinciple behind the election of Barack Obama (though not his presidency).About seven hundred miles in diameter and one of the weirdest objects in theSolar System, astronomical Haumea is a solid irregular rock with a thin glaze ofwater ice. Unlike other KBOs, it is ellipsoidally elongated like a rugbyfootball, its major axis twice as long as its minor one. It also rotates veryrapidly and has a higher-than-expected density and bright water-ice albedo.Haumea sports two moons named after Hawaiian goddesses: Hi’iaka (217 miles indiameter with an orbit of forty-nine days) and Namaka (105 miles in diameterwith an orbital period of eighteen days). This outlier dwarf is presumed to bethe largest sheared-off survivor of a Kuiper Belt collision, which likelyfissioned its moons too, as there is little surplus debris that far out in theSolar System. Though the impact occurred billions of years ago, Hi’iakacontinues to perturb the motion of Namaka, the two moons oscillating on the edgeof an 8:3 resonance, alternately getting caught and then escaping it over theaeons.QuaoarQuaoar is a rocky KBO, spotted in the constellation Ophiuchus on June 4, 2002,by Brown and Trujillo. It appeared on a Palomar Observatory plate in 1954 butwas not identified as a “planet.” It has one moon and, similarly to Varuna,orbits in a near-circular path just beyond Varuna and Haumea at roughly the same43 AUs with little axial inclination and a period of 286 Earth-years.Quaoar is named for the creation god of the Tongva, the native people of LosAngeles (from which the world was sighted). At the time it was the largest novel“planet” since Pluto (six hundred to eight hundred miles in diameter, aboutone-third Pluto’s size), but it has since been surpassed by Eris, Sedna, Haumea,and Makemake. Astrologically Quaoar regulates esoteric teachings from outsidehuman consciousness as well as the coming shift in our relationship to thecosmos and our own egohood: away from individuality and toward multipersonhoodand group souls. It is an attendant of indigo children, spiritually advancedreincarnates who manifest on Earth from elsewhere, often as autistic sages oridiot savants, their arrival meant to ground the creative power of Quaoar’sDivine Chaos on Earth following Pluto’s orgy of decadence, materialism, anddecay.19 Indigos take no prisoners; they have no sales pitch or a plan: they dowhat they do and it’s up to everyone else to figure it out and pick up thepieces. It’s not their fault that no one tried to get away with this sort ofstuff before. They are conditioned only by what they absolutely know, not byauthority or prevailing attitudes. Autism is precisely that: as totally open toanything as it is totally closed to anything else.MakemakeMakemake, discovered by Brown’s Caltech team on March 31, 2005, is abouttwo-thirds the size of Pluto. In the populous Kuiper Belt, all the dwarf planetscollect tiny satellites except Makemake, so there is no yardstick by which toestimate its mass. A minus-470-degree-Fahrenheit iceball of methane, ethane, andnitrogen, it is presently (2015) just about at its aphelion of 53 AU with anorbital period of 309.88 Earth-years.Named after the creator god of the Rapanui people of Easter Island, Makemakeoperates astrologically in concert with Haumea and is associated withutilitarian derivations of nature and fertility, both benefic and malefic. Thelatter includes biotechnology so, at its best and most prophetic, Makemake isthe planet guiding us not only into but through the afflictions of Monsanto,Syngenta, and Dow Chemical, ideally into vital permacultures beyond. Evencorporate abominations are sacred in origin and have spiritual freedom to createtheir own universes. Only the god responsible for incarnating these malignantforms can dissolve and transform them, for the universe ultimately needs all itsfrequencies. Like Quaoar, Makemake oversees the entry of indigo children.ErisOrbiting the Sun erratically from 38 to 98 AUs every 557 years, Eris, at 1,450miles’ diameter, is the largest dwarf planet and the ninth-largest body in theSolar System after Mars, Ganymede, and Mercury (six, seven, and eight,respectively). It and its moon are also presently the most distant known objectsin the Solar System. When Eris was discovered by Brown and crew on January 5,2005, he almost named the gray methane world Xena after the fictional warriorqueen and then almost named it Persephone, but that tragic goddess had beendibsed by an asteroid. Instead, the new orb was identified as the goddess ofstrife and discord. Dysnomia, lawlessness, is the Eridian moon.Persephone is astrologically correct too. The daughter of Demeter, protector ofagriculture and fertility, she was snatched by Pluto, ruler of the Underworld,through a crack in the Earth’s mantle during an earthquake. In swallowing fourof her abductor’s pomegranate seeds, she obligated herself to spend four monthsof the year in his kingdom, Queen of Homeric Hades, overseer of the Gaianwinter.As the dwarf-planetary sublimation of Mars, Eris is “very strong, volatile, andvicious”; she hates to be left out of anything, especially good old fracases andbrouhahas. Acting as psycho as the situation allows, she is the last god toleave the battlefield, as she feeds off the mayhem and madness of destructionwhile having the best time of all.20 No wonder she was almost named Xena.As far out as she travels, Eris opens the next gateway or Source Dimension: thequest of the individual soul as human spirit, for its true nature. In theconjunction of Pluto and Eris (December 16, 1756, with an extended footprintfrom 1755 to 1758), it deposited an early clue to Earth’s new direction—not somuch the arrant French and Indian War or Russian invasion of Berlin as somethingcamouflaged beneath the return of Halley’s comet and the first lighthouse andlightning rod. Eris/Persephone is the aspect of the soul that we now most need,the cipher to open materialism’s gate into what matter actually is. Ultimately,as the feminine side of Mars, she will teach us how to neutralize his martialaspects in ourselves, maybe even end war forever.Humanity must break with its cult of materialism before it can turn swords intoploughshares, because to flip weapons of “mass destruction” into windmills,solar panels, teleportation devices, cold fusion, and remoteviewing machinesrequires nothing less than collective human telekinesis. As things presentlystand, humanity has substantially abandoned all internal sources of knowledgeand guidance, especially those that come from love, clairsentience, andintuition, in favor of simply blasting its way through matter with moreingenious machineries devised by mathematicians and engineers under thesponsorship of more and more impenetrable political systems run by robber baronsand their propagandists and lobbyists. The leaders of our species no longerbelieve in solutions derived from the heart, the third eye, and the aura—or thatthese are not only more effective ultimately than machines but are the latencyfrom which machines originated, before they began making themselves. When wegive over our greater powers to a constabulary of mere objects, we forfeit ourKuiper Belt heritage and destiny. Only a force leveraging the system from as farout as Eris can get deep enough into the human unconscious to find the buriedkeys and annul the present quarantine.As unbearably combative and entitled as Eris gets, using every ounce of herappanage to dethrone Pluto, she ultimately brings the cosmos’s decisive gift toEarth, though I can’t imagine what that is. “In the universe, there are thingsthat are known, and things that are unknown, and in between, there are doors.”21Eris is a door.SednaMeandering between 76.36 and 937 AUs in a long, highly elongated orbit of 11,400Earth-years and nearly as red as Mars, Sedna is momentarily closer to the Sunthan Eris but, on its oblong course, will pass its neighbor sentry in 2114, atwhich point Sedna will be the farthest presently known “planet” orbiting Sol.Sedna was discovered by Mike Brown and two associates on November 14, 2003.About 620 miles in diameter, it is the fifth-largest dwarf (after Eris, Pluto,Makemake, and Haumea) as well as a scattered-extended object, meaning that ithas been positioned ellipsoidally not by Neptune or Uranus but some unknowncelestial factor: perhaps a passing star hundreds of millions of years ago orthe hidden perturber of Neptune and Pluto. The ice giants merely refine Sedna’sorbit.Even as I finish this book, new dwarf worlds are being discovered in thecometary cloud, bodies large enough and of suitable composition for their owngravity to mold them spherically—the baseline qualification for planethood.These Oort orbs are so faint—close to pure stealth bodies given how littlesunlight they reflect—astronomers now believe that naturally camouflaged worldsas large as Mars and Mercury (and perhaps Earth too) likely abound at the edgeof the Solar System. We may yet find Planet X, in single or multiple form.In March 2014, Trujillo announced 2012 VP113; it is 280 miles wide with anapparent orbit between 80 and 452 AUs. Astrologies for it and other,undiscovered outer worlds are forthcoming; all we can know for sure—and this isa good thing, in fact the only reason that Earth has a chance—is that we don’tyet get the full picture: our full picture or its full picture or how the two ofthem coalesce. Each new planet, even undiagnosed, is an inkling, an indicationof a radically evolving human situation. I would guess that one shared aspect ofthese dwarfs, considering their bare literal reality, is to bring us intocontact with the rest of the universe, in all its dimensions, frequencies,intelligences, and planes. They are our future keys, telegraphically and inevery telepathic and telekinetic sense too.Just as 937 AU is a big nut to turn, Sedna itself wheels a cosmology well beyondour reckoning. Yet there are hints. As a member of the inner Oort Cloud, itseals the zone between the Oort itself and worlds beyond, esoterically. Sedna isthe “local” guardian of fractals as well as the crossroads between conflict andemptiness, between all arguments within and among events in the Solar System andthe non-argument beyond the Solar System in which the System is premised. As ameta-planet, Sedna is the link between the heart chakra of the inner worlds andthe twelfth chakra of outer trans-Neptunian objects. The warmest it gets onSedna is minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit.Sedna is the Inuit goddess of the deep sea and marine animals and the queen ofthe Eskimo Underworld wherein she is known alternately as Big Bad Woman andSkeleton Woman. The designants derive from her primordial confrontation with herfather, who became so enraged with her that he threw her off a cliff into theocean where fish ate out her flesh and eyes.In another version, Sedna marries Raven and is domiciled by him on a desolateisland. When her father comes to visit her, he grows angry at her shabbytreatment and intercedes and tries to take her back, but as they are fleeing inhis kayak, Raven causes such a terrible storm that Sedna’s father, to save hisown life, throws his daughter overboard. She clings to the kayak with her hands,so he cuts them off with his knife. Falling into the sea, they become fishes,whales, and seals. Handless, she sinks to the bottom.In both versions, after lying in the mud for aeons, she is mistakenly pulled upby a fisherman who intrudes into her enchanted inlet. As he hooks her rib cage,the rest of her follows like puppet strings, and she is scooped into his net, acracked skeleton still bearing long tangled hair. Crustaceans have formed on herteeth, and coral creatures live in her eye sockets. Terrified by what he hasraised to the surface, the fisherman tries to fling it back in the ocean, butthe bones, caught in his net, won’t come loose and are dragged along behind himas he paddles frantically and then races in zigzags across the snowpack. Sheends up in his igloo.Gradually overcoming his fear and loathing, he feels compassion for this beingand begins to pay attention to her and her plight. He wraps furs around herskeleton to warm it and then painstakingly restores her bones in their properorder from the toes up. He combs out her hair.Then he falls into a deep sleep during which he cries a single tear. Crawlingpassionately toward this droplet, Sedna laps it up. There is so much liquid inthe tear that she keeps drinking and drinking until she has quenched her longthirst. After this quaff she looks into the fisherman’s chest, finds his heartand extracts it, and, using it as a drum, beats out a rhythm to which shesupplies words: “Flesh, Flesh, Flesh! Flesh, Flesh, Flesh!”The aria restores tissues to her bones, eyes to her sockets, hands to her radii.As she continues to beat and chant, she grows breasts and a vagina. Then shesings the clothes off the fisherman and reaches back into his chest, where shereturns the drum so that he has a beating heart. She presses her full womanlylength against him, falls asleep, and they awake in the morning tightlyentwined.22In 2009 I met a fairly convincing alien in a dream who told me, after I askedhim whence: “Orion. Actually one of the stars in what you scope as Orion.”I stared at him for a long time before deciding he was real. Then I set beforehim the crucial riddle: “How did you get here? You had to beat the speed oflight, right?”“Light is not,” he beamed, “my measure. We have something called”—and I forgetthe acronym, maybe BLIP or FLIB—“it transfers information, and then I comealong. First I put my data into your system; then I instantaneously appear.”“Is it like remote viewing,” I wondered, “only remote super-positioning?”“It is,” he said. “But what I actually do is more complicated and stranger thanyou are assuming. The trick is to get from your kind of physics to mine. Also Ihad to discover this place in the atlas of worlds in order even to know itexisted; then I sent my coordinates ahead.”He didn’t say that or even give that speech, but it is a fair rendering.As I lost touch with his semblance, I felt the hefty premise of his greatscience against our world’s colossal blundering. I did not get to ask him why hehad undertaken his trip or what he thought would be our outcome.The next night, though, I woke from a dream with his ambiance inside me and thefollowing message about the stations of our System:Mercury: Information portal and entry strip for transdimensional travelVenus: Electromagnetic node and operational symbol for the postpetroleum era ofGaian civilizationEarth: Alchemy then, alchemy now, alchemy foreverMars: The ancient past of our Solar System with its pre-Egyptian, pre-LemuriancivilizationsJupiter and its moons: The life forms, consciousness, and buddhas of the futureSaturn and its moons: The unknown—beyond all life forms and imagined life forms,beyond all worlds and imaginable worldsUranus and its moons: The beginning of the absolute next thing, the eternalreturn of this thing transmogrified and altered by moving one critical atom atits coreNeptune and its moons: Peace, peace forever, peace at lastPluto and Charon, the Kuiper Belt, the Oort Cloud: Communication and commercewith the rest of the universeNotes1.

HOAGLAND[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_001_r1.jpg]Figure 1. The New Horizon Mission is humankind’s first modern visit to Pluto—thelast “classic” planet of the solar system. In this Mission artwork, thespacecraft is depicted as “eclipsing” the distant sun … a “coded” clue to theHD/Torsion Physics the New Horizons spacecraft will be quietly measuring as itflies through the unique Plutonian system of a true “double planet” … orbited by(at least) four “harmonic” moons.…When Richard Grossinger initially asked me to consider contributing to thisunusual volume, in anticipation of NASA’s first unmanned mission to Pluto(called New Horizons—finally flying by the controversial “ninth planet” thissummer), I remember that my first response went something like—“But how does Pluto—a tiny, demoted ‘ball of ice’ (no longer even consideredofficially ‘a planet’)—fit into our decades-long Enterprise investigations intothe profound possibility, growing more certain with every new ‘leaked’ NASAritual and image, that ‘an ancient, highly-advanced ET civilization’ a long timeago systematically remodeled the entire solar system—with us as the eventualresult!?”This chapter is the surprising answer to Richard’s invitation.With appropriate homage to James Hilton and Frank Capra,1 our “lost horizon” andthe “new horizon” that is about to overtake it encompass some remarkable andsurprising parallels to their 1930s classics:In the 1937 film adaptation, the idyllic valley of perpetual peace, youth, andperfection—Shangri-La2—is depicted as a timeless mountain valley refuge,deliberately placed high amid the “impenetrable Himalayas,” to attempt, if allelse fails, preservation of its priceless archive of “ancient human knowledge”against the relentless tide of another global war.That fictional “Lost Horizon” scenario is, in fact, an eerie echo of the resultsof our own, now decades-long, Enterprise Mission investigations regarding thegrowing probability of a “totally remodeled, ancient solar system” whose all butgodlike “ET knowledge and accumulated wisdom” may have been preserved—acrossmillions of years—in a series of “dedicated archives” cached across that ancientsolar system.Including the one most likely to have survived—at Pluto.The Enterprise Mission, across more than thirty years, has published3 a varietyof increasingly compelling evidence supporting these radical ideas—that thisentire solar system, somehow in the dim and distant past, was deliberately“rearranged” to ultimately support the development of human intelligence … andeventually human civilization itself.First outlined in 1987 (The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever),4the academic science behind this far-reaching Enterprise hypothesis seems tohave finally, quietly, caught up.Recent peer-reviewed astronomical observations and analysis—stemming from NASA’srevolutionary Kepler space telescope “exo-planetary” observations of the numbersand types of “super-earth planets” found orbiting even “nearby, sun-likestars”5—have reached a startling “mainstream” conclusion:It seems clear that our [own] Solar System—which contains no planet interior toMercury’s P = 88 day orbit—did not participate in a major if not the dominantmode of planet formation in the Galaxy …Super-earths [planets in the range of five to ten times the Earth’s mass] arenot anomalous; they are the rule that our Solar System breaks. In a sense, theburden of explaining planetary system architectures rests more heavily on theSolar System [now] than on the rest of the Galaxy’s planet population at large[emphasis added].6Britain’s Daily Mail, reporting on this same revolutionary astronomicaldevelopment, was more direct:7In the last 20 years, reports Nature8 … it may even be that our solar system isfairly unique when compared to other [Galactic …] planetary systems [emphasisadded].This, of course, is blatant scientific heresy, standing against over half amillennium (since Copernicus) of emphatic and repeated scientific assertionsthat the Earth (and its parent solar system) must be “relentlessly average” (themost often cited example of the so-called “Copernican,” or MediocrityPrinciple)9.The fact that NASA has now discovered (and publicly admitted!) that the solarsystem, for unknown reasons, does not follow science’s “prime mediocritydirective”—and is now being viewed by more and more astronomers as anything but“average”—only foreshadows a much larger revolution to come.This dawning paradigm shift—that there is something uniquely “wrong” (or,right!) about this solar system, compared to almost all the thousands of otherscurrently known—after two decades of “exoplanet” observations, in our opinion,takes our thirty-year-old Enterprise idea of a possible Type II Civilization“re-arrangement” of this early solar system from being merely “a far-outpossibility” to the level of another scientifically-testable “model.”A hypothesis that could turn out to be “the explanation” for the series ofextraordinary solar system and exo-solar system discoveries that NASA (and theother international space agencies) have quietly … secretly … been finding andthen rigidly suppressing—for more than fifty years.There are verifiable remains, scattered all around us in the solar system, of astunning Type II Kardaschevian civilization;10 hundreds of millions of yearsafter radically rearranging the entire “original” size and spacing of theplanets and moons orbiting the Sun (as in “Bode’s Law,” et al.), thiscivilization was murdered through a series of cataclysmic, literally“world-shattering” interplanetary wars. From this destruction, a few pricelessfragments—across countless ensuing millennia—have been carefully handed downthrough time by each “high civilization” that successively rose up, like theoriginal Egyptian phoenix, culminating now (on Earth) with us.It is these sacred, deeply-sequestered “ancient ET archives”—as we have arguedelsewhere11—that are now revealed, from our continuing analysis, to have formedthe underlying “hidden guidance” behind NASA’s entire first fifty years ofpioneering manned and unmanned exploration of the solar system!Each successive NASA mission over that “Golden Age” of intensive exploration wasselected, we have shown, not primarily for its “potential to advance mainstream‘geological planetary models,’” as NASA has always flatly claimed, but as partof a larger reconnaissance of a secret … sacred … ancient list of long-abandonedET spacecraft and planetary ruins, to be scrutinized by a series of key NASA“cover” missions. These missions have revealed startling close-ups ofmiles-wide, war-shattered, still outgassing fragments of that once godlike TypeII Civilization’s ancient space fleet—indistinguishable, to pre-space agegenerations of Earth-bound astronomers, from all the other interplanetary“asteroids and comets.”Our research has now revealed that this stunning, new solar system reality firstbecame known to the U.S. Department of Defense under the EisenhowerAdministration in the 1950s—in part via a pioneering, top secret JPL (U.S. Army)effort at a first unmanned circumlunar reconnaissance mission, “Project RedSocks.” We believe the shocking results of this clandestine mission formed thereal reason behind NASA’s sudden public emergence after Sputnik, and the rapidcongressional authorization, only one year later in 1958, of NASA as theloudly-proclaimed, lead “civilian space agency of the United States of America.”This was the perfect cover—in the 1950s world of perpetual Soviet pursuit of anyand all technological supremacy over the West—for NASA’s real, long-term covertmission:To secretly ascertain … from NASA’s inception … the full extent and (potential)military threats (or benefits) of these long-abandoned, ancient ET derelicts,still endlessly “falling around the sun,” as well as those ancient surfaceinstallations still partially preserved on various planets and moons (Cydonia etal.); the surviving riches of an entire, astonishing Type II Civilization in ourown backyard—whose extraordinary legacy and scientific potential was only fullyaccepted (even within NASA) when Apollo astronauts fulfilled their real KennedyMission and clandestinely returned, beginning in 1969, unquestionableintelligently-designed and manufactured ET artifacts to Earth—from the Moon.A “program … within a program … within a program”—all carried out in plainsight—under the rigidly repeated NASA mantra: “the Agency is only pursuing acivilian lunar and planetary science program.”“Stargate: SG-1,”12 anyone?[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_002_r1.jpg]Figure 2. Artist depiction of a “cold, sunny day on Pluto” with Pluto’s onelarge moon, Charon, looming just ~12,000 miles away through an ultra-thin,ultra-frigid (~-380–degree F.) atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and carbonmonoxide, outgassed recently from Pluto’s perpetually frozen landscape.Pluto—formerly the ninth planet—was confirmed as an official new member of thesolar system on a cold February night in 1930, on a mountain plateau in northernArizona, by a young twenty-three-year-old former Kansan amateur astronomer namedClyde Tombaugh13 (that little “dust up”14 over at the International AstronomicalUnion as to whether Pluto is a “planet” notwithstanding; we’ll get to a possiblereal reason for the very curiously timed, and totally unnecessary controversy,later).Tombaugh, a self-confident but quiet young farmer, financially prevented by cropfailure from entering college to pursue a career in astronomy, had mailed hisown astronomical drawings—particularly of Mars and Jupiter—to the LowellObservatory for “review” anyway in 1928. To his surprise, as a result of thisMidwestern initiative (combined with genuine talent), Tombaugh was immediatelyhired by the Observatory’s director—Vesto Slipher—to carry out a “mission.”Tombaugh’s “mission impossible”: to promptly “resume a systematic photographicsearch for a possible ‘ninth planet of the solar system,’” initially started byLowell’s founding director, Percival Lowell himself, in 1905.The original Lowell Observatory search program15 had been based on telescopicmeasurements Lowell painstakingly carried out of the orbital position of theouter “gas-giant planets,” Uranus and Neptune, as compared to their calculatedephemeris positions—after Uranus’s (and all the other planets’) slight,competing gravitational attraction on Neptune had been carefully factored in.The two didn’t match.Which meant, according to standard (Newtonian) interpretation, there had to be a(still unseen) “new” planet out there … somewhere—a “gravitational perturber”tugging more strongly on Uranus and Neptune than on the rest of the known solarsystem—a genuine “ninth planet.” Based on his observed “Neptune and Uraniandiscrepancies,” Lowell later wrote that he immediately began calculating whereon the celestial sphere an unseen planet “of about six Earth masses”—which hecalled Planet X—might lie.Twenty-four years later, Clyde Tombaugh—the enthusiasticamateur-turned-professional at Lowell—would finally, quietly, vindicate Lowell’samazingly predictive calculations.16[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_003_r1.jpg]Figure 3. Original Lowell Observatory press announcement of Clyde Tombaugh’s1930’s confirmation of Percival Lowell’s 1905 “ninth planet prediction.”The name Pluto was announced three months after Tombaugh’s historic discoveryphotographs were verified, in May, 1930; the story of the time was that “aneleven-year-old girl in England, Venetia Burney, connected to Oxford Universitythrough her grandfather, a retired Oxford librarian,” was able to get a “cable”(telegram) to Tombaugh in Flagstaff just days after the discovery announcement,”urging him to “name his new discovery ‘Pluto’ … for mythological reasons.”17As the story continues, Tombaugh liked it … and “the rest is history”; the addedadvantage being that the first two letters—PL—“in code,” also commemoratedPercival Lowell.In an important reinforcement of “the symbolic overtones” to Pluto’s discoveryconfirmation story, evidence has emerged that purported “33rd Degree Freemason,”Walt Disney18—creator of the most popular animated animal and cartoon charactersof all time—having launching a planned new “canine character” (in the fall of1930), within months of Pluto’s discovery and naming suddenly changed the nameof his new dog (from “Rover” in 1930 … to “Pluto” in 1931)19—to take “deliberateadvantage of the public’s obvious, overwhelming interest in the new planet.”Thus, Pluto—soon, the new “top dog” of pop film culture around the world—wasalso subliminally, inextricably “imprinted” in the public mind (through theDisney “media machine”) as that new “‘doggy’ planet” … a celestial “canineconnection” that was an obvious echo of a much more ancient, much more powerfulcelestial canine meme: the original Egyptian worship of the “dog star” (Isis)herself: Sirius.“Symbolic memes” and NASA’s repeated “inexplicable obsession with Egyptianmythology” aside, unfortunately for Pluto’s long-term historic legacy, physicaldoubts regarding the new planet’s fundamental nature soon began emerging,despite Tombaugh’s initial, apparent triumphant vindication of Lowell’sdecades-old “ninth planet orbit calculations.”Independent telescopic observations coupled with rapidly developing astronomicaltechnology soon made it clear that the “Lowell/Tombaugh” Pluto was far too small(thus lacking the crucial gravitational field from not possessing enough mass)to have possibly created the “celestial mechanics errors” Lowell had reported inhis initial analysis of Uranus’s continued “anomalous orbital motion” (again,after the rest of the solar system’s known gravitational influence, particularlythat of Neptune, was carefully subtracted). These celestial mechanics anomalies,ostensibly, were the entire observational basis for Lowell initiating his own1905 “high-profile, formal launch of a Lowell Observatory search for a ninthplanet!”20So—If Lowell’s measured outer planet discrepancies turned out to be “so wrong,” howdid he still get the answer, regarding the location of Pluto decades later, soright!?; how did Lowell successfully predict the celestial position of a small(ultimately, as it turned out, 1,400-mile-wide) “snowball,” at least fourbillion miles away, fifteen years ahead in time? An object which could notpossibly (from a wide variety of modern astronomical measurements and subsequentanalyses) have generated the “anomalous gravitational effects” on Uranus andNeptune that Lowell reportedly initially measured?; that he specifically(according to his notes) incorporated into this bafflingly “correct” (even ifnow proven mathematically wrong) “discovery position” for Pluto?Was there, in fact, more to Lowell’s “impossibly” successful prediction thanwe’ve been told?Current academic astronomy casually dismisses Lowell’s fifteen-year predictionof Pluto’s distant location as “just a lucky coincidence”:The question arises … why is there an actual planet moving in an orbit which isso uncannily like the one predicted? … There seems no escape from the conclusionthat this is a matter of chance. That so close a set of chance coincidencesshould occur is almost incredible, but the evidence employed by Brown permits ofno other conclusion [emphases added].—RICHARD RUSSELL, Princeton astronomer, 193021, 22This “religious” academic approach (it has to be “chance”) obscures the realissues nagging Lowell’s uncanny 1915 Planet X calculations for over a hundredyears: What if his correct prediction wasn’t “just an incredibly luckyaccident?”; what if there was a third explanation?If, as has been shown, “the laws of gravity” totally rule out the current“Pluto” as being, at all, physically responsible in any way for Lowell’spublished Uranian/Neptunian discrepancies, then the only rational (ifpolitically unacceptable) third remaining explanation for Lowell’s astonishing“success,” would be if he (Lowell) literally made up the “Neptunian/Uraniananomalies!So—He could quietly “insert” a new, real planet (read “Pluto”) in the outer solarsystem … in the correct orbital location … ultimately to be “found” by anyonefollowing Lowell’s carefully planned (but—in this theory—deliberatelymisleading) “Neptunian/Uranian discrepancies”—which was “necessary” (in thistheory) if Lowell was to successfully hide his real “off-world source” for suchan astonishing, bona-fide solar system addition!An authentic ET archive.In fact, it is quite reasonable to propose that Lowell—as a very“well-connected” Boston “Brahmin”23 who had personally lived in the Orient formany years, who had thoroughly cultivated a wide variety of local contacts inthe secular and temple communities (writing several best-selling volumes in theprocess on a variety of Asian subjects, which are now credited with “opening upearly twentieth-century American appreciation/awareness of the loomingimportance of the Far East”)—may also have gained, as “a well-known Americanamateur astronomer … with money,” privileged access to an “Asian version” ofthat proposed “secret … ancient … sacred … ET solar system list!”A list on which a future “Pluto” (and its critically important, currentcelestial position —an accurate “planetary ephemeris”) was, in the model,quietly preserved—plainly identified, perchance, as “housing a rare, survivingsolar system Ancient Archive … connected with a, now-extinct, ancientcivilization once spanning the entire solar system … including, ruins stillvisible on Mars.”The existence of such a mind-boggling list … or Lowell’s proposed “secretaccess,” notwithstanding, what is historically indisputable is that PercivalLowell suddenly, dramatically, returned to Boston in 1893—after ten years ofcontinuously living and writing in the Far East—and immediately began refocusinghis “entire wealth and managerial genius” on “The Heavens.”Along the way, he created (in less than a year) the first university-grade (butindependently private) American “Lowell Observatory”—located, for the firsttime, thousands of miles away from the East Coast centers of “academic science,”especially Boston—in the “Great American Southwest” amid the high,“astronomically perfect” mountains of northern Arizona.And, unlike the demonstrated “polymath” he’d been throughout his entire previouscareer(s)—“shrewd investor … skilled photographer and scientificartist … inspired public speaker … and immensely popular adventure-travelwriter”—Percival Lowell, on abruptly, radically, changing his entire life fromall that he’d been previously, for some extraordinary personal reason decided todevote his last two decades to one thing and one thing only—Mars.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_004_r1.jpg]Figure 4. Percival Lowell eloquently compares the “saffron Martian deserts” heis seeing through his specifically-designed 24-inch telescope, when he points itat Mars, to those same “saffron hues” surrounding his Southwest mountaintopobservatory on “Mars Hill,” looking down on Flagstaff, Arizona.Lowell began a single-minded visual and photographic search, painstakinglypursued over decades … for scientific evidence of “Life on Mars”; a searchmorphing (in his last decade) into a parallel (but, as you will see, equally“obsessive,” if potentially connected) search for “the location of a [thenuncertain] ninth solar system planet.”This raises the crucial question: What (if anything) was Lowell physically shownin Japan to make him rush home and begin (literally) a whole new life—that gavehim such conviction regarding what was really waiting for humanity on Mars … ifnot beyond?And, did Lowell’s unshakable scientific certitude on these two issues—Mars andPluto—as our years of Enterprise analysis now concludes, stem from the same,“ancient (ET) ‘sacred’ solar system sources” as NASA’s … only decades earlier!?;did Lowell, in fact, deliberately “leak” these two new, major clues about aninhabited ancient solar system from this “ancient, secret list”?Perhaps as part of a larger, clandestine political effort in the early twentiethcentury—aimed, worldwide, by a whole group of “renegade intellectuals”—atforcing an eventual “democratization of all ancient solar system knowledge andinformation” held secretly, for countless previous millennia, by “the elites”?The first “Disclosure Project?”Was this why there was such an overwhelmingly negative, organized “academicbacklash” against Lowell’s late-nineteenth-century/early-twentieth-century Marsobservations, and certainly his relentless pursuit of Martian “life?” Thesecontroversies (if possible) only escalated around Lowell’s sudden decision toalso search for Planet X. And they ultimately led, in 2006, to the very planethe had successfully, mathematically predicted decades before being deliberately,politically “demoted” … just as it was finally about to be robotically explored.In this most recent “Lowell humiliation”—the highly public political “demotion”of Pluto—was Percival Lowell being “publicly punished” once again … because, asan insider, he “broke the Ultimate Rule?” Was this the real reason whyPluto—suddenly, after decades as the solar system’s official “ninth planet”—wasinstitutionally “dethroned” to being just one of “thousands of so-called“dwarf-planets” orbiting just beyond Neptune’s 30 AU orbit in what is called theKuiper Belt?[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_005_r1.jpg]Figure 5. The so-called “Kuiper Belt” is a vast, donut-shaped ring consisting oftrillions of (newly-discovered in 1992) “icy-asteroids” of a range of sizes from“planetary” all the way down to “dust”—starting just beyond Neptune’s orbit (30AU) and extending out to about 50 AU. Pluto, because of its orbital positioningand the IAU “decision, was controversially “dethroned” (in 2006) from being theNinth Planet to being “just another member of the Kuiper Belt.”Was this sudden demotion of Pluto into being “just another Kuiper Belt Object”(by, in fact, just 4 percent of voting IAU members!) “coincidentally” just weeksafter a NASA mission finally got underway for the first close-up look in modernhistory at the last “classical” planet—in fact, just a thin, if not obviousattempt to begin reducing public interest in Pluto well before New Horizonsfinally got there? Again, this was perhaps part of a larger, continuingtwentieth/twenty-first-century academic effort to totally discredit everythingthat Percival Lowell ever discovered, because Lowell’s “source”—like NASA’s—wasultimately a forbidden “off-world archive?” Was this whole modern kerfufflearound Pluto, ultimately, simply because the Powers That Be felt Lowell neededto be made “a continuing Example”24 of what happens (even to “Brahmins”) whoreveal?[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_006_r1.jpg]Figure 6. Cover of CalTech astronomer Michael Brown’s “in your face” defense ofthe “dethronement of Pluto.”This curious (and totally disturbing!) pattern of “continuing Lowell’spunishment” seems to extend even beyond Lowell’s personal scientificachievements; the seminal “extra-galactic nebular observations” of VestoSlipher25 (Lowell’s personally appointed successor as director—and the same guywho would later hire Clyde Tombaugh to “resume Lowell’s ninth planet search”)have also been quietly “back benched” in history, by powerful “academicinterests” still politically opposed to Lowell.Slipher was the early twentieth century’s preeminent “astronomicalspectroscopist”—the term for an astronomer of the time who specialized instudying the chemical composition of and physical conditions surrounding large,nearby objects in space (such as the solar system’s other moons and planets) bycarefully analyzing how reflected sunlight is changed (imprinted) when itinteracts with their various surfaces or atmospheres.But planets are (relatively) bright objects, providing adequate light for suchinsensitive, early-twentieth-century “spectroscopic technology.”A key part of Slipher’s 1920s commission, after Lowell hired him for theObservatory, focused on extending such solar system “composition and physicalinformation studies” to galactic objects, thousands of times dimmer than thenearby planets. These “interstellar spectroscopic objects” included single (andmultiple) stars, galactic nebulae, cataclysmic objects (nova and supernova),etc.—and even (potentially) the ultimately mysterious (because they weresuspected, even then, of being extra-galactic) ghostly “spiral nebulae.”Slipher, in pursuit of these “cutting edge” astronomical observations forLowell, had to (literally) invent a totally new celestial science (andsupporting optical technology)—which would ultimately become the foundation of aradically new twentieth-century scientific discipline called astrophysics.But it would be George Ellery Hale26 (founder of the famed Mt. Wilsonobservatory high above Los Angeles, California), not Slipher, who wouldultimately receive “the scientific credit” for this fundamentaltwentieth-century astronomical revolution because of his innovativespectroscopic solar observations.Another deliberate slight against Lowell’s “people”?Slipher’s pioneering technological genius in “galactic spectroscopy,” and, as adirect consequence, his serendipitous and startling discovery of “anomalousspiral nebular redshifts”—as a singular result of his own major optical and filmimprovements—would become the observational foundation for the entire,subsequent Big Bang paradigm, of “receding galaxies and expandinguniverses!”—but, without as much as a hint from mainstream academia that allthis was based on Slipher’s prior, extra-galactic spectroscopic work … at thebehest of Lowell!By giving credit for these shatteringly important early galactic redshiftobservations (and, ultimately, even a “celebrity telescope!”) to Edwin Hubble(also at Mt. Wilson) and not to Vesto Slipher, the political winds of the time,in hindsight, seem pretty obvious: Lowell (and his Observatory) was never to bescientifically “acknowledged” again, nor were the folks who chose to pursuetheir own research under Lowell’s direction.This pattern of “extreme Lowell pettiness,” amazingly, seems to becontinuing … apparently, even extending to the current NASA New Horizonsmission! Enterprise has discovered that Clyde Tombaugh’s ashes have been quietlyincluded on the solar-system-escaping spacecraft27—a fitting beginning to his“post-life forever odyssey” in the Pharaonic tradition of “sailing the boat ofmillions of years … to one day ‘reach the imperishable stars,’” to, literally,cruise the galaxy forever aboard New Horizons … beyond Pluto.Percival Lowell’s ashes, pointedly, have not been so included.If those trying to “re-bury Lowell”—and Pluto with him—believe these tactics areworking, they need to think again; judging by the overwhelming publicfirestorm28 that erupted against Pluto’s “academic planetary banishment,” ifsomeone thinks just “calling Pluto by a different title,” or preventing Lowellfrom “returning to the stars … by leaving him buried in his lapis lazulimausoleum on Mars Hill” will have any diminishing effect on public interest inthe New Horizons mission—they should talk to Disney.There was, of course, one other, larger “conspiratorial” possibility to explainthis sudden, almost irrational “official war on Pluto” reaching its politicalclimax just after New Horizons launched: That the whole, high-profile “politicalexecution” of the ninth planet was actually intended to generate a totally fakecontroversy around “Lowell’s Pluto,” to deliberately write an “interplanetarysoap opera” so that by the time New Horizons does fly by this year, a lot morebloggers and consumers of social media (if not global TV networks and websiteslooking for more ratings) will be paying close attention to “the non-planet” andwhat is found there—if only because of the (soap opera) “controversialplanet/controversial astronomer” angle.Already, the “controversy angle” surrounding Pluto is being pushed in the mediaas new “focus groups” of scientists are polled as to whether the IAU decisionshould be reversed—and, surprisingly, the majority have voted that Pluto “shouldbe reinstated as a planet.”29“Science is nothing … if it’s not prediction.”Alan Stern—New Horizons’s principal investigator—has been firmly of the opinion,since 2006, that the IAU “made a terrible mistake in re-classifying Pluto.”30According to Stern, “The New Horizons’ Mission … will not recognize the IAU’splanet definition resolution of August 24, 2006” [emphasis added]. Does Sternsuspect (or know) the real reasons for Pluto’s abrupt demotion … a reason thatis, in fact, connected with his own (in our model) “clandestine Plutomission”—part of the larger, symbolic reason on this mission why Tombaugh’sremains could but Lowell’s ashes could not be included on New Horizons?Tombaugh’s photographic confirmation of Lowell’s Pluto orbit predictionsoccurred well over fifteen years before I was born; only after several moredecades, however, would I finally have the pleasure and distinct honor ofdiscussing “astronomy,” one whole afternoon, with Clyde Tombaugh—one of thebona-fide “astronomy icons” from my own growing up and growing scientificcuriosity—in person.Our conversation took place, appropriately, at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory,in southern California.It was Mars, that time, not Pluto, that had finally brought the two of ustogether in one auditorium: JPL’s “Von Karman, “joined by several hundred fellowreporters and planetary scientists; the occasion had been NASA’s historicunmanned Viking mission to Mars … to become the first “20th Century roboticartifact” to successfully “set an American footpad on the Red Planet,” thatmorning of July 20 in 1976.My meeting Tombaugh at JPL, just days after the amazing Viking I landing, was“icing on the cake” to having the once-in-a-lifetime experience of beingphysically present to observe, first-hand, modern Homo sapiens’s Mars Return.…Now, of course, I occasionally ask myself: Where would our afternoonconversation have gone … if what I know now about Mars, I had known then?That remarkable afternoon I spent with Tombaugh brought to an amazingsynchronicity a series of striking personal “nodal points” (as I have oftendescribed them) in my own life, all curiously involving “Mars”—that were set inmotion for me over a decade before when I went to work for the SpringfieldMuseum of Science, in Springfield, Massachusetts after successfully “passing” aprivate presentation I was requested to give to the museum director, in applyingfor the job. My chosen subject: Mars.But, in perhaps an even more remarkable “Mars coincidence,” one of the membersof the Springfield Museum Board of Trustees was Roger L. Putnam—PercivalLowell’s own nephew, and sole trustee of the Lowell Observatory for more thanforty years after Lowell’s passing; when the search for Lowell’s “ninth planet”almost died in the early decades of the twentieth century, after Lowell’suntimely death at sixty-one in 1916, it was Putnam who single-handedly revivedit over the strenuous legal objections of Lowell’s widow—even raising a crucialten thousand dollars from Harvard University for design and manufacture of a new“photographic telescope” that would one day “take the plates” on which Tombaughultimately confirmed “Lowell’s” Pluto.Looking back, it is now clear to me that it was Putnam’s persistent (if subtle)personal encouragement behind the scenes, after I met him one night at a museumreception for a new exhibit, culminating in the not-so-subtle gift of a signed,personal volume on “Mars and the Lowell Observatory,” that “helped me on thepath to Mars” at a seminal moment in my professional career, if not my life;that gave me the “institutional courage” to undertake my first “national Marsproject” at the Springfield Museum, in the summer of 1965, focused on “theimminent fly-by of the first NASA spacecraft to visit the Red Planet—Mariner 4.I called my first official museum exhibit and program “Mars: Infinity to 1965.”[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_007_r1.jpg]Figure 7. Springfield Museum of Science program book from its “Mars: Infinity to1965” exhibit, exploring the details and implications of NASA’s first unmannedmission to Mars, Mariner 4. The unique exhibit was designed and executed byRichard Hoagland as his first “Mars project,” when he was the Museum’s curatorof astronomy and space science.“Mars: Infinity to 1965” was (for its time) a “state-of-the-art” multi-mediaprogram exploring “the scientific and cultural implications for Humankind,surrounding the first NASA unmanned fly-by of the ‘fabled’ planet Mars—byMariner 4.”The program included “space paintings” (an exhibit of original “Bonestells”),projected NASA film and TV images, 3-D physical exhibits (including a “hangingsolar system,” to electrically track the orbit of Mariner 4 en route to Mars),and a mock-up “growing plants on Mars experiment” from Union Carbide.The Mars exhibit I designed (and even physically constructed, in part), and thePeabody Award-nominated live radio show I co-produced and presented to NewEngland the night of the fly-by became the first NASA mission I wasprofessionally involved with.Mariner 4 recorded twenty-two “primitive” television close-ups31 of the frigidMartian deserts in those few “close-encounter” hours, for playbacklater … close-ups on which it would become shockingly apparent, in the daysafter Mariner 4’s successful fly-by, that Mars—instead of being covered with “anartificial network of Martian-constructed ‘Lowellian canals’”—was, instead,covered with millions of ancient impact craters, just like the lifeless Moon![images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_008_r1.jpg]Figure 8. Two overlapped Mariner 4 red and blue filtered images of Mars,together with a “synthesized green,” create the “full color” smaller imagein-between. Mariner 4’s twenty-two historic images revealed for the first timethe long history of “ancient impact craters on Mars”—a development thatultimately killed “the Martian legend of a once-inhabited Mars,” vigorouslypromoted in the early twentieth century by Boston brahmin Percival Lowell.What made Mariner 4’s discovery of a “heavily cratered Mars” doubly ironic wasthe fact that Tombaugh, in addition to his historic discovery of Pluto, from hislater Martian telescopic investigations was among a handful of astronomers inthe 1950s to successfully predict—well before Mariner 4’s 1965 transformativeMartian fly-by that July night—the existence of “impact craters on Mars.”Ironically (for an astronomer working from the very Observatory specificallycreated by Percival Lowell to prove the existence of Martian life), thesecraters were skillfully used by “others,” in the wake of Mariner 4, to begin thepolitical dismantling of the entire “Lowellian Legend” of former (or current)intelligent life on Mars.But in perhaps the ultimate “Mars/Pluto coincidence,” we now find out thatNASA’s New Horizons spacecraft is being deliberately targeted to fly closest toPluto32—six thousand miles “close”—the night of July 15, 2015, at 11:49 GM, amere eleven hours later than the exact moment, fifty years before, when Mariner4 first flew six thousand miles from Mars, beginning the late twentieth century“excommunication” of a potentially “inhabitable Red Planet.”Eleven hours … out of half a century. An “error”—across fifty years—of0.0000295: yup, sheer coincidence.So, by drawing a deliberate and precise (remember, to 0.00295 percent …)“half-century link” between the “first-time” exploration of these two“classical” planets, between “the first Mars NASA fly-by” in 1965 and this (muchpolitically-delayed) “first Pluto fly-by” in 2015, was NASA trying to “signal”(and, to whom?) its own “insider knowledge” of some kind of “underlyingMars-Pluto connection”? To be “revealed” during the New Horizons fly-by!? A“Mars/Pluto heads-up” deliberately “encoded” in the (obvious) deliberate timingof the upcoming NASA Pluto encounter to precisely fifty years (plus those eleven“tetrahedral” hours) after the historic legacy of Mariner 4?Precisely fifty years …What could “fifty,” as part of a possible “hidden NASA message” in the NewHorizons fly-by timing, mean in the larger context of a possible “Mars-PlutoConnection” … that would demand a code to communicate?Wasn’t it obvious?—Another NASA ritual.Given NASA’s documented propensity for doing exactly that, over and over again(detailed in our previous, extensive examinations of NASA’s stealthy “coding” ofkey celestial and numerical rituals into its planetary and human missions),33 Inow wondered if the number “50” itself might represent not a “period of time”(an orbit), but some kind of NASA “mythological/symbolic link” … potentially, tosome kind of “creation event” or “sacred location” or ancient “god” to whichNASA was now, apparently, calling specific, symbolic attention … in connectionwith its impending first robotic exploration of “highly anomalous Pluto.”In fact, there was.…In ancient “Mesopotamian” cosmology, Enlil (the Sumerian “chief creator god” ofthe world’s earliest known “high civilization”) was also known, in the sacredtexts, by his “celestial number”—50.During the subsequent, several-millennia transition of the Sumerian into theBabylonian civilization, the new reigning deity, linguistically, evolved into“Marduk” … still, however, cosmologically identified by the same “sacredcelestial 50.” And “Marduk,” by the time of Babylon … as “chief god, 50” … alsohad become identified with—Mars.So, one compelling, documentable “Mars-Pluto connection” for New Horizons (iftreated like NASA has clandestinely treated all its other planetary and lunarmissions—mythologically), equaled:An Enlil/Marduk/Mars/Pluto/New Horizons Connection–All by way of “50.”All of which meant … “what?”In Sumerian cosmology/theology, among his other duties, Enlil presided over the“creation and guidance of humankind” [the same god who later sent the flood (inthe “Eridu Genesis”)34 … to get rid of his “mistake”].Could the deliberate attachment of the number “50” to this first “NASA Plutomission” (by simply, quietly and cleverly, delaying it … for many years … until“the time was right”) be a coded signal ultimately relating to “ancientknowledge of humankind’s real solar system origins”—the story behind the ancientSumerian “Enlil creation myth” of “50”—somehow, involving Mars … and Pluto?!Remember Disney, subliminally attaching a “Sirius meme” to Pluto in the publicmind—with “his new cartoon ‘pup’ … now, forever connected to the newly-foundninth planet?”Well, in Dogon/Egyptian mythology, “50” was the specific number for the “dogstar,” Sirius, because (the Dogon claimed) of the “fifty-year elliptical orbitof Sirius … and its abnormally “heavy” companion star, Po Tolo … around eachother (a Dogon concept held millennia before the early twentieth centuryastronomical confirmation of an Earth-sized, super-dense white dwarf star,orbiting Sirius every fifty years … “Sirius-B”).Was “50,” then, really a multi-leveled, mythologically coded ancient celestialreference (again, secretly by NASA) — to “a distant planetary epoch of ‘thecreator gods’ themselves … when, the entire solar system was ‘magically’transformed” … by way of the intervention of the “gods” from a Type IIcivilization?A process that—via this “sacred celestial number,” 50 – would also now seemdirectly associated (because of that “half-century orbital period”) with thenear-by main sequence A-type star, “Sirius?”Were we on Earth, living amid the “shattered remains” of a once vast and ancient“Sirius Solar System Renovation Project”—designed to ultimately arrange for a“suitable” planetary environment … in this carefully “redesigned,” near-by starsystem — a designer planetary environment suitable for … humans?Perchance, a carefully-prepared ancient “cosmic ‘garden?’”Does, in fact, NASA’s arcane New Horizons “Pluto heads-up”—clearly coded in theextraordinarily precise timing of New Horizons’s arrival at Pluto in July2015—quietly foreshadow (to “those who know”) the imminent, long-awaited NASApublication of scientific evidence (from the New Horizons mission) affirmingthat Pluto, indeed, was once part of “a solar-system-wide, ancient ETcivilization—quite likely now connected to Sirius?”[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_009_r1.jpg]Figure 9. Artificial “geometry” on Pluto? A NASA artist visually “speculates”what the New Horizons Mission might discover.The most frequent examples of quietly “shouting down the millennia … to laterepochs,” of sending an Important Message down through time to “a select few”(while having the message ignored by everybody else), historically, has been tosimply “talk in code.”The highly-entertaining Walt Disney Pictures National Treasure I and II—througha fictional story-arc beginning with “cracking a series of historical cluesdeliberately left by the Founders,” to “a vast and ancient treasure”—acquainteda lot of folks with an “untaught” historical reality surrounding the founding ofthe United States … a reality that’s hardly ever hinted at in school. Before,during, and after the Revolution (just as National Treasure indicates), ourFounding Fathers did a lot of “talking in code”—encrypting the secrets of thecreation of an entire nation in an ancient symbolic language (just look at adollar bill), the deepest translations of which are truly known only to “thosein the know” (those belonging to certain “ancient fraternal orders”).A symbolic language, as we’ve shown elsewhere,35 that we now know can trace itsultimate origins—to Mars.As Lost Horizon was both a remarkable work of entertainment and an important“message film” for the 1930s (just before WWII), so I have come to suspect thatDisney’s National Treasure should be viewed as a uniquely-coded “message movie”for our time, under the guise of “entertainment” and “coincidentally” involvingthe themes most central to our own three decades of Enterprisemulti-disciplinary research:Ancient terrestrial/extraterrestrial civilizationsAncient advanced knowledge, preserved by those past civilizationsAncient advanced technologies (machines), based on a real Physics, archivedredundantly from those same ancient civilizations both here on Earth and acrossthe ancient solar systemAnd, the crucial “terrestrial connection” to all of this: Our proposed ancientET ancestor contact, with the most ancients roots of human civilizations … stillconfined to Earth.At the end of the second National Treasure film, Nicolas Cage (playing BenGates, the code-breaking “Indiana Jones”—type at the heart of the franchise) hasa fascinating exchange with a (deliberately depicted) “Kennedy-esque” president(Bruce Greenwood) over an “item” in a fictional “President’s Book”:President: Ben, I am curious about that favor I asked you … any report regardingwhat’s on page 47?Gates: I believe I can help with that, sir.President: So, it’s good …Gates: Life-altering, sir.The fact that this exchange is built around a mythical “presidential entry onpage 47,” of a mythical “Presidents’ Book” of centuries-held “national secrets,”definitely should not be taken, in this context, just at face value … as merely“entertaining fiction” (the “meta-lesson” of the films themselves).Quite possibly this is a real “code!”The redundant references to “47” seem a thinly-veiled reference to “1947”—notonly the year of the most famous “UFO/ secret ET technology” case in history(Roswell, repeatedly referenced in the film); but also, via the same “19.47”code, a compelling intimation of the “life-altering” properties ofHyperdimensional/Torsion Field Physics—unleashed in stars and planets at “19.47degrees” … in a rotating planetary/stellar context.“What’s on page 47” could be the ultimate “National Treasure”: immeasurablyenriching not only the lives of every American, but every human being onEarth … a tantalizing clue to the “new treasure” that might be the centerpieceof the final sequel—National Treasure 3, scheduled for release (at this writing)the summer of 2015 … just as NASA could be boggling our eyes and minds withwhat’s really on Pluto.In this National Treasure code model, the true nature of Pluto (as a potential“Ancient Archive/HD Generator”) would have been deliberately “imprinted in code”into the “Plutonian System” itself … by the Type II Civilization responsible forits “redesign.” Such that, when a subsequent technological civilization (us?)finally arose again on Earth (even long after “the War”), able to once againtranslate such a set of stark “Plutonian orbital distances … periods … and other‘Keplerian’ numbers” back into the right numerical code—the receivingcivilization would also recognize (from its own, independent rediscoveries) thatthe ultimate “message” in Pluto’s orbit was written in aHyperdimensional/Torsion-Field” code: the language of “the Physics” that had tohave been used by our proposed “Type II Civilization” to remodel the originalsolar system in the first place!Pluto’s unique, dramatically inclined orbital parameters—compared to the(essentially) “co-planar” solar system inward of Neptune—was, of course,designed (in this “artificial model”) to make Pluto immediately stand out asobviously “different” from all the other the inner planets, with its 17.1-degreeinclination, 39 AU average solar distance, and 248-year orbital period:unmistakable (to the “right set of eyes”) as coded directions to a “higher-ordertranslation.”If Pluto was, indeed, the potential lynchpin in some “Ancient Grand Design” forultimately preserving and passing along knowledge of “the true history of theremodeled ancient solar system,” and over geological time, then its creators—ourmuch-discussed Type II Civilization—would have had every incentive, andcertainly the means, to make Pluto’s crucial role blatantly obvious to any“curious civilizations” that came after.Including even “cosmically-challenged” descendants, like ourselves.So, if such an ancient “Pluto code” is real, what should we be looking for viaNew Horizons—as physical evidence supporting these radical ideas … potentiallydetectable (if we know “what” we are looking for) to the wide variety ofinstruments carried aboard the New Horizons mission?Proceeding on the logical assumption that our proposed Type II Civilizationredundantly encoded “HD information” in many aspects of its “redesigned” ancientsolar system (as, preserving “the Physics” was clearly one of its highestdemonstrable priorities), the simplest place to start with regard to Pluto, asnoted earlier, would be to look—à la National Treasure—for a “code,” preservedin the most obvious location possible—Pluto’s basic orbital parameters.Let’s begin, then, with that fundamental “248-Earth year orbital period” for one“Plutonian year”—easily established by comparing Tombaugh’s initial series ofdiscovery photographs to Pluto’s incremental movement on photos taken later.That number—248—is also, astonishingly (to three significant figures!) exactlythe same number as Pluto’s orbital eccentricity36 (elliptical departure from a“perfect” circle, as it orbits the Sun) along that same “248-year path”:P = 248 … Ecc = 0.248The odds against these two numbers being the same (and, to three significantfigures) “by sheer coincidence,” were (literally) astronomically against,because the two parameters—orbital period and orbital eccentricity—were (asmathematicians would say) “totally decoupled”; neither one physically dependingon the other for any specific value, from zero to “infinity.”Yet here, with Pluto, those two totally independent physical orbital parameterswere, somehow, numerically identical. How come!?Lacking any known natural “drivers” for such an extraordinarily low-probabilityevent, the only plausible alternative is that the Pluto year/eccentricity“coincidence” was designed, part of the deliberate Pluto “heads-up.”So, what was intrinsically “important” about 248? Why not an exact “250” … orsome other randomly chosen period?Well … “248” happens to be the “lowest order” product of the multiplication, by“two,” of each succeeding number in the same string … starting with the number“2”:“Two times two equals four … two times four equals eight, etc.”—2 4 8.To a first order, the fundamental “intent” behind selecting “248” would seem tohave been to communicate both a geometric progression (rapid “amplification” ofa starting number—2 when multiplied by 2 …), simultaneously, linked with aharmonic sequence (indicating “frequency”) per the same doubling of thepreceding number—2 … 4 … 8.This strongly implies that “the most important ‘something’ to note aboutPluto”—when we could physically reach out to it—might be confirmation of somekind of “harmonic … amplifying process” occurring there. A major clue to whatthat “process” might be would seem to lie in the additional orbital “coding” (inour model), inherent in the third listed orbital parameter: Pluto’s averagedistance from the Sun … a little more than 39 AU.And 39, of course, is twice “19.5”—strongly implying (in the “code”) that the“harmonics” we should be looking for will not be “electromagnetic,” but will liein Pluto’s invisible (to “normal” detectors) changing “HD/torsion field” … whichcreates, in rotating planetary and stellar objects, a distinct “energy upwellingsignature”—at “19.5 degrees.”Perchance, an artificial “torsion-field generator”—carefully placed somewhere onPluto (at 19.5?) or elsewhere in the Plutonian system (on one of Pluto’s moons?)by our proposed “Type II Civilization” as a deliberate “beacon” to further mark“its crucial solar system Archive!”The first mainstream scientist (that I know of) to seriously propose that Plutomight, in fact, be “some kind of super-advanced, ‘ET mega-mechanism’”—attemptingto scientifically explain, within our 1960s aerospace knowledgebase, themounting “anomalies” surrounding Pluto’s increasingly “physically impossible”confirmation—was a gifted physicist working for the Hughes Aircraft CompanyCorporate Research Laboratory, Dr. Robert Forward.37Bob’s fascinating “grand Pluto idea” (published long before our curiousencounter, in the December 1962 issue of Galaxy magazine, as “Pluto: Doorway tothe Stars”)38 was that Pluto might not be “just another member of the outersolar system.” Forward’s suspicion was based on decades of continuing failure(even into the 1940s and ’50s) of the largest telescopes on Earth (like Mt.Palomar’s famed “two-hundred-inch Hale Reflector”) to detect any hint of a discat Pluto—corresponding to “a planet matching Lowell’s pre-discoverygravitational estimate of ‘six or seven Earth masses.’” Forward’s grudgingconclusion: “Pluto,” in fact, might not be a “planet” after all (shades of theforty-four-years later IAU decision)!Bob Forward’s counter-proposal (buttressed by a lot of “relativistic physics”)envisioned a radical alternative—that, instead of being another natural planet,Pluto might, in fact, be:“A deliberately-created, high-tech ET artifact!”Left as a Gift … from a hypothetical “Galactic Federation.”Perchance … a “relativistic Galactic transport mechanism”—designed as adeliberate “intervention” by ETTo “help us toward the stars” … when we were “ready” (practically defined as“being able to physically reach Pluto”).(And some folks think I have an “overactive” scientific imagination.)Forward calculated that such a far-reaching “ET interstellar transporttechnology” could be built around “a relatively ‘small quantity’ of degenerate(white dwarf-density) stellar material” crammed into a donut-shapedconfiguration, physically “about the size of Mercury”—but containing around sixtimes Earth’s mass.By swirling this degenerate matter around the “donut” at almost the speed oflight (!) until it (à la “Relativity”) visibly “bent space,” the resulting“artificial gravity” of such a whirling Ring—acting uniformly on every atom ofany vehicle using it, Forward calculated—was capable of gravitationallyaccelerating a manned spaceship (because of its relativistically-enhanced mass)to close to that same speed (the speed of light) in a matter of seconds, afterwhich, the ship (and its occupants) would coast between the stars for yearsbefore arriving at its destination. This would allow—all based on “knownphysics”—genuine human interstellar travel (when we physically reached Pluto) if(and, it was a big “if”):The same “super-advanced ET civilization” had thoughtfully placed an identical“relativistic ring” at the other end of each potential “interstellar journey”from the solar system—wating in orbit around all the nearest stars—which, whenproperly approached geometrically, would gently slow the accelerated spacecraftback down to “interplanetary speeds” for a successful planetary rendezvous atthe other end of such “relativistic interstellar journeys”: a “GalacticTransport Network” (ah … Stargate: SG-1 anyone … again?).In part, Forward’s exotic “Plutonian gravity generator/galactic transport node”was concocted, in 1962, as a somewhat “desperate” conventional physics attemptat an explanation of Pluto’s (apparent, under some interpretations of Lowell’sbafflingly accurate prediction) “variable mass” (seriously!); Forward was asbothered by Lowell’s (apparent) “luck” in successfully predicting “just byaccident” the pre-discovery location for Pluto, despite his serious mathematicalerrors, as a lot of other folks were:39This [the Pluto confirmation, initially] looked like another fantastic piece ofmathematical theory by Lowell. However Brown reviewed the data which Lowell hadused and showed that there was no way that he [Lowell] could have made thecorrect [Pluto positional] prediction based on the [anomalous Uranus andNeptune] data. [emphases added]—J. J. O’CONNOR and E. F. ROBERTSON, “Mathematical Discovery of Planets”Thus, Forward’s amazing “ET Pluto Gravity Ring” had the potential—within therealm of “known” 1960s science—to (finally) physically answer the serious “Plutodiscovery discrepancies.”A prime feature of such a Ring would be that, when oriented at certain anglesrelative to the other planets in the solar system, it could, theoretically, varyits innate long-distance gravitational effect (which, unlike true gravity, wasnot “spherically symmetrical”) on these other solar system objects—in a processakin to a classical “science fiction tractor or presser beam” effect.But, at other times—when this non-spherical, “relativistically-created gravitymachine” was not aimed at those planets—nothing.Forward thus theorized that this “varying gravitational attraction”—directly asa result of General Relativity and his “artificial Pluto’s” inexorableprecession—could be the reason why, when Lowell’s ephemeris discrepancies forUranus and Neptune were compared with later efforts, the two sets ofobservations didn’t match; Pluto’s current miniscule physical gravitationalattraction on Uranus and Neptune, because of the continuing precession of theRing in the intervening decades, and the associated alteration of its“gravitational attraction geometry,” had simply (in Forward’s theory) inevitablydecreased any observable effects on Uranus and Neptune.Bob Forward died in 2002, about a year before the first, startling“inertia-is-capable-of-being-changed” empirical results from our own ten-yearseries of Enterprise “HD/Torsion Field” experiments began coming in; theseexperiments started with the acquisition of remarkable Enterprise Accutron datafrom the rare Venus Transit of the Sun40 that we observed from Coral Castle,Homestead, Florida in 2003.This was followed, over the succeeding decade, by on-site Enterprise directmeasurements of the changing terrestrial background torsion field from a varietyof other global locations—including a list of “ancient, sacredsites”—culminating with the dramatic and highly complex inertial changesmeasured directly in the path of an eclipse of the Sun, as seen fromAlbuquerque, New Mexico in 2012.From this decade of archived Enterprise HD/torsion background data, it hasbecome clear that local “aligned and spinning celestial objects” (like the Sun,Moon, and transiting/eclipsing planets like Venus) all create measurable changesin the inertia (mass) of appropriately designed torsion-field detectors—whenthose detectors are placed directly within geometric planetary / moon alignments/ transits / eclipses.Further, these observed inertial changes are more than one hundred million timesstronger than distant effects predicted by Forward’s proposed “inertial /gravitational ring,” based again on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.41This makes them easily detectable by anyone using the Enterprise Mission’sunique Accutron torsion field detection system, seen here against a portion ofthe astonishing HD/Torsion solar eclipse data we acquired with this system in2012.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_010_r1.jpg]Figure 10. Schematic of The Enterprise Mission’s “Hyperdimensional/TorsionField” Accutron measurement system—depicted against an image of the May 5, 2012annular solar eclipse, and the actual Accutron “HD/torsion data” acquired forthe first time by Enterprise during that eclipse.Torsion conditions that will certainly also exist, based on these extensiveEnterprise celestial torsion observations, for New Horizons at Pluto. Created bythe synchronous Pluto/Charon 6.4—day rotation/revolution, and furthersynchronized with the constantly moving/constantly resonating/constantlyeclipsing four (currently known) additional Plutonian moons, such aspecifically-designed, “resonant torsion system” (in the model) could not helpbut produce unique, time-varying torsion field-effects all across the solarsystem—including on distant Earth. These would peak (amplify its generatedtorsion field pattern geometrically) every 124 years, as Pluto’s -120-degreeobliquity to its own orbit caused the “generated, aligned, opposing twin polartorsion-beams” to intersect the Earth twice every Plutonian Year, in arecurring, 248-years-long Plutonian total “Hyperdimensional ‘astrological’”pattern.This model is increasingly supported with every new official Pluto observation,the latest example being Hubble’s detection42 (beginning in 2006) of those fouradditional co-planar Plutonian moons—Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra (discovereddecades after Charon, Pluto’s previously single known moon, fully half the sizeof Pluto, which was initially recognized on photographs taken by the US NavalObservatory in 1978).The four additional Pluto “Hubble moonlets,” though insignificant compared toCharon (merely a few tens of miles across, against Charon’s 740 miles), turnedout to possess extraordinarily “harmonic” 3, 4, 5, 6 orbits relative to bothPluto’s own rotation and Charon’s identical rotation/revolution.In the Enterprise model, these precisely “tuned Plutonian satellite parameters”were, once again, part of a deliberate ancient design to reinforce its possibleprimary, artificial “harmonic torsion message”—explicit in the Plutoniansystem’s unique “harmonically coded” orbital motions.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_011_r1.jpg]Figure 11. Hubble Telescope Pluto image, compared to a schematic of thecurrently known Pluto “system.”Here (below), by way of example of the radically different types of “torsionreadings” that might be (secretly) returned from New Horizons to NASA as thespacecraft flies through the Plutonian system, are a few hours of recentEnterprise Accutron “occultation torsion data” of the Sun, a record of thedramatic background inertial field changes (in our hypothesis) that occurred inthe Accutron detector during the “ultimate” planetary alignment in May 2012.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_012_r1.jpg]Figure 12. Enterprise Mission “time-versus-frequency” record of the dramaticallychanging “HD/torsion inertial field,” measured by monitoring the Accutron tuningfork frequency changes occurring during the May 20, 2012 annular solar eclipse.As can be seen, even before “First Contact” (above, far left), the EnterpriseAccutron detector registers the lunar occultation of the solar chromosphere byresponding with an abrupt frequency change of its internal tuning fork, before adramatically different torsion signature then appears just seconds later—markingthe formal beginnings of the eclipse itself by the occulting Moon.As the eclipse continues to progress (see image, left to right), and theAccutron tuning fork frequency continues to dramatically change, it eventuallybecame clear (in the course of three years of “post-Eclipse analysis” we haveperformed on this data, so far) that what we are seeing in the Accutron graphwas nothing less than a “2-D torsion field map” of the interior of the Sun’s andMoon’s various “torsion-generating/occulting layers”! These changing frequencyreadings were created, we hypothesized, as the Sun’s “solar plasmatorsion-generators” were being successively covered and uncovered by theconstantly moving, rotating interior layers of the eclipsing Moon, resulting ina set of changing, interfering torsion frequencies during the Sun and Moon’sconstantly changing geometric alignment!In our provisional model, these differentially-rotating plasma layers inside theSun—of radically-differing temperatures, ionization states and densities, fromthe surface to the core—were each, apparently, generating individual dominanttorsion-field vibrations in the “aether” unique to that particular rotatingplasma layer; the eclipsing Moon—with its own, equally-layered interiorgeology—was apparently, via its solid-body rotation, creating a series ofinterference torsion frequencies, as both rotating celestial objects’ individualtorsion-field patterns “beat” against each other.… Serendipitously, by sensingthis inertia-altering process with our Accutron’s miniature tuning fork (which,through its rapidly changing inertial response to the changing torsion field,had changed its fundamental frequency of vibration to match), we had producedthe world’s first (public) “2-D torsion catscan” of the interiors of both theSun and Moon (below)![images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_013_r1.jpg]Figure 13. Abrupt Accutron tuning fork frequency change (bottom right)correlates, in this cut-away diagram of the interiors of the Sun and Moon, withthe moment the Moon’s inner, solid core (small white circle inside the largerorange one) tangentially occults the Sun’s deep, swift-moving “tachocline layer”at the base of the outer convection zone – providing totally independent torsionconfirmation of the remarkable accuracy of current interior models of the Sunand Moon.The same capability now existed within NASA (and its New Horizons mission) tonot only detect any “torsion beacons” ’ that our great, great, great, greatancestors may have left to mark the proposed Archive’s location on Pluto—but thesimultaneous ability to create 2-D “torsion maps” of the interior geologicalstructures of both Pluto and Charon.All that would be needed would the “right” New Horizons trajectory through thePlutonian system, and the right” torsion detection instrumentation” on board.From the looks of it (see image), New Horizons is, in fact, going to be shot (atthirty thousand miles per hour) through the perfect “eye of the needle” duringits several-hour Plutonian fly-by, navigated to the “ideal position” to conductdirect, secret “HD/Torsion Field” measurements of the entire Plutoniansystem—along with its (much-advertised) “conventional” planetary science.This will include torsion readings acquired from inside two verycarefully-arranged “satellite eclipses” of the Sun, by Pluto and Charon, as NewHorizons is directed to fly diagonally across their extremely extendedshadows … within hours of the spacecraft’s “closest-approaches” to the twoeclipsing objects themselves. Potential torsion measurements that, from our ownprevious Enterprise experiments, we now have little doubt will quietly confirmprofound “hyperdimensional/torsion-arranged signatures” emanating from theentire Plutonian system … directly (if clandestinely) detectable by NewHorizons.43[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_014_r1.jpg]Figure 14. NASA artistic vision of a series of “cryo-volcanoes” on Pluto, withthe ultra-thin atmosphere visible in “forward-scattered light” from the ~39 AU(twice 19.5 …) distant sun.Given that astronomical “HD/torsion effects” (in our physics model) are thedirect result of intrinsic rotation, coupled with (orbital) revolution of two ormore massive celestial objects around each others, all modulated by theirconstantly changing relative geometric orbital alignments … the fact that NewHorizons will pass almost vertically through the “common orbit plane” of all ofPluto’s “suspiciously” co-planar and “harmonic” moons (see image), will providea unique HD geometry for measuring the predicted “interference torsion fieldeffects” of Pluto’s current polar axis (and concomitant equatorial satelliteorbital) orientations—including, as previously noted, carefully arrangedHD/torsion measurements to be conducted in passing directly through Pluto andCharon’s respective “HD/torsion shadows,” which, from the spacecraft’s viewpointrepresents two back-to-back eclipses of the distant sun).[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_015_r1.jpg]Figure 15. An artist impression of an eclipse of Pluto by its single large moon,Charon. As empirically determined by the Enterprise Mission, terrestrialeclipses have measureable “HD/torsion field effects.” The geometry of the NewHorizons fly-by through the Plutonian system has apparently been carefullyarranged to allow four “artificial eclipses” during the Encounter—into theshadows of both Pluto and Charon, as seen from the sun and Earth … allowing NASAunique “in situ” HD/torsion measurements of the Plutonian system.Again, from our own repeated Enterprise Mission Accutron HD/Torsion Fieldmeasurements—especially of the Annular Solar Eclipse that passed directly overAlbuquerque on May 20, 2012—it is obviously, from our perspective, nocoincidence that NASA has carefully planned for the New Horizons spacecraft (inthose familiar words from Forbidden Planet)—“to arrange for its own eclipses.”Only in this manner can New Horizons “torsion scan” the interiors of Pluto andCharon, to discern if there are, indeed, any anomalous geometric featuresunderground, potentially associated with an “artificially-designed ET Archive,”hyperdimensionally marking” the precise location of those surviving ancientLibraries. Simultaneously, it can test the possibility that Pluto—in addition toits potential role as a “physical time-capsule/Archive” from the ancient solarsystem—may also have been carefully placed in its unique solar system orbit toact as a deliberate, high-angle “planetary HD/Torsion Field beacon/generator”—aspart of the carefully interlocking, “Hyperdimensional/Torsion redesign” of theentire solar system.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_016_r1.jpg]Figure 16. Top-down view of New Horizons ~90-degree fly-by geometry through thePlutonian system; note the four scheduled eclipses of the sun and Earth(“occultations”) this carefully chosen trajectory allows by Pluto andCharon—insuring unique HD/torsion insitu measurements of both large orbitingbodies … if NASA deigns to tell us.Was Stern’s New Horizons mission (another name replete with “ancient Egyptian‘reincarnation’ overtones”—and we know how NASA loves “Egyptian overtones”)really a mission to ultimately, symbolically reincarnate our own culturalplanetary awareness of our real, “ancient, Type II solar system heritage”?Remarkably, Pluto’s own “coded” inclination (in the model) of 17 degrees to therest of the inner planets’ orbits, perfectly matched the ancient Egyptianinvocation of “17” as a number symbolic of “renewal and resurrection.”44 Was NewHorizons to be the instrument of that “resurrection” by simply, at the “righttime” (judged, again, “ritually”), telling us the truth? And, were “mid-2015”and the upcoming amazing New Horizons Pluto fly-by the beginnings of “ThatTime?”OK, it’s a great theory (I hear you saying), but where’s the evidence?Again, “in plain sight”—in NASA’s (and other space agency) official archives: ifyou know “how” to look.Out of all the NASA (and other space agency) robotic expeditions sent across thesolar system over the last half-century, most of the “small objects” thosemissions have successfully encountered—always carefully labeled as just “anothercomet or asteroid mission” in all news coverage—actually appear, from quietly“leaked” information coming out of NASA, to be nothing less than visits tolong-abandoned, ancient ET spaceships!The most blatant, recent example of this “in plain sight” gambit is the EuropeanUnion’s (ESA) unmanned Rosetta spacecraft mission, placed into “loose orbit” ofcomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko August 6, 2014—a little less than a year beforethe Pluto New Horizons fly-by.Eventually Rosetta would attempt to land a smaller unmanned probe, named“Philae,” on the comet’s surface. At this writing, high-resolution Rosettaimages are coming back from less than thirty miles off comet 67P, as thespacecraft slowly cruises through a bizarre set of (ritual?) equilateral“triangular approach orbits” (see image).Mission: to survey a cometThe European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft will carry out tough manoeuvresonce it arrives at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_017_r1.jpg]Figure 17.

Such “geometric (even if badlyeroded …) symmetry” strongly hints at an artificial origin for these paralleland right-angle geometric features, if not this entire “comet.”Remarkably symmetric.Another perspective image, acquired a few days later during Rosetta’s continuingapproach (see image), clearly revealed a series of “suspiciously geometric”protuberances all along the limb of both the comet’s “lobes.”[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_019_r1.jpg]Figure 19. Different orientation of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, relative tothe Rosetta spacecraft. The “head” in this Osiris image is to the right; thecomet’s “body” is to the left.

The closest view, from this angle, of the collection of “erodedruins” arranged around the apex of the “comet’s” larger lobe; the presence ofsuch symmetry and geometric “order”—on a “rapidly evaporating, chaotic icysurface …”—allows only one reasonable conclusion: this geometry was artificiallycreated—and not from “ice” … and must be, because of the severe erosion evident,also extremely old …..In another, even closer Osiris oblique camera view (of the smaller lobe or“head”—see image), a veritable “ancient archaeological complex,” equallyheavily-eroded, is stunningly visible along its apex too.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_022_r1.jpg]Figure 22. In this later Rosetta “NavCam” view, what appears to be the remainsof an ancient, heavily-eroded “archaeological complex”—with small clusters ofmuch more “modern” structures in between—stands atop another apex of the“comet’s” smaller lobe.And, an even closer view (below) reveals an exquisitely geometric,multi-leveled, clearly artificial wall, stretching across another apex of thesmaller lobe.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_023_r1.jpg]Figure 23. Another, even closer NavCam perspective on a different “edge’ of67P’s smaller lobe, reveals a massive “wall”—composed of highly complex,geometrically-arranged “substructures”—obviously built by “someone.”Only exceeded by this new Rosetta NavCam view below—when the spacecraft (onSeptember 10, 2014 drifted within eighteen miles of the comet.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_024_r1.jpg]Figure 24.

A close-up of two adjacent structures seen in Figure 23[Gros_9781583948989_epub_c03_r1.htm#fig023], reveals their radically differentarchitectural designs—indicating either “heavily-shielded fortifications” … or,massive, sealed “arcologies” for housing tens of thousands.…Equally significant (besides their sheer existence) was the fact that theseartificial “comet” structures appeared eerily familiar—as seen in this scaledcomparison of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenkowith downtown Los Angeles.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_026_r1.jpg]Figure 26. Artist’s scaled comparison between the City of Los Angeles and Comet67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Note that several downtown skyscrapers are required(in terms of volume) to equal one “mega-structure” on 67P.This confirmed the remarkably “human” geometry and scale of the potentialarchitecture being blatantly imaged on the surface of “67P,” further reinforcingthe impression that this increasingly bizarre object was definitely not just “acomet,” but quite likely another example of an “ancient, long-abandonedinterplanetary derelict”—either a ship or an entire interplanetary habitat,still venting into space (below) wisps of its once massive internal atmosphere,as it periodically orbitally approaches (and warms from increasing exposure to)the Sun, every 6.5 years.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_027_r1.jpg]Figure 27. Escaping water (at a rate of about one glass per second) formsspectacular twin jets rushing into space from the “neck” connecting the twolobes of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko “comet” in these approaching July, 2014Rosetta images. This “collimated jet phenomenon” is a stubbornly bafflingfeature of all “comets” selected for close-up spacecraft reconnaissance over thelast decade; the jets’ pervasive existence has created major (if still generallyunacknowledged) difficulties for the traditional mainstream comet model, of“surface pockets of cometary ices, flashing into vapor under the increasing heatof the Sun.” Despite intensive imaging of multiple objects, a surface source forthese widespread gas and dust emissions has not been found on any “comet”visited … reinforcing the Enterprise Mission’s radically different “ancientspacecraft” model, that inherently predicts an interior, mechanical source(passageways or elevator shafts) for passively collimating such widespread“anomalously linear gas jets.”Alternatively, the Europeans could have “stumbled upon” the first astonishingdirect evidence of Tom Van Flandern’s “exploded planet hypothesis”46—a genuine,miles-wide, continental fragment, complete with “the ruins of a once massiveplanetary city still anchored to its bedrock,” blasted into space when theplanet underneath it, literally exploded … leaving provocative evidence, in theshattered geometric form of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its colossal,surface “mega-structures,” of the extraordinary power of the Type IICivilization which once remodeled an entire solar system, and the equally potentforces which, much later, radically, violently, attempted to destroy it. TheeRosetta images made the possibility of a deliberate “Ancient Solar SystemArchive—carefully preserved on high inclination Pluto” (or, somewhere in therest of the Plutonian “system”), in our opinion, even more deserving of seriousconsideration.After seeing the amazing “approach” images to “67P,”47 the fact that thisseminal ESA mission is named “Rosetta” should be another, major clue regardingits own possible “real mission”—certainly to anyone who has followed NASA’s owndeeply “Egyptian” predilections over the last half-century. Rosetta—openly namedafter the “game changing” breakthrough in Egyptian hieroglyph translation of an“extinct terrestrial civilization” in the nineteenth century—can only be viewedas an even more telling designation now. This mission had the potential toreveal as much about the Type II “extinct civilization” that left “67P” for usto find … if Philae successfully touches down in the “right” place … as theoriginal Rosetta Stone revealed to the nineteenth century about the AncientEgyptians.But, Rosetta isn’t the only government space mission to have securedastonishing, close-in measurements of an “ancient, outgassing spacecraft”; theclose fly-by of Comet Hartley 2, in late 2010, by a NASA spacecraft called DeepImpact (re-targeted from its previous, successful “impacting mission” to anothercomet), provided amazing, even earlier confirmatory data for our Enterprise“remodeled Solar System” model.On the highest-resolution Deep Impact NASA images of Hartley 2 (see image), thetrue nature of this misnamed “comet” was stunningly revealed …[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_028_r1.jpg]Figure 28. The true nature of “Comet Hartley 2” (1.25 miles across) is starklyrevealed in this “leaked,” high-resolution Deep Impact NASA image, taken duringthe spacecraft comet flyby in 2010; miles of highly organized, internal“building-like” geometry are nakedly exposed through the (now missing—fromconstant micro-meteorite erosion) outer “hull”—just one hint at how trulyancient this derelict must be.… Narrow gas jets, vestiges of the remaininginternal atmosphere still escaping into space, can be seen along the “ship’s”right-hand limb (a wider view of the “collimated geometry” of this continuedoutgassing can be seen in the smaller, deliberately over-exposed inset image).The presence of similar collimated jets, gushing from the “comet’s” dark (andfrigid shadow—inset), effectively demolishes the “surface warming theory”; wherewould the energy to vaporize surface ice lying in that shadow (in “the standardcomet model”) come from in the dark? The internal “gas release model,” withremaining water vapor and other identified constituents venting along deepinternal passageways, fits Deep Impact’s observations of Hartley 2’s “nightsidejets” perfectly.…… as a genuine, one and a quarter mile-long ancient interplanetary spaceship!Its long-since eroded “hull” disclosing cubic miles of former interior, 3-D“rectilinear geometry,” instantly revealed Hadley 2’s “true, architecturalidentity.”So, does the upcoming NASA Pluto fly-by provide any additionalopportunities—besides the (for most folks, too arcane) HD Physics—for testingour sweeping “redesigned ancient solar system” hypothesis?; of detecting, duringthe month-long, New Horizons planetary encounter, other scientific evidence thatcould confirm Pluto’s potential “unique role” in that hypothesis—as adeliberate, ancient solar system Archive?Remarkably, we may have a pretty exact “preview” (again, courtesy of NASA’s ownpublicly available interplanetary data archives) of just what New Horizons couldallow us to see at Pluto, that would indicate the possible presence of“intelligence”—in the form of an earlier-imaged, “distinctly artificial-looking,planetary surface geometry” blatantly visible on “quarter-century-old” NASAvidicon images of Neptune’s largest moon, Triton.When NASA’s unmanned Voyager 2 flew by Neptune in August, 1989,48 it gave us aneerie foreshadowing—a quarter-century before—of what we might experience, inmuch higher fidelity and resolution (to be expected, in the course of theintervening quarter-of-a-century of technological progression), during a futurePluto fly-by; this image from Voyager 2 below is one of the few close-up color(composited) vidicon views of Triton, recorded during the 1989 Voyagerspacecraft encounter.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_029_r1.jpg]Figure 29. In this 1986 Voyager 2 close-up, taken near the south pole ofNeptune’s single large Moon, Triton, we can see a fascinating diversity oftotally unexpected geometric forms—apparently (from separate Voyager spectralmeasurements) buried to varying degrees beneath a surface of solid, nitrogenice. This striking geometry is increasingly revealed (presumably because of athinning of the overlying ice cover …) as you proceed toward the right-hand sideof the image. This extraordinary right-angle surface geometry on Triton does notlook “natural.”On this Triton mosaic (above), at the visible diagonal boundary between thenewer nitrogen/methane “snows” on Triton’s southern polar cap (left side ofimage) and the older “dirty brown/pink” nitrogen ice (from solid carbon mixedin) plains surrounding that polar cap (right side of image), one can see anarray of obvious, buried and semi-buried “strikingly rectilinear geometries”(see close-up below).[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_030_r1.jpg]Figure 30. Close-up of the right-hand section of Figure 28[Gros_9781583948989_epub_c03_r1.htm#fig028], revealing in higher detail theremarkable, repeating architectural geometry … still half-buried in theice … blatantly visible in the polar regions of Triton.Most planetary scientists, after Voyager’s close-up environmental observationsof Neptune’s largest moon, expect Pluto geologically to be a close-analog toTriton. Will that extend to the presence of “half-buried ruins” as well?Referred to euphemistically by NASA as “cantaloupe terrain,” the extraordinarilygeometric formations actually look like something striking familiar, butcategorically “impossible” by all mainstream NASA “science”—“flooded”archaeological ruins, still visible after untold millions of years, half-buriedin the frigid nitrogen “solid atmospheric surface” of Neptune’s largest bizarre“retrograde moon.”At Pluto—primarily (in the Enterprise model) because of Pluto’s dramatic17-degree orbital inclination—if there are similar “ancient, ET ruins” visibleto the New Horizons cameras on its surface, they may be the best-preserved ofany in the solar system—a direct effect of the (calculated) drastically lowerrate of background micrometeorite erosion expected on Pluto, compared to therest of the inner solar system.Erosion which should drop precipitously every time Pluto orbits above (or below)the solar system’s central plane (which, due to Keplerian celestial mechanics,is most of the time—see diagram, below).[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_031_r1.jpg]Figure 31. Perspective computer view of the outer solar system, with the NewHorizons’ trajectory marked in red. The “time hack” is March 1, 2007, just overa year after the spacecraft’s launch to Pluto—which can be seen far above thegeneral solar system plane … moving downward, to its July 14, 2015 rendezvouswith the red line representing NASA’s first mission to the controversial “ninthplanet.”Thus, any preserved “Plutonian ruins,” compared to those found so far in therest of the solar system, might have been protectively frozen for millions ofyears … under “a million, billion tons” of solid nitrogen. Ironically, theywould be frozen in pristine condition by the side-effects of the same,catastrophic ancient cosmic war that murdered (in our Enterprise model) the restof the inner solar system, allowing a greater likelihood of preservation of“ancient Type II ET science and technology” located inside the Plutonian ruinsthemselves.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_032_r1.jpg]Figure 32. Archaeological comparison between the “half-buried ruins at Armarna,Egypt … and the morphologically identical “half-buried ruins” on Triton. Theonly meaningful difference is that one set of ruins is half-buried in sand, andthe other is half-buried in nitrogen ice.…A celestial “Shangri-La,” preserved against a natural Galactic catastrophe, alocal stellar cataclysm, or a catastrophic interplanetary war waged withplanet-killing “HD/Torsion Weapons”—a “safely-preserved archive” of the realhistory of “what this Type II civilization had ‘rearranged’ for our‘creation’”—when we were culturally “prepared enough” (à la “Brookings”) tofinally know.Conceivably, under the frigid, miles-deep layers of solid nitrogen ice projectedfor Pluto’s southern hemisphere, there are preserved, just waiting, entire,intact libraries of first-hand images and video of the millions-of-years-oldtrue “Galactic history of Civilization,” starting from the very beginnings ofthe solar system, if not long, long before.This hypothesis, judging from the vivid examples at Triton, will soon beverifiable at Pluto via the New Horizons mission, and within reach of oursubsequent twenty-first-century human and robotic space technology to physicallyexplore within a generation.But only if we really want to know more.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_033_r1.jpg]Figure 33.

In December 2013, the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA)successfully landed its first robotic mission on the Moon—named Chang’e-3, afterthe Chinese “Goddess of the Moon.” This Chang’e-3 lunar surface image representsstunning Chinese confirmation of what the Enterprise Mission initiallydiscovered (on NASA Apollo data) in 1993—the existence of “ancient, glass ETcities on the Moon!” The striking “glittering glass towers” visible on thisofficial Chinese image, extending along the horizon and upward into space … arethe astonishing proof!Finally, and most spectacularly, is ESA’s current Rosetta mission to“67P” … which has revealed increasingly artificial-looking geometry in eachsuccessive imaging session … as Rosetta drifts ever closer to this clearly“radically anomalous object.”Including, in the latest 67P images released by ESA at this writing, featureswhich look unmistakably like the remains of “gigantic, half-collapsedbuildings”—with their exteriors long-since eroded almost totally away … withtheir bent and mangled former “interior supporting girders” … blatantly exposed(below).[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_036_r1.jpg]Figure 36. Enlarged portion of oblique Rosetta “Navcam” image, taken September19, 2014—revealing another collapsed “mega-structure” on the limb of67P … complete with exposed, girder-like supporting framework!Three “independent,” international space agencies … one likely now “creepingdisclosure agenda”.…Will NASA’s New Horizons Pluto mission successfully complete this “ancientritual” … by, finally, just telling us the Truth this July?!Stay tuned.AddendumAs this chapter was going into “galleys,” several major new developments in thisunfolding drama suddenly took place.The first: NASA’s long-awaited announcement of the Hubble Space Telescope’striumphant discovery—to everyone’s collective relief (after over twenty years ofsearching) in June 2014—of three potential “Kuiper Belt Objects for a NewHorizons fly-by … after Pluto.”49The most likely of these—termed “PT1” (for “Possible Target One”)—is estimated(from brightness assumptions only) to be only thirty miles across; if it wasmuch brighter than the estimates of 3 or 4 percent, it could be much smaller.PT1’s orbit is so close to intersecting New Horizon’s current outward boundtrajectory that only 35 percent of the New Horizons remaining onboard fuel willbe required to effect a successful orbit change for New Horizons to make adirect intercept of PT1 in January 2019.Four more years … and a billion added miles … beyond Pluto.New Horizons represents, according to prevailing “mainstream planetary science,”the first close-up observations of a whole new class of solar systemmembers—termed loosely (by the IAU, in their controversial 2006 decision) “dwarfplanets” (Pluto’s current planetary status notwithstanding).Long before the successful launch of the New Horizons Mission, one of the majorgoals for previously proposed “outer solar system mission to Pluto” (after thediscovery of the first Kuiper Belt object, in 1992) had been “to also find asuitably-orbiting Kuiper Belt object for a second fly-by … after the primaryPluto Mission.”The Hubble discovery of PT1 last June insured (at least in the minds of a lot ofintensely relieved planetary scientists) that New Horizons was going to answerat least some of the most fundamental mysteries remaining about the solarsystem’s true origins.We at Enterprise, looking at the same data from another point of view, had avery different set of “mysteries” in mind …The second major space development that occurred just as we were wrapping upthis chapter was that the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully landed(despite some serious technical anomalies) their Philae unmanned cometary probeon the surface of “67P” on November 12, 2014.50Because of the (at this writing) still “undetermined anomaly” that occurred justat touchdown, Philae was unable to fire its two anchoring harpoons into 67P’ssurface. Thus, the lander did not become safely attached to the surface, andbounced right back off 67P into space, to a height of over half a mile, beforegracefully (and oh, so slowly) falling back to 67P’s extremely rugged surface,over the course of two whole hours.According to the ESA analysis of “anomalous telemetry” received by Rosetta fromPhilae during this crucial and totally unplanned maneuver, thewashing-machine-sized spacecraft also sailed (in its bouncing parabolic arc)more than half a mile horizontally from the original touchdown point, beforecoming to rest (after one more, “mini” bounce) in the shadow of a massive,looming cliff! This was much to the dismay of the heart-stopped Philae groundcontrollers sitting three hundred million miles away in Darmstadt, Germany, homeof ESA’s “European Space Operations Centre” (ESOC), which is controlling theRosetta Mission.Telemetry from Philae, processed by the ESOC computers, soon revealed that thetoo-near cliff was blocking “all but 90 minutes of sunlight each ‘day’” out of67P’s full twelve-hour rotation period. Because of Philae’s angle to the sun,only a few watts of sunlight (at 67P’s distance from the center of the solarsystem) were even reaching Philae’s solar panels in that brief timewindow—resulting in the probe being forced to conduct all of its eleven highlyvaried, pre-planned scientific investigations of the comet within thesixty-five-hour life of its non-rechargeable primary battery.Pictured is an amazing time-lapse montage of images taken of Philae’s historiclanding approach on 67P,51 assembled by ESA from images shot over the space ofabout half an hour, from ten miles overhead, with the high-resolution OSIRIScamera aboard the Rosetta mothership.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_037_r1.jpg]Figure 37. In this amazing time-lapse Rosetta montage—taken Nov 12, 2014 duringPhilae’s historic descent to the surface of “Comet 67P/C-G”—we see a series oflong-distance “snapshots” of Philae (bottom left to top right), inset over amosaic of previous background comet surface images. Both sets were captured bythe hi-res OSIRIS camera aboard the Rosetta “mothership,” from a distance ofjust under ten miles.…A comparison of “before” and “after” landing insets (top right), reveals theremarkable imprint of Philae’s three, 16-foot-wide “tetrahedral landing pads” inthe dusty “comet” surface … before the spacecraft bounced over half a mile backinto space, eventually coming to rest over half a mile away (last inset, farright) from the initial “landing/bounce point.”Amazingly, despite losing irreplaceable hours after landing trying to understandthe nature (and the danger) of “the Big Bounce,” all the pre-planned Philaescientific experiments, once initiated, were completed successfully beforePhilae’s primary battery finally died and Philae was placed in electronic“standby mode.”The expectation was, based on calculations, that with the continued orbitalmovement of the comet around and closer to the sun over the next seven months,ever closer to “perihelion” (again, at this writing), it was predicted thatPhilae could, in fact, eventually store up enough solar energy to begintransmitting data—near the height of the expected “comet’s” activity nearperihelion. Perchance, just as Pluto is receiving its own first (modern)interplanetary visitor: New Horizons.Both events will potentially take place dramatically—simultaneously—in July2015.If the images sent to Earth from the Rosetta orbiter have been astonishing—interms of providing compelling scientific evidence of “ancient artificialstructures on 67P”—the few Philae images transmitted from the surface have nowadded crucial “ground truth” to that previous evidence … despite some additional“post-landing electronic anomalies” that inexplicably delayed the transmissionof those first surface images from Philae by over twenty-four hours.Pictured below is the first of two officially released ROLIS (Rosetta LanderImaging System), 57-degree-wide descent images, taken as the Philae lander wasslowly falling through 130 feet above the dusty surface.52[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_038_r1.jpg]Figure 38. This is the first of two officially-released ROLIS (Rosetta LanderImaging System) images, taken as the Philae Lander was slowly falling throughthe last ~130 feet above the dusty” comet” surface. The image is ~57 degrees(one radian) wide—to allow direct conversion of the “angular measure” of objectson the ground, into their absolute dimensions. Example: the size of the large“rock” (upper right)—calculated via Philae’s altitude (130 feet) and the frame’s“radian measure”—is about16 feet—the same as its observed width compared to the(known) 16-foot-wide span of Philae’s fully-extended landing legs (Figure 37).Also pictured is the same Philae image with added inset enlargements of several“highly anomalous geometric objects” appearing in the original130-foot-wide-frame.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_039_r1.jpg]Figure 39. This is the same Philae image as in Figure 38[Gros_9781583948989_epub_c03_r1.htm#fig038] … with enlargement of several“anomalously geometric objects” highlighted by insets. Given that geology, onthis scale, has no known processes capable creating such radically differentgeometries, in virtually zero gravity—and certainly in such close proximity—themore likely explanation is that these diverse geometric objects are exactly whatthey appear to be: pieces of abandoned, artificial “junk”—littering the surfaceof 67P from its epochs of former habitation. A detailed description of eachpotential artifact is included in the text.The large, apparent “boulder” seen in the upper right (approximately a dozenfeet across), on closer examination (inset) reveals a remarkable (if heavilyeroded) “symmetrical, right-angle, three-dimensional grid-pattern on its uppersurface”—reminiscent of some kind of “mechanical sub-systems” attached to itsexposed surface, rising out of the pervasive surrounding dust, and looking likean exposed portion of a half-buried, ancient machine. The middle-left insetreveals a remarkable “bladed-looking” artifact (clearly, not a “rock”) withninety-degree edges and parallel, opposing sides; a curious, “faceted knob” isattached to the “blade” at one end.Remarkably symmetric on one end, the long, flat object measures approximatelyfifteen feet long and four feet high—again, looking nothing like “a randomrock,” but something “carefully machined” (or, 3-D printed!).The final Philae enlargement focuses on a tantalizing, almost invisiblestructure hidden in the upper left-hand corner of the original ROLIS frame: anextremely dark (even on a “cometary” body—with an average 3 to 4 percentreflectivity!) object, the feature appears vaguely menacing and not at all“natural.” Multiple, much lower-resolution NavCam images confirm the reality ofthis dark structure, but shed no additional light on its function or purposewhen it was new. The diagonal black bar crossing the upper right-hand corner ofthe image is a section of Philae’s own landing gear, seen in silhouette againstthe “comet’s” surface. In the center of this image (above) is a small, bright,somewhat pointed feature (like a half-buried arrowhead) that becomes the focalpoint for the second, much closer ROLIS descent image (below).[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_040_r1.jpg]Figure 40. In this second ROLIS image, taken just 30 feet above the surface of67P, the largest object is a “pointed rock” about 5 feet across—with distinct,artificial-looking “flutes” seen prominently along one anomalously straight“double-edge.” On enlargement (inset), the “flutes” resolve to a series of“square, regular indentations”—arranged parallel to the left-handedge … connecting to another linear feature, also running parallel to that firstedge. Such multiple, redundant symmetries and right angles—in such a smallspace—are all-but-impossible to achieve by any known natural process, leaving“artificiality” as the only logical alternative. To any objective observer, what“leaps out” of this ultra-close-up 67P surface image, is the amazing number ofadditional, blatant examples of clearly “eroded, mechanical junk” in this onesmall, random image.… Why are such multiple examples of clearly ancient,manufactured objects … even there!?To any objective observer, what leaps out of this ultra-close-up 67P surface“aerial” image is the amazing number of blatantly geometric examples of “eroded,clearly mechanical junk” seen littering the “comet’s” surface, laid out lessthan thirty feet below the still descending Philae spacecraft; the number ofhighly-angular, highly symmetric and regularly-incised, clearly artificialfragments of once much larger, manufactured objects visible just in this smallarea (about one hundred feet square) is astonishing, and utterly “impossible.”Unless “comet” 67P is, in fact, a long-abandoned, once inhabited derelictspaceship (!) now eternally adrift in interplanetary space between the planetsMars and Jupiter within the classic “asteroid belt.”The presence of even one clearly mechanical object in these Rosetta and Philaeimages would violate every “natural” assumption rigidly held dear by planetaryscientists around the world; in this enlargement (below) of a portion of theROLIS image #2, something shiny appears: looking for all the world like theorphaned head of a very familiar-looking, very “human-looking” artifact—ahammer![images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_041_r1.jpg]Figure 41. “If I had a hammer.…” The presence of even one verified, clearlymechanical object on 67P would violate every “natural” assumption currentlyrigidly held dear by planetary scientists around the world; in this enlargementof a portion of the ROLIS image #2, something longer than wide,symmetrical … and very “shiny,” appears on 67P—looking, for all the world, likethe orphaned head of a very familiar … very human-looking artifact on Earth—ahammer!The odds of such a familiar, highly specific hammer-headed shape, randomlyappearing on the surface of such a tiny, completely alien “mini-world” overthree hundred million miles from Earth—along with all the other, equally“impossible” mechanical shapes sharing this same image—are simply beyondcalculation, being (at least) “trillions to one” against!Based on what is clearly visible in these two Philae surface frames, at whatpoint, then, will the professional geologists at ESA, NASA, and CNSA, in lookingat these two ROLIS descent images blatantly filled with “alien stuff,” throw uptheir hands and grudgingly admit what is obvious to any honest layman: “Allthese familiar-looking things just can’t be “geological!!”But, beyond all the abundant Rosetta and Philae imaging evidence confirming that“67P is not an ordinary ‘comet’—but, in fact, has all the appearance of ‘anancient, incredibly eroded, ‘mega-habitat’ in space,” 67P had one more surpriseto throw at us: a Signal.53The third potential “tipping point event” occurred November 11, 2014: ESA’ssudden announcement, just one day before Philae’s attempted landing on 67P, ofRosetta’s surprising detection of “a song”—coming from the “comet!”54The most remarkable feature of this “song” (which is being created, in themainstream model, by density variations in the electrified plasma—thecoma—enveloping the “comet,” creating resonant magnetic field variations in theprocess) was a very different … underlying … precisely clock-likefrequency—driving the ESA recording.If not caused by some obscure “cross-talk” issue in the magnetic instrumentaboard the Rosetta spacecraft itself (in which case, one would expect that ESAwould have explained that important caveat with their release of this new data),the remarkable machine-like precision of this underlying tone can only be due tosome kind of relatively small, repetitive, artificial process operatingsomewhere on—or in—the “comet!”Had the Europeans picked up (or, triggered with Rosetta) some kind of “torsionhoming beacon,” switched on by Rosetta’s close approach (within sixty miles) to67P in early August 2014? The actual detection (and then public admission) bythe Europeans of “some kind of signal emanating from 67P”—a signal having manyof the proposed characteristics I had written about only weeks before, in thisvery book, re: the possibility of “detecting a deliberate Torsion Homing Beacon”at Pluto, detectable by New Horizons as a means of identifying “an ancient solarsystem Archive”—was indescribably exhilarating. Was Rosetta’s confirmation ofthis unique, long-wave RF emission from 67P, a sign that this extraordinaryobject was, in fact, not only an “ancient ET spaceship” but also another“ancient solar system Archive!?”As the Rosetta mission has unfolded since last August, and the truly exoticnature of 67P has increasingly sunk in, celestial mechanics studies not onlyhave discovered that 67P “yesterday” (in “astronomical reckoning”)—in1959—experienced a major orbit change (after a gravitational encounter with themassive Jupiter); that close passage “shrank” 67P’s previous orbit, from aperihelion of 2.77 AU to a new (post-1959) orbit closest approach to the sun of1.29 AU.55As part of this inquiry into the long-term orbital history of Comet67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, celestial mechanics experts “ran the clock evenfurther back” before 1959 to a time thousands of years earlier, when, it wascalculated, 67P likely had first been captured in the inner solar system (again,via the far-reaching gravitational effects of Jupiter) … this time, from itsmuch vaster, original orbit in the outer solar system—in the Kuiper Belt.Was 67P then—as an original Kuiper Belt object—only a foreshadowing of thewonders still awaiting New Horizons and the rest of us, at Pluto … and beyond?Again, stay tuned.Notes1.

F. MARTELPluto appeared in the sky between the wars, as the Roaring Twenties gave way tothe Great Depression and the world continued its demented march toward Auschwitzand Hiroshima. Those two catastrophes were still years away; but already in1930, those who cared (or dared) to scry the forces at work behind the scenescould feel the rising heat.The great writer D. H. Lawrence was among these seers. In the opening to a novelreleased two years before Pluto made headlines, he observed that it is preciselybecause we live in tragic times that we reject a tragic vision of existence:“The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins.” A careful reader ofFriedrich Nietzsche, Lawrence knew that the social and political troubles of hisday were just the outward signs of a deeper crisis, one whose nature was asmetaphysical as it was socio-historical. As the plot of Lady Chatterley’s Loverillustrates, this crisis existed well beyond the theater of power politics: ittouched the most intimate areas of human life. This was something no treaty,social program, or League of Nations could fix, a collective “loss of soul”operating at pandemic levels.It was in the midst of this crisis that astronomers located the obscure objecttheir calculations had assured them existed at the edge of our solar system. Butbefore talking about Pluto, I want to delve a little deeper into the situationin which it emerged, so as to better understand its imaginal significance.Nietzsche had put his finger on the nub of the problem two generations beforeLawrence with his proclamation of the death of God. While at one level, thestatement “God is dead” is squarely aimed at the Christian deity, in the contextof Nietzsche’s overall philosophy it has a much wider scope. “Christianity” isthe name Nietzsche gives to what he considers to be the most sophisticatedarticulation of an ancient, deep-rooted cultural asceticism, endemic to theWest. It is essentially a form of nihilism, entailing a metaphysical denial ofthe body-soul in favor of a transcendent principle in whose searing light ourworld appears as mere shadow. From its place beyond the confines of matter andpsyche, the transcendent object—what Nietzsche calls “God”—becomes the basis foruniversal moral judgment in this world. It determines right and wrong, truth andfalsehood; but since it is outside of space-time it can’t communicate with usdirectly: a priest (or other expert) is required to judge the living and thedead in its name. This life-denying attitude derives from what Nietzsche calleda “spirit of vengeance” that has driven Western culture since the days ofSocrates. It is a force that sucks the lifeblood out of embodied being,effectively imposing on everyone an infinite spiritual debt that can never berepaid.The most subtle and virulent form of asceticism for Nietzsche isn’t theChristian faith per se but modern secularism, with its enshrinement ofmetaphysical truth as a thing of intrinsic moral value. That is why Nietzschefollows up the proclamation “God is dead” with the warning that even in death,the shadow of God “still looms” … and will continue to do so for a long time.The doctrine of truth—which persists in the humanities as well as thesciences—is the ghost of God, the pesky vestige of a principle whose unrealityhas already disclosed itself in the collective psyche.Over and above its indictment of the old cosmic patriarch, “God is dead” is amantra signaling the disappearance of any principle on which one might hang anabsolute, the vanishing of the very basis for positing universal values of anykind. For Nietzsche the news is both good and bad. It is good news because, therug of transcendence having being pulled from under our feet, it is only amatter of time before we are forced to adopt a different way of being. But it isalso bad news, because the realization that transcendence is a fiction is sotraumatic that we may well destroy ourselves sooner than embrace a new modality.The way I understand it, the Nietzschean demotion of truth doesn’t mean thattruth is nonexistent. Nietzsche is talking about the end of truth as amonolithic value deserving unquestioned devotion in the manner of an idol. Asthe French thinker Gilles Deleuze explains in a beautiful treatise onNietzschean philosophy, it isn’t a question of whether truth exists but whetherall truths are equal—and most importantly, whether truth as such is necessarilygood. “There are imbecile thoughts, imbecile discourses, that are made upentirely of truths; but these truths are base, they are those of a base, heavyand leaden soul,” he writes.1 Consider the know-it-all who would dismiss apoetic description of the sunrise because “actually, the sun doesn’t rise, it’sthe Earth that’s turning,” or the historicist who would repudiate therevolutionary by reminding her that “all revolutions turn out badly in the end.”Both make use of base truths to undermine more profound ones. Their truths are“base” because they shrink the horizon of the possible, they presuppose a worldthat can be conquered by the intellect and that can be judged, as opposed to onethat exceeds every ideation. The acolytes of truth want to banish all sense of auniverse in which something new might arise at any moment to challenge our mostbasic suppositions as to the nature of the real.“Illusions” such as sunrises, revolutions, and works of art can contain truthsthat, while having no basis in hardcore actuality, are more expansive andsignificant than any plain statement of fact. Indispensable though they may befrom an empirical standpoint, facts speak only what has been the case in thepast: they have no claim on the real potentialities of the now. So it isn’ttruth as such that Nietzsche said must come to an end so much as a “human, alltoo human” understanding of truth. Likewise, it wasn’t God himself whose deathNietzsche proclaimed, but a similarly too-human conception of the divine.The modern crisis encapsulated in the mantra “God is dead” is an epistemic one:it involves the way we think about the world rather than the world itself. Theway Deleuze puts it in his interpretation of Nietzsche, modernity has replacedknowledge with belief. It is this switch from knowing to believing that haschanged the situation. We can’t claim to truly know anything anymore. Even thesolidity of matter becomes suspect in the light of modern ideas of nature andthe cosmos. The Enlightenment quest for truth has revealed uncertainty to be aninextricable attribute of human thought. The best we can do today is to believewe know. In this sense it is we, and not the Australian aborigines, who live inDreamtime, rowing merrily down the stream of a life that’s but a dream. The Westhas shattered its dearest illusions to uncover levels of the real that won’tconform to its own metaphysical ideals. We are just taking our sweet timeacknowledging it. Hence the crisis.While in daily life we continue to act as though everything were OK, an abyssyawns beneath ordinary consciousness, a groundlessness the horror writer ThomasLigotti called the “Shadow at the Bottom of the World.”2 If the old transcendentgod continues to haunt us in a secular guise, demanding that we persist inholding absolute truths despite the evidence of our thoughts, it is because onlythrough this belief can we trick ourselves out of facing the void. And so wefight the shadow of the abyss with the shadow of God. Here I return to theopening of Lady Chatterley’s Lover:Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. Thecataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new littlehabitats, to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now nosmooth road into the future: but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles.We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.3We’ve got to go on, because stopping would mean confronting the imponderablefact that we have been divested of every line of defense against the totalwhat-the-fuckness of it all. The only absolute remaining behind the mirages andthe chicanery of obsolete transcendence is absolute unknowing, absolute mystery.Anyone who has had a bona fide panic attack knows what I mean by“groundlessness.” The fear comes on when the egoic mind hits on the untruth oftruth, or the truth of untruth. The world suddenly takes on a cold, menacingglare. It doesn’t become meaningless; rather, it comes alive with meaningsemanating from an inhuman presence beyond comprehension, an alien intelligencewhose indifference to our plight gives it an aura of malignancy and cruelty. In1927, three years before the Pluto discovery, Martin Heidegger’s Being and Timeproposed that anxiety wasn’t a mental disturbance but the only sane reaction tothe actual nature of reality. Anxiety, for Heidegger, is the “fundamental mood,”the modern mindset par excellence—that which brings us closest to the essence ofBeing.Modern humans are adrift in the unknowable, the most potent image of which maybe the immeasurable vastness of outer space through which Planet Earth waftslike a wad of spit from the mouth of Cthulhu. It’s true that there is noshortage of religions, philosophical models, esoteric traditions, and spiritualpractices for those who seek to make sense of the situation (myself included).However, it is impossible to entertain any one of these models of belief withoutbeing aware of the fact that it exists as one “option” among many. Whether theone I pick is the most adequate is anyone’s guess, especially when I realizethat there are very smart people vouching for almost every position. We live ina metaphysically flat time, with all of these different models existing on thesame theoretical plane.Be that as it may, mystical experiences, magical encounters, extraplanarflights, synchronistic happenings, and prophetic visions still abound. That isheartening because it tells us that secular materialism is really just one moreoption on the table, not the sober default its proponents would like it to be.On the other hand, even the most miraculous occurrence cannot restore the groundwe have lost. A dozen mystics will return from the otherworld with a dozendifferent maps of meaning. And while we can think our way to a synthesis thatmakes, say, G. I. Gurdjieff’s cosmology compatible with Rudolph Steiner’s, thecritical differences in need of bridging are a case in point. It isn’t that themystics are wrong; evidently, Gurdjieff and Steiner saw something—somethingimportant—in their visions. But in turning this something into a set ofcommunicable ideas, they altered it in a significant way. The figurations of thereal described by Gurdjieff, Steiner, and others seem to have as much to do withwho did the seeing as they do with what was seen—and that is modernity defined.As Carl Jung observes in the Red Book, if a new divinity, a new ground, shouldarise, it must inhere in the relative, that is to say the mysterious, theinnately ambivalent: both/and as opposed to either/or. The pluralism thatcharacterizes the spiritual scene today is not going away. We must somehow findour footing in groundlessness itself.The discovery of Pluto coincides with the modern revelation of groundlessness.Synchronistically speaking, Pluto is the emissary of the death of God,expressing it through the death god’s return to mass consciousness.It is worth noting that Pluto is not equivalent to the Christian devil (thatdubious honor goes to Pan). In fact Pluto hardly appears at all in the Christianmythos, with good reason. For what room is there for the personification ofnothingness in a cosmos where nothingness was done away with on the First Day?If there is one thing that traditional Christianity did splendidly, it was toreassure people that death was not a void, that the personality survived itintact. (It is true that it still does this for millions of Christians today.But again, modern Christians believe their creed with the full knowledge that itis one possibility among many. Far from being self-evident, contemporaryChristianity must vie with its competitors. It therefore contains doubt as aconstitutive element.) In the traditional Christian worldview, death isn’t areal event but an optical illusion to be dispelled on the Day of Judgment. Thefact that the body expires is completely irrelevant, because time and spacethemselves are irrelevant in the Kingdom of God.It was the decline of Christianity as the preeminent Western mindset thatallowed for the reemergence of Death as an archetype, and Pluto must be seen inthe light of this epochal return. After Pluto, death once again becomes theultimate horizon it had been for the people of antiquity. During the Cold War,its presence took the form of the atomic bomb (remember the key role ofplutonium in making nuclear weapons), while today it looms above us still in theguise of global climate change (an eventuality that evokes a singularlyPlutonian image of the Earth as a dead planet). Pluto can—should, I think—beinterpreted as a symbol of the finality of death in a cosmos deprived of themetaphysical axis required to give existence an intelligible teleology.We have been living under the sign of Pluto now for nearly a century, which mayexplain part of our fascination with doomsday scenarios. Nor does the fact thatPluto may have lost its official status as a planet indicate a change in thesituation. It only makes sense that a planet named Pluto would turn out to be adubious planet in the end: its namesake was the god who was not a god. In theancient world Pluto was a deity without a temple, shrine, or cult, an invisiblepower dwelling apart from his Olympian siblings in the dank and lonelyunderworld. As James Hillman said, Pluto is the entity who has no substantialexistence and yet in whose presence all things become manifest.4 Whether asplanet, planetoid, or “swarm,” to borrow Richard Grossinger’s term, Plutoremains what it is: the outer limit of our groundless world. Our black horizon.Since I started thinking about this, it has occurred to me that I am able tosummon up a mental image of every major Roman god except Pluto. When I try, Iget the image of Mickey Mouse’s pet dog instead. Incidentally, Pluto the Dog wasborn the same year Pluto the God reincarnated as Planet X (though it took until1931 for him to get his name). Is it going too far to see a connection here?Think about it: just one year after a previously unknown object is named Plutoon account of its darkness, invisibility, and ambiance of futility, a ridiculouscartoon character bearing the same name enters popular consciousness with enoughpunch to become the first thing that pops into most heads when they hear theP-word. Silly as it seems, my sense is that Disney gave us Pluto the Dog as adistraction from the revelations of Pluto the God. Just as the three-headed dogCerberus guards the doors of Hades, so Disney’s bumbling mutt (and the wholeentertainment culture he stands for) protects our day-world from the groundlessnight whose sign was Pluto.Disney’s scheme to defeat a god with a dog was by all appearances unconscious.In all probability, Walt just liked the sound of the word. But that doesn’tnecessarily raise doubts about the scheme’s intentionality. By their fruits yeshall know them: ever since the wars we have been bombarded by cartoonysilliness, the purpose of which is to distract us from the increasingly direrealities hemming us in, be they political, economic, or ecological. There is no“they” doing it; we are doing it to ourselves, because we do not want to seethat the ground is gone, that, as Alan Moore puts it, “the world is rudderless.”If this deployment of Pluto the Dog—and of the incessant fantasia that followedhim—was unconscious, it should come as no surprise that it revealed more than itwould have if it had been a deliberate tactic. In his very first appearance in a1930 animated film, Pluto (then named Rover) accompanies Mickey and Minnie on aroadside picnic. While the talking mice dance around the meadow in blissfulignorance, wild animals proceed to devour every scrap of food they have brought,proving Pluto to be rather sub-par as a guard dog. Then a storm erupts, puttinga soggy end to the proceedings, and Mickey finally finds a use for the dog bysitting him on the windshield and making him use his tail as a wiper for therain.Even in this first attempt to upstage the death god, the ultimate futility ofthe enterprise betrays itself. Pluto the Dog is no match for Cerberus, theindifferent monstrosity of nature. Eighty-five years after the film’s release,the storm has indeed broken over the picnic that is consumer society. Spectacleis becoming less effective at distracting us from the unfolding disaster. LikeMickey and Minnie, we are stranded in the rain with our cartoon dog. The hubrisof Enlightenment had us strutting for a while; but today our invention andcleverness are turning against us, and we must struggle to reverse the processeswe ourselves have set in motion. The future has never looked quite as Plutonianas it does now. Within a few centuries’ time, Earth itself may look as deservingof the name Pluto as any other lifeless space rock.We cannot go on imagining that we are the center of the universe or that we haveGod’s number. Pluto’s lesson, I think, is the same as it was when it appeared onthe astrological horizon: a lesson of humility. We have been postponing it foralmost a hundred years. If humanity is to survive the transition fromtranscendence to immanence foretold by Nietzsche, we must learn to fall to ourknees again—only this time, it can’t be before our own image. We must learn tobow before the mystery itself, and embrace it as the basis of a new religiosity.Pluto’s reappearance in the modern era calls us back to a time when the deathgod was acknowledged, however quietly, as an essential dimension of thephenomenal world. Perhaps it is in the nature of this god to reveal that all ofour perambulations have been circular, and that we stand today in the sameposition as the ancient Greeks did when the tragedy of existence brought themface to face with him. Even then, people wanted to turn away and remain blind,like the characters in Lady Chatterley’s Lover, to the tragic nature of a tragicsituation. But then as now there were exceptions. Called “the Obscure” by hiscontemporaries, the fifth century BC philosopher Heraclitus spoke in a languageno one understood. Even the tone of his writings suggests he was writing for thepeople of another time. My sense is that Heraclitus was writing for us now,albeit even in 2015 he is perhaps best described as a philosopher of the future.Heraclitus is one of the few thinkers to have the courage to seize on becomingas the deepest stratum of Being. In his philosophy, Being has no fixity: what isis insofar as it changes, and changes constantly. Groundlessness was Heraclitus’rule: he was able to look out at the world without projecting a transcendentalaxis to stabilize the vision into a tolerable dream. Flux, for him, was the onlytruth … the truth of untruth. Even the most sophisticated ideas or conceptscould not in his eyes do justice to the whole.Heraclitus famously remarked that the Eternal was not a patriarch like Yahweh orZeus, but a “child at play.” What he called the “Logos” was the form of changeitself, the pure difference inhering in all things, endlessly incarnating itselfthrough acts of creation and experimentation. Long before Nietzsche, Heraclitusknew that God was dead, but this didn’t stop him from speaking of God as Logos.This isn’t a moralistic God, but it is not an immoral one either: the Logos istransmoral, encompassing the reality of good and evil, yet subsuming them insomething bigger. Nor is it useful to argue over whether this force of Becomingbelongs to order or chaos: it is both/and, what James Joyce called a “chaosmos.”Heraclitus can serve as the beginning of a spirituality of immanence that allowsmeaning and purpose to survive, in new forms, in a post-transcendent world. Inhim, we find a vision that philosophy turned away from just as it was gettingstarted, but that artists have embraced, often unconsciously, since the dawn oftime. It took two and a half thousand years of transcendental idealizing toreach the point where the fiction won’t stick anymore. Circumstances have madeit such that, terrible or not, the pre-Socratic Heraclitean vision of eternalflux imposes itself on all of us. The survival of our species seems to hinge onwhether or not we are able to accept it.Throughout his career, Carl Jung implored us to turn to our own personaldarkness, recognize our shadows, and stop projecting them onto other people andinstitutions. “We are the origin of all coming evil,” he said. The globalcatastrophe that is upon us now is a direct outcome of our refusal to face thehorror. When the great anthropologist Knud Rasmussen asked the Inuit shaman Auawhat his people believed, the latter replied: “We do not believe. We fear.”Meaning: we see that no belief can encompass the whole, and that it is preciselyin hypostatizing metaphysical models of the totality that we blind ourselves toBecoming and expose ourselves to danger. Aua knew that it takes tremendouscourage to fear consciously. Traditional Inuit culture has no God—no univocal,monolithic signifier. Nevertheless it has thrived in the harshest climate onEarth for millennia and enabled some of the most penetrating explorations of theimaginal realm that have ever been undertaken, in terms of both shamanicpractice and artistic creation. I mention this because there are some who, uponhearing the phrase “God is dead,” think that it means the end of spiritualitybecause in God’s absence, the dimension of the sacred evaporates. In fact, Ithink it’s the opposite: only once God is dead (or, what is more exact from aPlutonian perspective, only once God is death) do the most expansive visions ofthe divine become possible. Here we stand not only with the shamans and artists,but also with the great mystics of the organized religions, all of whomexperienced, in solitude, the atheistic crisis that we are about to undergo as acivilization.In some esoteric passages Deleuze speaks of the importance of “affirmingchance.” I interpret this to mean a few things. First, it means accepting thateverything the egoic subject wishes were the case (destiny, truth, divinejustice, deliverance, even enlightenment) are only relatively true. In givingthem an absolute status we effectively construct an image of the world that mustbe reaffirmed against all the vicissitudes of reality, which contradict it atevery turn. Second, to affirm chance means to recognize that vaporizing ourfictions (“killing the Buddha,” as they say in Zen) can be as liberating as itis terrifying. The ego gives in to a deeper selfhood that, though it is nolonger reducible to a personality, opens up new possibilities. Indeed, throughthe affirmation of chance literally everything becomes possible, since thedivine judgment that limited the scope of the real is finally consigned tosilence. Third, affirming chance means recognizing that the mystery of being isone that no religious gnosis, philosophical system, or scientific discovery willever solve. Existence inheres in mystery, not in the sense that the riddle oflife has a final answer we don’t yet know, but in the sense that knowing—actually getting to the bottom of anything—is simply something we humans don’tdo. Truth ceases to be a function of power by which one might pass judgmentsabout what is real or unreal, possible or impossible, only when we recognizethat mystery is constitutive of reality as such. It is through this interruptionin the closed circuit of the cosmos that the holy gets in. It is ingroundlessness that the sacred comes to permeate every particle of the world.In one fragment, Heraclitus states that Pluto and Dionysus are one and thesame.5 At first glance, no two gods could seem more opposed to one another thanthese two. Pluto is the lugubrious king of silence and death, Dionysus the wildprince of music and life. But on closer inspection the equation bears out.Dionysus is the god who descends into Hades in order to rise again as the“twice-born.” He is the one who, by accepting death as a dimension of life, isable to attain to the plenitude. In Nietzsche’s philosophy, Dionysus embodiesall that is “active” in the universe, all those creative forces that precede andovercome the “passive” passions of the reactive self, which for their partsecrete only nihilism and judgment.6 The active forces encompass those aspectsof life that the instruments of reason cannot measure: magic, miracles,synchronicity, vision, creation, self-giving … Though they are as present todayas they always have been, the active forces can now only manifest in the privateexperience of isolated individuals or small groups of people—their realitycannot be shared at the societal level. I think the time is coming when it willbe necessary for our civilization to see them once more as an integral part ofthe universe.The apocalypse announced by Pluto in 1930 is now upon us. Night is falling. Ifwe continue to resist, then we will almost certainly descend into a true andfinal darkness. But perhaps there is still a chance to come to terms with theshadow at the bottom of the world, to tap into its dark energy in order totransform our world and ourselves into some new form of being. Could that bewhat the aptly-named Grateful Dead were getting at with those obscure lines fromtheir Plutonian ode, “Dark Star”: “Shall we go, you and I while we can, /Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?”7Notes1.

He is himselfinvisible, which could imply that the invisible connection is Hades, and thatthe essential “what” that holds things in their form is the secret of theirdeath. And if, as Heraclitus said, Nature loves to hide, then nature lovesHades.Hades is said to have had no temples or altars in the upper world and hisconfrontation with it is experienced as a violence, a violation (Persephone’srape; the assaults on simple vegetative nymphs, Leuce and Minthe; and Iliad 5,395 or Pindar Ol 9, 33). He is so invisible in fact that the entire collectionof Greek antique art shows no ideal portrait of Hades, such as we are familiarwith of other gods.He had no representative attributes, except an eagle, which brings out hisshadowy affiliation with his brother, Zeus. He leaves no trace on Earth, for noclan descends from him, no generations.Hades’s name was rarely used. At times he was referred to as “the unseen one,”more often as Pluto (“wealth,” “riches”) or as Trophonios (“nourishing”). Thesedisguises of Hades have been taken by some interpreters to be euphemisms for thefear of death, but then why this particular euphemism and not some other?Perhaps Pluto is a description of Hades, much as Plato understood this god.Then, Pluto refers to the hidden wealth or the riches of the invisible. Hence,we can understand one reason why there was no cult and no sacrifice to him—Hadeswas the wealthy one, the giver of nourishment to the soul. Sometimes, he wasfused with Thanatos (“Death”) of whom Aeschylus wrote, “Death is the only Godwho loves not gifts and cares not for sacrifices or libation, who has no altarsand receives no hymns …” (frg. Niobe). On vase paintings when Hades is shown, hemay have his face averted, as if he were not even characterized by a specificphysiognomy. All this “negative” evidence does coalesce to form a definite imageof a void, an interiority or depth that is unknown but nameable, there and felteven if not seen. Hades is not an absence, but a hidden presence—even aninvisible fullness.Etymological investigations into the root word for death demon show it to mean“hider.”To grasp better the ways in which Hades hides invisibly in things, let us takeapart this concept, listening for the hidden connections, the metaphors, withinthe word hidden itself: (1) buried, shrouded, concealed from eyesight, whether acorpse or a mysterium; (2) occult, esoteric, concealed in the sense of secret;(3) that which per se cannot be seen: non-visible as non-spatial, non-extended;(4) without light: dark, black; (5) that which cannot be seen on inspection,i.e., blocked, censored, forbidden, or obscured; (6) hidden, as contained within(interior) or as contained below (inferior), where the Latin cella(“subterranean storeroom”) is cognate with the Old Irish cuile (“cellar”) andcel (“death”), again cognate with our hell; (7) that which is experienced withdread and terror, a void, a nothing; (8) that which is experienced as hiding,e.g., withdrawing, turning away from life; (9) stealth, surreptitiousness,deceit, such as the hidden motives and unseen connections of Hermes. In short,Hades, the hidden hider, presides over both the crypt and cryptic, which givesto Heraclitus’ phrase (frg. 123): “Nature loves to hide” (physis kryptesthaiphilei) a subtle and multiple implication indeed.Some say that the cap or helmet Hades wears belongs primarily to Hermes and mayhave little or nothing to do with Hades.This hat is a curious phenomenon: Hermes wears it, Hades wears it; Athene putsit on to beat Ares, and Perseus to overcome the Gorgon. It makes its wearerinvisible. Evidently the explicit image of connection between Hermes and Hades(announced in the Homeric “Hymn to Hermes”) is the headdress. Hermes and Hadesshare a certain style of covering their heads that both hides their thoughts andperceives hidden thoughts. It is their intentions that become invisible. Wecannot perceive where their “heads are at,” though we may have the sense of ahidden watch over our inmost thoughts. Because we can never discover what theircovert minds intend, we consider them deceptive, unpredictable, frightening—orwise.When we consider the House of Hades, we must remember that the myths—and Freudtoo—tell us that there is no time in the underworld. There is no decay, noprogress, no change of any sort. Because time has nothing to do with theunderworld, we may not conceive the underworld as “after” life, except as theafterthoughts within life. The House of Hades is a psychological realm now, notan eschatological realm later. It is not a far-off place of judgment over ouractions but provides that place of judging now, and within, the inhibitingreflection interior to our actions.This simultaneity of the underworld with the daily world is imaged by Hadescoinciding indistinguishably with Zeus, or identical with Zeus chthonios. Thebrotherhood of Zeus and Hades says that upper and lower worlds are the same;only the perspectives differ. There is only one and the same universe,coexistent and synchronous, but one brother’s view sees it from above andthrough the light, the other from below and into its darkness. Hades’s realm iscontiguous with life, touching it at all points, just below it, its shadowbrother (Doppelgänger) giving to life its depth and its psyche.Because his realm was conceived as the final end of each soul, Hades is thefinal cause, the purpose, the very telos of every soul and every soul process.If so, then all psychic events have a Hades aspect, and not merely the sadisticor destructive events that Freud attributed to Thanatos. All soul processes,everything in the psyche, moves toward Hades. As the finis is Hades, so thetelos is Hades. Everything would become deeper, moving from the visibleconnections to the invisible ones, dying out of life. When we search for themost revelatory meaning in an experience, we get it most starkly by letting itgo to Hades, asking what has this to do with “my” death. Then essence standsout.Here too Hades has bearing on psychological theory. A psychology that emphasizesthe final point of view—Jung’s, for instance, and Adler’s—is restating the Hadesperspective, even if these psychologies do not go right to the end of theirends. I mean by this that the finalism in psychology seems to shy away from thefull consequences of mythology, in which the finalism is not a theory only butis the experience in soul of its call to Hades.Now hold here a moment. Let us beware of taking this call as literal death, ofwhich so much is spoken and written today, that we begin to believe we know allabout what we know nothing about. Literal death is becoming a clichéd mystery,that is, we have best-seller evidence about the unknowable.Rather, by the call to Hades I am referring to the sense of purpose that enterswhenever we talk about soul. What does it want? What is it trying to say (inthis dream, this symptom, experience, problem)? Where is my fate orindividuation process going? If we stare these questions in the face, of coursewe know where our individuation process is going—to death. This unknowable goalis the one absolutely sure event of the human condition. Hades is the unseen oneand yet absolutely present.The call to Hades suggests that all aspects of the process of the soul must beread finally, not only as part of the general human process toward death, but asparticular events of and in that death. Each facet then is a finished image initself, completing its purpose that is at the same time unending, not literallyunending in time but limitless in depth. In other words, we can stop nowhere—andanywhere—because the end is not in time but in death, where death means thetelos or fulfillment of anything, or, we can stop anywhere, because from thefinal point of view everything is an end in itself. The goal is always now.A true finalistic psychology will show its ends in its means. We will be able tosee its end goal of death in the methods it uses to work toward it. Therefore,to live fully into the consequences of the finalistic view means to bear theperspective of Hades and the underworld toward each psychic event. We ask: whatis the purpose of this event for my soul, for my death? Such questions extendthe dimension of depth without limit, and again psychology is pushed by Hadesinto an imperialism of soul, reflecting the imperialisms of his kingdom and theradical dominion of death.Notes1.

He was ruler over the deceased also. The character of thisrulership was the darkness and the formless invisibility (shadows). His dwellingwas in the depths and, therefore, “domos Aides,” he himself was Aides orAidoneus, i.e., the invisible. An old symbol of this invisibility is theso-called helmet or Hood des Aides, which conforms to the hiding cape inGermanic mythology. The hood is made from the scalp of a dog. The helmetproducing invisibility is the symbol of the rulership of Pluto over theinvisible. After the fall of his father, Kronos (Saturn), he received thenether-worlds, at the time of the partition of the world, where he rules at theside of Persephone (Latin: Proserpina), whom he had kidnapped. He was the son ofKronos and Rhea, and brother of Zeus and Poseidon.Pluto, who was the antithesis of the God of the Sun, Apollo, at first passed asthe irreconcilable enemy of all new life, into which he continually sent deathand destruction. But there is another, milder version of this myth:The people also knew of this God of Death and the lower world, but more fromlife in nature. They were much better acquainted with the image of a creativeactive god living inside of the earth, and similar to the Italianic God,Tollumo, a god of fecundation, Pluto, therefore, passed as an active god insidethe earth, a god of the bounties of the earth and distributor of riches. Inaddition to believing him as connected with the bounties of grain, he was alsothought of as related to prosperity in mining. He was also known by other names,such as Host, Hunter, Zeus of the deceased, assembler of the people, the equaldistributor (judge, administrator of Justice). Sometime Hades-Pluto was called“the door-keeper” and he was pictured with a key in his hand.The whole surrounding of Pluto was thought to be very sad and gloomy. Peoplepictured the place of the underworld as a region rich in volcanic nature andgloomy appearing natural phenomena, with cave-like passages, hot springs andmephitic effluvia. Sacred to Pluto was the narcissus and the cypress, as well asthe adiantum (maidenhair). Black sheep were sacrificed to him with avertedfaces.….As to the fundamental nature of Pluto, he is a mixture of water and fire.Contrasts prevail here, but the contrasts are such as to combine and supplement.Water extinguishes fire, while fire turns water into vapor. Pluto is the planetof self-rediscovery, or the union of these two elements. However, the waterprinciple is the stronger. Thus, we recognize once again the close connectionbetween Pluto and the zodiacal sign Scorpio.Pluto has a kinship with Jupiter in that he is multiform and gives abundancewith extreme goals. Yet from these extremes an amalgamation results. On accountof its enormous driving force, Pluto tries to seek new connections again andagain.If we desire to grasp the characteristics of Pluto correctly, we must firstclearly understand that Pluto is a polarity, a “double-boundedness.” Pluto has adouble face—a Janus face—and we must distinguish between two evolutions, i.e., alower and a higher vibration, similar to those of the sign Scorpio.…Pluto kills or destroys but builds out of the elements of the destroyed—out ofthe old, something new; Pluto rises from the ashes like the phoenix. Pluto istransformations—transformations of one force into another force, of one elementinto another; it is transmutation and the “alchemistra redivivius.”Pluto is connection, transition, passage, bridge, boundary; the end and at thesame time the beginning; it unbinds and binds; it brings revolutionaryupheavals; it is the turning point. Pluto leads from torpidity to revival; fromone condition—one condition of consciousness—into another, from one being intoanother being, from this life into the life hereafter. For this reason Pluto hasbeen called in mythology the lord of the realm of the dead, the realm between,the astral world. Pluto is the overthrow of the old, sensing the new: the end ofthe old world and the ascent of a new spiritual epoch.It is therefore not a mere chance that Pluto was discovered on the borderline oftwo ages, the turning point of human evolution. If Uranus is the first stage ofthe coming Aquarian age, then Pluto is the second stage. Pluto leads out ofdeath, rigidity, a cramped state, through the stage of fermentation, preparationand development to revival, enlightenment, elevation, and clarification. Plutowill lead humanity out of the mechanization and mechanical technology of ourtimes into an epoch of revivification, resurrection, of magic and creativepower.The Plutonic force acts in a renewing, enlivening, reviving manner, bringingforth the new; it is stimulating, preparatory, enthusiastic, breaking forth,breaking open, arousing, germinating, up-stirring, up-rooting, eruptive,up-raising, revealing, reorganizing, revolutionary. However, it is notrevolutionary in the sense that Uranus is. Pluto brings only that which has beendeveloped under cover, in secret (underground) into daylight, when the time isripe. The force of Pluto is like wine in the stage of fermentation, which isworking until it has gained access to air, or like a volcano that bubbles andseethes inside until it erupts with elementary force.Seething, boring, hatching, brooding, evaporating, decomposing, fermenting,transforming; disunion, germination, procreation—all these are Plutocharacteristics. All chemical and transforming processes, distillation,chemistry, spagyric, alchemy, metamorphosis—all belong to Pluto.…Pluto is an exalted yet sublimated scorpion-like Mars, and is in the first placethe purest, highest, potentialized mental energy, or creative willpower, similarto that possessed by the “magic man” (fakir, yogi, magician, adept, artist,genius).The following is a preliminary compilation:(a) On the material plane: Death, destruction, decomposition, struggle, force,fanaticism, adventurous desires, temptation, defiance, envy, intensification,sensuality.(b) On the spiritual plane: Regeneration, reorganization, transformation,transmutation, creator of new life-giving force, form impulse; gives energy tostrive for spiritual power and leadership, conscious clairvoyance, magic,mystic, magnetism, exaltation.…All large earth movements, eruptions, geologic displacements, earthquakescovering a larger range, are under the influence of Pluto. Uranus causes thesudden shocks of a more local nature. Pluto is in many respects anintensification of the Uranian influence, especially in regard to suchconditions that are released through impact and energy. So in this respect,Uranus and Pluto supplement, intensify, and vie, so to speak, with each other.However, the effect of Pluto is never so surprising and sudden as in the case ofUranus.Pluto conceals within himself a very important physical law: the ability toovercome the force of gravity and air pressure. In this category belong all thebold and adventurous technical problems involved in stratosphere flight, rocketflight, and the exploration of the great ocean deeps.…Just like the other slow-moving planets, Pluto defines more favorable orunfavorable periods, rather than certain dates. The influence of the Plutotransit cannot be fixed to a certain day. It is possible, however, to narrowdown the time of the release if one observes which directions or similartransits are due at the period influence of the transit of Pluto. My presentexperience indicates that one does not get too far by allowing three to fouryears for the periods of influence for the Pluto transit. Pluto’s influence is,however, not always at its strongest when the aspect is exact. The effect ofPluto, above all, is felt, similar to Saturn, when the aspect is separating andonly seldom in its application; the majority of the aspects were released 1 to 2degrees after the exact point, as far as I have been able thus far toascertain.…According to my observations, the strongest effects have been the transits ofPluto over the cusps of the angles, over the Sun, Moon, and the superiorplanets, especially of his neighbors, Neptune and Uranus, and relatively, theweakest are the transits over Mercury and Venus.Transits over the ascendant bring revolutionizing tendencies, a turnabout indevelopment, an awakening of latent powers, turning points in the course oflife, and the beginning of an entirely new phase in destiny. This is a time ofdecisions, temptation, trials, an enormous test of power, self-examination, anda standing at the parting of the ways. For many, it is the baptism with fire; ofbringing forth the last urge one can master, creating intensified impulses andinstincts. The nature wrestles with deep problems.The favorable transits, and also the conjunction in the few cases where one canclassify it as favorable (for instance), bring the tendency to strengthen thephysical powers, and give record performances, both bodily and spiritually; ofbeing entrusted with a special mission; an increase in the native’s personalinfluence; an unexpected rise; an impetus toward experience that shapes thefuture; a raised receptivity toward astral influences or inspiration.The unfavorable transits are outspoken danger signals and as a rule bringenormous exertion of the native’s personal strength; strong emotional upsets;grave illnesses, and danger of accidents. There may be diseases of the blood,heavy blows of fate which often occur in series; sacrifice; renunciation; deathof very near persons, also dangers to the native’s own life. If other similarconfigurations occur, death may come.…Uranus and Neptune can be classified as the forerunners of Pluto. Uranus, whichwas the first in the row of trans-Saturnian planets, acted as an evolutionizing,revolutionizing force; he brought inventions and set technic upon the throne.Uranus also represents the first knowledge of transcendental matters, and thefirst bridge between matter and spirit. The influence of Uranus is not yetpurely spiritual, but more material-spiritual.As a continuance of the Uranian influence and his first awakening of a new epochin time, Neptune at first brought confusion and chaos into human experiencebecause his influence was not understood. But later, as mankind tried more andmore to sense the fine and subtle vibrations of Neptune, he brought submersioninto and deepening of the spiritual problems and mysticism.Now, under the influence of the successively intensity increasing vibrations ofPluto, not only the individual person, but the entire race, feels that somethingdifferent is coming, something new, something yet entirely unknown; somethingwhich is not yet laid down in books; something of which one part of the peopleis afraid and which the other awaits with longing—the new age.Every human being living will be convinced that he harbors in himself not onlyearthly things, but also heavenly gifts. Pluto breaks with the materialistic,mammonistic spirit of time and leads us across into an idealistic epoch withhigher and purer aims for mankind. But this way leads through struggle andsacrifice because Pluto is struggle, a struggle until purification is reached.Pluto is the borderline between two events—the decline of the old and the riseof the new era—the instigator of the turn in world events. But because Pluto isa planet which knows no pardon, no hindrance and no delay, which pursues his waycalmly, its influence is consequently not felt in a soft manner, but on thecontrary, it is very forceful and brutal. Pluto’s destiny is to clean up the oldand to march before the new era in a new form with its second luminous face ofJanus proclaiming and bringing happiness and joy.…If Uranus is the awakener, Neptune the perceiver, then Pluto is the fulfillmentof the new spiritual era. With the discovery of this trans-Neptunian planet, thenew spiritual epoch entered upon its deciding stage. The first connection thatPluto formed after its discovery, with another great planet, was the square toUranus.This aspect I have classified as the aspect of the turning point of the world,and this has caused such upheavals throughout the whole Earth in the last fewyears that the world has been like a boiling kettle with events chasing andovertaking each other. Yet today we feel the aftereffects of this significantaspect. The human being is hardly able to catch his breath as he staggers fromevent to event, carried away and held in the grasp of the weight of theexperiences.…Pluto is giving the Earth a new face and calls forth deep cutting changes,especially in culture. He helps the human being in his struggle with thefettered energies and discloses new, heretofore unknown, forces of nature. Theutilization of the heat of the Sun, of the slumbering force in the unsmashedatom, of the enormous reserves of earth-heat inside the earth, of the giganticenergies which express themselves in the movement of the waters of the sea (ebband flow of the tides), to make use of the volcanic forces of the earth, theexperiments with transmutation of force, and also all more or less giganticdaring and revolutionary projects of our time, can all be classified as theoutpouring power of Pluto.…"},{"pageContent":"7....THE PLUTO/PERSEPHONE MYTHEvoking the ArchetypesGARY ROSENTHALThe myth of Pluto and Persephone begins on an ordinary day, in a flowery field.A field where Persephone is picking flowers with a retinue of other virginalgoddesses. What could be more pastoral and innocent?One of the flowers seems especially luminous and alluring to Persephone (as ithad been placed there by Gaia, an even older Earth Mother than Persephone’s ownmother, Demeter). And in picking this flower “arranged” for her—a hundred-headednarcissus—a chasm opens beneath her from the flower she’s just unearthed. And inthe next instant, she herself is plucked—raped, and carried down into theunderworld by an invisible god—He of Many Names: Pluto, the Greek god of death.…Though there’s no one “right” way to read any myth, I find the evocativemetaphors at the myth’s beginning to include: Persephone’s naïve lack ofawareness of the depths lying beneath her, and what these depths contain.Secondly, the shocking loss of that innocence (and the suggestion that there isa primordial intelligence in cahoots with Pluto—Gaia—that doesn’t want her—andby extension, us—to remain so innocently naïve toward what is invisible anddeep). And lastly, that Persephone enters her underworld marriage to Pluto as aninvoluntary descent, much as our own deepening may be initiated by traumaticevents that involuntarily arise, grab us, and pull us down—or these days, bringus to therapy.In retrospect, such traumatic events may later come to be viewed as “benevolentseductions”—into depth itself. This may explain why Pluto was sometimes depictedas having two pairs of arms—one pair that seemed threatening, and the other in agesture that seems welcoming to us. But from Persephone’s more naïve (kore,maiden, preinitiated) view, she isn’t courted by her husband to be; she’sambushed, raped, abducted. And as the poet Robert Creeley once heard her say, “Olove, where are you leading me now?”Yet a virtue of such “involuntary descents” is that they can lead us to a depthwe might not have reached in any other way. Suddenly, we discover we’re not inKansas anymore, not on the flat surface of the Great Plains—nor the flattenedplane of life’s mundane dailyness, where we often get to pick and choose, andwithout such deep, immediate, and unsuspected complications from what we pick.Instead, something immanently shocking, overwhelming, is taking place, likegetting a cancer diagnosis or being pulled down by a shark. We’ve been singledout, as if stalked by something that seems to have its own designs, its owndesire for us. Something more powerful than ourselves seems to have us in itsgrasp. Perhaps we’re finally close enough to an agency of Pluto that he can nowconfer his riches, the depth of perspective he would bring us to—albeit kickingand screaming.I’m suggesting that whenever our traumas, terrors, and vulnerabilityinvoluntarily appear and seem too “overwhelming,” we may have become Persephone,may be about to lose some portion of our naiveté, may be in the grips of someform of mythic initiation. And Plutonic initiation—Pluto’s style of eros—is notonly “overwhelming,” or leading us to feel “carried away,” but involves beingpricked, probed, penetrated by what has been hidden or feared. (Maybe thisarchetype thus lies behind the contemporary, anecdotal reports of people beingabducted—and probed—by aliens.)The name Pluto comes from Ploutos, which means “riches.” And we seem to inheritthese riches not by anything that is given or added to us, but by what isrevealed from what he takes away (whatever we have held most dearly, whatever wethought we couldn’t bear to live without). And finally he takes everything away.And in this way Pluto is not only the god of death, and the “deepest” god of theGreek pantheon, but the god of deepest wisdom. For as the god of death andimpermanence, his deconstructive power is such that he can also destroy thecognitive and emotional obscurations that veil the deepest truth. (Of the god’smany names, in India he was called Shiva). And without metaphorically dying towho we have naively been taking ourselves to be, there is no “second birth,” no“resurrection” into a more essential form; the butterfly of the soul remainsencased in some form of larval shell.1Destabilizing visitations from below, that the ego may normally defend against,at other times are quite overwhelming. Consensual reality becomes a helplessspectator. We are dragged down into the underworldly spaces, the psychic holesof our deepest wounds and helplessness where we feel the most deficient, like avulnerable maiden being ravished. There’s often an edge of terror. Plutonicinitiations up the ante, like enriched Plutonium. They’re powerful, powerfullydeconstructive (corrosive to the ego; and so the ego feels them as destructive).We have been grabbed by something that could destroy what we’ve known asourselves, and all our best laid plans …For these terrifying reasons, in the ancient world Pluto was usually not spokenof directly but instead referred to by euphemisms, as if even speaking his namemight attract the god’s attention, might lead the god of death to come for us.One of the commonly used euphemisms for Pluto was, in fact, “He Who Comes For UsAll.” Yet another was, “The Good Counselor” (a nuance reflected not only byGreek mythology, but also in Toltec shamanism when Don Juan Matus tells CarlosCastaneda to always keep Death as a counselor over his left shoulder). IfOedipus wasn’t as universal as Freud had thought, Death shows up everywhere,comes for us all.But as the Greeks seemed to know, Pluto is also the deepest of counselors—a verydemanding one, though: a real hard ass who won’t let us get away with anythingbut the deepest truth—which is all that might remain, once our deconstructiveinitiation has gone deep, once Pluto has fully had his way with us.And when Pluto is “doing therapy” with us, it’s like he first drags us into theneighborhood we were the most frightened to enter, and then if we’re lucky, orhave the wherewithal to make use of the teaching he’s offering, we might comeout of that neighborhood transformed, no longer so afraid of the thing that usedto scare us. He is a “good counselor” in that he first shows us what is not anadequate enough refuge, what is not a large enough peg for us to hang our hat.The world, it turns out, is deeper than we thought. And as Persephonediscovered, maybe we are too.It’s like our brush with Death, our death or near-death experiences, theencounter with our deepest fears—our “abduction into ultimate depth”—can show uswhat’s really important in life, what’s most deeply true, what can be reliedupon, and what not. A great light might appear. Goethe’s last words: “merelicht, mere licht!” (“more light, more light!”). On our deathbeds, a deeperwisdom may beckon—as our vanities flee, like rats leaving a sinking ship.Psychotherapy itself may be Plutonic, and like gambling or prostitution, an“underworld activity.” Or I find something depth-conferring, unpoliced, andenlivened in conceiving of it in this way. And in fact, the night before C. G.Jung hung out his shingle to practice psychotherapy, he had a dream that he wasopening the largest brothel in the world.In important ways, Pluto and Persephone inform the imaginal backdrop for depthpsychology. If the more unsavory manifestation of Pluto is an “underworldfigure” (like a mafia don, a predatory psychopath, or a lurking pedophile orrapist), then the more noble side of the archetype is the psychopomp, a receiveror guider of souls—those more welcoming arms. But the god of the underworld ismore an impersonal receiver of souls, though, harvesting a new generation ofhuman beings every twelve to thirty years, which astronomically is the time ittakes Pluto’s irregular orbits to complete—and in astrology this is sometimesthus thought to be what determines “a generation.” This isn’t a warm and fuzzydeity—whereas the compassion of his wife Persephone attends more to human sideof death’s bewilderment and grief.Though both the most and least successful of therapies inevitably end, thesoul’s deepening seems a continual or cyclic dying—to whatever we have lasttaken ourselves to be; and thus has no conclusive ending. And the same might besaid of the relationship between Pluto and Persephone, which enduresforever—through Persephone’s eternal and bi-polar swings, her yearly cycling upand down, her transits between earth and the underworld. The relationshipbetween them endures—even given its rude beginning—that matter of the rape.(Though when gods have sex we may need to read between the lines, or note thespecific nuance of their style of loving, each of them different in importantways.)The Plutonic psychopomp as therapist, though, is but one half of a couple whomeet behind closed doors, hidden from view, like in an underworldly vault—or anillicit tryst that is nobody else’s business. What they say and do there is“confidential,” privileged information. Like what happens in Vegas stays inVegas.But even if one member of the couple at times is the psychopomp, still it takestwo to tango, and in any moment the music could change, and suddenly the otherpartner begins to lead, to take them deeper. These confidential visitations,these cyclic encounters with each other, may lead them each to a dissolutioninto the same depth, and by doing so, can confer the sovereignty of that depth.For what is pricked, probed, and uncovered may become an initiation intofearlessness, a fearlessness toward the depths of feeling, the depths of grief,and depths of the psyche that are even deeper than death.In cultures not mythically dissociated, important myths have commonly beenenacted as initiatory rites—so that their metaphoric themes don’t become enacted(neurotically) as symptoms. And as a psychotherapist working in a mythicallydissociated, narcissistic culture, I’ve attempted to offer at least some initialapproximate of this.Amongst the most profoundly transformational of such rites were those celebratedat Eleusis (the Eleusinian Mysteries)—rites which were enacted for nearly twothousand years, and which were based on the myth involving Persephone’sabduction. Unfortunately, a more nuanced understanding of the rites thatcomprised the Eleusinian Mysteries have largely remained an object ofconjecture—because revealing the details of these rites was punishable by death.And in this way, these Mysteries have largely remained a mystery.For two thousand years though, we have retained a similar rite celebrating amythic death and reappearance—the Catholic mass.2 But a problem with ritual—aproblem encountered in any religion, or with any spiritual practice, really—isthat the ego can get a hold of almost anything, such that things can becomeroutinized, wrongly-vantaged, distorted, and thus no longer as able to effect aprofound shift in awareness.In this light, it’s hard to know what kept the mysteries of Eleusis so vital andpsychically charged for such a long time. Undoubtedly, the injunction againstrevealing the details of these rites must certainly have helped to preservetheir numinosity—but can’t in itself fully account for the profound impact ofthese rites. Recent scholarship, however, has plausibly suggested that this mayhave been aided by the ingestion of psycho-active ergot, a fungoid growth foundon grains—the study of which later led the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman to firstsynthesize the hallucinogen LSD.3What scholars have more commonly agreed upon is that the Eleusinian rites seemedto greatly relieve their celebrants’ fear of death, as if providing aperspective—or the pointing out—of what might be embraced or accessed in moments(such as death) when all else is being taken away. In our own culture, the lossof such a rite, or the failure to create one, has left us with a fearful lack oforientation in facing death, a lack of orientation toward what dies and whatdoesn’t—a lack of orientation toward what we most deeply are, and are not.The encounter with death/Pluto can be frightening, and in different ways fordifferent people—for in a mythically dissociated culture, a culture that has norites that might better prepare us for death, death can be the ultimate boogieman. But Persephone’s abduction by the god of death is also an initiation intomystery, one in which she is penetrated by—and taken to—a greater depth. (Likethe old Chinese Zen masters such as Han Shan, who take on the name of themountain where they live, Hades—as Pluto was also known—names both an invisiblegod and the realm where he dwells.)Persephone’s descent into Hades is at once the loss of her familiar vantage, herfamiliar world and the loss of her accustomed identity. For she must suffer theseparation from her mother Demeter, and the loss of her virginal, maidenperspective (which had been naively unaware of the depths lying within andbeneath her) in order for her to inherit her own sovereignty, and to reign as aco-monarch of depth—no longer as a vulnerable victim with no agency, but as theQueen of the underworld.And as such, in her matured version, hers is the mythological perspectivecapable of compassionately welcoming others, who in facing death are alsoinvoluntarily entering the mysterious realm where she’s come to reign. In ourmodern world, hospice workers may be the embodiment of this aspect ofPersephone—just as anyone who has been raped, molested, abducted, or hasexperienced an involuntary, terrifying descent into a greater depth may haveembodied Persephone in her earlier, kore form.As a culture, we’ve been lacking something like this: mythic rites that can leadto a shift of vantage. And a transformation of whom—or what—we have takenourselves to be. For when a culture lacks such rites and teachings, people aremore likely to remain in the collectively-shared condition of “taking themselvesto be what they are not.” In this way, there is not only a lack of orientationin facing death, and a lack of awareness of what doesn’t die, but (from aPlutonic perspective) a collective case of “mistaken identity.”Our culture itself now largely abides in this mistaken, un-initiated condition:a condition where the self-image is what people embellish, attempt to market,and naively take themselves to be. In the process we become dissociated from thedepths of being itself. With this loss of depth—this absence of Plutonicvision—“the butterfly of the soul” remains encased by something akin to a larvalshell. And the best term for this uninitiated, en-shelled condition isnarcissism.And so, perhaps it’s no accident that the myth of Narcissus ends with adepth-vision, a vision that leads to his metaphoric death, and to an equallymetaphoric flowering. For in dying beside a lucidly-clear reflective pool intowhich he had been gazing, Narcissus then morphs into a narcissus flower, aperennial that returns each year as the harbinger of spring. While the myth ofPluto and Persephone (which also reflects a cyclical process of death andrebirth) begins—as did this writing—with Persephone picking a version of thisvery flower.Notes1. For a fuller exploration of the linked myths of Pluto/Persephone andNarcissus/Echo, see my forthcoming The Death of Narcissus: and Other Heresiesfor an Age of Narcissism.2. It was due to the rise of Christianity, in fact, that the Eleusinianmysteries were closed down in 392 C.E by the Christian Emperor Theodosius I, whosaw these rites as inspiring resistance to Christianity. Within four years thetemple of Demeter and every sacred site in Eleusis had been sacked, leavingbehind only ruins and rubble, where for nearly two thousand yearstransformational rites had been celebrated.3.

In the fall of that year I entered thirdgrade. Soon afterward two friends and I inaugurated a space program alongsidethat of NASA, which had been established a year earlier. Intending to send atwelve-foot rocket to Venus, we sent a letter to the new space agency andreceived helpful photographs of existing rockets and missiles: Atlas, Thor,Juno, and Titan. Since our space program was also a secret society, I declaredthat, as an initiation, the members be able quickly to recite the names of thenine planets in reverse order:Pluto-Neptune-Uranus-Saturn-Jupiter-Mars-Earth-Venus-Mercury. Why did I putPluto first, the farthest, coldest, smallest, most mysterious orb of the solarsystem, the one with the longest and strangest orbit? Maybe in a cold climate Iwas seeking a trajectory from the wintry dark toward solar sustenance. Somethingcharmed and called to us from that black distance, “the nearest faraway place”(the title of a 1969 Beach Boys instrumental). The fact that Pluto moved closerto the Sun than Neptune for part of its orbit was important: obviously it wastrying to say something to us. Twenty-nine years previously (a preposterouslyshort span, it seems now, looking back), Pluto had been identified and named. Bythe time we started our space program the Russians had already launched thefirst satellite, put the first living creature in orbit, detected radiation fromthe Van Allen belts, reached escape velocity from the Earth and initiatedtranslunar injection, orbited the Sun, crashed a ship into the moon, and sentback the first photos of the lunar far side. These to us highly admirableaccomplishments radically undermined the Manichean Cold War ruses of the day.One night that year or the next I had a dream of Pluto, more indelible thanpowerful, in that it was accompanied by no great emotion, but my memory of ittoday remains as clear as it was fifty years ago. I was naked and alone on asmall frozen planet, a featureless light-gray ice field like a scuffed-upskating rink, extending as far as I could see in all directions. Sparse winterscrub and bare trees occasionally interrupted the mostly barren ice plain. Theplanetscape was moderately bright, like a lightly overcast winter noon, the skyalmost indistinguishable from the surface. It was cold but not too cold; Iwasn’t shivering, there was no wind. I wasn’t lonely. The main attraction ofthis personal Pluto was that I could urinate and defecate anywhere, just likethe few shaggy wolf like creatures errant on their own business on the tracklessice all around me. Over the years I’ve been completely uninterested in (notresistant to) interpretations of this dream, which feels less like a text thanlike primal cosmological data.Since Pluto’s anomalous and highly elliptical orbit is inclined to the eclipticby 17 degrees, it seems misleading to say that it “crosses” that of Neptune, butits trajectory takes it closer to the Sun for twenty years of its 248-yearorbital period. From January 21, 1979, to February 11, 1999, it was the eighthplanet out; had our space program survived we’d have altered our initiationrite. Some snapshots taken by Pluto during 1990, the year when it came closer toEarth than it will be for another full orbit: the first McDonald’s restaurantsare opened in Russia and China; the Communist Party of the Soviet Union votes toend its power monopoly; the largest art theft in U.S. history takes place at theIsabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston; a decade after completing its missionby exploring the Saturnian system, Voyager 1 takes the famous “Pale Blue Dot”photo of Earth from 3.5 billion miles away; the Hubble Space Telescope islaunched; the World Health Organization removes homosexuality from its masterlist of diseases; East and West Germany unite; Iraq invades and annexes Kuwait,leading to the First Gulf War; the Channel Tunnel between England and Franceopens; and the first web page is created.Also in 1959, the Egyptologist and alchemist R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, inconversation with his then student André Vandenbroeck, conveyed a traditionalistview of the solar system in the cosmic hierarchy: “We cannot deny the existenceof horizons whenever distance reaches its limit. That goes for the horizon ofreason as well as for the natural phenomenon … The solar system is man’shorizon. That does not mean that there is nothing beyond. Simply that what isbeyond is not of his nature, not on the scale of his vision. Teleologically, thesun is the end of man. It is folly to think beyond. It will lead to nothing, andit might destroy what is.”The Christian esotericist Rudolf Steiner elaborated this traditionalist visionin several lectures given from 1907 to 1922: “The ancients rightly consideredSaturn the most distant planet … Our present Saturn received its name in ancienttimes when the wise ones could still give meaningful names to things. It wasgiven its name out of its very nature. Today, this is no longer done. From thestandpoint of materialistic astronomy it is quite justified to add Uranus andNeptune; but they are only members of the solar system in an astronomical sense.They have a different origin, they are foreign bodies that have become attractedand attached to our system. They are invited guests, and we are right to omitthem. There were beings at the very beginning of our Earth who were scarcelyfitted to take part in further development, who were still so young in theirwhole evolution that any further step would have destroyed them. They had toreceive a sphere of action, so to speak, on which they could preserve theircomplete youthfulness. As Jupiter contracted, the beings who withdrew pressedtogether something that has nothing to do with our evolution; it was essentiallyrelated to the withdrawing beings. Thus, first Uranus was formed and later,during Mars evolution, Neptune arose. The names Uranus and Neptune were notappropriately chosen as had formerly been the case, though some meaning remainsin the name Uranus. It was given at a time when an inkling of giving the rightname still survived.”Steiner died in 1925 and offered no comments about soon-to-be-discovered Pluto.Uranus, as it happens, lies at the edge of naked-eye visibility, though it wasnot recognized as a planet in that fashion. It was first noted by WilliamHerschel on March 13, 1781, during a telescopic sky search, and when four nightslater he saw that the object had moved, he determined that it was a comet. Theidea of adding a new planet to the five of unrecorded antiquity was not anobvious one, and even though its orbit was soon seen to be noncometary, it wassix months before its planetary status was generally accepted. Among the namesoriginally proposed: Georgum Sidus (the Georgian star, after King George III),Herschel’s Planet, Hypercronius, Cybele, Astraea, and Minerva.Unexpected movement in the orbit of Uranus gave rise, through calculation, tothe discovery of Neptune. After a few decades of refined observations it becameclear that neither Uranus nor Neptune moved in they way that they should, soanother unknown object was postulated, eventually leading to the discovery ofPluto, though subsequently it was determined that Pluto was too small to havehad the requisite effects on Neptune and Uranus.In 1923 the journalist, playwright, and political operative Dietrich Eckhartrecorded the following comment by Adolf Hitler, to whom he was a mentor: “Yes!”[Hitler] cried. “We’ve been on the wrong track! Consider how an astronomer wouldhandle a similar situation. Suppose that he has been carefully observing themotion of a certain group of celestial bodies over a long period of time.Examining his records, he suddenly notices something amiss: ‘Damn it!’ he says.‘Something’s wrong here. Normally, these bodies would have to be situateddifferently relative to one another; not this way. So there must be a hiddenforce somewhere which is responsible for the deviation.’ And, using hisobservations, he performs lengthy calculations and accurately computes thelocation of a planet that no eye has yet seen, but which is there all the same,as he has just proved. But what does the historian do, on the other hand? Heexplains an anomaly of the same type solely in terms of the conspicuousstatesmen of the time. It never occurs to him that there might have been ahidden force that caused a certain turn of events. But it was there,nevertheless; it has been there since the beginning of history. You know whatthat force is: the Jew.”In 2006, seven years after Pluto resumed its role as the most distant planet,the International Astronomical Union held its annual meeting in Prague and tookup the brewing question of its status as a celestial object. The Kuiper Belt,extending outward from the orbit of Neptune, was now understood to be populatedby many smaller icy bodies, thought to be remnants of planetary formation, andPluto was more like these, it was proposed, than it was like the other planets.In Resolution 5A a “planet” was defined as a celestial body that (a) is in orbitaround the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigidbody forces, so that it maintains hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly roundshape), and (c) has “cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.” A “dwarfplanet” shared characteristics (a) and (b), but its self-gravity has not clearedthe neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) it is not a satellite. On thisresolution the votes were not counted, but it passed with “a great majority.”Resolution 6A, “Pluto is a dwarf planet by the above definition and isrecognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects,” waspassed with 237 votes in favor, 157 against, and seventeen abstentions, which isless than two-thirds of the voters approving of the official reclassification.Alan Stern, head of the New Horizons mission, has called the definition“absurd,” and lamented that “less that 5 percent of the world’s astronomersvoted.” Though it refers to gravitational effects, the phrase “cleared theneighborhood” sounds, in human terms, like some kind of bullying, segregation,urban renewal, or police-state tactics, and Owen Gingerich, astronomer emeritusat Harvard, is among many scientists displeased with the fuzziness of thelanguage and the concept. He also regarded saying that a “dwarf planet” was nota “planet” as “a curious linguistic contradiction.” A significant number ofastronomers continue to think that Pluto and similar small objects should beclassified as planets, because they have, in many cases, cores, geology,seasons, moons, atmospheres, clouds, and polar caps.Pluto hasn’t changed, of course; we have. That the construction of ourclassification systems reveals as much about our thinking as it does about theobjects of our thought was colorfully underlined by Michel Foucault when, in hisfamous preface to The Order of Things, he cited a (fictional) Chineseencyclopedia alluded to by Borges, which divided animals into fourteencategories, such as “those that belong to the emperor,” “embalmed ones,” “thosedrawn with a very fine camel hair brush,” “et cetera,” and “those that, at adistance, resemble flies.” What we “decide” Pluto “is” will have an effect onwhat we know about it. Voting, whether representative or not, will only take usso far, yet how else? That is, at root, the epistemological dilemma of our age.We presume, by and large, that things have the right names. On March 14, 1930,Venetia Burney, an eleven-year-old Oxford schoolgirl, suggested the name Plutofor the newly discovered planet. “I was quite interested in Greek and Romanmyths and legends at the time,” she later said, also recalling how she and herschoolmates placed lumps of clay in the park, proportionately sized anddistributed, to represent the solar system. That morning she was at breakfastwith her grandfather Falconer Madan, who saw a newspaper article about thediscovery and remarked that the planet had not yet been named. Burney suggestedPluto. Mr. Madan told an astronomer friend of his at the University of Oxford,who thought it an excellent choice and telegrammed the Lowell Observatory inFlagstaff, Arizona, where the discovery had been made. (Based on an episode inthe Iliad, Venetia’s great uncle Henry Madan had suggested the names Phobos andDeimos for the moons of Mars.) Burney heard nothing more on the matter for morethan a month. On May 1, 1930, the name Pluto was unanimously adopted. (That thefirst two letters were the initials of Percival Lowell, the astronomer who hadpredicted the existence of a trans-Neptunian planet but had not lived to see itsdiscovery, was thought to be a factor.) When the news went public, Mr. Madanrewarded his granddaughter with a five-pound note. “This was unheard of then. Asa grandfather, he liked to have an excuse for generosity,” Venetia recalled.Percival Lowell’s widow, thinking that the old gods were “worn out,” wanted tocall it Planet X: “I do not like Pluto for the name.”Pluto’s oldest name was Hades, thought to come from aeides, the unseen, or fromeidenai, signifying knowledge. Feared by gods and men who refuse to utter hisname, he is also known by epithets: presider over meetings, fetcher of men,receiver of many, giver of good counsel. He is the son of Cronus and Rhea,brother of Zeus and Poseidon. Having deposed Cronus, the three brothers castlots for the kingdoms of the heaven, the sea, and the infernal regions. The lastwent to Hades, where he rules with his abducted wife, Persephone, over the otherpowers below and over the dead. He is stern and pitiless, deaf to prayer orflattery, and sacrifice to him is of no avail. Only the music of Orpheus haspower over him. This was revealed when Orpheus charmed Hades into returning hiswife, Eurydice, from the underworld. Hades has a helmet, given him by theCyclopes, that makes him invisible. Because of his generosity toward Eurydiceand his love of Persephone, the idea of his character underwent a radical changearound the fifth century BC, under the influence of the Eleusinian mysteries.Instead of the life-hating god of death, he was now seen as beneficent, thebestower of things that grow from the earth, metals, minerals, and otherblessings produced below ground. In this aspect he was called Pluto, fromplouton, giver of wealth, and at most of the centers of his cult he is soworshipped.The initial 1942 report on the discovery of the element plutonium was keptsecret until after World War II; it was finally published in the Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society in 1948, which is where the names plutonium andneptunium were both revealed. In his autobiography, Glenn T. Seaborg tells moreabout the naming of plutonium: “It was so difficult to make, from such rarematerials, that we thought it would be the heaviest element ever formed. So weconsidered names like extremium and ultimium. Fortunately, we were spared theinevitable embarrassment that one courts when proclaiming a discovery to be theultimate in any field by deciding to follow the nomenclatural precedents of thetwo prior elements. A new planet had been discovered in 1781 and, like the restof the planets, named for a Greek or Roman deity—Uranus. A scientist whodiscovered a heavy new element [number 92] eight years later named it after theplanet: uranium. The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846, so Ed McMillanfollowed this precedent and named element 93 neptunium. Conveniently for us, thefinal planet, Pluto, had been discovered in 1930. We briefly considered the formplutium, but plutonium [94] seemed more euphonious. Each element has a one- ortwo-letter abbreviation. Following the standard rules, this symbol should be Pl,but we chose Pu instead. We thought our little joke might come under criticism,but it was hardly noticed.”Precovery: before Pluto was identified by Clyde Tombaugh, just turnedtwenty-four, at the Lowell Observatory, in Flagstaff, Arizona, astronomers atother observatories unknowingly had taken sixteen previous photographs of it.The oldest was made at the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909."},{"pageContent":"9....THE INQUISITION OF PLUTOA Planetary Meta-Drama in One ActJOHN D.

It is constructed in theshape of a rhombic golden hexahedron or the equivalent. A perfectly round tableis placed square in the center of the room surrounded by asymmetrical ellipticalstools.The Chorus sits at the left side of the room in a semicircle. A small ReviewBoard composed of men and women in business attire sits at the right, also in asemicircle. The Board can be heard mumbling or grumbling in low voicesthroughout the proceedings.There is a delegation of the major planets and one seemingly minor but powerfulplanetoid. And others, important members of the Hearing, are seated at thetable.Uranus and Neptune are sitting together on cushions in a corner. They can beheard conversing/whispering throughout the proceedings. Neptune occasionallyquietly plays the harmonium.A large picture window in the shape of a trapezoid and framed with wood moldingcan be seen in the back of the room. It shows a deep space view of the solarsystem with the Sun and orbiting planets surrounded by a spherical haze. This isreferred to as the “Big Picture.” There are small sigils or glyphs representingtraditional symbols of the planets hanging on the walls as well as severalantique carvings.The Chair of the Review Board steps forward and introduces himself.Chair: Thank you all for coming, and to your prompt response to this request fora Hearing. I would like to introduce … (individually introduces theCast … Prosecutor, Defense Lawyer, Planets, etc.)Pro: Ladies and Gentlemen: We are all assembled here today to consider the caseof his Grace, lord Pluto. Our mission here is to uncover his purpose, hismotives, his physical character, the Whole Story of his place in this stellarsystem of our Galaxy, known as the solar system.Def: He is only a planet or maybe a planetoid. Actually, a dwarf planet.Pro: And with a name like his I would suggest much more. (A beat.) Your Grace,we will now proceed to probe into your shadowy realm. A descent into your realmof darkness … Do you hereby swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but thetruth? No half truths or quarter truths. We measure truth here v-e-r-ycarefully. Scientific. (chuckles) So help you God.Lord Pluto: God is Dead!Pro: Oh … No, No, No … I can see we are not getting off to a good start here.What will the authorities think?Lord Pluto: Of what Authority do you speak?Pro: Is it your assertion then, your Grace, that the great God of ourforefathers, who the monkey man on planet Earth has worshipped for hundreds ofyears, is gone? Out of existence. Hiding, cowering in some shadowy cave in yourdark realm. Some kind of ideological asylum. That now you, master of the soulsof the departed, have captured the soul of God. And all the other ancient godsand goddesses?Lord Pluto: All gone.Pro: Does that mean Brahma, Yahweh and Jesus, Lucifer, and the Hindu monkey godLord Hanuman, even the self-created Prajapati, are all gone too? And all thepeaceful deities, and all the wrathful deities as well?… And then, what ofyonder Sol? The great god of Life and Light, the very Center of the solarsystem? Points to the Big Picture.Lord Pluto: Merely a blast furnace of hydrogen and helium. Nothing more!Pro: So that now you are in total control. The last one standing? What hubris, Isay. A massive power grab!Uranus: Yes, I recall being overthrown. And here I am. Gone but not forgotten.Lord Saturn: Ha, Ha, Ha …Uranus: I can see it posted all over Pluto’s realm: God(s) Wanted Dead or Alive.Catch ’em if you can.Neptune: If the God(s) didn’t exist someone would have to invent them.Lord Pluto: Well spoken Neptune, great Master of illusion.Lord Saturn: Look out! I can see his Grace is playing hardball now.Chorus: (chants) Invention and Deception… at your DiscretionThe gods live; the gods dieCan’t live with ’em.Can’t live without ’em.Pro: And furthermore I question what historic era you really think you residein. The Ancient or the Modern?Lord Pluto: Actually, I preferred the ancient Greek World, or even theRenaissance. Especially the late Renaissance. Those great historic periods.Pro: Yes, indeed, your Grace, you and the Jesuits, I believe. Well, you werewhistling a different tune then. God-fearing defenders of “humanity.” The famousor infamous Spanish Inquisition of late Renaissance Europe, when all manner ofwitches, heretics, and unbelievers were hunted down, interrogated, and thendealt with (pause) severely. You even look the part. Had some fun, eh! Now thetables are turned. Time for you to face the probe and the scabbard. Now’s thetime for your Inquisition!Lord Pluto: There was more respect in those days for position and rank!Pro: A little more respect for you, for all the gods, even I dare say for thatgreat God of Everything that you now say has been banished? Are you tobe-be-lieved! You are out of your … century! Past your prime.Def: His views agree with many modernist Earthlings of the twentieth century.Lord Pluto: I could quote for instance: Mench-kin H. L., who says …Pro: (interrupts) That’s pronounced “Mencken H. L.” I believe.Lord Pluto: In his “Memorial Service” he states that all the ancient gods, thegods of civilized peoples, once “theoretically omnipotent and omniscient andimmortal, and all are dead.” And goes on to say that given the blood andsacrifices offered them, that it is, no doubt, a good thing!Lord Jupiter: A true Humanist!Pro: A true “Memorial Service”! Someone who puts the human monkey man first andeverything else last! And what of your Grace? Is it your business to scurry awayall these fallen icons?Lord Saturn: New and worthier deities demanding a greater and larger sacrificeof blood and treasure have taken their place. But that is not his Grace’sresponsibility.Pro: Yes, indeed, was it not at the time of the very discovery of this far-flungplanetoid, in the early twentieth century that the monkey man unleashed greaterdeath and destruction than ever occurred on the planet. You might say theEarthling devolved to his worst chimpanzee behavior! A Final Solution alright!What does your Grace say to these charges?Lord Pluto: I was always there. For billions of years. The monkey man did notyet acknowledge my presence.Lord Saturn: Is that so?Pro: And when he did acknowledge you, all Hell, excuse me, all Hades brokeloose. If the gods be dead as you claim, then, by Symmetry, I declare the god ofthe dead is dead.Def: Objection. Symmetry is not an admissible argument. It cannot be used here.Someone broke into Symmetry. Symmetry is broke! He’s down on his luck. Damaged.Not reliable and even unstable. A nice idea, but …Pro: Then partial or bi-lateral Symmetry? How about Dynamic Symmetry?Def: No quibbling. It’s off the table.Pro: That so, well then perhaps death lies dying. Is that better, or worse?Lord Saturn: Hey, what a concept! The very inverse of mortality!Def: We also agreed that there would be no talk of mirror images, inversions, orany form of symmetry, and especially … any reference to immortality.Lord Saturn: But how can it be avoided?Chorus: It is Agreed, It is Agreed,It is Decreed, It is De-Creed … Indeed.Pro: His Excellency the Representative from Sirius would like to speak.Sirius: Yes, I say this has all gone too far!A loud uproar among the delegates.Def: Please Gentlemen … You will have your turn to speak, your Excellency.Pro: Again, I propose that you are out of touch. Out of your … century!Lord Pluto: Oh?Pro: Yes, it appears the monkey man has opened a new paradigm, entered a newhistorical era. A different Worldview for the twenty-first century. It is called“post modern.”Lord Pluto: Did you say “post mor-dem”?Pro: P-o-s-t m-o-d-e-r-n. Anything goes, sort of. No more dull drab modernism.No more nihilism. No more iconoclasm. The smashings over. Just like you, yourGrace, boring Monolithic Modernism is finished. Tired of plain or plane. Let’s“take a fancy.” Get dimensional … Too logical, too rational.Lord Saturn: The logical positivists. The modern philosophical movement.Pro: Exactly, way over the top.Lord Jupiter: (Stands up, spreads out his arms and breaks into song.)Ya gotta have h’art, miles and miles and miles of h’art.It’s nice to be a genius of course,But don’t put that horse before the cartFirst, ya gotta have h’art.Lord Saturn: Where did that come from?Lord Jupiter: Damn Yankees. A 1950s Broadway musical.Uranus: (to Neptune) I remember that one with the sexy dame that played thelead.Neptune: (looks away disdainfully) Clearly before my time.Uranus: No way!Pro: Please … I appreciate the enthusiasm, but no more spontaneous outbursts! AsI was saying … Subjective and Objective, all rolled up together. Paleolithic,ancient Roman, medieval Europe, Hindu and Buddhist, all in the same basket. Butno Aquarian or contemporary mish-mash, mind you. It needs to hang together. Dosomething. Say something. Tell a story. Preach a riveting truth. The gods liveand the gods die. It’s an everything stew. Just keep stirring the pot.Chorus: A witches brew and stewA witches stew and brewA goblin’s gooA magician’s pot and cauldron… A magician’s spot of … Whee-ew! (The Chorus twist and turn while obviously holding their noses.)Lord Saturn: How enlightened!Lord Pluto: Bunk!… Now all the great philosophers are “hanging together”, and“telling stories.” The monkey man is forever revising his paradigms! And anyway,what’s that got to do with me!Lord Saturn: Just the facts, please.Lord Jupiter: Now I can go for that. Your facts, or my facts!Pro: I was simply trying to ex …Def: (interrupts) Objection … Gentlemen, this is all very interesting, or notvery interesting at all, (angrily) BUT WE JUST DON’T HAVE TIME FOR IT!! There isan important investigation before us, and we must proceed.Pro: To the point, your Grace, is it true that this current probe sent by themonkey man for your examination is powered by one of the most dangerous anddeadly radioactive elements created by the Earthlings, namely plutonium-238? Thelight and power of yonder Sol (points to the Big Picture) can barely reach yourdark domain, so something else, more sinister has been devised.Lord Pluto: Yes indeed, but of no consequence. And the risk is quite small. Whyit’s hardly a nuclear bomb or even some huge reactor. Laughs convulsively.Pro: Indeed, the risk is always small until something happens!Lord Saturn: I barely escaped a few years ago during the Cassini probe.Lord Jupiter: And me too.Uranus: I have been spoken and accounted for. I’ve been named. I’m in myelement. Uranium.Neptune: And so am I. Neptunium. (She rolls her head and eyes.)Pro: And does your Grace not have some kinship with this very plutonium?Lord Pluto: They just borrowed my name.Chorus: What’s in a NameBeen said before… said beforeThe International Astronomical Union KnowsThe Naming Committee of the Astronomical Union Surely Knows.…Lord Jupiter: There’s more to a name, I would say.Lord Saturn: Less, I would say.Pro: And who your Grace, who on Earth, christened—forgive me—gave you yourEpithet?Lord Pluto: My Epitaph? The Earthling Disney, I suppose. No … it was a younglady admirer.Pro: Is that so?Lord Pluto: I have my charms.Pro: Charms and Talismans, no doubt, to fool the foolish!Chorus: No … No, No. It was the Fates.The Fates are in the NameThe Names are in the Fates. Indeed.It is Decreed, Agreed.It is De-Creed. In Deed.Pro: And in addition, there is the question of your orbit, your Grace?Lord Pluto: And what of my orbit?Pro: It’s a bit irregular. More eccentric than that of Uranus! It resides in anentirely different plane from those other planets surrounding yonder Sol.Furthermore, you have flagrantly disturbed your neighbors Neptune and Uranus.Chorus: (chants) More than Elliptical.Elliptical and Eccentric.Not one of us. Never was. Never was.Eccentric. Not normal. Never was.Banished … BanishedTo the End, to the very EdgeOut to the very EdgeThe Edge of the End!Def: No more than the others here, he obeys gravity’s Universal law of inversesquare attraction while scribing his orbit ’round yonder Sol.Lord Pluto: (interrupts) In fact, should there have been the rule of inversecube, as one might expect in some multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean universe,I would have long since jumped out into the Beyond in some logarithmic spiral.Pro: Instead of wriggling about in some eccentric orbit around yonder Sol.Chorus: An Alien Intruder … an Alien IntruderCaptured from the Beyond … the Beyond … the BeyondThe Unknown … the UnknownA Prisoner in Sol’s World.Def: Free Pluto, free Pluto from his Solar shackles, from his grim and ancientduties; from his co-dependence on the mad monkey man. Into the Dark Void andUnknown! Let him go.Chorus: Free Pluto, Free Pluto,Let him go, Let him go!Free Persephone, Free the Captive!Let her go, Let her go!Lord Jupiter: (to Lord Saturn) I kind’a like that idea. Year-round harvest.Maybe no winter, too!Lord Saturn: We should have ejected his Grace long ago when we had the chance!Pro: Indeed, send him into deep space—where—he—belongs!… Evidence recentlyacquired shows that once a mighty and dreaded god, once thought a great planeteven, you are really nothing more than a swarm of cosmic debris and paltry ballsof ice! It was thought that your light was just the small reflection of a darkand larger globe. But no, you no longer even have the status of a planet.Dethroned. A mere planetoid. A dwarf. You’re finished. Your reign of terror isover! And there is more to come … (Lord Pluto pulls his hood tight over his head, and blinks spasmodically.)… Indeed, Have we all not been hood-winked by your Grace and your ruthless grabfor power! (LORD PLUTO kicks off his platform shoes unnoticed and shrinks into asmall crouched-over position.)Def: Objection. Lord Pluto remains the tenth most massive planetary system inSolar orbit. (Points to the Big Picture.) And has satellites, followers, I mightadd. Nyx and Styx and Charon and Kerebus.Pro: An unlikely bunch! Some 3-headed jackal, the Night-time and a river offorgetting … of remembering …?Chorus: Nyx and Styx Styx and stones Dogs and drones …Can break my bones …Moans and groans …But Names will never hurt me.… Names will never hurt me.Lord Pluto: You speak of Lethe and Mnemosyne, other unseen and yet to bediscovered rivers in my realm.Pro: And what of Persephone? Where is she? (He looks sternly and accusingly atLORD PLUTO.)Lord Pluto: That’s my business.Pro: And in addition to this obvious “f-o-l-l-o-w-i-n-g” as the Defense wouldcall it, His Grace has covert operatives, too.Lord Pluto: Really!Pro: You need not divulge. We already know. There are many others, be ithundreds just like you. What Earthlings call “plutoids.” Puny paltry plutoids.All lodged in a huge circular ring known as the Kuiper Belt. You see, forcenturies the great Lord Saturn paraded with cloak and hood with scythe in handto scare the living with his spectre! The very the last word on Rings. Untilrecently in the course of history he ruled all boundaries, the very edge of theknown solar system. But no more. Others, too, have Rings. Uranus and Neptune are heard chuckling.Neptune: (spreading out her be-jeweled hands in front of her and speaking loudlyand clearly) And each Ring with a Name: “Courage,” “Liberty,” “Equality,” and“Fraternity.”Lord Pluto: Say What?Lord Saturn: You heard!Pro: But now there is even a larger Ring. A Ring of Closure. The Ring-Pass-Not.The Kuiper Belt, I speak of, and its band of Plutoids.Chorus: (mockingly) Hail Pluto. Bring his Scepter,Bring his Crown,Bring his Ring!…Hail Pluto, King of the Kuiper Belt!Lord Pluto: (Pulls off his hood and cloak, wearing a dark tight fitting garbwith a black skull cap, pointed goatee and long curled and pointedshoes-Renaissance or Elizabethan style dress.) Are you afraid of the Dark, ofthe Depths? Of things that glow in the Dark, of things that go Bump in theNight. Of falling into a Deep Dark Hole and waking in another World? Of buriedtreasure. But instead cling sheepishly to light and clarity, to the Light andBright of yonder Sol. Always ascending, never descending. Always producing;Always reproducing. Go Underneath, Go Undercover. Where the dead are buried.Where ashes fall. A place for forgetting, and for remembering. Where seedsgerminate and where organic meets inorganic. The fertile humus. Of findingFossil’s Fuels, or is it Fool’s Fuel. (Leave it where it lays.) Be still and liefallow. Come Underground to Pluto’s Realm, or come to The Dark Edge at theEnd … Either way … Come, sit in the Shade and enter the Shadow World. Do not beafraid. Let a little Darkness into your life. Empty out into the Deep Dark ofSpace. No, no, bring it to the Light of Day! To Sol’s World. (Looks scornfullyat the Big Picture.) Or keep it in Mine!

Speak now!Sirius: Thank you for inviting me to this Hearing today. As you are aware, we ofthe Stellar System Sirius are approximately eight light-years distance fromyonder Sol’s System. We have examined many exo-planets, many living planetsthroughout the galaxy by our advanced methods of science and technology, ourlong research into the great laws of this universe. We have evolved differentlyfrom those creatures on planet Earth, not unlike the evolution on those islandcontinents on their planet, but more so … Fortunately we have not beenencumbered with the more disturbing, shall I say blood-thirsty characteristicsof the monkey man on planet Earth. The Creator has endowed us with the abilityto advance far into the worlds of mathematics, science, and our specialty:geometry, that wondrous description of the physical universe that we all share.Yes, we may not have some of the more endearing traits of the Earthling, so welldemonstrated here by the charm and jovial personality of lord Jupiter. Sentimentand sentimentality are not our strong points. Maybe that is unfortunate for ourspecies? Nor do we share the ponderous melancholy of lord Saturn or the cold andicy ruthlessness of his Grace. However … We have carefully observed this verdantplanet Earth, one of the few and finest living planets in the Local Region. Forthe past quarter of a century, our planetary system has consistently sentmessages to the fields of Albion in the islands of Britain on yonder Earth,where once primitive Earthlings constructed great geometric structures. Sendingvibrations of light, electromagnetic waves through the void of Minkowski space,nearly a decade in advance, which then interact with local atmosphericconditions on that planet to create geometric patterns of splendor andprecision. Grand and profound symmetries! Some of construction unknown to theancient Greek geometer Euclid, or the contemporary Mandelbrot.Pro: Prove it!Sirius: Is that really necessary. Is it not self evident and well documented!Def: Thought it was the handiwork of some Oxford Don playing with some newtop-secret gadgets.Pro: “GPS” devices on silent motorized trampers.

When Pluto wasfirst discovered in 1930, humankind was already beginning to tinker with theatoms of uranium. That tinkering would, years later, result in the release ofhuge amounts of plutonium into our environment, an element occurring naturallyin the Earth’s crust only in very small amounts: 3.5 tons of it have since beenreleased into the atmosphere by atomic testing. A very small amount of it,one-tenth of a milligram, is said to cause cancer. Pluto’s discovery heraldedthe emergence of the great archetypal power that it symbolically holds into thehands of humans, as well as its great exploitation.As usual for a race so young as ours, we poke, prod, dissect, explode, andmisuse the elements of our environment until we discover (often too late) thatwe must be careful with them, or we could destroy ourselves, and all life onthis planet. We are simple primates who are intensely curious and excited by ournewly discovered toys, but lacking in foresight or objectivity. So now we aresending a probe into the deep reaches of our solar system to find out just whatis going on with Pluto, which seems to be no longer a planet but a cluster ofbodies, like atomic particles in orbit around each other.Astrologically, Pluto is still a planetary body, and quite an important one, asits 248-year cycle around the Sun indicates major changes in different areas ofour collective psyche. The astrological signs that Pluto transits through arerelevant to those changes. In 2015, we are now in Pluto’s transit throughCapricorn, the sign it was in when the United States was just forming theDeclaration that would create its separation from England in 1776. Capricornrules the structures we create to organize our lives, most notably governments.Pluto will return to that same position in 2022, but in 2015 it will form a180-degree opposition to the Sun in the chart of the United States, and square(form a 90-degree angle) the United State’s Saturn. When Pluto makes these kindsof aspects, it is a test of our country’s maturity and a questioning of itsnational identity. Also, wherever Pluto transits, it rules transformation of ourrelationship to power. By the time New Horizons reaches its goal, the UnitedStates will probably be undergoing massive changes, which will affect the restof the world as well.Pluto’s realm is darkness. It is the pit of the bowl of the crucible where thedeep underground fire of transformation takes place. Pluto’s territory isanathema to the sunny warmth of the ego. But it is power. Ultimate power. Thekind of power that easily slips into megalomania if the ego gets hold of it andbegins to identify with it as my power. One of Pluto’s lessons in power is thatit belongs to no one, that the power we hold is shared among all beings, all thecreative forces of the known and unknown universes. The history of humanity canbe seen as our trials in misunderstanding this universal truth. Yet the secretof Pluto’s power is the knowledge of how shadow and light, when combined,produce the unification of the opposites, the balance point of yin and yang, thealchemical transcendence of the limitations of our physical form and reality. Inshort, Magic. Real Magic, not the flummery of Harry Potter, but the kind ofmagic that allows us to glimpse our reality from the perspective of the gods.The truth of our world is that it is an extension of our psyche: every outerexploration brings us more into contact with the components of our deepest Self,the Soul. As above, so below; this is the truth of the psyche as well as thebackbone of the art and science of astrology. As we send a mechanical extensionof our eyes and ears to the farthest reaches of the known solar system, we alsosend our psyche there, to witness physical objects that will inevitably havetheir corresponding effect on the inner reaches of our consciousness. Like ourtinkering with the atoms of uranium, we have little knowledge of where thisexploration will lead us, or how it will cause us to evolve.Pluto’s realm, the underworld, is often characterized by and confused with therealm of hell, a fiery tortuous territory of eternal punishment, or a place ofeternal sorrow. It is indeed the land of the dead. But archetypally, this landis a numinous land: it is the land of Soul. It is only dark to our mortal eyes,which cannot directly see into the immortal inner planes of the territory of theSoul. Thus Pluto is the bringer of light—the enlightening energy of Soul we mustdraw upon when the mundane worlds of ego and personality fail us, as eventuallythey must.Perhaps the New Horizons probe will find a scientific anomaly of such magnitudethat Pluto will forever point us into deeper, more infinite directions ofinexplicable wonder. More likely, our clearer vision of Pluto will be a simplymarker point in human history. As we face greater threat from the poisoning ofour environment by humankind’s deliberate ignorance fostered by greed, and theerosion of our stable climate and weather patterns, we may be forced into greatchanges in the way we do business here on planet Earth. Faced with cataclysm, wemay have to drop our pettiness, our nationalism, our war budgets, and spend ourmoney on helping out great numbers of people in need. This is how Pluto workswhen we fail to consciously recognize the need for change. Its effects areinexorable.A very important astrological cycle will also conclude in 2015, the square(90-degree angle) between Uranus and Pluto, which began in 2012. Uranus inAries, the sudden awakener, and Pluto the transformer last met in this hardaspect in the years 1932–34 (just two years after Pluto’s sighting) and set thestage for large-scale shifts of power in our world. We are now at that launchingpad again, with a shift in emphasis from Pluto in Cancer in the 1930s to nowPluto in Capricorn, where it was in 1776. (Due to Pluto’s eccentric 248-yearorbit, it passes through some signs much faster than others.) There is greatspeculation as to the future of the United States after 2022, when Pluto returnsto its place in the national birth chart (right around Independence Day, 2022).A Pluto return heralds powerful, enormous changes. Doubtless this country willnot be the same thereafter. Change requires destabilization and breakdown beforethe United States will let go of its fascination with itself as a world power.We can already see the seeds of this as we face our multiple trillion dollardebt, crying poor and cutting social programs while spending exorbitant (andunaccountable) amounts on war machines. This is the end, and the beginning ofsomething new.Pluto’s appearance before our eyes will awaken deep stirrings in our collectiveunconscious, just as landing on the Moon in 1969 created a tidal wave of psychicenergy as we looked back from the Moon and saw our tiny Earth floating in space.The Moon astrologically represents our emotions and feelings, while Pluto’seffect is to deepen, magnify, and stir within us our most primitive andinstinctual drives, the kind that erupt spontaneously as crowds, mobs, protests,or “flash mobs” and sparks of profound revelation. The Moon is a very visibleforce, Pluto’s force is hidden deep underground.Since the probe is speeding by at 36,000 miles per hour, it will only spendtwenty-four hours taking pictures and measurements of Pluto, but even theseglimpses will unlock wonder and imagination within our collective human mind.Symbolically we are trying to peer through the veil of the limits of ourconsciousness. It seems we are asking for a clearer vision of the dark god whorules over the powerful instinctual energies that are deep within us all.Pluto’s realm may be deemed dark and dangerous only because we have become soenamored of our egos that we refuse to see the limits of our power, toacknowledge our smallness in the face of the great unknown. If we are to learnfrom our indigenous ancestors and their practices, we can strengthen ourcontainer, our bodies, our communities, by calling upon the helping spirits ofthat realm, who were known to be readily available to us in times previous toour present Age of Reason. When we partner with the unknown, rather than fearit, we take a step toward the unification of the opposites, the small “I” andthe larger “we,” the individual and the collective, the conscious and theunconscious. When we release the hypnotic hold of the material world, theboundaries begin to blur, and we enter into the realm of the hidden forces thatpower the material world, call it spirit, or archetypes, or quantum energies.Our worldview shifts and we begin to see shapes in the stories of our lives thatbespeak the pattern of Magic that flows through our days, throughsynchronicities, powerful dreams, by meeting the right people at the perfecttiming in our lives.The deep volcanic power within the earth need not destroy our lives if we listento the earthquakes that precede eruptions. Similarly, if we pay attention to thesigns and signals that our reality continuously sends us (when we are quiet andstill enough to listen) we can create safety and refuge and see our way into thefuture. Pluto’s darkness may be the doorway to discovering our eternal Self, toseeing beyond the ego’s desires and prejudices, to the discovery of the guidanceof Soul with all its thirst for experience, understanding, and knowledge of thegreat Universe we are enwombed within.Our visit to that cold icy world may be the signal to humanity that it is timefor us all to learn how to cozy up together and create mutual warmth in thesharing of our stories. That it is time to discover we all need all of us,together, in order to survive the vestiges of past horrors we have inflictedupon each other and our planet. Pluto strips away boundaries, nationalities,racial prejudice, everything we use to separate ourselves from others out offear. It is the power of Oneness. It shows us how common the experiences of lifeare that we share, despite differences of language, color, or custom.The essence of any long-term relationship is our ability to repair and continue.Out of the ashes of our self-destruction can come the restoration of our world,a rebirth of Soul. The synchronicity of the name of the New Horizons probe, aswell as its timing in the history of the country that sent it, are harbingers ofa new era of the humble awareness of our dark powers, the history of ourself-destructive designs, and the beginning of the restoration of Soul upon thisfragile planet we call home."},{"pageContent":"11.....OUR LADY OF PLUTO, THE PLANET OF PURIFICATIONJIM TIBBETTSThe myth called Our Lady of Pluto is a story in which a mysterious lady in aglobe of light glided by the planet Pluto six times in 1917—something itremembers quite well. The planet Pluto has a consciousness as all planets have aconsciousness, one that is holistic and integrated with a memory of past eventsand future possibilities. Pluto is a very important planet, if not the mostimportant one, because it is the omega point of the solar system of Earth, andthe reflecting point of purification.Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S. J. was a French paleontologist who lived from1881 to 1955. He articulated a new dimension to evolution: a spiritualdimension. He taught that there is an unfolding of the universe as a physicalevolution and alongside this is the unfolding of the universe as a spiritualevolution. The Jewish-Christian development over the last 3,700 years hasthought in terms of a single linear development of their faiths. Teilhardstarted to see the universe in an integral way, not just in the fundamentalsubjective/objective dualism of most Western thought. Along with this is hiscentral idea of a complexification of consciousness. The evolution of theuniverse is a deepening of human consciousness or intelligence that includes adeepening of interiority and spirituality. It is a biological-spiritual processgrowing together.Human evolution continues as is but Teilhard had a sense that a deep change,like a transformation or conversion, at the level of being—a change of heart, achange of mind, a change of body—can take place in a human who learns toexperience the universe with divine action. This becomes a mystical event in thelife of the individual; it can be called mysticism or divinization. This alsoexists for a planet that evolves, has a planetary consciousness, a heart andthoughts.Teilhard is known for his “omega point,” which is the point the universe hasbecome one with God. It is an event that the universe is moving toward in thefuture and that is exerting a force on the present. The Western mind usuallythinks of the omega point in linear terms, but for Teilhard it is in holisticterms: the omega point is radiating back from the future into the present, thusthe future is here and now. Planet Pluto is the “omega point” for the solarsystem; it is a reflecting point of Earth’s consciousness and events, reflectingthese events back to the Earth.A person’s positive and negative beliefs not only impact a person’s health butalso every aspect of his or her life. Teachers like Buddha and Jesus have beentelling us the same story for millennia. Positive thoughts are a biologicalmandate for a happy, healthy life. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi:Your beliefs become your thoughtsYour thoughts become your wordsYour words become your actionsYour actions become your habitsYour habits become your valuesYour values become your destiny.The planet Pluto has thoughts and a consciousness, one that is holistic andintegrated with beliefs and thoughts that are part of its history and destiny.Though it is cold and icy, dark and distant, it lives on with its planetaryconsciousness. One moment in history brings Pluto great joy: it is the presenceof the bright luminous globe with a beautiful lady inside that floated by once amonth for six consecutive months.Pluto is the planet of purification. It is a mystery how it became a planet ofpurification; many reasons have been given but all fall short in the ocean ofspeculation. Perhaps since it’s the farthest planet from the Sun, the maininstrument of purification, its hermetical lifestyle throughout the agessublimed itself as the omega point for absolution, a cleansing of consciousness.Pluto, a small planet about one-sixth the size of the moon, is made up of mostlyrock and ice. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was originally classified as the ninthplanet from the Sun. After 1930 many eyes started looking at the planet Plutoand its consciousness became aware of those humans looking at it from the planetEarth. Yet, Pluto will always remember the globe, with the beautiful lady oflight, which passed by it six times in 1917, an event that elevated itsplanetary consciousness forever.Putting the speculation aside let us turn toward the science and faith ofpurification in one of the Earth’s most ardent promoters, the Judeo-Christiantradition. The spirit of purification first started with Adam and Eve. Tens ofthousands of years went by and the caveman never achieved this art form, thiswisdom of deep space. Abraham, Moses, and the Jewish tradition picked up on thisscience and art form and attempted to live it out. At the end of the lineage ofthe prophets came the prophet Rabbi Jesus; his first words in his mission were,“Purify thyself, for the kingdom of God is at hand.” His mother radiatedpurification itself. She lived on throughout time and came back to Earth tospread a purified lifestyle.Planet Pluto does not think like humans do, but experiences emotions and imagesand power and beauty in a two dimensional way. All things that are beingpurified come to Pluto and bounce off this omega point, reflecting it back toits source as a purified experience or image.One six-month period on the thirteenth day of every month from May to October itexperienced a luminous globe with a beautiful lady floating by it in its orbitaround the sun. The light from it radiated a purity and compassion it had neverexperienced before. The purity that radiated out from the event, taking place onEarth in Fatima, Portugal, was bounced back to the pure core of the planetPluto. This event was called an apparition of this beautiful Lady; the storyfrom Pluto’s memory follows thus:First Apparition: the orbit of Pluto first sees this glowing globe pass byWhen the prayers are finished, the three children were just about to resumetheir games, when suddenly a bright flash of lightning blinded them. Afraid of agathering storm in spite of the cloudless sky, Lucia (the visionary who spoke tothe Lady) made up her mind to go back home. But scarcely had they taken a fewsteps in the direction of a young oak tree when a second flash of lightening,brighter than the first, brought them to a standstill, frightened and trembling.On their right, in the blinding light, a young lady (so Lucia describes her) ofdazzling beauty appeared before their timid eyes. With a motion of her hand, shereassured them: “Do not be afraid, I shall not hurt you.” And so they remainedthere in ecstasy contemplating it. The beautiful lady spoke to Lucia for aminute and then rose up into the air floating away on that day, May 13, 1917.This radiated out to Pluto who beamed it back.Second Apparition: Pluto experiences purity from the globe as never beforeThe globe of light descended again from the heavens and Pluto rejoiced. Thisfirst apparition was spoken about to everyone’s amazement and only about fiftypeople betook themselves to Cova da Iria, most of them through curiosity for thesecond apparition on June 13. Suddenly Lucia made a gesture of surprise: “Look,”she said, “that was a flash of lightning, the Lady is coming!” Throughout theapparition, the witnesses, who did not see the Vision nor hear what she said,noticed that the sunlight had lost some of its brilliance, and that theatmosphere had become yellow-gold. The others heard something that sounded likea very gentle voice but did not understand what was said. “It is like the gentlehumming of a bee,” someone whispered.When the apparition ended, the curious onlookers approached the oak to examineit. It was covered with long new leaves, for it was June. They found that allthe leaves of the little tree were bent over toward the east, as if the hem ofthe Lady’s mantle had brushed over them as she turned and moved away in thatdirection. They had heard Lucia’s questions but had neither seen nor heard theLady. Pluto listened to words but did not understand.Third Apparition: the luminous globe with the lady passed by Pluto with colorssuperbThe fifty people who had witnessed the apparition of June 13 spread the news ofit throughout the surrounding districts, and on Friday, July 13, more than fivethousand were hurrying on their way to Cova da Iria. The sun turned hazy and arefreshing breeze began to blow. The silence of the crowd was impressive. Thenthey began to hear a hum as of a gadfly within an empty jug, but did not hear aword.Looking closely, they saw something like a small grayish cloud hovering over theholm oak. During the apparition the spectators noticed that in addition to thesunlight’s becoming dull, a little white cloud surrounded the children andcovered the scene of the apparition. Some of the bystanders noticed that thelight of the sun seemed dimmer during the following minutes, through the sky wascloudless. These images impressed themselves on Pluto.Fourth Apparition: the globe passed by Pluto filling its heart-center with loveOn Monday, August 13, the newspapers estimated the crowd at Fatima at eighteenthousand persons. At the exact hour of the apparitions, the attention of all wasdrawn to the tree by a loud explosion. Then followed the flash of lightning,which usually announced the coming of the Lady. The three child visionaries didnot show up since they were taken away and interrogated by the police.From the midst of the clear sky a clap of thunder broke, and a brilliant flashof lightning shot through the heavens. The sun began to lose its brilliance andthe atmosphere showed a great array of colors. The sun grew pale; the atmospherebecame dull yellow; a light cloud very beautiful in form and bright appearedabove the tree of the apparitions, remained there a few minutes, and finallyrose and rose toward the heavens where it disappeared. Everyone’s face glowed,rose, red, blue, all the colors of the rainbow. The trees seemed to have nobranches or leaves but were all covered with flowers; every leaf was a flower.The ground was in little squares, each one a different color. Their clothesseemed to be transformed also into the colors of the rainbow. The two vigillanterns hanging from the arch over the holy spot appeared to be of gold. Thecrowd was delighted. No one had seen the heavenly Lady, but these extraordinaryphenomena, already observed at the previous apparitions, showed clearly that OurLady had come to the meeting place.Even though the children were not there, it was half past one when a column ofsmoke rose precisely from the spot where the children had been in the previousvisitations. It was a thin, feeble, bluish column that rose straight up, twometers perhaps, above the heads of the people, and then broke up. Thisphenomenon, clearly visible to the naked eye, lasted a few seconds. The smokebroke up quite quickly and after a while the phenomenon repeated itself a secondtime and a third time. The tall columns were clearly seen in the gray atmospherethree times, principally the last.The children did not see the beautiful lady on the August 13, but on August 15in the afternoon the children were with the sheep in the pasture and feltsomething supernatural approaching. They saw a flash of light and then Our Ladyappeared over a holmoak tree. Lucia asked, “What do you want of me?” Sheanswered, “I want you to continue going to the Cova da Iria on the 13th, and tocontinue praying the Rosary every day. In the last month, I will perform amiracle so that all may believe.” The dialogue continued and when finished theLady rose up into the air surrounded by her globe floating off into space.Fifth Apparition: the beautiful lady in the globe radiates a stream of lightcovering Pluto’s planetFrom the previous evening (September 12) a witness wrote, “I saw the endlessstream of people coming from a distance on foot in order to see the apparition;on the following day the crowd gathered at Fatima at about thirty thousand. Iwas deeply moved, and more than once tears came to my eyes on seeing the piety,the prayers and ardent faith of the many thousands of pilgrims who recited theRosary on the way. There was not a road or pathway that was not full of people,and never before in all my life had I witnessed such a glorious and movingmanifestation of faith.”Several times, the sun lost its brightness as some clouds covered it, and theclouds became in turn white, red, and yellow. These same hues were reflected inthe faces of all present. Everyone was convinced that something extraordinarywas happening. At noon, though not a single cloud was to be seen, the glorioussun of the radiant day began to lose its brilliance to such a degree that thestars were visible! The atmosphere became a golden yellow. Distinctly many saw aglobe of light advancing from east to west, gliding slowly and majesticallythrough the air. Then suddenly the globe with its wonderful light disappearedfrom sight.At this moment, a light cloud was seen to form about the tree. A white cloudthen hid the top of the oak, and at times the whole tree, together with thechildren. Lucia again spoke to the beautiful Lady but no one heard anything.(After the globe ascended) Oh, Miracle!—from the limpid and cloudless sky therebegan to rain upon those present a shower, as it were, of white flowers, whichon coming near the Earth vanished without touching it. Many rose petals fell.They came from the sun in large quantities. When high in the air they were largebut on approaching the people they became small and vanished. Men held out theirhats to collect them, but when they tried to hold them they found nothing.Everyone looked at the luminous globe, until it disappeared in the direction theplanet Pluto.Sixth Apparition: the energy of this luminous globe empowers Pluto as neverbeforeOur Lady had promised Lucia a miracle on the last apparition, October 13. Fromthe eve, October 12, all the roads to Fatima were already packed with carriages,bicycles, and an immense crowd of pilgrims reciting the Rosary and singinghymns, on their way to the site of the apparitions, where they were going tospend the night in the open. It might be called a general mobilization to go andhear the message from heaven, and to see the promised miracle that was toauthenticate the message. Though no one knew in what the miracle would consist,each was determined to see it at firsthand.The morning of October 13 was disappointing, for contrary to all expectations itwas wet, gloomy, and cold. It seemed as if heaven wished to test the faith anddevotion of the pilgrims, and to make them merit, by a hard sacrifice, the honorof witnessing the promised miracle. But the bad weather did not check in any waythe crowd that gathered even from the frontiers of the country, while reportersand photographers from the big newspapers were there to get the facts.The continuous rain had transformed the place of the apparitions, which is ahollow, into a vast mud pit, and all, pilgrims or curious, were drenched to theskin or frozen with the cold. Shortly before midday, an observer estimated thecrowd at about seventy thousand.Suddenly, Lucia gave a slight start, and cried: “There is the lightning.” Thenraising her hands she added: “See, She is coming! She comes! Do you see Her?”Lucia no longer heard; she was in ecstasy. The clouds of smoke vanished as theluminous globe ascended.Immediately the clouds opened wide, exposing an immense surface of blue. In thecloudless area the sun appeared at its zenith, but with a strange aspect. Forthough not a single cloud veiled it, while being very bright, it was notdazzling, and you could look straight at it at will. Everybody looked insurprise at this new kind of eclipse.Suddenly the sun trembled, was shaken, made some abrupt movements, and finallybegan to turn giddily on itself like a wheel of fire, casting in all directions,like an enormous lamp, great beams of light. These beams were in turn green,red, blue, violet, etc., and colored in a most fantastic manner the clouds,trees, rocks, the Earth, the clothes and faces of this immense crowd, whichextended as far as the eye could see.After about four minutes the sun stopped. A moment later it resumed a secondtime its fantastic motion and its fairy-like dance of light and color such ascould never be imagined in the most gorgeous display of fireworks. Once more,after a few minutes, the sun stopped its prodigious dance, as it to give thespectators a rest. After a short stop and for the third time, as if to give theman opportunity of examining the facts carefully, the sun took up again morevaried and colorful than ever, its fantastic display of fireworks without adoubt the most glorious and most moving that had ever been seen on this Earth.All through these unforgettable twelve minutes, during which this unique andgripping spectacle lasted, the enormous multitude was there in suspense,immovable, almost in ecstasy, breathless, contemplating this moving drama, whichwas seen distinctly within a radius of more than twenty-five miles.It was the terrible fall of the sun that was the culminating point of the greatmiracle, the most awful moment and the most divinely moving. Indeed in the midstof its crazy dance of fire and colors, like a gigantic wheel which from spinninghas swung off its axis, so now the sun left it place in the firmament, andfalling from side to side, plunged zigzagging upon the crowd below, sending outa heat increasingly intense.And with one accord, falling on their knees in the mud the spectators recited ina voice choking with sobs the most sincere act of contrition that had ever comefrom their hearts. Finally, stopping short in its vertiginous fall, the sunclimbed back to its place, zigzagging as it had come down, and ended bygradually regaining its usual brilliance set in a limpid sky.Moving detail: this apocalyptic scene full of majesty and terror ended with adelicate gift, which shows the motherly tenderness of the Heart of thisbeautiful Lady for Her children. Through all had been drenched to the skin, eachnow had the pleasant surprise of feeling quite comfortable, their clothes beingabsolutely dry, and the puddles of water on the ground had also dried up.All of this radiated from the Earth to Pluto and it experienced all of thisradiating back the purity and purification that came to it from all these peopleand this last apparition. The luminous globe with the beautiful Lady floated byPluto one last time, a time to remember in Pluto’s pure memory bank. This eventmarked a turning point in Pluto’s evolutionary development, one that it will bemarked with joy and purity forever more.And this myth, Our Lady of Pluto, is a true story, just recounted as a myth thatlives on in the heart of Pluto and those who contemplate its existence."},{"pageContent":"12......LOVE SONG FOR PLUTOSHELLI JANKOWSKI-SMITHI am sure you are familiar with the myth of Persephone, who was forciblyabducted by Pluto and snatched away into the underworld.

I expected to visit them all. Imemorized their names in grade school, tracked their orbits along the ceiling ofthe Copernican room in the Hayden Planetarium where replicas of the planetsrevolved around a replica of the Sun; or rather six of them did, because theorbits of the other three if built to scale, according to a lecturer in popularastronomy, would put them outside of the building, and distant Pluto, discovereda mere fifteen years before I was born, would be inscribing its long, lazyellipse between the north end of the Central Park reservoir and the Automat onForty-Sixth and Broadway. My two favorite books were The Conquest of Space andAcross the Space Frontier, not so much for the text by (among others) Willy Leyand Wernher Von Braun, though that wasn’t bad, but for the illustrations byChesley Bonestell, an architectural designer and Hollywood special effectsartist whose close-up renderings of remote planetscapes were both precise andbreathtaking. Saturn was his specialty—Saturn as a ringed, spectral presence,visible only in outline in the sky above Titan; Saturn as an enormous spinningball looming, yellow and lopsided, over the rim of Mimas. He imagined thesurface of Pluto, its serrated ridges, spreading fields of ice, and above it, hedepicted our Sun in the vast blackness of space, slightly larger and brighterthan other stars but not at all conspicuous. If Life Magazine or Colliers laidout the military or economic argument for space travel, it was Bonestell whoincited the delirious interplanetary desire that Kubrick would revive a decadelater.Space travel in those days was the jewel in the crown of the Future—the sexypart of it—and the Future was still thriving then. Disney had made it into afranchise called Tomorrowland. General Electric kept advertising its immanentarrival with the slogan, “Progress is our most important product.” Robots to dothe shit work, colonies on the moon, orbiting hotels with grand Cinemascopicviews, flying cars and jetpacks for navigating through multilevel rush hourtraffic back on Earth: what was not to like? Guaranteeing the bright panoramasawaiting us, authorizing the show from behind the curtain so to speak, was aninvisible wizard, a tall Englishman with a mustache by the name of John MaynardKeynes. In a 1930 essay called “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,”the world’s most famous economist had peered into his crystal ball to discernthe outlines of life on Earth in 2030.He saw an Age of Abundance ahead. Automation will have reduced what Marx called“the working day” to three hours. The “absolute needs” of food, clothing, andshelter will have been met. As for merely “relative needs” like yachts or highstatus toys, needs driven by the desire to feel the equal or the superior toothers—by what Rousseau would call envy, Rene Girard (in a more complex key)mimetic desire, and 1950s American sociologists “keeping up with theJoneses”—these illusory needs, though seemingly limitless, will slowly losetheir power to compel people to work when the possibilities of more free timebecome clear. “For the first time since his creation man will be faced with hisreal, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares,how to occupy the leisure which science and compound interest will have won forhim.” True, Keynes never imagined the exploration of space as a solution to theproblem of leisure, but space opera SF often presupposes a Keynesianpost-scarcity world. Social theorist Peter Frase noted this while watching StarTrek: the Next Generation. The technological conditions for Star Trek World are(1) a replicator “that can make instant copies of any object with no input ofhuman labor,” and (2) an unlimited source of free energy via the magic ofanti-matter or dilithium crystals. “There is no money, everyone has access towhatever resources they need, and no one is required to work. Liberated from theneed to engage in wage labor for survival, people are free to get in spaceshipsand go flying around the galaxy for edification and adventure.” (Interestingly,Frase calls this postcapitalist society “Communism.”)“The Real,” says Slavoj Zizek, “is the disavowed X on account of which ourvision of reality is anamorphically distorted.” Pluto was first referred to asPlanet X, a hypothetical, an absent presence suggested by perturbations in theorbit of Uranus not attributable to Neptune. X indicates the unknown in analgebraic equation. X marks the spot on a treasure map or the files no one maysee. X can refer to that which exceeds a situation or that which structures oneaccording to a principle incompletely understood. Sometimes I frame my life’sjourney as an unconscious quest for an X factor, the invisible planet that threwthe Future off course. I wasn’t aware of any such X on July 20, 1969 when NeilArmstrong stepped down from the lunar module onto the surface of the moon. Sure,I’d seen the visible cracks in the Future. Vietnam. Alabama. Newark. Watts. Butstanding before a TV in Burlington, Vermont with two fellow actors from theChamplain Shakespeare Festival and a group of kids from Harlem sent up to theGreen Mountain state for an outdoor experience, watching the tiny figure in aspacesuit work his way down the ladder onto the Sea of Tranquility, theinterplanetary future seemed big enough for all of us. For all mankind, in fact.Still, there were two people, a Briton and an American, the best SF writers oftheir era (or perhaps any), who understood at the time that the Age of SpaceTravel was already over, that the Promised Future would never arrive.Chapter Three of The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch is Philip K. Dick’sbleakest vision of settler society, a Mars outpost well on its way to becomingthe next Lost Colony of Roanoke. Driven from Earth by the onset of globalwarming, the settlers live in hovels, listless, troglodytes in a drearylandscape waiting for resupply by a monthly UN space shuttle. No one works anymore. They do a lot of drugs. The hydro-pumping system is in disrepair,irrigation ditches are filled with sand, and microscopic native pests shred theleaves of abandoned gardens. Favorite pastime: playing Ken-and-Barbie with dollsnamed Walt and Pat in a layout of a furnished world. The drug of choice, anillegal substance called Can-D, enables them to literally inhabit their Walt andPat dolls and experience “the near sacred moment in which the miniatureartifacts of the layout no longer merely represented Earth but became Earth.”Somehow they project themselves into Perky Pat’s sunny, futuristic SanFrancisco: they can jet around in a Jaguar XXB flying car or slip into bathingsuits and picnic on the beach, untroubled by the future. (“It’s going to behotter … But we won’t live that long.”) Ontological uncertainty persists,however, even in the giddy whirl of pleasure. Are the gameplayers in adrug-induced hallucination, they wonder, or have they really been translatedsomehow from Mars to Earth?In his brilliant story, “The Cage of Sand,” J. G. Ballard actually brings Marsback to Earth, millions of tons of Martian topsoil dumped as ballast on thecoast near Cape Canaveral because the much-lowered gravitational mass producedby the continuous launching of rockets and space probes threatens, if notremedied, to alter the Earth’s orbit and send it closer to the Sun, resulting inhigher temperatures, loss of the ozone layer, and destruction of the biosphere.Unfortunately, the Martian topsoil contains a virus deadly to plant life. (“Alltoo soon it was found that the microbiological analysis of the sand had beeninadequate.”) So much for geo-engineering. In the aftermath, Cape Canaveral is aruin. Around it are ghost towns. Abandoned motels. Submerged chalets. Intactcocktail lounges with names like The Orbit Room or The Satellite Bar, theirhalf-occluded signs stuck in the red sand amid rusting fragments of Marsrockets. Living in this landscape of disaster where old launching gantries andlanding ramps rear up into the sky “like derelict pieces of giant sculpture,”evading the Wardens who patrol the fenced-in area to enforce a quarantine, are atypical group of Ballardian obsessives drawn to a catastrophe that mirrors theirinner lives. Louise Woodward has returned to the last place she saw her husbandalive. An astronaut whose vessel failed to make contact with a space platform,his body orbits the Earth in its capsule, periodically intersecting the orbitingcapsules of six other dead astronauts, Russian and American, killed on otherfailed missions over the past fifty years. Every night, she keeps her vigil,waiting for her husband to pass overhead. Travis is a failed astronaut. He losthis nerve during the countdown “lying flat on his back on a contour couch twohundred feet above the launching pad,” costing the aerospace company fivemillion dollars. “Night after night, he watched the brilliant funerary convoyweave its gilded pathway toward the dawn sun, salving his own failure byidentifying it with the greater but blameless failure of the seven astronauts.”Certainly global warming is a huge X looming over us. That alone would makethese stories relevant but it’s not what makes them resonate for me. It’s theway they transform the indefinitely postponed future into the uncanny. Failureis the default mode in both Ballard and Dick. They’d seen it on TV every nightin the Vietnam War, despite the can-do attitude of the generals, and theyimagined it spreading its stain over things to come. Ballard even inscribes itinto nature by having the funerary capsules become celestial objects “shiningwith the intensity of second-magnitude stars.” Each new object is given the nameof the dead astronaut inside it—Connolly, Tkachev, Woodward, Maiakovski—part ofan “orbiting Zodiac,” a new constellation. “They were disposed in a distinctivebut unusual pattern resembling the Greek letter x …” Ah, that X again! I caneven locate a metaphorical X in Dick’s novel, the planet Pluto itself, athreshold between the human and the alien. From out of a spaceship crash landingon the surface of the planet emerges Palmer Eldritch, intergalactic drugdealer/entrepreneur. Eldritch (or his alien simulacrum) has returned fromProxima Centauri bringing with him a new hyper-addictive drug. Unlike the Can-Dingested by Mars colonists, which allows them to share the pleasant experienceof Perky Pat’s world, Chew-Z imprisons each user in his or her own solipsisticworld. (“There’s no such thing as society,” a British prime minister might thinkif she was using it, the neo-liberal drug of choice.) Factor in that thesemyriad worlds are all controlled by Palmer Eldritch and you’re left with anothermodel of an outside X not immediately perceivable inside the world itstructures.In 1930, eleven days after the celestial X finally revealed itself to ClydeTombaugh of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, the new planet wasgiven the name Pluto. Some etymology. Πλουτος (ploutos) is the Greek word forwealth. As a proper noun (ΠΛΟΥΤΟΣ), it refers to the Greek god of wealth, Plutus(not to be confused with Pluto, the Roman God of the underworld). From πλουτοςcome words like plutocracy (rule by the wealthy) and plutonomy (defined in ahelpful report from Citigroup as an economy in which there is no averageconsumer, only the rich and the rest). Wealth, I have come to believe, is thePlanet X I’ve been searching for, the invisible object whose gravitational pullcauses the perturbations in the orbits of our lives, but for reasons which I’llclarify when we examine why Keynes’s vision of life in 2030 was so out of whack,why that Radiant Future beamed into my head in the ’50s—that future of leisureand abundance and space travel for all—seems to have been cancelled, I want tocall this Planet X “Capital.”Keynes’s essay reads now like a work of fantastic literature. Three-hour day?Fifteen-hour workweek? According to a Gallup Poll (Sept. 2, 2014, WashingtonPost), an average workweek in the United States is 46.7 hours with 21 percent ofworkers clocking in 50-59 per and 18 percent working 60 plus hours (only 13percent of workers like their jobs). Wealth for all through the “miracle ofcompound interest”? Tell that to students, payday loan customers, and underwaterhomeowners collectively compounding a debt that can never be repaid. Here arethe prices—the astronomical prices—paid by high-net-worth individuals insoftware, telecom, and finance to hitch a ride on a Soyuz rocket out to theRussian space station: Dennis Tito, twenty million dollars (2001); MarkShuttleworth, twenty million dollars (2002); Gregory Olson, twenty milliondollars (2005); Anousheh Ansari, twenty million dollars (2006); Charles Simonyi,twenty million dollars (2007), thirty-five million dollars for a second trip(2009); Richard Garriot, thirty million dollars (2008). My imp of the perversewants to connect these numbers to a Keynesian sentence heavy with the ruins ofthe Future: “They (the wealthy classes) are, so to speak, our advanceguard—those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitchingtheir camp there.” No author should be booted from the canon for failing topredict the future; otherwise Marx wouldn’t be essential reading. What Keynesfailed to see was the present. He pulled off the incredible feat of savingcapitalism without, in fact, knowing what it is he saved. To understand whyCapital always promises a future it can never deliver, a return to Star Trek isnecessary.Recall that sociologist Peter Frase pointed out how Star Trek is set in apost-scarcity world with advanced technology and renewable energy. Economics,often defined as the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends, has noplace here. Nor does wage labor, private enterprise, or the pursuit of profitsince the Replicator can make an infinite number of copies of anything one couldpossibly want. Frase then poses the question: How could Star Trek World betransformed into a capitalist society? His answer: intellectual property.Require a license to be bought for every product created and immediately thereis a need for lawyers to draw up licenses, ways to earn money to buy thelicenses, guard labor to work in prisons to confine violators of the terms ofuse and so on, until pretty soon competition and profit are driving the system.In short, create artificial scarcity. What’s the point of this thoughtexperiment? If the fictions of a State of Nature and the Social Contractillustrate the liberal view of a political society grounded in an agreementbetween individuals, Frase’s leftist fable of the Anti-Star Trek Society revealsin an elegant way the core of capitalism. Take away scarcity, production,exchange, and you’re still left with Capital’s interminable drive to expand, itsneed to reconfigure whatever world it finds itself in so it can continue tovalorize. This is what Keynes totally misses. Underpinning his vision of thefuture, as noted, is a distinction between absolute needs, which the economy cansatisfy, and relative needs, which are limitless but insubstantial. But there isa limitless need that keeps the system going and it’s not a human need.The question Keynes should have asked is: What does Capital need? It wasn’t asif hordes of deadbeat poor people were swarming into banks begging for sub-primeloans, as the Tea Party tells the story; it’s that bankers were cold-callingeveryone in the phone directory because of the never-ending market imperative tokeep returns rolling in, and fees from guaranteed-to-fail loans generated higherones than traditional banking. Money always wants more money (just likeinformation wants to be free). What Capital needs to do is to keep reproducingitself, to keep the ball rolling. If it needs to sell you the same things againand again, cars every few years, DVDs in the Special Edition, the Director’sCut, the Blu-Ray, the superfragilistic Xeno Ray, it will find a way to do so. Ifclothing sales are peaking, it will invent Brands. If water is a publicresource, it will privatize it and sell it back to you. This need to keepexpanding is inscribed within the system. Keynes’s mistake was to reduce anobjective economic structure to an effect of psychology. The circuit of Capitalis like a treadmill that will never stop on its own, a parody of Nietzsche’seternal return, a scratched LP that just keeps repeating the same notes, M-C-M(Marx’s shorthand for Money—Commodity—Money), and the promise of a future ofabundance and cool new gadgets for everyone is just another ingredient thatkeeps the machine running, a lure for versions of the ten-year-old me in the’50s, poring through illustrated SF magazines and haunting planetariums.This year, a fragment of that lost future known as the past has floated into myconsciousness again. On July 14–15, 2015, an unmanned NASA space probe will flyby the surface of Pluto. Launched on January 19 in 2006, it will have taken nineand a half years to reach the outer edge of our solar system, the long slow timeof interplanetary travel. Mission time is not the time of our lives, nor thefrantic, hopped-up time of the reproduction of Capital along its circuits. NewHorizons, as this voyage of discovery is called, is the third attempt to mount amission to Pluto. The first two efforts, Pluto Fast Flyby and Pluto KuiperExpress, were aborted because of budget cuts. In the end, space travel is amirror of the present. While astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson appeals to Congressfor an infinitesimal raise in funds for NASA, libertarian millionaires hop ridesto the Russian Orbital Station, another bit of Soviet state property auctionedoff to ex-apparatchiks in the great neoliberal fire sale. Maybe these bozos needan escape route off a planet their enterprises have trashed. Or maybe there’llbe a mass exodus and our solar neighborhood will end up resembling some dementedversion of a Kim Stanley Robinson novel. Maybe every moon, asteroid, meteor,ring, and plutino capable of being terraformed into a habitable berth by a bravenew technology will become a city, cabana, or time-share, an apodment in someextraterrestrial Tokyo or Manhattan. Or maybe not. Maybe what Alex Williams andNick Srnicek call “the promissory note of the mid-Twentieth Century’s spaceprogrammes” will turn out to be redeemable when all bank-issued debt isworthless. Maybe a new wave of Left techno-social imagining can reinvent spacetravel as a form of aesthetic play, an energetics of eternal delight to take theplace of work. History is full of surprises, another way of saying that theletter X will still haunt us.So what will the probe find on Pluto? A black monolith? The ruins of PalmerEldritch’s crashed ship? An outside to Capital? I’ll be curious to see.

That elementaffects the true maturation of sulfur—the red brimstone of our wisdom withoutwhich we wouldn’t bother cultivating the elite science. Red sulfur alone is afine medicine, but ultimately we must progress through the eight (or nine)stages of Mercury’s magic mirror to acquire the lights of complete maturity. Soin a sense, it is between Mercury and Pluto that the whole idea or theory isproperly grasped. This system originated in India and China, but its adaptationsto European thought have intrigued poets and scholars for centuries.Like the Pluto assemblage out at the edge of our solar system, this agent worksquickly upon the peripheries of certain of the elements and also certainreceptive molecules containing those elements, eventually penetrating andsoftening them all with Eros—the mysterious aspect of the eternal ether(Sanskrit: Akash) that pours from it as flux pours liquid from a magnet. It is auniversal, and the change it brings joins and harmonizes. It is in this one ofthe best kept secrets of our divine art. Similarly, Pluto’s orbit does notconform to the other orbits of the planets, and so it is that angle ofeccentricity coupled with its penetrating drive that enables its sacred,encompassing journey of ingress with the other orbs’ orbits about our Sun:We watch the swarming Pluto as he winds his crafted way—To circumnavigate the altar of his siblings, father SolOn an elliptic lane—not the ecliptic planeAs the others all conforming dutifully must roll.We watch the swarm of Pluto as the alchemist of fateTips his patient hand to shine a brighter light the lawsOf physical phenomena—a glimpse into our competentIndustry initiate philosophers give pause.Our solar system is one of countless, such that were conceived and brought aboutlong ago by a magical process we do not understand. We are in the glass vesselof the Creator. A lifetime study of all the mysteries including geometry,mathematics, alchemy and its chemistries, telescope, and microscope, may one dayillumine the adages “As above and within, so below and without,” and “Soul, knowyourself.”I’d like to suggest a top ten of possible things we may find happening as aresult of our finally arriving at the Pluto group:1. We may find that just as Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was changedto Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone for a dumbed-downed American audience,no one will really care about the Pluto probe’s findings unless the coverage istweaked down a tad here in the States. Maybe start with the rag sheets and everso gradually work up to No’ Adams.2. Really though, when we finally are in propinquity to the Pluto pride, we’llrecognize debating is over and new data gathering is just beginning. Thisresults in the reopening of the debate around the family dinner table inBrooklyn when Jr. declares, “Hey Mom, I just found out that Pluto’s more like abinary entity and only one in a swarm of kindred objects—go figure!” Dad says,“Huh?”3. Nassim Haramein’s suggestion that the planets are not rotating about our Sunbut instead are in a swarming corkscrew tagalong as old Sol speeds through spacewill prove to have greater clarity from the angle of Pluto.It may take a swarm to see a swarm.4. We may find evidence to support our Pluto having secretly been the initialinspiration for Sitchin’s Nibiru (Lowell’s Planet X), in spite of him workinglike a master sculptor to adapt and stretch the feasibility of an objectconsiderably surpassing Pluto’s 248-year transit about our star. Nibiru must becold indeed, explaining the heartless treatment of the hapless Igigi. Tsk, tsk.5. It is not impossible we may find that the six objects of the Pluto swarm,viz. Pluto, Kerberos, Nix, Charon, Styx, and Hydra, are actually worthy of beingreclassified as small planetoids, each of which themselves has five moons, witheach of them in turn having five sub-lunar spheres, and each of them in turnfive, and so on. This finding results in the probe making a concerted effort tomap the first interstitial space fractal—the detailing creating a feedback loopthat shuts its communications systems down.6. Not believing the fractal story behind the shutdown, some scientists may findthat the swarm is in realty a sort of disparate black dwarf in the final stagesof collapse. This creates concern for the future of neighboring Neptune.7. Not believing either of the above, another group of scientific observersseizes the opportunity to lay blame on incompetency, making the case that weshould have been prudent, waited longer, saved our money, and then abandon thewhole idea in favor of a bigger space telescope.8. The long held belief that Pluto & co. is so small—especially as it followsthe gas and ice giants of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune away from ourSun—becomes compromised in lieu of the discovery that the region is filled withan equally giant, nearly undetectable transparent quartz sphere owning a smallfrigid core of rotating parts mimicking Vatican City.9. We may finally put an end to the debate over whether an Irishman, Scot, orRussian can exist anywhere near Pluto when it becomes clear that the climate isinhospitable for growing barley, wheat, hops, and even potatoes.10. We may discover that, having made the effort to explore every major objectin our solar system, a friendly alien species of humanoid form will deem theoccasion opportune for first contact. They will not share their advancements intechnology however, instead accepting speaking engagements at key centers oflearning to lecture on how far we still have to go before we are civilizedenough to stop mixing Greek and Roman deities in the nomenclature of solarsystem objects.What do I think the probe will find?A bit more than our scientists expect. But unlike the finding of fresh marrowtissue within the petrified bones of T. rexes in Montana a few years ago (asshown on 60 Minutes), they’ll be able to explain most everything without anymonstrous gaps in their knowledge base.What would I like it to find?A telling key to reveal the living nature of galaxies through the cumulativeunderstanding that our own was designed and encoded to a small spermatic seedbefore release in the Big Orgasm along with uncountable others. I would like tofind that, like some exquisitely planned and flawlessly executed pyrotechnicalsingularity, the Big O will be realized in time as a creation intended toprepare and populate virtually infinite space-time in the physical realm withconscious life in unending variety.What would change some key paradigm or meaning?Just the fact that we actually completed researching all the largest knownobjects in our solar system will change the model and the meaning of spaceexploration. It’s about species maturation through the fulfillment of desireborn of practical curiosity—and in a perfect world clears the air for moreadvanced and peaceful pursuits that we can all share in. But honestly, thisisn’t a perfect world, so how can we continue to foot the bill for the enormousexpenses while still making real and timely progress?East Indian masters first popularly introduced to the West the inborn ability weall possess to see and explore the cosmos internally with a simple reversal ofthe attention. We may access a faculty that is conveniently connected toeverything—and it’s basically free of charge.Notes1.

MURPHY1. Planet of WomenPluto is a totally female totalitarian society run by the masked Queen Illyanawith an atmosphere amazingly similar to Earth’s. The queen banished all males toa moon because they were responsible for the nuclear war that left her faceburned, now hidden behind a mask. Her warriors dress like Rockettes, carrylethal rayguns, and live in the capital city of Kadia somewhat reminiscent ofancient Bagdad. Contact with Earth encourages the rebels led by Talleah tofoment a revolution, eventually destroying Illyana’s people and her deadly BetaDestructor aimed at Earth.2. Anthromorphia DisnophiniaThe Pluto mission finds a strange world populated by anthropomorphic “animals”(dogs, cats, mice, ducks) who wear clothes and speak English. Oddly, thecitizens of the planet have mute “pets” which resemble hairless primates withfeatures resembling Homo sapiens. They dress their pets in faux animal fur.3. Cthulhu CalamariA planet of hyper intelligent squid-like creatures inhabiting all ecologicalniches. Their leaders call themselves the “Old Ones.” They have their ownlanguage and culture but understand English and have expressed an interest inexchanging diplomats with Earth, claiming it is their rogue colony. They areupset to hear that calamari is a popular food on Earth.4. Genital Face PlanetThis planet is inhabited by a race of beings similar to male and female (andintersexed) Homo sapiens except that their “faces” resemble human genitalia. Itis determined that under their clothing they conceal organs resembling humanfaces that they cover up in public. These “lower faces” do not speak butfunction primarily for excretion and reproduction through variations on “Frenchkissing.”5. Teenage Werewolf Vampire PlanetThere are two dominant species on this planet, both with a relatively shortlifespan. The vampires feed primarily on the blood of a specially bred humanoidpopulation. The second dominant species, the werewolves, are primarilycarnivorous (raiding the brood humanoid population of the blood-sucking species)but also hunting wild animals. In order to eat or fight they change at will intolarge canines (wolves). The two main species are periodically at war but arealso capable of intermarriage. Successful interspecies mating can produce ahybrid subspecies with somewhat random characteristics of its parents. Thedominant species cooperate in planetwide competitive games similar to ourOlympics.6. Mad Water World MaximilliaThere is very little dry land on this ocean planet. Its great seas are filledwith myriad fish, amphibian, and aquatic mammalian life. There is one humanoidspecies with rudimentary gills living on boats, subsisting primarily on fishingand practicing agriculture on floating debris islands of recycled organicmatter. The few islands of dry land are inhabited by a warlike humanoid speciesscavenging in the dystopian remnants of a carbon energy-based industrialcivilization. When the two species interact it is primarily via the piratingraids of the land dwellers on the mutant “gill people.”7. Fifty-Eight Genders PlanetThe following genders have been catalogued on this planet: Agender, Androgyne,Androgynous, Bigender, Cis, Cisgender, Cis Female, Cis Male, Cis Man, Cis Woman,Cisgender Female, Cisgender Male, Cisgender Man, Cisgender Woman, Female toMale, FTM, Gender Fluid, Gender Nonconforming, Gender Questioning, GenderVariant, Genderqueer, Intersex, Male to Female, MTF, Neither, Neutrois,Non-binary, Other, Pangender, Trans, Trans*, Trans Female, Trans* Female, TransMale, Trans* Male, Trans Man, Trans* Man, Trans Person, Trans* Person, TransWoman, Trans* Woman, Transfemmine, Transgender, Transgender Female, TransgenderMale, Transgender Man, Transgender Person, Transgender Woman, Transmasculine,Transsexual, Transsexual Female, Transsexual Male, Transsexual Man, TranssexualPerson, Transsexual Woman, Two-Spirit, Male, Female.8.

As you approach your car, a strangercalls out, “Hey! Funny weather today!” With a due sense of caution—is she aglobal warming denier or not?—you reply yes. There is a slight hesitation. Is itbecause she is thinking of saying something about global warming? In any case,the hesitation induced you to think of it. Congratulations: you are living proofthat you have entered the time of hyperobjects. Why? You can no longer have aroutine conversation about the weather with a stranger. The presence of globalwarming looms over the conversation like a shadow, introducing strange gaps. Orglobal warming is spoken—either way the reality is strange.A hyperobject has ruined the weather conversation, which functions as part of aneutral screen that enables us to have a human drama in the foreground. In anage of global warming, there is no background, and thus there is no foreground.It is the end of the world, since worlds depend on backgrounds and foregrounds.World is a fragile aesthetic effect around whose corners we are beginning tosee. True planetary awareness is the creeping realization not that “We Are theWorld,” but that we aren’t.Why? Because world and its cognates—environment, nature—are ironically moreobjectified than the kinds of “object” I am talking about in this study. Worldis more or less a container in which objectified things float or stand. Itdoesn’t matter very much whether the movie within the context of world is anold-fashioned Aristotelian movie of substances decorated with accidents or amore avant-garde Deleuzian one of flows and intensities. World as the backgroundof events is an objectification of a hyperobject: the biosphere, climate,evolution, capitalism (yes, perhaps economic relations compose hyperobjects). Sowhen climate starts to rain on our head, we have no idea what is happening. Itis easy to practice denial in such a cognitive space: to set up, for example,“debates” in which different “sides” on global warming are presented. Thistaking of “sides” correlates all meaning and agency to the human realm, while inreality it isn’t a question of sides, but of real entities and human reactionsto them. Environmentalism seems to be talking about something that can’t be seenor touched. So in turn environmentalism ups the ante and preaches the comingapocalypse. This constant attempt to shock and dismay inspires even moredefiance on the opposite side of the “debate.”Both sides are fixated on world, just as both sides of the atheism debate arecurrently fixated on a vorhanden (“present at hand”), objectively present God.As irritating for New Atheists such as Richard Dawkins to hear that atheism isjust another form of belief, it nevertheless is—or at any rate, it holds exactlythe same belief about belief as the fundamentalists. Belief is a token, a mentalobject that you grip as hard as possible, like your wallet or car keys. Inexactly the same way, it is annoying for environmentalists to talk about ecologywithout Nature. The argument is heard as nihilism or postmodernism. But reallyit is environmentalism that is nihilist and postmodernist, just asfundamentalism’s belief about belief marks it as a form of ontotheologicalnihilism. The ultimate environmentalist argument would be to drop the conceptsNature and world, to cease identifying with them, to swear allegiance tocoexistence with nonhumans without a world, without some nihilistic Noah’s Ark.In any weather conversation, one of you is going to mention global warming atsome point. Or you both decide not to mention it but it looms over theconversation like a dark cloud, brooding off the edge of an ellipsis.1This failure of the normal rhetorical routine, these remnants of shatteredconversation lying around like broken hammers (they must take place everywhere),is a symptom of a much larger and deeper ontological shift in human awareness.And in turn, this is a symptom of a profound upgrade of our ontological tools.As anyone who has waited while the little rainbow circle goes around and aroundon a Mac, these upgrades are not necessarily pleasant. It is very much the jobof philosophers and other humanities scholars to attune ourselves to theupgrading process and to help explain it.What is the upgrading process? In a word, the notion that we are living “in” aworld—one that we can call Nature—no longer applies in any meaningful sense,except as nostalgia or in the temporarily useful local language of pleas andpetitions. We don’t want a certain species to be farmed to extinction, so we usethe language of Nature to convince a legislative body. We have a general feelingof ennui and malaise and create nostalgic visions of hobbit-like worlds toinhabit. These syndromes have been going on now since the Industrial Revolutionbegan to take effect.As a consequence of that revolution, however, something far bigger and morethreatening is now looming on our horizon—looming so as to abolish our horizon,or any horizon. Global warming has performed a radical shift in the status ofthe weather. Why? Because the world as such—not just a specific idea of worldbut world in its entirety—has evaporated. Or rather, we are realizing that wenever had it in the first place.We could explain this in terms of the good old-fashioned Aristotelian view ofsubstance and accidents. For Aristotle, a realist, there are substances thathappen to have various qualities or accidents that are not intrinsic to theirsubstantiality. In section Epsilon 2 of the Metaphysics, Aristotle outlines thedifferences between substances and accidents. What climate change has done isshift the weather from accidental to substantial. Aristotle writes, “Suppose,for instance, that in the season of the Cynosure [the Dog Days of summer] arcticcold were to prevail, this we would regard as an accident, whereas, if therewere a sweltering heat wave, we would not. And this is because the latter,unlike the former, is always or for the most part the case.”2But these sorts of violent changes are exactly what global warming predicts. Soevery accident of the weather becomes a potential symptom of a substance, globalwarming. All of a sudden this wet stuff falling on my head is a mere feature ofsome much more sinister phenomenon that I can’t see with my naked human eyes. Ineed terabytes of RAM to model it in real time (this has been available forabout ten years).There is an even spookier problem arising from Aristotle’s arctic summer idea.If those arctic summers continue, and if we can model them as symptoms of globalwarming, then there never was a genuine, meaningful (for us humans) swelteringsummer, just a long period of sweltering that seemed real because it kept onrepeating for, say, two or three millennia. Global warming plays a very meantrick. It reveals that what we took to be a reliable world was actually just ahabitual pattern—a collusion between forces such as sunshine and moisture andhumans expecting such things at certain regular intervals and giving them names,such as Dog Days. We took weather to be real. But in an age of global warming wesee it as an accident, a simulation of something darker, more withdrawn—climate.As Harman argues, world is always presence-at-hand—a mere caricature of somereal object.3Now let’s think the evaporation of world from the point of view of foregroundand background. A weather conversation provides a nice background to our dailyaffairs, nice to the extent that we don’t pay too much attention to it.Precisely for it to be a background, it has to operate in our peripheral vision.Thus, the conversation about the weather with a stranger is a safe way toacknowledge our coexistence in social space. It’s “phatic,” according to RomanJakobson’s six-part model of communication; that is, it draws attention to thematerial medium in which the communication is occurring.4 Likewise, the weatheras such is a background phenomenon. It might loom distressingly into theforeground as a tornado or as a drought, but most often those are temporaryaffairs—there is a larger temporal backdrop against which they seem to occur asisolated incidents.Now what happens when global warming enters the scene? The background ceases tobe a background, because we have started to observe it. Strange weather patternsand carbon emissions caused scientists to start monitoring things that at firstonly appeared locally significant. That’s the old definition of climate: there’sthe climate in Peru, the climate on Long Island, and so on. But climate ingeneral, climate as the totality of derivatives of weather events—in much thesame way as inertia is a derivative of velocity—is a beast newly recognized viathe collaboration of weather, scientists, satellites, government agencies, andother entities. This beast includes the Sun, since it’s infrared heat from theSun that is trapped by the greenhouse effect of gases such as CO2. So globalwarming is a colossal entity that includes entities that exist way beyondEarth’s atmosphere, and yet it affects us intimately, right here and now. Globalwarming covers the entire surface of Earth, and 75 percent of it extends fivehundred years into the future. Remember what life was like in the early 1500s?Global warming is really here—even more spookily, it was already here, alreadyinfluencing the supposedly real wet stuff falling on my head and the warm goldenstuff burning my face at the beach. That wet stuff and that golden stuff, whichwe call weather, turns out to have been a false immediacy, an onticpseudo-reality that can’t stand up against the looming presence of an invisibleyet far more real global climate. Weather, that handy backdrop for humanlifeworlds, has ceased to exist, and along with it, the cozy concept oflifeworld itself. Lifeworld was just a story we were telling ourselves on theinside of a vast, massively distributed hyperobject called climate, a storyabout how different groups were partitioned according to differenthorizons—concepts now revealed as ontic prejudices smuggled into the realm ofontology. Global warming is a big problem, because along with melting glaciersit has melted our ideas of world and worlding. Thus, the tools that humanistshave at their disposal for talking about the ecological emergency are nowrevealed, by global warming itself, to be as useless as the proverbial chocolateteapot. It is rather like the idea of using an antique (or better, antiqued)Christmas ornament as a weapon.The spooky thing is, we discover global warming precisely when it’s alreadyhere. It is like realizing that for some time you had been conducting yourbusiness in the expanding sphere of a slow-motion nuclear bomb. You have a fewseconds for amazement as the fantasy that you inhabited a neat, seamless littleworld melts away. All those apocalyptic narratives of doom about the “end of theworld” are, from this point of view, part of the problem, not part of thesolution. By postponing doom into some hypothetical future, these narrativesinoculate us against the very real object that has intruded into ecological,social, and psychic space. As we shall see, the hyperobject spells doom now, notat some future date. (Doom will assume a special technical meaning in this studyin the “Hypocrisies” section.)If there is no background—no neutral, peripheral stage set of weather, butrather a very visible, highly monitored, publicly debated climate—then there isno foreground. Foregrounds need backgrounds to exist. So the strange effect ofdragging weather phenomena into the foreground as part of our awareness ofglobal warming has been the gradual realization that there is no foreground! Theidea that we are embedded in a phenomenological lifeworld, tucked up like littlehobbits into the safety of our burrow, has been exposed as a fiction. Thespecialness we granted ourselves as unravelers of cosmic meaning, exemplified inthe uniqueness of Heideggerian Dasein, falls apart since there is nomeaningfulness possible in a world without a foreground–background distinction.Worlds need horizons and horizons need backgrounds, which need foregrounds. Whenwe can see everywhere (when I can use Google Earth to see the fish in my mom’spond in her garden in London), the world—as a significant, bounded, horizoningentity—disappears. We have no world because the objects that functioned asinvisible scenery have dissolved.5World is an aesthetic effect based on a blurriness and aesthetic distance. Thisblurriness derives from ignorance concerning objects. Only in ignorance canobjects act like blank screens for the projection of meaning. “Red sky at night,shepherd’s delight” is a charming old saw that evokes days when shepherds livedin worlds bounded by horizons on which things such as red sunsets occurred. TheSun goes down, the Sun comes up—of course now we know it doesn’t: Galileo andCopernicus tore holes in that notion of world. Likewise, as soon as humans knowabout climate, weather becomes a flimsy, superficial appearance that is a merelocal representation of some much larger phenomenon that is strictly invisible.You can’t see or smell climate. Given our brains’ processing power, we can’teven really think about it all that concretely. At the very least, world meanssignificantly less than it used to—it doesn’t mean “significant for humans” oreven “significant for conscious entities.”A simple experiment demonstrates plainly that world is an aesthetic phenomenon.I call it The Lord of the Rings vs. the Ball Popper Test. For this experimentyou will need a copy of The Two Towers, the second part of director PeterJackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy.6 You will also require a Playskool BusyBall Popper, made by Hasbro. Now play the scene that I consider to be theabsolute nadir of horror, when Frodo, captured by Faramir, is staggering aroundthe bombed-out city Osgiliath when a Nazgûl (a ringwraith) attacks on a “fellbeast,” a terrifying winged dragon-like creature.Switch on the Ball Popper. You will notice the inane tunes that the Popper playsinstantly undermine the coherence of Peter Jackson’s narrative world.The idea of world depends on all kinds of mood lighting and mood music,aesthetic effects that by definition contain a kernel of sheer ridiculousmeaninglessness. It’s the job of serious Wagnerian worlding to erase the traceof this meaninglessness. Jackson’s trilogy surely is Wagnerian, a total work ofart (Gesamtkunstwerk) in which elves, dwarves, and men have their own languages,their own tools, their own architecture, done to fascist excess as if they weredifferent sports teams. But it’s easy to recover the trace of meaninglessnessfrom this seamless world—absurdly easy, as the toy experiment proves. In effect,this stupid kids’ toy “translated” the movie, clashing with it and altering itin its own limited and unique way.Objections to wind farms and solar arrays are often based on arguments that they“spoil the view.”7 The aesthetics of Nature truly impedes ecology, and a goodargument for why ecology must be without Nature. How come a wind turbine is lessbeautiful than an oil pipe? How come it “spoils the view” any more than pipesand roads? You could see turbines as environmental art. Wind chimes play in thewind; some environmental sculptures sway and rock in the breeze. Wind farms havea slightly frightening size and magnificence. One could easily read them asembodying the aesthetics of the sublime (rather than the beautiful). But it’s anethical sublime, one that says, “We humans choose not to use carbon”—a choicevisible in gigantic turbines. Perhaps it’s this very visibility of choice thatmakes wind farms disturbing: visible choice, rather than secret pipes, runningunder an apparently undisturbed “landscape” (a word for a painting, not actualtrees and water). As a poster in the office of Mulder in the television seriesThe X-Files says, “The Truth Is Out There.” Ideology is not just in your head.It’s in the shape of a Coke bottle. It’s in the way some things appear“natural”—rolling hills and greenery—as if the Industrial Revolution had neveroccurred, and moreover, as if agriculture was Nature. The “landscape” look ofagriculture is the original “greenwashing.” Objectors to wind farms are notsaying “Save the environment!” but “Leave our dreams undisturbed!” World is anaesthetic construct that depends on things like underground oil and gas pipes. Aprofound political act would be to choose another aesthetic construct, one thatdoesn’t require smoothness and distance and coolness. World is by no means doingwhat it should to help ecological criticism. Indeed, the more data we have, theless it signifies a coherent world.World is a function of a very long-lasting and complex set of social forms thatwe could roughly call the logistics of agriculture. New Zealand is anastonishing place where there are fifteen sheep for every human, a hyperbolicblowup of the English Lake District. It was deliberately manufactured that way.World is not just an idea in your head. It’s in the way the fields roll toward ahorizon, on top of which a red setting sun augurs peace and contentment. It’s inthe smooth, lawn-like texture of sheep-nibbled grass: “First the labourers aredriven from the land, and then the sheep arrive.”Wind farms are an eyesore on this aestheticized landscape. Agriculture, in thisview, is an ancient technological world-picture, to use Heidegger’s terms: aform of framing that turns reality into so much stuff on tap (Bestand).9Agriculture is a major contributor to global warming, not just because offlatulent cows, but because of the enormous technical machinery that goes intocreating the agricultural stage set, the world. Perhaps the solution to this issuggested by the kinds of “perverse” technologies developed by pot farmers: tocreate intensive growth in a small space. Just as the porn industry acceleratedthe development of the Internet, so the drug industry might be our ecologicalsavior. Stranger things have happened. Preserving the agricultural world picturejust as it is, however, has already become a costly disaster.To return to an example close to New Zealand’s heart, The Lord of the Ringspresents an agricultural landscape that never explains itself. Sure, the Rangerssuch as Aragorn protect it. But how does it work? For whom and with whom is thegrowing and the harvesting and the selling done? Hobbiton is constructed toinduce nostalgia for a suburban future that thinks itself as a Georgic idyll. Todo so requires all kinds of lighting, rendering, and mood music—it also requiresthe threats of Mordor and orcs that make us care about bland suburbia. Justchanging the Wagnerian music would destroy its delicate “balance.”Village Homes is a world-like real illusion that rests in the northwest area ofDavis, California. Each street is named after a place or person in The Lord ofthe Rings: Evenstar Lane, Bombadil Lane. The streets are concentric yetnontopologically equivalent, so there is a real feeling of being lost in there.There are vineyards and pomegranate trees. There is a village-green-like spacewith an amphitheater built into the grass. There is a children’s day care calledRivendell. It is all very beautiful; it’s very well done. There is already anostalgia for the present there, not simply for Tolkien, but for an ecologicalvision of the 1970s when Village Homes was designed. There is one slightproblem: you have to have an awful lot of money to live there. And there is arule that you have to work in the collective allotments. As a friend quipped,“One homeowner’s association to rule them all.”There are many reasons why, even if world were a valid concept altogether, itshouldn’t be used as the basis for ethics. Consider only this: witch-duckingstools constitute a world just as much as hammers. There was a wonderful worldof witch ducking in the Middle Ages in which witches were “discovered” bydrowning them, strapped to an apparatus that submerged them in the local stream:if the supposed witch didn’t drown, she was a witch—and should thus be burned atthe stake. Witch ducking stools constituted a world for their users in everymeaningful sense. There is a world of Nazi regalia. Just because the Nazis had aworld doesn’t mean we should preserve it. So the argument that “It’s goodbe—cause it constitutes a world” is flimsy at best. The reason not to interferewith the environment because it’s interfering with someone’s or something’sworld is nowhere near a good enough reason. It might even have perniciousconsequences. World and worlding are a dangerously weak link in the series oflate-Heideggerian concepts.10 It is as if humans are losing both their world andtheir idea of world (including the idea that they ever had a world) at one andthe same time, a disorienting fact. In this historical moment, working totranscend our notion of world is important. Like a mannerist painting thatstretches the rules of classicism to a breaking point, global warming hasstretched our world to breaking point. Human beings lack a world for a very goodreason: because no entity at all has a world, or as Harman puts it, “There is nosuch thing as a ‘horizon.’”11 The “world” as the significant totality of what isthe case is strictly unimaginable, and for a good reason: it doesn’t exist.What is left if we aren’t the world? Intimacy. We have lost the world but gaineda soul—the entities that coexist with us obtrude on our awareness with greaterand greater urgency. Three cheers for the so-called end of the world, then,since this moment is the beginning of history, the end of the human dream thatreality is significant for them alone. We now have the prospect of forging newalliances between humans and nonhumans alike, now that we have stepped out ofthe cocoon of world.About six minutes into Pierre Boulez’s piece Répons, the percussive instrumentscome in. They surround the smoother instruments (brass, strings), which areplaying in a square in the center of the concert hall. The percussiveinstruments (piano, dulcimer, harp, and so on) are processed through variousdelays and filters. The sound of their entry is now evocative of speculativerealism: the sound of a vaster world bursting into the human, or the reverse,the sound of a trapdoor opening in a plane, or the plane itself disappearing sowe find ourselves in the wide blue sky. A terrifying, wonderful sound, theKantian sublime of inner freedom giving way to a speculative sublime ofdisturbing intimacy. The sound of the end of the world but not an apocalypse,not a predictable conclusion. The sound of something beginning, the sound ofdiscovering yourself inside of something.Boulez himself probably thought Répons was about the sound of modern humantechnology, Gesellschaft (modern “society”) impinging on Gemeinschaft (the“organic community”), and so forth. Or the idea of a dialogue between equalpartners, a dialectical play between the organic and electronic. The piece ismuch more that that. It’s the sound of real entities appearing to humans. But asI’ve been arguing, real nonhuman entities appear to humans at first as blips ontheir monitors. But they are not those blips. The sound of a higher-dimensionalconfiguration space impinging on extreme Western music (total serialism). Thesound of hyperobjects. The sound of a nonmusic. Listen to the very end: thesound echoes and reverberates, repeating glissandos; then, suddenly, it’s over.No fade out. Robert Cahen captures it well in his deceptively simple film ofRépons, visualizing the “human sounds” as a traditional orchestral ensemblejuxtaposed with revolving and panning shots of trees, and the percussive soundsas humans mediated by a luminous ocean.12 When the percussive instruments enter,the camera on the orchestra pans back to reveal them surrounding the otherplayers, and we see the studio lighting rig, as if the structures that hold thefragile fiction of world together have evaporated. Just as most of Earth’ssurface is water, the sonic space is surrounded by the chilling, sparklingsounds of piano, harp, and glockenspiel.Instead of trying constantly to tweak an illusion, thinking and art andpolitical practice should simply relate directly to nonhumans. We will never“get it right” completely. But trying to come up with the best world is justinhibiting ecological progress. Art and architecture in the time of hyperobjectsmust (automatically) directly include hyperobjects, even when they try to ignorethem. Consider the contemporary urge to maximize throughput: to get dirty airflowing with air conditioners. Air conditioning is now the benchmark of comfort;young Singaporeans are starting to sweat out of doors, habituated to thehomogeneous thermal comfort of modern buildings.13 Such architecture and designis predicated on the notion of “away.” But there is no “away” after the end ofthe world. It would make more sense to design in a dark ecological way,admitting our coexistence with toxic substances we have created and exploited.Thus, in 2002 the architectural firm R&Sie designed Dusty Relief, anelectrostatic building in Bangkok that would collect the dirt around it, ratherthan try to shuffle it somewhere else.14 Eventually the building would be coatedwith a gigantic fur coat of dirt.15Such new ideas are counterintuitive from the standpoint of regular post-1970senvironmentalism. Process relationism has been the presiding deity of thisthinking, insofar as it thinks flows are better than solids. But thinking thisway on a planetary scale becomes absurd. Why is it better to stir the shitaround inside the toilet bowl faster and faster rather than just leaving itthere? Monitoring, regulating, and controlling flows: Is ecological ethics andpolitics just this? Regulating flows and sending them where you think they needto go is not relating to nonhumans. Regulation of flows is just a contemporarymode of window dressing of the substances of ontotheological nihilism, thebecomings and processes with which Nietzsche wanted to undermine philosophy.Contemporary architecture and design is thinking beyond models based on vectorsand flow. When one considers Earth or the biosphere as a whole, pushingpollution “somewhere else” is only redistributing it, sweeping it under thecarpet. Reproduced by permission. The common name for managing and regulatingflows is sustainability. But what exactly is being sustained? “Sustainablecapitalism” might be one of those contradictions in terms along the lines of“military intelligence.”16 Capital must keep on producing more of itself inorder to continue to be itself. This strange paradox is fundamentally,structurally imbalanced. Consider the most basic process of capitalism: theturning of raw materials into products. Now for a capitalist, the raw materialsare not strictly natural. They simply exist prior to whatever labor process thecapitalist is going to exert on them. Surely here we see the problem. Whateverexists prior to the specific labor process is a lump that only achievesdefinition as valuable product once the labor has been exerted on it.What capitalism makes is some kind of stuff called capital. The very definitionof “raw materials” in economic theory is simply “the stuff that comes in throughthe factory door.” Again, it doesn’t matter what it is. It could be sharks orsteel bolts. At either end of the process we have featureless chunks ofstuff—one of those featureless chunks being human labor. The point is to convertthe stuff that comes in to money. Industrial capitalism is philosophy incarnatein stocks, girders, and human sweat. What philosophy? If you want a “realism ofthe remainder,” just look around you. “Realism of the remainder” means that yes,for sure, there is something real outside of our access to it—but we can onlyclassify it as an inert resistance to our probing, a gray goo, to adapt a termsuggested by thinking about nanotechnology—tiny machines eating everything untilreality becomes said goo.It’s no wonder that industrial capitalism has turned the Earth into a dangerousdesert. It doesn’t really care what comes through the factory door, just as longas it generates more capital. Do we want to sustain a world based on aphilosophy of gray goo? (Again, the term that some futurologists use to describethe nightmare of nano-scale robots mashing everything up into a colorlessmorass.) Nature is the featureless remainder at either end of the process ofproduction. Either it’s exploitable stuff, or value-added stuff. Whatever it is,it’s basically featureless, abstract, gray. It has nothing to do with nematodeworms and orangutans, organic chemicals in comets and rock strata. You can scourthe earth, from a mountaintop to the Marianas Trench. You will never findNature. It’s an empty category looking for something to fill it.Rather than only evaporating everything into a sublime ether (Marx via Macbeth:“All that is solid melts into air”), capitalism also requires and keeps firmlong-term inertial structures such as families, as Fernand Braudel explored.17The Koch brothers and GE are two contemporary examples. One part of capital,itself a hyperobject, is its relentless revolutionizing of its mode ofproduction. But the other part is tremendous inertia. And the tremendous inertiahappens to be on the side of the modern. That is, the political ontology inwhich there is an “away.” But there is no “away” in the time of hyperobjects.Capitalism did away with feudal and prefeudal myths such as the divine hierarchyof classes of people. In so doing, however, it substituted a giant myth of itsown: Nature. Nature is precisely the lump that exists prior to the capitalistlabor process. Heidegger has the best term for it: Bestand (standing reserve).Bestand means “stuff,” as in the ad from the 1990s, “Drink Pepsi: Get Stuff.”There is an ontology implicit in capitalist production: materialism as definedby Aristotle. This specific form of materialism is not fascinated with materialobjects in all their manifold specificity. It’s just stuff. This viewpoint isthe basis of Aristotle’s problem with materialism. Have you ever seen or handledmatter? Have you ever held a piece of “stuff”? To be sure one has seen plenty ofobjects: Santa Claus in a department store, snowflakes, photographs of atoms.But have I ever seen matter or stuff as such? Aristotle says it’s a bit likesearching through a zoo to find the “animal” rather than the various speciessuch as monkeys and mynah birds.18 Marx says exactly the same thing regardingcapital.19 As Nature goes, so goes matter. The two most progressive physicaltheories of our age, ecology and quantum theory, need have nothing to do withit.What is Bestand? Bestand is stockpiling. Row upon row of big box houses waitingto be inhabited. Terabyte after terabyte of memory waiting to be filled.Stockpiling is the art of the zeugma—the yoking of things you hear in phrasessuch as “wave upon wave” or “bumper to bumper.” Stockpiling is the dominant modeof social existence. Giant parking lots empty of cars, huge tables inrestaurants across which you can’t hold hands, vast empty lawns. Nature isstockpiling. Range upon range of mountains, receding into the distance. RockyFlats nuclear bomb trigger factory was sited precisely to evoke this mountainousstockpile. The eerie strangeness of this fact confronts us with the ways inwhich we still believe that Nature is “over there”—that it exists apart fromtechnology, apart from history. Far from it. Nature is the stockpile ofstockpiles.What exactly are we sustaining when we talk about sustainability? Anintrinsically out-of-control system that sucks in gray goo at one end and pushesout gray value at the other. It’s Natural goo, Natural value. Result? Mountainranges of inertia, piling higher every year, while humans boil away in the agonyof uncertainty. Look at Manufactured Landscapes, the ocean of telephone dials,dials as far as the eye can see, somewhere in China.20 Or consider the giganticbillowing waves of plastic cups created by Tara Donovan in Untitled (PlasticCups) (2006). In massive piles, the cups reveal properties hidden from the viewof a person who uses a single cup at a time, a viscous (in my terms)malleability. In Donovan’s title, “cups” are in parentheses, the “untitled”outside parenthesis, as if to highlight the way the cups are “saying” somethingbeyond their human use: something unspeakable for a human. The title of no-titleplaces the work both inside and outside human social and philosophical space,like a garbage dump, an idea the gigantic pile surely evokes.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_042_r1.jpg]Figure 1.

What we have in modernity is considerably worsethan just instrumentality. Here we must depart from Heidegger. What’s worse isthe location of essence in some beyond, away from any specific existence. Tothis extent, capitalism is itself Heideggerian!Whether we call it scientism, deconstruction, relationism, or good old-fashionedPlatonic forms, there is no essence in what exists. Either the beyond is itselfnonexistent (as in deconstruction or nihilism), or it’s some kind of real awayfrom “here.” The problem, then, is not essentialism but this very notion of abeyond. This beyond is what Tara Donovan’s work destroys.Tony Hayward was the CEO of BP at the time of the Deepwater Horizon oil pipeexplosion, and his callousness made international headlines. Hayward said thatthe Gulf of Mexico was a huge body of water, and that the spill was tiny bycomparison. Nature would absorb the industrial accident. I don’t want to quibbleabout the difference in size between the Gulf and the spill, as if an evenlarger spill would somehow have gotten it into Hayward’s thick head that it wasbad news. I simply want to point out the metaphysics involved in Hayward’sassertion, which we could call capitalist essentialism. The essence of realityis capital and Nature. Both exist in an ethereal beyond. Over here, where welive, is an oil spill. But don’t worry. The beyond will take care of it.Meanwhile, despite Nature, despite gray goo, real things writhe and smack intoone another. Some leap out because industry malfunctions, or functions only toowell. Oil bursts out of its ancient sinkhole and floods the Gulf of Mexico.Gamma rays shoot out of plutonium for twenty-four thousand years. Hurricanescongeal out of massive storm systems, fed by the heat from the burning of fossilfuels. The ocean of telephone dials mounts ever higher. Paradoxically,capitalism has unleashed myriad objects upon us, in their manifold horror andsparkling splendor. Two hundred years of idealism, two hundred years of seeinghumans at the center of existence, and now the objects take revenge,terrifyingly huge, ancient, long-lived, threateningly minute, invading everycell in our body. When we flush the toilet, we imagine that the U-bend takes thewaste away into some ontologically alien realm.21 Ecology is now beginning totell us about something very different: a flattened world without ontologicalU-bends. A world in which there is no “away.” Marx was partly wrong, then, whenin The Communist Manifesto he claimed that in capitalism all that is solid meltsinto air. He didn’t see how a hypersolidity oozes back into the emptied-outspace of capitalism. This oozing real can no longer be ignored, so that evenwhen the spill is supposedly “gone and forgotten,” there it is, mile upon mileof strands of oil just below the surface, square mile upon square mile of oozefloating at the bottom of the ocean.22 It can’t be gone and forgotten—even ABCNews knows that now.When I hear the word sustainability I reach for my sunscreen. The deep reasonfor why sustainability fails as a concept has to do with how we are not livingin a world. It is thus time to question the very term ecology, since ecology isthe thinking of home, and hence world (oikos plus logos). In a reality without ahome, without world, what this study calls objects are what constitute reality.Objects are unique. Objects can’t be reduced to smaller objects or dissolvedupward into larger ones. Objects are withdrawn from one another and fromthemselves. Objects are Tardis-like, larger on the inside than they are on theoutside. Objects are uncanny. Objects compose an untotalizable nonwhole set thatdefies holism and reductionism. There is thus no top object that gives allobjects value and meaning, and no bottom object to which they can be reduced. Ifthere is no top object and no bottom object, it means that we have a verystrange situation in which there are more parts than there are wholes.23 Thismakes holism of any kind totally impossible.Even if you bracket off a vast amount of reality, you will find that there is notop and bottom object in the small section you’ve demarcated. Even if you selectonly a sector of reality to study somewhere in the middle, like they do inecological science (the mesocosm), you will also find no top or bottom object,even as it pertains to that sector alone. It’s like a magnet. If you cut it, thetwo halves still have a north and a south pole. There is no such thing as “half”a magnet versus a “whole” one.Why is holism such a bad idea? Surely there could be other possible holisms thatadopt some version of both–and thinking so that neither the parts nor thewhole—whatever the whole might be—are greater. Perhaps the parts are notnecessarily lesser than the whole but exist in some both–and synergisticfashion; you could have—simultaneously—“withdrawn” objects and something else(just to satisfy our modern need for things that aren’t static, let’s say anopen-ended, possibly always expanding, something else).First, we must walk through some semirelated points about this line ofquestioning. It sounds like good value to have “both–and” rather than“either–or,” to our somewhat consumerist minds (“buy one get one free”). But I’mafraid this is a case of either–or: holism or not. The parts are not replaceablecomponents of the whole. The more we open up the Russian doll of an object, themore objects we find inside. Far more than the first object in the series,because all the relations between the objects and within them also count asobjects. It’s what Lacanians call a not-all set. Objects in this sense arefundamentally not subject to phallogocentric rule. (Commercial break: If you’rehaving trouble with object at this point, why not try another term, such asentity?) What we encounter in OOO, which I have been expounding in these lastcouple of pages, is a Badiou-like set theory in which any number of affiliationsbetween objects can be drawn. The contents of these sorts of sets are biggerthan the container.Sometimes children’s books explore deep ontological issues. The title of A HouseIs a House for Me couldn’t be better for a book about ecology (see myobservation above about oikos and logos). The text is a wonderfully jumblyplethora of objects: Cartons are houses for crackers. Castles are houses forkings. The more that I think about houses, the more things are houses forthings.24 Home, oikos, is unstable. Who knows where it stops and starts? Thepoem presents us with an increasingly dizzying array of objects. They can act ashomes for other objects. And of course, in turn, these homes can find themselveson the inside of other “homes.”Home is purely “sensual”: it has to do with how an object finds itselfinevitably on the inside of some other object. The instability of oikos, andthus of ecology itself, has to do with this feature of objects. A house is theway an object experiences the entity in whose interior it finds itself. So thenthese sorts of things are also houses: A mirror’s a house for reflections … Athroat is a house for a hum … A book is a house for a story. A rose is a housefor a smell. My head is a house for a secret, a secret I never will tell. Aflower’s at home in a garden. A donkey’s at home in a stall. Each creaturethat’s known has a house of its own and the earth is a house for us all.25The time of hyperobjects is the time during which we discover ourselves on theinside of some big objects (bigger than us, that is): Earth, global warming,evolution. Again, that’s what the eco in ecology originally means: oikos, home.The last two lines of A House Is a House for Me make this very clear.To display the poem’s effortless brio, a lot of silly, fun “houses” arepresented in the penultimate section as we hurry toward the conclusion, whichthen sets the record straight by talking about a “real” house, the Earth. Butthis is not the case. OOO doesn’t claim that any object is “more real” than anyother. But it does discount some objects, which it calls sensual objects. Whatis a sensual object? A sensual object is an appearance-for another object. Thetable-for my pencil is a sensual object. The table-for my eyes is a sensualobject. The table-for my dinner is a sensual object. Sensual objects arewonderfully, disturbingly entangled in one another. This is where causalityhappens, not in some mechanical basement. This is where the magical illusion ofappearance happens. A mirror’s a house for reflections. Yes, the mesh (theinterrelatedness of everything) is a sensual object! Strange strangers are thereal objects! Some very important entities that environmentalism thinks of asreal, such as Nature, are also sensual objects. They appear “as” what they arefor an experiencer or user or apprehender. They are manifestations of whatHarman calls the asstructure.26 They are as-structured even though they appearto be some deep background to (human) events.This confusion of sensual and real, in the terms of A House Is House for Me, islike thinking that bread really is a house for jam, and jam alone. Rather thansimply an idea that occurs to me, and perhaps to the jam, when it finds itselfslathered in there. Marmalade wants in on the bread? Too bad, marmalade is anartificial, unnatural parasite! Peanut butter? Illegal alien! Only jam is“natural,” such that bread is only made-forjam. See the problem with Nature? InOOO-ese, reification is precisely the reduction of a real object to its sensualappearance-for another object. Reification is the reduction of one entity toanother’s fantasy about it.Nature is a reification in this sense. That’s why we need ecology withoutNature. Maybe if we turn Nature into something more fluid, it would work.Emergence is also a sensual object. And thus it’s in danger of doing the work ofreifying—strangely enough, given its reputation as an unreified, flowy thing,despite its popularity as a replacement for terms such as nature. Emergence isalways emergence-for. Yet there is a deeper way to think emergence. Physis,emergence, sway, the way a flower unfurls, seeming, upsurge of Being, are someof the terms Heidegger uses to characterize what he considers to be the primarynotion of the ancient Greek philosophers. There is an appearing-to, anemerging-for, going on. Being is not separated from seeming, at the mostfundamental stage of Heidegger’s account. And so there is no reason why a poemcan’t be construed as a physical object in as rich a sense as you like. It’sonly counterintuitive if you think that entities come with two floors: basementmechanics and a pretty living room on top. But for OOO, Heidegger’s terms forbeing are simply elaborations on the as-structure. Whether you call it emergenceor appearance, what we are talking about is a sensual object.Thinking on a planetary scale means waking up inside an object, or rather aseries of “objects wrapped in objects”: Earth, the biosphere, climate, globalwarming.27 Ecological being-with does not mean dusting some corner of an objectso one doesn’t feel too dirty. Ecological being-with has to do withacknowledging a radical uniqueness and withdrawal of things, not some vaguesludge of apeiron (using Anaximander’s term for “the limitless”). A circle, notan endless line, is a better emblem for the constraint, yet openness, ofthings.28 Indeed, the vague sludge is precisely the problem of pollution.Process relationism is simply the last philosophical reflex of the modernitythat creates the sludge. We need a philosophy of sparkling unicities; quantizedunits that are irreducible to their parts or to some larger whole; sharp,specific units that are not dependent on an observer to make them real.These are considerations concerning the normative value of different ontologies.But there is a deeper reason why hyperobjects are best seen not as processes,but as real entities in their own right. Seen from a suitably high dimension, aprocess just is a static object. I would appear like a strange worm with acradle at one end and a grave at the other, in the eyes of a four-dimensionalbeing. This is not to see things sub specie aeternitatis, but as I arguedpreviously, sub specie majoris: from a slightly higher-dimensional perspective.Processes are sophisticated from a lower-dimensional viewpoint. If we truly wantto transcend anthropocentrism, this might not be the way to go. To think somethings as processes is ironically to reify them as much as the enemy of theprocess philosopher supposedly sees things as static lumps. As static lumps go,Lorenz Attractors are pretty cool. Processes are equally reifications of realentities. A process is a sensual translation, a parody of a higherdimensionalobject by a lower-dimensional being. A hyperobject is like a city—indeed a citysuch as London could provide a good example of a hyperobject. Cities andhyperobjects are full of strange streets, abandoned entrances, cul-de-sacs, andhidden interstitial regions.The Nuclear Guardianship movement advocates an approach to nuclear materialsthat is strikingly similar to the way in which the electrostatic building simplyaccumulates dirt without shunting it under the rug.29 There is no away to whichwe can meaningfully sweep the radioactive dust. Nowhere is far enough orlong-lasting enough. What must happen instead is that we must care consciouslyfor nuclear materials, which means keeping them above ground in monitoredretrievable storage until they are no longer radioactive. Remember that thehalf-life of plutonium-239 is 24,100 years. That’s almost as long into thefuture as the Chauvet Cave paintings are in our past. The future of plutoniumexerts a causal influence on the present, casting its shadow backward throughtime. All kinds of options are no longer thinkable without a deliberateconcealment of the reality of radioactive objects. Far, far more effort must beput into monitored retrievable storage than Thomas Sebeok’s disturbing idea ofan “atomic priesthood” that enforces ignorance about the hyperobject inquestion.30 The documentary Into Eternity explores the immense challenge thatthe now immense heap of nuclear materials on Earth pose to thinking and todemocracy.31 The film is narrated for a far future addressee, displacing thespurious now, which we habitually think as a point or a small, rigid bubble.Guardianship, care—to curate is to care for. We are the curators of a giganticmuseum of non-art in which we have found ourselves, a spontaneous museum ofhyperobjects. The very nature of democracy and society—Whom does it contain?Only humans? Whom, if any, can it exclude?—is thrown into question. The atomicpriesthood would prevent others from knowing the truth.32 The attempt to carefor hyperobjects and for their distant future guardians will strikingly changehow humans think about themselves and their relationships with nonhumans. Thischange will be a symptom of a gradually emerging ecological theory and practicethat includes social policy, ethics, spirituality, and art, as well as science.Humans become, in Heidegger’s words, the guardians of futurality, “the stillnessof the passing of the last god.”33 Nuclear Guardianship has suggested encasingplutonium in gold, that precious object of global reverence and lust, ratherthan sweeping it away out of view. Encased in gold, which has the advantage ofabsorbing gamma rays, plutonium could become an object of contemplation. Setfree from use, plutonium becomes a member of a democracy expanded beyond thehuman. Nature as such is a byproduct of automation. By embracing thehyperobjects that loom into our social space, and dropping Nature, world, and soon, we have a chance to create more democratic modes of coexistence betweenhumans and with nonhumans. But these modes are not discernible withintraditional Western parameters, since future generations—and further futuresthan that, are now included on “this” side of any ethical or politicaldecision.34Nuclear Guardianship sees nuclear materials as a unit: a hyperobject. Thisvision summons into human fields of thinking and action something that isalready there. The summoning is to nuclear materials to join humans in socialspace, rather than remain on the outside. Or better, it’s an acknowledgment byhumans that nuclear materials are already occupying social space. It’s anintrinsically scary thought. But wishing not to think it is just postponing theinevitable. To wish this thought away is tantamount to the cleanup operationsthat simply sweep the contaminated dust, garbage, and equipment away to someless politically powerful constituency. As a member of society, nuclearmaterials are a unit, a quantum that is not reducible to its parts or reducibleupward into some greater whole. Nuclear materials constitute a unicity: finitudemeans just this. Nuclear materials may present us with a very large finitude,but not an infinitude. They simply explode what we mean by finitude. They arenot objective lumps limited in time and space, but unique beings.35 They haveeverything that Heidegger argues is unique to Dasein.Hyperobjects are futural, as the section “Interobjectivity” demonstrated. Theyscoop out the objectified now of the present moment into a shifting uncertainty.Hyperobjects loom into human time like the lengthening shadow of a tree acrossthe garden lawn in the bright sunshine of an ending afternoon. The end of theworld is not a sudden punctuation point, but rather it is a matter of deep time.Twenty-four thousand years into the future, no one will be meaningfully relatedto me. Yet everything will be influenced by the tiniest decisions I make rightnow.36 Inside the hyperobject nuclear radiation, I am like a prisoner, and afuture person is like another prisoner. We are kept strictly apart, yet I guesshis existence. There is a rumor going around the prison. If I make a deal withthe police and pin the blame for my crime on the other prisoner, and he saysnothing, I can go free and he receives a longer sentence. However, if I saynothing and he says nothing together, we both get a minor sentence. Yet if weboth betray the other, we receive an even longer sentence. I can never be surewhat the other will do. It would be optimal if I emphasize my self-interestabove all other considerations. Yet it would be best if I act with a regard tothe well-being of the other prisoner.This is the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In 1984 Derek Parfit published thegroundbreaking Reasons and Persons, a book that exploded long-held prejudicesabout utility and ethics from within utilitarianism itself. Parfit showed thatno self-interest ethical theory, no matter how modified, can succeed againstsuch dilemmas.37 Specifically Parfit has in mind hyperobjects, things such aspollution and nuclear radiation that will be around long after anyonemeaningfully related to me exists. Since in turn my every smallest actionaffects the future at such a range, it is as if with every action I am making amove in a massive highly iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. We might as wellrename it Jonah’s Dilemma or the Dilemma of the Interior of a Hyperobject.Default capitalist economics is rational choice theory, which is deeply aself-interest theory. Yet the Prisoner’s Dilemma indicates we’re profoundlysocial beings. Even self-interest accounts for the other somehow.Parfit subjects an astonishing array of self-interest theories (variouslymodified to include relatives, friends, neighbors, descendants, and so on) tonumerous tests based on the Prisoner’s Dilemma. The Prisoner’s Dilemmaencourages one to think about how change begins: one thinks of the other, onebrings the other into decisions that are supposedly about one’s self-interest.To this extent the Prisoner’s Dilemma is formally collectivist even though itlacks a positive collectivist or socialist content. The kinds of compromisenecessitated by the Prisoner’s Dilemma may strike ideological purists as weak.It is precisely this weakness that makes the so-called compromises workable andjust. Imagine a future self with interests so different from one’s own that tosome extent she or he constitutes a different self: not your reincarnation orsomeone else—you yourself. This person in the future is like the prisoner beinginterrogated in the other room. The future self is thus unimaginably distant inone sense, and yet hyperobjects have brought her into the adjoining prison cell.She is strange yet intimate. The best course of action is to act with regard toher. This radical letting go of what constitutes a self has become necessarybecause of hyperobjects. The “weakness” of this ethical position is determinedby the radical withdrawal of the future being: I can never fully experience,explain, or otherwise account for her, him, or it. The end of the world is atime of weakness.The ethics that can handle hyperobjects is directed toward the unknown andunknowable future, the future that Jacques Derrida calls l’avenir.38 Not thefuture we can predict and manage, but an unknowable future, a genuinely futurefuture. In the present moment, we must develop an ethics that addresses whatDerrida calls l’arrivant, the absolutely unexpected and unexpectable arrival, orwhat I call the strange stranger, the stranger whose strangeness is foreverstrange—it cannot be tamed or rationalized away. This stranger is not sounfamiliar: uncanny familiarity is one of the strange stranger’s traits. Onlyconsider anyone who has a long-term partner: the person they wake up with everyday is the strangest person they know. The future future and the strangestranger are the weird and unpredictable entities that honest ecologicalthinking compels us to think about. When we can see that far into the future andthat far around Earth, a curious blindness afflicts us, a blindness far moremysterious than simple lack of sight, since we can precisely see so much morethan ever. This blindness is a symptom of an already existing intimacy with alllifeforms, knowledge of which is now thrust on us whether we like it or not.Parfit’s assault on utilitarian self-interest takes us to the point at which werealize that we are not separate from our world. Humans must learn to care forfatal substances that will outlast them and their descendants beyond anymeaningful limit of self-interest. What we need is an ethics of the other, anethics based on the proximity of the stranger. The decision in the 1990s,rapidly overturned, to squirrel plutonium away into knives and forks and otherdomestic objects appears monstrous, and so would any attempt to “work” it intosomething convenient. Hyperobjects insist that we care for them in the open.“Out of sight, out of mind” is strictly untenable. There is no “away” to throwplutonium in. We are stuck with it, in the same way as we are stuck with ourbiological bodies. Plutonium finds itself in the position of the “neighbor” inAbrahamic religions—that awkward condition of being alien and intimate at thevery same time.The enormity of very large finitude hollows out my decisions from the inside.Now every time I so much as change a confounded light bulb, I have to thinkabout global warming. It is the end of the world, because I can see past the lipof the horizon of human worlding. Global warming reaches into “my world” andforces me to use LEDs instead of bulbs with filaments. This aspect of theHeideggerian legacy begins to teeter under the weight of the hyperobject. Thenormative defense of worlds looks wrongheaded.39 The ethical and politicalchoices become much clearer and less divisive if we begin to think of pollutionand global warming and radiation as effects of hyperobjects rather than as flowsor processes that can be managed. These flows are often eventually shunted intosome less powerful group’s backyard. The Native American tribe must deal withthe radioactive waste. The African American family must deal with the toxicchemical runoff. The Nigerian village must deal with the oil slick. Rob Nixoncalls this the slow violence of ecological oppression.40 It is helpful to thinkof global warming as something like an ultra slow motion nuclear bomb. Theincremental effects are almost invisible, until an island disappears underwater.Poor people—who include most of us on Earth at this point—perceive theecological emergency not as degrading an aesthetic picture such as world but asan accumulation of violence that nibbles at them directly.Without a world, there are simply a number of unique beings (farmers, dogs,irises, pencils, LEDs, and so on) to whom I owe an obligation through the simplefact that existence is coexistence. I don’t have to run through my worldingchecklist to ensure that the nonhuman in question counts as something I couldcare for. “If you answered mostly (A), then you have a world. If you answeredmostly (B), then you are poor in world (German, weltarm). If you answered mostly(C), then you have no world whatsoever.” What remains without a world isintimacy. Levinas touches on it in his ethics of alterity, although he isincorrect to make this otherness as vague as the “rustling” of blank existence,the “there is” (il y a).41 The other is fully here, before I am, as Levinasargues. But the other has paws and sharp surfaces, the other is decorated withleaves, the other shines with starlight. Kafka writes:At first glance it looks like a flat star-shaped spool for thread, and indeed itdoes seem to have thread wound upon it; to be sure, they are only old,broken-off bits of thread, knotted and tangled together, of the most variedsorts and colors. But it is not only a spool, for a small wooden crossbar sticksout of the middle of the star, and another small rod is joined to that at aright angle. By means of this latter rod on one side and one of the points ofthe star on the other, the whole thing can stand upright as if on two legs.42“The idea that he is likely to survive me I find almost painful.”43 Kafka’sOdradek resembles the hyperobject in this respect. Indeed we have let him intoour home somehow, like mercury and microwaves, like the ultraviolet rays of theSun. Odradek is what confronts us at the end of the world, not with a shout butwith a breathless voice “like the rustling of fallen leaves.”44 Things appear intheir disturbing weakness and lameness, technical terms describing the humanattunement to hyperobjects that I have begun to elucidate.Without a world, there is no Nature. Without a world, there is no life. Whatexists outside the charmed circles of Nature and life is a charnel ground, aplace of life and death, of death-in-life and life-in-death, an undead place ofzombies, viroids, junk DNA, ghosts, silicates, cyanide, radiation, demonicforces, and pollution. My resistance to ecological awareness is a resistance tothe charnel ground. It is the calling of the shaman to enter the charnel groundand to try to stay there, to pitch a tent there and live there, for as long aspossible. Since there are no charnel grounds to speak of in the West, the bestanalogy, used by some Tibetan Buddhists (from whom the image derives), is theemergency room of a busy hospital. People are dying everywhere. There is bloodand noise, equipment rushing around, screams. When the charm of world isdispelled, we find ourselves in the emergency room of ecological coexistence.In the charnel ground, worlds can never take root. Charnel grounds are too vividfor that. Any soft focusing begins to look like violence. Haunting a charnelground is a much better analogy for ecological coexistence than inhabiting aworld. There is something immensely soothing about charnel grounds. It is whatis soothing about Buddhism’s First Noble Truth, the truth of suffering.Traditionally, Buddhism recognizes three types of suffering. There is the painof pain, as when you hit your thumb with a hammer, and then you close your wholehand in the door as you rush into the car to get to the doctor’s because of yourthumb. Then there is the pain of alteration, in which you experience firstpleasure, then pain when pleasure evaporates. Then there is “all-pervasivepain,” which Chögyam Trungpa beautifully describes as a “fundamental creepyquality” akin to Heidegger’s description of Angst.45 It is this quality thatcomes close to the notion of world. All-pervasive pain has to do with thefixation and confusion that constitute the Six Realms of Existence(traditionally, animals, humans, gods, jealous gods, hungry ghosts, and hell).In paintings of the Wheel of Life, the Six Realms are held in the jaws of Yama,the Lord of Death.It is this outermost perspective of the jaws of death that provides an entrypoint into the charnel ground. To a Buddhist, ecophenomenological arguments thatbase ethics on our embeddedness in a lifeworld begin to look like a perverseaestheticization, celebrations of confusion and suffering for confusion’s andsuffering’s sake. It doesn’t really matter what is on the TV (murder, addiction,fear, lust). Each realm of existence is just a TV show taking up “space” in thewider space of the charnel ground of reality, “the desert of the real.”46 TrebbeJohnson and others have established the practice of Global Earth Exchanges,actions of finding, then giving something beautiful in a “wounded place,” suchas a toxic dump or a nuclear power facility.47 Or consider Buddhistpractitioners of tonglen: “sending and taking,” a meditation practice in whichone breathes out compassion for the other, while breathing in her or hissuffering. Tonglen is now used in the context of polluted places. Consider Chöd,the esoteric ritual of visualizing cutting oneself up as a feast for the demons,another practice that has been taken on with reference to ecologicalcatastrophes. Or consider the activities of Zen priests at the Rocky Flatsnuclear bomb trigger factory, such as walking meditation. Our actions build up akarmic pattern that looks from a reified distance like a realm such as hell orheaven. But beyond the violence that we do, it’s the distance that reifies thepattern into a world picture that needs to be shattered. Whether it’s Hobbiton,or the jungles of Avatar, or the National Parks and conservation areas overyonder on the hither side of the screen (though possibly behind the windshieldof an SUV), or the fields and irrigation channels on the hither side of thewilderness—it’s all a world picture. I’m not saying we need to uproot thetrees—I’m saying that we need to smash the aestheticization: in case ofecological emergency, break glass.Our increasing knowledge of global warming ends all kinds of ideas, but itcreates other ones. The essence of these new ideas is the notion ofcoexistence—that is after all what ecology profoundly means. We coexist withhuman lifeforms, nonhuman lifeforms, and non-lifeforms, on the insides of aseries of gigantic entities with whom we also coexist: the ecosystem, biosphere,climate, planet, solar system. A multiple series of nested Russian dolls. Whaleswithin whales within whales.Consider the hypothetical planet Tyche, far out in the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto.We can’t see it directly but we can detect evidence of its possible existence.Planets are hyperobjects in most senses. They have Gaussian geometry andmeasurable space-time distortion because they are so massive. They affecteverything that exists on and in them. They’re “everywhere and nowhere” up close(viscosity). (Point to Earth right now—you have a number of options of where topoint.) They are really old and really huge compared with humans. And there’ssomething disturbing about the existence of a planet that far away, perhaps noteven of “our” solar system originally, yet close enough to be uncanny (a verylarge finitude). And it’s unseen except for its hypothetical influence onobjects such as comets: “The awful shadow of some unseen power,” in Shelley’swords. Tyche is a good name. It means “contingency” in Greek, so it’s thespeculative realism planet par excellence. (“Luck” and “chance” are rather tamealternative translations. Tyche is what happens to you in a tragedy if your nameis Oedipus.) And for now, what could be more obviously withdrawn?The historic moment at which hyperobjects become visible by humans has arrived.This visibility changes everything. Humans enter a new age of sincerity, whichcontains an intrinsic irony that is beyond the aestheticized, slightly plasticirony of the postmodern age. What do I mean?This is a momentous era, at which we achieve what has sometimes been calledecological awareness. Ecological awareness is a detailed and increasing sense,in science and outside of it, of the innumerable interrelationships amonglifeforms and between life and non-life. Now this awareness has some verystrange properties. First of all, the awareness ends the idea that we are livingin an environment! This is so bizarre that we should dwell on it a little. Whatit means is that the more we know about the interconnection, the more it becomesimpossible to posit some entity existing beyond or behind the interrelatedbeings. When we look for the environment, what we find are discrete lifeforms,non-life, and their relationships. But no matter how hard we look, we won’t finda container in which they all fit; in particular we won’t find an umbrella thatunifies them, such as world, environment, ecosystem, or even, astonishingly,Earth.What we discover instead is an open-ended mesh that consists of grass, iron ore,Popsicles, sunlight, the galaxy Sagittarius, and mushroom spores. Earth exists,no doubt, but not as some special enormous bowl that contains all the“ecological” objects. Earth is one object coexisting with mice, sugar,elephants, and Turin. Of course there are many scenarios in which if Earthceased to exist, Turin and mice would be in trouble. But if the mice were shotinto space aboard a friendly extraterrestrial freighter, Earth wouldn’t be thecause of their death. Even Turin might be rebuilt, brick by brick, on some otherworld.Suddenly we discover the second astonishing thing. Mice are surely mice nomatter what we call them. But mice remain mice as long as they survive to passon their genome—it’s what neo-Darwinism calls satisficing. Satisficing is aperformative standard for existing. And there is no mouse-flavored DNA. Thereisn’t even any DNA-flavored DNA—it’s a palimpsest of mutations, viral codeinsertions, and so on. There isn’t even any life-flavored life. DNA requiresribosomes and ribosomes require DNA, so to break the vicious cycle, there musthave been an RNA world of RNA attached to a nonorganic replicator, such as asilicate crystal. So there is a mouse—this is not a nominalist nor is it anidealist argument. But the mouse is a nonmouse, or what I call a strangestranger.48 Even more weirdly: this is why the mouse is real. The fact thatwherever we look, we can’t find a mouse, is the very reason why she exists! Nowwe can say this about everything in the universe. But one of the most obviousthings we can say this about is a hyperobject. Hyperobjects are so huge and solong-lasting, compared with humans, that they obviously seem both vivid andslightly unreal, for exactly the same reasons.Hyperobjects such as global warming and nuclear radiation surround us, not someabstract entity such as Nature or environment or world. Our reality has becomemore real, in the sense of more vivid and intense, and yet it has also becomeless knowable as some one-sided, facile thing—again, for exactly the samereasons. In Berkeley, California, in early 2011, radiation levels in waterspiked 181 times higher than normal because of the Sendai reactor meltdowns. Weknow this. We know we are bathed in alpha, beta, and gamma rays emanating fromthe dust particles that now span the globe. These particles coexist with us.They are not part of some enormous bowl called Nature; they are beings like us,strange strangers.Should we stop drinking water? Should we stop drinking cow’s milk because cowseat grass, which drinks rainwater? The more we know, the harder it is to make aone-sided decision about anything. As we enter the time of hyperobjects, Naturedisappears and all the modern certainties that seemed to accompany it. Whatremains is a vastly more complex situation that is uncanny and intimate at thesame time.There is no exit from this situation. Thus the time of hyperobjects is a time ofsincerity: a time in which it is impossible to achieve a final distance towardthe world. But for this very reason, it is also a time of irony. We realize thatnonhuman entities exist that are incomparably more vast and powerful than weare, and that our reality is caught in them. What things are and how they seem,and how we know them, is full of gaps, yet vividly real. Real entities containtime and space, exhibiting nonlocal effects and other interobjective phenomena,writing us into their histories. Astonishingly, then, the mesh ofinterconnection is secondary to the strange stranger. The mesh is an emergentproperty of the things that coexist, and not the other way around. For themodernist mind, accustomed to systems and structures, this is an astounding,shocking discovery. The more maps we make, the more real things tear throughthem. Nonhuman entities emerge through our mapping, then they destroy them.Coexistence is in our face: it is our face. We are made of nonhuman andnonsentient and nonliving entities. It’s not a cozy situation: it’s a spooky,uncanny situation. We find ourselves in what robotics and CGI designers call theuncanny valley (Figure 2 [Gros_9781583948989_epub_c28_r1.htm#fig0021]). It’s acommonly known phenomenon in CGI design that if you build figures that look toomuch like humans, you are at risk of crossing a threshold and falling into theuncanny valley. In the uncanny valley, beings are strangely familiar andfamiliarly strange. The valley seems to explain racism quite well, because thedehumanization suffered by victims of racism makes them more uncanny to theracist than, say, a dog or a faceless robot. Hitler was very fond of his dogBlondi and yet dehumanized Jews and others. That’s the trouble with some kindsof environmentalist language: they skip blithely over the uncanny valley toshake hands with beings on the other side. But, as I’m going to argue, there isonly another side if you are holding on to some fictional idea of humanness, anidea that ecological awareness actually refutes. The uncanny valley, in otherwords, is only a valley if you already have some quite racist assumptions aboutlifeforms.[images/Gros_9781583948989_epub_043_r1.jpg]Figure 2. Masahiro Mori’s diagram of the uncanny valley. Intimacy implies thegrotesque. Since ecological awareness consists in a greater intimacy with agreater number of beings than modernity is capable of thinking, humans must passthrough the uncanny valley as they begin to engage these beings. For reasonsgiven in the book, this valley might be infinite in extent.With ecological awareness there is no “healthy person” on the other side of thevalley. Everything in your world starts to slip into the uncanny valley, whosesides are infinite and slick. It’s more like an uncanny charnel ground, an ERfull of living and dying and dead and newly born people, some of whom arehumans, some of whom aren’t, some of whom are living, some of whom aren’t.Everything in your world starts to slip into this charnel ground situation,including your world.Isn’t it strange that we can admire comets, black holes, and suns—entities thatwould destroy us if they came within a few miles of us—and we can’t get a handleon global warming? Isn’t global climate now in the uncanny valley? Doesn’t thishave something to do with art? Because when you look at the stars and imaginelife on other planets, you are looking through the spherical glass screen of theatmosphere at objects that appear to be behind that glass screen—for all thedevelopments since Ptolemy, in other words, you still imagine that we exist onthe inside of some pristine glass sphere. The experience of cosmic wonder is anaesthetic experience, a three-dimensional surround version of looking at apicturesque painting in an art gallery. So Jane Taylor’s Romantic period poem“The Star” is about seeing stars through the atmosphere, in which they seem to“Twinkle, twinkle.”Two and a half thousand people showed up at the University of Arizona in Tucsonfor a series of talks on cosmology.49 Evidently there is a thirst for thinkingabout the universe as a whole. Why is the same fascination not there for globalwarming? It’s because of the oppressive claustrophobic horror of actually beinginside it. You can spectate “the universe” as an ersatz aesthetic object: youhave the distance provided by the biosphere itself, which acts as a sphericalcinema screen. Habit tells us that what’s displayed on that screen (likeprojections in a planetarium) is infinite, distant—the whole Kantian sublime.But inside the belly of the whale that is global warming, it’s oppressive andhot and there’s no “away” anymore. And it’s profoundly regressing: a toxicintrauterine experience, on top of which we must assume responsibility for it.And what neonatal or prenatal infant should be responsible for her mother’sexistence? Global warming is in the uncanny valley, as far as hyperobjects go.Maybe a black hole, despite its terrifying horror, is so far away and sowondrous and so fatal (we would simply cease to exist anywhere near it) that wemarvel at it, rather than try to avoid thinking about it or feel grief about it.The much smaller, much more immediately dangerous hole that we’re in (inside thehyperobject global warming) is profoundly disturbing, especially because wecreated it.Now the trouble with global warming is that it’s right here. It’s not behind aglass screen. It is that glass screen, but it’s as if the glass screen starts toextrude itself toward you in a highly uncanny, scary way that violates thenormal aesthetic propriety, which we know about from philosophers such asKant—the propriety in which there should be a Goldilocks distance between youand the art object, not too close, not too far away. Global warming plays a verymean trick. It comes very, very close, crashing onto our beaches and forcing usto have cabinet meetings underwater to draw attention to our plight, and yetwithdrawing from our grasp in the very same gesture, so that we can onlyrepresent it by using computers with tremendous processing speed.50 The whalethat Jonah is inside is a higherdimensional being than ourselves, liketwo-dimensional stick people relative to a three-dimensional apple. We see thatwe are weak, in the precise sense that our discourse and maps and plansregarding things are not those things. There is an irreducible gap.Spookily, the picture frame starts to melt and extrude itself toward us, itstarts to burn our clothing. This is not what we paid twelve bucks to see whenwe entered the art gallery. Human art, in the face of this melting glass screen,is in no sense public relations. It has to actually be a science, part ofscience, part of cognitively mapping this thing. Art has to be part of the glassitself because everything inside the biosphere is touched by global warming.Notes1.

It is parallelMemphis, where MLK was shot and the dream became a nightmare.In astrological parlance, being discovered on February 18, 1930 would make it anAquarian planet and, thus, its influence would extend beyond its mere mundane orcommon mythological meaning. Pluto would be forever tied to the death of cultureand, since it was at 17 degrees Cancer, just 4 degrees off the USA Natal chartat 13, it will forever be linked to the land of Manifest Destiny.Pluto, the planet of Scorpio, harbinger of life, death and rebirth, would beproviding the kindling for the eventual immolation of the West.But that’s not really what I want to write about, although mine is an Americanstory, as American as Pluto.I lived with Pluto—he was my father.My father was born five years after the discovery of that dark and icy orb. Hewas born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was Steinbeck-worthy. His family was likethat of many Dust Bowl immigrants who fled to the sunny state of California,where his mother would divorce his own alcoholic father and throw my father intoa cyclonic downdraft of foster homes, rejection, and ultimately, neglect.He grew up as a raging fury, fighting whenever anyone crossed eyes with him.He left school early and enrolled in the Army.His was given a dishonorable discharge after six months.He drifted, fought some more, and then realized, in true Plutonian fashion, thathe needed to re-enlist and complete the Plutonian/Phoenix cycle. He became amodel soldier, read the classics, learned some judo, and met my mother at anArmy base dance.My father had Mars and Jupiter in Scorpio, whose ruling planet is Pluto.My first taste of Pluto was when I was around four and witnessed him knockingout my grandfather and my uncle in a drunken fistfight on a hot New Jerseynight.I was shuttled to a neighbor’s house around midnight. We left New Jersey shortlythereafter.The flight of the Phoenix across America took us to San Bruno, or Saint Bruno,the Catholic icon whose claim to fame was the eloquence he displayed in funeralrites and eulogies, which is a very Plutonic gift indeed, bestowing poeticblessings upon the newly dead.Saint Bruno was canonized on February 17, 1623. That would be just one calendarday before Pluto was discovered on February 18.San Bruno was the entry point to my journey into Hades. Say your prayers, ohsainted one—for the annihilation of my tender psyche was about to commence.For the next ten years of my life, I would watch my father literally leave hisbody and become someone else, something else, and unleash the fury of hell. Heknew it too, and there was nothing he could do about it. The neglect andrejection that he experienced as a child had been locked away in his Plutoniandepths and could no longer be contained.The relatively safe, if improper, alchemy of the home was the place where adamned transmutation could occur at a moment’s notice. The domestic alembicbecame a Plutonic cauldron.Astrologically his Mars in Scorpio was opposite his mother’s Taurus Sun in afixed alignment. For years, the shame that his mother felt about divorcing hisfather would be projected onto my father. Stubborn as a bull, only when she wasabout to receive Pluto’s kiss on her deathbed would she openly confess love formy father. The raging fires of Scorpio would finally be doused by the vapors ofher final breaths.In my own astrological chart I have Pluto conjunct my Mid Heaven, I am a Scorpiorising and have Mars in my Eighth House. His Scorpio Mars was in my TwelfthHouse and, if you know anything about astrology, it is the most violent aspectof Mars in a chart: astrologers often call it “the placement of hidden enemies.”Over time, I learned to determine the tenor, timbre, and overall mood of thesituation, testing the emotional atmosphere around me, sensing whether or notHades would make a guest appearance. It helped me hone my instincts and psychicawareness in such a way that I could walk into a room and read whom was a threator not. I could sense who had power and, later on psychic and intuitive levels.I could derive more subtle details. What was a bare survival skill at hometurned into a useful tool in the world at large. Hypervigilance morphed intopsychic awareness.I began to learn how to live with both violence and intensity and extremeconditions because when my father was right, he was one of the best guys on theplanet but, when he wasn’t, he was sheer hell.Astrologically, that’s an aspect of Pluto as well, the light and dark, with nomiddle ground. The light switch was either on or off. The gray area was my ownworld, trying to make sense of the extremes.Later in life, I realized that I was being put through some type of initiationduring those formative years. I was experiencing things that no child shouldhave to and yet I had come to realize by trial that I had a capacity to handledark psychic material that would make most people blanch.I could hold space for crisis, conspiracy, and catastrophe that set me apartfrom others who were raised under more “normal” circumstances.However this too was distorted in some ways as my choices for partners wouldalso have some Plutonian current running through their lives. I once dated abruja who had been a morphine addict and lived an almost vampire-like existencein a dark hovel at the fringe of San Francisco’s Mission District.I was drawn to Persephone archetypes that would lead me back down into theunderworld that had been my psychic stomping grounds, my personal familiar hell.I would spend plenty of lost time in these places, exorcizing his demons and nowmine.What I learned was that the devils that rose up from my father’s Plutoniandepths were in some ways my teachers, the guides of hidden and desperate spaces,unspoken epiphanies, and quarters of the dark side. They were once and futuregatekeepers of the shadow realm. Their shape-changing presence would continue ona personal and professional level as a theme in my life.My father was an unconscious shaman of sorts, leading me into a lifelongexploration of the underworld and psychic depth.In his honor, I want to share a positively Plutonian experience before anyonewho reads this gets the impression that I lived with (Scorpio) Charlie Manson’sdoppelganger.One day, I was at school and I got into a hassle with a kid in line and as aresult, he wanted to, “call me out” as we used to say back in the day. I agreedand we were going to fight after school.Well, my heart wasn’t in it and I deftly avoided him. But he went to my houseand asked my father if I was there. My father asked him why. He told him that wewere supposed to meet after school and fight.When I got home, my father asked me about him and if it was true. He also askedme if I was scared. I told him, “Yes.” He then told me to tell him that I wouldfight him in two weeks.The next day at school, I did. I told him.For the following two weeks, my father trained me in the darkness of oursuburban garage. He strung up a heavy duffle filed with clothes, which becameour training bag. He put up a speed bag too and taught me how to hit it. Weskipped rope, practiced combinations, and lifted weights. Here was his Mars inScorpio as an ally, not the tempestuous and hidden enemy stalking me in thehidden spaces of my twelfth house. In the dark square, upon slab concrete, Plutoassumed form as my own, personal trainer.Two weeks later, I walked over to my adversary’s house on a cul-de-sac, a deadend, a Plutonian semi-circle of sorts.I knocked on his door and his mother answered.“Are you here to fight David?”Clearly she was in on the deal. “Yes, I am,” I said, being in on the deal too.David strode out of the house, barrel-chested with bravado, and met me in thecenter of Pluto’s cul-de-sac.He wasn’t ready for the ninth planet. I put on a boxing clinic, moving andjabbing, sticking and feinting. It wasn’t a fair fight. I dodged his clumsyhaymakers as if they were being thrown in slow motion. I didn’t so much beat himup as humiliate him. Out of frustration he started to kick me, and his mother,ever the overseer, the Moon, watching it all from her window, came out andstopped the fight.She said, “Your father taught you how to fight, didn’t he?”I didn’t know what she was getting at, but my Pluto must have known the entireact because I said, “Yes, but he also taught me how to make friend afterwards.”I stuck out my hand to shake David’s. He reciprocated and the two went backinside.A month later, they moved.So you see, Pluto is complex, multi-layered, and relentless from an astrologicalperspective. It’s not for novices or first-timers. It’s for those of us who arelikely not going to change in any other way, who won’t budge unless we areconfronted by the intensity, violence, and potential for rebirth seminal in themoments of utter darkness.I would not be who I am today, for better or worse, without Pluto, Pluto in mychart and Pluto in the guise of my Dad, and I love him for it. Father might haveknown best, but perhaps Pluto knew better."},{"pageContent":"30........PLUTO IS THE REASON WE HAVE A CHANCEAn Interview*ELLIAS LONSDALEPluto is literally dropped into the deepest layers of consciousness into whichwe are capable of dropping, that we can conceive of, that we can imagine, towhich we can penetrate, that we can actually probe. For most people most of thetime, Pluto is unconscious, yet compulsive. It comes out of nowhere; they don’tknow what it is, they don’t work with it very well. But if you happen to be adepth-charged soul, Pluto is the greatest of allies because it gives youcoordinates to the underworld, to inner worlds, to other worlds. It provides ajourney to take. It gives you core resonance, a kind of radical evolutionarypath, which is different for every being, every person.Pluto has a tendency to be overwhelming and yet perfect. Its perfection issomething you discover late in the game, but its overwhelmingness is somethingyou’re with all the time.I would say that it is because of Pluto that we have a chance. Every otherplanet, relatively speaking, even Neptune, is superficial, is surfacy, isplugged into programs and conditionings, habits and syndromes of memory. Plutois able to pierce the veil, every veil, including the veil of collectiveconsciousness and the way we usually think about things, the way we usuallyoperate, which is asleep, tuned-out, absent, missing. Pluto is what brings ushere, brings us through; it is overwhelmingly the one planet you can depend on.You can depend that Pluto will show up. It will do stuff. It won’t be among themissing, it won’t be vague, it won’t be nebulous.My sense of it is that if people were fully aware of what Pluto is doing, theywould treat it like the devil, they would treat it as something to exorcize orget rid of, to avoid or run from, because it defies logic, it contradicts ourway of life. Pluto forces us to surrender, to let go, to enter a differentexistence, to learn about things, remember things, realize things, accept thingsthat we typically prefer to avoid.Pluto is more experiential than even your most powerful and poignantexperiences. It tells you that have to be there, you have to earn it, you haveto earn your existence. You have to be absolutely in it and through it. Youcannot talk it, you cannot fake it, and you certainly cannot capitalize on it.Because it knows all that, because it is the fact of that, Pluto is the ultimateequalizer.Pluto is the best place to begin the infinite journey, for it will kill off anyego-complexes you happen to still observe. It will keep you honest and make youlearn the ways of the Earth. When the Earth is taken as a cosmos, as a totalsystem, it becomes Pluto’s special province, special concern, special interest,because living in the Earth is reincarnational, is physical, is thefully-embodied reality, potentially, that Pluto is trying to facilitate and workus into and through. In that sense, Earth is Pluto, and Pluto is Earth. Earth isthe depth of Pluto, and Pluto is the mystery of Earth.Where astrology and astronomy meet, Pluto is a kind of an abyss, a void-space,almost like a black-hole kind of place that’s at the center of a vast otherrealm. It’s the king and the focal point of that realm but utterly elusive ineveryday systems and circumstances. You’d really have to keep digging anddigging, probing and probing, penetrating and excavating to get at it.*.

They should be heard aloud as speech."},{"pageContent":"31......PLUTO: PLANET OF WEALTHAn Interview*ROB BREZSNYWhen I talk about Pluto, I’m not picturing a god, I’m not picturing a man—I’mpicturing a realm. The god Pluto can stand in and be symbolic for a place. Theplace is known by many names: the Underworld, the astral plane, the fourthdimension. I call it the other real world—that’s one name I have for it. It’s auniverse ruled as much by Persephone as Pluto. In fact, for me, Persephoneprecedes Pluto. The Persephone-Pluto dyad is archetypally symbolic of a wholesphere of topography and being. So when I ask myself, “What is the influence of,or what is the meaning, astrologically, of the planet Pluto?” I automaticallyadd, “What is the meaning of the planet Pluto/Persephone?”Before there was a masculine god Pluto in ancient mythology, before he governeda subterranean realm, Persephone was its sole ruler. Only a later patriarchalgloss enthroned Pluto there, but his deposing of Persephone required a violentact of rape and kidnapping, which is how that she got taken below. Thepatriarchal version of the myth is indicative of the longstanding subversivenature of Pluto: Pluto wouldn’t be the Underworld or Hades without an interloperdragging Persephone there. But the Pluto/Persephone archetype transcends any oneversion of the Pluto/Persephone myth. In other words I am talking about a deep,hidden force that manifests throughout the universe on different worlds indifferent times and is always seminal. You can’t have Pluto without Persephone,but you also can’t have Persephone unless Pluto awaits her.For me, living in the Plutonian realm is a key part of being human. You need todwell at two levels: the surface, which is the domain of the ego, of transientwealth and shiny material things, and the Underworld or what the Qabala callsFoundation or Yesod. I don’t mean to suggest that ego experiences are lesser orshould be devalued as such. It’s just that they have become grosslyoverexaggerated and overemphasized in our culture. As an advocate for the realmof the soul, I am always overcompensating on its behalf. A healthy human beingmust be able to go back and forth between the two realms and acquire both sortsof experiences and knowledge. As is, no matter how ego-based our culture, wehave to spend at least seven or eight hours every day in the Underworld. Therewe meet Persephone, in sleep and in dream, as we go back to the Foundation, toour source, and dwell there for a spell.I first began noticing and paying attention to Pluto around age thirteen, thoughnot by name, as I started remembering and writing down my dreams. I recognizedmy need for a vital connection with the Underworld, and four years later Ibecame a feminist and goddess-worshipper. I was seeking modes of intelligencethat weren’t being taught at school.Unfortunately, our modern culture is more and more ignoring, denying,repressing, banishing Pluto. This is particularly obvious in the rise of machineconsciousness: we are being infected by a mechanistic way of being, thinking,and feeling. In our overly logical and rational minds, technology has become thesole viable or authorized mode of intelligence. At the same time, the realm ofthe soul—the way in which our organism functions as soul—is increasinglydemeaned and diminished. The loss is immeasurable, for the soul is essential toour survival.Don’t get me wrong: the scientific rubric is of great value; it’s an importantmode, powerful and beautiful in its way. But a pathology develops when it’s theonly mode recognized as important or valid, when nothing else is really real andnothing else needs to be nourished, nothing else leaves its imprint on ourexistence. When we try to live as machines or the familiars of machines, evenour emotional lives become mechanistic.Symbolically this situation is illustrated by the 2006 demotion of Pluto fromplanetary status. Scientists no doubt had sound, rational reasons to exile Plutofrom the traditional Solar System and transfer its realm to the Kuiper Belt withthe other dwarf worlds, but they were also under the influence of deeplyunconscious forces too. The expulsion of Pluto marked a symbolic turning pointin the triumphalism and triumph of scientism, the ascendency of a mode ofthinking that values only what’s visible, measurable, and categorizable. ButPluto is more than the rocky planetoid representing it: Pluto is an essentialphase of human consciousness.It is no accident that ostracism comes at a time when the Plutonian realm itselfis being devalued and rendered inessential. The overall downgrading of Pluto isa milestone in the modern attempt to depreciate the soul’s mode of awareness andmake it subsidiary to the deductive mind. To banish Pluto is to deny that livingin the soul has any value to us.Though Pluto of course existed before its discovery by astronomers in 1930, 1930was the year in which its archetype came into our awareness. I wonder if thereis something that the first appearance of Pluto in the conscious realmcorresponded to in the Underworld from which it came. A culture bent on denyingthe Underworld’s existence inherits the Underworld’s chaos and pandemoniuminstead. In this case the forces leading World War II gathered as a new planetentered the zodiac.But Pluto appeared when we needed it. Many Plutonian phenomena and influences inastrological charts can be traced to the ways in which we require Pluto butaren’t getting it. The harder that atheistic science practitioners try to scourall evidence of the Underworld, the more Pluto’s effects are going to manifestin bizarre and violent forms. They appear, like Pluto, because they are there.We have plenty of examples of negative Pluto. Religious fundamentalism,climate-change denial, accumulations of obscene amounts of wealth by the alreadywealthy are among the pathological emanations of Pluto, the result of its realmbeing suppressed. Financial instruments that are developed solely to createmonetary value at the expense of labor and creativity elevate individuals whohaven’t earned their assets and have no idea of what to do with them except tocreate more. Bernie Madoff was a classic example of Plutonian madness: healready had enough money for three lifetimes when he committed the crimes thatgot him imprisoned in a Hades-like cell.But Pluto is neither the transgression nor its jailer; it is the sash thatoscillates back and forth between the insanity of ego-derived andfactorygenerated, media-hyped wealth and the depth of soul wealth. Plutoniantreasures are often the antitheses of economic value and lead to the alchemicaltransformation of money and assets into a different, more organic currency thatthe soul can actually assimilate and use.July 2015, when NASA’s New Horizons satellite will arrive at the outermostoriginal planet, marks the final transit of the big Pluto-Uranus square that hasbeen unwinding since 2009. By 2015 it will have taken place six or seven times.Some astrologers attribute the financial collapse of 2008 to the directinfluence of that square. That is also why they worry that there’s still moreturmoil to come: the tension between Pluto and Uranus hasn’t completelyclimaxed.The trickster is a crucial element of our historic engagement with the Plutoarchetype because it goes back and forth between conscious and unconsciousrealms with ease. Practitioners of scientism and the sciences don’t like thetrickster because it messes with boundaries, it dissolves definitions, it makesit hard to tell what’s real and what’s not. But the trickster is going to showup whether atheistic science practitioners want him or not, and increasinglyhe’s creating a jumble of ideas and phenomena that leave scientists completelyconfused and enraged. Lately they have been as outraged about homeopathy,probiotics, and UFOs as their foes have been about claims of melting glaciers,the biology of gender, and evolution. Pluto’s trickster universe is becoming onebig maddening, irrational soup for mainstream science. Yet to the degree thatthey keep banishing Pluto, the trickster is going to get bigger and bigger andbigger, in bizarre and cartoony ways too.The modern world doesn’t just try to convince us that the soul doesn’t exist.Convincing us is the single purpose of modernity. We want to conquer Pluto’sshadow world and get it away from trickster deeds and signs. We want to pretendthat Pluto doesn’t exist or, if it does, that it is not important enough to begranted a kingdom.But it’s really the soul that is being banished, that’s on a trail of tearsheaded out to some backland, some faraway place—it doesn’t actually matter whereas long as it won’t bother us anymore, as long as it won’t insert its crazywisdom into our conversations, as long as it won’t get in the way of ourhoarding false wealth and putting the universe into privately-owned boxes andcubicles.The modern reaffirmation of the classical myth of Pluto merely ratifies thecanard or slander about Pluto—that we can only go down to its territory by rapeand abduction, that only through an act of violence and violation can we get ourexperience of the Underworld, of the soul’s realm. The soul, which is said notto exist, is allowed back only by trespass and transgression. That is Pluto’snew, unspoken myth.But of course if we deny, banish, and repress all the soul’s good stuff, theonly way it can reach us is through rape and abduction. As its cycle of violenceand prurience increases, Pluto imposes a daily punishment, which is not actuallya punishment but a necessity, a gift in disguise. The soul will not allow us toforget it, even if it has to express itself by dark acts of requital. Pluto’srevenge is the revenge of a world that’s being denied. People are taken to theirravaged and forgotten souls by acts of mutilation and pornography. So we end uprelating to Pluto through violent means rather than by daily familiarity andengagement with the archetype itself or by becoming aware of the soul’s radiancein quiet, inconspicuous, mundane ways.The soul is the root of this world; that’s what shamans in every cultureprofess. That’s where they go to find healing that will repair the body in thisworld. The Qabalists tell us that Yesod is the origin and foundation of thisplane of creation. Paul Foster Case’s pattern on the Trestleboard is an homageand prayer to Pluto:0. All the Power that ever was or will be is here now.1. I am a center of expression for the Primal Will-to-Good which eternallycreates and sustains the Universe.2. Through me its unfailing Wisdom takes form in thought and word.3. Filled with Understanding of its perfect law, I am guided, moment by moment,along the path of liberation.4. From the exhaustless riches of its Limitless Substance, I draw all thingsneedful, both spiritual and material.5. I recognize the manifestation of the Undeviating Justice in all thecircumstances of my life.6. In all things, great and small, I see the Beauty of the Divine Expression.7. Living from that Will, supported by its unfailing Wisdom and Understanding,mine is the Victorious Life.8. I look forward with confidence to the perfect realization of the EternalSplendor of the Limitless Light.9. In thought and word and deed, I rest my life, from day to day, upon the sureFoundation of Eternal Being.10. The Kingdom of Spirit is embodied in my flesh.Pluto, the soul, Yesod abide; they’re there in every single moment—as treasure,as possibility. And to the degree to which we ignore them and don’t look forthem and only value things in the material world, to that degree we build up thenecessity for Plutonian shocks; for rapes, abductions, and seizures; for eventsthat force us to go down and look at what’s beneath, what’s in the core of ourbeing, what’s below us at the roots of this world.When Thomas Moore and James Hillman talked about soul work, what they meant waslittle acts of unions with the underneath part of the world. It is alwaysshowing through if we’ll just look for it. Not spectacular actions, ecstaticdances at a Burning Man event, though that’s fine. Or some crazy Tantric fuck,which is fine too. I have nothing against those Pluto manifestations. Or Godforbid, disease and death—that’s another sure way of getting to Pluto.You might recall that the designer L’Wren Scott, Mick Jagger’s girlfriend,committed suicide in early 2014. My wife Roe and I looked at her chart and sawthat Pluto was transiting over her Sun, right on her Sun in fact. The consensusseems to be that she committed suicide because, in large part, she was a failurefinancially, deep in debt.I don’t want to speculate at her expense, but this may have been a classicPlutonian suicide—a rush, a sudden appearance, of the soul that could not betolerated because it was too strange and horrific and empty. The realm in whichthis woman was admired and achieved an identity as a designer of pretty thingsthat cost a good deal of money was something that her ego could no longersustain. It didn’t match what was really happening in her soul.The emotional breakdown was an invitation for her, and again I speculate, to godown below and find another way to value herself; she didn’t have to be only adesigner of pretty clothes for the wealthy; she could become something morereal.But she couldn’t handle the invitation. She didn’t want to deal with the loss ofthis other kind of wealth, the ego’s wealth. She refused Pluto’s invitation toexperience the different wealth of the Underworld.When people only derive riches through material objects, power, money, what theego values, they are sending an irresistible invitation for Pluto to bring themdown.We can cultivate a more ordinary Plutonian ritual and mantra too. For instance,as I’m walking the path today that I always walk, I notice that one of myfavorite rocks is gone. What happened to it? There’s some mystery there. At themoment I recognize the rock’s movement, I’m taken into the realm of soul. I’vebeen mystified by a manifestation from the Underworld. On my mundane walkthrough the natural world, daily life has been deepened and the realm of thesoul has inserted itself, even as a lacuna. That’s how I prefer to relate withPluto.Even if you’re a good boy or girl and you follow the soul’s daily plan, youmight still be dragged down by rape and abduction. It’s an active universe,after all. Everything is always a possibility. We can’t be so arrogant to thinkthat we know what Pluto’s going to do with us or how it’s going to do it, howwe’re going to get into its realm.But daily Plutonian observation is an opportunity to visit the Underworld andthe soul on a regular basis. It is one of uniquely meaningful aspects of beingembodied in this form, alive. If we ignore it or neglect it and overvalue whatthe ego does as all-important, what capitalism produces as the lone authenticwealth, what materialism does is as the whole show, and start to locate ourvalues in machine glitter and economic affluence, we forfeit the subtler richesavailable in the Plutonian depths.Pluto is the actual source of treasure, not from the ego’s point of view butfrom the soul’s perspective. For the soul, Pluto is the realm of riches.Pluto can seem like the worst thing that ever happened to you when it isactually the best thing that could ever happen to you. But you have to recognizeit as what it is rather than by the robes and kitsch death symbols in which itappears. You have to meet it in the actual realm of the soul.*.
