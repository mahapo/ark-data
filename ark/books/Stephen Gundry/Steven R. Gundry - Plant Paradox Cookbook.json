Soon after I began giving mypatients a now-infamous list of “just say no” and “yes, please” foods and sentthem on their way with about ten recipes, I recognized the need for a morecomprehensive resource that could help them maintain their new way of eating.And so for years, I’ve been collecting recipes from friends and patients anddeveloping my own repertoire. It’s taken a lot of trial and error, tasting andtesting, and plenty of dirty dishes, but I’ve finally been able to compile thecollection of tasty, healthy, and diverse recipes that my patients—and youreaders—deserve.But let me back up a bit. If you’re just coming to this book without having readThe Plant Paradox, you may be thinking: what is this list you’re talking about,and why do I need it? For the past seventeen years, I’ve been treating patientswith a combination of nutritional therapy and conventional medicine. Peoplegenerally come to see me when they’re struggling with a chronic disease and justcan’t seem to get better. They arrive at one of my clinics—in Palm Springs orSanta Barbara—on a personal journey to regain their health or their loved one’shealth, or to take their “good enough” health to robust, vibrant health.As my patients and regular readers know, I saw and continue to see dramaticreversals of diseases I once thought impossible to manage; changes that we cantrack with sophisticated blood work and that my patients can feel and see. Manyof these changes are directly linked to nutritional alterations we’ve made totheir diets. And so I wrote The Plant Paradox to explain the philosophy behindthe list: the idea that proteins called lectins found in many common “healthfoods”—including fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans—can damage the gut, causeinflammation, and contribute to disease. Removing major lectin-containing foodsfrom the diet, combined with minimizing exposure to environmental toxins, arethe practices at the core of the Plant Paradox program.The Plant Paradox Cookbook is written first and foremost for all of you who haveapplied my “rules” and regained your health, but keep finding yourselves askingthat immortal question: “What the heck can I eat?” I know that you live in thereal world of two-job families, commutes, after-school practices, andsocializing, and that relatively few of you reside as I do in SouthernCalifornia, where beautiful, fresh produce is available year-round. And I knowthat thinking about going lectin-free can seem impossible, or at leastimpractical, when you already have too many things to manage on your to-do list.That’s why I’ve written a cookbook with simple recipes anyone can master andaccessible ingredients (and substitutions for less-accessible ingredients) youcan source easily. I’ve also incorporated your feedback and suggestions for thetypes of dishes you most wanted to see. No eating plan that encouragesdeprivation or sacrifice has ever worked, and for good reason: eating ispleasurable! I of all people understand and appreciate that point—I love a goodmeal and am not immune to the temptation of my old favorites. That’s why you’llfind Plant Paradox–approved versions of all of your most-loved foods in thisbook, from bagels and pancakes to pizza and pad Thai, spaghetti and meatballs tobrownies and ice cream. I know it’s hard to believe, but you can reap thebenefits of the program while indulging in all of these seemingly forbiddendishes.That brings me to the second reason for The Plant Paradox Cookbook: the PlantParadox program works! It’s just that simple. I’ve documented it in thousands ofpatients in my clinics and I’ve reported my results at major medicalconferences, but the real joy I get is when I receive an email or a letter, orread a review online, saying that this program has positively impacted someone’slife. Whether it’s finally losing weight after many failed attempts; loweringblood pressure and cholesterol markers; improving heart health; reducing orgoing off of immune-suppressive drugs or thyroid medications; resolving MS orlupus (and the attendant painful symptoms); or slowing or reversing theprogression of cancer or dementia, you’ve shared so many incredible successeswith me that I am truly humbled. Your stories are why I get up and go to workeach morning, and why I write books like this one: to make available to everyonethe healing powers of the Plant Paradox program.And lastly, this book is written for you “holdouts” who may have heard aboutthis crazy Plant Paradox thing, but are reluctant to give up your beloved grainsand favorite foods. This cookbook was written maybe most of all for you, to makeit easier for you to find out what all the fuss is really about and to give thislifestyle a try in the easiest possible way: by making delicious meals.So, even if you haven’t read The Plant Paradox, you can jump right in with thisbook and join the lectin-free (or at least lectin-light) club. Over the next fewchapters I’ll offer a brief overview of the Plant Paradox plan so that all ofus—old hands or newbies alike—will be up to speed and ready to dive into thekitchen!In case flipping through these pages and catching a glance of the gorgeousphotos hasn’t persuaded you, let me assure you: I’ve got incredible dishes fromJames Beard Award–winning chefs, contributions from my recipe contest atGundryMD.com, and a bunch of out-of-this-world recipes from patients andfollowers that I know you will love. And they were all made with you, yourhealth, your busy life, and your taste buds in mind. I can’t for you to trythem. Welcome to The Plant Paradox Cookbook!"},{"pageContent":"Part One [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rpt1]image [../images/linept.jpg]What Is the Plant Paradox?

Think of Michael Pollan’s elegant summation: “Eatfood. Mostly plants. Not too much.”Though I love a straightforward rule, there’s another elemental truth that wehave to consider: not all plants are good for us.In fact, certain plants can be harmful to your health, particularly those thatcontain a type of protein called a lectin, which is designed to cause harm toany creature that consumes the plant. And that’s the paradox: plants are bothfriend and enemy, source of health and, in certain instances, triggers ofdisease.Some plants are more dangerous than others, including many of the plants thathave long been considered to be some of the healthiest foods you could eat.Fruit, for example. And vegetables with seeds that are technically fruits (suchas cucumbers, tomatoes, squashes, zucchini, and eggplant). Wheat. Corn. Beansand other legumes.I know what you might be thinking—how could it possibly be true that the fresh,colorful foods in the produce section could actually be unhealthy? Or that thebeans, whole wheat bread, and brown rice we’ve hailed as health foods fordecades could actually cause us harm? Well, to really understand it, we have todo a little time travel. (I bet you didn’t expect to read that sentence in acookbook!)I want you to imagine that it is 450 million years ago. The only living thingson Earth are plants. With no predators, they rule the land, using theirincredible chemical ability to transform sunlight into matter to proliferate.Then, about 90 million years later, insects showed up. Suddenly, plants had todevelop defensive mechanisms to protect themselves and their babies (aka theirseeds) from being eaten, because plants don’t want to be killed and consumed anymore than you do, and they don’t want their babies to be eaten either. Like alllife forms, they are programmed to grow and reproduce, and being eaten puts thekibosh on all these biological imperatives.Since the arrival of insects, plants have been developing and refiningsophisticated ways to prevent other creatures—including humans, who first beganto evolve only about two to four million years ago—from eating them. That’s 340million years of evolution that plants have on us; 340 million years ofdeveloping defense mechanisms.You may think that plants are pretty helpless, but they actually possess animpressive arsenal of tactics to protect themselves from predators. For example,while they may not be able to run, they can hide by adapting their color toblend in with their surroundings. And while most plants can’t launch anoffensive attack, they can defend themselves by causing injury to any creaturethat eats them. This includes short-term strategies like poisoning, paralyzing,or entrapping their predators. It also includes the long-term strategy of makingthem very, very sick.Lectins are a long-term defense strategy. (Gluten is a lectin, you may besurprised to learn, but it’s certainly not the only one, nor even the mostdangerous. It’s just the media darling—the Kim Kardashian—of lectins.) As Imentioned, lectins are proteins—most are large, sticky proteins that are drawnto sugar molecules. When you eat a plant that is high in lectins, one of thenegative outcomes is that these proteins start marauding throughout yourdigestive tract, looking for sugar molecules to which they can hitch theirwagon. Your intestinal lining is only about one cell thick. While it isdelicate, it is elegantly designed to keep some food particles inside the gut(so they can ultimately be excreted as waste) and to allow the small particlesof vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients your body needs to pass through thewall and into the bloodstream. It does this through a series of tight junctionsthat function as gatekeepers between the cells in the lining of your gut.The way these tight junctions function is similar to a game of Red Rover—when aline of little kids locks arms together, they can keep out most other littlekids. But lectins lock onto the surface of your intestinal cells and flip aswitch that makes these tight junctions break apart. It is the equivalent of aplayground bully, ramming its way through the junctions between cells, enteringthe bloodstream and leaving holes in the gut wall that then allow other largemolecules, including bacteria, to seep through, creating a condition known as“leaky gut.”Once in the bloodstream, these intestinal escapees trigger an immuneresponse—because the body doesn’t recognize them, and it considers theminvaders. This fires up inflammation, which explains why so many of my patientshave high blood levels of inflammatory cytokines—chemicals that alert the immunesystem to a threat. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Lectin Paradox: They Are Both Good and BadIt’s so convenient when we can put things in definitive categories—bad guys areevil, good guys are heroes. But when it comes to lectins, they can actually playboth roles. Some lectins are inherently beneficial. Have you heard that garlichas healing properties? (It’s true, it does.) Its antiviral abilities are thanksto the lectins it contains. Other lectins play a positive role in the body eventhough they are technically toxic—in small amounts, they educate your immunesystem about what kinds of compounds are safe and which aren’t.To really wrap your brain around the paradox that plants—and the lectins theycontain—can be both good for us and bad for us, it helps to understand theconcept of hormesis. This principle tells us that certain compounds that areharmful in large amounts can be beneficial in small doses. In this case, it’snot the substance itself that’s harmful or not harmful, it’s how much of itwe’re exposed to over time that determines its effects. Another way of thinkingabout it is Paracelsus’s observation: “The dose makes the poison.”Hormesis points clearly to one health-promoting strategy, which is to eat avaried diet. That way, you don’t rely too much on any one thing. It alsoexplains why our recent shifts to relying more on a few crops for the majorityof our caloric intake, primarily wheat, corn, and soy, has made us moresusceptible to lectins than our ancestors were. I hope that the recipes in thiscookbook and the principles I share in this chapter will help you expand yourrepertoire to all kinds of foods that you weren’t consuming regularly before,whether that’s new-to-you, no-lectin grains such as millet and sorghum, or awider variety of green leafy and cruciferous vegetables. Thanks to hormesis,nature rewards the adventurous palate!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Human Evolution Hasn’t Caught UpRight about now you may well be wondering: if lectins have been around formillions of years, how have humans managed to survive all this time? How couldit be that plants are causing us a problem only now?Well, for one thing, the discovery of fire and subsequent development of cookingabout one hundred thousand years ago gave us a leg up over other animals,because cooking breaks down many lectins. Cooking also made it possible for usto start eating tubers, such as yams and sweet potatoes, which are indigestiblein their raw state but are, as you probably know, delectable once cooked. Thestarches from these tubers helped feed our friendly gut bacteria, known as themicrobiome, as well as the bacteria that live on the skin and even hover aroundus, known as the holobiome (kind of like the cloud that follows around thePeanuts character, Pig-Pen).The inhabitants of your microbiome play many important roles in your body, butthe two most crucial are that they break down the food you eat and extractnutrients from it and they communicate with your immune system, both alerting itto invaders and doing battle or de-weaponizing harmful substances. Because theyare so helpful to us, I call them our “gut buddies.”As our species evolved, so did our gut buddies to handle the lectins in theplants and leaves we consumed. We thrived as a result. When our diet mostlyconsisted of foraged plants, tubers, and the occasional woolly mammoth steak, wewere the picture of health—the average height for males was nearly five feeteleven inches tall (females averaged five foot two).1[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en1]Then, about ten thousand years ago, the last Ice Age ended and many of theanimals and plants that humans relied upon for our main source of calories diedoff. We had to find new foods to eat. That’s when the practice of cultivatingcrops was born. We started growing grains and beans—two plant foods that wererevolutionary because once harvested, they could be stored for later use. Whileon one hand this was a miraculous feat of ingenuity, it also introduced a wholenew array of lectins into our diet; lectins that we weren’t equipped to digest,and neither were our bacterial populations.Ten thousand years may seem like a long enough time for us to evolve amicrobiotic population that can handle lectins, but it’s not. You have toremember that Mother Nature has a completely different timetable than we do.Even though we can create new technologies (such as fire, agriculture, and wifi)at ever increasing speeds, she needs millennia to adapt to them. In evolutionaryterms, ten thousand years is a blink; it’s like we’ve been speed-dating lectins.Our bodies simply weren’t prepared to consume them once we started growing ourown food, and we still aren’t. Is it any wonder that after eating this new dietfor two thousand years, the average human height was five feet four inches formales and four feet nine inches for females?2 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en2]Fast forward to just five hundred years ago, when the “New World”—aka theAmericas—was discovered, and our ancestors from Africa, Europe, and Asia wereintroduced to new, lectin-rich foods they’d never before encountered: tomatoes,squash, corn, chia seeds, quinoa, and other grains. Native American populations,who had been eating these foods for about fifteen to twenty thousand years, mayhave had the time to develop some specialized gut bugs to digest them. But thosenew to Western agriculture had no such capacity.Before they arrived on the shores of the Americas, our ancestors had learned toprepare and preserve foods in ways that, however coincidentally, made themeasier to digest. Fermentation is one such method. Traditional cultures havelong used fermentation as a means of preserving vegetables and dairyproducts—think kefir in the Middle East, sauerkraut in Eastern Europe, yogurt inIndia, kimchi in Korea, or miso in Japan (these are just a handful of examples).Many old world cooking methods also removed the peels, hulls, and seeds fromplants, which are the parts that tend to contain the highest concentration oflectins. For example, in Asia, where rice is a staple crop, the hull istypically removed to create white rice. In Europe, where breads and pastas areculinary mainstays, the wheat is similarly stripped of its protective (andlectin-rich) bran and was traditionally eaten only when fresh—a day-old bakedgood was considered inedible, because when you grind a grain its naturallyoccurring fats spoil very quickly.When our ancestors encountered new foods, these traditional preparation methodshelped to protect them from consuming harmful amounts of lectins. For more thanfive hundred years, we continued to use these methods to make our foods moredigestible. But in the last one hundred years or so, changes in our culture,food supply, and technology have made us more susceptible to damage fromlectins. These changes include: * Year-round access to fruits and other produce that would otherwise only be available during a short season, meaning we’re eating more of these foods that we originally ate only once a year to fatten up for the upcoming winter. * A disconnection from traditional means of preparing foods (which reduce lectin content) and an overreliance on processed foods that are made primarily from grains and processed oils that are high in lectins. * An increase in the amount of wheat, corn, and soy we consume—in the form of bread, animal feed (since we essentially end up eating whatever the animals we consume eat), vegetable oil, and processed food. * Exposure to decades’ and millions of dollars’ worth of marketing regarding the healthfulness of whole grains and vegetable oils—which are essentially lectin bombs—leaving us woefully confused about which foods actually promote good health. Generations of Americans have loaded up on whole wheat bread and pasta and multigrain bagels thinking that they were making healthy choices—while rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease skyrocketed.So not only have our bodies not yet evolved new gut bugs to deal with newlectins, we’re also no longer preparing high-lectin foods in the ways ourancestors did, and we’re eating more of these foods than ever before. But wait:there’s more.The Seven Deadly DisruptorsRecent developments in the medicine we take and the environment in which we liveare also hurting our health. These technological “advances” are actually settingus back in many ways and wreaking havoc on the quantity and diversity of our gutmicrobes.I call these modern developments the Seven Deadly Disruptors. I go into great(some might say painstaking) detail about them in The Plant Paradox, but for ourpurposes here I will try to be brief. 1. BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS. While antibiotics can be a life-saving drug, they can also threaten your long-term health by wiping out your supportive bacterial population. We tend to take antibiotics too frequently (you do not need an antibiotic for a cold or the flu!), and we unwittingly consume them every time we eat conventionally raised meat, as most livestock are fed antibiotics to help them stay alive and to fatten them up for slaughter. Think about that: antibiotics are used to fatten animals for slaughter. They do the same to you! 2. NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS). Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), Celebrex, and others are popular pain relievers that fall in the category of NSAIDs. NSAIDs damage the lining of the small intestine and colon, which is also targeted by lectins and plays a crucial role in keeping your immune system in good working order. In a cruel cycle, when you regularly take NSAIDs, the damage in your intestinal wall leads to more inflammation, which leads to more pain, which causes you to keep reaching for NSAIDs. 3. STOMACH-ACID BLOCKERS. When an animal eats a plant with a lot of lectins—such as unripe fruit, for example—it will get a stomachache and quickly learn to avoid that particular plant in the future. When a human eats something that causes indigestion, we reach for an acid-blocking drug such as Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, or Protonix. These drugs, most of which are protein pump inhibitors (PPIs), reduce the amount of stomach acid, which may seem like a good thing until you learn that stomach acid is a key way that your body neutralizes harmful bacteria. And the more bad bacteria you have, the less room and resources your good bacteria have. Since your friendly bacteria play such an important role in immunity, it’s no coincidence that people who use acid blockers (and have fewer good gut bugs) have three times the likelihood of getting pneumonia than those who don’t. PPIs also inhibit protein digestion, and as you may remember, lectins are plant proteins. So more PPIs also means more lectins on the loose. 4. ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. No one hates to hear just how damaging artificial sweeteners are more than me—I was a huge Diet Coke addict for years. I drank eight cans a day! Not coincidentally, I was also seventy pounds overweight. The false sweetness doesn’t help you lose weight by saving you calories. On the contrary, it decimates your friendly bacterial population3 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en3] and triggers your brain to seek more sweets and store fat for the winter (which is also what eating fruit in the summer will do). And when you have fewer helpful microbes to eat lectins, lectins can wreak more havoc inside your body. 5. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the normal functioning of your hormones. They are commonly found in plastics, including personal care products, household cleaners, food packaging, cling wrap, food storage containers, and any number of other consumer products. Endocrine disruptors are also found in the food beneath the plastic. Remember how I said that the fats in whole grains quickly spoil once they’ve been ground? Well, food industry scientists are aware of this and thus add chemical stabilizing agents, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), to packaged baked goods. BHT is an endocrine disruptor. No matter where they come from, endocrine disruptors play a role in obesity, many cancers, thyroid problems, and reproductive issues. They also tax your liver—which is the waste treatment plant of your body—and make it harder for it to eliminate excess hormones and to convert vitamin D into its active form. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with numerous diseases, including autoimmune diseases, dementia, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Moreover, vitamin D helps to keep the wall of your gut intact in the battle with lectins. Less vitamin D, more lectins, more “leaky gut.” 6. GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND THE HERBICIDE ROUNDUP. Most genetically modified foods have been bred to withstand the pesticide known as glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup, a pesticide made by Monsanto and Enlist, which is manufactured by Dow Chemical. Because the GMO plants don’t die when exposed to glyphosate, farmers can douse their fields with the stuff and the main crop—generally wheat, corn, or soy—won’t die. But here’s what you probably didn’t know: Roundup is now used on non-GMO versions of these same plants as a desiccant, because a dried-up, dead plant is easier to harvest. This practice is particularly common with oats, grains, legumes, and beans, which means it’s incredibly important to choose organic versions of these foods (if you choose to eat them at all; following the Plant Paradox guidelines will help you avoid many of these foods, but keep it in mind if you continue to eat beans—preferably beans that have been pressure-cooked to destroy their lectins, something I’ll cover more in Chapter 2 [9780062843388_Chapter_2.xhtml]). These chemicals are passed along to who- or whatever eats the crop, whether it’s you, your kids, or the animals that eventually show up on your dinner table. This means you get a dose of Roundup even if you meticulously avoid GMO foods but eat either nonorganic grains or meat that was fed nonorganic grains. In addition to being classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization4 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en4] (although different divisions of the organization disagree on this assessment,5 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en5] and a study published in November 2017, found no increased incidence of cancer in farm workers who handled glyphosate6 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en6]) and found to contribute to fatty liver disease at low doses in rats,7 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en7] Roundup also depletes your friendly gut bacteria. 7. BLUE LIGHT. Your body is exquisitely designed to take its cues for fat storage and fat burning from its daily exposure to light. When days are long and nights are short (in summer), we are cued to store fat in preparation for the coming winter, when food was typically scarce. And when days are short and nights are long, our body gets a signal to burn its own fat stores since calories from food were generally reduced. Now, we stare at electronic devices all day that emit blue light—the part of the light spectrum that comprises daylight—making our internal clocks think it’s summer all the time. As a result, we are continually getting the message to store fat and to seek out more calories.Lectins and AutoimmunityYour digestive tract is a sealed tube that starts at your mouth, goes down yourthroat, and coils around in your abdomen, leading to your anus. Any foodparticles that enter that tube aren’t technically part of your body—they stay inthe tube. It’s like a tunnel that goes through a river; you travel in thattunnel, you are surrounded by water but you don’t get wet because you aren’tactually in the river.All food you consume travels down the throat, through the esophagus, into thestomach, and eventually makes its way to your intestines to be transformed intotiny molecules of nutrients that your body can use or excrete as waste. If youstretched out your intestines, they would cover the surface area of a tenniscourt. However, the width of the intestinal wall—which is all that separates thefood you eat from your bloodstream—is only one cell thick, and these cellsnormally have an impenetrable seal between them. Your intestinal wall isdesigned to let single molecules of digested food, individual amino acids, fattyacids, and sugars pass from inside your gut to your bloodstream—that’s it. Inorder to shore up the gut wall, your body produces a mucous barrier on theinside of it, and that mucus is made of up polysaccharides, which are a form ofsugar.When you eat lectins, remember, they are looking for sugar molecules to attachto. So what do they do? They bind to the sugar molecules in the mucosal liningof your intestines. Once there, they trigger the production of zonulin, which isa protein that serves as a key to open those tight junctions between the cellsof your gut wall. When your cells produce zonulin, they stop linking arms, andany lectins that haven’t yet bound to the mucus lining seep out of the tunneland into the bloodstream, bringing with them pieces of bacteria calledlipopolysaccharides, or LPS for short. I don’t normally swear, but I can’tresist calling them “little pieces of shit,” because that’s what they are.Literally. This phenomenon is known as leaky gut syndrome, and it’s wherelectins become really destructive.On the other side of that wall is your immune system. Think of your immunesystem like a border patrol. When the immune system comes in contact with anyforeign substance, it sounds the alarm: The wall has been breached! We’re underattack! Prepare for war! Stockpile supplies and assemble the army! The suppliesin this case are fat cells, the army is made up of white blood cells, and theweapon this army uses is inflammation. This is why the body stores fat wherevera war is being waged. And when the war is in your gut, the result is abdominalfat—which Dr. William Davis made famous as a “wheat belly.” Even worse, though,when the immune system remains continually in war mode, what is a healthyresponse can easily cross over into full-on autoimmune disease, which is whathappens when the immune system attacks healthy cells of the body that aren’tdangerous or invaders. Common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis,Crohn’s disease, lupus, Hashimoto’s disease, MS, Grave’s disease, celiacdisease, vitiligo, psoriasis, IBS, and type 1 diabetes. In my practice, I haveseen patients resolve their autoimmune issues simply by removing lectins fromtheir diet. That’s because by avoiding or neutralizing lectins in your food, youremove a root cause of autoimmunity and give your gut and your microbiome achance to heal.In a fascinating paper published in 2017 in the Journal of Diabetes Research,8[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en8] researchers from Harvard Medical School andLoma Linda University School of Medicine tested the autoimmune response ofpancreatic islet cells in the presence of a number of different foods, all ofwhich are on the low-glycemic diet recommended to diabetic patients. The vastmajority of foods they found to provoke an autoimmune response are high inlectins, including cow’s milk, non-gluten grains such as buckwheat and oats,lentils, peas, and chickpeas. Interestingly, seaweed, pecans, and goat’s milkalso triggered significant responses, and wheat—which contains gluten—didn’tscore as high as many non-gluten grains. While the paper doesn’t prove causationbetween eating these foods and type 1 diabetes (the form of the disease with anautoimmune component), it does show that many lectin-rich foods are associatedwith an autoimmune response in the pancreatic cells that become damaged andcontribute to type 1 diabetes, suggesting that we need to revamp our foodrecommendations for diabetics. But why wait until you or your child hasdeveloped type 1 diabetes to remove a known autoimmunity trigger from your diet?How Lectins Cause Weight GainAs we’ve just discussed, eating high-lectin foods like wheat cues your body tostore fat because the lectins they contain wage war on your gut, and the troopsneed food (aka stored fat) to keep battling. And as we know from our discussionof the microbiome, lectins also deplete beneficial gut microbes, which supportour well-being in a number of important ways—including helping to maintain ahealthy weight.But there’s also a third reason why eating lectin-rich foods contributes toexcess weight: because one of the lectins in many grains (in addition to gluten)is wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is one of the most offensive lectins outthere and has been implicated in celiac disease and heart disease. One of its(as well as other lectins’) most insidious powers, however, is that it has theability to mimic insulin in the body.Insulin is a hormone that’s manufactured by the pancreas, which releases varyingamounts of it in response to the amount of sugar and protein you eat. Insulinhelps regulate your blood sugar levels by attaching to either fat cells, nervecells (or neurons), or muscle cells and ordering them to open up and let theglucose in. Once the glucose is moved into the cell, the insulin detaches andthese cells are able to receive messages from other hormones and chemicalmessengers.But WGA binds to the same receptor sites on these cell walls that insulin does.And it doesn’t ever leave. So the next time your gut releases glucose into yourbloodstream, the insulin doesn’t have a place to attach to. It’s kind of likeinsulin is you in your car and the cell wall is the grocery store parking lot.If all the parking spaces are filled with other cars, and no one ever leaves,you can never park and actually go into the store to get the food you need.When WGA attaches to your fat cells, it can stay there indefinitely as well,continually telling them to make more fat from the sugar that passes by. When itparks on the wall of a muscle cell, it prevents any sugar cells from getting in.As a result, your muscle cell can’t access the fuel it needs to maintain itselfand grow; muscle wasting is the outcome. And when lectins take up residence oninsulin receptors on nerve cells, your neurons never get the energy that theyneed, and so they continually send a message that you’re hungry in hopes ofgetting more fuel. So your nervous system keeps sending hunger signals, evenwhen you’ve had plenty of calories. The sum result of WGA mimicking insulin isthat your fat cells grow, your calorie consumption rises, your brain cells don’tget the fuel they need (leading to brain fog), and muscle tone reduces. Does anyof this sound familiar?The Road Back to Good HealthThe good news is that once you understand what lectins are and where they comefrom, it is possible to settle into a way of eating that has cascading positiveeffects on health—from troubling symptoms like bloating and brain fog up tooutright disease such as heart disease and autoimmune disease.Even better, as I will show you in the chapters to come, these foods that are sogood for your immune system and supportive of your friendly gut bacteriapopulation are also delicious. Whether or not you follow the full Plant Paradoxplan (which I will outline in Chapter 2 [9780062843388_Chapter_2.xhtml]), you’llfind recipes here for foods that satisfy your inner gut buddies and your tastebuds."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Two [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch2]image [../images/linech.jpg]“So What Exactly Can I Eat?!” [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch2]image [../images/linech.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"After people read The Plant Paradox, one of the most common reactions I get is“What’s left for me to eat??”I promise you, I am not out to deprive you of the foods you love—that’s why Iwrote this cookbook.There are some foods that I will suggest you stop eating altogether, and yes,that will be an adjustment, but I’m going to go out on a limb here and wagerthat you weren’t really enjoying some of them—like whole wheat bread and brownrice—to begin with.The great news is that many of your favorite high-lectin foods can be cooked orprepared in such a way to reduce their lectin content. So no, you don’t have togive up beans or tomatoes for the rest of your life, but you can make it easieron your gut and your immune system by preparing them a little differently.I do want to be clear about one thing: There is no way to eliminate every singlelectin from your diet, nor would I suggest you try to do so. In fact, not alllectins are troublesome—plants have been creating these chemical compounds formillions of years, and some of them do foster human health, particularly thosecontained in plants we’ve been eating for millennia. For some of my“canaries”—the patients in my practice who show higher-than-average sensitivityto lectins—small amounts of certain lectins are enough to trigger severereactions. But other patients of mine consumed large quantities oflectin-containing foods for years without noticing an effect.Remember, our bodies don’t adapt to new conditions, or new foods, overnight. Ourmicrobiomes and our immune system have had ample time to adjust to the lectinsand other compounds contained in the plants we’ve been eating for millennia(such as those on the “yes, please” list below). It’s the “newer” foods—thosewe’ve only been eating for about ten thousand years—that are the mostproblematic for our physiologies. These foods include grains and beans and NewWorld plants like corn and tomatoes. So while it’s impossible to avoid alllectins, you can radically improve your health by controlling which ones youconsume and how much of them you eat. Like the line in the 1956 movie The CourtJester, “The pellet with the poison’s in the flagon with the dragon; the vesselwith the pestle has the brew that is true,” I just want to give you a guide towhere the poisons are lurking.Let’s start with the brew that is true.Yes, Please: Foods That Are Low in LectinsGOOD FATSGenerally, I advise that anywhere between 60 and 80 percent of your total dailycalories come from healthy fat sources. I know—that sounds like an awful lot offat! Especially in light of all the misguided nutritional advice we’ve been fed(pardon the pun) for years about fat being bad for us. Some fat is bad for us,but not all fat is created equal. While there are many oils that I don’trecommend consuming, such as those made from high-lectin vegetable seeds, goodquality fats are essential for your health.Believe it or not, eating fat can actually help you lose weight. Healthy fatsdon’t contain glucose (which gets stored as fat when you eat too much of it) ortrigger the release of insulin (which tells the body to store excess glucose asfat) like carbohydrates do. Some types of fat also help to protect and nourishthe cells of your gut lining.9 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en9] In addition,your brain is comprised of 60 percent fat, so eating healthy fat also feeds yourbrain. The best sources of healthy fats are extra-virgin olive oil, olives,avocados, avocado oil, coconut milk, MCT oil (otherwise known as medium-chaintriglyceride oil or liquid coconut oil), coconut oil, perilla oil, walnut oil,macadamia oil, algae oil, egg yolks from pastured chicken, and most importantly,fish oil or algae-based DHA. These foods, along with leafy greens andcruciferous vegetables, should form the foundation of your daily food intake.GREENSGreen leafy vegetables are so good for you it’s nearly impossible to eat morethan you need; nearly everyone’s diet is lacking in greens. These plants arehigh in chemicals called polyphenols that support full-body health. Wherelectins protect their host plants by causing harm to any creatures that consumethe plant, polyphenols make the plants themselves stronger. And so, when we eatpolyphenols, they lend us some of their restorative powers. Beyond thepolyphenols that greens provide, they are very filling, especially when combinedwith a healthy fat, like a generous covering of olive or avocado oil. Meaning,eating more greens will naturally reduce any cravings for less healthful foods.In fact, you’ll find that you start craving greens instead!Good sources of greens include lettuce (romaine, butter, red, and green leaf),dandelion greens, mesclun, spinach, endive, parsley, mustard greens, fennel, andseaweed/sea vegetables.CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES AND LECTIN-FREE VEGETABLESVegetables are excellent sources of prebiotic fiber, vitamins, and polyphenols,and should comprise the majority of your meals. Cruciferous vegetables areespecially nutritious and offer a number of health benefits. They activatespecialized white blood cells in the lining of your gut, and those cells havethe ability to tell an overactive immune system to stand down. Since eating ahigh-lectin diet has likely irritated your gut wall and prompted your immunesystem into a hyper-aroused state, cruciferous veggies are just the thing tohelp restore your gut health. Good choices include broccoli, cabbage,cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Swiss chard, bok choy,watercress, kohlrabi, and arugula. And don’t neglect other lectin-free veggiessuch as artichokes, asparagus, garlic, celery, leeks, radishes, beets,mushrooms, okra, and onions—they will fill you up and deliver a tasty cocktailof nutrients!NUTSNuts are a great source of healthy fats, polyphenols, and fiber, and are okay toeat every day, but in limited amounts (because their caloric and protein contentcan add up quickly). They make fabulous snacks because they are portable (it’seasy to keep a stash in your desk drawer or glove box) and filling. It’simportant to note, however, that not every nut is compatible with the PlantParadox program. Legumes like peanuts and cashews should be avoided. I recommendsticking to macadamias, walnuts, pistachios, pecans, coconuts, hazelnuts, andchestnuts. Some nuts can also be used as flour alternatives—your best bets arecoconut flour or almond flour. Everyone asks about almonds. The skin or peel ofalmonds have a lectin that many of my autoimmune patients react to; blanched orMarcona almonds are peeled and seem to be safe. That’s why blanched almond flourmakes the list and almonds do not.AVOCADOSYes, we covered avocados in the “Good Fats” section just a few paragraphsearlier in this section, but it’s such a nutritional superstar and so readilyavailable that it’s worth calling out on its own. Avocados are full of good fatand soluble fiber, both of which are key to helping you lose weight and absorbpolyphenols (many plant-based vitamins are fat soluble, meaning you need to eatthem with a fat in order to reap their benefits). Avocados contain heart-healthymonounsaturated fat, just like olive oil. In fact, eating an avocado a day hasbeen shown to reduce LDL cholesterol—the dangerous kind of cholesterol—by 13.5mg/dl.10 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en10] That’s a significant amount for oneeasy dietary change! Now, avocado is a fruit, but it’s actually okay to eat whenripe because it’s essentially sugar-free. You’re already accustomed to the ideathat eating one piece of fruit every day—namely, an apple—can keep the doctoraway. Just replace that apple with an avocado and you will be well on your wayto promoting a healthy heart and a healthy weight.LECTIN-FREE GRAINSI know it’s challenging to think about giving up all grains—not only are theyincredibly convenient because they are ubiquitous, they’re also probably whatyou’ve come to consider as your go-to foods. Sandwiches, granola bars, wraps,cereal—grains are some of the easiest convenience foods, and they’re oftenmarketed to us as “health foods.” Nothing could be further from the truth!But there are a couple of grains that don’t contain lectins—sorghum and millet,to be exact. Sorghum is an awesome lectin-free, gluten-free flour alternativethat’s chock full of fiber. It also contains chemical compounds that have beenshown to be beneficial to friendly gut bacteria and positively impact obesity,diabetes, and inflammation in animals and in in vitro lab tests.11[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en11] Millet is packed with important mineralslike magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc. Not only that, the polyphenolsin millet offer more health benefits than most grains.12[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en12] If you’re wondering how to prepare and servethese grains, check out the recipes for my Sorghum Bowl[9780062843388_Recipe_42.xhtml#sec42], Moroccan-Spiced Chicken with MilletTabbouleh [9780062843388_Recipe_53.xhtml#sec53], and Thanksgiving MilletStuffing [9780062843388_Recipe_64.xhtml#sec64].RESISTANT STARCHESResistant starches are carbohydrates that give you a (mostly) free pass when itcomes to their caloric content and impact on blood sugar levels. When you eat atypical carbohydrate, such as a piece of bread or bowl of rice, your bodyquickly converts it to glucose, which is then either burned for energy or storedas fat. A resistant starch, on the other hand, does not get broken down andconverted into glucose quickly—and much of it passes through your smallintestine intact. This is because these starches aren’t susceptible to theenzymes that break down regular starches; that’s why they’re called “resistant.”While you can’t digest resistant starches, your friendly gut bacteria can. Theyproliferate on a diet of resistant starches and crowd out the bad bugs that alsolive in your digestive tract.13 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en13] In addition,your gut buddies convert resistant starches to short-chain fatty acids, many ofwhich are a preferred form of fuel for your colon and your neurons, even theneurons in your far-away brain.Sweet potatoes, yams, yucca, green plantains, cassava, tapioca, green bananas,jicama, and taro root are all resistant starches as well as great sources ofvitamins and minerals. That’s because these tubers have roots with strongabsorption abilities that draw water and minerals from the soil for nourishment.Also, they’re high in fiber, which is a source of fuel for your gut bugs. It’sokay to eat resistant starches every day, just try to eat them in moderation andlimit the quantity with each meal. Over years of tracking thousands of patientsand their eating habits and blood work, I’ve noticed that some of my overzealousresistant-starch eaters start to gain excess weight. I mean, who wouldn’t gainweight eating three big plantain pancakes three times a day with a sweet potatoas a side dish?WILD-CAUGHT SEAFOODFish and shellfish are some of the healthiest and tastiest foods out there.Seafood is a great source of protein and provides vitamin D and omega-3 fattyacids, which have numerous benefits, including reducing inflammation,14[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en14] protecting against heart disease,15[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en15] and boosting brain health.The thing is, you want to make sure the seafood that ends up on your plate iswild-caught and not farm-raised, even if it is labeled organic. Among otherthings, farm-raised fish, because of the crowded conditions, are often treatedwith antibiotics or even treated with pesticides and fed corn and soy (both ofwhich are full of lectins), whereas wild-caught fish have eaten a natural diet.Please don’t be misled by the organic label on salmon or other fish. The organiclabel means they were fed organic grains and soy. Do you really think theyfollowed the salmon around the ocean to see that they ate “organically”? My wifeand I tend to eat mostly vegetarian or vegan during the week, but on theweekends we have a serving of wild seafood each day, for variety and for taste.I call our approach to eating “Vegaquarian.”PASTURED POULTRY AND OMEGA-3 EGGSPastured poultry can be a great source of protein and, if you eat the yolks ofyour eggs or the skin on your chicken, fat. But pastured is not the same thingas free-range or organic. Often, free-range chickens are never shown the lightof day. And they’re fed corn and soy. So the only type of poultry I recommendyou eat is pastured. These are chickens that have been allowed to roam andforage for their food—as insectivores, their natural diet is grubs and otherinsects. Look for the words “pasture-raised” or “pastured” on the label of thechickens, or talk to the farmers at your local farmer’s market and ask how theirchickens are fed. (I asked this question of a farmer at my local market in SantaBarbara, and she said, “I don’t feed my chickens anything, they work for me!”Meaning they fed themselves lots of tasty bugs.)When it comes to eggs, I recommend purchasing either pastured eggs (meaning eggsfrom chickens that were allowed to roam and forage for their food) or omega-3eggs (eggs you can purchase at most grocery stores that say “omega-3” somewhereon the label). As we’ve just discussed, omega-3 acids are important for yourhealth, and research shows omega-3 eggs can help lower cholesterol.16[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en16] And believe it or not, I want you to eat theyolks and limit the whites! Yes, exactly the opposite of the “yolks are bad foryou” old dietary advice. Try a four-yolk, one-egg-white omelet and give theother egg whites to your dog or cat.One-hundred Percent Grass-fed MeatLet’s pause for a moment to celebrate: You can have meat! But it must bespecific kind of meat: grass-fed and pasture-raised. Why are these designationsimportant? Remember, you are what the thing you are eating ate. If you eat meatfrom animals that were fed corn and soy, you are essentially eating lectin-richcorn and soy, much of which has been genetically modified to contain even morelectins than unadulterated strains of the same plants. Moreover, most grains andsoy are now sprayed with Roundup, which makes its way into the meats of theseanimals and therefore into you.So when you eat meat, absolutely make sure it was grass-fed and grass-finished.The meat from these animals contains more omega-3 and fewer omega-6 fats, whichare easily oxidized and thus inflammatory, than animals raised on conventionalfeed lots. Suitable choices include bison, wild game, venison, boar, elk, pork(humanely raised), lamb, beef, and prosciutto di Parma. But, like dairy,moderation is key, because all of this meat contains a specific sugar molecule,Neu5Gc, which is associated with cancer and heart disease. Ideally, you’ll keepyour consumption of animal protein to four ounces or less per day, and certainlyno more than eight ounces (and don’t even think about a twenty-four-ounceporterhouse!). We’ll talk about other reasons to limit your animal proteinintake a little bit later in this chapter. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Deciphering the Labels on Poultry, Eggs, and MeatBecause you end up consuming whatever the animals you eat consumed, you want tobe choosy when selecting the chickens, eggs, and meats you buy at the store.Unfortunately, the labels on these food items are confusing and sometimesdownright misleading. This chart can help you determine what each designationmeans, so you can choose the animal product that best serves your needs fornutrition.WHEN THE LABEL SAYS . . .IT MEANS . . .ORGANICWhen it comes to meat, poultry, and eggs, the organic designation means theanimals aren’t fed growth hormones or antibiotics, they are fed organic feed(meaning no GMOs or chemical pesticides or fertilizers used to grow the grainsand soy used for feed), and they must have outdoor access. “Organic” is the onlylabel that requires government inspection and verification. It’s a good label tolook for when buying meat, but the very best label is “pastured” or “grass-fedand -finished.” This is because grains and soy are not a natural diet forchickens (who eat insects) or for cows (who eat grasses) or other animals raisedfor meat, meaning even an organic diet is nutritionally lacking for animals.ALL VEGETARIAN-FEDFound mostly on poultry products, this means the chickens weren’t fed animalby-products. Which likely means that they were given feed that contains grains,pseudo-grains, and/or soy, most of which are loaded with lectins and GMO. Beyondthat, chickens are natural insect-eaters, so a vegetarian diet isn’t actuallyall that healthy for them!FREE RANGEThis designation, as codified in a 2007 federal law, means that animals aregiven access to the outside for at least five minutes a day. Free-range chickenstypically still live in a crowded barn that has some sort of opening—no matterhow small—to the outside. This outside can be a small, muddy, fenced-in ornetted-in yard, and the barn may be so crowded that most chickens never make itout.CAGE FREEThough it may conjure images of chickens freely roaming around a grass field,cage-free means that the chickens aren’t confined to cages—but they are stilllikely to be confined to an overcrowded barn with no guarantee of ever goingoutside.PASTURE-RAISED“Pasture-raised” hens have to be limited to 1,000 birds for every 2.5 acres.That’s 108 sq. ft. per bird—approximately 106 sq. ft. more per bird thanrequired for the “free range” designation. Field rotation is mandatory, meaningthe hens have to get continual access to grassy fields, not the same area thathas already been picked over day and after day by the flock. Also, the hens mustbe kept outdoors throughout the year—with safe, accessible housing should thehens need to protect themselves from predators, or shelter themselves fromextreme weather. When it comes to chicken, pasture-raised really is the higheststandard possible.OMEGA-3You’ll see this term on some egg cartons—it means the eggs were laid by hens whoconsume a natural diet enhanced with flaxseed and/or algae. When the flax andalgae is digested, the polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid gets transferred tothe yolk. In a recent study, omega-3 eggs had approximately five times as muchomega-3 fatty acid as conventional eggs.17 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en17]Although these chickens likely aren’t allowed to forage for their natural dietof grasses and insects and whatever else they can pick out of a patch of dirt,omega-3 eggs are often your best alternative if you can’t find eggs fromchickens that were pasture-raised.HORMONE-FREEYou’ll see this term on egg cartons as well as labels of poultry and meat. Itsimply means the animals weren’t administered any hormones. It doesn’t mean theyweren’t fed lectin-rich or GMO grains or animal by-products, or givenantibiotics.ANTIBIOTIC-FREESimilar to the “hormone-free” designation, this means only that the animalsdidn’t get antibiotic injections or have antibiotics added to their feed. Itdoesn’t mean they were fed a natural diet or that they weren’t given hormones.GRASS-FEDGenerally used in relation to beef and other animals raised for beef, thisdesignation only means the animals were given access to grass at some point intheir lives. Animals raised for meat are often given hay and access to grass fora little while, then fattened up for slaughter on a diet of grains, antibiotics,and growth hormones. That’s why you want to look for meat that either says“grass-fed and grass-finished” or “100 percent grass-fed,” because these meanthe animals ate their natural diet for their whole life.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IN-SEASON FRUITSFruit is a good source of fiber, vitamins, and polyphenols, but you must be verymindful of how much you eat and when you eat it. First of all, because itcontains so much sugar, think of it more like candy than a “health food” and eatit sparingly. In addition, the fruit must be—I repeat, must be—in season. Turnsout, eating fruit in season was a great thing for our ancestors, because itallowed them to fatten up for the winter months. But now, we can get fruitanytime—and thus, send the signal to our bodies that we need to store fat allyear long. (If you’re interested, I go into significant detail as to whyin-season fruits should be viewed as a treat in The Plant Paradox.)There are a few fruits that are great to eat year-round. The only hitch is,they’ve got to be eaten while they’re still green. They include bananas,mangoes, and papayas.These fruits are okay to consume year-round because when unripe, they’ve not yetexpanded their sugar content. And the good bacteria in our guts love to feast onthe perfect prebiotic fibers they contain.Want the benefit of fruit without the sugar? Bring your juicer out of storage,juice your fruits and berries, throw the juice away (or give it to your friendwho’s on a “juice cleanse”), and use the pulp! Mix it with coconut or goatyogurt, or add it to a smoothie of greens and protein.SPECIFIC TYPES OF DAIRYNearly all of the cow’s milk dairy available in the United States and Canadacomes from breeds of cows (including Holstein, the most common breed of cowworldwide) that produce a lectin-like protein known as casein A1. The good newsis that milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo (as well as milk fromGuernsey, Brown Swiss, and Belgian Blue breeds of cows, although these cows arerare in North America) does not contain this protein and so can be enjoyed onthe Plant Paradox program.As it turns out, casein A1 is converted to protein called beta-casomorphin,which can prompt an autoimmune attack on the human pancreas when consumed.18[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en18] This is then believed to cause some serioushealth concerns, such as type 1 diabetes.So, stick to Southern European cow’s milk, goat’s milk, sheep’s milk, andbuffalo milk and the cheeses made from these milks. Health food stores arepretty good about carrying these (I recommend specific brands in the recipesection). Also, consider these milks an indulgence and consume them only inmoderate quantities, as they do contain Neu5Gc.CHOCOLATE AND APPROVED ALCOHOLCocoa or specifically cacao, the primary ingredient in chocolate, is anundeniable health food—it contains polyphenols, flavonoids, and fiber, all ofwhich have anti-inflammatory properties. Chocolate is also known to be hearthealthy: the British Medical Journal published a study offering evidence thateating chocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by up to onethird!19 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en19] Just as importantly, it isdelicious and can really soothe cravings for something sweet. The problem isthat the sugar and dairy products that are often added to cocoa to makecommercial chocolates not all that good for you, and they tend to be highlycaloric as well, which leads to weight gain. In order to get the benefits ofchocolate without incurring the downsides, eat dark chocolate—72 percent cocoaor higher—and limit yourself to one ounce a day or less.Consuming red wine in moderation can actually help your health—studies haveshown that the polyphenols in red wine might be connected to reduced risk ofcardiovascular disease and other heart health issues.20[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en20] Limit wine consumption to onefour-to-six-ounce glass a day, only during meals. When drinking red wine, choosecool-climate pinot noirs such as Oregonian wines or red wines from highelevations such as an Argentinian malbec or Chilean cabernet. Why? Chillyweather and high elevations are good for producing high concentrations ofresveratrol—a powerful polyphenol. If you do buy Argentinian or Chilean wines,make sure to buy organic and/or biodynamic. (Wine from these countries isusually high in pesticides due to lack of regulation.) Avoid white wine, as ittends to have more sugar and lacks the powerful polyphenols—namely, resveratroland quercetin—contained in red wine.Also, if you’re going to drink liquor, choose a dark spirit, such as whisky,that has been aged in a wood barrel. Why? The wood in the barrels containspolyphenols that are then absorbed into the spirit. Avoid clear spirits, such asvodka.And if you really want to be festive, opt for a glass of champagne. The grapesthat go into champagne contain important polyphenols that potentially improvememory.21 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en21] Again, all these alcoholicbeverages should be consumed in very moderate amounts.Just Say No: Foods High in LectinsThe Plant Paradox program is based on this essential truth: The foods you don’teat are far more important to your health than the foods you do eat.We will discuss this idea in more detail in Chapter 3[9780062843388_Chapter_3.xhtml], but the basic premise of the Plant Paradoxprogram is that once you remove the inflammatory agents (aka lectins) from yourdiet, your body is able to stop throwing all its resources and energy intodealing with continual damage and go into restorative mode, where excess weightcan be released and diseases can be healed.To that end, here are the basic categories of foods that are excluded from thePlant Paradox program. These are foods that no human ate until about tenthousand years ago—and today we are still woefully ill-equipped to digest them.I’ve compiled all of these “yes, please” and “no, thank you” foods into a muchhandier list, which appears later in this chapter[9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#page_29]. You’ll notice the list of “yes,please” foods is more than twice as long as the list of “no, thank you” foods.But because knowing the reason why a food should be avoided will help empoweryou to consistently choose not to eat it. Let’s chat briefly about what makesthese food off-limits.PEANUTS AND CASHEWSDespite the fact that you probably think of these two popular foods as nuts,they are not. They are legumes, and as such are loaded with killer lectins. Infact, the shell that sheaths a cashew is so caustic that workers must wearprotective gloves to shell them! In my medical practice, I have witnessedfirsthand that eating cashews dramatically increases inflammation, especially inpatients with rheumatoid arthritis. The cashew is part of the same family aspoison ivy; I doubt if you’d consider munching on that. There are plenty oftasty nuts on the “yes, please” list—stick to those and your body will thankyou. And if you are a die-hard peanut butter fan, rest assured that its tastiercousin, almond butter, is part of the Plant Paradox program.CORNLike nearly all other grains, corn (which is not a vegetable, but a grain) has ahigh lectin content. And since corn is one of the biggest crops and most commonfood additives—think corn syrup, cornstarch, corn flakes and other breakfastcereals, corn chips—the typical American eats some form of corn multiple times aday.QUINOAThis New World pseudo-grain is hailed as a gluten-free substitute to wheat, butit is so loaded with lectins that it is no friend to your digestive tract,immune system, or waistline. Ancient Incas, who made quinoa part of their diet,first soaked it and then fermented it before cooking in an effort to reduce itspotential toxicity—two instructions you’ll rarely ever see on the side of a boxof quinoa.CONVENTIONALLY RAISED MEATIt’s not difficult to see why corn is among the worst lectin-filled grains. Justlook at the American farm industry. Farmers use corn for the sole purpose offattening up cattle. And, guess what? Corn has the same effect on us. Not onlythat, it causes fatty deposits in the muscle. So, avoid “free-range” meats andchicken. “Free-range” means the cattle and chicken are eating corn and,therefore, so are you. Instead, opt for only pasture-raised meats and chicken.VEGETABLE OILSYou may have heard that vegetable oils are healthier for you than other oils,but most of them are made from high-lectin beans or seeds: corn oil, soybeanoil, and sunflower oil are all potent sources of lectins. Worse, much of thecorn and the soybeans used to make this oil are genetically modified, meaningthey have been bred to produce extra-strength lectins that help make them moreresistant to insects. On top of this, the fats in these vegetable oils areprimarily omega-6 fats, meaning these oils deliver a double-dose of inflammationwhen you consume them. Finally, I’ll say it again, all these oils come fromgrains or seeds sprayed with Roundup, so it too ends up in you!LEGUMES AND BEANSBeans, peas, soybeans, lentils, and other legumes (also known as pulses) havethe highest lectin content of any food group. Is it any wonder that they arealso renowned for their ability to cause gas, bloating, and indigestion?! Iknow, I know—beans have been hailed as a mainstay of a healthy diet for decadesnow, particularly if you eat a vegan or vegetarian diet. Don’t get me wrong, Iam not against grains and beans! I’m just against eating them without firsttaming their inflammatory effects. You can dramatically reduce the lectincontent of beans and legumes by pressure-cooking them.DAIRYDairy products made from the milk of most North American cows—even those thatare grass-fed and organically raised—contain the lectin-like protein casein A1.The only approved dairy products on this plan are those outlined here[9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#page_30], which include products made from goat,sheep, and water buffalo milk as well as cow’s milk from Southern European cows.The good news here is that coconut milk—the kind that comes in a can as well asthe kind that comes in a carton as a milk alternative—makes a great substitutefor that creamy dairy taste in soups, ice creams, and other foods.NIGHTSHADESThis popular family of plants includes potatoes, peppers (bell as well as hotpeppers like chili and jalapeño), eggplants, goji berries, and tomatoes—all ofwhich contain a heaping helping of lectins, in addition to the glycoalkoidpoison solanine, a known neurotoxin.22 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en22] Theyare all high in lectins, particularly in their seeds and peels, and thereforeunfriendly to your health.SQUASHESWith the exception of cucumbers, which first originated in Asia and then madetheir way to Africa and Europe via trade routes, the squash family—fruits withpeels and seeds that grow on vines, including pumpkins, acorn squash, zucchini,and butternut squash—is native to the Americas. Meaning, it contains lectinsthat humans have only been exposed to in the last five hundred years or so. Inaddition to containing lectins, all varieties of squash contain sugars that cueyour body to store weight in preparation for winter.

on the “no” list that can be made relatively okay in termsof lectins—if you prepare them properly. While I don’t advocate eating any ofthese foods on a regular basis, you can include them in your diet occasionallyas long as they don’t seem to cause you problems (digestive upset, achiness,brain fog, rashes, et cetera).BEANS AND LENTILSFor my vegan and vegetarian readers, especially, I know how important beans canbe in terms of a go-to, fiber-packed, protein-rich food. However, they areloaded with lectins. In fact, beans are some of the highest-lectin foods thereare. The good news is that cooking them in a pressure cooker all but eradicatesthe lectins in beans and other legumes (as well as many whole grains, but I’llget to that in just a moment). Once those pesky lectins are out of the way,beans become the “healthy” food they’re often billed as, because your gutbuddies love to feast on their fiber.So if you want to eat beans often, I recommend investing in an Instant Pot orother pressure cooker (modern iterations of this cooking tool are a far cry fromthe early versions, which had an unfortunate habit of occasionally exploding).Yet another bonus of pressure-cooking is that it produces perfectly cooked beansin a fraction of the time it takes to cook them on the stove.If you buy canned beans, I highly suggest you purchase the Eden Foods brand.They pressure-cook their beans right in the cans (which are BPA-free).Fermentation is another preparation method that dramatically reduces lectincount. If you want to experiment with this age-old technique, fermenting lentilshas been shown to reduce their lectin content by 98 percent.23[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en23]WHEAT AND RICEWheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is found in wheat bran, meaning that whole wheatbread has it, but white bread doesn’t. And WGA is a dastardly lectin—a muchsmaller protein than other lectins, WGA can sneak through the gut wall even ifyour gut barrier is fairly healthy. Once freed from your digestive tract and inyour bloodstream, WGA can wreak all kind of havoc—including triggering fatstorage, causing neurological problems, and contributing to atherosclerosis. Thepositive spin on WGA is that it means that delicious, fluffy white bread,naturally raised with yeast or sourdough starters, is actually better for youthan the whole wheat/whole grain stuff we think of as “healthy”! By the sametoken, the bran on rice that makes it brown contains lectins, meaning white riceis actually better for you than the brown rice you’ve been told is a wiserchoice. While I don’t recommend eating wheat or rice, per se, if you’re going toeat it, eating the de-hulled versions will reduce your lectin exposure. So let’shear it for white bread and white rice! If you’re going to eat white bread, tomake it even more friendly to your gut wall (and lower in lectins), opt forsourdough, as fermentation also helps reduce lectin content. But let me be veryclear: if you have an autoimmune disease or suspect you have one or have afamily history, there is no safe wheat bread! And please, pressure-cook yourwhite rice.There’s no point in trying to pressure-cook wheat in an effort to make it moredigestible: one lectin that pressure-cooking doesn’t remove is gluten. For thatreason, there’s also no health benefit to pressure-cooking rye, barley, or oats(the other gluten-containing whole grains; even gluten-free oats contain agluten look-alike lectin).TOMATOES, PEPPERS, EGGPLANTS, CUCUMBERS, ZUCCHINIYes, all of these foods are nightshades, which fall under “just say no” on mylist. But. I know how much people love these foods. Fresh tomatoes arescrumptious and I realize that folks who live in colder climates look forward totomato season all year long. To make them more digestible, try to stick toheirloom varieties (which have been around longer than most standard varieties,and thus our microflora and digestive tracts have had at least a smidge moretime to acclimate to them) and peel and seed them before you eat them. The bestway to peel a tomato is to cut a shallow X on the bottom of them, then drop themin boiling water for a few seconds to loosen the skin. Take them out of thewater, let them cool, and then the skin will come right off. Then quarter thetomato and scoop the seeds right out. The blanching doesn’t affect the taste.The same goes for peppers of all kinds—peeling and seeding makes them infinitelymore digestible. It’s easy enough to seed them; to peel them, I like to brieflyroast them either on the grill or directly on the burner of my stove until theskin blisters, making it easy to peel off after putting them in a paper bag fora few minutes to steam.When it comes to cucumbers, zucchini, and eggplants—if you choose to eat thesefoods, peel them and seed them if possible. “Baby” versions of these foods areoften easier to work with because they contain fewer seeds. When shopping foreggplants, look for those that have a round bottom as opposed to an ovalbottom—they are thought to contain fewer seeds.24[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en24]Fun fact: Americans and Europeans actively shunned tomatoes up until themid-1800s when Colonel Robert Johnson publicly ate a basket of tomatoes on theSalem, New Jersey, courthouse steps to prove that he wouldn’t die or go insane(neither of which happened), so feared were these deadly nightshades.“Health” Foods That Aren’t Actually HealthyI know how frustrating it is to try to stay on top of which foods are currentlyconsidered “healthy” and which aren’t, as the guidelines always seem to bechanging. I suspect, though, that you will be relieved to see that many of thefoods you’ve been encouraged to eat because they are allegedly “healthy” aren’tactually doing you any favors.Below is a list of so-called “health” foods that really aren’t so healthy, aswell as the healthier (and oftentimes tastier, in my opinion) alternatives.“HEALTH” FOODBETTER ALTERNATIVE“HEALTH” FOODBETTER ALTERNATIVEWHOLE WHEAT BREADwhite bread or, even better, sourdough white breadbrown ricewhite riceTOFUtempehbeans and lentilspressure-cooked beans and lentilsPEANUT BUTTERalmond buttercanola, sunflower, or safflower oilsolive oil, coconut oil, or avocado oilPEANUTS AND CASHEWSwalnuts, pistachios, macadamiasmilk and cow’s milk cheesegoat’s milk, goat cheese and cheeses made from sheep’s milkFREE-RANGE POULTRY AND EGGSpastured poultry and eggsraw peppersroasted, peeled, and seeded peppersYOGURTcoconut yogurt or goat’s milk yogurt (unsweetened)quinoamilletThe Truth About Animal ProteinAs you probably know, protein is an important macronutrient; your body needsprotein to create energy and to maintain muscle. The amino acids in protein arethe building blocks of the cells and tissues in the human body—they areliterally the stuff we’re made of. But here’s the thing about protein: you needa lot less of it of it than you probably think you need. And if you’re currentlyeating a typical American diet, or adhering to a Paleo, Whole30, or low-carbeating plan, chances are you’re eating way too much of it.I know what you might be thinking—if protein is so essential, how is it possibleto eat too much of it? Well, any protein that your body doesn’t need right awaygets converted into glucose by the liver. Glucose gets stored as fat. It alsoraises blood sugar levels and insulin levels, and that can lead to a whole hostof chronic diseases. On top of that, some of the amino acids in meat appear tobe growth agents for cancer and accelerators of aging.25[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en25]To meet your body’s needs, you only need 0.37 grams of protein per kilogram ofbody weight.26 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en26] A kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.So, if you weigh 150 pounds, you only need about 25 grams of protein each day.If you weigh 125 pounds, it’s 21 grams. To find your target protein allotment,multiply your weight by 2.2 to see how much you weigh in kilograms. Thenmultiply that number by .37 and you’ve got your answer.To give you an idea of what 20 grams of protein looks like on your plate, ittranslates to roughly three ounces of animal protein—about the size of a deck ofcards—one Quest bar, or two and a half eggs. When it comes to animal protein, Iwant you to keep this phrase in mind: “One and you’re done.” You really don’tneed to have it at every meal. Have one full portion a day, or spread itthroughout the day—say, one egg in the morning, a scoop of goat cheese on yoursalad at lunch, and a few pieces of shrimp at dinner.Plants contain less protein than animals, but if you’re eating a mostlyplant-based diet, it adds up pretty quickly. Half a cup of steamed cauliflowercontains one gram of protein, a medium baked sweet potato provides about twograms, and an artichoke has about four grams.Intermittent FastingI love to talk about what to eat—and what to avoid eating—in order to promoteyour health. But there’s another diet strategy that’s also important: not eatinganything. Or, in other words, fasting. Let’s go back to thinking aboutevolution: our ancestors fasted regularly. Not because it was trendy, butbecause food simply wasn’t always available. Your body is designed to not onlywithstand periods without food, but to thrive because of them. Over thousands ofyears, our bodies adapted to be able to process and store energy based onintermittent periods of having access to food and not having access to food.Nowadays, we’ve got access out the wazoo, and it’s contributing to our obesityepidemic and high rates of chronic disease.Going without food from time to time gives your body a chance to process anddigest. It also naturally guides you to reduce your overall caloric intake. Andthere are many ways to do it.SOME OPTIONS INCLUDE: * Choosing two days a week to consume only 500–600 calories—many of my patients find that doing so on Mondays and Thursdays is pretty convenient and easy to do. Mondays, after all, you’re naturally ready to cut back after the laxness of the weekend, and Thursday you’ve had two days of eating normally behind you and the weekend to look forward to. My patients who follow this method tend to lose about a pound a week. * Try going sixteen hours between your last meal on the day before and your first meal of the next day. So, if you finish eating dinner at 6:00 p.m., don’t eat breakfast the next day until 10:00 a.m. Or, if you finish dinner at 8:00 p.m., don’t eat until noon the next day. * Adopt a seasonal intermittent fasting schedule. For example, from January to May of each year, I only eat between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. each day. Up until dinner, I drink plenty of green tea and mint tea, and have a cup of coffee each morning. I’ve been doing this for ten years, so I know it’s not only possible, it’s sustainable.Sample Breakfasts, Lunches, and DinnersI am throwing a lot of nutritional information at you in this chapter, and whilethe lists of “yes, please” and “no, thank you” foods make things pretty clear,sometimes it’s helpful to think about what a typical day of eating might looklike. So let’s pause for a moment to imagine a typical day on the Plant Paradoxplan.Let’s say it’s a busy weekday; you’ve got work and an event afterward. Forbreakfast, you can scramble two eggs in an ample amount of olive oil. If youwant something even quicker, you can grab a coconut-milk, goat-milk, orsheep-milk yogurt and toss in a handful of chopped walnuts or pecans. Or maybeyou’ll decide to intermittently fast and not eat until mid-late morning. For asnack, you can munch on some plantain chips, or eat half an avocado sprinkledwith sea salt (you can even eat it straight out of the peel with a spoon). Forlunch you can pack a thermos of leftover Dr. G’s Bean Chili[9780062843388_Recipe_28.xhtml#sec28] or Pressure Cooker Black Bean Soup withAvocado Salsa [9780062843388_Recipe_34.xhtml#sec34]. And for a fast dinner youcan use frozen cauliflower rice to make Cauliflower-Ginger Fried Rice[9780062843388_Recipe_57.xhtml#sec57] and top it off with a couple Dried Fig“Truffles” [9780062843388_Recipe_82.xhtml#sec82]. Not bad for a minimal amountof cooking, right?On a weekend, when you’ve got a bit more time, you can make yourself aSpanish-ish Omelet [9780062843388_Recipe_22.xhtml#sec22], or really go to townand whip up some Coconut Macadamia Waffles[9780062843388_Recipe_16.xhtml#sec16]. For lunch you might have a Banh Mi Bowl[9780062843388_Recipe_38.xhtml#sec38], and then for dinner make a hearty RootVegetable Lasagna [9780062843388_Recipe_56.xhtml#sec56] or Spinach ArtichokeLasagna [9780062843388_Recipe_55.xhtml#sec55].There are also plenty of fast, everyday type recipes in this cookbook—Dr. G’sPlant-Powered Coffee [9780062843388_Recipe_91.xhtml#sec91] that my wife and Istart most days with, for example, or my Dr. Gundry’s Nut Mix 2.0[9780062843388_Recipe_3.xhtml#sec3] that provides a grab-and-go snack that isdelicious and filling and that so many of my patients and readers report loving.While I recognize that you may look at the “no, thank you” list and think thatyou will never be able to find enough foods to eat to keep your belly full andpalate satisfied, I promise you, having a few boundaries is ultimatelyliberating. When you narrow your choices, it’s actually easier to decide what toeat. And once you start experiencing the benefits of eating fewer lectins—lessindigestion and bloating, more weight loss, more energy, and fewer aches andpains—you will not feel like you’re making any kind of sacrifice."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Three [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch3]image [../images/linech.jpg]The Plant Paradox Program [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch3]image [../images/linech.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"By this point in the book, you’re probably tired of the word “lectin.” You getit. You’ve read through lists of foods to eat and foods to avoid.The only piece of the puzzle left is putting together a structured eating planthat makes losing weight and healing your gut effortless.That’s where the Plant Paradox program comes in. This three-phase eating planprovides guidelines for what, how, and when to eat for either the next severalweeks or, if you become a convert to this lifestyle like so many of my patients,the rest of your life. The plan is designed to give your body a vacation fromthe foods that are harming it and provide space for your exquisitely designedhealing mechanisms to kick in.But I do want to be clear that you don’t need to follow this program to theletter. If you aren’t experiencing any health issues, by all means, skip thischapter and head straight to the recipes. I’m including the program here only sothat if, for example, you’ve loaned out your copy of The Plant Paradox to afriend (and they never returned it!), you have everything you need to take theinformation I covered at length in that book and run with it. My goal is toempower you with information and choices. To that end, here are the guidelinesof the Plant Paradox program.The Four RulesRULE #1 What You Remove from Your Diet Has a Far Bigger Impact on Your HealthThan What You Add to ItMost mainstream diet advice you’ll find—in a magazine article, say, or a blogpost—will use up a lot of words describing the miraculous health benefits of aparticular food or a specific nutrient that is found in a variety of foods.“Munch on macadamia nuts!” “Prioritize antioxidants!” “Eat more omega-3s!” Whilethese individual foods or nutrients may indeed be health-promoting, eating ahandful of them on top of a crappy diet isn’t going to work miracles. Thebenefit of any nutritious food is severely limited if the bulk of your diet issabotaging your health.I intentionally listed this rule first, because if you do nothing more thanremove from your diet the high-lectin foods on the “no” list, I practicallyguarantee that your health will improve dramatically. Your gut health is soimportant to every other facet of your well-being, it’s no wonder thatHippocrates stated “all disease begins in the gut.” Remove the foods that attackyour gut wall and wipe out your gut buddies, and your health will flourish.RULE #2 Take Care of Your Gut Buddies, and They Will Take Care of YouThe typical American has been waging an all-out war on his or her microbiome.Antibiotics, antacids, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,pesticide-laden foods, and a high-sugar, low-fiber diet all decimate yourfriendly microbes. When you stop eating the foods that wipe out your gutbuddies, they will thrive and grow in numbers. When that happens, they crowd outthe harmful bacteria and other “gang members” that have been running the showand making you sick. To take it one step further, when you start eating thefoods that feed your gut buddies (like many of those on the “yes, please” list[9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#yes] in Chapter 2) it’s like you become thesuperhero version of yourself—you become mentally sharper and more impervious todisease. To quote Bette Midler, your gut buddies become the wind beneath yourwings.When you give the bacteria the nutrients they need to thrive, they in turnsignal to your immune system that everything is cool—no need for an inflammatoryresponse. And the immune system isn’t the only system your gut buddies aretalking to—these bacteria communicate with your brain and with all yourmitochondria, which are energy-producing organelles located in every cell ofyour body. Remember, your body is literally a condominium for trillions of bugs,and the more you take care of your tenants, the more your tenants will take careof you.RULE #3 Fruit Might as Well Be CandyI know this idea is uncomfortable to accept; it runs counter to everythingyou’ve ever been told about fruit. But I implore you to reconsider fruit as“health food.” Does fruit contain nutrients? Yes. It contains some fiber, whichfeeds your gut buddies and promotes your digestion and elimination, andpolyphenols, which are naturally-occurring compounds with antioxidantproperties. Can you find those nutrients in other food sources? For the mostpart, yes. There are some polyphenols, such as resveratrol, that are found onlyin specific fruits (in the case of resveratrol, it’s most plentiful in the skinof red grapes), but there are also plenty of polyphenols in greens andcruciferous vegetables.Let’s consider what else fruit contains: lectins and sugar. The peels and seedsof many fruits are typically loaded with lectins, particularly if they have beenpicked before fully ripening. Remember, fruit isn’t just what you typicallythink of—apples, oranges, berries, bananas, et cetera—it’s anything thatcontains seeds, including tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplants (all of which are adouble whammy: nightshades and fruits). And the sugar content of fruit istroublesome. In addition to cueing your body to store fat for the winter, thesugar in fruit is fructose, and fructose is the preferred form of fuel forcancer cells.27 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en27] All sugar, including thesugar in fruit, also causes an immediate spike in blood sugar and insulin, whichtriggers an inflammatory response from your immune system. I think of eating abowl of fruit for breakfast as the nutritional equivalent of eating a bowl ofSkittles—that’s how much I believe the health benefits of fruit have beenoverrated.If you’re a fruit lover, it’s not all bad news. Remember, there are severalfruits that are fine to eat: bananas, papayas, and mangoes are a part of theplan, as long as you consume them when they are unripe (green). These unripefruits are a great source of resistant starches, and resistant starches are afeast for your gut buddies. You may cringe at the thought of eating a greenbanana, but green banana flour is a great grain substitute in pancakes and bakedgoods. And sliced green mango and papaya are great additions to salads. (You mayalso recognize green papaya salad from Thai and Vietnamese restaurant menus—itis tangy and so refreshing!) There are also some fruits on the “yes, please”list of foods that are okay to eat in small amounts when they are in season.Finally, the pulp of fruit and the skin of ripe fruit have the most benefits:get out your juicer, juice your favorite fruits, throw out the juice (yes, pourit down the drain), and eat the pulp and skin that is in the discard bucket!Freeze it in ice cube trays and add a cube or two to your next smoothie.And there is one fruit you can eat in its ripe stage as much as you please: ourdear friend the avocado. With nary a trace of sugar and plenty of good fat andsoluble fiber, it’s the best fruit you can eat!RULE #4 You Are What the Thing You Are Eating AteThis is an important consideration that so many otherwise health-minded folkslet slip by. You might choose your produce carefully and go grain-free, but ifyou’re eating animal protein that is anything other than pasture-raised, you’renot eating as cleanly as you think you are. Cows, pigs, and chickens that arefattened up on corn or soy or wheat ingest a lot of lectins in those foods; youconsume these lectins (along with other stuff, like antibiotics) when youconsume the animal. If you remove high-lectin foods from your diet but still eatconventionally raised animal protein or farmed fish or seafood, you’resabotaging yourself. Honestly, this was a hard one for even me to believe atfirst, but for so many of my patients, the final obstacle standing in their wayto great health was this one simple rule.______These are the broad strokes of the Plant Paradox program, and if you want torefine your efforts beyond simply removing the foods on the “No” list, these arethe principles that will help guide you back to a level of vitality you likelyhaven’t felt in years. The three-phase plan that follows is meant to beimplemented from start to finish—you begin at Phase 1, cycle through Phase 2,and complete Phase 3, or perhaps stay on Phase 3 forever. That said, if you’rein relatively good health already and aren’t looking to lose weight, you canskip the Phase 1 cleanse if you’d like.PHASE #1 A Three-Day Kick-Start CleanseImagine, if you will, your gut as an empty lot—a weed-infested, totallyovergrown, vines-choking-out-every-tree kind of empty lot—with a fencesurrounding it that is riddled with holes, so all manner of varmints have takenup residence in the scraggly environs. Got the picture?In order to transform this eyesore into a vibrant, beautiful, and thrivingecosystem, the first thing you’ve got to do is get rid of the weeds. In myexperience treating tens of thousands of patients, I have seen proof again andagain that if your gut is a breeding ground for unfriendly bacteria, yeast,fungi, and other gang members, it doesn’t matter how many healthy foods you eat;your body simply won’t be able to process them any more than organic seedsplanted in a completely overgrown field will sprout, grow, and thrive. You’vegot to make space for health to set in—and mend those holes in the fence of yourgut garden—by clearing out the invasive species that have taken over. Andaccording to many well-designed studies,28[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en28],29 [9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en29],30[9780062843388_Endnotes.xhtml#en30] your microbiome responds quickly to a changein diet, meaning that a short-term dietary shake-up (like Phase 1) is aneffective way to immediately change the makeup of your gut’s bacterialpopulation.From here, because you won’t want those icky bad guys to reassert themselves,you’ll want to move right into Phase 2. Meaning, if you think you can do athree-day cleanse and then go back to your old eating habits, and stillexperience lasting benefits to your health, you’re wrong. (Bummer, I know.) Icall Phase 1 a kick-start because it lays the foundation for the eatingstrategies you’ll employ in Phase 2 to show their benefits more quickly. ButPhase 1 is optional. If you choose to jump right into Phase 2, just be patient,as it will probably take a bit longer for you to notice results.There are three parts to Phase 1:PART 1: Do not eat any dairy, grains (including pseudo-grains such as quinoa),fruit, sugar, seeds, eggs, soy, nightshades, roots, or tubers. No corn, soy, orcanola oils, or any form of beef or conventionally-raised meats. Removing thesefoods will help quell inflammation and starve your unfriendly microbes.Basically, you eat nothing but organic vegetables from the “yes, please” list,as well as avocado and small amounts of wild-caught fish, pastured chicken,tempeh, shellfish, hemp tofu, or certain Quorn products (listed on the “yes,please” list), and healthy fats and approved nuts.Just for Phase 1 and the first two weeks of Phase 2, also avoid extra-virginolive oil and coconut oil because they allow lipopolysaccharides (LPS), abacterial cell wall component that closely resembles the chemical structure oflectins, to hitch a ride through the gut wall where they then trigger an immuneresponse—and you don’t want to give your body any extra work to do during thistime. Instead, use macadamia nut oil, walnut oil, avocado oil, ghee, MCT oil, orperilla oil (a popular cooking oil in Asia that’s available in Asian markets, atWhole Foods, and from online sources). You can drink all the water and black andgreen tea (sweetened only with stevia) you’d like. Appropriate recipes for thisphase include Garlic-and-Walnut-Stuffed Mushrooms[9780062843388_Recipe_10.xhtml#sec10], Ralph’s Breakfast Scramble[9780062843388_Recipe_14.xhtml#sec14] (the vegan version), Lemon, Kale, andChicken Soup [9780062843388_Recipe_30.xhtml#sec30], and Tangy Coconut Greens[9780062843388_Recipe_73.xhtml#sec73].PART 2: Optionally, you can assist in your body’s efforts to get rid of any“weeds” in your gut by taking a gentle laxative. I recommend an herbal blendcalled Swiss Kriss, which has an active ingredient of senna. It is available atmost pharmacies and online. Take two tablets at bedtime along with a glass ofwater the night before you start Phase 1 (you only need to do this on the firstday, no need to repeat on days 2 and 3). Oh, by the way, it helps to be home thenext morning, as Swiss Kriss tends to work quickly.PART 3: If you suffer from digestive disorders such as IBS, leaky gut, or anyautoimmune condition, consider taking supplements that aid in killing unfriendlygut bugs, including: berberine (found in Oregon grape root extract), grapefruitseed extract (not grape-seed extract), and mushroom extracts. I provide specificdosage information in the Resources [9780062843388_Resources.xhtml#page_267]section at the back of the book. Spices that help support digestive healinginclude black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and wormwood, so be sure to use these inyour cooking or consume them as a supplement.You may feel hungry, cranky, or tired during these seventy-two hours. I willprobably not be your favorite person during this time! But at the end of yourthree days, you should have lost a few pounds (up to 4 is typical) and reducedyour inflammation to the point that you notice you don’t feel as achy. Yourbalance of gut bacteria should also be tilted much more toward the friendly guysoutnumbering the unfriendly ones.Remember, despite starting to feel better, reverting back to your old foodhabits will only tip the scale back in favor of the unfriendly bacterial andfungal domination, so on the morning of Day 4, head straight into Phase 2.PHASE #2 Repair and Restore for Six WeeksIn this phase of the program, you are basically retraining your eating habits sothat you create a healthy digestive environment that continues to nurture yourgut buddies and doesn’t let the bad guys come roaring back and take over theplace. If Phase 1 was about pulling the weeds in the overgrown garden of yourdigestive tract, Phase 2 is about nurturing the soil and rebuilding the fencesthat keep unwelcome critters out of your crops. In my experience, it takespeople six weeks to fully establish a new habitual eating pattern; for thatreason, Phase 2 of the Plant Paradox program lasts for six weeks.I know how hard it is to break old patterns and addictive behaviors. What islikely to happen on this phase of the plan is that a couple weeks in, you willstart to feel great. Your clothes will be looser, your energy will soar, and youmay be tempted to start thinking, “I’m now so healthy that I can go back toeating whatever I want.” Please, I beg you—stick with this part of the programfor a full six weeks. Even though the benefits that you’ll start feeling arereal, it takes time to seal up those holes in your gut wall; the bad guys arelooking for any opportunity to regain the upper hand. You’ve got to show them nomercy and starve them out—it’s the best way to give yourself the healing youneed and deserve.In this phase of the plan, you’ll continue to avoid everything on the “no, thankyou” list [9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#no], steer clear of all fruit exceptfor those allowed on Phase 1, avoid cow’s milk dairy as much as possible(although coconut milk and yogurt are okay; as are milk, cheese, and yogurt madefrom sheep and goat milk so long as you don’t overdo them because they docontain Neu5Gc), and omit beans and tofu and other unfermented soy products (foreveryone, but this is of particular note if you are a vegetarian or a vegan—I’llgive some specific guidance for my non-meat-eating friends at the end of thischapter). As with Phase 1, for the first two weeks of Phase 2, limit yourconsumption of coconut oil and olive oil. Since we’re trying to coolinflammation as much as possible during this early phase of the program, easingoff these oils will help you meet that goal, at least for now. After two weekson Phase 2, you can begin to add these oils back into your normal rotation.You are free to consume up to eight ounces of animal protein a day (only frompastured animals, omega-3 eggs, or wild-caught seafood, preferably in twofour-ounce portions a day—about the size of the palm of your hand), but I wouldprefer that you eat less of these proteins. You should also maximize yourresistant starch intake to fuel your rehabbed gut buddies—plantains, sweetpotatoes or yams, taro root, shirataki noodles (a tasty pasta alternative foundin the grocery store refrigerator case), parsnips, turnips, jicama, celery root,Jerusalem artichokes (also known as sunchokes), as well as green mangoes,papayas, and bananas. Other foods that help feed your friendly bacteria areradicchio, Belgian endive, okra, artichokes, onions, garlic, and mushrooms—theyprovide an indigestible (to humans) sugar called inulin that good bacteria love.Your gut buddies also love leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, so continueto eat plenty of these (as you did in Phase 1). Like I mentioned in Rule 4,another surprising way to feed your gut buddies the polyphenols they lovewithout also delivering a healthy dose of sugars that the bad bacteria love isto get out your fruit juicer and use it in reverse—throw the juice away and eatthe pulp that’s left behind. You can add it to a smoothie, stir it into somecoconut, goat, or sheep yogurt, or mix it into your salad dressing. Nuts are agreat snack for this phase, particularly polyphenol-rich pistachios, walnuts,macadamias, and pecans, up to a half cup a day. Fresh or dried figs (which aretechnically a flower and not a fruit) and dates are good sources of the fibersonly your good gut buddies love, and are great to use in limited amounts whenyou need a sweet boost—add them to salads or smoothies.Some of the recipes that you can enjoy in Phase 2 include Cheesy CauliflowerMuffins [9780062843388_Recipe_15.xhtml#sec15], Chocolate Chip Mini-Pancakes[9780062843388_Recipe_17.xhtml#sec17], Beef and Mushroom Stew[9780062843388_Recipe_35.xhtml#sec35], Shrimp Poke Bowl[9780062843388_Recipe_40.xhtml#sec40], and Creamy Shrimp and Kale Spaghetti[9780062843388_Recipe_44.xhtml#sec44].In addition, in Phase 2 you’ll start taking a fish oil capsule—one that containsthe highest number of milligrams of DHA that you can afford. Ideally you’llconsume a total 1,000 mg of DHA a day—either before each meal or by mixingflavored cod liver oil with a healthy oil from the “yes, please” list. If you’rea vegan or vegetarian, take an algal DHA capsule instead. The other vitalsupplement to add to your daily regimen is Vitamin D3. Aim for taking 5,000 to10,000 IUs a day, unless you are working with a health-care provider who ismonitoring your levels and counseling you to take more. In my fifteen years ofpracticing restorative medicine, I have regularly prescribed up to anastonishing 40,000 IUs a day to get vitamin D levels up to at least 70 ng/ml,which is what I consider to be the floor of a healthy baseline (I keep mylevels, and those of my autoimmune and cancer patients, greater than 100 ng/ml).The final piece of the puzzle here is to stop taking—if possible, and with theguidance of your health-care provider, of course—any prescription drugs thatdisrupt your microbiome, including antibiotics, stomach-acid-blocking drugs(replace with Rolaids, Tums, DGL, or marshmallow root), and NSAIDS (such asibuprofen and naproxen; replace with Tylenol or boswellia extract).PHASE #3 Reap the RewardsWhen my patients come to see me after they’ve been on the Plant Paradox programfor at least six weeks (whether or not they jump-started with a Phase 1cleanse), I see and hear all kinds of amazing things. They’ve lost excess weightor gained a few pounds if they were underweight. If they’ve been suffering fromarthritis or an autoimmune condition, they marvel at how much their chronic painhas dissipated. Their digestion is improved and any constipation or diarrhea hasrectified itself. They also understand that they haven’t merely completed adiet; they have changed their bodies for the better—and they want to keepfeeling good.In this final phase of the Plant Paradox program, you can start to reintroducecertain lectin-containing foods—with proper preparation. Doing so not onlyexpands your food choices, it gives you a chance to fully understand just howmuch your gut has healed and your gut buddies have resumed control of yourintestines and your immune system. You don’t have to make this shift exactly atthe six-week mark—if you are feeling great and don’t want to modify your eatingplan, by all means, keep going until you feel some natural desire to changethings up.If any of the following conditions haven’t been met, I encourage you to keepgoing with Phase 2 until they are resolved: * Bowel movements have become regular * Joints have stopped hurting * Brain fog has receded * Skin has cleared * Energy has risen noticeably * Sleep has improved * Weight has normalizedSome of you are simply more sensitive to lectins than others. If you arehypothyroid, have arthritis or heart disease, have a diagnosed autoimmunedisease, have had your tonsils or appendix removed, or have chronic sinusissues, I advise you to stick to Phase 2; you wouldn’t want to neutralize thehealth benefits you’ve just spent six weeks cultivating with one serving ofbeans, would you?The majority of you reading this, however, are not canaries. So when you feelready to start reintroducing some foods, consider yourself on Phase 3 of thePlant Paradox program. Honestly, this phase can last a lifetime, as it is moreof a lifestyle than a diet.Continuing with the foods you ate and strategies you implemented in Phase 2, atthis point you can start eating more coconut oil, introducing “baby” versions oflectin-containing foods such as cucumbers, zucchini, and Japanese eggplant(because these immature versions contain few or no seeds), as well as peeled andseeded heirloom tomatoes and peppers. Next comes pressure-cooked beans andlentils in small amounts. If you tolerate those well, then try small servings ofpressure-cooked white basmati rice (preferably from India) or pressure cookedpseudo-grains like quinoa. In terms of timing, reintroduce no more than one newfood a week so that you can assess the effect each has on you and yourmicrobiome. If you can pinpoint one or two troublesome foods by watching yourbowel movements, your joints, your skin, and your mood, you can take extra careto avoid them while enjoying some of the other new foods that don’t cause anegative reaction.In general, you want to continue to reduce your consumption of beef, pork, orlamb (even though it’s pastured or wild) because of its Neu5Gc content; Isuggest working toward a maximum of two ounces a day. Then start reducing theother safer animal proteins like fish and chicken. Remember, nuts, leaves, andmushrooms all have plenty of protein to meet your body’s needs. Every time youworry about getting enough protein from leaves, check out the muscles on agorilla or a horse!You also want to keep your fruit intake to a very moderate amount, and limit itto either unripe fruit or fruit that is in season, and then remove the peels andseeds of the fruit you do consume. I also recommend you limit your intake ofacceptable dairy from goat, sheep, and Southern European cows (see the “yes,please” list [9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#yes2]), because they also containNeu5Gc. And as much as your gut buddies love the resistant starches in tubers,if you over-rely on these foods they will lead to weight gain, so keep yourplate filled mostly with vegetables and limit resistant starches to a supportingrole—not the star of the show. You also want to develop your habits around goinglonger between meals and implementing intermittent fasting (see chapter 2[9780062843388_Chapter_2.xhtml] for more information on this). Stick with thesupplement routine I outlined for Phase 2, and to really send your healthsoaring, make a point of exposing yourself to more natural sunlight—an hour aday is the goal. Try for eight hours of sleep each night and get regularexercise. Block out blue light (from phones, computers, televisions, et cetera)at night and avoid the endocrine disruptors we discussed earlier[9780062843388_Chapter_1a.xhtml#page_10]. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Foods for Each Phase of the Plant Paradox ProgramTo make it as simple as possible to know when to eat which foods, I’ve compiledthis at-a-glance list of acceptable foods for each phase of the Plant Paradoxprogram.PHASE 1leafy green vegetables—endive, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and watercresscruciferous vegetables—bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage,cauliflower, kale, and mustard greensartichokesasparagusceleryfennelradishesfresh herbs including mint, parsley, basil, and cilantrogarlic, onions, leeks, and chiveskelp, seaweed, and noriwild-caught seafood or pastured poultry, no more than a total of eight ounces adayQuorn products (see list of “yes, please” foods[9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#yes] for acceptable options)tempeh (grain-free version)hemp tofuavocado, up to one a dayolivesavocado oil, macadamia nut oil, walnut oil, hemp seed oil, flaxseed oil, MCToil, perilla oil, gheenuts (see “yes, please” food list [9780062843388_Chapter_2a.xhtml#yes] forspecific types)lemon juicevinegarmustardgreen, black, or herbal teacoffeestevia or Just Like SugarPHASE 2All of the foods listed for Phase 1, plus:moderate amounts of in-season fruit or green bananas, mangoes, or papayaspastured or omega-3 eggsplantainsshirataki noodles (sold under the brand name Miracle Noodles)parsnipsturnipsjicamacelery rootJerusalem artichokes (sunchokes)sweet potatoesalmond flourcassava flourcoconut floursorghummilletinulin and yacón syrupokraradicchiomushrooms, raw or cookedplain goat, sheep, or coconut yogurtfigsdatesextra-virgin olive oil and coconut oil, after two weeks on Phase 2PHASE 3All the foods on the Phase 1 and Phase 2 lists, plus:peeled and seeded baby cucumbers, zucchini, and Japanese eggplants, adding themone at a time to your diet and making sure you don’t experience any adverseeffects before trying another onepeeled and seeded heirloom tomatoes and peppers, testing one at a time todetermine how they affect youpressure-cooked beans and lentilspressure-cooked Indian white basmati ricecasein A2 dairy—milk and cheese from goats, sheep, water buffalo, and SouthernEuropean cowswhite sourdough bread (do not eat if you have or have had an autoimmune disease,diabetes, prediabetes, or cancer)—use only as a sponge to get olive oil intoyour mouth-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A Note for Vegetarians and VegansI want to be very clear: I am pro-vegetarian and vegan, and so is the PlantParadox program. After all, I was a professor at the Loma Linda UniversitySchool of Medicine, which is a Seventh-Day Adventist vegetarian institution, forsixteen years. I have also studied the research into the blue zones—the areas ofthe world where people live the longest, as portrayed in journalist DanBuettner’s book The Blue Zones—and have taken to heart that these diets advocateeating far less animal protein than is standard in the American diet. And yet,here I am, advocating that you don’t eat many staples of a vegetarian diet,including rice, beans, tofu, and pasta. What gives?When you look more closely at the dietary similarities between the inhabitantsof the blue zones, you realize that they don’t rely on whole grains and beans asmuch as many people assume. If you look at the diets of Okinawans, for example,70 percent of their calories come from a purple sweet potato. Six percent oftheir diet is white rice, another 6 percent is soy (in the forms of tofu andmiso), and the rest was a smattering of pork and vegetables. In the Seventh-DayAdventist community in Loma Linda, 50 percent of their calories come from fat,regardless if they are vegetarian or vegan. Their main protein source is TVP(texturized vegetarian protein), a defatted soy protein, which ispressure-cooked and extruded under high pressure and heat. Remember this: theAdventists use pressure-cooked “beans.” In Acciaroli, Italy, a newly discoveredblue zone, most of their calories come from olive oil, anchovies, and rosemary;they eat minimal meat and grain, and have a higher concentration of people overone hundred than any other place in the world. By the way, they also drink redwine every day and smoke like fiends.I believe that the main reason why people in the blue zones live longer isbecause they eat a low percentage of animal protein, and not necessarily thehigh percentage of grains and beans that pro-bean and -grain proponents claimthey eat. You really do want to moderate your meat and animal productconsumption (including eggs and cheese)—no matter how well the animals wereraised—because all animal protein ages us. As explained previously, animalprotein contains a sugar molecule called Neu5Gc, which makes our immune systemattack the lining of our blood vessels, contributing to heart disease andcancer. In addition, and this is really bizarre, cancer cells use Neu5Gc to hidefrom the immune system. It’s a cloaking device—when we look at the chemicalcomposition of tumors, we see that they are full of Neu5Gc. Finally, certainamino acids that stimulate the aging receptor mTOR are far more concentrated inanimal protein, including chicken and fish, as opposed to plant proteins. So,vegetarians and vegans, I want you to know that I consider you to be very muchahead of the game when it comes to staying as young as possible as you age. Butsadly, certain of your protein sources, unless properly prepared, are making yousicker rather than healthier.I don’t want to take away anyone’s beloved rice and beans. So long as yourespect that these plants never wanted to be eaten—or their babies to beeaten—and take steps to cook them properly (with a pressure cooker, whichdestroys lectins), you will be okay. I have been so impressed by my patients’stories of how their grandmothers in Brazil or Peru always used a pressurecooker to prepare beans, or rice, or quinoa, and that it was when my patientsstopped this “old-fashioned” practice that they became ill. It turns out Grandmaknew a thing or two. With the lectins removed, beans offer a delicious feast ofsoluble fiber and resistant starch for your gut buddies. With just a little bitof knowledge and wise choices, you can eat moderate quantities of beans andlegumes starting in Phase 2. Rice should probably wait until Phase 3, but it tooisn’t off the table. The only thing that really should stay off your plate forthe long term are wheat, rye, barley, and oats, as pressure-cooking does notdestroy their lectin content.Plant Paradox Program for Life: A New Food PyramidNow that you’re ready to incorporate the Plant Paradox as a long-term lifestyle,let’s talk less about lists and more about what the overall composition of yourdiet should look like moving forward. To that end, I’ve created a quick and easyreference for you: the Plant Paradox Food Pyramid.At first glance, it looks very similar to the standard food pyramid created bythe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion,which I’ve included below my pyramid just to refresh your memory.It has the same triangular shape and shows you which foods to eat the most ofand which foods to eat sparingly. But that is where the similarities end.Whereas the USDA’s food pyramid will put on you a fast track to digestiveailments, chemical contamination, and a host of diseases, the Plant Paradox FoodPyramid will help you find and maintain your ideal weight and dramaticallyreduce the inflammation at the root of so many chronic diseases. If you’d liketo print out a copy to hang on your fridge (as opposed to tearing out a page ofthis beautiful book), visit:gundrymd.com/wp-content/pdf/Gundry_Food_Pyramid.pdf.image [../images/f0053-01.jpg]What’s so wrong with the standard food pyramid? Well, for starters, look at thefoundation of it—it suggests you eat primarily grains in the form of bread,pasta, cereal, and more bread. Because these items are so highly processed, thisis one of the food groups that is mostly like to contain dastardly foodadditives and deadly disruptors.For instance, bread products often contain added preservatives and ingredientslike food dyes, high-fructose corn syrup, or even the dangerous chemicalazodicarbonamide—aka the yoga-mat chemical. That’s the material put in sandalsand yoga mats to give them cushion; it was put in bread for years as a bleachingagent or to make the bread fluffy.Beyond that, the old food pyramid makes it seem like eating eleven slices ofbread is not only okay, but health promoting. By the way, Sardinians (one of theBlue Zones) do eat up to eleven slices of bread a day, but they have the highestincidence of autoimmune disease in Europe! And since wheat flour is loaded withlectins such as gluten and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), it attacks our gut walland cues the storage of belly fat.Perhaps the biggest difference between my food pyramid and the standard USDAmodel is this first, foundational level. As you can see, I don’t have grainsanywhere near the bottom of the pyramid. Rather, I advise that you make themajor components of your diet healthy fats, leafy greens, and cruciferousvegetables. These foods are so supportive of health that you can consume them inunlimited quantities. They include: * extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil * avocados * romaine, red and green leaf lettuce, kohlrabi, mesclun (baby greens), spinach, endive, butter lettuce, parsley, fennel, seaweed/sea vegetables * broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, cabbage, asparagus, and radishesThe second level of the food pyramid is perhaps the most mind-blowingpart—because it doesn’t contain any food at all! Rather, I suggest that you finda way to incorporate intermittent fasting into your regular eating schedule,whether that’s eating each day only during a compressed window of time (betweenthe hours of 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., say), or restricting your intake to 500or so calories for one or two days a week, or whatever strategy works best foryou. Because our bodies adapted to regular cycles of feasting and famine as ourspecies evolved, it actually benefits us to go without food from time to time.Intermittent fasting is one of the keys to overall health, and that’s the reasonit’s the second pillar of the pyramid.The third tier of the Plant Paradox Food Pyramid consists of nuts, flouralternatives, and lectin-free grains. This is where you can satisfy those grainand bread cravings. And yes, it’s okay to indulge in this category daily, butmake sure to limit consumption of these foods to small portions per meal. Withcassava flour, almond flour, tapioca flour, and coconut flour, you can recreatemany of your favorite baked goods. And with sorghum and millet, two lectin-freegrains, you can make alternatives for favorite dishes like stuffing andtabbouleh that fit the bill. Next, resistant starches make the list because theyfeed friendly bacteria. It’s okay to eat them every day, but limit the quantitywith each meal.You’ll notice that we had to get pretty high up the pyramid before we coveredany animal protein (although egg yolks are a good source of healthy fats—you canhave up to four of them a day, but ideally only one white; you can feed theextra egg whites to your dog or cat if you have one). The fourth tier of thepyramid includes wild-caught seafood, pastured poultry, and eggs. It alsocontains fruit, which should be regarded as a treat and eaten in moderation.It’s okay to eat a small portion of in-season fruit every day. Just considerthat, if you live in a cold climate, there will be several months out of theyear when no fruit is in season! Be very moderate with your fruit consumption,and your waistline will thank you. The only fruits that are okay to eatyear-round are green bananas, mangoes, papayas, and the ever-faithful avocado.Up near the top of the pyramid is dairy made from Southern European cows, goats,sheep, and buffalo. These types of milk products are allowed because they’re theonly milks that contain casein A2 protein and not casein A1. Consider these milkproducts an indulgence and consume them only in moderate quantities.Also up at the top is grass-fed or pasture-raised meat from cows, pigs, venison,lamb, bison, and wild game. You want to eat only very small amounts of thesemeats because they contain Neu5Gc.At the very tipsy top of the pyramid are certain alcoholic beverages and darkchocolate. Up to one ounce of dark chocolate a day—at least 72 percent cacao—isfine. And red wine in moderation can actually help our health. Moderation inthis case means a max of four to six ounces per day, only with meals. And as Icovered in Chapter 2 [9780062843388_Chapter_2.xhtml], champagne and the darkerspirits (such as bourbon and rye) have some health benefits to impart as well.When you let this new pyramid be your guide, you have a simple graphicrepresentation of a paradigm for healthy living."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Four [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch4]image [../images/linech.jpg]The Plant Paradox Kitchen [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch4]image [../images/linech.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Success on any eating plan starts with having a well-stocked kitchen and pantrythat makes meal prep easy, quick, and enjoyable.When it comes to stocking your pantry, I’ve tried to keep it so that 90 percentof the ingredients I use are items you can find at Costco, Walmart, or a biggrocery store. In fact, while I was working on this list, I would often look upa Walmart in a town in the Midwest to make sure that an item was availablethere. I’ve found cassava flour and shirataki noodles at Walmart—you may besurprised what’s available if you take the time to look. While I do recommendnon-GMO and organic versions of foods whenever possible, I know that their addedexpense can make following the Plant Paradox program difficult for some people,so I urge you to just do your best.If you can’t find an ingredient at a reasonable price locally, I recommend goingonline and checking out Amazon or Thrive Market—a website that is a crossbetween Costco and Whole Foods, offering high-quality foods at lower prices fora yearly membership fee.It may also seem like you have to buy and acclimate your taste buds to a lot ofnew and different ingredients, but here’s a tip for you: If you want to startwith a smaller number of new-to-you ingredients, I advocate for almond flour,cassava flour, and coconut flour. With those three basic ingredients you canmake a ton of new recipes, and even swap these out for other alternative flours.Beyond that, I want to introduce you to some of the staples I turn to again andagain both for the recipes included here and in my own pantry. These are myfavorites, and once you start eating them regularly, I think they will becomeyour favorites too.Plant Paradox Pantry StaplesAlmond butter: I know what a comforting staple peanut butter can be for a lot ofpeople, but since peanuts are one of the highest-lectin foods out there, itdefinitely doesn’t have a place in the Plant Paradox pantry. In fact, it’s afood I argue everyone should avoid, whether you care about lectins or not.(Butters made out of cashews or sunflower seeds are no better, because those twofoods are also high in lectins.) But don’t panic, almond butter is every bit asdelicious and it’s low in lectins. Preferably you’ll spring for the organicversion made from raw nuts, but if that is prohibitive for your grocery budget,just be sure to avoid any almond butter that contains partially hydrogenatedoils (aka trans fats) and sweeteners of any type.Almond flour: This flour alternative is nothing more than finely ground almonds,preferably skinless or “blanched,” as there are lectins in the skins of almonds.Look for a product that uses non-GMO almonds; bonus points if they are organic.Store this versatile flour in the freezer to keep it fresh longer.Almond milk: This milk alternative has a nice flavor all on its own—avoidsweetened or flavored versions. As with almond butter and flour, non-GMO isbetter, and organic is best.Arrowroot flour: Arrowroot is an herb and this flour—also sometimes labeled“arrowroot starch”—is made from its root. It makes a great thickener, so you canuse it in sauces where you would normally use cornstarch. I also like to add itto waffle and pancake batter when using alternative flours, as it helps thebatter hold together.Avocado: These rich, creamy beauties are so healthful I advocate eating as muchas one whole one a day. The only hitch is that they need to be ripe when you’reready to eat them. In order to ripen an avocado more quickly, put them near yourgreen bananas, and if you’re really in a pinch, you can bake an avocado in a350-degree oven for 10 minutes to soften it up—the flavor won’t be perfect butthe texture will be right. Once they’re ripe, you can put them in the fridge tomake them last another day or two at most, or take them out of the skin, pureethem, and then freeze in a freezer bag. I prefer Haas avocados, which have adark green or black skin with a pebbly texture, but Florida avocados are goodtoo.Avocado mayonnaise: Most mayonnaise is made with low-quality, high-lectin andGMO soybean oil, or other vegetable oils that are also high in lectins such assafflower or canola oil. Mayonnaise made with avocado oil is your best bet,health-wise. Primal Kitchen makes a great avocado mayo that’s available throughThrive Market, or Chosen Foods Avocado Mayo is available at Costco.Avocado oil: With its high smoke point and mild taste, avocado oil is anexcellent all-around cooking oil. Costco and most supermarkets carry it.Baking powder, aluminum-free: Most baking sodas contain sodium aluminumphosphate or sodium aluminum sulfate, but aluminum is no friend to your health!Two aluminum-free brands to look for are Bob’s Red Mill and Rumford.Basmati rice: In Phase 3, it’s okay to start eating very moderate amounts ofrice; I recommend that you limit it to white basmati rice because it has thelowest lectin content and high levels of resistant starch of any rice. Look forrice from India, not Texas—remember, we want to eat foods that humans have beeneating for a long time, and Texas basmati rice is a very recent addition to thefood supply, and is an entirely different grain that has less of the resistantstarch you want in your rice.Cassava flour: Cassava flour comes from the root known as manioc, yucca, oryuca, and is full of resistant starch. It is also the key to fluffy gluten-freebaked goods. If you can’t find it in your local supermarket, Moon Rabbit andOtto’s Naturals brands are available on Amazon.Cauliflower rice: This savory side dish and building block of many of therecipes in this book isn’t actually rice at all—it’s finely chopped cauliflower.While you can easily make it yourself by pulsing cauliflower florets in a foodprocessor, buying it premade is incredibly convenient and cost effective. Lookfor it in the freezer section of Whole Foods, Costco, and Trader Joe’s, or freshin many mainstream grocery stores.Cayenne pepper: If you love a spicy kick, make sure to skip the red chiliflakes—which contain the skins and seeds of hot peppers—and stick to cayennepepper, which is made of ground pepper after it has been peeled and seeded. Thesame is true for paprika.Chocolate: When it comes to purchasing chocolate bars, look for at least 72percent cacao; there are many options available at regular grocery stores aswell as at Costco. Look for organic and fair trade chocolate bars whenever youcan, and limit your intake to one ounce or less per day. For baking, look for anunsweetened, high-cacao content chocolate, also at least 72 percent cacao. Someproducts go as high as 99 percent cacao; World Market sells a 99 percent cacaobaking chocolate that has a surprisingly sweet taste. Dagoba and Lily’s makeexcellent chocolate chips.Cocoa powder: Not to be confused with hot chocolate (“cocoa”), which is apre-sweetened mix that includes some cocoa powder and a lot of sugar, cocoapowder is simply ground cacao beans. Because on its own cocoa powder can befairly bitter (which is actually a good thing, as the flavor is a direct resultof all the polyphenols cacao contains), many cocoa powders contain potassiumbromate or potassium carbonate to neutralize the taste—and the healthbenefits—of the polyphenols. That means you want to skip Dutch process cocoapowder and look for the words “nonalkalized.” My favorite cocoa powders are madeby Dagoba or Scharffen Berger.Coconut aminos: A delicious replacement for soy and tamari, coconut aminosconsist of only two ingredients—organic coconut tree sap and organic sea salt.That’s it. See, soy’s a bean. So, soy sauce is a bean sauce. And beans, as youknow, are rife with lectins. Not to mention soy sauce contains wheat, and wheatcontains gluten—a pretty offending lectin. I say, skip the whole soy saucesection and use coconut aminos instead.Coconut cream: This is the rich, creamy part of coconut milk. There are two waysto buy it: you can look for a can of coconut cream (I like the Trader Joe’sbrand), just be sure to avoid brands with BPA-lined cans or added sugar. If youcan’t find cans of the cream, you can buy coconut milk and store it in therefrigerator overnight. The cream will rise to the top and harden—just scoop itout gently the next day.Coconut flour: Another great flour alternative, coconut flour helps you make awide variety of baked goods. It’s a bit denser than other flours, meaning itabsorbs more liquid than you might expect, so be sure to follow recipes for awhile until you get a better sense of how this flour works with otheringredients before you start experimenting. Some of my favorite brands are Bob’sRed Mill, Nutiva, and Let’s Do.Coconut milk: This is the milk alternative that’s sold either in therefrigerated dairy case in a cardboard carton or the beverage aisle in a TetraPak so that it can be stored at room temperature until you’re ready to use it.It has a richer consistency than other nondairy milks, meaning it makes a nicecreamy replacement. Look for unsweetened and unflavored versions.Coconut oil: A great cooking oil because of its high smoke point, coconut oilalso makes a great addition to baked goods. Look for extra-virgin coconut oilfrom brands such as Kirkland, Viva Labs, Carrington Farms, and Nature’s Way.Eggs: I love eggs—in fact, I advocate consuming the yolks more strongly than thewhites, because they are a great source of healthy fats and nutrients! Myfavorite omelet is made from four yolks and one egg white (you can feed theexcess egg whites to your pet). Just make sure you buy eggs that are eitherpastured or omega-3 eggs.Erythritol: This natural sweetener is a sugar alcohol. Your body processes itdifferently than traditional sugars—it doesn’t cause a spike in blood sugar.It’s also less likely to cause stomach upset than other sugar alternatives. Bestof all, it acts just like sugar when you bake with it, meaning it dissolveseasily into batters and tastes great. It’s often sold under the brand nameSwerve; Wholesome sells a version of it too.Flaxseed meal: Flaxseeds are a great source of short-chain omega-3s and containno lectins. The only hitch is, they need to be ground in order for your body tobe able to access those omega-3s, and once they are ground, they are very proneto oxidation. So the best way to add them to your diet is to buy them whole andgrind them as needed in a coffee or spice grinder. If you prefer to buy themalready ground, look for a product that was cold-milled, as heat can oxidize thefats, and then store it in the freezer to keep it fresh longer.Ghee: Otherwise known as clarified butter, ghee is butter that has had the milksolids (which consist of protein, including the troublesome casein A1) cookedout of it, making it shelf stable and easily digestible. Look for ghee made fromthe milk of grass-fed cows, which has a higher amount of omega-3s thanconventionally raised cows fed a diet of corn and soy. Pure and Pure IndianFoods are two grass-fed brands to look for.Goat’s milk, cheese, and yogurt: Goat’s milk also doesn’t contain casein A1(unlike most cow’s milk) and so it makes a more gut-friendly alternative totraditional dairy. You can also use goat cheese, sometimes known as chèvre, andgoat’s milk yogurt or kefir (stick to unsweetened, unflavored varieties).Hemp milk: Yes, this is the same hemp that is kin to marijuana (although eatingor drinking it will not give you a high). This is yet another alternative tocow’s milk that’s great in smoothies and other recipes. Again, stick to theunsweetened, unflavored varieties.Hemp protein powder: A great alternative to whey protein powder for vegans oranyone who wants to reduce their intake of animal protein, hemp protein powderprovides all the essential amino acids and plenty of omega-3s.Hemp tofu: Another way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of hemp is with thismore densely textured alternative to traditional tofu. You can find the non-GMOLiving Harvest Tempt brand of hemp tofu at Whole Foods.Honey: Although honey is a natural sugar, it is still sugar and should beconsumed only in very small amounts—one teaspoon or less a day—only in Phase 3of the Plant Paradox program. But if you need a sweetener and for some reasonstevia or erythritol (aka Swerve) just won’t cut it, raw local honey or manukahoney (which comes from bees that feed on the flowers of the manuka tree that’snative to New Zealand and Australia) is your only good choice. The enzymes inhoney do provide it some health benefit that no other natural sugar can match.Inulin: Sold under the brand name Just Like Sugar, inulin is made from chicoryroot or agave (the plant used to make tequila, not the sweetener) and is usefulin baking and in regular cooking as a replacement for sugar. It provides yourgut buddies with a polysaccharide that they love but you can’t digest. You canalso find it at Whole Foods under the brand name Viv Agave Organic Blue AgaveInulin, or online.Millet: You’re probably familiar with millet as it is a popular component ofbirdseed. But it is not just for the birds! This hull-less (and thus,lectin-free) grain is a tasty addition to your diet.Miracle Rice: If you’re really missing your rice and eating a small amount ofwhite basmati rice just isn’t going to cut it—and you don’t want to burn out oncauliflower rice—look for Miracle Rice in the refrigerated section, near thetofu. It’s made from konjac root, which is lectin-free.Mozzarella: True mozzarella—the kind that comes in ball-shapes of differentsizes—is made from the milk of water buffalo, meaning it doesn’t have casein A1.Read the label carefully; you want to buy “buffalo mozzarella.” Chances are, ifthe mozzarella is shredded, it’s made with cow’s milk. You can also find goat’smilk mozzarella, but you may have to go to Whole Foods or Amazon to find it.Nori: If you’re missing the convenience of tortillas for wraps, try this seaweedproduct that is often used in sushi rolls and is about the thickness of a sheetof paper. It’s great for scrambled eggs, tuna or salmon salad, or other sandwichfixings. Look for organic nori.Nutritional yeast: This is not the kind of yeast that causes bread to rise; it’sa B-vitamin-rich powder that lends a savory, cheesy taste to whatever yousprinkle it on. It’s available in natural food stores or online.Olive oil: I prefer European olive oils, especially Italian olive oil, but agreat American olive oil is called “O.” California Olive Ranch makes a reliableand affordable oil as well. Make sure to buy extra-virgin—I get mine at Costco;it comes from Tuscany in Italy. If you can find (and afford) organic, that’syour best choice. Good olive oil should be noticeably green, have a fresh,grassy smell, and come in an opaque glass bottle because it is photosensitive.By the way, if it makes you cough when you first try it, buy it! That means ithas a lot of polyphenols.Paprika: Another pepper-derived spice, like cayenne pepper, that doesn’t includethe skins and seeds and is therefore low-lectin. It imparts a rich flavor to avariety of dishes, particularly the smoked varieties.Parmigiano-Reggiano: The real deal Parmesan cheese, made from the milk ofItalian cows—which don’t have casein A1 in their milk—harvested only during thespring and fall when grasses are abundant (meaning the cows are grass-fed). Itcan cost up to $20 per pound, but a little bit of this strong, salty cheesepacks a big punch. Hold on to the rinds and add them to your broths, stocks, andsoups for even more depth of flavor.Pecorino-Romano: This Tuscan grating cheese is made from sheep’s milk, making ita good fit for the Plant Paradox program.Perilla oil: This oil, made from the seeds of the perilla plant, is low lectinand the most common cooking oil used in most Asian countries. It is a greatsource of the omega-3 fat alpha linolenic acid—containing more of it than anyother oil, with the added benefit of having brain-boosting rosmarinic acid init. Because perilla oil is a bit harder to find—look for it in Asian markets,natural food stores, and Whole Foods—I don’t call for it in the recipes in thisbook, but it can be used interchangeably with olive oil or coconut oil.Quorn products: This is a meat substitute derived from mushroom “roots,”although it doesn’t taste as “meaty” as your typical mushroom; it’s more similarin taste and texture to chicken. Not all Quorn products are PlantParadox–friendly—stick to the tenders, cutlets, and ground versions. It’simportant to note that these products aren’t vegan—there’s a little egg whiteprotein in them. The products in the vegan line contain potato and gluten, sothey aren’t part of the Plant Paradox program. Stay away from any breadedversion. You can find Quorn products in the vegetarian freezer section of mostsupermarkets.Sea salt, iodized: Sea salt contains many more trace minerals than traditionaltable salt and is therefore much more healthful. However, be sure to look forversions of sea salt that contain added iodine. Iodine is essential to thyroidfunction, and the most typical way we get it is by eating iodized table salt.Once the foodie craze kicked in and so many people switched to sea salt, whichtypically isn’t iodized, we started to see iodine deficiencies become morecommon. So give yourself the best of both worlds and buy iodized sea salt. It’spretty easy to find in most supermarkets, and even Morton’s now has an iodizedsea salt. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------How to Reduce the Lectin Content of Your Favorite FoodsOnce you’re in Phase 3 of the Plant Paradox program, you can start eating somefoods that contain lectins again—so long as you don’t notice any adversereactions, such as achiness, brain fog, or digestive issues. Knowing how toprepare your foods will help reduce the overall lectin content. To that end,here’s a handy guide to how to do that.FOODPREPARATIONCOOKINGTOMATOESPeel and seed—a serrated vegetable peeler makes this easy, or you can core them,cut a shallow X across the bottom and then pop them in boiling water for 30seconds to loosen the skins.Pressure-cooking your tomato soup or tomato sauce will reduce the lectin contenteven further.PEPPERSRemoving the skins and seeds of your favorite peppers (whether big bell peppersor smaller chili peppers) removes most of their lectins. Again, a serratedpeeler comes in handy here.Roasting peppers—either on a grill, directly on a gas burner, or under a broilerin the oven—makes the skins easy to remove. Fermenting also reduces lectins, andmost hot sauces are fermented.ZUCCHINI AND EGGPLANTSTechnically fruits because they contain seeds, these foods have a lower lectinlevel when you eat the baby versions (which have fewer seeds). Peeling them willreduce lectins even further.Pressure-cooking destroys the lectins present in these nightshades and rendersthe flesh of the plants tender and moist for use in pasta dishes.BEANSSoaking beans in plenty of water with multiple water changes over 24 to 48 hoursbefore cooking reduces lectins.Pressure-cooking destroys whatever lectins remain. If you don’t have a pressurecooker, look for Eden Brand beans; they are pressure-cooked right in their cans.RICEBecause lectins are contained mostly in the brown hull that covers grains ofrice, white rice has fewer lectins than brown rice. Rinsing the rice before youcook it also helps. Because Indian basmati rice has the highest resistant starchcontent of any rice, I recommend you stick to small amounts of that version ifyou choose to eat rice. To further increase the resistant starch of rice,refrigerate it after cooking, then reheat when ready to use.Pressure-cooking rice reduces lectins further.CUCUMBERS, SQUASHES, MELONS, PEACHES, AND OTHER FRUITSTwo words: Peel and seed. SOYFermenting removes most of the lectins from soybeans, which means that thefermented forms of soy, including miso, tempeh (the grain-free kind), and nattoare preferable to tofu and edamame. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorghum: Along with millet, sorghum is one of the very rare grains without ahull and thus is a lectin-free grain. It can be eaten as a breakfast cereal,served as a side dish, or even popped like popcorn. Bob’s Red Mill carries it,or you can find a popped version of it, called Mini Pops, online.Stevia: This natural sweetener contains no calories and won’t cause a spike inblood sugar. Derived from the stevia plant, you can buy it in powdered form orin liquid drops. Because it is 300 times sweeter than sugar, a little goes quitea long way. I prefer the SweetLeaf brand because it doesn’t have fillers such asmaltodextrin like other brands often do, and the first ingredient is inulin,which your gut buddies love.Tempeh: Tempeh is a form of fermented soy that’s sold in the refrigerator caseby the tofu. Look for organic, non-GMO versions, as most soy is GMO, madewithout grains (most tempeh sold in the U.S. is mixed with grains). Like tofu,tempeh doesn’t have a great taste on its own, but picks up the flavors of otheringredients well, and is a good source of protein for vegans and vegetarians.Vanilla extract: Be careful to buy only vanilla extract that says “pure” on thelabel—otherwise, what you’re buying likely contains a slew of chemicals thatmimic the taste of vanilla rather than the beans themselves. If you are missingsweetened, flavored yogurts, add a touch of pure vanilla extract and a few dropsof stevia to your goat, sheep, hemp, or coconut yogurt—even kids love it.VeganEgg: Made from algal flour, nutritional yeast, and other plant sources,this product provides much of the same taste and binding abilities of real eggs.It is gluten-free, lectin-free, dairy-free, and non-GMO. This is a relativelynew product from the makers of Vegenaise, so it’s not widely available in storesyet, although you can buy it online at Thrive Market or Amazon.Yogurt: You want to avoid most commercial yogurts for two important reasons—mostof the cow’s milk used to make it contains casein A1, and any flavored yogurt isloaded with added sugars and often artificial stabilizers and flavorings.Instead, stick to yogurt made from goat, sheep, hemp, or coconut milk. They areavailable at Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and natural food grocery stores.Kitchen ToolsReally all you need to cook the Plant Paradox way are a couple of knives, a fewpans, and an oven. But having a handful of other tools on hand will make theprocess more enjoyable and your results even more delicious, both of which meanyou’ll be more likely to stick with it. These are the ones I use most often andrecommend you consider purchasing if you don’t have them already:Blender: I use a blender nearly every day. The high-speed blenders on themarket, such as Blendtec, Vitamix, or Ninja, make quick work of smoothies, canblend and heat soups (so no need to dirty a pan), and do some of your prep workfor you by chopping and combining ingredients. If you don’t have a full-sizeblender and don’t want to acquire one, the Magic Bullet or the largerNutriBullet are good, smaller options.Food processor: A food processor is like having three extra sets of hands. Itchops, mixes, and slices in just a few pulses. And you’ll never again have toscrape down the sides of a blender when making pesto!Knives: Having a good chef’s knife and paring knife makes prep work a breeze.Keep them well-sharpened as you are more likely to injure yourself with a dullknife than a sharp one. Good knives are a cook’s best friend.Magic Bullet: This mini appliance is a blender/food processor hybrid. Andbecause it’s inexpensive, it’s a great starter blender. The only drawback isthat it is small. If you cook for a family or regularly entertain, you wouldprobably be better served with a full-size high-speed blender.Microwave: You probably already have one and if you don’t, you certainly don’tneed to purchase one in order to be able to make these recipes. But if you dohave one, you can get a few meals in this book on the table in minutes.Mixing bowls: These are the type of kitchen tools where having the right onesmakes a huge difference in your ease and enjoyment. Look for a set of mixingbowls (large, medium, and small) with high sides so the contents don’t sloshover the edge and onto your counter or floor. You could use a stand mixer inlieu of mixing bowls—if you have a stand mixer, it may come in handy when makingthe recipes in this book—though I mixed every recipe myself by hand. (I didn’twant to lug my stand mixer out from the bottom shelf, and I liked knowing thatrecipes could be done by hand if you don’t happen to have a stand mixer.)Pressure cooker: If you want to enjoy eating beans or tomato sauce, a pressurecooker is invaluable. I love the Instant Pot, which is an electric pressurecooker that regulates the pressure for you, so you don’t have to worry aboutpotential explosions—a hazard of old-fashioned pressure cookers that you mayrecall from your grandmother’s pressure-cooking days. You can also use anInstant Pot as a slow cooker, or as a sauté pan (it has a high-heat setting soyou can brown meat or onions right in it without starting on the stove). I findthem to be more than worth the expense—they cost about $100—but they also go onsale every Black Friday, and frequently you’ll find them at Costco or Target foras little as $69. Just be sure never to overfill any type of pressure cooker,digital or not. That “do not fill above this line” line is not a suggestion,it’s for your safety.Salad spinner: I know what you might be thinking—not another gadget! But greensare such an important part of any healthy diet, and if they are dried properlythey will last longer in the fridge and dressings will cling perfectly to them.I could not believe the difference this gadget made in my and my wife Penny’slives when we bought one! It makes buying organic greens and lettuces whole asnap to prepare: chop, throw in the spinner basket, rinse, then spin away thewater! No more plastic bags that use questionable chemicals to keep thatpre-chopped lettuce “fresh” for a week.Skillets: Having a good pan makes food taste better and cleanup easier. Pleaseresist the temptation to buy or use a skillet with a nonstick coating, as theseare made out endocrine-disrupting chemicals that get released into your food.Instead, look for a skillet with a ceramic coating or high-quality stainlesssteel. And please, throw that cast iron skillet without a ceramic coating in thetrash. I can’t tell you the number of patients I see who use a cast iron skilletabout once a week and have dangerously high iron levels.Spiralizer: This handy tool makes noodles out of all kinds of vegetables, suchas jicama, sweet potatoes, and daikon radish, so you can have a pasta-like dishthat doesn’t disrupt your gut. You don’t need a fancy, electronic one. Thehand-held version works just great and only costs about $15.Vegetable peelers: Remember, lectins are found in the peels and seeds of plants,so having a peeler helps you lighten your lectin load. I recommend having twokinds: one with straight-edge blades and one with serrated-edge blades. Theserrated edge lets you peel delicate things, like tomatoes, saving you the stepof blanching them.I’m not suggesting you need to invest in new kitchen gear, but even if youdecide to buy one or two things, keep this in mind: The vast majority of mypatients tell me that they save money on the Plant Paradox program. No moretakeout or expensive prepared foods—just simple, whole foods. Not to mention themoney they save when they throw out their prescriptions (with a doctor’ssupervision, of course).And with that, let’s get cooking!"},{"pageContent":"Part Two [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rpt2]image [../images/linept.jpg]Recipes [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rpt2]image [../images/f1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Five [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch5]image [../images/linech.jpg]Appetizers and Snacks [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rch5]image [../images/linech.jpg]Brazilian Cheesy Bread [9780062843388_Recipe_1.xhtml#sec1]Avocado Deviled Eggs [9780062843388_Recipe_2.xhtml#sec2]Dr. Gundry’s Nut Mix 2.0 [9780062843388_Recipe_3.xhtml#sec3]Cauliflower Fritters [9780062843388_Recipe_4.xhtml#sec4]Broccoli Puffs [9780062843388_Recipe_5.xhtml#sec5]Caramelized Onion Dip [9780062843388_Recipe_6.xhtml#sec6]Cassava Tortillas (and Chips) [9780062843388_Recipe_7.xhtml#sec7]Chips Three Ways [9780062843388_Recipe_8.xhtml#sec8]Buffalo Cauliflower Bites [9780062843388_Recipe_9.xhtml#sec9]Garlic-and-Walnut-Stuffed Mushrooms [9780062843388_Recipe_10.xhtml#sec10]Grain-Free Crackers [9780062843388_Recipe_11.xhtml#sec11]image [../images/f2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Brazilian Cheesy Bread [9780062843388_Chapter_5.xhtml#rsec1]image [../images/f3.jpg]There’s a tiny neighborhood pizza place in Los Angeles that serves the mostaddictive Pão de Queijo—a super-flavorful Brazilian cheesy bread that fits thePlant Paradox program perfectly.

Arrange two racks in your oven so they’re evenly spaced, and preheat the oven to 450°F. 2. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. 3. Place the milk, oil, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat when big bubbles start to form. 4. Add the cassava flour to the saucepan and stir with a wooden spoon until mixture is well combined. A gelatinous dough will begin to form. 5.

Keeping the mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs into the cooled mixture one at a time. Wait until the first egg is fully incorporated before adding the second. Scrape down sides of the bowl regularly to ensure consistent mixing. 7. If using cheese, beat it in on medium speed. You’ll end up with a stretchy, sticky dough that’s softer than a cookie dough, but stiffer than a cake batter. 8. Scoop the dough with a small ice cream scoop and place on the baking sheets, spacing them evenly (you should have about 12 per sheet). Dip scoop in a bowl of water between scoops to keep dough from sticking. 9. Place the baking sheets in the oven and reduce heat to 350°F. Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the baking sheets. 10.

But I want people to feel empowered, not deprived. So Iworked with my friend Irina Skoeries, the founder of Catalyst Cuisine, todevelop not one, but three different chip recipes to scratch that junk food itchin a healthy way!Sweet Potato Chips1 Japanese sweet potato, peeled2 to 3 cups avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil2 tablespoons iodized sea salt 1. Using a vegetable peeler, slice the sweet potato into thin slices. 2. Coat the bottom of a large skillet with 1 to 2 inches of oil. 3. Heat oil on medium until “shimmering.” 4. Sear the sweet potato slices until golden brown on one side. Flip and repeat. 5. Place the golden chips on a paper towel and sprinkle with salt. 6. Repeat the process until all slices are golden brown.Plantain Chips2 green plantains, peeled and thinly sliced1½ tablespoons olive oil¾ teaspoon saltFreshly ground pepper to taste 1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet and set aside. 2. In a bowl, combine plantain slices, olive oil, and seasonings by gently tossing with your hands. 3. Spread plantains on prepared cookie sheet in a single layer. 4. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning plantains halfway through (after about 8 minutes). 5. Remove from the oven when plantain chips start to brown around the edges.Prosciutto Chips10 thin slices pasture-raised prosciutto 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet. 2. Lay the slices of prosciutto on the parchment-lined cookie sheet in a single layer. 3. Bake until crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes. Leave them to cool (they get crispier when chilled). 4. Break into smaller pieces, and add them to any entrée as a topping, on top of salads, or just eat them by themselves.

Using a ¼-cup measuring cup or another utensil, carefully pour 3 rows of 4 circles of batter on the baking sheet. The circles should be approximately 2¾ inches to 3 inches across. (They will continue to spread a little after pouring.) 5. Sprinkle each cracker with desired topping. 6. Bake for 10 minutes at 350°F, then increase heat to 400°F. (Starting with the lower temperature helps prevent crackers from bubbling up in the center so they stay flat.) 7. Bake for another 20 minutes, or until crackers are golden.

When the butter, if using, is melted, slowly pour the egg mixture into the pan, tilting the pan to spread egg mixture evenly. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, periodically pulling back a small section of the edge to let more uncooked egg come in contact with the pan surface, until the mixture holds together. (It will still be slightly wet in the middle—the center continues to cook after you fold it.) 4. Tilt the pan to one side and use a spatula to fold a third of the omelet into the middle (like folding a piece of paper to fit in an envelope.) 5. Holding the pan above a serving plate, tip the pan so the omelet rolls off, folding the remaining third of the omelet underneath. 6. Serve as is, or with salad.HerbTo make an herb omelet, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh herbs to the egg mixturebefore cooking. I suggest minced parsley, thyme, and dill.

It’s also where I sell thesupplements I have painstakingly developed to help support the health of myself,my family, and my patients.DR. GUNDRY FACEBOOK PAGE(https://www.facebook.com/GundryMD/)Follow me on Facebook to not only get recipes and articles delivered to yournews feed but also to meet other folks like you who are devoted to eating thePlant Paradox way.SupplementsIt’s my firm belief that even if you have the most immaculate, health-promotingdiet, you can still benefit from the right supplements. Why? Because modernfarming practices, such as the use of pesticides, herbicides, and chemicalfertilizers, have depleted our soil of nutrients and friendly bacterialpopulations. You simply can’t get all the nutrients and micronutrients you needfrom food, because the food you eat isn’t able to deliver those nutrients fromthe soil.In my own life and in my practice with the thousands of patients I have seen,these are the supplements I recommend, because these vitamins and minerals areessential to our well-being, and the vast majority of us are deficient in them:VITAMIN DEven here in sunny Southern California, about 80 percent of my patients arevitamin D deficient when I first begin treating them, and that number is closerto 100 percent if those patients have an autoimmune disorder. This is a seriousproblem, because vitamin D plays an important role in helping your immune systemto function, your bones to stay strong, and your beneficial intestinal flora andgut wall to be healthy. I recommend that everyone take at least 5,000 IUs ofvitamin D3 daily, and if you have an autoimmune condition, make that 10,000.B VITAMINSB vitamins are key for protecting the inner lining of your blood vessels, andabout half the population has a genetic mutation that prevents them from beingable to convert folic acid and vitamin B12 into their active forms. To make sureyou are getting enough B vitamins in a form that your body can use, I recommendtaking methylfolate (the active form of folic acid), 1,000 mcg a day, and methylB12 (the active form of vitamin B12), 1,000 to 5,000 mcg under your tongue eachday.GREEN PLANT PHYTOCHEMICALSYour gut buddies love greens, but you have to take care not to take a greenssupplement that contains lectin-rich grasses such as wheatgrass, barley grass,or oat grass. The supplements I recommend to lend you the vibrance of eatinglarge amount of greens are: * Spinach extract, 1,000 mg * DIM (diindolylmethane), an immune-boosting compound found in broccoli, 100 mg * Primal Plants, a supplement available on GundryMD.com, that combines spinach extract, DIM, and ten other superfood greensPOLYPHENOLSThese phytochemicals protect plants from insects and sun damage, and they offermany benefits to you, including improved cardiovascular health and support ofyour gut bacteria. The polyphenol-containing supplements I recommend takingdaily (you can choose one, or take a combination) are: * Grape seed extract, 100 mg * Pine tree bark extract, 25 to 100 mg * Resveratrol (the polyphenol in red wine) * Or you can take Vital Reds, my own blend of polyphenols that I sell at GundryMD.com, which contains thirty-four polyphenols total, including green tea extract, berberine, cinnamon, mulberry, and pomegranate, as well as my favorite probiotic.PREBIOTICSPrebiotics are the substances that feed and nourish your gut buddies—they arethe fertilizer that boosts the health of your internal garden. In addition tosupporting your immunity, prebiotics will help to keep you regular. Goodprebiotic supplements include: * Psyllium husks, a teaspoon a day in water, working up to a tablespoon per day * Inulin powder, a teaspoon a day (the sweetener Just Like Sugar is primarily inulin) * PrebioThrive, a combination of five prebiotics that I formulated and sell on GundryMD.com. It’s a powder that you mix with water and drink every day.LECTIN BLOCKERSRemember, you can’t avoid all lectins in your diet. For the lectins you doconsume, it helps to have some lectin-fighting compounds in your system. Theseinclude: * Glucosamine, which occurs naturally in the fluid that surrounds and protects your joints and serves a building block of cartilage, binds to inflammatory lectins and reduces pain. You can take one Osteo Bi-Flex or Move Free (both can be found at Costco) daily. * D-mannose, the active ingredient in cranberries, is also an effective lectin blocker. Take 1,000 mg a day (divided into two doses of 500 mg each). * Lectin Shield, which is my formulation available on my website, contains nine ingredients that have been proven to block or absorb lectins so that they don’t reach your gut wall; you can take two of these before a meal that you suspect will be high in lectins.SUGAR BLOCKERSTo maintain healthy blood glucose levels, I recommend the following: * CinSulin, a combination of chromium and cinnamon available at Costco, two capsules a day * Zinc, 30 mg * Selenium, 150 mcg * Berberine, 250 mg twice a day * Turmeric extract, 200 mg twice a day * Glucose Defense, a product I formulated and sell at GundryMD.com, covers all these bases by combining chromium, zinc, selenium, cinnamon bark extract, berberine, turmeric extract, and black pepper extract (for better absorbability), two capsules twice a day.OMEGA-3SOmega-3 fats are vital to the health of your gut and the health of your brain.In fact, half the fat in your brain—which is made up of 60 percent fat intotal—is a long-chain omega-3 fat called DHA. Yes, in my ten years of seeingpatients, nearly everyone is majorly deficient in these vital fats. Unlessyou’re eating sardines or herring on a daily basis, you likely need to take anomega-3 supplement. I recommend: * Fish oil, molecularly distilled and from small fish such as sardines and anchovies, enough to get 1,000 mg of DHA per day. Brands I like include Kirkland Signature Fish Oil (enteric coated, for no fish burps), OmegaVia DHA 600, and Carlson Elite Omega-3 Gems."},{"pageContent":"Endnotes [9780062843388_Contents.xhtml#rnote] 1 [9780062843388_Chapter_1a.xhtml#ren1] Hermanussen M.
