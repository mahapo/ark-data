For decades, I believed t hose lies as well. I was eating a “healthy” diet (a fter all, I’m a heart surgeon). I rarely ate fast food; I consumed low-fat dairy and whole grains. (Okay, I will admit to having a penchant for Diet Coke, but that was better than dr inking the original sugar-filled brew, right?) Nor was I a slouch in the fitness department. I ran thirty miles a wee k and worked out at the gym daily. Despite the fact that I was hauling around excess weight, had high blood pressu re, migraine headaches, arthritis, high cholesterol , and insulin resistance, I continued to believe that I was doing everything right. (Spoiler: I’m now seventy pounds lighter and no longer have any of these health issues.) But a nagg ing voice inside my head kept asking the same quest ion: “If I’m doing everything right, why is this happening to me ?” Does this sound eerily familiar? If you’re reading this book, you, too, probably kno w that something isn’t right, but you don’t know wh at. Maybe you simply can’t take control of your raging appeti te or cravings for certain foods. Low-carb, low-fat , Paleo, low- glycemic, and other diets haven’t helped and were u nsustainable—or after initial success, the lost wei ght quickly crept back. Nor has running, speed walking, weight training, aerobics, CrossFit, yoga, core training, spinning, high- intensity interval training, or whichever exercise program(s) you’ve embarked upon banished those stub born extra pounds. Excess weight (or being significantly underweight) is a serious problem, but perhaps your primary conc ern is food intolerances and cravings, digestive issues, headac hes, brain fog, lack of energy, aching joints, morn ing stiffness, adult acne, or a host of other conditions you just can’t shake. Possibly, you suffer from one or more autoimmune diseases or a disorder such as type 1 or type 2 dia betes, metabolic syndrome, or a thyroid or other ho rmonal condition. Perhaps you have asthma or allergies. Yo u may feel that somehow you’re at fault for your po or health or your excess pounds, adding guilt to your heavy load . If it is any comfort, you are not alone. All that is about to change for you. Welcome to The Plant Paradox. First, repeat after me: “I am not to blame.” That’s right: your health problems are not your fault. I have the solution to what ails you, but please pr epare to have all your assumptions about what you t hought you knew about living a healthy life challenged. This i nformation will dispel myths that are embedded in o ur culture, and introduce concepts that may initially blow your mind. But here’s the really good news. The secrets I’ll share with you will reveal what is keeping you sick, tire d, depleted of energy, overweight (or underweight), fuzzy headed, or in pain. And once you discover and remove the ro adblocks standing in the way of vibrant health and a slim body, your life will change. You see, with all modesty, I’ve found there is a co mmon cause for most health problems. It is based on ample research, including my own papers, published in pee r-reviewed medical journals, but no one has put it all together before. While health “experts” have pointed to our laziness, our addiction to fast food, our consumpti on of beverages full of high-fructose corn syrup, and the host of toxins in the environment as causes for ou r current ailments (among many others), sadly, they are wrong . (Not that these things don’t contribute to poor health!) The real cause is so well hidden that you would never h ave noticed it. But I am getting ahead of myself. Starting in the mid-1960s, we have seen a rampant r ise in obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, autoimm une diseases, asthma, allergies and sinus conditions, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, Parkinson’s di sease, and dementia. Not coincidentally, in the same period, t here have been many seemingly imperceptible changes in our diet and in the personal care products we use. I’ve discovered a significant part of the answer to the mystery of why our collective health has declined and our collecti ve weight has risen so drastically in just a few de cades—and it starts with plant proteins called lectins. You’ve probably never heard of lectins, but you are definitely familiar with gluten, which is just one lectin among thousands. Lectins are found in almost all plants, as well as some other foods. In fact, lectins are p resent in the vast majority of foods in the current American diet, inc luding meat, poultry, and fish. Among their other f unctions,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"majority of foods in the current American diet, inc luding meat, poultry, and fish. Among their other f unctions, lectins level the playing field in the war between plants and animals. How so? Long before humans walk ed the earth, plants protected themselves and their offspr ing from hungry insects by producing toxins, includ ing lectins, in the plants’ seeds and other parts. It turns out the same plant toxins that can kill or immobilize an insect can also silently destroy you r health and insidiously impact your weight. I titled this book The Plant Paradox because while many plant foods are good for you—and form the bedrock of my eating plan—others t hat have been regarded as “health foods” are actual ly to blame for making you sick and overweight. That’s ri ght, most plants actually want to make you ill. Ano ther paradox: small portions of some plants are good for you but large amounts are bad for you. We’ll delve into more detail on all of this shortly . Have you ever been told, “You’re just not yourself today”? As you’ll learn, thanks to subtle changes i n the foods we eat most often, the way food is prepared, the use o f certain personal care products, and the drugs tha t you assume will improve your health, you really aren’t “yourse lf” anymore. To borrow a term from the computer wor ld, you’ve been hacked. The entire collection of cells, the in puts and outputs within you, and the way your cells communicate with one another have been altered. Not to worry. This alteration can be reversed, allo wing your body to heal and achieve a healthy weight . To begin the restoration of our collective health, we need t o take a step back—actually several steps—in order to move forward. We chose the first wrong fork in the road thousands of years ago and have continued to take a dditional wrong paths at almost every opportunity. (Just to b e clear, the so-called Paleo diet is the furthest t hing from what I am talking about.) This book will provide the road map to get back on track, starting with eliminating our overreliance on certain foods as our primary form o f sustenance. What you have just read might seem so unbelievable that you may be wondering about the experience I’ve had that could have led to such claims, or if I’m even reall y a doctor. I assure you I am. As a bit of backgrou nd, after graduating from Yale University with honors, I got my MD from the Medical College of Georgia and then entered the cardiothoracic surgery program at the Universit y of Michigan. I later won a prestigious fellowship in research at the National Institutes of Health. I spent sixteen years as a professor of surgery and pediatrics in c ardiothoracic surgery and head of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, where I saw te ns of thousands of patients with a spectrum of health iss ues, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, auto immune conditions, diabetes, and obesity. Then, in a move that stunned my colleagues, I left Loma Linda. Why would a successful practitioner of conventional medicine leave such an important position at a pre stigious medical center? When I turned my own health around and went from obese to slim, something in me had sh ifted: I realized that I could reverse heart disease with di et instead of surgery. To this end, I established t he International Heart and Lung Institute—and within it the Center f or Restorative Medicine—in Palm Springs and Santa B arbara, California. I published my first book, Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes Tha t Are Killing You and Your Waistline , which described the changes my heart, diabetic, o bese, and other patients experienced on my diet plan—and which revolutionized my medical practice a nd changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of re aders. It also helped propel me on the path that ultimately l ed to this book. In addition to being a physician, I’m a medical res earcher and inventor of many of the devices used to protect the heart during heart surgery. With my former partner, Leonard Bailey, I performed more infant and pediat ric heart transplants than anyone in the world. I hold multip le patents on medical devices and have written exte nsively on transplant immunology and xenotransplantation. That mouthful of a word refers to fooling the immune sy stem of one species to accept the organ of another species. Thanks to my work with xenotransplantation, I happ en to hold the record for the longest-surviving pig-to-baboon heart transplant. So, yes, I know how to fool the i mmune system —and I know when the immune system is being fooled. I also know how to fix it. Unlike so many authors and so-called health experts , this isn’t my first rodeo. I wrote my senior thes is at Yale University about how food availability at different times of year prompted the evolution of great apes into modern humans. As a heart surgeon, cardiologist, and immun ologist, my entire career has been about how the im mune system makes decisions about what is its friend and what is its foe. The wealth of these experiences m ade me"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"system makes decisions about what is its friend and what is its foe. The wealth of these experiences m ade me uniquely qualified to discover the solution to your health and weight problems introduced in this book . In my evolving role as a health sleuth, I came to f ind that many patients who had used my diet to reve rse coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes (or a com bination of two or three) related that their arthri tis also quickly began to subside and their heartburn disappeared. M y patients also noted improved mood and resolution of fairly chronic bowel issues. Excess pounds disappeared eff ortlessly, along with food cravings. As I studied t he results of the elaborate lab tests I devised for each patient and experimented with the allowed foods, certain st riking patterns emerged, which made me start tinkering with the ori ginal dietary program. Rewarding as these results were, it wasn’t enough f or me just to see these dramatic improvements in my patients. I needed to know the whats and whys. (Remember, I’m a researcher as well as a physician.) What altered t hat had made them ill and overweight? Which items on the li sts of “good” and “bad” foods that I gave all my pa tients restored their health? Or, more important, which el iminated foods had been part of the problem? And we re factors other than dietary changes also playing a role? A meticulous review of my patients’ histories, phys ical conditions, specialized lab tests, and tests o n the flexibility of blood vessels convinced me that most of them (an d most likely you, as well) are literally at war wi th themselves, thanks to common “disruptors” that interfere with t he body’s natural ability to heal itself. These dis ruptors encompass changes in how food animals are themselve s fed, as well as in some foods that are regarded a s healthful —whole grains, lentils, and other beans, for exampl e—plus a host of chemicals, including herbicides li ke Roundup, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. On top o f that, I’ve found that antacids, aspirin, and othe r nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have drastically c hanged the environment in your gut. Over the past fifteen years, I have presented my fi ndings at prestigious academic medical conferences such as the American Heart Association and published them in pe er-reviewed medical journals, all the while refinin g my program. 1 As a result of this work, I have become an acknowle dged expert on the human microbiome, the bacterial and other organisms that live in you and on you. As it stands, the Plant Paradox Program consists of a cornucopia of vegetables, limited amounts of hig h-quality protein sources, as well as certain fruits (but onl y in season), tree nuts, and certain dairy products and oils. Equally important are the foods I omit, at least initially— namely, grains and the flours made from them, pseud o-grains, lentils and other legumes (including all soy produc ts), fruits that we call vegetables (tomatoes, pepp ers, and their kin), and refined oils. You may be in a rush to get started on the Plant Pa radox Program ASAP, but I’ve found that my patients are far more likely to succeed in healing themselves when t hey understand the root causes behind their poor he alth. So, before we get to the “solution,” I’ll spend Part I explaining the often shocking and frequently amazin g story of those root causes and how they have affected most of us o ver the last several decades. When you get to Part II, you’ll learn how to start the program with a three-day cle anse. Then you’ll find out how to repair your damag ed gut and feed your gut microbes the food they need to thrive , including a group of foods called resistant starc hes, which conveniently also help you feel satiated and shed u nwanted pounds and inches. Once you’ve stabilized y our health, you’ll move on to Phase 3 of the Plant Paradox Prog ram, which becomes your blueprint for longevity. Th e program includes regular modified fasts to give your gut a mini-vacation from the hard work of digestion. At t he same time, it allows the energy-producing mitochondria in your brain and cells a chance to enjoy a well-deserved rest. For those of you with acute health needs, I’ve provided a chapter on the Plant Paradox Intensive Care Prog ram. In Part III, I’ll provide meal plans and simple but delecta ble recipes for all three phases of the Plant Parad ox Program. They’ll make you forget those problematic foods tha t once kept you plump, sick, and in pain. While modifying your eating habits is a significant component of the program, I’ll also recommend othe r changes, such as eliminating certain over-the-counter drugs and personal care products. Follow the complete pro gram and I promise you will banish most, if not all, of your h ealth problems, achieve a healthy weight, reboot yo ur energy level, and elevate your mood. Once you start experi encing the effects of this new approach to eating a nd living—my patients start to feel better and lose weight withi n days—you’ll understand the remarkable changes tha t occur when you feed your body (and your microbiome) foods on w hich it thrives.

You haven’t mistakenly dipped into a botany textbook or parachuted into the set of Avatar . You have my assurance that this book will help yo u learn how to be slim and energized and lay the foundation for vibrant health and longevity . If you wonder why knowing how plants operate coul d possibly affect you—to say nothing of whether plants possess intention—fasten your seat belt and prepare to be amazed as we take a brief tour through the last 400 million y ears. Along the way, you’ll come to understand that leaves, fruits, grains, and other vegetable foods aren’t just sitti ng there accepting their fate as part of your dinne r. They have their own sophisticated ways of defending themselves from plant predators like you, including the use of tox ic chemicals. But first, let me make one thing crystal clear. The re is no question that consuming certain plants is essential for good health—and therein lies the paradox. They powe r your body and provide most of the hundreds of vit amins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients that yo u need not just to live, but also to thrive. Over t he last fifteen years, more than ten thousand of my patients have f ound that following my Plant Paradox Program result s in both weight loss and remarkable reversals of numerous he alth problems. Meanwhile, people whose digestive is sues had made them unable to keep pounds on were finally abl e to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Unlike the Paleo diet and other low-carb or even ketogenic diets, al l of which stress heavy meat consumption, you’ll be dining mostly on certain plant foods, as well as a small a mount of wild fish and shellfish and the occasional serving of pastured meat. I also provide vegan and vegetarian variations. Now here’s a shocker to start off your reeducation: the more fruit I removed from an individual’s diet , the healthier he or she became and the more his or her cholestero l numbers and markers for kidney function improved. The more I removed vegetables that have lots of seeds, such as cucumbers and squash, the better my patients fel t, the more weight they lost, and the more their cholesterol le vels improved! (By the way, any so-called vegetable that has seeds, such as a tomato, cucumber, or squash, and e ven string beans, is botanically a fruit.) Plus, th e more shellfish and egg yolks the patients ate, the lower their cho lesterol numbers. Yes, that’s correct. Eating shell fish and egg yolks dramatically reduces total cholesterol. 1 As I said in the Introduction, forget everything yo u thought you knew was true. It’s All About Survival EVERY LIVING THING possesses the drive to survive and pass on its gen es to future generations. We consider plants our friends because they feed us, but plants regard all plant predators, including us, as enemi es. However, even enemies have their uses. Therein lies the dile mma we plant eaters face: the very foods we need to eat have their own ways of discouraging us from consuming th em and their offspring. The result is an ongoing ba ttle between the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom. But not all plants are created equal. Some of the v ery vegetables and fruits that sustain us simultane ously contain substances that can harm us. We’ve been glossing ov er this paradox for literally ten thousand years. G luten, of course, is one example of a plant component that is problematic for some people, as the recent gluten- free craze has spotlighted. But glutens are just one example of th e kind of protein known as a lectin and one factor in the Plant Paradox, and they may well have sent us off on a wi ld goose chase, as you’ll soon learn. I’ll introduc e you to the larger world of lectins later in this chapter. The Plant Paradox Program introduced in this book o ffers a broader, more nuanced, and more comprehensi ve look at how plants can sometimes hurt us and also reveal s the link among lectins (and other defensive plant chemicals), weight gain, and disease.

Humans and other plant ea ters are not the only ones with an agenda. Quite si mply, plants don’t want to be eaten—and who can blame them? Like any living thing, their instinct is to propagate t he next generation of their species. To this end, plants ha ve come up with devilishly clever ways to protect t hemselves and their offspring from predators. Again, let me make it crystal clear that I am not anti-plant. If you h ave ever had lunch with me, you’ll know that I am a devoted plan t predator! That said, I will guide you through the confusing garden of plant options to teach you which are your friends, which are your foes, and which can be tam ed in one way or another, perhaps with certain preparation me thods or by eating them only in season. In the deadly game of predator versus prey, an adul t gazelle can often outrun a hungry lioness, an ale rt sparrow can take flight when stalked by a domestic cat, and a s kunk can let loose a spray of noxious liquid to tem porarily blind a fox. The stakes aren’t always rigged against the pr ey. But when the prey is a plant, the poor thing is helpless, right? No way! Plants appeared on land about 450 million years ago , 2 long before the first insects arrived 90 million ye ars later. Until those plant predators turned up, it must have truly been a Garden of Eden for plants. There was no need to run, hide, or fight. They could grow and thrive in peace , unfettered in their production of the seeds that would become the next generation of their species. But when inse cts and other animals (and eventually our primate a ncestors) arrived, it was game on. These species saw those ta sty greens and seeds as dinner. And although plants don’t want to be eaten any more than you would, animals would seem to have the advantage, with wings and/or legs to propel them over to that grove of immobile greens to gobbl e them up. Not so fast. Plants have actually evolved an awesom e array of defensive strategies to protect themselv es, or at least their seeds, from animals of all shapes and sizes, including humans. Plants may use a variety of physi cal deterrents, such as color to blend into their surroundings; an unpleasant texture; sticky stuff such as resins and saps that entangle insects, provide protective cover by makin g sand or soil clump, 3 or attract grit that makes them unpleasant to eat; or a simple reliance on a hard outer coatin g, such as a coconut, or spine-tipped leaves, such as an artichoke. Other defensive strategies are far subtler. Plants are great chemists—and alchemists, for that matter: they can turn sunbeams into matter! They have evolved to use biol ogical warfare to repel predators—poisoning, paraly zing, or disorienting them—or to reduce their own digestibil ity to stay alive and protect their seeds, enhancin g the chances that their species will endure. Both these physical and chemical defensive strategies are remarkably e ffective at keeping predators at bay, and even sometimes at get ting animals to do their bidding. Because their initial predators were insects, plant s developed some lectins that would paralyze any un fortunate bug that tried to dine on them. Obviously, there is a q uantum size difference between insects and mammals, but both are subject to the same effects. (If you are suffering from neuropathy, take notice!) Clearly, most of you won’t be paralyzed by a plant compound within minutes of eat ing it, although a single peanut (a lectin) certain ly has the potential to kill certain people. But we are not im mune to the long-term effects of eating certain pla nt compounds. Because of the huge number of cells we mammals have , we may not see the damaging results of consuming such compounds for years. And even if this is happening to you, you don’t know it yet. I learned of this connection via hundreds of my pat ients who respond almost instantly, often in fascin ating ways, to these mischievous plant compounds. For this reason, I call these patients my “canaries.” Coal miners u sed to take caged canaries into the mines with them because the birds are especially subject to the lethal effects of carbon monoxide and methane. As long as the canaries sang, the miners felt safe, but if the chirping stopped, it was a clear signal to evacuate the mine posthaste. My “canaries ” are more sensitive to certain lectins than the av erage person, which is actually an advantage in terms of seeking help sooner rather than later. You learn about some of them in the Success Stories throughout the book. (Note that all but a few names are pseudonyms to protect peop le’s privacy.)

Plants Are Master Manipulators A LITTLE BOTANY lesson here: Seeds are actually the plant’s “babie s,” which become the next generation of a plant species. (No, I’m not being sentimental or an thropomorphic. Botanists and other scientists regul arly refer to plant seeds as babies.) It’s a tough world out ther e for those potential plants, so a lot more are pro duced than will ever actually take root. Plant seeds can be divided into two basic types. Some are babies that plants actually want predators to eat. These seeds are encased in a hard coating designed to survive a trip all the way thr ough the predator’s GI tract, although a large baby, such as a peach seed, might not be swallowed, and instead simply be left behind. Then there are “naked babies,” which lack s uch a protective coating; the plant does not want these to be eaten (more on them shortly). Fruit trees, which bear seeds enclosed in a hull, a re one example of the first type of plant seeds. Th e mother plant relies on animals to eat the seeds before they fall to the ground. The objective is to have their babi es wind up some distance away from the mother plant, so that they d on’t have to compete with it for sun, moisture, and nutrients. This increases the species’ chances of survival whi le also broadening its range. If the swallowed seed remains intact, it emerges from the animal along with a nic e dollop of poop, to boost its chance of sprouting. Thanks to the protective hull, there is no need for such plants to resort to a chemical defense strate gy in the seeds. In fact, quite the opposite! The plant uses several de vices to attract the predator’s attention, thereby encouraging the predator to eat its offspring. One is color. (For t his reason, all animals that eat fruit have color v ision. 4 ) But the plant doesn’t want its babies to be eaten before th e protective coating is completely hardened, so it uses the color of unripe fruit (usually green) to convey the message “not yet” to the predator. Just in case the predato r can’t interpret this signal, the plant often increases the toxin le vels in the unripe fruit itself to make it absolute ly clear that the time is not right. Before such things as the Granny Smit h apple were introduced to this country, youngsters of my generation who ate green apples learned the hard wa y, via the green apple two-step (diarrhea), not to eat fruit before it was ripe. So, when is the right time for the predator to consume the fruit? Again, the plant uses the color of the fruit to signal to predators that it is ripe, which means that the seed’s hull has hardened—and therefore the sugar co ntent is at its height. Incredibly, the plant has chosen to manufac ture fructose, instead of glucose, as the sugar in the fruit. Glucose raises insulin levels in primates and human s, which initially raises levels of leptin, a hunge r-blocking hormone—but fructose does not. As a result, the pre dator never receives the normal message that it is full, which would signal it to stop eating. (Would it surprise you that great apes gain weight only during the tim e of year when fruit is ripe?) That makes for a win-win for predat or and prey. The animal obtains more calories, and because it keeps eating more and more fruit and therefore more seeds, the plant has a better chance of distributi ng more of its babies. Of course, this is no longer a win-win for most modern humans, who don’t need the additional c alories in ripe fruit that were so essential for hunter-gatherers and our ape relatives. And even if we still needed those calories, until the last few decades, most fruit was availabl e only once a year, in the summer. As will soon bec ome clear, year-round availability is making you sick—and over weight!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Timing Is Everything . . . but Looks Can Be Deceivi ng So as we’ve learned, plants use color to communicat e the message that their fruit is ready to harvest, meaning the mature seed hull is hard and has the best chanc e of making it through the predator’s digestive tra ct unscathed. In this case, green means “stop” and red (and orange and yellow) means “go.” Red, orange, a nd yellow signal sweetness and desirability to your br ain, a concept that food marketers have long known about and employed. Next time you are in the snack food a isle in the supermarket, check out the packaging an d signage and you’ll see that both forms of marketing are dominated by these warm colors. Plants have long taught us to associate red, yellow , and orange colors with ripeness; however, now whe n you buy fruit in North America in December, it was like ly grown in Chile or another country in the Souther n Hemisphere, picked slightly unripe, and then given a blast of ethylene oxide when it arrived at its de stination. The ethylene oxide exposure changes the color to ma ke the fruit appear ripe and ready to eat, but the lectin content remains high because the protective coating of the seed never fully matured and the fruit neve r got the message from the parent plant to reduce the lec tin content. Again, when fruit is allowed to ripen naturally, the parent plant reduces the amount of lectins surr ounding the seeds in the fruit and skin and then communicates this information by changing color. In contrast, gassing artificially changes the color of the fruit, but the lectin protection system rem ains in effect. Thanks to the high lectin count, eating fru it picked too early is detrimental to your health. That’s one reason, in Part II, I recommend that you eat only l ocally grown produce and only during key times duri ng the year. In Europe, most out-of-season fruit is grown in Israel or North Africa. Because it does not have to travel a long distance over several days, it may be picked ripe and not have to be gassed. It’s possib le that eating naturally ripened fruit with lower lectin co ntent helps explain why Europeans are generally hea lthier and slimmer than those of us on the other side of t he “pond.” Biological Warfare IN THE CASE of naked seeds, plants use a divergent strategy. T hese grasses, vines, and other plants that grow out in the open fields have already chosen a fertile sp ot in which to grow. They want their babies to fall in place and take root there. That way, after the parent plants die off in the winter, the babies will sprout the f ollowing season, replacing the earlier generation. There is no advan tage to being carried off, so the plant must discou rage insects or other animals from consuming its babies and transpo rting them elsewhere. Instead of a hard casing, the naked seed contains one or more chemicals that weaken predator s, paralyze them, or make them ill, so they won’t m ake the mistake of eating the plant again. These substances include phytates, often referred to as antinutrien ts, which prevent absorption of minerals in the diet; trypsin inhibitors, which keep digestive enzymes from doin g their job, interfering with the predator’s growth; and lectins , which are designed to disrupt cellular communicat ion by, among other things, causing gaps in the intestinal wall b arrier, a condition known as leaky gut. Whole grain s actually contain all three of these defensive chemicals in t he fibrous hull, husk, and bran. (Teaser alert: Thi s is just one reason that the idea of “whole-grain goodness” is a huge misconception, as you’ll learn in chapter 2.) Still other plant-predator dissuaders include tanni ns, which impart a bitter taste, and the alkaloids found in the stems and leaves of the nightshade family. You may alread y know that nightshades, which include such culinar y favorites as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers, are highly inflammatory. We’ll come back to the nightsh ade family, which also includes goji berries, as well as to gra ins and to beans and other legumes, later. Do Plants Think? PLOTTING TO HARM us?

Think about that th e next time you encounter a jalapeño pepper. Did you know that a plant knows when it is being ea ten? Well, as recent research reveals, it does, but it doesn’t just sit there and accept its fate. It deploys troops to defend itself, in an effort to stop the predator. 5 In this case, the research subject was a plant called thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana), a member of the cabbage family. Thale cress was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, s o researchers have a better understanding of its in ner workings than of most other plants. To find out if the plant was aware of being eaten, the scientists re-create d the vibrations that a caterpillar makes as it eats the leaves. The y also recorded other vibrations that the plant mig ht experience, such as that of wind blowing. Sure enough, the cres s responded to the vibrations that mimic a munching caterpillar by upping its production of mildly toxic mustard oi ls and delivering them to the leaves to deter preda tors. The plant showed no response to wind or other vibrations. Another example is the sensitive plant ( Mimosa pudica ), which is deserving of its name. It has learned t o protect itself from being disturbed, which includes being e aten, by defensively folding its leaves in response to touch. In fact, the leaf-folding behavior is more pronounced and persistent when it grows in an area where it ha s been particularly subject to interference than when it g rows in an undisturbed area. 6 Whoa! Thinking, reasoning plants! This isn’t their first rodeo either. Plants also respond to circadian rhythms, just as h umans and other animals do. 7 In one study, researchers found that the so-called clock gene in plants determines the t ime of day a plant will produce an insecticide to c oincide with the time a predator is likely to be on the prowl. When the researcher removed the clock gene from the plan t, it lost its ability to produce the toxin. 8 Finally, let’s focus on the plant chemical you had probably never heard of until you picked up this bo ok: lectins. Yes, you are reading that word correctly. It is lec tin, not lecithin (a fatty substance in a plant or animal) or leptin (the appetite-regulating hormone mentioned above). When bugs start eating leaves on one side of a plan t, the lectin content doubles almost immediately on the other sid e, 9 as the plant valiantly struggles to dissuade furthe r consumption. As you’ll come to learn, lectins play a key role in the defensive strategies that plants use to protect themselves, and they also play a key role in harmin g us. Edible Enemies SO, WHAT ARE lectins anyway? For the most part, with one import ant exception, they are large proteins found in plants and animals, and they are a crucial weapon i n the arsenal of strategies that plants use to defe nd themselves in their ongoing battle with animals. Scientists disco vered lectins in 1884 as part of their investigatio n into different blood types. Until now, you have probably been fami liar with only one famous—or, rather, infamous—lect in: gluten. There are many more, and soon I’ll introduc e you to the most important of these—and believe me , you’ll want to know them. (Just as a teaser, 94 percent of humans are born with antibodies to the lectin in p eanuts.) How exactly do lectins help plants defend themselve s? Well, lectins in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds , and leaves of most plants bind to carbohydrates (sugars), and par ticularly to complex sugars called polysaccharides, in the predator’s body after it consumes the plant. Like s mart bombs, lectins target and attach themselves to sugar molecules, primarily on the surface of the cells of other organisms—particularly fungi, insects, and o ther animals. They also bind to sialic acid, a sugar molecule fou nd in the gut, in the brain, between nerve endings, in joints, and in all bodily fluids, including the blood vessel linin g of all creatures. Lectins are sometimes referred to as “sticky proteins” because of this binding process, which me ans they can interrupt messaging between cells or o therwise cause toxic or inflammatory reactions, 10 as we’ll discuss later. For example, when lectins b ind to sialic acid, one"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"cause toxic or inflammatory reactions, 10 as we’ll discuss later. For example, when lectins b ind to sialic acid, one nerve is unable to communicate its information to a nother nerve. If you have ever experienced brain fo g, thank lectins. Lectins also facilitate the attachment and binding of viruses and bacteria to their intended targets. Believe it or not, some people—those who are more sensitive to lectins—are therefore more subject to viruses and bacterial infections than others. Think about that if you see m to get sick more often than your friends do. In addition to the potential to cause health proble ms, lectins can also stimulate weight gain. The rea son that wheat became the grain of choice in northern climates is thanks to a uniquely small lectin in wheat, known a s wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is responsible for wheat’s weight-gaining propensity. You read that correctly. Wheat helped your ancestors gain or maintain weight in an cient times when food was often scarce; back then, a “wheat belly” was a great thing to possess! And guess what ? That WGA in the “ancient” forms of wheat is just as present in modern wheat—hence the weight gain. We will explore these implications further in the following chapte rs. A plant will do just about anything to keep your mo uth off its seeds and save its babies, including sa crificing its leaves. By design, lectins either kill any animal t hat dares to eat it outright or at the very least m ake that animal feel unwell. After all, a weakened enemy is more vulnera ble. Assuming they survive their initial encounter with such a plant, insects and other animals quickly learn not to eat any plant (or its seeds) that makes them fee l bad or fail to thrive. The animal decides that that plant is not w orth eating and moves on to greener fields and othe r species, while the plant and its babies survive. Again, it’s a win -win situation and the détente prevails. Ancient humans developed a host of ways to deal wit h lectins. Unfortunately, modern humans aren’t so s avvy. Instead, if we eat something that doesn’t agree wit h us or makes us sick, we find or invent something— think Nexium, a stomach-acid reducer, or a drug such as i buprofen that lessens pain—so we can continue to ea t a substance designed to destroy, cause pain in, or at least weaken us. Speaking of stomach acid, get this: Not only do we keep eating foods that are designed to hurt us, but we also feed them to animals in the food chain, which suffer sim ilarly from their diet. Left to their own devices, cows would never consume corn and soybeans—their natural diet is grasses and other forage—but that is exactly wha t they are fed on industrial farms. The lectins in corn and so y are far more effective than grass in making the c ow heavier and giving them a better ratio of fat. (That same corn and grain in processed foods bulk you up as well, a s you will learn in chapter 5.) Both soy and corn are laden with lec tins foreign to cows, causing them to develop such severe heartburn and pain in swallowing that they actually stop eating. Yes, cows develop heartburn from thes e lectins, just as you do. To keep their beasts eating more of this fattening food, farmers dose them with calcium car bonate, the active ingredient in Tums. 11 In fact, half of the world’s production of this com pound is added to cattle feed to stop the heartburn, ensuring that cows continue to eat t heir unnatural diet of corn and soybeans. You Really Are What You Eat THE LECTINS IN beans and other legumes, wheat and other grains, a nd certain other plants are especially problematic for humans. First, not enough time has elapsed to allow our species to develop immunologic al tolerance to these substances; nor has sufficient t ime elapsed for the human gut microbiome to become fully capable of breaking down these proteins. Numerous h ealth problems are the result, with gastric distres s as just the tip of the iceberg. (If you are impatient to know t he range of the resultant potential health problems , turn to this list , and prepare to be shocked.) Such plants are not the only place in which you’ll encounter lectins; they also turn up in animal products. When cows and other animals eat gr ain- or soy-based feed, both of which are full of l ectins, these proteins wind up in the animals’ milk or meat. The same thing happens with the meat and eggs of chicke ns raised on feed full of lectins. Ditto for farm-raised seaf ood, which dine on soy and corn as well. Until I sa w firsthand in many of my “canaries” how removing such foods from their diet was the final key to restored health, I would not have believed this. In the mid-1980s, a personal experience effectively drove this point home. I had moved my wife and two young daughters to London, where I was a heart surgery fe llow at Great Ormond Street, the renowned children’ s hospital. At that time, chickens in England were fed primaril y ground-up fish meal. My girls missed their favori te American"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"At that time, chickens in England were fed primaril y ground-up fish meal. My girls missed their favori te American food of fried chicken, so as a special treat I took them to the only KFC in town for dinner. No sooner had they bitten into a piece of chicken than they turned up their n oses, claiming it was fish, not chicken. I tried to persuade them it was indeed chicken, but in a way, they were right. Because it had been fed fish, the chicken was actua lly a fish. At that time, I didn’t give any thought to the fact th at a chicken fed corn or soybeans isn’t actually a chicken, but instead a clucking, walking grain or bean. As the old saying goes, “You are what you eat.” But you are also what the thing you ate, ate. When you consume organically raised produce and pastured animal prod ucts—and I do not mean free-range—the nutrients in the plants and the nutrients the plants got from the soil (as well as the plants the animals ate) pass into your body and are incorporated into every one of your cells. Knowing how the food you eat was grown and raised is not ju st a lifestyle choice; it also directly affects your health. There is now conclusive evidence that organically g rown vegetables and fruits do contain more vitamins and minerals than conventionally grown produce, 12 but, more important, they contain more polyphenols. (Without getting too technical, these beneficial plant chemi cals are found in tea, coffee, fruits and berries, and some vegetables.) The same applies to eating pastured an imal foods. But the implications of being what you eat (or what the thing you ate, ate) don’t stop there. The lecti ns in the grain and soy fed to conventionally raise d animals end up in the flesh, milk, or eggs of these animals, and u ltimately in your gut, where they can still work th eir damage. Even organic and so-called free-range animals conta in these lectins because they, too, are fed soy and corn, albeit organic versions. (And by the way, it is perfectly legal to keep an animal inside a warehouse its enti re life and call it free-range, as long as a door to the outside is ope n for a mere five minutes a day. Never mind that it is unlikely that any single bird packed cheek by jowl with thousands of other chickens ever manages to work its way to this door.) There is a vast difference in a burger (or milk or cheese) made from a cow that grazed on grass in the summer and ate hay in the winter and a burger made from an ani mal raised in a stockyard on lectin-rich corn and s oy. 13 To start, there’s the difference in the ratio of omega-3 to o mega-6 fats. With certain exceptions, omega-6 fats are inflammatory and omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory . Corn and soy contain primarily omega-6 fats, whil e grass is high in omega-3 fats. But there’s more to it than t hat. Remarkably, those same soybeans and grains mak e cows much fatter than do the equivalent number of calori es in grass. 14 This means that the source of calories plays an important role in how you metabolize them. Keep tha t in mind when we discuss weight gain. And compound ing the issue, of course, is that in the United States, alm ost all soy and corn is also produced from genetica lly modified seed. We’ll delve further into the effects of consu ming GMO foods in chapter 4. SUCCESS STORY Life After Chicken Yvonne K., a fifty-year-old Los Angeles woman, had severe lupus with joint pain, fatigue, and rashes, despite taking immune-suppressing drugs and practic ing meditation. After a friend suggested she see me , I put her on the Plant Paradox Program. Within a mont h, the joint pain, fatigue, and most of the rashes had resolved. She stopped her immunosuppressant medicat ions and continued to do well. When I saw Yvonne about four months later, she was ecstatic about wha t had happened, except for some persistent eczema o n her eyelids. She told me she was vigilant about avoidin g all bad foods, and we went over the lists of good foods and bad foods with a fine-tooth comb. When we got t o the good food list, I asked if she was eating any chicken. She replied that she ate only organic free -range chicken. And that’s when we figured it out: she was effectively eating what the chickens had eaten—name ly, corn and soybeans. She was an indirect grain an d legume eater! We immediately removed chicken from h er diet, and sure enough, within two weeks Yvonne’s eczema vanished. Three years later, it is still gon e, and so is the free-range chicken."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Balance of Power SO, WHERE DO humans stand in the war between the plant and anim al worlds? Are we just pushovers for the damage that plant lectins and other chemicals can i nflict on our poor bodies? Not at all. It’s importa nt to understand that although lectins can be toxic or inflammatory and have the ability to mess with your body’s inter nal messaging system, all animals, including humans, have develop ed their own defensive systems to render lectins ha rmless or at least mitigate their effects. A four-pronged defens e mechanism protects us from the toxic effects of p lants, and specifically of lectins. 1. THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE is the mucus in your nose and saliva in your mouth , collectively called mucopolysaccharides (meaning many sugars). G uess what those sugars are there for? To trap lecti ns. Remember, lectins like to bind to sugars. The next time your nose runs after eating spicy foods, you’l l know that you’ve just eaten some lectins. That extra dos e of mucus not only traps the lectins you just ate but also adds an additional coating to your esophagus as you r meal works its way down. 2. THE SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE is stomach acid, which in many cases does the job of digesting certain lectin proteins, although not all of them. 3. THE THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE is the bacteria in your mouth and gut (part of you r microbiome), which have evolved to efficiently consume lectins b efore they have the opportunity to interact with th e wall of your gut. The longer you have been eating partic ular plant lectins, the longer you have been produc ing gut bacteria specifically designed to defuse them. 15 That’s why if you eliminate all gluten from your di et, the gluten-eating bugs die off; then when you do revert to eating gluten or eat something you don’t realiz e contains gluten, you cannot digest them, causing di scomfort. 4. THE FOURTH AND FINAL LINE OF DEFENSE is a layer of mucus produced by certain cells throughout your intestines. Like the mucus in your nose, mouth, throat, and extending all the way to y our anus, this layer of gut mucus acts as a barrier. It keeps the plant compounds you have eaten in the gu t where they belong, using the sugars in the mucus to trap and absorb lectins. If you’re a Star Wars or Star Trek fan, think of this mucosal layer as an activated force s hield! Taken all together, it’s an effective system. Never theless, the more troops in the form of lectins thr own at these defenses, the more the sugar molecules in the mucou s layer are used up, and the more likely lectins ar e to get where they really want to go: the living cells that line your gut. This is where the rubber meets the road. Of course, you do have another powerful weapon to e mploy in your battle with lectins—your brain. Once you know that certain foods are problematic, you should avoi d them, eat them rarely, or mitigate their effects with the sorts of preparation methods our forebears long knew about, which we’ll discuss in good time. You’ll also soon learn why the use of drugs that eliminate stomach acid and th e adoption of a completely gluten-free diet are ill advised except in that small portion of the population diagnosed w ith celiac disease. Once you understand more about your gut and the microbes that call it home, you can use your br ain to better correct these missteps. So there you have the human defense strategy—and I’ ll share with you the specifics of how to fortify y our defenses in Part II—but like the setup for an NFL football g ame, let’s now look at the lectin offensive lineup. Plants attack your formidable defense system with their own three -pronged approach, making you feel sick on several fronts. LECTIN ATTACK STRATEGY #1: Get Through the Gut Wall The first mission of lectins is to pry apart what a re called tight junctions between the cells in the mucosal wall lining your intestine. Believe it or not, the lining of yo ur intestine is only one cell thick, while its surf ace area is equivalent to the size of a tennis court. 16 Imagine that a wall just a single cell thick is res ponsible for manning this huge border. Your intestinal cells absorb vitamins, minerals, fa ts, sugars, and simple proteins, but not large prot eins—and lectins"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Your intestinal cells absorb vitamins, minerals, fa ts, sugars, and simple proteins, but not large prot eins—and lectins are relatively large proteins. If all is well with your gut health and its mucous layers, lectins shou ld not be able to squeeze past the mucosal cells. But if you ever eng aged in the old playground game of red rover, think of how the big kids tried to pry your arms apart to break thro ugh the line. That’s exactly what happens when lect ins attack your mucosal wall. 17 If one or more of the four lines of defense detaile d above are breached, lectins can pry apart the tig ht junctions in the intestinal wall by binding with receptors on ce rtain cells to produce a chemical compound called z onulin. Zonulin opens up the spaces between the cells of th e intestinal lining, which enables lectins to acces s the surrounding tissues, lymph nodes and glands, or blo odstream, where they have no business being. Once t here, they act like any foreign protein, prompting your body’s immune system to attack them. Think of when you ge t a splinter under your skin, and how your body’s respo nse is to attack the splinter with white blood cell s, creating swelling and redness. While you can’t see that resp onse to lectins gaining access to off-limits territ ory in your body, I assure you that invading lectins prompt your immu ne system to respond in a similar fashion. I routin ely see this when I measure inflammatory cytokines, which act li ke air raid sirens to alert the immune system to an incoming threat. LECTIN ATTACK STRATEGY #2: Confuse the Immune System with Molecular Mimic ry There are many examples in the animal kingdom of cr eatures that mimic other species to their own advan tage. Some moths mimic spiders to get their spider predat ors to leave them alone. The harmless scarlet king snake looks remarkably like the deadly coral snake, creating a powerful deterrent to predators. Likewise, plants m ay mimic birds or insects to keep from being eaten by them. One in sect, the well-named walking stick, looks just like a dried twig, helping protect it from predators. Therefore, we sh ouldn’t be surprised to discover that plants purpos ely make lectins that are virtually indistinguishable from o ther proteins in your body, a tactic called molecul ar mimicry. Lectins are nearly indistinguishable from certain o ther proteins in your body. By mimicking such prote ins, lectins fool the host’s immune system, causing it to attack the body’s own proteins. Or the lectins bind to ce ll receptors, acting like a hormone or blocking a hormone, thus d isrupting communications within the body and wreaki ng havoc (see below). I’m sure that on more than one occasio n, you have had a passerby hail you down, using som eone else’s name, only to apologize when he or she realizes it is a case of mistaken identity. Molecular mimicry i s similarly a case of inappropriate pattern matching. Our immune system cells and other cells use “bar-co de” scanners called TLRs (toll-like receptors) to i dentify proteins as friend or foe. These pattern receptors, built over hundreds of millions of years, have bee n subjected to new patterns in certain foods that unfortunately mi mic a whole different set of compounds that instruc t cells— particularly, immune and fat cells—what to do. For instance, these compounds instruct fat cells to sto re fat when they shouldn’t be storing fat, or they tell our whi te blood cells to attack our own bodies in a case o f mistaken identity. Some of these compounds are so new that m ost of our ancestors never encountered them until f ive hundred years ago. And some, the really bad ones, we’ve enc ountered for only the last fifty years! We’ll go in to greater detail on the insidious effects of molecular mimicr y in chapter 2. LECTIN ATTACK STRATEGY #3: Disrupt Cellular Communication Some lectins also disrupt transmissions between you r cells by mimicking or blocking hormonal signals. 18 Hormones are proteins that fit into actual docking ports on the walls of all cells and release informa tion about what the hormone wants a cell to do. For example, the ho rmone insulin enables cells to allow glucose to ent er and provide fuel. If there is excess glucose, insulin a ttaches to fat cells and directs them to store the glucose as fat for use when there’s less food. Once the hormone releas es information, the cell informs the hormone that t he message has been received and the hormone backs out of the dock, so the dock is ready for the next hormone. In order to do any of these things, the docking port for insulin h as to be open and available. However, lectins can b ind to important docking ports on cell walls, either givin g wrong information or blocking release of the corr ect"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"important docking ports on cell walls, either givin g wrong information or blocking release of the corr ect information. For example, the lectin WGA bears a st riking resemblance to insulin. 19 It can attach to the insulin docking port as if it were the actual insulin molec ule, but unlike the real hormone, it never lets go— with devastating results, including reduced muscle mass, starved bra in and nerve cells, and plenty of fat. Ouch! A Plant-Based Diet JUST TO REITERATE , I am not anti-vegetable. Far from it! And therein lies the paradox. We may be at war with plants, but they (or at least most of them) contain the vitamins, minerals, and a long list of flavono ids, antioxidants, polyphenols, and other micronutrients essential for our microbiome’s health—and, consequently, our hea lth. The Plant Paradox Program is actually a microbiome- and mitochondria-centric program that recommends a diverse array of the right plant foods at the right time, p repared the right way, in the right amounts. By the time you have finished reading this book, you’ll know exactly whi ch plant foods to eat, which to avoid, and how to p repare certain foods to mitigate the impact of lectins. But you wo n’t subsist on plants alone. The source of most of the animal protein you’ll be eating is wild seafood, so I call this program a “vegaquarian” diet. Naturally, as a longtime professor at Loma Linda University School of Medici ne, a Seventh-day Adventist vegetarian institution, I also provide an empowering approach for vegetarians and vegans to achieve optimal health. Half of my patients seek me out because they have f ailed to show improvement on other famous gut-heali ng regimens, such as the GAPS diet, the SCD, and the L ow FODMAP diet. What my colleagues in gut health do n’t recognize is that while numerous factors are import ant in healing leaky gut, you must remove the offen ding proteins that are forcing the wall of the gut open in the fi rst place. Until you do this, you are merely doing the equivalent of bailing water out of a leaky boat. Unless you fill the holes and stop making new ones, the boat (and y ou) will continue to sink. Fortunately, there are ways to outwit the damaging effects of lectins, which I will reveal in the foll owing chapters. Following the three phases of the Plant Paradox Pro gram, you will initially remove the most problemati c lectins so that you can heal your gut. Most people can later r eintroduce some lectins, properly pretreated, in mo deration. Nor is everyone equally sensitive to individual lectins . The longer your ancestors had been eating a certa in leaf or other plant part that contains a lectin, the more opportu nity your immune system and microbiome had to evolv e to tolerate that lectin. At some point, they both evol ve to merely shrug their shoulders when confronted with this particular protein. In the next chapter, we’ll delve deeper into the wo rld of lectins to understand how they are leading t he charge in the war within your body. We’ll also explode the myth o f many so-called healthy foods, which, as you’ll le arn, are actually the hidden cause of heart disease, diabete s, arthritis, obesity, and all autoimmune diseases."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 Lectins on the Loose Now that you’ve been introduced to the mischievous proteins known as lectins, let’s address the obviou s questions: If our forebears have been eating most of these lec tin-containing foods for thousands of years, why ar e they only now undermining our health? And what, if anything, has changed in recent years to make that the case? This is where it gets really interesting. Lectins h ave actually been making trouble for humans for tho usands of years. Through trial and error, any animal, includi ng our own species, learned which plants to avoid. But about one hundred thousand years ago, humans made a discovery that catapulted us past all other creatures in our war with plants: fire! Cooking partially breaks down many le ctins. Plus, it is an easy way to break apart the c ell wall of a plant. Previously, only gut bacteria were capable o f both feats. This allowed our early ancestors to e volve in a way that dramatically lessened the amount of energy (an d surface area of the intestines) required for dige stion—a change that made calories more accessible to our en ergy-demanding brain. While not a perfect solution, cooking also allowed us to utilize the underground starch s torage system of plants called tubers—think of swee t potatoes— by breaking down these previously indigestible plan t compounds. After cooking came about, things were looking prett y good for Homo sapiens for about ninety thousand years. Plentiful animals and tubers produced tall, robust humans. In fact, up until ten thousand years ago, t he average human stood about six feet tall. But when the last Ice Age ended, trouble began. The huge beasts that thrived in the cold rapidly died off, requiring a new resource for calories for mankind. Enter agriculture and the do mestication of grains and beans (legumes) in the fertile triangle of the Middle East. Both could be stored and used l ater, unlike fruit, which needs to be consumed when ripe. The cu ltivation of grains and legumes was the ultimate do uble-edged sword of the plant paradox. Entirely new lectins en tered our guts for the first time in millions of ye ars, and we were, and still are—excuse the pun—ill prepared. But as y ou’ll soon understand, grains and beans were both t he best and worst things that could have happened to our specie s. Two Types of Lectins IN THE LAST chapter, you learned about two kinds of seeds, tho se with and without hard casings. You also learned about the two divergent defensive strategie s plants use—either to deter predators from eating their seeds or conversely to encourage predators to eat and transp ort them. Not surprisingly, plant predators also fa ll into two categories. Grazers evolved to consume single-leaf plants (monocotyledons, or monocots, for short), wh ich we tend to think of mostly as grasses or grains. Meanwhile, tree dwellers evolved to consume tree leaves and o ther two-leaf plants (bicotyledons) and their fruits. The lectins in one-leaf plants are totally different from the lectins in two-leaf plants, so the sets of gut microbes in grazers and tree dwellers also evolved in two distinct paths. G ut microbes in grazers digest the lectins in single-leaf plants, w hile the tree dwellers have a different set of micr obes capable of processing the lectins in two-leaf plants. We know that the longer you are exposed to a compou nd, the more you become tolerant of it and don’t vi gorously react to it. Think of how allergy shots give you a little dose of an allergen until eventually you can handle that food or other substance. But in this case, the time fram e necessary for us to come to tolerate certain lect ins isn’t weeks or months; rather, it is millennia. The predecessors of cows, sheep, antelope, and othe r grazers have had millions and millions of years t o develop and pass on microbes capable of handling lectins in sin gle-leaf plants. By handling, of course, I mean dig esting and eliminating those lectins; and if not eliminating t hese lectins, then “educating” the immune system no t to be overly bothered, since it has been encountering them for m illions of years. Mice and rats evolved as grain ea ters at least 40"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"bothered, since it has been encountering them for m illions of years. Mice and rats evolved as grain ea ters at least 40 million years ago and have had far longer to become tolerant of these lectins: on the order of four th ousand times longer than we humans. Rodents also have hundreds o f times more enzymes called proteases in their gut to break down lectins in seeds, which means a rodent’s intes tinal wall is not under the constant threat that le ctins pose to your gut. We humans certainly aren’t grazers, at least in the original use of the term. (We do love to graze on snack foods all day! But I can assure you that the Plant Paradox Pr ogram will cure you of that tendency.) Therefore, w e are categorized as tree dwellers, or at least the desce ndants of a long line of tree dwellers that initial ly were tree shrews. I know. That may seem hard to believe, but it was a t least 40 million years ago. And over that time, t he microbes that now call your body home and can handle the lec tins of two-leaf plants were passed down from gener ation to generation. 1 Four Cataclysmic Changes in the Human Diet OUR GUT BACTERIA play an important role in “educating” our immune s ystem as to which compounds should be accepted as relatively harmless and allowed in, and which are cause for concern and should be barre d from entry. 2 This “border patrol” known as our immune system has been built over 80 million years, beginning long b efore Homo sapiens emerged. But only relatively recently have we (and our microbes) been subjected to new patterns in certain foods. Unfortunately, compounds in these fo ods mimic a whole different set of compounds that t ell our cells, particularly immune and fat cells, what to do. The four major disruptions in human eating patterns outlined below have upset the sophisticated balanc e of power between plants and humans, which allowed both of us to coexist and thrive for millennia. Each of these disruptions has forced us to accommodate (or not) a changing di et. And it’s only recently that we have uncovered t he role that lectins play in this disruption. The epidemics of o besity, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems provide proof positive that we are now losing this war. To unders tand why this is happening now and what we can do a bout it, let’s take a short trip back to mankind’s ancient o rigins. CHANGE #1: The Agricultural Revolution The advent of the agricultural revolution about ten thousand years ago meant that a totally new source of food— grain and beans—became the dietary staple of most c ultures relatively quickly. At that point, the huma n diet shifted from primarily leaves, tubers, and some animal fat and protein to primarily grains and beans. Until th en, the human microbiome had never encountered lectins in grasses (grains) or legumes, and therefore the human gut b acteria, microbes, and immune system had zero experience han dling them. Fast-forward five thousand years or so. Thanks to i ts granaries full of wheat, ancient Egypt was able to feed its people, including the slaves who built its pyramids , enabling its rise to a great kingdom. However, an alysis of thousands of Egyptian mummified remains has reveale d the health status of those wheat eaters, and it w asn’t good. They died overweight, with clogged arteries. Their teeth were also decayed from a diet high in grains, which are full of simple sugars, and worn down to the gums from gr inding the grains. 3 The mummified remains of Queen Nefertiti suggest that she most likely had diabetes . The legendary queen was not the only one with pro blems related to her grain-heavy diet. In fact, oatmeal has been associated with dental problems even in modern time s. In 1932, researchers found that putting young children with dental cavities and malformed teeth on a diet free of oatmeal but fortified with vitamin D and cod liver oil for a pe riod of six months resulted in almost complete elim ination of both new cavities and regression in the growth of existi ng ones. 4 These results were dramatically better than previou s efforts using only vitamin D supplementation but th at allowed the children to continue to consume oatm eal. To varying degrees, we can see that the lectins in oats and other grains, legumes, and certain other p lants have always been toxic—but given the choice between star vation and some serious health trade-offs, humans w ill always opt for survival.

Our ancestors did come up with wa ys to minimize the effects of lectins once the agri cultural revolution brought them to our plates, using fermen tation and various other ingenious preparation tech niques. And clearly, without grains and beans, civilization as we know it would not have occurred. CHANGE #2: A Mutation in Cows About two thousand years ago, a spontaneous mutatio n in Northern European cows caused them to make the protein casein A-1 in their milk instead of the normal case in A-2. During digestion, casein A-1 is turned into a lectinlike protein called beta-casomorphin. This protein attac hes to the pancreas’s insulin-producing cells, know n as beta cells, which prompts an immune attack on the pancre as of people who consume milk from these cows or ch eeses made from it. 5 This is likely a primary cause of type 1 diabetes. 6 Southern European cows, goats, and sheep continue to produce casein A-2 milk, but because ca sein A-1 cows are hardier and produce more milk, fa rmers prefer them. The most common breed of cows worldwid e is the Holstein, whose milk contains this problem atic lectinlike protein. If you think that drinking milk gives you a problem, it’s almost certainly the cow ’s breed that is at fault, not milk per se. The black and white Holstei n is the classic example of the A-1 cow, while the Guernsey, Brown Swiss, and Belgian Blues are all casein A-2. That’s why I recommend that if you consume dairy, y ou opt for only casein A-2 dairy products, which grocery store s have recently started selling, particularly on th e West Coast. Alternatively, use goat or sheep milk products to b e safe. SUCCESS STORY It’s the Breed of Cow! Allison M., a longtime sufferer of rheumatoid arthr itis, came to me for help. In her fifties, she had decided that spending the rest of her life on immune-suppre ssing drugs, which might promote cancer, was too mu ch to deal with. Instead, she stopped the drugs and st arted the Plant Paradox Program. She began to thriv e, and her pain disappeared—and with it the inflammatory m arkers. But it was the call I got from the Napa Val ley that makes this success story so poignant. It seems that Allison was visiting a girlfriend who offered her some yogurt from grass-fed cows on a nearby farm, k nowing that she was on this “crazy Gundry diet.” My patient declined, saying that it wasn’t the right b reed of cow, which made her friend belittle the die t, saying that was ridiculous. As if the breed of cow made a difference! Allison laughed and agreed that it was silly, and that surely a little bit couldn’t hurt. So to b e polite, she ate a couple of tablespoons of yogurt . That night she awoke with three finger joints in her left hand swollen and bright red. She called me, not in pani c, but in delight! It was the breed of cow, after all. She told me that neve r had anything that hurt so badly felt so good, because now she knew that she had the secret formul a for lifelong good health. CHANGE #3 : Plants from the New World It would seem that we should have become pretty tol erant of these new lectins over the past ten thousa nd years, but let’s take one more trip back in time. Five centuri es ago, the last of the major changes in lectin exp osure—and perhaps the biggest disruption of all—occurred when Europeans reached the Americas. The explorers brou ght New World foods back to their native countries, and the Columbian Exchange, named after Christopher Columb us, exposed the rest of the world to a whole array of n ew lectins. They include the nightshade family, mos t of the bean family (legumes, including peanuts and cashews), gr ains, pseudo-grains such as amaranth and quinoa, th e squash family (pumpkins, acorn squash, zucchini), and chia and certain other seeds. All are foods that until then no European, Asian, or African had ever seen, much les s eaten. Half of the foods you have been told to ea t for good health are actually New World plants that most of m ankind had no prior exposure to, meaning your body, your gut bacteria, and your immune system are ill prepared t o tolerate them. Getting to know a new lectin in fi ve hundred"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"bacteria, and your immune system are ill prepared t o tolerate them. Getting to know a new lectin in fi ve hundred years is equivalent to speed dating in evolution! CHANGE #4: Contemporary Innovations In the last five decades we have faced yet another unleashing of lectins in processed foods and most r ecently in genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including so ybeans, corn, tomatoes, and rapeseed (canola). Our bodies have never before encountered any of these lectins. Moreover, with the introduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics, other drugs, and a vast array of chemicals, we have totally destroyed the gut bacteria that would have normally given us a chance to process these lectins and educ ate our immune system about them. We’ll discuss the se deadly disruptors further in chapter 4. All four of these factors have profoundly disrupted normal messaging within our bodies. There is no wa y we (and our microbiome) can adapt to deal with these onslau ghts of lectins in such a short time span. (Just th ink about those poor cows that had never encountered corn and soy l ectins until about sixty years ago and are treated with Tums in order to get them to eat their weight-promoting new food.) This is particularly true if we make a prac tice of killing most of our microbiome daily by ingesting certain m edications, including antibiotics, and other substa nces such as artificial sweeteners. It’s akin to expecting one o f the first personal computers developed in the 197 0s, with perhaps 250 bytes of memory, to allow you to stream videos, check your Facebook page, pay bills, reserve airli ne tickets, order groceries, and perform countless other functi ons now possible on even the most basic modern-day computers. Why Now? IF ONLY ONE of these four factors is based on modern-day chang es, why are we suddenly so much more sensitive to lectins today? The answer to that ques tion is nuanced. As we discussed in the contemporar y innovations section above, several recent changes have impacted how we respond to lectins. The pace of these shift s is approaching warp speed, outpacing our ability—and t hat of our microbiome—to adapt in a comparable time frame. In the last half century, we have abandoned many of the tried-and-true ways of eating and preparing fo ods, opting instead for fast food, processed food, ultraprocess ed food, microwave meals, and on and on. The makeup of our diet has also changed significantly. Corn, soy, and whea t, all packed with lectins, are in most processed f oods. The lectin load on humans is higher than ever before, but ther e’s much more to the story. In this same five-decad e time span, an onslaught of herbicides, biocides, drugs, fertil izers, food additives, skin-care products, and a ho st of other chemicals has also disrupted your internal messagin g system, your gut, and the microbes in your gut. T hat chemical overload has compromised your ability to deal with grains, legumes, and other lectin-bearing plants. As I alerted you in the Introduction, much of what I will be telling you can initially be difficult to accept. It may make you question the very concept of who you are. It will challenge your notions of what causes healt h and disease. It will upend your concepts of what consti tutes healthy foods, good foods, bad foods, and eve n organic foods—and it will certainly make you question the U .S. Dietary Guidelines. At the most basic level, I want you to understand why you cannot ignore the past in order to enjoy a long, healthy future. Our present-day food supply looks very different fr om the one that sustained people for generations. Consider this: In just the last fifty years, the fo llowing significant changes have taken place: • We now eat far more wheat, corn, and other grai ns, as well as soybeans, in the form of processed f oods, which have displaced unprocessed carbohydrates, inc luding leafy greens and other vegetables. 7 • More than 43 percent of the average household f ood budget is spent outside the home, up from just under 26 percent in 1970. 8 • Instead of home-cooked meals, we increasingly r ely on prepared foods to pop in the microwave, ultraprocessed foods full of questionable ingredien ts, and take-out meals."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"• We have forgotten (or ignored) tried-and-true w ays to neutralize the negative effects of consuming certain lectin-containing foods. • Many once-familiar plants are now grown using p etrochemical fertilizers and modified to be more pe st resistant, ripen sooner, minimize or eliminate brui sing or denting, and to make other changes that inc rease production and facilitate moving produce long dista nces. • Even our healthy vegetables are not being raise d with the eons-old help of soil bacteria, which ha ve been wiped out by modern farming techniques and biocides . Levels of zinc and magnesium, key elements that prevent diabetes and metabolic syndrome, in the soi l have also dropped significantly. 9 • Although we don’t necessarily connect them to o besity and other health problems, nonfood products such as over-the-counter and prescribed drugs, room freshen ers, hand sanitizers, and countless other disruptor s are not just a problem in their own right but also compound the negative effects of eating lectins. What Is Healthy Food? AS YOUR HEALTH is so dependent on your diet, it all depends upon your choice of foods and their relative amounts, as well as the preparation techniques you use. But ironically, most of my patients with disea se conditions were already eating “healthy”! Or at least so they thought. In my original diet plan for my patients, I banishe d white foods such as flour, sugar, potatoes, and m ilk, and limited brown foods such as certain whole grains and legume s. But when I subsequently removed all grains and all pseudo- grains (quinoa, buckwheat, and the like) along with all legumes, including tofu, edamame, and other so y products, my patients experienced even greater improvements. It seemed that the more supposedly healthy foods th at I eliminated, the more their health improved. Their c ancers regressed or disappeared—yes, you read that right—as did their type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune diseases. How could t hat be? After all, we’ve been eating these healthy foods for thou sands of years. Or have we? Many foods, including those that contain lectins, h ave both good and bad properties. Additionally, ind ividuals have different tolerances for lectins, depending upon th e state of their health. But to a large extent, you r individual health depends on the health of your gut lining, your micr obiome, and its instructions to your immune system. And it’s become clear to me that lectins are leading the cha rge in the war within your body. Even when organically raised, certain lectin-heavy foods are the cause of so-called autoimmune disease s, while lectin avoidance in my patients and as reported in scientific literature has been found to cure autoim mune diseases. 10 These claims may seem outrageous, but the evidence walks in and out of my waiting room every day. In o ne study, twenty women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were put on a water fast, during which the RA disap peared in all twenty—and when they were put on a vegan diet f ollowing that, half remained in remission, meaning that their gut had healed. But the RA recurred in the other 50 percent of the patients on the vegan diet. 11 In fact, my studies have shown that eating “healthy” lectin-rich foods causes RA. We need to reframe our definition of wha t defines healthy, which should include limiting the intake o f lectin-rich foods. SUCCESS STORY Hoping for a Second Child Beautiful and full of life, twenty-seven-year-old S uzanna K. and her husband were seeking my help. Sho rtly after delivering her first child, Suzanna had devel oped devastating rheumatoid arthritis. She was plac ed on steroids and an immunosuppressant drug, but she sti ll had extremely swollen joints. Any movement was painful, making it impossible to hold her child. Mo reover, she and her husband desperately wanted anot her baby, but they knew that being on these drugs made it too dangerous for Suzanna to contemplate another pregnancy."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Suzanna was ready to try anything. Her blood work s howed that even on these powerful drugs, her immune system was nonetheless in full attack mode. Her tes ts also showed the marker for lectin sensitivity. S o we instituted the Plant Paradox Program and stopped he r medications. It was tough going at first. We used natural anti-inflammatory compounds such as boswell ia extract and high-dose fish oil and vitamin D 3 . With each passing week, her pain began to subside and he r inflammation markers slowly descended, approachin g normal. She could now play with her son without pai n, and lift or hold him without wincing. About a ye ar into her program, I met with her again, along with her husband and mother, who had both joined the pro gram to help her stick with it. I told her that her mark ers had improved to the point where I thought she c ould try to get pregnant. Her face lit up mischievously. “I kne w you would say that,” she declared, “so I jumped t he gun. I just got the test back, and I’m four weeks pregna nt!” Suzanna recently gave birth to a normal baby girl, and unlike the first go-round, her rheumatoid arthr itis hasn’t flared seven months postpartum. And how about her husband and mother? Despite being a fitness nut, her husband had been plagued by chronic sinus issues, which have disappeared since he started the program. Why might that be? Lectins are the cause of sinus issues, because excessive mucous production is the first line of defense to entrap the lectins we consume. Next time your nose runs after you eat spicy salsa, remember this. And Mom? Her diabetes, high cholesterol, and arthritis are gone, she’s off all of her medications, and she’s thirty pounds li ghter—just by helping her daughter change her diet. The issues faced by these three people might seem disparate, but they were all united by lectin sensitivity—and they all found success upon removing lectins from their diet. Getting to the Bottom of Gluten Sensitivity AS YOU NOW know, gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and often in oats, is just one form of lectin, and the one that has received the lion’s share of a ttention in recent years. Consumption of any or all four of these “healthy foods” can trigger celiac disease, a life- threatening gut condition. Other people display sen sitivity to gluten in an array of symptoms, including brain fog, joint pain, and inflammation. All gluten foods contain lectins, although not all lectin foods contain the particular plant proteins known as glutens. What’s perhaps worse is that almost all grains and pseudo-grains contain glutenlike lectins. And there are thousands of other lectins—unfortunately, the standard Americ an diet, aptly abbreviated to SAD, is bursting with them. Moreover, many other lectins are more detrimental t han gluten. So-called gluten-free products are actu ally full of lectins in the form of flours made from corn, oats, buckwheat, quinoa, and other grains and pseudo-gra ins, as well as soybeans and other legumes. That explains why so many people whom I see in my practice who have eli minated barley, rye, oats, and wheat (BROW) continue to hav e digestive and other health problems, including be ing overweight or underweight, particularly if they eat “ ‘gluten-free” (but not lectin-free) products. 12 In fact, weight gain is a frequent result of going (supposedly) glu ten-free. Another issue can arise from going gluten -free as well: we all typically have bacteria that eat gluten, but if you omit all gluten from your diet, the food su pply disappears, and the gluten-digesting bugs depart. Then if you a re exposed to gluten at a later date, as you almost certainly will be, gluten will create problems for you. 13 SUCCESS STORY The Gluten-Free Myth Clarence V. cured himself of type 2 diabetes with m y dietary changes.

Fortunately, they are now happy with their surprise addition to the family—an d with Clarence’s improved health. Grains and Weight Gain THINK GLUTEN AND your first association is likely to be wheat. Alth ough barley, rye, and sometimes oats also contain gluten, no grain is nearly as omnipresent i n the American diet as wheat. As I mentioned earlie r, the weight- promoting properties of wheat prompted us to choose wheat over other less “weighty” grains ten thousan d years ago. Although wheat may be our favorite grain, it i s not your friend, regardless of whether or not you have been diagnosed with celiac disease or nonceliac sensitiv ity to wheat. Wheat is addictive, acting like an opiate in your b rain. Like most people, you tolerate its ill effect s because you are addicted to it. In addition to its addictive proper ties, wheat presents another huge problem for us—it actively promotes weight gain. You will learn how this happe ns in chapter 5, but meanwhile, consider this: to f atten a steer or other animal for slaughter, the farmer feeds it grains (and soybeans and other legumes), along with low-dose antibiotics. Grains with a side of antibiotics have the same effect on humans, plumping us up and play ing a major role in accounting for our horrifying health statis tics. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 70.7 percent of American adults are overweight, and of those almost 38 percent are obese. 14 Twenty years ago, less than 20 percent were obese. Sadly, being overweight is the new norm al, and lectins play a large role in this obesity c risis. And remember, our wheat intake doesn’t just come fr om the grains we eat directly. Since we feed animal s that wind up on our dinner table both grains and beans and antibiotics, that toxic stew also winds up in us, creating the perfect storm. And the storm becomes even more dangerous wh en we overuse broad-spectrum antibiotics ourselves. The Most Dangerous but Avoidable Lectin in Wheat? I t’s Not Gluten GLUTEN HAS BEEN the bad boy in the nutrition world for the last fe w years, escalating the interest in low-carb diets advocated by Dr. Robert Atkins and Dr. Arthur Agatston (creator of the South Beach Diet). Dr. Wi lliam Davis, author of Wheat Belly, and Dr. David Perlmutter, author of Grain Brain, continue to eschew grains and have brought wheat addiction to the fore in their books, but both focused on the gluten in wheat. In actual ity, gluten is just a small piece of the puzzle. You’ve already met a stealth villain lurking in whe at: wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Just to be clear, WGA is not associated with gluten; rather, it is found in bran . This means that white bread contains gluten but n ot WGA, while whole wheat bread contains the double whammy! Wheat germ agglutinin is an especially small protei n compared with most other lectins, which are relat ively large. So even if the gut mucosal barrier has not been com promised, WGA can pass through the walls of the int estine more easily than other lectins can. But this is jus t one of many ill effects caused by consuming WGA. It also: 1. Behaves like insulin, disrupting normal endo crine function by pumping sugar into fat cells, whe re the sugar soon turns to fat, resulting in weight gain a nd the development of insulin resistance. 2. Blocks sugar from getting into muscle cells, creating still more body fat, and starving muscles of nourishment. 3. Interferes with the digestion of protein. 4. Promotes inflammation by releasing free radi cals, which can thin the mucosal lining of the gut. 5. Cross-reacts with other proteins, creating a ntibodies that can induce autoimmune responses. The se antibodies are distinct from those formed by a reac tion to gluten."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"6. Crosses the blood-brain barrier, taking with it other substances to which it has bonded, and ca using neurological problems. 7. Kills cells, without distinguishing between normal and cancerous cells. 8. Interferes with the replication of DNA. 9. Causes atherosclerosis, the hardening of art eries from a buildup of plaque (which is never ment ioned in conventional medicine). 10. Enables entry of influenza and other disease- causing viruses into the body from the gut by bondi ng to the sialic acid in the mucosal lining. 11. Contributes to the development of nephritis, or kidney inflammation. 15 So how do you avoid WGA? Simply steer clear of whol e-grain bread and other whole-grain products. The Whole Story on Whole Grains ALTHOUGH WHOLE GRAINS have been considered health foods only for the pas t few decades, it’s worth recalling that a few thousand years ago, once grind ing technology made it possible to remove the fibro us parts of wheat and other grains, the privileged classes opte d to eat “white” bread. They relegated whole grains such as brown rice and brown bread made with whole grains t o peasants. The goal was to refine grains so they w ere easier on the gut, as well as to make bread whiter. Of cou rse, the rich didn’t know it at the time, but whole grains are considerably higher in lectin content than grains t hat have been stripped of their fiber, which explai ns why they were easier on their tummies. Greeks and Romans eve n debated over which country had the whitest wheat. FYI, Egypt won that contest. Today, everyone “knows” that brown rice is healthie r than white rice, yet the four billion people who use rice as their staple grain in Asia have always stripped the hull off brown rice to make it white before they e at it. Stupid? No, very intelligent; the hull has the lectins and these cultures have been removing it for thousands of years. Although I once believed that any white grain was i nferior to any brown (whole) grain, I have since ch anged my stance. Traditionally, the Chinese, Japanese, and o ther Asian people have not been plagued with obesit y, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions that are so common in the United States. 16 I will go so far as to say that if you’re overweight, there’s a good chance that it’s because you’re a believer in the myth of “whole-gra in goodness.” Distressingly, the renaissance of whole-grain produ cts has reintroduced WGA and a host of other lectin s back into our diet. This current obsession with “whole-grain goodness” is totally counter to what our forebears had been t rying to do with grains, but it is not the first time this fad has surfaced. Back in 1894, Dr. John Kellogg, a phy sician and superintendent of a sanatorium, was unsuccessful in his efforts to get his patients to eat whole grain s. (He was obsessed with “regularity,” which he saw as the key to good health.) When his patients refused to eat them, he and his brother, Will Keith Kellogg, came up with a way to disguise whole grains, in this case corn, in wh at became Kellogg’s cornflakes. And so started a change in wh at constituted a “healthy” breakfast, namely cold c ereal, and the genesis of a billion-dollar industry. That industry soon moved on to wheat as the “perfect” breakfast cereal, reintroducing WGA and a host of other lectins into our diet. Just so you realize how recent a phenomen on cold cereal is in human diets, no European or Asian had ever eaten it until 1945 when American troops stati oned abroad introduced it after World War II. I have many patie nts who emigrated from Eastern Europe or the Middle East and had never eaten cereal until the 1960s or ’70s. But the wider interest in whole grains took root on ly in the last fifty years among hippies, food fadd ists, and some nutritionists. Now the whole-grain movement has gon e mainstream, with breakfast cereals, bread, and ot her baked goods touted as health foods and often marketed wit h seductive words such as “whole-grain goodness.” H owever, this trend has actually wrought damage on our colle ctive gut and opened the door to other health probl ems. The increased consumption of both whole-grain foods and processed foods translates into a double whammy of lectin"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"increased consumption of both whole-grain foods and processed foods translates into a double whammy of lectin exposure. You may have heard of the French paradox, which ref ers to the fact that the French are able to eat bag uettes (made with white flour), drink red wine, and enjoy butter without gaining weight or suffering the ill health effects, specifically heart disease, that plague Americans. In her book French Women Don’t Get Fat , published a decade ago, author Mireille Guiliano, who was born and rai sed in France and now lives in the United States, b rought the French paradox to our shores, revealing how she enj oyed all these supposedly unhealthy foods while mai ntaining her trim figure and good health for decades. And th e French paradox doesn’t apply just to the fairer s ex. Middle- aged French men experience roughly half the rate of heart disease that American men do and live an ave rage of two and a half years longer. 17 But the real reason that both French men and women are more likely to keep their shape and have fewer heart problems than Americans is tha t they are not consuming WGA. It’s also why Italian s eating their own version of white bread and only small por tions of pasta made with white flour—in Italy, past a is a first course, not the main dish Americans make of it—don’ t get fat, or at least not as fat as Americans. I t ravel extensively in Italy, studying their food and cultu re, and the sad news is that they too have been inf luenced by the American trend: whole wheat pasta is beginning to a ppear on menus in cities frequented by tourists. Skip Both Wheat and Glucosamine The lectin WGA has a particular affinity for attach ing to joint cartilage and stimulating our immune s ystem to attack our joints. Both the inflammation and result ing pain can be temporarily alleviated with an over -the- counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin (Bufferin, Anacin, or Ecotrin), ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Anapr ox, Naprelan, and Naprosyn), or ketoprofen (Orudis KT). Or a physician may prescribe an NSAID such as Celebrex, Zorvolex, Indocin, or Feldene, among others. All these drugs may provide short-term relief, but they have deleterious side effects on your gut (see “ Breaching the Gut Wall ”, “ A Clue Emerges ” and “ Who Let the Dogs Out? ” for a detailed discussion). Glucosamine occurs naturally in your body and is fo und in the fluid that surrounds and cushions joints , where it serves its role as one of the building blo cks of cartilage. Glucosamine binds to WGA, relievi ng or eliminating the inflammation and therefore the pain . Taking glucosamine sulfate in supplement form has a salutary effect for many, but not all people. The r eason it is effective is not because it magically r elieves joint pain, but because it binds WGA and other lectins in the gut, which are then eliminated before they can enter your body. To break the vicious circle of taking NS AIDs to reduce the side effects inflicted by WGA, s imply omit wheat and other lectin-containing foods from y our diet. You’ll be shocked and delighted to see wh at happens. Natural and Manipulated Lectins UNTIL THE 1950s most people followed organic gardening methods, fe rtilizing their crops with manure and using mulch to protect roots and the microbes in the soil from extreme cold. By the middle of the twentieth century, thanks to petrochemical fertilizers, a remnant of t he munitions manufacturing for World War II, and th e development of refrigerated railcars, heirloom prod uce began to give way to hybrid varieties developed by seed companies to satisfy the needs of commercial grower s. A major factor was the need to grow produce in S outhern California, Florida, and other warm parts of the co untry that could be shipped in a refrigerated truck or railcar for distribution across the country. Hybrid vegetables and fruit that could withstand the journey and arri ve in good shape meant that, regardless of whether you lived i n South Carolina or South Dakota, you could find ou t-of-season produce year-round. Hybrids that made the cut were deemed desirable and varieties that couldn’t meet t he shipping test fell out of favor."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"However, shippable hybrids haven’t had hundreds of years to develop the natural ability to deal with i nclement weather and insects and other plant predators, as w ell as to compete with weeds. Because these plants lacked such natural defenses, commercial farmers began to rely on heavy use of biocides (pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides). The next step in the process of making modern farming more efficient and profitable was g enetic modification. In bioengineered plants, lectins are artificially inserted. Scientists selectively add f oreign genes into a plant’s basic genome to command the plant to manufa cture specific lectins that enhance the plant’s abi lity to resist insects and other pests. This is one form of geneti cally modified organisms (GMO). Not only do the food staples we eat today contain f ar more lectins than did the vegetables and fruits our grandparents ate, they also are more likely to be G MOs. And remember, these fruits are picked unripe, leaving their lectin content intact. Finally, and let me emphasiz e this point: just because the produce you are eati ng is grown organically doesn’t mean that you were designed to eat that plant. Lectins are naturally concentrated in the leaves and seeds of all plants, regardless of whether the plant is grown organically or conventionally. This means that while you can avoid GMO foods, you cannot avoid lec tins. The solution then is controlling which ones ( and how much of them) you consume. Hormesis and the Lectin Paradox Without question, plants can mess with your body, b ut at the same time, they contain compounds that ca n be beneficial. Their toxic nature actually educates th e innate immune system (the nonspecific immune syst em passed down from mother to infant at birth) to assi st you in fighting off pathogens such as pneumonia and viruses. Other lectins are antimicrobial. One lecti n inhibits the growth of the HIV virus. Lectins in garlic, bitter melon, and other herbs possess healing prope rties. Researchers are currently investigating the potential of some lectins to treat cancers, because they bind to cell membranes. Nonetheless, if you are lectin sensitive, the fact that lectins initiate chronic inflammation likely offsets the benefit of any anticancer actio n. To understand the lectin paradox, that certain food s can be both good for you and bad for you, it help s to understand the concept of hormesis, which refers to the fact that compounds that are bad for us in qua ntity are often simultaneously good for us in moderation. This concept is often expressed as “the dose makes the poison.” Eating such foods educates and mildly stre sses the immune system and cells in general, and therefore increases the likelihood of a longer life span. In the case of lectins, a little bit of the toxin can be protective. For example, bitter plants warn you to eat just a little of them. In general, long-lived c ultures have a history of eating bitter greens and herbs. As I s aid in my first book: more bitter, more better! Hormesis is actually an argument for eating a varie d diet. We humans evolved as a traveling species. T here is evidence that our hunter-gatherer forebears ate abo ut 250 plant species on a rotating basis. Most huma ns don’t even eat a tenth of that number, which in my opinion is an excellent argument, which we will get to later, for why we need to take supplements. The Gluten Distraction LET ME RETURN to the particular lectin called gluten for a momen t. Like a guy whose car was hijacked by bank robbers and used to commit a crime, gluten is just a minor player, and not the primary culprit in the debate surrounding the healthfulness of eating grains. In fact, in countries that depend on gluten as a major source of protein, people do just fine. Seitan, for example, a dietary staple in Indonesia, contains no WGA, jus t gluten. For most people, going gluten-free is like throwing out the baby (the protein) with the bathwater (the glu ten). In fact, a lot of people who struggle to give up gluten actual ly continue to eat foods that are more problematic, thanks to the other lectins they contain.

These products also often include soy or other bean flour s, which of course also contain lectins. And again, sugar in on e form or another frequently appears high on the li st of ingredients. There is another reason that people may mistakenly think that the problems they have with bread and ot her baked goods stem from sensitivity to gluten. Since 1950, commercial bakers in the United States have replace d the rising agent of yeast with transglutaminase, which is also a binding agent. When I do eat bread in the United States, it makes me feel bloated, but I have no such reaction with white bread made with yeast when I am in Europ e. That’s because yeast ferments and destroys the lectins in wheat, taming their effects. And guess what? In Fra nce and Italy, where bread is produced by traditional yeast-rising techniques, almost all the bread is white, not who le wheat. It contains gluten, which has been digested by the yea st, but no WGA. Would it surprise you then to learn that sourdough bread, made by fermenting wheat with bact eria and yeast, consistently ranks as one of the sa fest and least injurious breads, in terms of blood sugar spi kes? The bacteria and yeast together “eat” the lect ins and a good deal of the sugars! And here’s the kicker: Most “gluten-free” baked pro ducts are also treated with transglutaminase to mak e them fluffier and more appealing. Transglutaminase is al so used to bind together ground meat and seafood (f ake crabmeat is one example), which is why it’s often r eferred to as meat glue. Unfortunately, transglutam inase can pass the blood-brain barrier and act as a neurotransmitt er disruptor, making it extremely harmful and often responsible for the condition known as gluten ataxia, which is similar to Parkinson’s. Nonetheless, transglutamina se is FDA approved and does not need to appear on product lab els. It is important to note that transglutaminase also sensitizes us to glutens even if we’re not gluten-s ensitive. Read that last sentence again. This means that if you as sume you are sensitive to gluten because you have c ertain symptoms after eating store-bought bread and other products made with wheat, you may instead actually be reacting to transglutaminase. Finally, when whole grains are used in processed fo ods, including bread and breakfast cereals, it is n ecessary to add dangerous preservatives such as butyl hydroxytoluen e (BHT) to block the oxidation of the polyunsaturat ed oils in those whole grains. I’ll get to BHT and its cousins soon, but for now, let’s just say that you might a s well be spiking your bread or cereal with estrogen. These oils resi de in the germ of the grain. Unlike a saturated fat such as coconut oil, polyunsaturated fats are always on the lookout for oxygen atoms with which to bond, and when they do, the fat can become rancid. Rancid bread or crackers taste, well, rancid. A few years ago, I was lecturing in F rance and had to catch a very early flight back to the United Sta tes. I asked if breakfast could be delivered to my room at about 4:00 a.m. The front desk manager assured me that th ey would be happy to provide breakfast at that hour but said they could not deliver any croissants, since those would not yet have been made. When I suggested that leftover croissants would be fine, he became apoplectic, ass uring me that they would never do that, as they wou ld be unfit to eat. Remember this story when you peruse the sell-by dat e of any commercial bread or cracker or snack produ ct. If the date isn’t the day it was manufactured, then the pr oduct for sure contains BHT or another similar dead ly preservative. There are many reasons you want to av oid BHT—among them the fact that it is a major endo crine disruptor, acting like estrogen. This is the last t hing in the world you want your kids to be consumin g, because estrogen prompts fat storage; it also promotes earl y puberty in girls and “boobs” on seven-year old bo ys. 18 And if you need further incentive to avoid this preservati ve, know that BHT is used in embalming fluid, among other commercial uses. I kid you not! Patient Patterns BEFORE I REALIZED that lectins are largely responsible for our poor health and excess pounds, I observed specific patterns in the health of my patients—and then in the benefits they derived from my diet prog ram. When I"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"specific patterns in the health of my patients—and then in the benefits they derived from my diet prog ram. When I shifted the focus of my medical practice to restora tive medicine (sometimes referred to as functional medicine), many of my first patients were overweight men with heart disease. In the most basic terms, “restorativ e medicine” refers to medical practices that enable the body to heal itself rather than just treat the symptoms of disease. Usually my overweight patients were dragged in to see me, k icking and screaming, by their slim wives. Each wom an wanted me to “fix” her husband. Changing habits is a team sport, so in addition to the various sophisticated blood tests and genetic markers I would draw from the husband, I us ually asked the spouse to have the tests taken as w ell as a new patient. I also took a complete medical history fro m them both. Much to my surprise, these thin, supposedly healthy women had a number of health issues in common with one another. A shocking number were hypothyroid, most d ue to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune diseas e supposedly of unknown cause. (Not so, as you’ll lea rn.) A great number of them also had arthritis, oft en with very tender nodules in their finger joints. To relieve t he pain, they typically took one or more of the NSA IDs, and most of them had also been using a stomach-acid reducer such as Prilosec, Prevacid, or Nexium for years. In addition, a huge number of them relied on antidepressants. Many would tell me, “If you were married to my husband, you’d be on them, too!” But that’s not all. Often, they were also taking one or more drugs for osteoporosis and had been told that they had IBD (irritable bowel disease). In fac t, my average (supposedly healthy) female patient w as on seven medications! This compilation of hypothyroidism, arthritis, acid reflux, osteoporosis, bowel issues, and depression (and the drugs they took to relieve them) formed a pattern in thes e slim women. I started looking for other things th ey had in common. What were they eating? If you guessed “heal thy” foods, you’re right! They dined on whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bagels with fat-free cream cheese, egg white omelets, and salads with dressing on the side . They avoided fats like the plague. And yet, most of them were on a statin drug like Lipitor or Crestor to r educe their cholesterol levels, as well as the fistful of drugs for ailments that they considered “normal.” It see med that the “healthier” they ate, the unhealthier they became. And what of their husbands? Almost to a man, they f ollowed a now familiar pattern: the use of medicati ons to reduce high blood pressure, acid reflux, and choles terol, to relieve arthritis and other forms of pain , and to induce sleep. The medicine cabinets in these households mu st have been a regular pharmacopoeia! When the results of these specialized tests came ba ck, certain markers of inflammation and immune cell activation also emerged with remarkable consistency: the immun e systems of my patients and their wives were in fu ll attack mode. But once I put them on a two-page food list I had modified from the one in my earlier book, Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution, and advised them to remove certain household and p ersonal grooming products from their homes, I consistently witnessed their body’s natural ability to heal itself. Word gets around. Soon women with similar health is sues were turning up at my office on their own, min us a portly husband. But this time, a significant number of the se women were either overweight or obese. Many told a similar story: that their often vague complaints would be t ossed aside by their doctors as “female issues”: ho rmone disorders, depression, or anxiety. Most of them had tried every diet under the sun, having gone to Wei ght Watchers, Lindora, Medifast, etc. Many had made a genuine com mitment to exercise programs and yet here they were : fat and miserable. They carried with them the same cluster of prescriptions as my skinny women. They came beca use they knew something was wrong and their friends had said that I could “fix” them. And sure enough, the same dietary prescription that I gave my other patients fixed th ese folks as well. Then other patients appeared with autoimmune diseas es, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multip le sclerosis, and immune-system diseases, such as lymphomas or mu ltiple myelomas, Crohn’s, and ulcerative colitis. I soon became known as the Fixer. Next, stage 3 and 4 canc er patients arrived. You’ll be shocked to hear this , but not only did these autoimmune and cancer patients match simi lar patterns, most got better by following my food list. Lectin Detection FROM THERE, HOW did I specifically identify lectins as a primary c ause for so many patterns of health"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FROM THERE, HOW did I specifically identify lectins as a primary c ause for so many patterns of health problems in my patients? Good question. It actually happened in a roundabout way. In my thirty-plus ye ars of practicing medicine, I have come to the conclusion that the problems we have with our health are actua lly caused by very small things. This is particularly true of big health problems. Once more with feeling: Very smal l things (like lectins) can cause huge health problems. And it was a simple observation by one of the earliest adopte rs of my original dietary program that started me down a pat h that resulted in this book. The tests I order on all my patients reveal many pa tterns that have helped me understand what is happe ning to our collective health, but it wasn’t until I worked wit h a patient by the name of Tony that I experienced my eureka moment. Tony was a strikingly fit, energetic, mostl y vegetarian—he called himself a flexitarian—man in his early forties who had fully adopted my principles. As a r esult, he was eating lots of greens, and banishing grains and pseudo-grains, potatoes and other starches, as well as beans and other legumes. He had also dramatical ly cut back on fruit and seeded vegetables (which as you now kn ow are botanically fruits). Tony had also upped his intake of fish, shellfish, fish oil, olive oil, avocados, and macadamia nuts. Like all of my patients, Tony experienced improved vitality and athletic performance shortly after sta rting the program, and he lost ten pounds. But Tony suffered from vitiligo, a skin condition in which pigmentati on is lost. (That’s why Michael Jackson, who suffered from the same problem, became paler and paler over the years .) Vitiligo is caused by the gradual destruction of th e pigment-producing cells of our skin called melano cytes, which are modified nerve cells that migrate to our skin i n the embryonic stage of development. Why these ner ve cells die in people with vitiligo was unknown at the time, bu t an autoimmune process was suspected. The term “autoimmune process” is a catchphrase used to describe how the body’s immune system gets conf used and begins attacking its own cells. Patients with a utoimmune disease are told that their immune system is making a mistake. In Tony’s case, his melanocytes were being treated as if they were foreign invaders and had t o be killed, leaving him with patches of unpigmented skin. And, to be sure, his immune system was doing a good job of killing the cells it had misidentified. Now, I’ve seen just about everything in my years as a physician, and I like to think of myself as pret ty unflappable —but I was shocked to see and hear what happened wh en Tony started on my diet. Within weeks, he saw th e pigment return to his skin. That’s right: His vitil igo vanished—or more properly reversed itself—and h is skin pigmentation returned to normal. How did that happe n? Frankly, I didn’t know at the time. I did know t hat my dietary protocol was highly anti-inflammatory, but that didn’t explain the resolution of Tony’s vitili go. Thousands of years ago, Hippocrates, the father of modern med icine, had described the body’s ability to heal its elf, which he called veriditas (green life force). He believed that the physician ’s job was to identify which forces were keeping the patient from healing himself and then remove th em. Veriditas would take it from there. Clearly, Tony’s new eating habits had removed the roadblocks to his bod y repairing itself. There was veriditas in action, right before my eyes! So back I went to the review of my research—specifi cally, my xenotransplantation research as a pioneer ing surgeon in the art of heart transplants. What was in my pro gram (or what wasn’t in his new diet) that made Ton y’s body stop attacking his melanocytes? Had he added something, or had he removed the external force that was preve nting his body’s natural process of self-healing? Based on my transplant knowledge, I picked door number 2, the removal of an external force. But what was the external force? A word of explanation is in order. Most people with various health problems believe that certain foods or supplements are anti-inflammatory, meaning that the y dampen inflammation. What I was looking for is th e actual cause of inflammation, which, if Hippocrates is right (a nd he is), would stop inflammation in its tracks. I n other words, it wasn’t that my diet was quelling the infl ammation in Tony’s body, which most healing diets p urport to do. It was, in fact, that my diet was removing the root causes of inflammation, and once those were remove d, his body was capable of healing itself without the need for any anti-inflammatory compounds. This seemingly sma ll discovery will change how you think about how your body functions. Clearly, inflammation was causing Tony’s problem, b ut where did the inflammation come from? Strange as it seems, what I discovered was that there was inflamm ation in his melanocytes because they look suspicio usly like"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"seems, what I discovered was that there was inflamm ation in his melanocytes because they look suspicio usly like lectins to the immune system. Tony’s immune system had been attacking his melanocytes because, through no fault of their own, they bore a striking resemblance to l ectins. And because my diet had purged lectins, the cause of the inflammation was removed. Over hundreds of millions of years, plants have evo lved a strategy of creating proteins (like lectins) that bear a striking resemblance to critical structures in thei r predators. When lectins get through the gut wall, they activate the immune system, which starts shooting without first asking questions—and that means it may shoot both a t the lectins and also at the critical structures that re semble the lectins. Don’t forget that one of the or iginal purposes of lectins is to prompt an immune response on the nerv es of an insect to paralyze it. In this instance, T ony’s melanocytes—remember, they are modified nerve cells —were being misidentified as foreign. It was a case of mistaken identity, or what scientists call molecula r mimicry—and it led to my eureka moment. Once Tony eliminated lectins, normalcy returned. I now knew l ectins were causing this problem. But how did they get into Tony’s body from his gut in the first place? Pattern Matching PATTERN MATCHING , a term borrowed from the computer science field, refers to the act of checking a sequence of items to find the constituents of a pat tern. It happens every time you search for informat ion on the internet using Google, Bing, or Ask. As you enter e ach keystroke, the search engine pattern matches an d offers up what you appear to be looking for. The more informa tion you type in, hopefully the better the match. B ut, as you know, the search program often mismatches, sometime s in frustrating or humorous ways. For example, per haps you are planning a wedding and start to enter the words “white flowers,” but the search engine jumps the g un and offers up content on white flour. That wasn’t quite what y ou had in mind! You will recall that I had found strikingly common patterns in all my female patients’ medical complai nts, as well as in their eating habits. And many of the findings that I presented in Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution came from observing patterns in blood tests, particularly for triglyceride and cholesterol levels, that matched people’s food choices. These patterns were predictable each and e very time, and in every person. This observation is so important that I am repeating it here (and you will understan d the full implication when you get to Part II). Th e patterns followed simple time-of-year food availability and predicted whether the body was in a “store fat for the upcoming winter during the summer” mode or “burn fat to surv ive the winter” mode. The choices of food, even the sweetness of food, communicated with our cells, via pattern m atching, about which season it was, and we responde d accordingly, either by gaining weight (summer) or b urning calories in the form of fat for energy (wint er). Pattern matching is the secret to how every living organism —no matter how small or large—operates. And by usin g those sophisticated blood tests, I came to realize that p attern matching and my ability to measure their eff ects on my patients underlie most positive or negative health states. Immune System Scanners on Patrol WE’VE COME TO know only in the last few years that your immune s ystem uses quite simple scanning systems that look for and match patterns. I mentioned these systems in chapter 1 when discussing the second of the three strategies lectins use to fool your immune system. As a reminder, these scanners are known as TLRs; th at stands for toll-like receptors, but I like to think of them as tiny little radars. They are found in all cell mem branes of your body (and that of every animal). Every protein, whether it is a virus, lectin, or ce ll wall, possesses a unique bar code. The TLRs in y our body and on your white blood cells of your immune system behave like a Star Wars early warning system, looking for patterns that indicate foreign invaders, mainly bacteria and viruses. The TLRs constantly scan and “read” the m olecular “fingerprints” or bar codes of whatever protein ent ers your body, just as a scanner at the checkout co unter reads and interprets the UPC bar code on each product you pur chase, identifying it and determining its price. On ce the TLRs"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"interprets the UPC bar code on each product you pur chase, identifying it and determining its price. On ce the TLRs ascertain whether a particular bar code represents friend or foe, they decide how to respond, either b y letting the protein pass without a challenge or by turning on a larms and air raid sirens to alert your body and im mune system that an invasion is under way. Now envision another set of receptors, which act li ke a USB port on a computer, that literally scan in coming hormones, enzymes, and cytokines for instructions a bout what those hormones and enzymes want the cell to do. This second set of receptors, known as G-protein co upled receptors—let’s call them G-spotters—serve as docking ports on all cells, similar to those on the space s tation. When an incoming shuttle wants to unload it s cargo and information, its docking mechanism must fit the mec hanism on the space station, just as you can only u se a charger with a compatible plug to recharge your iPhone 7. L ikewise, only if a hormone or enzyme fits into the receptor can information be exchanged. If this communication system within your body sound s fantastical, consider that we take for granted th at our cell phones operate using invisible electrical pulses em anating from satellites or cell phone towers. Our b odies’ cellular communication works in much the same way. In other words, your immune system’s job is to scan for friend or foe patterns, and to sound the alarm whenever it encounters recognized patterns of foreign proteins. It then shares the knowledge of the foreign protei n patterns with the rest of the body, so that troops can be more ea sily rallied against the enemy in the future. This is what happens when you get a flu shot. A protein from the outside surface of the flu virus is injected into your arm . Your immune system sees this protein, reads its bar code as for eign, attacks it—and then it makes scanners on whit e blood cells and immune-signaling proteins that will be permanen tly on the lookout for the flu protein bar code. If the real flu virus gets in your system, wham, your body is ready . The TLR scanners—remember them as tiny little rad ars— recognize the incoming missile as a foe, they send out messages to alert the body, the missile defense system is launched, and white blood cells attack the foreign protein like a smart bomb. Result: no more flu viru s. Victory! The Search for Patterns THE DESCRIPTION OF these scanners won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2011. A year later the discovery of the receptors (G-spotters) was awarded the Nobel Pr ize for Chemistry. Together, these discoveries allo wed me to connect the final dots between patients who had wha t initially appeared to be completely unrelated pro blems. As I discovered, the cause of all my patients’ prob lems was that their cells’ TLRs and G-spotters were scanning for patterns, detecting patterns, turning on alarms, or activating cellular machinery. That’s because thei r TLRs and G- spotters were receiving information from input sour ces that never existed fifty years ago, thanks to a fundamental alteration in the foods people eat and the drugs an d personal care products they (and you) use. In sho rt, you have been hacked. And as a consequence, this process had devastated the health of my patients—and is almost certainly responsible for your health problems as well. How can I know for sure that this is what is happen ing, and that the constant scanning is largely resp onsible for an array of health problems? After all, these lethal e vents are unfolding within you at the cellular, mol ecular level without your knowledge. The compounds that trigger these receptors are so small, so invisible, that th ey seem insignificant. But thanks to the inflammatory hormo ne measurements and tests that I use, I’ve been abl e to track them for the last few years. The information I have gained from working with my patients has helped me find patterns in the immune system and the inflammation it generates that until now ha ve been hidden from view. And what I’ve found is th at lectins, and perhaps other foreign proteins, play a big role in disrupting communication between cells. Because lectins are master pattern mimickers, much of the information t hey communicate to cells is inaccurate. And the cau se of all of my patients’ problems is that their TLRs were inapp ropriately turning on alarms or that their receptor s were receiving inappropriate information. Regardless of my individual patients’ health issues, the common d enominator was a disruption in messaging. The patterns being d etected by their immune system had set off an immun ologic and hormonal firestorm within each and every one of the m, devastating their health. These conditions resol ved when"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"hormonal firestorm within each and every one of the m, devastating their health. These conditions resol ved when proper communication was restored. And the good new s? It’s all about making simple changes in your die t and lifestyle. A Deadly Case of Mistaken Identity WHEN YOU WERE a kid and got a sore throat, your mother probably worried that it was caused by a bacterium called beta-hemolytic streptococcus , known colloquially as strep throat. If you have k ids of your own, you have the same concerns. Strep throat can lead to rheumatic f ever, a very severe illness. But rheumatic heart di sease, which is what happens after surviving rheumatic fever, is wh at interests heart surgeons like myself. This condi tion used to be the primary reason for heart-valve replacement, bec ause survivors’ valves were almost always destroyed later in life. How valve destruction happens in rheumatic heart di sease is important to you, even if you’ve never had strep throat. The cell wall of the streptococcus bacteria is made of fats, sugars, and proteins and is identified by its characteristic bar code. If you’ve been infected with this particu lar strain of streptococcus, your immune system mak es scanners that patrol your bloodstream, ever on the hunt for the same bar code. Unfortunately, this bar code loo ks remarkably like the ones on your heart valve’s cell wall surfa ce. Imagine the streptococcus scanner’s surprise as it floats past your heart valves and comes across what it perceive s is a streptococcus bar code! The scanners send me ssages to attack and kill what it mistakenly identifies as st reptococcus. Then your immune system goes into full attack mode, day after day, year after year, silently and painle ssly attacking your heart valve. Finally, the valve is so damaged that it stops functioning, and I’m called in to rep lace it. As I remove that valve, I notice that the contents of the valve look a lot like the crud inside of the coronary arteries on which I do bypasses. That’s another clue to the puzzle: modern coronary artery disease looks just l ike the immune system attack that causes rheumatic heart di sease. I’ll tell you what causes that immune attack on your coronary arteries a bit later, but be prepared. Sca nner confusion in response to apparently similar ba r codes results in unwarranted attacks, and it is the underlying ca use of most of our current diseases and health issu es. Dangerous Impostors EACH PROTEIN HAS a unique bar code, but as you just saw with strept ococcus bacteria, many bar codes are remarkably similar. And some lectins are specifical ly designed by the plant to resemble compounds that are considered harmful by the body—such as lipopolysacc harides (LPSs), which are molecules that make up th e cell walls of certain bacteria in our microbiome. I’m no t one for swearing, but I can’t resist calling them “little pieces of shit,” because that’s exactly what they are! LPSs a re fragments of bacteria that are constantly being produced as bacteria divide and die in your gut. They travel th rough your gut wall and out into the body by riding on and hiding in saturated fats. Your immune system cannot tell the difference betwe en a whole bacterium and a fragment of one, so it t reats LPSs as a threat, just as though a true bacterial infect ion was present in your blood or elsewhere in your body. Your immune system then summons your white blood cells—I think of them as fighter jets and troops—into the attack, causing inflammation. But the extra bad news is tha t our immune cells, which are ever on patrol for th ese foreign bodies, can mistake the pattern of lectins for the pattern of LPSs and attack them, as though bacteria were loose in your system—further inflaming your body as a result . But the most dangerous trick pulled by lectins, whi ch I now see on a daily basis in my patients, is th at they bear an uncanny similarity to the proteins on many of our i mportant organs, nerves, and joints. Now, in an abu ndance of caution, your immune system doesn’t want to make a mistake in defending your body by not attacking som ething important. In the days before antibiotics, you woul d have been in big trouble if bacteria were present in your body, which is why your immune system is hypersensitive t o anything that even remotely resembles a bacterial cell wall or other foreign protein."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"My colleagues in rheumatology call this response au toimmune disease, but it is actually “friendly fire .” If an animal eats something containing lectins and gets sick, do esn’t feel well, or doesn’t thrive, it rapidly figu res out that eating that particular plant seed or product isn’t a good idea. Remember, a weakened enemy is the best kind o f enemy from a plant’s standpoint. And if you can get your enemy to shoot himself in the foot, you’re ahead of the game. When a plant predator (including a human) attacks i tself with an immune reaction, it becomes less like ly to eat the plant (and therefore its “babies”). Equally as impo rtant, it is less likely to reproduce and create mo re plant predators, again helping ensure the survival of the plant spec ies. SUCCESS STORY A God Learned How to Cure Himself My good friend Tony Robbins called me about five ye ars ago, looking for help. An eminent guru, a holy man considered a “god” to twelve million people around the world, was in a hospital in India, awaiting an urgent five-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting for sev ere coronary artery disease. Could I intervene and help him avoid surgery? My answer was a resounding yes! It’s not every day that I meet a god. The sixty-two-year-old guru’s blood work did not lo ok promising. Not only did he have severe coronary artery blockages, he was also terribly diabetic, wi th HbA1Cs—a marker of sugar and protein intolerance —of greater than 9.0 (normal is less than 5.6), and adv anced kidney failure. When he consulted me via Skyp e, I asked him if he was indeed a god, and he replied th at people call him a god because he performs miracl es and cures people. I responded by asking, why he doesn’t just cure himself, if he performs miracles. His re ply? “You know how this god thing works; I can cure anyo ne else, but I can’t cure myself! That’s what I nee d you for.” We hit it off immediately. The guru was being treated by an ayurvedic physicia n, and he ate a traditional Indian diet heavy on ri ce, legumes, and naan, a kind of flatbread. He had a cl assic “Delhi belly,” aka a beer belly. When I made it clear that the foods of his faith were the cause of his d iabetes, heart disease, and kidney failure, he was shocked. These were the foods recommended by all the gods be fore him. How could they be so unhealthy? My reply was the same as it is to anyone else who eats “heal thy”: How’s all that healthy eating working out for you if you have all these diseases? As Einstein was fond of saying, the definition of i nsanity is doing the same thing over and over and e xpecting a different result. I put the god on the Plant Para dox Program, and within a few weeks his chest pain was gone and his blood sugar level started to decline. Things were going well for about three months, unti l his blood tests results were suddenly terrible again. W hen we next Skyped, I asked him what happened. Apparently, every three months there is a festival to worship him and all the monks, and his followers shower him with foods for the gods, which he is obliged to eat. This pattern repeated itself for about two ye ars; two steps forward, one step back every three months whe n another festival occurred. Finally, on a Skype call a few years in, I couldn’t take it anymore. “Aren’t you god to your followers ?” I asked. “Yes,” he replied. “Well, doesn’t god make t he rules about what god likes to eat and what pleas es him?” I asked. “I never thought about it like that, ” he said. “I will tell my monks and my followers t hat we must all eat Gundry style to please me.” And that’s just what he did. Today, the guru’s skin has a radiant glow of health . His stress tests on his heart are normal, and his kidney failure is history, as is his diabetes. Without med ications, his HbA1C is an acceptable 5.5 and going down. Oh, and one more thing: His ayurvedic doctor now al so eats Gundry style! Each one of us has the power, the green life force energy, to heal from within once the external force s that prevent that natural ability are removed.

I know what you’re thinking: I’ve cited just about every illness and health complaint out there! How can one thing cause them all? Believe me, twelve ye ars ago I myself would have tossed this book out th e window if you had suggested that everything on this list was caused by consuming lectins, in collaboration with chemical and other disruptors that have infiltrated our bodies. However, my experience with tens of thousands of pa tients is proof that this is in fact the case—and that following my protocol will heal what ails you. What Has Changed? IF WE’VE KNOWN about lectins for more than a century and we eat l ectins daily in a huge variety of foods— you’ll find a complete list on “ The Just Say “No” List ”—why isn’t everybody being attacked by lectins? We ll, maybe they are. Or, if they weren’t attacking us in the past, why are they attacking us now? And what has changed? I have uncovered how lectins are infiltrating our b odies, and we’ll look at those disturbing factors i n the next two chapters."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"3 Your Gut Under Attack You’ve absorbed some complex and surprising concept s in the last two chapters—and there’s more to come , so consider this fair warning. Amazing as it may sound , everything I am about to tell you is backed up by peer- reviewed published research by scientists from pres tigious universities around the world, as well my o wn research at my Center for Restorative Medicine. Let me also remind you that the problems you have with your hea lth (and perhaps your weight) are actually caused by very, v ery small things. You’ll understand what I mean by that as we begin to explore the fascinating world that is your gut. You and Your Holobiome: Best Friends Forever WITHIN YOUR INTESTINAL tract and mouth and on your skin—and even in a clo ud around you—live hundreds of trillions of different minute microbes: bacteria plus a good number of viruses, molds, fun gi, protozoa, and even worms. One of our biggest health misconcep tions comes from our collective lack of awareness o f who we really are. The real you—or the whole you—is actually what you think of as “you,” plus t hose multitudinous microbes. In fact, 90 percent of all the cells that constitute you are nonhuman. To go a step further, 99 percent of all the genes in you are nonhuman. At first glance, the multiple life-forms with which we coexist may seem like an alternate reality. Yet you and your microbes are literally in this life together. Your health is dependent on them—as theirs is on you. At the most basic level, you are not alone. Most of us think that we are totally in charge of the decisions we make and the things we do. Your microbes—or “bugs,” as I fondly call them— would vigorously disagree. You may recoil at the th ought that minute nonhuman organisms or even simple nonli ving molecules exert so much power over you. Yet, w e know that this is true. You can think of it this way: you and your bugs can be seen as a country composed of trillions of inha bitants, human and nonhuman cells alike. The nonhuman cells are the legal aliens performing work for the countr y as a whole in a guest worker program. These aliens are h oused on their side of the tracks: on our skin and in our intestinal tract (and even in specific “work zones” within the intestinal tract). This multiplicity of microbes has collectively been called the microbiome, although scientists are now using the term “holobiome” as more descriptive; holobiome inc ludes not just the microbes in your gut, but also t hose on your skin and even in the cloud of bacteria surrounding each of us (much like Pig Pen in the Peanuts cartoo ns). Whichever term you prefer, you provide a home for t hese microbes, and they provide services in return. Yes, they rely on you to feed and house them, but what is ini tially harder for most of us to accept is that we a re equally dependent on them. Without our microbes, we could n ot live and function. We know this from experiments with germ-free mice, studies that initiated the research on the interaction between a host organism and its microbes. Germ-free mice, which are raised without a microbio me, are shorter and smaller, live shorter lives, an d are more susceptible to disease because their immune system never develops properly. 1 As a result, we know how vital it is that you keep your holobiome well fed and happy. I can’t resist sharing a quick story: I entered the state science fair as a fifth grader in 1960, and based on the research from the time into what is now called the holobiome , my project was to build a germ-free-mouse environ ment. Little did I know that decades later I would be wri ting about the synergy between human hosts and micr obes. As I’ve said, this isn’t my first rodeo."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Hard at Work in Your GI Tract NOW LET’S TAKE a closer look at what is going on in your gastroin testinal (GI) tract. For many of the “guest workers,” your gut is where they reside and do thei r job, breaking down and digesting plant cell walls and extracting energy and shipping it in the form of fats to you. Like all other animals, we are totally dependent on these microbe workers to do this crucial job. Even a termite cann ot “eat” wood; bacteria in its tiny gut actually do the work to digest the wood and convert it into energy. If they weren’t there, the termite would starve. One of the workers’ two main jobs is to extract ene rgy from plants that are eaten by their host. The o ther is to act as a sentinel for the host’s immune system. Because th ere is so much genetic material in the holobiome, s ome scientists believe, as do I, that we have “outsourc ed” much of our immune surveillance, almost like pu tting our genetic material in the cloud. The prevailing theor y is that we have outsourced the initial jobs of de tecting friends or foes and of deflecting foes to our holobiome. Where these guest workers reside varies by species, but there are generally three sites for animals to house their workers and break down plant material: for cows and other ruminants, it is the stomach or multiple sto machs; for gorillas and other great apes, it is the small inte stine; for humans, it is the large intestine (colon ). To understand where we are going, let’s pause for a short anatomy lesson. Your GI tract, which extends from your mouth all the way down to your anus, is actually yo ur skin turned inside out. The inside contents of y our intestines are actually outside of you. That’s right, the cont ents of your intestines are every bit as much a par t of the outside world as the world that you see around you. Whoa! H ow can that be? If it’s inside of you, how can it b e outside? Think of a highway tunnel under a river. Cars enter ing the tunnel are outside the river when they go i nto the tunnel as well as when they come out. As they pass through the tunnel, they’re not in the river, are they? Of course not. They’re still outside the river, but they happen to be inside a passageway that contains air rather th an water. Even though they appear to disappear into the river and emerge from the other side of it, they never were a ctually “in” the river. So, too, most of the food you swallow, along with your guest workers, appears to be inside you but is actually outside of you, even though it passes through you. Your intestinal wall serves as a border fence to separate the guest workers from the rest of you. Meanwhile, your skin is the home to trillions of sk in flora (microbes), and it has two primary functio ns: first, to protect you from the outside world; and second, to absorb and get rid of materials. The first of these jobs is the more important (or so we thought). The lining of your intestines is your skin turned i nside out and has the same two jobs as what you thi nk of as your skin. However, in this case, the more important job is to absorb materials in the form of food. As a r eminder, coiled within your belly, your intestinal surface has the same surface area as a tennis court! But here’s the problem. As you now know, the wall that lines your intestines is on ly one cell thick. These cells are bonded together by tight junctions, which are supposed to prevent anything “ foreign” from breaching the border into your body’s tissues and bloodstream. The objective is to keep the contents of your intestine, including your holobiome, where they belong, outside of you. If they get inside of you, all hell breaks loose. Strange but True: A Gift from Mom You inherited your initial collection of bugs from your mother. By design, when you exited the birth c anal, you were inoculated with her set of microbes to con stitute your initial holobiome. This collection of bugs was essential to educate your newborn immune system and its cells, a process that actually starts well bef ore birth. Lactobacilli , the type of bugs that thrive on milk sugar (lacto se), don’t normally live in your mother’s vagina, but during the last three months of pregnan cy, they migrate there. Would it surprise you to he ar, then, that a mother’s breast milk contains complex sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) that her infant cannot digest, but that are necessary for the health and growth of her infant’s bugs? And did you know that without a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"but that are necessary for the health and growth of her infant’s bugs? And did you know that without a normal set of microbes from your mother, your immun e system couldn’t develop properly? In fact, if you were born by cesarean section, it takes fully six m onths to build a normal set of microbes and a funct ioning immune system—just because you didn’t journey down Mom’s birth canal! Everything in Its Place FIVE POUNDS OF organisms—those bacteria, worms, protozoa, fungi, molds, and viruses, collectively known as your holobiome—live in your intestine, your skin, a nd the air around you and they help make up the who le that is you. Researchers have identified well over ten thou sand different organisms found in the holobiome to date, and the number climbs every year, as the Human Microbiome P roject expands. Why are those five pounds of microbes associated wi th you? Well, your holobiome plays a major role in your immune system, nervous system, and hormonal system— the whole enchilada of you—and communicates to huma n cells how things are going in the “outside” world. The microbes in your GI tract are there to digest t hings you cannot digest and pass that digested food into you, but they are also there to do battle with things y ou swallow that are meant to do you harm—including the plant protei ns called lectins. How the Gut Wall Should Work EVEN THOUGH THESE nonhuman cells that make up your holobiome are ess ential to your health and well- being, your human cells think these “other” cells b elong outside of you. It’s fine to receive messages and nutrients from your microbes, as long as they stay on their s ide of the fence. As the poet Robert Frost famously wrote in “Mending Walls,” “Good fences make good neighbors.” Your bugs are your close neighbors, but they need to stay on their side of the fence, meaning outside your sk in and the lining of your gut. Let me use the example of a nuclear power plant to help you understand how crucial this “fence” is bet ween your microbes and the rest of your body. Controlled nucl ear fission is an important yet extremely dangerous source of power. Uncontained, it represents the atomic bomb, but compartmentalized and controlled, it can power electrical generators and produce nonpolluting electrical ener gy. Supposedly impenetrable containment structures keep the radiation in check, but the danger is so great that all personnel wear radiation detectors, which serv e as scanners. Other scanners are positioned around and outside th e main reactors. If radiation is detected, the alar ms sound, signaling an imminent threat to health. And as the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear plant tragic ally illustrates, the escape of this toxic nuclear mater ial will damage the area surrounding the plant, per haps permanently. Though obviously on a much smaller scale, think abo ut how most of your microbes are housed in your GI tract. Those contents should be contained by the intestina l lining, which acts like the containment vessel of a nuclear reactor, to protect you from contamination. Your gu t bugs are akin to the nuclear energy. As long as t hey know their place and remain confined in the “outside wor ld” of your gut, these organisms are essential for you to function. But in reality, your intestinal wall is being breac hed on a daily basis—causing numerous and serious i ssues throughout the rest of your body. 2 Is it any wonder that many days you feel like you’r e suffering a “meltdown”? Keeping intestinal microbes in their place is diffi cult because the intestinal barrier has two somewha t contradictory jobs. Not only must the cells that line your intest ines keep lectins out, they must simultaneously let nutrients in. That’s a daunting task. Again, you have only a sing le layer of locked-together mucosal cells (called e nterocytes) in charge of preventing unwanted inhabitants of the GI tunnel from escaping and getting into you. SUCCESS STORY The Typical Vegan Diet Doesn’t Cut It"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"An eighty-year-old cookbook writer specialized in v egan cookery, meaning that her diet had a heavy rel iance on grains and beans. She had collaborated with Dr. John McDougall, who was one of the first proponents of an all-plant diet. When I met the writer, she was e xtremely thin and had severe arthritis in her hands . Tests revealed that she also had severe lupus as well as celiac disease, classic manifestations of lectins b reaching the gut wall. I placed her on the Plant Paradox Pro gram, and the lupus and celiac markers quickly reso lved. Despite her newfound health, my patient decided to retry her old way of eating what she called a “norm al” vegan diet of grains and beans. The reaction was a tenfold increase in lupus markers, diminished kidne y function (lupus nephritis), and increased congestiv e heart failure. This time the writer saw the light and returned to my program, with the happy result that all her issues once again resolved. Please remember this story when we talk about reintroducing lectins in P art II. What Should (and Should Not) Pass Through the Gut W all ONLY TINY SINGLE molecules of digested food should pass through the intestinal wall. So how does the good stuff in that salad and bowl of soup you had for lu nch ultimately get through your intestinal wall? Si mply put, in order to cross the border checkpoint from your GI t ract into you, all food has to be broken down into individual amino acids (from protein), individual fatty acids (from fat), and individual sugar molecules (from su gars and starches). These small, single molecules provide en ergy (calories) and nutrients. Acids, enzymes, and yes, your microbial guest workers do all that work of digesti ng big molecules for you. Your mucosal cells then literally bite off a single molecule of amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar, p ass it through the body of the cell, and release it into your portal v eins or lymph system abutting the back of these cel ls. These tiny molecules go through the system without ever having to break through the “locked arms” of the tight ju nctions of mucosal cells. When all is working well, the big mo lecules remain outside where they belong because th ey are literally too big for the cells of the intestinal w all to “swallow” them. How come? First, your mucosa l cells can’t bite off more than they can chew. Second, if everyt hing is functioning properly, big molecules should not get through; if they do appear across the border, your immune system concludes that a foreign invader is l urking and sounds the alarm. Breaching the Gut Wall THIS IS A great system, except when it isn’t. As you might s uspect, things don’t always work the way they are supposed to. Thanks to changes in what we eat, how foods are grown, and other causes—like consuming ov er-the- counter painkillers, particularly nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—lectins and lipopolysa ccharides (LPSs) now breach the intestinal border on a daily basis. With the exception of WGA, lectins are big p roteins, and you now know that big proteins can’t normally get t hrough the intestinal wall without difficulty. But lectins are adept at prying apart the tight junctions between t he cells that make up your intestinal mucosal borde r. This breach also allows larger molecules to pass though into th e body, where they too wreak havoc. And when lectin s, LPSs (remember, I think of these cell walls of certain b acteria as little pieces of shit, which they litera lly are), or both escape from your gut and into your body, your immun e system perceives this as an attack, goes on high alert, and signals your body to store fat and supplies for the “war” effort. Simultaneously, lectins bind to and block the border crossings of each intestinal cell so that vitamins and other nutrients can’t be absorbed. If lectins cause all the problems listed here , why haven’t other health-care practitioners told you about this? My only answer is “You can’t see unless your eyes are open!” Most doctors and nutritionists are completel y unaware of lectins and their effects, which is why to them it would appear that most people are able to eat lecti ns, including gluten, and not experience any ill effects. The key word in that last sentence is “appear.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"SUCCESS STORY Cured of Crohn’s Disease I met Jill W. on Skype a couple of years ago. A twe nty-year-old college junior, she was on a full scho larship provided by the foundation one of my patients had s tarted to encourage students to go into careers tha t study immunology. My patient had suffered from Crohn’s di sease, a disabling autoimmune disease of the bowel, which is treated with transplant antirejection drug s. I put her on the Plant Paradox Program, and with in three months she was cured of Crohn’s, and as a side effe ct had lost fifty pounds. Needless to say, she was delighted with the turn of events, so she shared th e two-page Plant Paradox Program food list with Jil l, her scholarship student, who also suffered from Crohn’s . An eminent professor of gastroenterology at the M ayo Clinic was treating Jill at the time. My patient as ked if I would talk with her, and I said yes, of co urse. Jill began our conversation by telling me that when her sponsor had sent her the Plant Paradox list, s he was suspicious. She had been on every diet for Crohn’s without success. Moreover, her professor (and docto r) had assured her that Crohn’s was genetic—that was his a rea of research—and that diet had nothing to do wit h it. With a sheepish look on her face, she told me that to humor her sponsor, she began the Plant Paradox Program. Then her face lit up on the video monitor: “After two weeks, I had the first normal bowel movement of my life, and they have been normal ever since. But two days ago, I called my doctor at the Mayo Clinic with the exciting news that my Crohn’s was cured by the diet. He told me that it was a pla cebo effect, because diet has nothing to do with Crohn’s and that my ‘cure’ was all in my mind. “I was so upset,” she continued, “that I got off th e phone and went into the kitchen where my mother w as baking Christmas cookies. I ate two of them. A few minutes later, it was like a bomb went off in my st omach. That night, the cramps and diarrhea returned. I imm ediately went back on the Plant Paradox Program and all is well now. But, Dr. Gundry, why didn’t my doctor believe that it was the food all along that was cau sing my Crohn’s? How can he not see that?” I told her, as I’ll tell you again: Your doctor can ’t see unless his eyes are open! First of all, ther e’s no way to know that lectins are causing problems if you don’t even know what lectins are. Second, even an awaren ess of lectins doesn’t mean you understand the implicat ions of what they do. Read on to see how my eyes were opened. Soon your e yes will be as well. And I’ll also provide you with the tools to repair your gut lining and restore your health. Remember, much of what goes on in your body is unde tectable by conventional means. What if lectins are doing harm but it’s not obvious—or not immediately obvious? My patients’ blood work certainly suggested that damage was occu rring, suggesting that lectins or something that lo oked remarkably like them were getting through the locke d-arm mucosal barrier. But how could lectins sudden ly get through, after eons during which they couldn’t? Wha t had changed? A Clue Emerges I WAS PERPLEXED , to say the least. Then, about twelve years ago, I ran into the head of pathology in the hall of my hospital. He said, “Hey, you trained as a genera l surgeon before becoming a heart surgeon. What do you know about intestinal webs?” I told him that I had never heard of them. Neither had he, he replied, and pro ceeded to tell me about a woman in her fifties who had come in wit h intestinal obstruction and was immediately rushed into the operating room where a large part of her small inte stine, which was swollen and blocked in several are as, had to be removed. When the pathologist opened the bowel, he discovered “webs” of tissue, like washers on the fi tting of a garden hose, which almost completely blocked the en tire interior of the tube. Only pinhole openings re mained. The pathologist had never seen anything like it. Intrigued, I asked where the webs had come from. He didn’t know yet, but he researched it, and sure en ough, it’s actually quite common in people who regularly use N SAIDs, such as Advil and Motrin, both brands of ibu profen, or Aleve, Naprosyn, Mobic, Celebrex, and aspirin. A ll but aspirin were introduced in the early 1970s f or pain and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"or Aleve, Naprosyn, Mobic, Celebrex, and aspirin. A ll but aspirin were introduced in the early 1970s f or pain and fever relief and as an arthritis medication in lieu of aspirin. Prolonged use of aspirin was clearly a ssociated with damage to the stomach lining, but because other NSA IDs did not damage the stomach, drug companies hera lded them as nothing short of miraculous. My next question to my colleague was how these NSAI Ds cause intestinal webs to form. His reply was tha t he didn’t care, now that he knew what the webs were. B ut, being the curious type, I started investigating , and in doing so, I opened a Pandora’s box and have never looked back. In brief, NSAIDs do not damage the stomach li ning, which we can view with a gastroscope; instead, they damage the lining of the small intestine, which is beyond the reach of a scope. Because we could not see their il l effects, NSAIDs have done extreme damage to the b arrier that keeps not just lectins, but also LPSs, out of you. Who Let the Dogs Out? “FRIENDLY” BACTERIA, WHICH populate the innermost layer of cells in the gut ( the mucous layer, right next to the intestinal cell border), thrive on comp lex resistant starches called fructooligosaccharide s (FOS). These beneficial bacteria not only live in mucus, they al so stimulate mucosal cells to make more of this goo d stuff. Mucus then acts as a moat to trap lectins and block them from passing through the intestinal border. The mor e mucus you produce, the more resistant you are to lectins—unle ss you’re regularly taking NSAIDs. (Mucus isn’t con fined to your gut. It turns up as the snot in your nose, whe re it likewise traps foreign proteins and keeps the m out of your body. Yup, snot is good!) Copious research published over the last half centu ry reveals that gulping down apparently harmless NS AIDs is like swallowing a live grenade. These drugs blow gaping holes in the mucus-lined intestinal barrier. As a r esult, lectins, LPSs, and living bacteria are able to deluge the br eaks in your levee, flooding your body with foreign invaders. Inundated by these foreign proteins and other invad ers, your immune system does what it does best, pro ducing inflammation and pain. This pain in turn prompts yo u to down another NSAID, promoting a vicious cycle, which can ultimately result in your seeking out prescript ion-level pain relievers. In other words, that harm less Aleve or Advil is the pharmaceutical industry’s gateway drug , 3 as you will discover in the next chapter. A course of antibiotics, stomach-acid reducers, or even changes in our food supply also allow bad bacteria to move in and take over, just as NSAIDs do. Increased intestinal permeability from lectins and LPSs, as well as the regular use of NSAIDs and acid -reducing drugs, produces what is commonly called leaky gut s yndrome. Although, along with others, I originally thought that leaky gut was an isolated condition affecting a few unfortunate individuals, now I am convinced that l eaky gut underlies all our disease issues, just as Hippocrat es posited. Adding insult to injury, consuming the lectins in whole- grain products and other baked goods—including even gluten-free varieties made with the rising agent k nown as transglutaminase (see “ The Gluten Distraction ”)—independently makes the intestinal permeability worse. Remember that for centuries, the bran from these gr ains was discarded, making whole grains a relativel y recent addition to our diet—and a recent problem as a resu lt. The Real Cause of Autoimmune Diseases NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY . What I’m about to tell you will shatter your curr ent beliefs about conditions commonly called autoimmune diseases. If you suffer from Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, microscop ic colitis, hypothyroidism (or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’ s syndrome (dry eyes and mouth), scleroderma, systemic scleros is, psoriasis, Raynaud’s syndrome, dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis (that’s plain old arth ritis), or any other—that’s right, any autoimmune disease—the good news is that you can eliminate it without usin g drugs! I get to see it happen every day. And the answer lies in healing your leaky gut, which we will discuss in Pa rt II. Modern research has confirmed Hippocrates’s belief that all of these diseases begin in the gut and can be cured by"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Modern research has confirmed Hippocrates’s belief that all of these diseases begin in the gut and can be cured by healing the gut. Strictly from word-of-mouth recomm endations, 50 percent of my practice for the past t en years has involved the treatment and cure of autoimmune disea ses. And based on copious and rigorous measurements of laboratory and clinical markers of disease activity at my institute, I (along with others) am now conv inced that all autoimmune diseases are caused by alterations in th e good bugs and the bad bugs that live in your gut and your mouth and on your skin, along with a change in the permeability of your gut wall and mouth and gums. What impacts that permeability? As we learned above , NSAIDs, antibiotics, acid-blocking drugs such as Nexium and Prilosec, and the biocide Roundup all change yo ur gut flora and the mucous layer of your gut. This compromises the barrier wall of your intestines on a daily basis, thereby allowing lectins in. And thi s confluence of forces prompts your immune system to unleash an att ack on you, in a classic case of mistaken identity caused by molecular mimicry. As a reminder, molecular mimicry is caused by our immune cells attacking proteins o n cells or organs that resemble the patterns on lectins and LP Ss. The spectrum of deleterious effects from leaky gut initially occurs out of sight, but when the damage to your intestinal wall becomes so severe that you lose the absorptive part of your intestine, it makes its pr esence known by less protein showing up in blood tests. Much as a s ponge or chamois cloth can absorb liquids, under no rmal circumstances the intestine is capable of taking up large amounts of proteins, fats, and sugars—until it can’t. To understand just how insidious this is, think of how smoking cigarettes can silently destroy the oxygen -exchanging surface of the lungs long before a diagnosis of emp hysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CO PD) is made. Likewise, lectins can silently savage the abs orptive layer of your intestine. In both situations , by the time the damage is apparent, it is thought to be too late fo r repairs. In my practice, I often see skinny peopl e who cannot absorb nutrients no matter how much they eat. In fa ct, much of what we assume is a normal part of the aging process is actually the cumulative effect of lectin toxicity. But unlike COPD, this damage can be repa ired! When a city is bombed in wartime, the residents flee and t he city cannot be rebuilt until the bombing ceases and the people return. Think of lectins as incoming bombs. In orde r to repair the damage, you must stop eating lectin s—and I am going to show you how. A Symbiotic Relationship THE MAJOR ROLE your microbes play in essential jobs such as diges tion, elimination, and gut health is just the tip of the iceberg. Microbes are also the main defe nders of your health. They constitute a complex eco system and are in constant communication with your brain and t he rest of your body, sending and receiving message s. 4 Long before instant messaging became a way for us to com municate via our electronic devices, these microbes have been transmitting messages back and forth to control our hormones, our appetite, and our preferred foods, a mong other functions. You and your microbes coexist in what biologists ca ll a mutually symbiotic relationship. Your existenc e depends upon them and their existence depends upon you. The animal kingdom offers many examples of symbiosis. For example, a water bird known as a plover picks food off the teeth of a crocodile. The bird gets its din ner and the croc gets clean teeth, which enables it to keep hunting. Other birds, such as the oxpecker, or tickbird, ri de around on the backs of large African mammals, consuming the annoy ing insects that flock to them. As just one example of the symbiotic relationship with your holobiome, certain microbes on your skin will fight to the death to h eal a wound and protect you from other microbes that would harm you. The “good” microbes defend you because you an d they are in a symbiotic relationship. The deal is that y ou feed them and they protect you. As such, your gut buddies are invested in the care and upkeep of their home. They even communicate the ir happiness by making most of the feel-good hormones, such as serotonin, for you. (If you are taking an antidepressant, let me assure you that your gut bud dies have left the building!) However, if you alter this relationship, the roles can change. Drive off the g ood bugs or let the bad bugs in, and it’s as though gang members have taken over a pleasant neighborhood. They have no interest in the care and upkeep of you; they are only out for themselves. They also hijack the ancient communicat ion system between the normal gut denizens and your brain,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"themselves. They also hijack the ancient communicat ion system between the normal gut denizens and your brain, making you crave the foods that they need; namely sugars, fats, junk foods, and fast fo ods. This hijacking operation is just another reminder that it’s not your fault t hat you’re tired, sick, or overweight. This complex system normally enables the various in habitants and cells of your holobiome to communicat e and coexist. As strange as it may seem, these single-ce lled organisms are intelligent beings, which act ju st as you (or any other complex multicelled organism) do. Have th e right bugs within you, and give them what they wa nt, and not only does no one get hurt, but you and they als o thrive. But let the bad ones take over, and you g et taken over as a consequence. Although it is hard to believe, “the y” control most of you. And in just the last fifty years, numerous factors have changed dramatically, resulting in an untoward disruption of the normal communication sys tems within your body and its microbes. In the next chapter, I will introduce you to what I call the Seven Deadly Disruptors, which with your broken gut have conspired to allow lectins, LPSs, and other fo reign invaders into your gut. At the most basic lev el, that’s why you feel you aren’t in sync with yourself. The Brain-Gut Messaging Path The vagus nerve, also called the sympathetic nervou s system, is the largest nerve coming from the brai n to the gut. It communicates orders to all the various organs in your body. Recently, exciting studies hav e shown that lectins reach the brain not only through the b lood but, shockingly, also by climbing the vagus ne rve from the gut into the brain. 5 It turns out that for every fiber leading from the brain to your heart, lungs, and your abdominal organs, there are nine times as many fibe rs leading up to the brain from the gut. There are actually more neurons in your gut than in your entire spinal cord. You truly have a second brain within your gu t, and that brain is controlled by your holobiome. Unlike what I and most other doctors were taught in medica l school, the vagus nerve exists to get information t o the brain from the gut, not the other way around. I tell my patients that when they have a gut instinct, they a re absolutely right! A Shift in the Balance of Power AS LONG AS the good bugs are in the majority, you should be i n good shape, but when the bad guys dominate, problems prevail. Fostering the right mix of microb es is essential to restoring health and preventing disease. You must feed the good microbes what they need to thriv e, while simultaneously eliminating sugar and other foods on which bad microbes feast. Like any host, you must f eed your guests as well as yourself, and in this ca se, in order to nourish yourself, you must first nourish the good m icrobes. That seems simple enough, and it is why many well-m eaning health gurus ask you to take probiotics and eat fermented foods. But not so fast. Even good bugs ne ed to stay on their side of the intestinal border. If you have good bugs and you take an Advil or Aleve, or swallo w some acid blockers, or eat lectins that you aren’ t designed to interact with, your intestinal wall is breached, an d the nuclear meltdown occurs—despite having plenty of good bugs! Ultimately, though, due to changes in the food supp ly, over-the-counter and prescription drugs, and en vironmental factors that have occurred imperceptibly over the l ast half century, most of your ancestral personal m icrobes have been destroyed, enabling others to dominate. 6 Regardless of how aware you may have been of your h olobiome, the fact is that it has been disrupted. And the reason you, like so many other people, are not enjoying pe rfect health is that your relationship with your microbes (along wi th a number of environmental triggers) has changed. If you are overweight, likely the same forces are at work. Ins tead of working symbiotically with you, your microb es are incapable of providing valuable information—and wor se yet, they may convey false information, much as a virus can take over your computer, inserting new data tha t leaves your system vulnerable.

SUCCESS STORY From Ninety-Eight-Pound Weakling to Champion The parents of Michael V., an emaciated thirteen-ye ar-old, brought him to see me. Michael’s father was a wrestling coach, but his son was skin and bones and clearly needed help. They had heard that I could c ure Crohn’s disease, which he had suffered from thanks to having taken antibiotics much of his life to tre at a chronic tonsil infection. The immunosuppressant dru gs he was taking for the Crohn’s were not helping, and the diarrhea and bloody stools were clearly taking their toll. The boy was ready to try anything, including giving up the foods any teenager loves. We dove in and together we banished lectins from his diet and rebu ilt his gut wall with high-dose vitamin D 3 , prebiotics, and probiotics. Within three months, Michael’s bloody d iarrhea and cramps were gone, and he started gainin g weight—he even started training with his dad. Even though it was hard for the boy to stay on the program, whenever he cheated, he immediately felt i t in his gut, making it easier to stay on track. The pee r pressure was tough, but he kept telling me that f eeling well never tasted so good. With each visit, we tapered h is immunosuppressant cocktail until it was gone. By that point, he was in high school, and he had joined the wrestling team. Michael is now a vigorous, muscular, handsome young man. Last year, father and son came to my office. His dad was carrying the sports section of the local pa per. It featured a lead story about his son, who ha d nearly wasted away five years earlier—and was now a divisi on winner of the California State Wrestling Championship. He is now off to college with a sport s scholarship. Beating Back the Gut Busters IN THE NEXT chapter, you’ll learn how to identify and then avo id or eliminate the Seven Deadly Disruptors, which have opened the door to lectins and other gut busters. These disruptors are playing a major role in changing you and your gut microbes, and they have been contr olling you for some time now—feeding you and your holobiome information via the food you eat, the bev erages you drink, the personal care products you us e, the household cleaners you use, and even the containers that hold your food and beverages. All have altere d you (or your parents) and our microbes over the last fifty- something years. All are subtle, invisible, and und etectable. And all have allowed lectins through your gut wall, mak ing you the victim of ongoing autoimmune attacks an d hormonal disruptions. As we’ll soon see, proper diet and certain suppleme nts are key components of what will become your gut protection and repair strategy. And effective as this dietary approach is, it needs to be accompanied by certain lifestyle changes."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"4 Know Thy Enemy The Seven Deadly Disruptors There is an infamous experiment you’ve probably hea rd of. Drop a frog into a pot of very hot water, an d it will jump right out. But put it in a pot of lukewarm wat er and slowly raise the temperature, and it will bl issfully sit there until it boils to death. The difference in the two outcomes is simply because the change in temperatur e is so gradual that it is imperceptible to the frog’s temperature receptors, or pattern matchers. Like that frog, so subtle have the changes within y our body been that you, too, have barely noticed. A ll these big things that have profoundly altered you arise from very small things. Each negative alteration of your body impacts your health, which, in turn, means that you crave m ore unhealthy foods and/or need more drugs or medic al procedures. We have become dependent on many of the se products and procedures, which appear to improve our health and standard of living, but actually make us sicker and potentially hasten our death. Meanwhile , the most heavily funded health-care system in the world is c ollapsing from the resulting financial burden, aggr avated by the needs of an ever increasing number of patients. Living Longer but Not as Well THERE IS A misconception that our collective health has impro ved significantly in recent decades. (If that is indeed the case, then why are we so overweight as a nation?) Much of that idea is based on the fact th at the average life expectancy has increased over the last five de cades. In 1960, average life expectancy for America n men was 66.4 years; by 2013, it was a full ten years longer . 1 For women, the average ages were 73.1 and 81.1, res pectively. But you have to understand that this data is heavil y weighted by dramatic reductions in recent decades in the prevalence of infectious diseases, which disproport ionally impacted infants and children. This phenome non is the real reason life expectancy appears to have risen d ramatically over half a century. Vaccines now prote ct youngsters from killer epidemics of measles, German measles, m umps, diphtheria, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, who oping cough, influenza, and other infectious diseases. An tibiotics have saved millions more lives from condi tions that once often proved fatal. Infant mortality has also dropped significantly, thanks to improvements in pr enatal care and childbirth practices. In 1935, fifty-six of every t housand children did not survive their first year. By 2006, this number was down to fewer than six kids per thousand , 2 although black children are still far more likely t han white children to succumb to disease. Moreover, the Unite d States still lags behind twenty-five of the other richest countries in its infant mortality rate. 3 Life expectancy is a critical gauge of any society, of course, but equally important is what I call he alth expectancy. Even if we are living longer, are we living better? These days, for most people, a vast amount of thei r later life is spent in a state of progressive decline. Despite th e belief that “fifty is the new forty” and other su ch hopeful claims, we are collectively far less healthy than our paren ts were at a comparable age. A new study reveals th at from about fifty onward our health begins to decline, far earl ier than was previously assumed. 4 However, unless you are fortunate enough to be a “canary,” you are likely o utwardly unaware of this decline. We also take a lot more medications. When my patien ts first come to me, they are on an average of seve n different drugs. Is this any way to live? I have a better ide a: Die young—at a very old age. Or as Liping Zhao, a Chinese holobiome researcher, puts it, “Eat right. Stay fit . Live long. Die quick.” I believe that this is wha t most people want for themselves. How do we compare with the rest of the world’s popu lation?

Globally, the United States doesn’t fare ve ry well in the life expectancy department, ranking thirty-fift h. Japan, on the other hand, ranks second. But then things get interesting. Americans spend on average of $8300 pe r person annually on health care, but only $2200 fo r food. The Japanese spend $3300 and $3200 on health care and f ood, respectively. 5 What does that say about our priorities? Over the last half century, we have artificially bu t effectively propped up life span with a host of m edical procedures, drugs, and treatments. A person with de mentia might live for decades if s/he is well cared for, but is that living well? As a heart surgeon, I have done m y part to extend the lives of thousands of individu als, and the devices I’ve invented make heart surgery safer, so patients are more likely to survive an operation an d go on to live for years more. Meanwhile, the number of people liv ing with type 2 diabetes and other serious health p roblems has also increased geometrically. The period of senesce nce, of growing old, has extended significantly, wi th huge increases in health-care costs for older people. Ju st to be clear, I’m not advocating letting people d ie when medical intervention can prolong their lives; however, I am making a distinction between quality of life and y ears of life. By the way, to puncture another myth, there have al ways been people who were fortunate enough to avoid or survive the diseases that once killed so many child ren and adults and live well into their nineties. J ust visit a churchyard in one of the original thirteen colonies and you will see the evidence engraved on their gr avestones. Invisible but Insidious Damage MOST OF YOU will be surprised to learn that substances you use every day, eat every day, and drink every day— substances that you have been told are good for you —have been altered such that they can completely ch ange the way your cells communicate with not only other huma n cells, but also the organisms that make up the “o ther you.” And these changes have largely come about within th e last fifty years. Could it be that we’re just like that frog sitting in the pot of water? What if each of us is being at tacked every day, but the assault is virtually imperceptible—impercep tible, that is, until the water is boiling? Well, i f you have any of the conditions listed here , guess what? The water is already boiling. But who lit the fire? I have startling evidence that at least seven subtl e changes that have occurred in the last fifty or s o years have completely, and potentially irrevocably, altered yo ur health. We have been subjected to new patterns i n food and, even more recently, new ways of processing food, an d to new personal care products that mimic a whole different set of compounds. At the same time, environmental t oxins and electric lights have utterly changed our environment. Thanks to these disruptors, or rogue pattern matche rs, you really aren’t “yourself” anymore. You’ve al ready learned about two other disruptors: whole grains and transg lutaminase. As a reminder, whole grains directly in troduce lectins, particularly the protein wheat germ agglut inin (WGA) into your gut. They both initiate the in testinal leakage of LPSs into your bloodstream and incite hormone mi micry. And consuming transglutaminase sensitizes yo u to glutens even if you’re not gluten-sensitive. SUCCESS STORY The “Healthy” Hoax When she came to me, seventy-six-year-old Jennifer U. had rheumatoid arthritis and elevated inflammati on markers, which we abolished and returned to normal numbers by following the Plant Paradox Program. Thi s was all good news until Jennifer started eating Dav e’s Killer Bread. She assumed it was healthy becaus e it was made with a variety of whole grains and promise d to “rock your world.” (One loaf contains no less than twenty-one grains and seeds!) Almost immediately, a ll her inflammation and rheumatoid markers skyrocketed and she reexperienced the severe joint pain that had gone away. Not surprisingly, when I h ad her eliminate the well-named bread, all her markers ret urned to normal.

They feed you information via t he food you eat, the beverages you drink, the medic ations you take, and even the food containers and personal car e products you use. And that information transforms you unwittingly into a weight-gaining machine, no matte r what you do. DISRUPTOR 1: Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics Over the last fifty to sixty years, our culture has experienced a number of momentous changes in healt h and disease prevention, but medical improvements can be a doubl e-edged sword, akin to the plant paradox. Like plan ts, they keep you alive, but they can also kill you. A sterl ing example of such a medical advance is broad-spec trum antibiotics, which were initially considered miracl e drugs. Developed in the late 1960s and early 1970 s, broad- spectrum antibiotics are capable of killing multipl e strains of bacteria simultaneously. (Most antibio tics used these days are this type.) Indeed, they have saved and co ntinue to save countless lives from diseases such a s pneumonia and septicemia. However, these antibiotics effectiv ely allowed doctors to carpet-bomb an infection wit hout worrying about exactly which bacterium was the culp rit. We doctors were so impressed with these antibi otics that we used them, and sadly still do, even in situation s where our best guess is that a virus, which isn’t killed by antibiotics, is the culprit. Little did we know at the time that we were also ca rpet-bombing ourselves. How so? Every time you take a course of Levaquin, ciprofloxacin, or another broad-spectr um antibiotic for a urinary-tract or another infect ion, you kill most of the microbes in your gut. Shockingly, it ca n take up to two years for them to return. Many may be gone forever. Even worse, each time a child takes antibi otics, the likelihood increases of him or her devel oping Crohn’s disease, diabetes, obesity, or asthma later in life . 6 Today, there is a greater understanding of bacteria than there used to be. Many species we once regard ed as bad are now considered beneficial. Think of it this way: Yo ur holobiome is like a mature rain forest, an incre dibly complex ecosystem where one species’ existence is dependent on several others for survival. Now imagine that y ou just burned that rain forest to the ground with napalm, Agent Orange, or a carelessly discarded match. Even if you immediately replanted seeds for all the trees and p lants—the same way that people try to reseed their guts with probiotics—do you really think you will have a matu re rain forest in a few weeks? Now imagine that eve ry time your rain forest started to grow back, you hit it a gain with another round of napalm—comparable to tak ing a broad- spectrum antibiotic just because you have a cold th at gave you an annoying cough. There is an ongoing scorched- earth pattern where there should be a luxuriant gre en forest. Don’t get me wrong, targeted antibiotics can be lifesaving; but you should be very cautious about t aking broad-spectrum antibiotics for anything other than a life- threatening infection. And our consumption of antibiotics doesn’t just com e from filling a doctor’s prescription. Almost all American chicken or beef contains enough antibiotics to kill bacteria in a petri dish! You can bet that it indi scriminately kills the friendly bacteria in your gut. Until recently, it was perfectly legal to give organic free-range c hickens aresenic, producing a “healthy” pink blush. Wait, isn’t arsen ic a poison? Right you are. Besides being a poison and an antibiotic, arsenic is also a hormone disruptor tha t mimics the action of estrogen. A bill to ban the use of arsenic in chicken feed in Maryland was once defeated by a gen erous grant from Monsanto, which makes arsenic, to the campaigns of Maryland state senators. 7 The bill did later pass, and in 2013 the FDA banned the use of three of the four forms of arsenic nationally. 8 However, the fourth form, nitarsone, was exempted. As this book goes to press, it appears the FDA will finally ban this form as well. In addition, both soybeans and corn are used in ch icken feed, and both of these products also contain estrogenlik e substances. Ultimately, that “healthy” chicken br east boasts the equivalent of one birth control pill’s worth of est rogenic substances! The Risky Business of Diminished Efficacy I was in medical school in the 1970s when Clostridium difficile, which had been a relatively marginal microbe found in the colon, suddenly began to kill lots of people. The reason was that broad-spectrum drugs ha d come along"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"found in the colon, suddenly began to kill lots of people. The reason was that broad-spectrum drugs ha d come along and wiped out all sorts of microbes, including prot ective ones, in our intestinal tract. And when the good guys were gone, a gang member like Clostridium difficile stepped up and overran the colon. We should have r ealized that carpet-bombing would have such consequences, and in deed today, bacteria known as superbugs are resista nt to these antibiotics, creating a potentially life-thre atening situation for certain individuals. An epide mic, widespread resistance to certain antibiotics could have disast rous consequences. More recently, the heavy use of Baytril (Cipro’s si ster drug) to treat poultry against E. coli and a bacterial infection associated with respiratory disease has resulted in increased resistance on the part of humans who are given Cipro to combat a bacterial infection. 9 The FDA has acknowledged that human resistance is t roubling. But a turkey farmer is not going to dose a single sick turkey with Baytril ; instead, he adds the antibiotic to the water supp ly for the whole flock. And the problem doesn’t stop with Baytril, w hich is one of a class of powerful drugs known as fluoroquinolones. The FDA, physicians, and consumer groups are all co ncerned that Baytril’s heavy use on animals could m ake humans resistant to Cipro, which is used to treat s almonella, campylobacter, and other food-borne dise ases (as well as anthrax) in humans. This means that if a person consumes bacteria in inadequately cooked meat or ha ndles such meat improperly and becomes ill, s/he may not respo nd to treatment with Cipro. In fact, the urology te am at my hospital has found that at least 50 percent of all women with urinary-tract infections carry bugs that are resistant to Cipro. Broad-spectrum antibiotics make pigs, chickens, and other animals grow faster, larger, and fatter. And if they have that effect in animals, it’s unsurprising that they ’d do the same to humans. Believe it or not, a sing le dose of antibiotics taken by a woman during pregnancy can m ake her children fat. A single round of antibiotics given to a child can make him or her obese. By altering your i ntestinal flora, which communicate with your immune system, antibiotics cause your body to go into a war state, increasing fat storage so your immune cells have a ll the fuel they need to fight off these invaders. And antibiotic re sidues from the flesh and milk of animals only magn ify the effect when a person also takes broad-spectrum antibiotics . SUCCESS STORY Antibiotics Induced Crohn’s Disease Sara Y. is a seventy-one-year-old woman who was giv en repeated antibiotic doses for six weeks for a recurrent urinary-tract infection. She began to dev elop severe abdominal pain, followed by bloody diar rhea and severe joint pain and arthritis. Despite no pre vious history of gastrointestinal problems, a colon oscopy revealed Crohn’s disease. Then, rather than connect ing the dots, her doctor referred her to a rheumato logist who advised treatment with immunosuppressants (you see such drugs advertised daily on television). Thankfully, Sara refused a drug-based medical treat ment and instead sought my help. By eliminating lec tins from her diet and rebuilding the “rain forest” in h er gut with the Plant Paradox Program, she cured he rself in six months. DISRUPTOR 2: Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Known by the pharmaceutical industry as “gateway dr ugs” to more powerful painkillers, ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), Celebrex, Mobic, and oth er nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) we re introduced in the early 1970s as an alternative to aspirin, which was known to damage the stomach lini ng. However, we now know that NSAIDs damage the mucosal barrier in the small intestine and colon, allowing lectins, LPSs, and other foreign substances to pass through the intest inal wall, initiating a war within your body. Evide nce of the war is increasing inflammation, which you feel as pain. An d the more pain you have, the more NSAIDs you take. How could we not have known this? Actually, the pha rmaceutical companies did, 10 but because our gastroscopes"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"How could we not have known this? Actually, the pha rmaceutical companies did, 10 but because our gastroscopes didn’t reach that far, we doctors initially had no methods of seeing damage in the small intestine. It wasn’t until we had camera pills you could swallow that we realized what was really happening, and by then NSAIDs were ubiquitous. Remember that poor woman with the intes tinal webs? NSAIDs had so destroyed the walls of he r gut that massive amounts of scar tissue had formed. Tha t whole process opens up pathways to more invaders, while setting up a vicious cycle: the more LPSs that esca pe, the more pain; the more pain, the more you use NSAIDs— until you graduate to the big boys, the prescriptio n painkillers. NSAIDs are both the number-one pharm aceutical seller and the number-one health menace. So, rememb er this: Swallowing one Advil or Aleve is like swal lowing a hand grenade. Also remember: The precursors of Advi l and Aleve, ibuprofen and Naprosyn, were recognize d as so dangerous when they were introduced in the 1970s th at they were available only as prescription drugs. SUCCESS STORY The Student Who Came in from the Cold An avid rock climber and college student in Colorad o, Emily J. had injured her ankle in a fall about s ix months earlier. Her orthopedist had treated her wit h high doses of Motrin and Aleve, but after about a month into this therapy, she noticed that her hands and f eet were turning blue and that cold weather seemed to intensify the problem. This condition, known as Ray naud’s syndrome, is now believed to be an autoimmun e problem. Soon, Emily couldn’t even hold a pen and h ad to leave college. Hoping that the warm climate would provide relief, she came to spend the winter with her grandmother in Palm Springs. When things didn’t improve, she sought the help of a local yoga master and massage therapist, who referred her to me. When I met Emily, her hands and feet were cold and blue. Once I had heard her story, I knew that her g ut barrier had been breached by NSAIDs the orthopedist had prescribed, and that lectins and LPSs were on the loose in her system. Blood work confirmed these ass umptions, as well as a telltale low level of vitami n D, despite the fact that she was taking a large amount daily. We instituted the Plant Paradox Program, st arted her on probiotics and prebiotics, and pushed her bl ood level of vitamin D to 100 ng/ml. Two weeks late r, her hands and feet were changing color and within six w eeks had returned to normal. Emily resumed her stud ies in Colorado and has never looked back, except to sa y thank you. DISRUPTOR 3: Stomach-Acid Blockers Let me count the reasons acid-blocking drugs such a s Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, and Protonix are to be avoided at all costs. Most of these drugs are proton pump inhi bitors (PPIs), which reduce the amount of stomach a cid. However, as long as it stays where it belongs, stom ach acid serves an important function. The acid in the stomach is so powerful that only a few important bacteria can tolerate it as their hom e; as a result, many of the bad bacteria that you swallow never mak e it out alive. (By the way, unless they are in spo re form or enteric-coated, most of those expensive probiotic b acteria products you consume never make it out of y our stomach alive either!) Acids from the stomach normally conf ine bacteria to the large intestine through a proce ss called the acid gradient. As the contents from the stomach mov e farther down the intestine, more alkaline fluids from the bile and pancreas gradually dilute the acid, but it is o nly when food reaches the colon that the acid is fi nally sufficiently diluted. Bacteria in the colon, where most of our g ut bugs live, typically like an oxygen-free, low-ac id environment. Now here’s the problem: without stomach acid to kil l “bad” bacteria, these pathogenic (disease-produci ng) bacteria can overgrow, further altering normal gut flora. Mo reover, lacking stomach acid, bad bacteria and even good bacteria can easily crawl up from their designated home in the colon into your small intestine, where they don’t belong. There they either disrupt the gut barrier, the condition generally called leaky gut, or cause a condition called SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth). Once i n your small intestine, where they are not supposed to live, the bacterial cell walls (LPSs) and lectins have easy a ccess into your circulatory system. This in turn st imulates your"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"bacterial cell walls (LPSs) and lectins have easy a ccess into your circulatory system. This in turn st imulates your immune system to combat the incoming threats from L PSs and lectins with—you guessed it—inflammation! A nd with that comes weight gain, as your body stores fa t to fuel your white blood cells’ battle with the e nemies. The use of PPIs, such as Prilosec and Nexium, doesn ’t just interfere with the proper functioning of yo ur stomach acid. PPIs not only stop stomach acid production, b ut also can kill off your mitochondria’s ability to produce energy in every cell in the body via their own proton pump s. Remarkably, these PPIs cross the blood-brain bar rier and poison your brain’s mitochondria. One study showed a 44 percent increased risk of dementia among 74,00 0 people aged seventy-five and older who had used these drug s, compared with those who did not. 11 Other studies have linked the use of PPIs to chronic kidney disease fo r the same reason. 12 We have been systematically poisoning the energy-producing organelles in every one of our cel ls just to have another piece of pepperoni pizza. B ecause of these risks, all these over-the-counter drugs, as w ell as their prescription counterparts, come with a warning that you should never take them for more than two weeks. Non etheless, many people toss them down for years, res ulting in serious damage. When these acid blockers were intro duced in the 1980s, they were considered so dangero us that they had to be prescribed by a physician. Seeing a pattern here? The use of acid reducers also prompts a totally new population of intestinal bugs—those which are norm ally killed off by our stomach acid and are extremely foreign t o our immune system—to grow in place of our normal bugs. People who use acid blockers have three times the l ikelihood of getting pneumonia, 13 which these foreign bugs cause, than those who don’t use such drugs. If that isn’t bad enough, acid-blocking drugs also foster incomplete protein digestion. Since lectins are proteins, acid blockers therefore allow more lectins into the gut . Finally, because stomach acid is necessary to break down dietary protein into amino acids before they can be absorbed in your gut, we have produced an entire ge neration of senior citizens who are protein malnour ished. That’s not because they aren’t eating enough protein; inst ead, it is because they have no stomach acid to dig est it! When protein can’t be broken down and absorbed, it leads to muscle wasting, called sarcopenia, a health cri sis among the elderly. In fact, regardless of age and the reason they are in the hospital, most patients admitted to the hospital have very low levels of protein, not because they aren’t eating sufficient protein—in fact, they are eating too much, as I’ll explain soon—but because they cannot turn it into t he amino acids that can be absorbed, thanks to thei r regular intake of PPIs. SUCCESS STORY A Precancerous Condition Disappears Elena J. was sixty-seven years old and had suffered from severe heartburn most of her life. A few year s before Elena consulted me, her gastroenterologist h ad done a routine scope of her esophagus and taken some biopsies. The results confirmed that she had Barret t’s esophagus, a precancerous lesion of the lower esophagus. She was treated with double doses of PPI s, but the more of these drugs she took, the weaker she became and the more her belly hurt. When she came t o see me, Elena’s blood work revealed classic lecti n intolerance, and a low protein level—without acid i n her stomach, she couldn’t digest protein. I recommended that she follow the Plant Paradox Progr am and immediately stop taking Nexium and Protonix. “What about my gastroenterologist’s advice and the Barrett’s?” she asked. I assured her that as a cardiothoracic surgeon, I dealt with the esophagus daily and that we could handle any problem that cam e along. She dove in to the program, and to her surpr ise, her heartburn vanished and her stomach stopped hurting. Within six months, her protein levels had returned to normal. One year later, during her sche duled follow-up esophageal scope, her gastroenterologist was delighted to tell her that all signs of the Bar rett’s esophagus were gone, and her biopsies were negative . “Aren’t you glad you took two different acid reducers?” he asked. She nodded politely, but hasn’ t seen him since. When I asked Elena why she didn’t tell him what she had really done, she just sighed and s aid, “Do you really think he would have believed th at?”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"him what she had really done, she just sighed and s aid, “Do you really think he would have believed th at?” She’s right, but perhaps you will! Forbidden Trojan Horses I call the deadly disruptors “Trojan horses” becaus e the enemy is hidden inside, just as problematic l ectins lurk sneakily in many foods. Equally important to t he dietary changes you will make in the Plant Parad ox Program is the removal of products that are Trojan horses. In addition to eliminating broad-spectrum antibiotics (with your physician’s permission, of c ourse), you want to omit the sources of other deadl y disruptors and replace them with neutral substitute s. Consult the lists below. • PAIN-RELIEVER ENEMIES: Generic ibuprofen or Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn, Celeb rex, Mobic, and other NSAIDs. • Friendly Substitutes: Boswellia or white willow bark. • ACID-REDUCER ENEMIES: Zantac, Prilosec (omeprazole), Protonix, Nexium, a nd Imeprazole. • Friendly Substitutes: Rolaids are a low-sugar source of calcium carbonat e. Also chew DGL wafers. • SLEEP-AID ENEMIES: Ambien, Restoril, Lunesta, and Xanax. • Friendly substitutes: My favorite combination of sleep aids is in Schiff Melatonin Ultra, or buy time- release melatonin and take 3 to 6 mg before bed. DISRUPTOR 4: Artificial Sweeteners Products such as sucralose, saccharin, aspartame, a nd other nonnutritive artificial sweeteners alter t he gut holobiome, killing good bacteria and allowing overg rowth of bad ones. Believe it or not, a Duke study showed that a single Splenda packet kills 50 percent of normal intestinal flora! 14 And again, once the bad guys take over, you gain weight as a defense mechanism to ensure suppli es for your army of defenders. Ironically, although such products are supposed to aid in weight loss, they d o just the opposite. In addition, sweet tastes, once available only in s ummer from ripe fruit and perhaps the occasional ho neycomb, signal the body that it’s time to store fat for win ter, regardless of the actual season. (We now effec tively live in endless summer with fruit and sweet treats made wit h real or fake sugar available year-round—and aroun d the clock.) Taste buds for sweetness actually occupy tw o-thirds of the surface of your tongue. They are th ere to make sure that when high-caloric fruit or honey was avai lable, your ancient ancestors were certain to eat i t. Your taste buds don’t actually taste sugar; rather, when a sug ar molecule (or any other sweet substance) attaches to their receptor by fitting into the dock, they taste “swee t.” The nerves from your tongue transmit this “swee t” information to your pleasure receptors (docks) in your brain, w hich is your reward center. It in turn urges you to get more of this great stuff because you just won the fruit tree lot tery and you are going to be the big winner when wi nter arrives and there isn’t much food around. It’s the Sweetness, Not the Sugar Now here’s the problem with artificial or even natu ral (think stevia) noncaloric sweeteners. Your body can’t distinguish between the sweetness of sugar or other caloric sources and these calorie-free sweeteners. That’s because the molecular structure (pattern) of the ca lorie-free sweeteners fits into the sugar-docking p ort on your taste buds and prompts the same pleasure signal to your b rain that real sugar prompts. Then, when the calori es from real sugar (glucose) don’t arrive in your bloodstream an d are not detected by glucose receptors in your bra in, your brain feels cheated.

That’s why, despi te drinking eight Diet Cokes a day—they were practically glued to my hand—I was once seventy pounds overweight. An avalanche of research proves that instead of aiding in weight loss or weight maintenance, nonnutritive sweeteners actually cause you to gain weight. Listen to Your Internal Clock Nonnutritive sweeteners and sweet tastes are also e ndocrine disruptors (discussed below) and disrupt t he circadian rhythms of your body’s internal clock, another trig ger for weight gain. How so? All of your cells oper ate on a circadian clock; there’s even a clock gene. Anyone who has traveled across time zones knows what jet l ag feels like, and it happens because your circadian rhythm is dis rupted. Almost all bodily functions operate in circ adian fashion. Even your holobiome has circadian rhythms. Just as there are twenty-four-hour clocks, there are also m oon cycle clocks (believe me, emergency room visits for crazy behavior follow full moon cycles) and seasonal clo cks. These seasonal clocks are controlled not only by day leng th, but also by seasonal food availability. In the not-too-distant past, sweet tastes were not a year-round event. Ins tead, they correlated to fruit season, which always preceded winter, when food was of limited availability. Rega rdless of whether winter is a dry season, a wet sea son, or a cold season, there is cyclically less food in winter and more in summer. So when you eat sweet foods year-r ound, even if it is natural sugar from fruit, you disrupt this an cient rhythm and continually gain weight. As you wi ll soon learn, the year-round availability of fruit is one of the largest contributors to our obesity crisis. Artificial Sweetener Trojan Horses • THE ENEMY: All artificial sweeteners, specifically saccharin (Sweet’n Low, Sweet Twin, and Necta Sweet), aspartame (Equal and NutraSweet), acesulfam e K (also in Equal and NutraSweet), sucralose (Sple nda), and neotame. Also steer clear of soft drinks or spo rts drinks, any health or protein bar that contains any of these sweeteners, as well as any form of sugar, including corn, agave syrup, or pure cane sugar. Ditto for a ny processed foods with such sweeteners. • Friendly Substitutes: Stevia (SweetLeaf, which contains inulin), Just Li ke Sugar (made from chicory root), the sugar alcohols xylitol or erythritol (Sw erve), yacón syrup, and inulin. Use all in moderati on, particularly sugar alcohols, which can create gassi ness and diarrhea. • SPOILER ALERT: Any sweet taste, even from stevia, stimulates an i nsulin response that makes you want more, as discussed above. DISRUPTOR 5: Endocrine Disruptors Also called hormone disruptors, these low-dose estr ogenlike agents are a diverse group, encompassing c hemicals found in most plastics, scented cosmetics, preserva tives, and sunscreens, and other products as divers e as cash register receipts, along with dichlorodiphenyldichl oroethylene (DDE), which is a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (aka DDT), the inse cticide lindane, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB s). 15 All regularly play havoc with our hormones. According t o the Endocrine Society’s second statement on endoc rine disruptors, exposure to these powerful agents has b een found to affect individuals and test animals (a s well as their descendants) in multiple ways, some of which may no t show up for years. 16 Problems include: • Obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases • Both female and male reproductive issues • Women’s hormone-sensitive cancers"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"• Prostate problems • Thyroid problems • Impaired development of the brain and neuroendo crine systems Problematic Preservatives Many of the compounds in this class of agents are u sed as preservatives or stabilizers; a prime exampl e is butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT), which is used in processed fo ods, including whole-grain products. With the adven t of “healthy” whole-grain flour, the previously discard ed omega-6 fat in the bran oxidizes and goes rancid unless there’s a stabilizing agent like BHT to prevent spo ilage. Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in lightweight pla stic water bottles to make them tough and heat-resistant—and e ven in babies’ teething rings! 17 —as well as in the thin plastic lining of most canned goods to keep the metal from corroding and contaminating the contents. Parabens in cosmetics and sunscreens serve a similar purpose. M ethylparaben, an estrogenlike compound, is also a m ajor allergen, and is used to preserve most drug solutio ns in multiuse containers. If you thought that you were allergic to the painkiller novacaine at your dentist’s office, it was actually the methylparaben in the bottle. Recent research suggests that tert-butylhydroquinon et (tBHQ), a synthetic food preservative, may be re sponsible in part for the recent increase in food allergies. 18 The additive is used in numerous processed foods, i ncluding bread, waffles, crackers, and other baked goods, as well a s nuts and cooking oil. The presence of tBHQ in a p roduct need not be listed on the label. It seems that consuming tBHQ stimulates our T cells, which are key to our immune system, to release proteins that can stimulate an a llergic response to foods such as wheat, milk, eggs , nuts, and shellfish. Under normal conditions, T cells release cytokines, which protect the body from invaders, b ut the presence of tBHQ constrains the normal action of T cells. You probably know that antibacterial chemicals such as triclosan, found in hand sanitizers, soaps, deo dorants, toothpaste, and countless other personal care produ cts, destroy “good” microbes in your mouth and gut and and on your skin. However, you may not know that they also promote obesity by changing gut flora, as well as by acting like estrogen. And let me assure you that you need normal bugs in all of these places—including your m outh. These good bugs in your mouth are responsible for taking compounds that you exhale and converting them into a potent chemical that dilates your blood vessels and promot es normal blood pressure. The use of mouthwashes, w hich kill mouth bacteria as they give you that “minty clean” breath, dramatically increases blood pressure. 19 If you use mouthwash and have been told you need to take medic ation to lower your blood pressure, ditch the mouth wash ASAP. Triclosan in hand sanitizers and toothpaste h as also been shown to produce bladder cancer and to stimulate precancerous cells to proliferate. The next time yo u enter the supermarket, step away from the sanitiz er dispenser and no one gets hurt—especially your gut bugs. Depletion of Vitamin D Sunscreens prevent the absorption of vitamin D. But all the compounds discussed above, whether in suns creens or other products, also lower your liver’s ability to convert this critical vitamin to its active form. T his prevents the regeneration of new cells in your protective intest inal wall barrier, allowing more lectins and LPSs t hrough, along with other foreign bodies. Men with prostate cancer have very low levels of vitamin D. Despite the fac t that my practice is in Southern California, I have found th at almost 80 percent of my patients have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. In fact, anyone in my practice with leaky gut or autoimmune diseases has low levels. L acking sufficient vitamin D, and in the face of repeated a ssaults on the walls of the intestine and the lack of ongoing repair to keep out lectins and LPSs, the body constantly s enses that it is at war. It’s not surprising, then, that most of my overweight and obese patients are also very deficie nt in vitamin D. 20 Such a deficiency also impedes the generation of new bone, setting the stage for the development of osteoporosis. My thin female patients with osteo penia and osteoporosis also have low levels of this critical vitamin when they first come to see me."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Fat-Storage Hormone Most hormone disruptors mimic the action of estroge n, whose main purpose is to tell cells to store fat in anticipation of an upcoming pregnancy. Now, 365 days a year, we store fat for an upcoming pregnancy regardless of o ur age or even our gender! Is it any wonder, then, that girls are coming into puberty at age eight or that guys have “man boobs” and a gut that looks suspiciously like they are about to give birth? Instead of hooking up to a receptor and then leaving, the way regular hormones do, estrogen like compounds attach to a receptor and remain perm anently switched on, disrupting normal messaging. The cumul ative effect of these minute amounts of estrogenlik e compounds is actually more powerful than the hormon e itself would be. 21 BPA is banned in Canada and Europe, but in 2015 a lawsuit in the United States attempti ng to force the FDA to ban BPA was defeated, thanks to a large grant to congressional campaigns by the American Ch emical Council, which opposed the bill. 22 Fear Those Phthalates If you find your tongue tripping over the word “pht halates,” take it as a warning. These synthetic com pounds, which began to appear early in the twentieth century, are ubiquitous. They are used to soften plastics—think wall coverings, vinyl flooring, the gloves you wear when washing dishes, the trays used to package meat and fish, the plastic wrap you cover leftovers with, even the toy s your children play with, and on and on. Thanks to plastic wraps and plastic containers, phthalates are omnipresent in our foods. Phthalates also act as solvents in pe rfumed items, turning up in hair sprays, lubricants, insect repel lents, and thousands of other household and persona l care products. Specific chemicals in the phthalates family include equally difficult to pronounce names such as dicyc lohexyl phthalate (DCHP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di- n -octyl phthalate (DnOP), and bisphenol S (BPS). Animal and human studies have associated phthalates with many examples of endocrine disruption, includ ing smaller than usual testicles in rats. 23 The presence of highly concentrated phthalate metab olites in men’s urine has been associated with damage to the DNA in sperm. 24 Being exposed to these chemicals at a young age may be associated with premature breast development in gir ls. 25 Babies whose umbilical cords reveal higher exposure to phthalates are more likely to have been born premat urely. 26 These compounds are major hormone disruptors, locking onto estrogen receptors in the fetal brain, as well as in you and your children. They also per manently attach to the thyroid hormone receptors on cells, blocking the real thyroid hormone from delivering its messa ge. Think of a plane blocking the Jetway that you want to use. Studies have been conducted in Europe, Canada, and China in an effort to establish how much of this cl ass of chemicals is in their food supply, but the first Am erican study did not take place until 2013. 27 It looked at a relatively pristine upstate New York population, an d found that the major sources of phthalates in hum ans were obtained from (in order of rank) grains, beef, pork , chicken, and milk products. So, if you are tired and fat and your hair is thinning, and you are eating whole-grain fo ods and boneless skinless chicken breast, and your doctor assures you that your thyroid hormone levels are normal, so you can’t be hypothyroid, think again. You may be making thyroid hormone, but it can’t get into the gate and off the plane to talk to each of your cells becaus e phthalates are blocking the way. These phthalate-laden “healthy fo ods” are some of the very items you will be omittin g (or severely restricting) on the Plant Paradox Program. Arsenic in Our Food—No Kidding You’ll recall that arsenic, which can be found in c hicken, is a not just an antibiotic and a poison, b ut also a hormone disruptor. Chicken has become a large part of the s tandard American diet, replacing beef, lamb, pork, and other meats. But here’s something to stop you in your tra cks: The more chicken a pregnant woman consumes, th e smaller her baby boy’s penis 28 and shorter his attention span. Arsenic and phthala te contamination also influence his choice of toys and his behavior. 29 Research on rats suggests that greater chicken cons umption, and therefore increased exposure to arsenic and phthalates, exposes the bra ins of male babies to estrogen mimetics in utero (i n addition to"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"exposure to arsenic and phthalates, exposes the bra ins of male babies to estrogen mimetics in utero (i n addition to the mother’s real estrogen), which impacts sexual i mprinting and potentially gender identity. Another Reason to Avoid Bread Would you want to eat your yoga mat? Well, azodicar bonamide, an endocrine disruptor that is employed a s a foaming agent in the manufacture of synthetic leath er products, carpet underlayment, and yoga mats, is also used to bleach flour and condition dough. 30 Most fast food restaurants, including Wendy’s, McDo nald’s, Burger King, and Arby’s, use it in some or all of their bread produc ts. The use of azodicarbonamide in bread has been b anned in Europe 31 and Australia. In this country, Subway has voluntar ily eliminated it from its products. 32 Exposure to azodicarbonamide has been shown to provoke asthma a nd allergies, 33 as well as to suppress immune function, 34 particularly when it is heated or baked. Additional ly, this chemical has been shown to break down glut en into its individual proteins, gliadin and glutinin, making t hem more immediately available and therefore more i mmediately irritating. Endocrine Disruptor Trojan Horses These powerful disruptors are in countless products . The following are just the tip of the iceberg. • ENEMIES: Any food that uses BHT as a stabilizing agent, par ticularly commercial baked goods. Hint: It is likely that BHT has been added if the food comes in a wrapper or has the words “whole grain.” (Don’t f orget that any cracker, bread, cookie, or “crunchy” bar p robably also contains transglutaminase.) Food manuf acturers are not required to list this chemical on the packa ging. • Friendly Substitute: Homemade baked goods using approved flour substitu tes (see here ). • ENEMIES: Teflon, the brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and similar products used on nonstick cookware, as well as on stain-resistant fa brics and carpeting. Perfluorooctanoic octanoic aci d (PFOA) is also used in some nonstick cookware. • Friendly Substitute: Use conventional cookware or those with a ceramic coating that are certified to contain no PTFE or PFOA made by T-fal, Amoré, Culin a, and other manufacturers. • ENEMIES: Containers made of BPA plastic. • Friendly Substitutes: Buy products (and store leftovers) in glass or sta inless steel containers, which are nonreactive. Purchase canned foods only in BPA-free cans. Some bottled water is sold in non-BPA plasti c, but it is debatable that these plastics are any saf er. Just when you thought it was safe to get back i n the water —pun intended—it turns out that BPS causes the same if not more problems as BPA. 35 Purchase a stainless steel or glass water bottle (one with a protective wrapper) and use your own tap or filtered water ins tead. • ENEMIES: Plastic wrap and plastic bags. • Friendly Substitutes: Old-fashioned wax paper works, or reusable cloth s andwich bags (sold on Etsy). • ENEMIES: Store and bank receipts printed with thermal paper , which may or may not contain BPA. • Friendly Substitutes: Have your bank receipt emailed to you. If you need the receipt from a store in case you have to return something, ask the salesperson t o put it in the bag. When you get home, use kitchen tongs to remove it. Wash your hands after touching receip ts. Photograph receipts with your smart phone and t hen get rid of them. Encourage vendors you use often to switch to BPA-free paper such as that made by Appleton. • ENEMIES: Sunscreens with parabens, such as methylparaben.

DISRUPTOR 6: Genetically Modified Foods and the Herbicide Round up Herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides are differ ent forms of biocides. Herbicides kill weeds, allow ing a crop plant to grow without having to compete for water and nut rients with other species. Insecticides have helped reduce the number of victims of mosquito-borne diseases, while pesticides have improved crop yield and provided f ood for billions who would have likely otherwise died of st arvation. But the unintended consequences of biocid es are just as momentous. They have introduced powerful poisons in to our systems from the food we eat, even the produ ce we touch, and sadly, the animals we eat. These poisons hack in via our intestinal tract or our skin, unle ashing genetic programs within us, as well as in other animals and plants. The compounds are rogue pattern matchers t hat turn genes on or off within our cells, fundamentally cha nging the signaling within the body. 36 The herbicides Roundup, made by Monsanto, and Enlis t, made by Dow Chemical, both contain 2,4-D (an ingredient in the notorious Agent Orange) and glyph osate. Traces of both these major disruptors are fo und in the meat and milk of animals that are fed grains and be ans, as well as in crop plants and products made wi th them. A brief history is in order here. Genetically modif ied organisms (GMOs) were created by inserting fore ign genes into plants, with the objective of making the plant either produce more of its own insecticides (lecti ns) or produce resistance to Roundup. In theory, Roundup would kil l the weeds around the crop, leaving the GMO plant protected. Sounds logical. Short-term studies suggested that the residual Roun dup on the grains or beans would cause no harm to h umans, as we lack what is called the shikimate pathway, or th e plant pathway that Roundup uses to paralyze weeds , thus leading to their death. As a result, Roundup was ap proved as safe by the FDA. So what’s the problem? F irst, the GMO plant produces novel proteins and/or lectins th at our bar-code scanners recognize as foreign, caus ing inflammation when we eat them. Second, when Roundup is sprayed on a GMO crop, the crop can withstand t he chemical onslaught while the nearby weeds wither an d die. However, industrial farmers now routinely ap ply Roundup as a desiccant to non-GMO crops as well. A dried-up dead plant makes it easier to harvest whea t, corn,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Roundup as a desiccant to non-GMO crops as well. A dried-up dead plant makes it easier to harvest whea t, corn, soybean, beans, and canola on a fixed schedule, sav ing time and money with a single sweep of the field . Now, if you naïvely think that Roundup is washed of f the harvested grains before they are processed, I ’ve got some oceanfront property here in Palm Springs to sell yo u. That glyphosate remains on the grains and beans and is fed to our livestock in feed lots and incorporated into th eir fat, meat, and milk, which you then eat or drin k. Almost all grains and beans fed to industrial farm animals are also GMO. These altered genes have been found not only in the meats of these animals, but also in the milk of nur sing mothers and the umbilical cord blood of their infants! But, worse, since Roundup is used to harvest almost all non-GMO grains and beans as well, you consume it di rectly via these “healthy” foods, because the outer part of th e grain, once routinely stripped away in processing , is now left on for “whole-grain goodness.” 37 Roundup is then delivered into your gut where it do es its real damage. Just like plants, gut bacteria utilize the shikimat e pathway, and they do so to make three essential a mino acids: tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Since anim als lack this pathway, our only source of these ess ential amino acids is via our gut bugs. Tryptophan and phenylala nine make serotonin, the essential “feel good” horm one, while tyrosine and phenylalanine are essential for thyroi d hormone production. But when we eat GMO foods or conventionally grown foods harvested with Roundup, the shikimate pathway is blocked and our gut bacter ia are unable to produce these essential amino acids. Let me reiterate this critical point: Because non-G MO foods are now routinely harvested by spraying Ro undup on them, and given the fact that all livestock and pou ltry are fed these grains and beans, you get a doub le whammy of Roundup even if you avoid GMO crops. Is it any wond er my skinny whole-grain-eating female patients wer e on antidepressants and thyroid medication? The glyphos ate in whole grains, soybeans, and other beans had poisoned these women’s own production of serotonin and tyros ine. This not only paralyzes the shikimate pathway and hinders our supply of those three amino acids, but also alters the composition of our normal gut flora by causing good gut bugs to die off. That’s a lot to take in, but here’s the worst part. Our normal gut bugs have evolved to eat gluten. If you kill these guys off by eating gluten-containing foods, beans, or soy that has been sprayed with Roundup, you sudd enly lose your main defense that made gluten harmless for the vast majority of us. That means you, too, become g luten- sensitive. On top of that, Roundup also bonds with gluten, making it antigenic (capable of inducing an immune response) even to people who aren’t sensitive to gl uten itself. 38 But wait, I’m not done yet. Roundup also paralyzes key liver enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes) that co nvert vitamin D to a form that your body can use to recycle cholesterol—meaning Roundup effectively raises your cholesterol! Plus, you need that vitamin D to fost er repair of your now-damaged gut wall. 39 Again: you are what you eat, and what the things yo u are eating, ate. Frightening Results In 2015, the International Agency for Research, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, de clared glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, a “pr obable human carcinogen.” 40 As a result, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and the Feed the World Project (n ow the Detox Project) teamed up to offer the public the opportunity to have their water or urine tested for glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. The response was so overwhelming that testing has temporarily been s uspended, pending construction of a larger lab. But the results of the first 131 individuals who submitted specimen s are staggering. According to results released in May 2016, 93 percent of the urine samples tested positive for gl yphosate, with children showing the highest levels. (No glyphosate turned up in water samples.) People who lived in th e western and midwestern states generally had highe r levels than individuals in other parts of the United States. Pr esumably, because the OCA partnered this program, t he test subjects were more likely to consume organic foods than the general public, meaning that either organi c food has been contaminated or there are other as yet unknown sources of glyphosate. A laboratory at the Univers ity of California San Francisco did the testing, the first such comprehensive and validated project conducted in this country."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The organizers of the testing program are hoping no t only to inform the public of the risks of glyphos ate, but also to persuade the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency t o ban the chemical, which is currently under review . Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA ) does not currently test food for glyphosate resid ues, citing the high cost as a deterrent. However, the FDA anno unced in early 2016 that it would begin testing foo ds such as soybeans, corn, milk, and eggs at some unspecified future date. 41 (The OCA and Detox Project are now offering food testing to nongovernmental organizations and c ommercial companies only for $176 per sample.) The United States lags behind other countries in ex amining and addressing risks posed by glyphosate. I n 2013, El Salvador banned this endocrine-disrupting agent bec ause it was linked to the deaths of thousands of ag ricultural workers from chronic kidney disease. And the Europe an Union continues to ban the use of Roundup in EU countries, a position diametrically opposed to that of the United States. The permit for continued use of glyphosate is up fo r renewal in 2017 in the United States, amid fierce debate on its risks and merits. There are some efforts to ban the use. A growing number of scientists are risking at tack by the biotech industry by releasing studies that link gly phosate to cancer, kidney and liver failure, birth defects, infertility, increased risk of allergies, and digestive issues, among other chronic illnesses. 42 Sealed documents reveal that Monsanto has been aware of the devastating health e ffects of the chemical for forty years. 43 According to Ronnie Cummins, the international dire ctor of the OCA, in a press release announcing the program for testing water and urine for Roundup, “We hope t hat at the very least, states—and eventually the fe deral government—will require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms, 84 perc ent of which are grown with glyphosate and likely contain residues of the chemical. But ultimately, this dang erous chemical must be banned.” 44 Ironically, the use of GMO crops was supposed to in crease production levels of crops and reduce the us e of herbicides. But according to an in-depth examinatio n by the New York Times, using data from the Food and Agricultural Department of the United Nations, the Union of Industries of Plant Protection (France), t he U.S. Geological Survey, and the USDA’s National Agricult ure Statistics Service, these promises have not bee n realized. 45 In actuality, crop yield per acre in Canada and the United States has indeed increased over the last t wenty years, after GMO crops were introduced. However, they have also increased, and often at a higher rate, in Wes tern Europe, which banned GMO crops and relies solely on conventionally grown agriculture. Moreover, in the last decade, the use of the herbicides, including the we ed killer Roundup, has increased dramatically in th e United States in this time frame. Meanwhile, France has reduced i ts herbicide use dramatically.

You want to st ay away from all products with these labels. Here are the r eal meanings of these coded messages: Coded Message Translation “All vegetarian feed” Contains grains, pseudo-grains, and/or soy, all li kely GMO. Often found on poultry products. “Free-range” According to a 2007 federal law, chickens labeled free-range (or cage-free) can be crammed inside a warehouse and fed corn and soybean s as long as a door to a small patch of grass is left open for at least 5 mi nutes a day. Of course, under crowded conditions, most chickens never see the lig ht of day. “Gluten-free” More sugar and lectins than the gluten-containing p roduct it replaced. “All natural” So are hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and ars enic! This is a meaningless term, as neither the FDA nor the USDA has defined it. “No cholesterol” The fats that replace cholesterol are actually full of bad omega-6 fats. “No trans fats” Again, there are mostly bad omega-6 fats in this pr oduct. “Partially hydrogenated” There are really bad omega-6 fats in here. “No artificial ingredients” There is nothing “artificial” in rat droppings, eit her! At best, this is meaningless. “Heart healthy” Big Food and Big Pharma want you to eat this! And by the way, one product certified as “heart healthy” by the FDA is Froot Lo ops! However, avocado, salmon, and nuts don’t pass muster by the FDA. Go f igure. “All organic ingredients” Buyer, beware. Arsenic is organic and it is legal to feed it to so-called organic chickens. It is a major antibiotic and endocrine di sruptor. GMO crops, if raised organically, can be also labeled “organic.” Finally, please don’t be misled by the organic, fre e-range label when it comes to poultry. I cannot em phasize enough that it means that these birds were kept in a warehouse (with access to the outdoors, although they have likely never actually ventured out), and were fed organic corn and soybeans. And if the label say s “fed an all vegetarian diet,” put the package down and s tep away from the meat counter. Chickens are insectivores, not grain eaters. In addition, if the label on your fish says it is organic Scottish, No rwegian, or Canadian salmon, put it back. This means that it wa s fed organic grains and soybeans. Do you really th ink they followed the salmon around to see if they were eating “organic” seaweed? Likewise for organic bee f—if the label does not specify that the animal was gras s-fed and grass-finished, suspect a trick. All cows at some point in their life eat grass. Therefore, in theory and in practice, all beef can be—and is—labeled gr ass-fed, even though that cow spent most of its life eating grains and beans in a feedlot. DISRUPTOR 7: Constant Exposure to Blue Light For millennia, we and all other animals have acquir ed food in response to changes in daylight, and spe cifically to the blue wavelength spectrum of daylight.

This seas onal cycling between the use of glucose for fuel an d the use of fat for fuel is termed metabolic flexibility. And the i nstructions for this cycling are mediated by the bl ue spectrum of light. Modern life is dominated by blue light, creating an unnatural and practically nonstop exposure to this wavelength. Televisions, cell phones, tablets, other electronic devices, and even certain energy-saving lightbulbs emit light in the blue range of the spectrum, which is known to i nterfere with sleep. Blue light suppresses the prod uction of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep, and sleep deprivation is associated with obesity. 46 Blue light also stimulates ghrelin and cortisol, which are, respect ively, the “hunger” and “awake” hormones. And becau se our genetic programming associates blue light with dayl ight, this constant exposure tricks our bodies into thinking we’re perpetually in the season with longer dayligh t hours (summer). This prompts us to constantly pac k on pounds in anticipation of the shorter daylight hours of up coming winter, which never arrives, thanks to elect ric lights. Now that this ancient rhythm has been completely disrup ted, we live in 365 days of “endless summer.” For a ll these reasons, I recommend that you minimize your exposur e to blue light in the evenings. Blue Light Trojan Horses • ENEMY: Constant exposure to blue spectrum light. • Friendly Substitutes: • Download an app (justgetflux.com) to change the blue light emitted from any device’s screen to an amber tint when the sun sets, by simply typing in y our zip code. Utilize the yellow screen option on y our iPhone or Android. The new iOS has an easy-to-use “ Night-Shift” function. • When the sun goes down and you use your cell ph one or other electronic devices, wear amber-tinted, blue light-blocking glasses, which are made by Uvex , Solar Shield, Pixel, and many other companies. A wraparound style blocks blue light coming from the side as well as that from directly in front of you. • Replace the bulbs in your bedroom (if not all r ooms) with blue-blocking bulbs. I particularly like the Good Night Biological LED Lamp made by Lighting Sci ence (www.lsgc.com), which was originally developed for NASA astronauts. In Cahoots with Lectins HOW DO THE Seven Deadly Disruptors come together with lectins to make us fat and sick? The damage we have sustained from lectins makes us all the more vulner able to the additional assaults caused by the disru ptors. When LPSs and lectins breach the intestine’s containment walls, your body goes on the defensive. In order t o have sufficient calories to fuel the white blood cells ( your immune army) fighting the war within your body , your muscles become insulin- and leptin-resistant. We’re insulin-resistant and leptin-resistant (often call ed metabolic syndrome) not because we’re fat; instead, we’re fat because we’re saving calories for the war effort , as the following chapter elucidates. Thanks to the combination of hormonal confusion and circadian rhythm confusion caused by these disrupt ors and the ongoing release of lectins and LPSs into our bo dies, we have unleashed a total shock to our normal operating system. In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into this very subject to help you understand why we ha ve become fatter, sicker, and less fit over the last half cen tury. You’ll also learn why these problems are not your fault. Now, let’s understand where that fat is stored and why i t’s there."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"5 How the Modern Diet Makes You Fat (and Sick) You are probably still unsure whether that long lis t of conditions (including being overweight) found here can be resolved by following the Plant Paradox Program. Bu t as has been shown in peer-reviewed medical journa ls, simply changing your diet and making some lifestyle change s can effect amazing changes in your overall health . As the sixteenth-century British naturalist and physician Thomas Muffet wrote, “Men dig their graves with the ir own teeth and die by those fated instruments more than the we apons of their enemies.” Five centuries later, his words still ring true, as does Hippocrates’s famous declaration: “Le t food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” Now, my belief in these complementary statements is not just a matter of faith. It stands on the bedro ck of evidence: my research, the research of others, and the thousa nds of people who arrived in my office complaining of a variety of ailments and have since cured themselves by foll owing my eating plan. Many of my patients initially were also carrying around excess pounds. Once they began the program, weight loss was almost inevitable, usually without major effort. A Healthy Weight I KNOW THAT many of you are eager to get to the weight-loss pa rt of this book, but hold your horses just a bit longer. It’s important to first understand that any tendency to pack on extra pounds and any difficult y slimming down are not because you are a lazy or undiscipline d person. If you are carrying around extra baggage, the likely reason is because you are eating the wrong foods an d/or not eating the right foods. In my experience, what the Plant Paradox Program removes from your diet is more impo rtant than what it adds. That’s my first point. But second, disease issues and weight issues are often inextric ably linked, which is why this chapter deals with b oth. Another key point that is not on most people’s rada r is the role that our gut bugs play—not only in he alth and disease, but also in maintaining a normal weight. S ome microbes help keep you slim and healthy. Other gut bugs contribute to weight gain. Still other bugs that ma ke you sick may interfere with the absorption of nu trients and make it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. You could be stuffing yourself with food, but if your gut bugs aren’t facilitating proper digestion, you may be missing o ut on both calories and micronutrients. Celiac dise ase is just the tip of the malnutrition iceberg; numerous other con ditions can interfere with proper digestion and nut rient availability as well. SUCCESS STORY Usher Loses Pounds and Gets the Role My assistant got a call from a Mr. Raymond who want ed to thank me personally for what I had done for h im with the Plant Paradox Program. I was puzzled since I didn’t know anyone by that name and didn’t recal l ever giving a Mr. Raymond my two-page list of foods to eat and avoid; but I was intrigued, so I picked up the phone. Usher Raymond IV was on the line. Yes, t hat Usher. It seems that he had been cast to play S ugar Ray Leonard in the movie Hands of Stone . When the real Sugar Ray met Usher, the boxer size d him up and said he was too fat to play him! Now, if you have e ver seen Usher, “fat” would not be a description th at you would use. Seven percent body fat is not fat. But t here it was; Usher was too fat to play Sugar Ray. S o Usher went on the Paleo diet, then a gluten-free diet, an d finally a raw vegan diet. He also worked out for five or six hours a day. Nothing worked. Did he need to exercis e more, or cut more calories? He was so frustrated he"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"hours a day. Nothing worked. Did he need to exercis e more, or cut more calories? He was so frustrated he nearly gave up. Around this time, Usher’s agent was visiting a girl friend in New York who had been following the Plant Paradox Program with great success. The agent took a copy of the food list off the refrigerator and we nt back to Usher. Fifteen dropped pounds later, Usher was o n the phone with me. He was now Sugar Ray! He had been eating everything he wanted from the “good” pa ge and avoided everything on the “bad” page. By following this two-page list, he had lost the weigh t he needed to. Miraculous? Not at all—just the per fect functioning of a perfectly designed system. Now Ush er wants the world to know about the plant paradox. I know how frustrating diets and exercise can be in attaining an elusive goal. What if that goal was j ust waiting for you to attain it? What if perfect weigh t and health was the natural consequence of allowin g your own nature to thrive, once the obstructions from “h ealthy” foods and “all-natural” products were remov ed from your life? That is what the Plant Paradox Prog ram can do. The Weight War—and More BEING OVERWEIGHT (or underweight) is a clear signal—but only one—th at there is a war being waged within your body. If you are reading this book, I can assu me that you are concerned about the state of your h ealth—and likely your weight. You are in good company. In hin dsight, something started to go awry with our colle ctive health in the mid-1960s. You’ll recall that today, 70.7 pe rcent of American adults are overweight. Of those, almost 38 percent are obese, up from less than 20 percent two decades ago. 1 Additionally, there has been a huge increase in the incidence of diabetes, asthma, arthritis, cance r, heart disease, osteoporosis, Parkinson’s disease , and dementia. One in four people now has one or more of the dozen s of autoimmune diseases. Despite the fact that mos t of us now work only seven- or eight-hour days and are better fed than our grandparents, many of us suffer from l ow energy. There’s also a dramatically higher incidence of all ergies. There are now even EpiPens, syringes filled with adrenaline, marketed to worried parents for their k ids to carry to school so they can inject themselve s in case some other kid opens a package of peanuts. Peanuts didn’ t kill us back in 1960. We’ve blamed the Western diet, the environment, and inactivity for our poor health and excess pounds. Although the current advice on each of these subjects may co ntain a grain of truth, each misses the big truth. Not that these actions or inactions don’t also contribute to poor health, but they are not the primary cause of our health crisis. That’s why a diet or an exercise program may work f or a few weeks, or maybe even a few months—but then it all falls apart, and you’re back to square one. Sound f amiliar? The reason none of these “solutions” produ ces lasting change is that they do little or nothing to end bot h the battle of the bulge and the related battle wi thin your body. SUCCESS STORY The Artist Who Couldn’t Make Art The sister of a seventy-seven-year-old Japanese scu lptor brought him to see me. Hobbled and stooped ov er, walking with a considerable limp, he reached out hi s gnarled hand and I was shocked to see the arthrit is that wracked his body. He spoke little English, but his sister recounted the sad story about how this rever ed sculptor of massive wood carvings could no longer c reate his art. He was unable to hold a hammer and c hisel, a carving knife, or a brush (he also painted, usual ly on large canvases). On the advice of his orthope dic surgeon, the sculptor was chewing Motrin, Advil, an d Aleve like candy, and he was scheduled for a knee replacement, to be followed by a hip replacement. H e had come to me for cardiac clearance for the operations. I suggested the Plant Paradox Program a nd he agreed. With a little help from his sister, I showed him the two-page list and the foods to avoid. He al so stopped the NSAIDs immediately. Four months later, the sculptor returned, this time with no limp. He jumped out of the chair and shook my hand vigorously. Then, acting like he had a paintbr ush in his hand, he waved it on an invisible canvas ,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"hand vigorously. Then, acting like he had a paintbr ush in his hand, he waved it on an invisible canvas , smiling and saying, “Paint, paint, paint!” While do ing this, he was literally prancing about the exam room. “What about the knee operation?” “No,” he replied. “Knee good! No operation!” That was two years ago. I saw him and his sister re cently and he brought in a cover story from the Los Angeles Times on an exhibit of his collected works at the Hammer Museum. Many of his finest and largest were done in the last two years. No longer wracked with pain, he was enjoying presenting his great tal ent to the world. Amazing but True: Smaller Bodies and Brains Based on ancient skeletal remains, we know that twe lve thousand years ago humans averaged six feet in height. However, by 8000 BCE, the average human had shrunk to four feet ten inches—that’s a whopping fourteen inches in just a few thousand years! Our a ncestors became much shorter after the agricultural revolution, which is when grains and legumes became staples of the diet. And prior to that time, there is no evidence of arthritis in skeletal remains. In contr ast, all skeletons of modern people, except those w ho don’t eat many lectin-containing foods, have arthritis. ( You’ll recall that the mummified remains of ancient Egyptians revealed that they suffered from arthriti s a mere two millennia after starting to cultivate grains.) And it doesn’t stop there: the size of the human br ain was 15 percent larger twelve thousand years ago than it is today! And we call that progress? The Failure of “Diets” and the Exercise Conundrum AN INDICATION OF our concern with our health and weight is our obse ssive focus on weight-loss diets, despite our ongoing failure to convert that concern to last ing results. “Diets” are among the myths that have distracted us from the real issues regarding our health. But weig ht-loss diets are doomed to fail because they don’t address the underlying sabotage of our foods and other products we come in contact with. The recent revelation tha t most of the “winners” on The Biggest Loser reality show had regained most of their weight aft er their original “success” was ballyhooed on TV should come as no surprise to most “dieters.” If you have come to the conclusion that 99 percent of all such weight-loss programs are useless in the long run, I commend you for seeing the harsh light of day. End the war within your body and you will find your weight normalizes as well. An integral part of sel f-healing is achieving the weight your body “wants” to be. You’l l also significantly increase your longevity odds. But dieting to slim down and then reverting to your past habits is never a real fix. On the other hand, changing your way of eating and other habits once you understand the effects of certain foods (and certain products) on your syste m is a whole different ball game. And that is the game plan I wi ll be presenting to you. Diet, as in a way of eating, is the key to success. Numerous studies show that exercise doesn’t help yo u lose weight. One problem with exercise is it make s you hungry. Another is that for the vast majority of pe ople who are significantly overweight, it hurts to exercise so they don’t stick with it. But this is not to say that ex ercise, as in living an active lifestyle, is pointl ess. A huge study shows that regular exercise (and not just as a work out at the gym, but an overall commitment to being active) can be a valuable aid in helping you maintain your weight. 2 Moreover, staying physically fit has numerous other benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, moderati ng your blood pressure, boosting your HDL (“good”) cholesterol, and lowering your triglycerides. Both aerobic exercise and weight-bearing exercise also i mprove your balance (so you are less likely to injure yourself in a fall), lift your mood and alleviate stress, up your energy level, and enhance the quality of your sleep. And that’s j ust for starters. What Research Is All About"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"EVER SINCE DEFENDING my thesis on the biological and social factors dri ving human evolution for my graduation requirements at Yale University, I have been fascinated with the effect of food and the cho ices of food on human evolution and population growth. I used th is knowledge and the subsequent human research stud ies I performed at my institute to develop the program th at resulted in Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution. However, this was just a stepping-stone to what I have learned in the years since. Just as humans have evolved as a spec ies, my research has resulted in an evolution in my thinkin g—and it started with a visit to Metagenics, a majo r nutriceutical manufacturer. I had been asked to address its scien tific team about the principles of my book. At that time, I was a full-bore carbophobic—a code word for one who belie ves that carbohydrates (sugars) are evil and the ca use of all disease. I had severely restricted them in my dieta ry plan. After I presented my data and hypotheses, one of the Metagenics researchers stood up and asked, “How do you explain the Kitavans?” Those darn Kitavans! This South Pacific tribe is th e bane of existence to low-carb, fat-is-king resear chers. Kitavans smoke like fiends and get approximately 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrates and 30 percent from coconut oil. Despite this, they don’t have heart at tacks, strokes, or other indicators of cardiovascul ar disease and they are remarkably thin, all the while living long and disease-free lives with little need for medica l care. Low-carb advocates, my former self included, have long dismi ssed the Kitavans as exceptions to the rule, citing (without evidence, I might add) that their remarkable health is secondary to eating a calorie-restricted diet, with its known positive effects on health and longevity. Case clos ed, right? Not so fast. The primary duty of a researcher is to constantly test your hypothesis. Indeed, the actua l purpose of research is to prove that your hypothesis is wrong! Only if you cannot prove it wrong can it possibly be right. So, after initially waving off the Kitavans as calorie- restricted freaks of nature, I went back to my rese arch from Yale and beyond, looking for the driving forces behind a ny culture’s food selection. And I discovered, than ks to the work of Staffan Lindeberg, that despite the fact that th ey consume a large number of calories, the Kitavans are very skinny. The calorie is a calorie (calories in equal s calories out) argument seemingly doesn’t apply to Kitavans. Research (re-search) means to look again, and so I did. This chapter is the result of that second look , and of observing what happened to my patients when I appli ed these new insights. The Real Reasons for a Choice WE HAVE ALREADY discussed how approximately ten thousand years ago , most humans traded a nomadic hunter-gatherer existence for an agriculture-based lifestyle. The foods previously consumed were prima rily seasonal fruits (available only once a year), seasonal big g ame, and fish and shellfish, along with a significa nt reliance on starches in plant tubers, which could be utilized b y roasting after mankind discovered how to harness fire about one hundred thousand years ago. Although this regimen w ould have provided abundant calories, the number of humans on the planet remained minuscule. Then, suddenly, c alories began to come from the grains of grasses, l egumes, and —in the case of all cultures except Asians—milk fro m cows, sheep, and goats. The traditional theory of why our forebears transit ioned to these foods was that these crops could be stored and the animals herded. You could grow grains and beans in one season, but once dried and properly stored, the y would not wilt or rot. Cows and other bovines could be milked , and the milk could be used immediately or turned into cheese (which could also be stored). Because these foods c ould be consumed throughout the year, it allowed po pulations to remain in place, despite changes in weather and eve n times of crop failure. That’s the theory that I w as taught and accepted. But suppose that there was another “hidde n” reason that the first farmers chose grains, bean s, and milk. Whenever I get into an argument about the benefits of exercise with a long-distance runner, I point ou t that, by definition, the most successful animal is the one t hat finds the most calories for the least amount of effort. That is the genetic definition of success. But the corollar y that was staring me in the face was this: The mos t successful animal is the one that stores the most amount of fa t from any available calorie. Perhaps we had gotten it all wrong. Maybe our ancient ancestors didn’t opt for grains, beans, and milk because they could be stored. Suppo se if, instead, it was because they discovered that this trio of fo ods had the unique ability to literally turbocharge fat storage for"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"it was because they discovered that this trio of fo ods had the unique ability to literally turbocharge fat storage for any given calorie, relative to any other foods? SUCCESS STORY Good-bye to Diabetes and Thirty Pounds I see a lot of Hispanic patients, and they often sh are the same confluence of health problems as my ot her patients. They, too, have diabetes, autoimmune issu es, and excess weight, in this case in large part attributable to the replacement of their ancestral diet with modern substitutes, and with moving from an agricultural society to an urban lifestyle. Maria S . is representative of many such patients. She was forty- seven years old and had severe diabetes and was on insulin injections when I first saw her, with an Hb A1C (a marker of diabetes) at 7.9—when the upper limit of normal is 5.6. Within a year, Maria had cut her pos itive markers for autoimmune disease in half. Her HbA1c i s now 5.9, approaching normal. Her fasting blood su gar level has dropped from 146 to 109 and she is now of f all medications, including insulin. As a bonus, M aria has lost thirty pounds. The wonderful thing is that although she speaks no English, she was able to fo llow the Plant Paradox Program, thanks to her children actin g as translators. The Best Way to Fatten Up IF I’VE HEARD it once, I’ve heard it ten thousand times from my patients: “Whole grains and beans are key to a healthy diet.” But I am here to tell you that the e vidence with animals is exactly the opposite. I gre w up in the 1950s and 1960s in Omaha, Nebraska, which at that time bo asted the world’s largest stockyard. In our stockya rds, as any Cornhusker knows, we fattened our beef on corn! Why truck cows from all over the midwest to Omaha to f atten them on corn? Because cows don’t get fat eating hay and grass—every farmer knows that. As early as the nineteenth century, pigs raised in the Ohio River V alley were fattened with corn before being herded t o slaughterhouses in Cincinnati. The farmer could mak e more money walking corn-fattened pigs to market t han putting the corn on barges to send to pig farms. Th e popular expression of the day was that you drove your corn to market in a pig. This may surprise you, but a pig is not normally a fat animal. Wild boars and feral pigs are lean, sle ek, muscular animals. You Arkansas Razorback fans know what I me an. But you may not know that a pig has the identic al digestive system and cardiovascular system to a hum an, which is why I use pig valves to replace defect ive human valves. Think about that next time you are accused of eating like a pig! And as with pigs, eating corn fattens up us humans. A number of my patients seek my treatment for weigh t loss, but at least half of them see me for the re lief of autoimmune diseases. Many of those folks are of nor mal weight. As I mentioned earlier, one of the happ y side effects of my program is returning to a normal weig ht, regardless of the patient’s original reason for seeing me. But over the years I’ve had a small group of patients w ho, once they make the food changes that I ask for to cure their autoimmune disease, keep losing weight and can’t ke ep it on. Early in my new career, I asked them to e at more fat, particularly avocados, but that didn’t help. As the years passed, patient after skinny patient would r eturn three or four months later carrying some additional pounds. Invariably, they had added bread, pasta, corn, or b eans to their diet. Yes, when all else failed to restore their lo st weight, grains and beans did the job. But to eve ryone’s chagrin, it also elevated the markers of inflammation in their blood. My more recent and effective solution to thi s problem is to have them eat large amounts of macadamia nuts. There it was again, the plant paradox in action: th e very foods that promoted our ancestors’ ability t o gain weight and survive a harsh winter, making them more likely to produce a new genetic copy (aka a baby), were t he same ones that would hasten their eventual demise—and ou rs. If you’ve read my first book, then you know tha t our genes will always choose this route: maximize calories fr om food in order to reproduce, then assure the dest ruction of the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"will always choose this route: maximize calories fr om food in order to reproduce, then assure the dest ruction of the parent after the child is grown so that there is su fficient food for that child or grandchild. Here, then, is the reason grains and beans took ove r the world. It wasn’t because they were “healthy.” It wasn’t because they could be stored. No, it was merely bec ause such foods promoted greater fat deposits per c alorie than any other food source. That was good then, but it c ertainly isn’t now. Nor is the fact that such a die t also does a better job of shortening the postreproductive years . You’ll recall that it isn’t just grains and beans t hat turbocharge fat storage, but also milk products . Lactating animals use milk for one thing: to promote rapid growth and weight gain in their offspring. All milk is loaded with insulinlike growth hormone. Sadly, multiple studies show that another component of milk, casein, and i n particular casein A-1, becomes the lectin beta-casomorphin, wh ich encourages fat storage by promoting inflammatio n. Remember, inflammation indicates a state of war, an d the war effort requires fuel for the troops, stim ulating the storage of more fat for fuel. Unbelievable but True: The Power of Poop If you take feces from obese rats and feed it to sk inny rats, presto change-o, the skinny rats become fat! The reverse is also true: a skinny rat’s poop makes fat rats thin. Yes, you are interpreting that correctl y: the organisms in your intestines control how skinny or fat you will be. Recent studies have shown that fec es from fat humans given to skinny rats will make them fat; it works even better if you throw in some “fertilizer” in the form of sugars and fats! Still not impressed? Consider this: In the 1930s, institu tionalized patients with severe depression were given laxative s to clean out their colon, and then given fecal en emas from happy people. You guessed it: the depressed in dividuals became happy. As a student at the Medical College of Georgia in t he 1970s, I witnessed cure after cure of a severe i nfection of the colon called Clostridium difficile colitis, which had occurred in patients given newl y introduced broad- spectrum antibiotics. Again, the method was to give patients fecal enemas, in this case made with the poop of healthy medical students. In fact, once a week, the “honey pot” was passed around to all of us medical students to make a deposit, in order to have fresh poop available to treat this horrible disease. Litt le did we know then that the antibiotics had disturbed the in testines of these patients, and that the microbes i n our feces restored them to health. The Lectin Link to Obesity and Ill Health I HAVE ALREADY introduced you to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and explained that it is implicated in celiac disease and also bears a striking resemblance to th e hormone insulin. Now let’s take an in-depth look at the actions of insulin and problematic effects that occur when WGA mimics insulin. Normally, when sugar enters the bloodstream from ou r gut, the pancreas secretes insulin into the blood stream, and the insulin then travels to three main places: fat cells, muscle cells, and neurons. Insulin’s primary job is to open the door to any cell to allow glucose to enter and prov ide fuel, particularly to three important types of cells. 1. IN FAT CELLS , insulin attaches to a docking port on a fat cell membrane and flips a switch that tells the fat cell to convert that glucose to fat and sto re it. When insulin has done its job, it separates from the docking port and no more sugar can enter the cell. 2. IN MUSCLE CELLS , insulin unlocks the door to the cell and ushers i n glucose to be used as fuel. 3. NERVE CELLS (neurons) also require insulin to admit glucose th rough their cell membrane. The fact that neurons require insulin to get glucose is a re latively new finding, and we now know that insulin resistance also occurs in the brain and nerves—it i s called type 3 diabetes."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Once insulin docks in the appropriate ports and rel eases information, the fat, muscle, or nerve cells tell the hormone that the message has been received. The hormone the n backs out of the docking port, leaving it ready a nd available for the next hormone to attach. Problems arise when lectins mimic insulin and bind to those docking ports on cell walls instead. The l ectins either give the wrong information or block the release of the correct information. To understand the conseque nces, imagine that you are a passenger on a plane after a long flight, and another plane is still sitting at your Jetway at the terminal. You can’t get off the plane (release your information) until that plane moves. But suppose i t never moves! Now what? As long as lectins occupy the “Jetway,” t he proper messaging is interrupted or silenced—inde finitely. Now let’s look at what happens when the lectin WGA fits into each type of insulin receptor docking por t: 1. In the case of a fat cell membrane, WGA lock s on for good and continues to instruct the cell to make fat from any sugar floating by—ad infinitum. Think abou t it: if you were living eight thousand years ago, any plant compound that could enhance your ability to s tore fat from the meager calories you obtained woul d be a great plant. But that’s no longer a great benefit —and lectins such as WGA and a host of others in ev ery grain do far more just to potentiate fat storage di rectly into fat cells. 2. If WGA attaches to a muscle cell, it likewis e permanently locks on to that insulin receptor—but in this case, the opposite effect results. WGA blocks the r eal insulin from docking, just as another plane sit ting at your arrival gate means you cannot deplane. The res ult is that the muscle can’t get glucose; instead, it is shunted to a waiting fat cell, where WGA continuous ly pumps in sugar. Would it surprise you to learn t hat early man was far more muscular before the advent o f grains and beans? Take a look at any ancient Egyp tian frescoes and statues: these were skinny, nonmuscula r people. As it turns out, insulin mimicry is the t rue cause of the muscle wasting as we age! The more lec tins we eat, the more the receptors for insulin on our muscles are filled with WGA and other lectins, and the more muscle we waste. 3. When WGA and other lectins lock on to the in sulin receptor in nerve cells and neurons, they blo ck the entrance of sugar there as well. With no sugar reac hing its neurons, the hungry brain demands more cal ories. If you block insulin receptors with WGA, you get a hungry human—one who will eat more and hopefully be a big winner when winter arrives. This may have bee n fine in the short term, promoting mankind’s early survival; but if this process continues, more WGA a nd other lectins bind to insulin receptors in the b rain and nerves, causing brain cells and peripheral nerves t o die, resulting in dementia, Parkinson’s, and peri pheral neuropathy. The cumulative result is less muscle mass, starved brain and nerve cells, and plenty of fat. Sound fam iliar? Recently, it has been found that lectins climb the vagus nerve from the gut into the brain and can be deposited in the substantia nigra, 3 the switching center in the brain, damage to which causes Parkinson’s disease. This explains why, according to a large Chinese study, patients who ha ve had a procedure called a vagotomy back in the 19 60s and 1970s (in which their vagus nerves were surgically cut to treat ulcers) have a 40 percent lower incide nce of Parkinson’s compared to age-matched controls. 4 Lectins weren’t reaching the brain as readily, and therefore weren’t able to cause as much harm. It also explain s why Parkinson’s is more prevalent among vegetaria ns, as they consume more plants (and therefore more lectins). R emember, the plant is just doing its job: ridding t he world of unwanted pests, including you! To summarize, in ancient times when food was scarce , weight gain from consuming the lectins in grains and beans was a huge benefit, but today, the same result work s against us. Now let’s move to the second way lect ins work for us and against us. Preparing for War I MENTIONED ABOVE that my patients who needed to replace lost weight had resorted to grain- and bean-based"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I MENTIONED ABOVE that my patients who needed to replace lost weight had resorted to grain- and bean-based foods, but in doing so, most of them found that the ir inflammation markers had begun to rise. Was infl ammation also promoting their weight gain? Remember, LPSs an d lectins act like foreign invaders, which cause TL Rs to alert the body that it is under attack and to go into “wa r mode.” During a war, the troops must be well nour ished in order to fight the enemy, so food is often rationed for n oncombatants. White blood cells and the immune syst em serve as the troops, while the muscles represent the civilia ns at home. By making muscles and the brain resista nt to the effects of both insulin and leptin (the hormone tha t makes you feel full), calories are shunted away f rom the muscles and the brain, ensuring there are sufficient calori es to fuel the white blood cells on the battlefront . Moreover, if there is a war going on, your body sends signals to encourage you to find more calories for the war ef fort. The more lectins you ingest from grains and beans, the hungr ier you are. This is a key point: You are insulin- and leptin-re sistant not because you are overweight; rather, you are overweight because your body is at war and is saving calories for the war effort. This is the complete opposite o f the common wisdom of why we bulk up. However, if the body sens es that there is no war because no lectins and no L PSs are getting into the body, there is no reason to hoard calories, by either conserving food or seeking more food. Weight loss is a “side effect” of ending the war. No wonde r almost everyone was slim fifty years ago, back wh en our bodies weren’t constantly at war! Fat Storage YOU’VE PROBABLY BEEN told that if you store fat around your midsection, it is the dangerous fat pattern known as apple-shaped, but if you store fat on your buttocks or hips, what is called pear-shaped, you are okay. There is a lot of truth to this finding. To underst and why fat is stored in the gut, let’s return to o ur war analogy. The troops need fuel and it needs to be near the front lines, where the troops are battling the lectins an d LPSs. And where is the war? Right, it is at the wall of your intestines, in your gut, where lectins and LPSs hav e broken across the border. Fat is not the culprit; rather, it is a sign of the battle being waged in your belly. It’s not called “belly fat” for nothing. As a heart surgeon, I have known for years that whe n I open up a patient to do a coronary artery bypas s I will find a large amount of fat surrounding these arteries on t he surface of the heart. That fat is really thick a nd hard, and it’s there even if you are skinny. If there is a lot of fat, I know that a war is being waged nearby and th at the call for supplies is constant. The war is in your arteries, and I am doing a bypass because you lost the war. I n fact, multiple studies show that pericardial fat (fat on the arter ies) directly correlates with the amount of disease inside the blood vessels. 5 What are the implications? Wherever we find excess fat, that means there is a war being waged. Fat in your gut signifies not only that there is a war goi ng on in your intestines, but that sadly it is spre ading to your heart and brain, much like terrorist sleeper cells. SUCCESS STORIES An Alternative to Surgery Surgery or a different diet—that’s the choice I giv e many of my patients. Although I am a heart surgeo n, if the patient is a good candidate for my dietary appr oach and indicates interest in this alternative, I always discuss the Plant Paradox Program with him or her. As long as someone adheres to the diet, the results are remarkable. Offering patients this option has earne d me the nickname No More Mr. Knife Guy! Here are j ust a few of the many people who have avoided major sur gery with simple lifestyle choices. BLOCKED NO LONGER. When Vincent P., a sixty-seven-year-old theatrical producer, developed chest pain while exercising, an angiogram showed a narrow lesion in his right coronary artery, which had bee n previously treated by implanting a stent. His cardi ologist referred him to me for dietary treatment of several other arterial lesions, which were 60 percent block ed and not eligible for stents (but still of concer n). After"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"other arterial lesions, which were 60 percent block ed and not eligible for stents (but still of concer n). After following the Plant Paradox Program for ten months, Vincent had another angiogram, which showed that a ll of the remained blockages had been resolved, making surgery or other stents unnecessary. Six years lat er, Vincent takes no medication, routinely passes his s tress tests, and recently opened an off-Broadway sh ow. A PROMISE KEPT. Sonja R., a fifty-eight-year-old farmer and severe diabetic, was scheduled for an emergency triple bypass after having a heart attack . Five of her arteries had severe blockages. In the pre-op room, she asked whether any other option was possib le. After I told her about my dietary approach, she said she would be my best patient if I would not operate on her. She kept her promise: three years later sh e has lost forty pounds, is no longer a diabetic, takes n o medications, has no chest pain, and has a normal response to my cardiac stress tests. Sonja now raises pastur ed chickens and goats, makes goat yogurt, and hauls wheelbarrows of manure and soil daily. GOODBYE TO DIABETES. At sixty-nine, Howard L. was obese and took eight medications daily for diabetes and other conditions. He had suffered a he art attack and was scheduled for an emergency five- vessel bypass surgery. In the pre-op room, I could tell th at he was extremely anxious. After we spoke for a w hile, Howard told me he didn’t think he was going to make it through surgery and asked whether there was another option. When I offered him my diet, he jump ed at the chance. Now, five years later, his diabet es and chest pain are history, he takes no medications, he has lost thirty pounds, and he regularly passes hi s annual stress tests. An Abundance of “Successful” Diets WHY ARE THERE so many diets? And why do so many of them work (at least temporarily)? Do they have anything in common? Step back and tick off a few of the most successful and popular diet philosophies of recent years: low-carb, high-protein (Atkins, Protein Powe r, South Beach, and Dukan, to name a few); low-carb , high-fat, high-protein (Paleo, ketogenic-Paleo); low-fat, hig h-carb (Ornish, McDougall, Fuhrman, Esselstyn). Eac h of these approaches can lay claim to immense success among i ts followers. Alan Levinovitz, Ph.D., recently paro died the popularity and success of these totally different d iets in The Gluten Lie and Other Myths About What You Eat. The book presents a fictional UnPacked diet, which is b ased on eliminating plastic wrappers (I kid you not ). He cites websites to visit, pretends to sell products, and p rovides testimonials from patients. After you avidl y read the multiple arguments Levinovitz makes in support of h is program, you are suddenly confronted with the fa ct that he carefully cherry-picked his data, used other diet g urus’ own words, and stole testimonials from most o f the wildly different programs listed above about the great res ults. The joke is seemingly on us. (But what Levino vitz misses is the fact that all the data he quotes about the dang ers of plastics are actually true, as you learned i n the last chapter.) I have had the privilege of treating a number of pa tients who were firm adopters of each of the above- mentioned programs. They may have controlled their weight, ye t they continued to have troubling medical issues, including advancing coronary artery disease and autoimmune di sease, to name just two. Let’s dig deeper into what really happens on these diet programs. The Problem with Most Low-Carb Diets A LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIET —think Atkins or South Beach—often works well in th e short term. Heck, it worked well for me initially. However, if and when you return to eating significant amounts of lectin- containing carbohydrates, those lost pounds usually make a com eback. Even if you stick with the program, your wei ght loss typically stops or slows significantly at a certain point. All low-carb plans are inherently high-prot ein diets, and thus restrict carbohydrates, all grains, and legumes—and with them, their lectin load. When the South Beach and Atkins diets reintroduce grains and beans in the maintenan ce phase, and people invariably start to gain weigh t, what is suggested? You guessed it: go back to the first pha se and cut out grains and beans! The Paleo concept takes the high-protein diet a ste p further and is based on the faulty assumption tha t early man"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Paleo concept takes the high-protein diet a ste p further and is based on the faulty assumption tha t early man dined on buffalo and other large animals on a regul ar basis and that’s what made us healthy. In all li kelihood, such kills were hardly a regular occurrence. Instead, ou r forefathers likely subsisted mostly on tubers, be rries, nuts, and animal protein sources such as fish, lizards, snail s, insects, and small rodents. Now, don’t get me wr ong—our “ancestral diet” was designed to do what any diet d oes: ensure that you grow up, reproduce, and then g et out of the way. Your genes designed the ancestral diet to make you an ancestor, if you get my drift. Enabling you to live long is counterproductive to maximizing the number of hu mans being born, just as making cars that last fore ver is counterproductive for the automobile industry. I ha te to break it to you, but any success you may have experienced on the Paleo diet or another low-carb plan, whether as weight loss or improved health, was not the result of restricting carbohydrates and eating lots of protei n and fat. Rather, any positive response was the re sult of—guess what?—eliminating most lectin-containing foods. Don ’t forget that the Paleo concept is defined by what our Stone Age ancestors supposedly ate 100,000 years ago. Finally, my Paleo colleagues somehow don’t realize that all our ancestors were originally from Africa and never encountered any lectin-containing food from the Ame ricas. Sorry, folks, but tomatoes, zucchini “noodle s,” bell peppers, goji berries, peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, and chia or pumpkin seeds are not ancestral foods—and they are loaded with lectins. Another Approach to Restricting Carbs A KETOGENIC DIET , which is traditionally prescribed to help people, including children, with diabetes moderate their blood sugar and insulin levels, is a lso a low-carbohydrate diet—but with a significant difference. Instead of replacing most carbohydrates with protei n, a true ketogenic diet also limits protein, relyi ng instead on certain fats for the majority of calories. (Ketosis refers to burning fat rather than glucose from car bohydrates for energy.) If you limit certain animal protein intake , as the Plant Paradox Program does, you will almos t certainly lose weight. And when I limit it even more with a m odified ketogenic version of the Plant Paradox Prog ram, I see remarkable success not only with patients with diab etes (or who are extremely insulin-resistant) but a lso with those suffering from cancer, dementia, Parkinson’s diseas e, autoimmune disease, and a number of gut diseases . (Chapter 10 addresses this modification.) The question is: a re most people on a ketogenic diet in ketosis, and is that why they are losing weight? The answer from my patients’ lab oratory assessments is a resounding no! So, why the weight loss? Once more, removal of the vast majority of le ctins from their diet, not the addition of fat, mad e the difference. Hold the Fat and Push the Whole Grains DO PEOPLE LOSE weight on low-fat, whole-grain diets such as those from Ornish, Esselstyn, and T. Colin Campbell ( The China Study )? Indeed they do. I’ve seen a lot of them as patie nts because although they did lose weight, these diets failed to halt the progression of their coronary artery disease. But why the weigh t loss? I think it is the result of four factors: 1. They remove the lectin-containing fats so pr evalent in our American diet, namely soy, peanut, cottonseed, sunflower, and canola—all of which not only contain lectins but are also extremely high in polyunsaturated omega-6 fats, which are used by our TLRs to incite the inflammatory cascade. Inflammat ion equals war equals store fat near the war zone—in th e coronary arteries. 2. Because they have eliminated fats, low-fat d iets do not allow LPSs, which have to travel on lon g-chain saturated fatty acids to sneak through the gut wall , where they would cause inflammation. That is a go od thing, but the well-meaning physicians who had once demonized all fat and championed low-fat diets hav e come to realize that all fat is not the same. Fish oil is now an integral part of Dr. Dean Ornish’s pr ogram, and Dr. Joel Fuhrman has made fatty nuts an important p art of his diet. 6 Luckily, neither of these regimens allows lectins to cross the gut barrier, so they are “safe .”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"3. They use whole unprocessed grains, not groun d-up “whole grains.” Now, I feel a little like Mark Antony here, when he said, “I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.” So why am I defending whole grains? Fi rst, most whole-grain “foods” are not actually whole gra ins, but are ground-up versions. Do you ever actual ly see a lot of “whole grains” in that piece of bread or c racker? Their lectins have already been released, a nd, as a double whammy, their fats are treated with BHT to p revent oxidation. 4. These physicians have correctly focused on o rganic grains, which are far more likely to be unto uched by Roundup and the resulting death of the normal gut b ugs. As a result, the diets enable the gut to handl e gluten and prevent gang members from moving into the void created by that herbicide. And then there’s this sad fact: these diets are gen erally intolerable, so you don’t eat much. Even the Kellogg brothers couldn’t get their sanatorium guests to ea t whole grains, hence the birth of Kellogg’s cornfl akes (ground-up grains). A review of Dr. Esselstyn’s original study shows a 50 percent dropout rate. It’s not a diet y ou can live with, so any positive results in terms of weight loss may be short lived. Why have the followers of these programs who became my patients found that their coronary artery disea se had progressed? The WGA in wheat continued to bind to t he endothelial lining of their coronary arteries, w hich their immune system attacked. If you ever wondered why th e southern Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans (all of w hose staple grain is rice) have lower heart disease rate s than Americans, remember this: rice contains no W GA. Nor does the taro root the Kitavans eat in abundance. Likewi se, the millet, sorghum, and yams that are African staples contain no WGA. What We Share with Elephants WANT ONE MORE shocker about grasses and grains? In the wild, whe re they dine only on the leaves of trees (like our forebears), African elephants have no kno wn coronary artery disease. Due to habitat destruct ion, however, herds of elephants now graze on grasslands or are f ed hay and grains. These animals have a 50 percent rate of severe coronary artery disease, thanks to the lecti ns they were never designed to eat, which bind to t heir arteries and incite an attack. It is now time to reveal which sugar molecule the W GA and other lectins are after. As it turns out, th ere’s a particular sugar molecule that elephants—and humans —possess that causes this problem. This lectin-bind ing sugar, called Neu5Ac, sits on the lining of blood vessels and the absorptive cells on the gut wall known as e nterocytes. Most mammals have a sugar molecule called Neu5Gc on the lining of their gut wall and blood vessel wall s. But humans lost the ability to make this molecule at th e time our species diverged from chimps and gorilla s eight million years ago. Instead, we make the lectin-bind ing Neu5Ac, a characteristic shared with shellfish, mollusks, chickens, and elephants. (Yes, strange bedfellows!) Lectins, and particularly grain lectins, bind to N eu5Ac but cannot bind to Neu5Gc. This explains why captive ch imps eating a human grain-based diet don’t get athe rosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or autoimmune disease, but the poor grass-eating elephants do get coronary artery disease. The chimps lack the lectin-binding sugar m olecule, but elephants and humans possess it—and it gives us heart and autoimmune diseases in spades when we eat lectins in grasses and seeds. The Anti-Aging Approach REMEMBER, YOUR GOAL is to eat a life-enhancing diet, not just one that will help you shed excess pounds and keep them off. A serious problem with any low-c arb or “ancestral” dietary approach is that consumi ng significant amounts of certain animal protein, part icularly red meats, is known to be a major trigger of aging, as well as of atherosclerosis and cancer. How so? Back to our old friend Neu5Ac. Stay with me, as it gets more complex before I can simplify it. Cattle, pigs, and sheep all carry Neu5Gc, which your immune system re cognizes as foreign when you eat their meat. Now, N eu5Gc"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"sheep all carry Neu5Gc, which your immune system re cognizes as foreign when you eat their meat. Now, N eu5Gc looks a lot like Neu5Ac (the bar codes are nearly i dentical). There is significant data suggesting tha t when our immune system is exposed to the foreign sugar molec ule Neu5Gc from red meat, we develop an antibody to the lining of our own blood vessels, which has Neu5Ac. This causes the antibody to attach to the lining of our blood vessels, mistaking our own naturally occurring Neu5 Ac for the Neu5Gc we’ve consumed, and calling in a full- fledged attack from our immune system. This is the perfect example of friendly fire, and i t provides further proof why shellfish, mollusk, an d fish eaters have better heart health than meat eaters. Furthermore, it has been shown that cancer cells use Neu5Gc to a ttract blood vessel growth toward them, via production of a horm one called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF ), which I measure in all my patients. VEGF production is prom oted by an immune attack on Neu5Gc. Cancer cells ev en use Neu5Gc to hide from our immune cells, essentially c loaking themselves in an invisible shield. What’s m ore, human tumors contain large amounts of Neu5Gc, despite the fact that we have no genes to manufacture it. That means the tumor cells got it from that beef, pork, or lamb yo u ate, and nowhere else. In plain English, the reason to avoid red meats is to avoid an autoimmune attack that promotes heart d isease and cancer, all because of a genetic mutation of a lect in-attracting sugar molecule that’s found in humans . A diet low in any animal protein has been shown to extend life, as will be discussed in chapter 9. So, a certain amount of animal protein is the actual mischief mak er when it comes to longevity. This means certain c arbs (those without lectins, or with lectins with which your mi crobes have been familiar for millennia) are not as problematic as the Atkins and Paleo folks have taught you, as long as you minimize certain animal proteins. And hastening the aging process is not the only res ult of eating excessive amounts of protein. Remembe r, eating simple sugars increases production of insulin, the fat storage hormone, just as eating fat boosts the level of leptin, the hormone that signals your brain when you are fu ll. But you may not know that when you consume suga rs along with certain proteins more prevalent in animals tha n plants, they stimulate cells’ ultimate aging rece ptor, which senses energy availability. We will discuss this ag ing receptor in chapter 9. Energy—think food—is usually available cyclically, based on the circadian rhythms of seasons and dayli ght. If energy is plentiful, then it is time to grow and ma ke things, meaning babies. When energy is scarce, i t is time to batten down the hatches, get rid of hangers-on, and wait things out. During scarce times we use the fa t we stored; meanwhile, our mitochondria switch from sugar (gluc ose) burning to fat burning, in what is called meta bolic flexibility. Most of my patients with multiple dise ases have lost all metabolic flexibility. This mean s that a diet high in both sugars and protein encourages weight gain a nd makes a person more susceptible to disease—and t herefore could and indeed does reduce life span, but also he alth span and life enhancement. Here’s another paradox for you: Your genes want you to reproduce and replace yourself. Once that happe ns, your genes couldn’t care less how long you live—okay, yo u do need enough time to get your offspring to the point where they are able to survive on their own—and the n they do everything they can to get out of the way . That middle-age spread is a perfect example of what I am taking about. We are supposed to die off once we r eplace ourselves. But if we want to live as long and as he althy a life as possible, we need to eat differentl y. A Paleo Diet That Endures LET’S RETURN TO my previous conundrum, the Kitavans, a small tribe of farmers who inhabit an equally small island in Papua New Guinea. According to Swedish ph ysician Staffan Lindeberg, who has been studying th e tribe’s diet for decades, the Kitavans obtain 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 30 percent from fat (most of it saturated fat), and only 10 percent from protein. M ost of the islanders smoke, they are not very activ e, but they live well into their nineties without medical care. Thei r diet seems to contradict most of the conventional assumptions about what constitutes a healthy diet, and yet the tribe seems untouched by most of the diseases of mo dern man. Lindeberg’s study, in which he matched 220 Kitavans with as many Swedish subjects of the same age and gender, provided provocative results. 7 Kitavan men age twenty and older had a lower body m ass index (BMI), lower blood pressure, and lower total LDL (“bad”) cholesterol t han those of comparable Swedish men. Both groups di splayed"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"pressure, and lower total LDL (“bad”) cholesterol t han those of comparable Swedish men. Both groups di splayed similar HDL (“good”) cholesterol readings. Kitavan women over the age of sixty had lower levels of APo B (apolipopoprotein B), a marker for LDL cholesterol associated with heart and vascular disease, than th eir Swedish counterparts. Furthermore, Kitavans never experienc e strokes or heart attacks. When Is a Carb Not a Carb? SO HOW DO the Kitavans stay slim and avoid heart attacks, de spite eating mostly carbohydrates and a large amount of primarily saturated fats, both of which a re considered a recipe for obesity (and heart disea se, in the case of the fats) in the West? The answer lies in the fa ct that the carbohydrates the Kitavans consume are primarily resistant starches, which give you a free (well, al most free) pass when it comes to their caloric cont ent. If that sounds too good to be true, welcome to the world of resistant starches. This subset of starches behave s differently in your GI tract than do corn, rice, wheat, and other typical starches or simple sugars. Instead of being quickly converted to glucose (blood sugar), which is burned for energy or stored as fat, yams, taro, plantains , and other resistant starches simply pass through your small i ntestine intact. These foods are resistant to the e nzymes that break complex starches—hence their name. That means you don’t absorb the calories as sugar, which would prompt an insulin surge—but what is eve n better is that these starches are just what the doctor ordere d for your gut microbes, which happily devour resis tant starches and grow, meanwhile converting them to short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyra te (the colon’s preferred fuel, as well as a perfect fuel f or neurons). Resistant starches also increase the p roportion of “good” bacteria in your gut, just as a prebiotic do es, not only enhancing digestion and nutrient absor ption but also fostering the growth of bugs that nurture the mucou s layer of your gut. 8 More mucus means fewer lectins getting through to rip open the tight junctions and start t he whole lectin-induced cycle of weight gain and mi sery. 9 In addition to not raising blood sugar or insulin l evels, resistant starch assists in controlling your weight by: • Reducing calorie count when substituted for whe at flour and other quickly metabolized carbohydrate s. 10 • Making you feel full longer and therefore consu me less food. 11 • Boosting fat burning and reducing fat storage a fter a meal. 12 You need not live on an island and eat taro day in and day out to get the benefits of resistant starch . In Part II, I’ll introduce you to more sources of the microbe-friend ly food and explain how to prepare them to maximize their benefits. How Leaves Become a High-Fat Diet! A gorilla is a classic herbivore, subsisting primar ily on leaves. (Yes, they do occasionally inadverte ntly scarf down an insect or three on the leaves.) Surprisingl y, a gorilla eats sixteen pounds of “fat-free” leav es a day, but 60 to 70 percent of the calories the animal abs orbs after digestion is in the form of fats! How ca n that be? Well, the gut microbes, good little guest workers t hat they are, break down the cell walls of plants a nd ferment the energy into usable fuel, principally th e fats we just discussed, which the animal can abso rb. As a result, the gorilla “eats” an extremely high-fat di et! Just like the Kitavans! Other Long-ived Thin Peoples I SHOULD MENTION that with the rise of globalization, traditional d iets are increasingly giving way to the SAD, or perhaps more appropriately, what is now the typi cal Western diet.

Although their diets"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"longevity and good health. Okinawans, Cretans, and Sardinians are known for their longevity. Although their diets differ, both also consume foods that feed gut bacte ria. If you carefully examine the diets of long-liv ed societies, including the Seventh-day Adventists of Loma Linda, California, where I was a professor for years, a r emarkable pattern emerges from seemingly disparate diets. The Okinowans and the Kitavans eat a diet very high in resistant starches, from a purple sweet potato and taro root, respectively; the Cretans and Sardinians eat a ver y high-fat (olive oil) diet, while the Adventists eat a diet composed of 60 percent fat, despite being vegetarians. What could possibly be the common thread? It’s the minimal intake of animal protein. Most of these lon g-lived cultures get most of their calories from sources ot her than protein. And even the high “carb” eaters, like the Kitavans and the Okinowans, turn their resistant st arches into usable fat, courtesy of their gut bugs. We’ll revisit these long-lived societies in Part II. Blame Pizza and Chicken for Fat Kids IT’S OBVIOUS THAT the American diet has changed dramatically in the last century. In that same time, and particularly in the last fifty years, we (and our c hildren) have become significantly heavier. For her 2009 doctoral dissertation in the urban studies and public affair s program at the University of Akron, Lisaann Schel li Gittner explored the connection between the changes in the American diet and the rise in childhood obesity. 13 Her thesis, entitled From Farm to Fat Kids, explored one of the unintended consequences of gov ernment agricultural policies, which significantly changed the food supply. This c reated a niche for inexpensive processed and refine d foods, and their increasing use correlated with the growing in cidence of obese kids. Beginning in the 1960s, the intensive planting of crops such as corn, wheat, sugar beets, canola (rapeseed), and soybeans made for a very di fferent supply of plant food than was available around 1900. This shift in crops led to a change in diet from grass-f ed meats and their fats (butter and lard), chickens that ate bug s, lots of root vegetables, and very limited amount s of fruit to one high in polyunsaturated fats, sugar, massive amount s of fruit products like apple juice, and other pro cessed foods, and one low in vegetables. The increase in BMI of c hildren over these years mirrored these changing pa tterns in food consumption. But despite all this, only two foods correlated per fectly with rising obesity rates in kids. Not surpr isingly, they were pizza and chicken. In the 1970s, kids started eatin g lots of both these foods. Just check out the lunc h menu in any public school. The more pizza and chicken kids cons umed per year, the higher their average BMI. Althou gh Gittner’s focus was public affairs, not lectins, bo th of these foods are lectin bombs. The typical piz za contains at least three ingredients full of them: wheat, cheese full of casein A-1 and insulinlike growth factor, and tomato sauce. How about the chicken? Unlike its forebears, which foraged in the barnyard for grubs and insects, toda y’s typical hen spends its brief life eating soy and corn, and laced with the estrogenlike compounds arsenic and p hthalates. Dip this chicken in wheat flour breading mix and deep-f ry it in peanut or soybean oil and you have a perfe ct lectin and estrogen bomb. Eat these two foods on a regular bas is and your lectin load grows—and with it, your wei ght almost certainly will as well. You now have a thorough understanding of how we got into this intertwined health crisis, thanks to sub tle changes in your foods, personal care products, lighting, an d a host of new drugs, and why your excess weight a nd health problems really aren’t your fault. Now it’s time to take back your body and your life. As I tell my pa tients, your body is the only home you will ever live in. If you spend the same effort on this home that you spend on your house or apartment or car, the dividends will last a long , vibrant lifetime. Let’s move on to Part II, where I’ll supply you with the tools and guidance you’ll need to achieve a healthy weight, along with vibrant health."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"————— PART II ————— Introducing the Plant Paradox Program —————————————"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"6 Revamp Your Habits Okay, this is what you have been waiting for. Now t hat you know the science behind the Plant Paradox P rogram and what it has done for countless others, it’s tim e to jump in and take control of your health by fin ding out what it can do for you. But before you get started, I want you to commit t o memory the four rules that govern the program, along with the following statement, which is the mo st important thing I have to say in all of Part II: Every time you waver, every time you rationalize something about w hat you plan to eat, every time you hear a little v oice in your head saying, “But this is healthy food,” stop and r eturn immediately to Rule Number 1 (below). Let me tell you what I have learned from every pati ent I have cared for over the past sixteen years as director of the Center for Restorative Medicine, which informs Rule Number 1: what you stop eating is more important t han what you start eating. My patient Tony, whose vitiligo w as cured after he started the program, is a perfect example. When the pigment in his skin returned, I could have said that his skin miraculously normalized because my d ietary program was extremely anti-inflammatory, high in an tioxidants, low in simple carbs, high in olive oil, and blah, blah, blah. The creators of all diets make these ki nds of proclamations. But quite frankly, most of th is rationale about why a dietary program works is wrong. Why? Be cause it wasn’t what I told Tony to eat that made t he big difference in his health; rather, it was what I tol d him not to eat that cured him. Follow the Rules THESE FOUR SIMPLE rules will enable you to experience success on the Plant Paradox Program. RULE NUMBER 1: What You Stop Eating Has Far More Impact on Your Health Than Wha t You Start Eating As far as I know, Professor John Soothill of Great Ormond Street in London, my old hospital, was the f irst person to state this rule. If you get no further than this ru le, and if you actually follow the Plant Paradox fo od lists, I can virtually guarantee that you will achieve remarkabl y good and sustainable health. Now, I’m not suggest ing that you simply stop eating, although the ability of a simpl e water fast to cure any number of diseases is stag gering. 1 But this rule does confirm Hippocrates’s dictum that “all di sease begins in the gut.” If you stop damaging your gut, you’ll be healthier overall. Your gut holobiome accounts for 90 percent of the cells that make you “you” and con tains 99 percent of all the genetic material that makes you “you”—so what goes on in your gut, unlike Las Vegas , doesn’t stay in your gut. Which brings us to my second rule . RULE NUMBER 2: Pay Attention to the Care and Feeding of Your Gut Bugs, and They Will Handle the Care and Feeding of You. After All, You Are Their Home. Another way of expressing this rule is: Give your g ut bugs what they want, and nobody gets hurt. That sounds pretty easy, except for one thing. Part I should ha ve convinced you by now that most of us have a virt ual wasteland inside our gut. Years of using antibiotics, antacid s, and NSAIDs, plus the high-fat, high-sugar Wester n diet, have decimated the once-dense “rain forest” of our gut. A “food desert” is an area where quality food is un available, even if people want to eat it. Imagine your gut as a vas t, almost uninhabitable food desert, where only the bad bugs can survive and actually thrive on the stuff you throw down to them. Remember Audrey II, the carnivorous p lant in Little Shop of Horrors , who was always screaming, “Feed me, Seymour. Feed me!”? Similarly, the bad bugs are demanding more sugar, refined carbs, and saturated fat—in other words, junk food. That’s exactly what the bad bugs love to dine on, which takes us back to Rule N umber 1.

SUCCESS STORY Every Little Bit Counts Twenty-three-year-old Lydia B. had a persistent cou gh and sore throat, which her well-meaning doctor w as treating with round after round of broad-spectrum a ntibiotics. She developed a rash, which her doctor called an “antibiotic drug rash.” When it failed to clear up, he sent her to a rheumatologist, who diagnosed her with lupus and started her on high doses of steroids. Th e rash resolved, but by then acne, weight gain, and mood swings—all the result of steroid use—had made this formerly vivacious young woman obese and miserable. Her story was classic: her gut buddies had been car pet-bombed, the gang members had moved in, and her own immune system had begun to mistakenly attack he r. When I came on board, our job was to initiate an al l-out effort to stop the incoming attacks from lect ins, restore the gut wall, and rebuild the gut buddies. We started to rapidly taper her off steroids and in stituted the Plant Paradox Program. Within three months, Lydia w as completely off steroids, the acne had cleared, t he rashes on her face and arms had disappeared, and th e excess weight was falling off. Her depression has also lifted. All was well. Then, one morning a few months later, Lydia came ru nning into the office in a panic. By chance, I was sitting at the front desk, filling out a form, and looked u p to see this lovely woman covered from head to toe with huge red blotches, the classic erythema multiforme , a symptom of an autoimmune reaction in lupus. She sheepishly admitted that she had had a piece of sou rdough bread the night before, and woke up with thi s gift. Luckily, a little Benadryl and quercetin tided her over, but it was a lesson she’ll never forget. RULE NUMBER 3: Fruit Might as Well Be Candy Forget any idea that fruit is a health food. As you ’ve learned, eating fruit in season allowed our anc estors to fatten up for the winter, but now fruit is ubiquitous 365 days a year. The next time you ask for a fruit sala d as a “healthy” breakfast, I suggest that instead you order a bowl of Skittles candy. Go ahead—it’s the same poisonous stuff. The corollary to Rule Number 3 is this: If it has seeds , it’s a fruit! That means that a zucchini, a tomat o, a bell pepper, an eggplant, and a pickle are all fruits! And when you eat them, they deliver the same chemical message t o your genes and your brain as a more obvious fruit, such as an apple, does: Store fat for the winter. Moreover (an d this will surprise most of you), eating the fructose in fruit causes your kidneys to swell and suffer injury, wh ich can destroy them. 2 Just to be clear, there are three fruits that you can have, so long as you eat them when they are still green: bananas, mangoes, and papayas. Unripe tropical fruit has not yet increased its sugar (fructose) content. Instea d, it is made up of resistant starches, the things your good gut bug s love to dine on, but we mere humans don’t have th e enzymes to digest. Green papaya and mango are great sliced in a salad. Green banana flour comes in handy for maki ng grain- free pancakes and baked goods. Our dear friend the avocado is the only acceptable ripe fruit because i t contains nary a trace of sugar and is composed of good fat a nd soluble fiber, which help you lose weight and ab sorb fat- soluble vitamins and antioxidants. I covered the next concept several times in Part I, but it is so important that it deserves to be my f ourth and final rule. RULE NUMBER 4: You Are What the Thing You Are Eating, Ate"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"If you prefer, think of this as a piece of parental advice: When you sleep with someone, you are sleep ing with everyone that person ever slept with! If you eat me at, poultry, farm-raised fish, eggs, and dairy prod ucts, you are largely an ear of corn and a pile of soybeans, beca use that is what almost all industrially raised foo d animals are regularly fed. The Elephant Not in the Room WHY HAVE I not mentioned how many calories you can consume a day? The old rule, that a calorie in equals a calorie out, assumes that you are absorbing all those calories. It doesn’t facto r in the fact that on the Plant Paradox Program, your gut buddies have an amazing ability t o consume a lot of the calories that you ingest. Th ey use those calories to grow lots of little clones, either maki ng the calories unavailable to you or changing them into life- promoting special fats that power you. On this prog ram, you will make sure that your gut buddies get t heir fair share, which means you can actually eat far more fo od than you used to eat and still lose weight. I ki d you not. In fact, as my friend Dr. Terry Wahls likes to say, yo u’ll see evidence of this with the large bowel move ment “snakes” coiled in your toilet! We’ll get into specifics about what you will and wi ll not be eating below and then again in greater de tail in the following chapters. Your food choices will expand a s you heal your gut and your tolerance for certain lectin- containing foods grows as you advance through the t hree phases of the Plant Paradox Program. But unlik e most “diet plans,” there will be no calorie counting or carb counting. All you have to watch is your intake of animal protein. Feasting on Corn CORN IS OMNIPRESENT in the standard American diet, especially in proce ssed foods. Fast food restaurants rely on corn oil, cornstarch, cornmeal, corn syrup, and a host of other ingredients extracted from cor n. When scientists examined approximately 480 burgers from a gamut of fast food restaurants, they found that a lmost all of them, a whopping 93 percent, contained a “signature ” C-4 carbon that indicates that the meat that comp rised the burger came from corn (meaning the animal’s diet wa s corn-heavy). 3 If that drives you to order a chicken sandwich next time you grab a bite at a fast food restaurant , hear this: The meat in chicken sandwiches were si milarly made from corn. In fact, all the chicken served in the f ast food places in the study originated from one so urce, Tyson, which feeds chickens corn—and only corn. There is n o escaping corn in such chain restaurants. If 93 percent of the ground beef in a burger origin ated with corn, the next logical question may be “H ow much of me originated with corn?” Do you want to hear the g ood news first? It’s less than 93 percent. Now for the bad news: Scientists at the University of California–Berkeley carbon-tested strands of hair from typical America ns and found that 69 percent was from corn. 4 (Even health guru Sanjay Gupta’s hair analysis foun d the exact same percentage of carbon from corn. 5 ) And here’s the shocker: When the same carbon test was performed on strands of hair from typical Europeans, the corn content was a mere 5 pe rcent. Unfortunately, there’s even worse news. Most field corn (the type fed to livestock) grown in the Unite d States is a genetically modified version called Bt corn. A gene for a potent lectin from the snowdrop plant is ins erted into this corn to improve its insect resistance. And once tha t lectin makes it into corn and is fed to cows, chi ckens, and pigs, and then you eat those animals or drink cow’s milk, it makes its way into you! This is a lectin to whi ch everyone reacts, and it’s even found in the breast milk of A merican mothers. Another sobering point: Genetically modified corn p roduces osteopenia and osteoporosis in chickens. 6 (And you thought only postmenopausal women developed these t wo bone-deterioration diseases.) One reason chicken s are crammed together in their pens is that their leg bo nes are so brittle from their diet that they fractu re when the birds try to walk. So, ladies, the next time you take you r osteoporosis medication in the morning and have a boneless chicken breast for lunch or dinner, ask yourself a variation of that age-old question: Which came firs t, the chicken"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"chicken breast for lunch or dinner, ask yourself a variation of that age-old question: Which came firs t, the chicken or the osteoporosis? Actually, the correct answer i s corn. Again, you are eating the stuff that these animals ate. 7 Because our livestock have been routinely given ant ibiotics, they have become hosts to multiple forms of antibiotic- resistant bacteria. Almost weekly, we hear another report of a meat or chicken recall because of an ou tbreak of deadly diarrhea. Wait—I’m not done yet. It turns out that chicken (e ggs and flesh), pork, beef, and cow’s milk are cont aminated with aflatoxins, toxic by-products of molds and fungi th at grow on corn, wheat, and soybeans. These compoun ds are toxic to animals and humans, and their consumption has been linked to genetic changes and cancer. 8 Cereal grains and soybeans (the type fed to poultry) are particul arly subject to aflatoxin contamination. 9 While the U.S. Department of Agriculture sets standards for the am ount of fungal toxins that are allowed in corn, gra ins, and soybeans fed to our chickens, turkeys, cows, and pi gs, there is no control over or requirement about t he maximum amount of these toxins that are allowed in the fini shed products—the meats that we eat and the milk th at we drink. And, quite frankly, it’s a staggeringly high amount . It seems the USDA is more concerned about food an imals consuming these toxins than humans eating those sam e toxins in animals. Think about that the next time you order a serving of Chicken McNuggets. You might be gettin g a double whammy of aflatoxins from the chicken as well as the breading. Add a glass of milk and you up your c hances of toxification. SUCCESS STORY She’d Rather Switch than Fight Multiple Sclerosis Marcia D., a beautiful twenty-nine-year-old, was re ferred to me with chronic progressive multiple scle rosis (MS), despite taking heavy immunosuppressant meds a nd following a gluten-free, mostly vegetarian diet. Persistent brain fog and progressive numbness of he r left hand made getting to and from work difficult , so she had to work from home. She had noted some impro vement after going gluten-free, but some of her favorite gluten-free foods—like corn chips, potatoe s, and tomatoes—seemed to worsen her symptoms. As usual, her blood work showed the typical pattern of lectin sensitivity and exposure to foods that cont ain them. Out those foods went, and within three months, Marc ia was back at work and off the immuno-suppressant drugs, and the brain fog and numbness were gone. That was five years ago. Her recent blood work refl ects the banishment of lectins from her diet, altho ugh I do get the occasional phone call for help. I remember one panicked call well. She had awakened one mornin g with her left fingers going numb and her brain fogg y. “What were you doing last night?” I asked. “I wa s with some friends and had a slice of gluten-free pizza,” she replied. Now, gluten-free pizza is a fabulous lectin bomb, usually with a crust made of oat, corn, or ri ce flour, plus tomato sauce and cheese made from co ws with the casein A-1 mutation. You get the idea. I a sked Marcia what she expected by eating that pizza? Her answer was that she was thirty-three years old and had to have a life! “Fine,” I replied. “Do that and enjoy your life from a wheelchair. It’s always your choic e.” She has never wavered since that morning. The Buddy System BACK TO RULE Number 2, which applies to the good bugs, your gut buddies. Friendly bacteria are like neighbors who are invested in the neighborhood (you r body). Your objective is to protect and encourage their growth, but typically their needs and wants have be en pushed aside in favor of the bad bugs. As a resu lt, the good bugs are hiding in their homes, afraid to come out. But if you starve the bad guys and throw the good guys a lifeline, the good guys will reemerge to support the neighbor hood. What’s more, those good bacteria will start a sking you for more of what they need to succeed. I’ve been am used and pleased through the years when dyed-in-the -wool “meat and potatoes” people come back to see me afte r a couple months on the program and tell me that t hey now crave salads full of green things. In fact, when th ey go a couple of days without one, they are ready to kill to get to"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"crave salads full of green things. In fact, when th ey go a couple of days without one, they are ready to kill to get to the salad bar! They are completely shocked by their own behavior, which is now controlled by a new set of microbes, their true gut buddies, giving out new se ts of instructions. These good bacteria are saying loud and clear to their hosts, “Please help take care of our home. ” The most important gift your gut buddies can give y ou is to direct your appetite and manage your cravi ngs. This frees you from the constant battle to control your desires, along with the chore of calorie counting a nd the effort to demonize those wonderful-looking junk foods. Give y our gut buddies what they want and they will return the favor. 10 Soon, the bad bugs responsible for those cravings w ill have left the building. Those unremitting cravings that often torture peopl e on high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets do not occur when the source of protein is fish and there are pl enty of resistant carbs from greens and tubers. But the fats in high- protein diets tend to come from the lard in beef an d saturated fats in other farm animals. The LPSs in your gut hop on these saturated fats to sneak through the wall o f your gut; then they are directly transported to t he hunger center in your brain, the hypothalamus. There, the resulti ng inflammation in your brain sparks your hunger. This absence of constant hunger is one way in which the Plant Paradox Program differs significantly fr om Paleo and some ketogenic diets, both of which include plenty of animal fats. The Plant Paradox Program contains only appropriate animal fats—and let me remind you that there are vegetarian and vegan versions of the prog ram for those who eat no meat, fish, or poultry and for tho se who also don’t touch dairy or eggs. People who i nsist that we need to eat animal protein will soon learn what any gorilla knows: there is a huge amount of muscle-bu ilding protein in leaves. Not convinced? Just look at a ho rse. He didn’t get those sleek muscles from munchin g on burgers. An Overview of the Plant Paradox Program THE REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH of the Plant Paradox Program will help you achieve both optimal health and the ability to manage your weight by feeding yo u and your good gut bugs what you both need. We’ll get into the specifics of the three phases that constitute t he Plant Paradox Program in the following three cha pters. Meanwhile, here are the basics: • PHASE 1: This three-day cleanse begins the process of repai ring your gut, fortifying the good microbes, and banishing most of the bad microbes. At the end of t he three days, your gut organisms will have changed , and therefore, your gut has changed. But you must move directly from Phase 1 to Phase 2 to prevent the alm ost immediate return of the bad guys. • PHASE 2: Here is where the Plant Paradox Program really kic ks in. All I ask is that you give me two weeks, and in return I’ll give you back your life. After t wo weeks, you will feel and see the change—it is th at powerful. And after six weeks, you’ll have engrained these ne w eating habits. During this time, I’m going to ask you to eliminate or reduce certain foods and eat more of o thers. Here’s an overview: • Initially, you’ll eliminate major lectins (grai ns and legumes, including corn and soybeans, which also contain estrogenlike substances), GMO foods, crops treated with Roundup, and many saturated fats. This includes whole-grain products, which hypersensitize the immune system. But fear not, vegetarians and vegans, I have a solution for you below. • Eliminate all sugars and artificial sweeteners. • Minimize intake of most omega-6 fats, which pro mpt the body’s attack mode, encouraging fat storage and hunger. • Eliminate industrial farm–raised poultry (inclu ding so-called free-range poultry) and livestock (a long with their dairy products) and all farm-raised fish , which are fed antibiotics, corn, and beans full o f omega-6s and laced with Roundup. • You may have a small serving of nuts, guacamole , or simply half a Hass avocado as a snack. 11 You will find that over time, if you are eating the rig ht foods, you no longer feel the need for snacks. T he wrong foods, on the other hand, simply make you hun grier."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"• Avoid using all endocrine-disrupting products. • Instead, you’ll consume the following: • All leafy greens and certain vegetables, and a substantial amount of tubers and other foods that contain resistant starch. Initially, you will give fruit the boot. Later, you can reintroduce it only in its real season, and only as “candy.” • Consume more omega-3 fats, particularly those f ound in fish oil, perilla oil, flaxseed oil, and ot her approved oils, such as avocado, walnut, olive, or m acadamia nut, as well as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), all of which allow speedy rep air of the gut barrier. • Consume no more than 8 ounces of animal protein a day (remember, fish and shellfish are animals), primarily as wild-caught fish and shellfi sh, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids and have no artery-destroying Neu5Gc, as well as eggs from p astured or omega-3-fed chickens. • Only 4 ounces of your daily protein should come from grass-fed or pasture-raised meat, which have more omega-3 and fewer omega-6 oils than anima ls fed grains and soy, but still do contain lots of Neu5Gc. • Consume dairy products only from certain breeds of cows or from sheep, goats, and water buffalo, which make casein A-2. However, in general, with th e exception of ghee, limit all dairy products, owing to the presence of Neu5Gc. • PHASE 3 (optional): Reduce intake of all animal protein, i ncluding fish, to a total of 2 to 4 ounces a day an d fast intermittently. • The Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program, introduced in chapter 10, is designed for those of you with diabetes, cancer, or kidney failure, or who have be en diagnosed with neurologic diseases such as demen tia, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or ALS. If that describes you, do the Three-Day Kick-Start Cleanse, then go directly to chapter 10 and dive in. I’ll provide instruction s to determine when, if ever, you may segue to Phas e 2. Glad Tidings for Vegetarians and Vegans MY PRACTICE INCLUDES a large number of vegetarians and vegans who have asked for my help over the years. Unfortunately, most of them were what I call “pasta-grain-bean-atarians.” Asking them to give u p their usual sources of plant protein, regardless of the fact th at these foods were making them sick, has been a st ruggle for them and for me. Fortunately, by working with my vegetar ian and vegan “canaries,” I have found ways around the problem. Here’s the first piece of good news: A pre ssure cooker will destroy the lectins in beans and other legumes, which are a fantastic source of nonvegetable protei n, as well as in vegetables in the nightshade and s quash families (actually fruits). Better yet, pressure-cooked bean s, shorn of their offending lectins, serve as a smo rgasbord for your gut buddies, and can improve longevity and enhance memory. More good news: Most natural foods stores a nd Whole Foods stock brands of beans and other legumes in cans that are not lined with BPA. Westbrae Natu ral and Eden Foods are two such brands. (Eden Foods pressur e-cooks the beans in the can.) Thus vegetarians and vegans can consume small amounts of properly prepared legu mes and certain other lectin-containing foods in Ph ase 2 of the Plant Paradox Program. Unfortunately, the lectins in wheat, rye, barley, a nd oats—yes, the gluten-containing grains—cannot be destroyed, so these foods remain off-limits. But using a press ure cooker does destroy the lectins in other grains and pseudo- grains, making them safe for consumption. (See “Not Grandma’s Pressure Cooker,” below.) In fact, becau se the lectins are destroyed, their role in weight gain is also reduced. But please do not introduce these fo ods until Phase 3, if at all. Remember, humans have no need for these grains. Let me embrace my vegan and vegetarian colleagues a nd friends once more, along with anyone else who wa nts to reduce his or her intake of animal protein. All tha t stands between you and true health are the lectin s in beans and certain grains that can be destroyed in a few minut es on your countertop."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Not Grandma’s Pressure Cooker You may be disinclined to purchase a pressure cooke r, fearing that it could be dangerous. Almost every one who grew up in the 1950s has heard about a pressure cooker exploding and creating a terrible mess, and perhaps even burning the cook. Pressure cookers fro m that era had just one mechanical regulator, which could allow pressure to build up with disastrous ef fects. Today’s appliances are a whole different sto ry, thanks to a metal interlocking lid designed to with stand enormous pressure, an airtight gasket, and a relief valve to allow the device to maintain a constant pr essure. They are also surprisingly affordable. Look for an automatic one, such as the Cuisinart or Instant Pot brands, which shut off when the cooking cycle is complete. For a hassle-free, lectin-free lifestyle, a good pressure cooker can’t be beat. What Is the Right Amount of Protein? Consuming sufficient protein is essential to power your body and build muscle. And the protein you con sume must provide the essential amino acids that supply the building blocks of protein you cannot make your self. However, most Americans consume far more protein, p articularly animal protein, than they need. Government subsidies of corn, other grains, and soy beans that are fed to industrial-farmed animals, po ultry, and even fish mean that animal protein has become r idiculously inexpensive. No matter how cheap, no on e needs to eat a pound of sirloin at a sitting. As we ’ve discussed, overconsuming and then having to met abolize large amounts of protein into sugar is associated w ith higher blood sugar levels, obesity, and a short er life span. 12 Moreover, certain amino acids in animal protein—met hionine, leucine, and isoleucine—seem to be real culprits for promoting rapid aging and cancer growth. 13 So how much protein do you actually need? Most protein recommendations are based not o n your weight but on your lean body mass, which requires a number of complex calculations to ascertain. But to make it r eally easy, both Dr. Valter Longo of the Longevity Instit ute at the University of Southern California and I agree that people require only 0.37 grams of protein per kilogram of body wei ght . 14 Since 1 kilogram equals 2.2 pounds, a 150-pound man needs about 25 grams of pro tein daily and a 125-pound woman about 21 grams. You can calculate this for yourself by dividing you r weight in pounds by 2.2 to get your weight in kil ograms, and then multiplying that number by 0.37 to get you r required daily grams of protein. To give you a ge neral sense, you’ll get 20 grams of protein from one scoo p of protein powder, about two and a half whole egg s, a Quest bar, 2 to 3 ounces of fish or chicken, a 3-ou nce can of tuna, a 3.75-ounce can of sardines, or 4 ounces of canned crabmeat. To best judge your intake of an imal protein, just remember the rule “Eat one and y ou’re done,” meaning a single 3-ounce serving a day. And please, do not fall into the “protein-combining ” trap, which means that you must eat all essential amino acids at every meal. This is total nonsense from an evolutionary standpoint. Your ancestors didn’t exa mine their food choices each meal to make sure that they were getting the right combination of proteins. Yo ur body recycles essential amino acids; you don’t need a fr esh batch of each and every essential amino acid fr om protein on a daily basis. To complicate matters, the calculations above do no t take into account that every day we recycle about 20 grams of our own protein that has sloughed from our intestines and mucus. In other words, both mucus a nd your gut lining cells contain protein, and when muc us is produced or your gut lining cells die and are replaced, we digest these proteins in our gut. Your digestive system is very economical! If you want t o be a real protein-calculating purist, you could eliminat e another half of the already low protein recommend ation because you are recycling your own protein daily. A s you can see, our protein needs are shockingly sma ll. In actual practice, this means that if you had two medium eggs at breakfast (about 15 grams of protein ), a big salad topped with an ounce of soft goat cheese (abo ut 5 grams) for lunch, a couple of tablespoons of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"salad topped with an ounce of soft goat cheese (abo ut 5 grams) for lunch, a couple of tablespoons of pistachios (about 3 grams) for a snack, and 3 ounce s of salmon with dinner (22 grams), you’d be far exceeding your protein needs—and I am not even coun ting the protein in the vegetables you are eating. Yes, there is protein in vegetables. Half a cup of steam ed cauliflower supplies 1 gram of protein; a medium baked sweet potato, 2 grams; and an artichoke, about 4 gr ams. Protein adds up quickly, and as you’ll see, I’ m going to be lenient about the amount of protein you can h ave initially on the Plant Paradox Program. But by Phase 3, for very good reasons, you are going to try to s ignificantly restrict both your overall protein int ake and the amount of animal protein. Forget Your Excuses and Get Inspired IN PART I , I talked about supposedly healthy foods that do n ot live up to their name. As a plant paradox newbie , you may have still some lingering doubts about the wisdom of cutting out whole grains, organic chicken , cow’s milk yogurt, edamame, tofu, and other foods that ar e marketed as “healthy.” You’ll need to get over th at hurdle to succeed on the Plant Paradox Program. On the one ha nd, the program is very simple—what other diet has only four rules?—but, admittedly, it does require some mental and physical realignment if you have been eating t he typical overproteinized American diet, or even if you have been dutifully consuming what you think is healthy food. Ditto if you have been eating a variety of vegetables wit hout understanding the significant differences betw een, say, a potato and a yam. Below are some of the most common excuses, as exemplified by the experiences of some of my patients who have become plant paradox advocates af ter changing their way of eating and experiencing d ramatic changes in their health—and often their weight. Whe n you read of their dramatic recoveries, you will p robably decide that you, too, are willing to make some rela tively small changes in order to have major changes in your health, weight, and overall sense of well-being. Don’t let any of these excuses keep you from moving forward with the program. EXCUSE #1: You Are Already Slim, Fit, and Active If so, you may feel there is no need to change your way of eating. What follows is the story of an out wardly fit man who did not know that he had a serious health probl em, with increased risk for even more serious probl ems. Fortunately, when he found out, he decided to do so mething about it. Resigning himself to accept the i nevitable was never an option. EXCUSE #1 SUCCESS STORY An Extreme Athlete Betters All His Numbers Simon V. came to see me on the advice of a friend. He was forty years old, cycled 150 to 200 miles a w eek, was slim and muscular, and from all appearances was in great shape. Initially, he was interested in im proving his athletic performance, but a test revealed that he was not going to enjoy a healthy life span. His oxidized LDL (“bad”) cholesterol level, an indicator of how sticky your cholesterol is, was extremely high, and he had low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. He also carried what’ s commonly called the Alzheimer’s gene, known as ApoE4 (30 percent of us carry that gene). Fortunate ly, I am the world’s expert on the dietary approach for people with ApoE4. After adopting the Plant Paradox Program, Simon reduced his body fat to a remarkabl y low 8 percent and lost eight pounds. His oxidized L DL went from 107 to 47, which is within the normal range, and his HDL is now up to 62, also in the nor mal range. Not only did Simon improve his chances f or living a long, healthy life, he also bettered his a thletic performance. He can now sustain a heart rat e of 180 beats per minute for thirty minutes, and his restin g heart rate dropped an additional eight points."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"EXCUSE #2: You Are Worried That the Program Requires a Deep U nderstanding of Human Metabolism and Nutritional Concepts The good news is that I have several patients who h ave Down syndrome or are otherwise intellectually c hallenged, who have had great results.

As you now know, ba cteria and other single-cell organisms can control you in many ways, including creating an insatiable appetit e and making you crave the wrong foods. These invaders have take n over, “partying” in your gut, while you suffer th e consequences. It is time to drive them out. Just as a gardener or farmer prepares the soil befo re planting, you need to prepare the environment in your gut before you sow the seeds of wellness. Think of the French word “ terroir,” which refers to the combination of soil, climate, and region that produces a distinctive win e, as a metaphor for the individual environment in your gut. Based on my experience studying tens of thousands o f patients, I can assure you that if your gut is da maged, you can eat all sorts of good-for-you foods but you sim ply won’t benefit from them. That’s where this thre e-day cleanse —or modified fast, if you prefer to think of it tha t way—comes in; it begins the process of restoring your gut. Well-designed studies have shown that a three-day c leanse completely changes the types of bacteria tha t inhabit your gut—yet within a day of reverting to your old habits, all the good guys leave and the bad guys mo ve back in. 1 But here’s an important point: While everyone has b een focusing on the bugs that live in your colon, r ecent research suggests that the real war is happening in your small intestine. 2 Doctors and scientists have been focused on testing patients’ stools because we haven’t had the tools t o reach the small intestine, but that’s where the a ction begins. Only the Plant Paradox Program focuses on your enti re gut and the buddies that live everywhere in and on you. Because it is so important to keep those gut buddie s around, you will move directly into Phase 2 after three days on the cleanse. Despite the solid research on how a th ree-day cleanse changes gut flora cited above, thes e three days are optional. Feel free to start in Phase 2 if you prefer, but understand that it will take a bit long er to achieve results. PHASE 1 Strategies PREPARE YOUR GUT for “planting” a new crop by weeding out the bad t hings and preparing the “soil” for the good things. In just three days, this modified fast or cleanse doesn’t just repair your gut, it also r epels invaders—the gut busters—by starving many of the gut bacteria th at make us sick and fat and stimulate an immune res ponse. The complete cleanse is composed of three components, a nd while I recommend you follow all three protocols , you will still see results even if you just follow the three -day food plan. COMPONENT 1: On and Off the Menu During this short cleanse, you will eat no dairy, g rains or pseudo-grains, fruit, sugar, seeds, eggs, soy, nightshade plants, roots, or tubers. Also off the menu are cor n, soy, canola, or other inflammatory oils, along w ith any form of beef or other farm animal meat. Instead, you will eat delectable dishes made with vegetables and sma ll amounts of fish or pastured chicken. We also provide vegetaria n and vegan options for recipes that include fish o r chicken. This three-day protocol is based on the Kick-Start Clean se, which my good friend Irina Skoeries designed fo r the Plant Paradox Program. The founder of Catalyst Cuisine, I rina developed the recipes for this phase, some of which also recur in the Phase 2 meal plan. Meal plans for Phas e 1 appear on “ Sample Meal Plans for Phase 1 section ” and include vegan and vegetarian versions. Recipes star t here and similarly provide vegan and vegetarian variatio ns.

By removing all the proscribed foods, you, too, will extinguish the fla mes of inflammation, allowing your body to begin th e process of healing. The ingredients for the cleanse recipes can be foun d at most well-stocked supermarkets. Irina also now has a successful healthy meal delivery service, available throughout the continental United States, which sh ips meals in an insulated container. You can order the three-day cleanse from her and save yourself some work. (For more information, visit www.catalystcuisine.com.) Or you can modify her recipes or use your own, as long as you follow these guidelines: Vegetables • Welcome to the wonderful world of vegetables, w ith particular emphasis on the cabbage family, incl uding bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, any color and type of cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and mustard gr eens. Greens include endive, all kinds of lettuce, spinac h, Swiss chard, and watercress. Also on the menu ar e artichokes, asparagus, celery, fennel, and radishes , along with such fresh herbs as mint, parsley, bas il, and cilantro, plus garlic and all kinds of onions, incl uding leeks and chives. Don’t forget the ocean vege tables kelp and seaweed, including sheets of nori. • You can eat as much as you want of these vegeta bles, either cooked or raw. If you have irritable b owel syndrome (IBS), SIBO, diarrhea, or another gut issu e, limit the raw veggies and cook the rest thorough ly. Protein • Consume no more than 8 ounces of wild-caught fi sh (such as salmon, shellfish, or mollusks) or past ured chicken a day in two 4-ounce portions (about the si ze of a deck of cards). Certain Quorn products, tem peh (without grains), and hemp tofu are also acceptable . Fats and Oils • You can and should have a whole Hass avocado ea ch day. Olives of any kind are also permitted. • Use only avocado oil, coconut oil, macadamia nu t oil, sesame seed oil, walnut oil, extra-virgin ol ive oil, hemp seed oil, and flaxseed oil. MCT oil (sometimes called liquid coconut oil), perilla oil, and Thriv e algae oil, which we will discuss later, are also good choices but may be difficult to find in stores. They are al l available online. Snacks • Have one or two small snacks of Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole , or simply half an avocado splashed with lemon juice, or ¼ cup of Dr. G.’s New and Improved World-Famous Nut Mix , or any combination of the approved nuts. Condiments and Seasonings • Use fresh lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, freshl y cracked black pepper and sea salt, and your favor ite herbs and spices. • Avoid any commercially prepared salad dressings or sauces. Beverages"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"• Have a Green Smoothie each morning. • Drink 8 cups a day of tap or filtered water, or San Pellegrino or other Italian sparkling mineral water (or Acqua Panna, a still mineral water). • Also drink plenty of green, black, or herbal te a, or regular or decaffeinated coffee. • If you wish, sweeten your tea or coffee with st evia extract (preferably SweetLeaf, which also cont ains inulin) or Just Like Sugar (inulin). And Don’t Forget • Get at least eight hours of sleep. • Exercise in moderation, preferably outdoors. Only the Best THE SOURCE AND quality of the foods you use to make your meals an d snacks are critical. Preferably: • All vegetables should be 100 percent organic. • Vegetables can be fresh or frozen. If fresh, th ey should be in season and grown locally with susta inable farming practices, if at all possible. • All fish and shellfish should be wild caught. • All chicken should be pastured. But as I always say, just do the best you can. Foll owing these guidelines ensures that the foods you’l l be eating provide the maximum amount of nutrients and the lea st amount of disruptors and lectins. I realize that occasionally, if the organic version is unavailable, you may have to use conventional produce, but it’s important to understand that the purer the ingredients, the better the resu lts of the cleanse. To ensure that you are not creating inflammation wh en cooking or dressing foods, you’ll be using only certain oils. Phase 1 recipes use avocado oil for sautéing, but you can also cook with most of the oils listed above. Extra-virgin olive oil should never be exposed to high heat, but low heat is fine. Hemp seed and flaxseed oils shou ld not be heated at all, so confine their use to dressing sal ads and other vegetables. See “ Make the Cleanse Easy ” for time-saving tips. COMPONENT 2: Prepare the “Soil” and Remove the “Weeds” My oldest patient, Michelle Q., whom I profiled in my first book, is now 105 years old! She still walk s into my office in her two-inch-high heels, dressed to the n ines, with her hair and makeup impeccable. When she became my patient fifteen years ago, I asked her why she had come to see me. She answered that I was the only do ctor who talked just like the late, great nutritionist Gaylo rd Hauser, who changed her life when she was in her twenties. Thanks to Michelle, I have read everything that Hau ser ever wrote, and over the years I have incorpora ted much of what he taught into my practice. I have tested his dictums on myself, as well as on my patients, and n ot surprisingly, the sophisticated blood tests that I use have confi rmed most of his teachings. Hauser’s first rule was to start with as clean a sl ate within your gut as possible. His herbal laxativ e was designed to do just that, by preparing your gut for “planting” a new crop by weeding out the bad things and prepar ing the “soil” for good things. While not critical, Hauser’s recom mendation to clean the gut with an herbal laxative called Swiss Kriss or the equivalent has been good advice for ne arly a century, and it will absolutely kick-start t he great results of the Plant Paradox Program. You can find Swiss Kriss in any pharmacy or order i t online. The active ingredient is the laxative her b senna, or"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"You can find Swiss Kriss in any pharmacy or order i t online. The active ingredient is the laxative her b senna, or sennosides—each tablet contains 8.5 mg. Other gang- member-destroying ingredients include anise seed, c alendula flower, caraway seed, hibiscus, peach leaves, peppe rmint oil, and strawberry leaves, along with some b inding agents. An adult dose is two tablets, taken at bedt ime. If you do not want to do this or are concerned about the potential discomfort it might cause, let me stress that using this laxative is absolutely optional. If you do opt to use it, take it the night before you begin the cleanse, along with a glass of water. (If you prefer the fl ake form of the product, take half a teaspoon.) There is no need to repeat it on the following days. It is a good idea to start this part of the Three-Day Kick-Start Cleanse when you are pl anning to be at home the next morning. COMPONENT 3: Supplemental Assistance Ideally, you shouldn’t just stop with preparing the soil and killing the “weeds.” I have been very imp ressed with the ability of several natural supplements to kill bad gut bacteria, molds, and fungi. None of these are a bsolutely essential; however, if you suffer from IBS, leaky g ut, or any autoimmune condition, please consider ad ding these to your initial regimen. I’ll provide doses in the supplement section . The suggested supplements include: • Oregon grape root extract or its active ingredi ent berberine • Grapefruit seed extract (not to be confused wit h another great supplement, grape seed extract) • Mushrooms or mushroom extracts • Spices such as black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and wormwood to kill parasites, fungi, and other ba d gut flora Reap the Rewards LET ME REMIND you that by following a fast or cleanse, even in a mere three days you can change the balance of microbes in your system to more friendly species . That’s the good news. But if you just do a cleans e or fast and then return to your old way of eating, any improvem ent in your gut flora will be short-lived and the b ad guys will return with a vengeance. On the other hand, if you immediately transition to a gut buddy–promoting die t, namely Phase 2 of the Plant Paradox Program, beginning the day after you complete the cleanse, you will be on your way to solidifying the gains you’ve achieved. At the end of the three days, you will: • Absolutely change the balance of your gut bacte ria for the better. • Almost certainly lose three or four excess poun ds, which will be primarily water weight. • Dramatically reduce inflammation. • Have an improved sense of well-being thanks to reduced inflammation. • Solidify the gains (and losses) you’ve achieved by moving immediately on to Phase 2. Tips for Success DURING THESE THREE days, you will eat delicious food; however, your b ody will likely miss all the addictive (and inflammation-promoting) foods to which it is a ccustomed. You might experience some hunger and per haps some energy depletion. If you find that you need to eat more than the suggested meals on the Phase 1 m eal plan, select items from the list of acceptable vegetables , but do not have more than the two servings of gua camole or avocado or any additional fish or chicken. And befo re turning to more food, try drinking a couple of c ups of tap or filtered water. You may well hate me for those seventy-two hours! B ut by Day 4, when you move to Phase 2, you will lov e the fact that your energy has returned in spades and yo ur jeans are noticeably looser."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Before we move to Phase 2, and at the risk of sound ing like a broken record, it is absolutely crucial that you segue immediately from Phase 1 to Phase 2. To keep your g ut buddies working for the home team, begin Phase 2 on the morning of Day 4. Turn the page to get up to speed on this next phase."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"8 Phase 2 Repair and Restore If your boat is sinking and water is gushing into t he hull, instead of bailing faster or using a bigge r bucket, both of which are an exercise in futility, you need to plug the holes. Likewise, if you have a health problem, slowing its progress, as modern medicine suggests, is not a sol ution; instead, you need to stop the problem in its tracks. Only then can your body start to heal itself. Believe me , your body has the ability to restore itself to pe rfect health, once you eliminate the foods and other forces that preve nt it from healing. Now that you’ve initiated the weeding phase of the Plant Paradox Program, it’s time to begin the six-w eek (minimum) repair process. The first step is to stop eating the foods full of lectins that are continua lly blowing holes in the walls of your gut. If you did the three-day cleanse, you have already begun to eliminate such f oods. Once more, let me emphasize the point embodied in Rule N umber 1 (see chapter 6 )—contrary to everything you’ve been led to believe, it’s the things you don’t eat that will dramatically change your health. Onc e you have that principle firmly established in your mind and practice it on a daily basis, you can move on to Rule Number 2, wh ich says that eating certain foods and taking certain supplements nourish the good bacteria—aka “gut buddies”—and th eir friends, which have begun to come out of hiding dur ing the three days of Phase 1. Simultaneously, you’ ll continue to starve the bad bacteria by eliminating the foods they thrive on, along with other disruptive produc ts that hinder healing. Make no mistake. For the first two weeks, this will be a challenge, because you will be removing a hug e number of so-called healthy foods, which are actually making you sick. You might even suffer some withdrawal sym ptoms, such as low energy, headaches, grouchiness, and mus cle cramps. If so, understand that it merely confir ms the old adage: the definition of an addict is someone who u ses or eats something that he or knows is killing h im, but does so nonetheless. All I ask is that you give me two week s during which you will hate me, and then see how m uch you like me after that. But remember, although you will see the changes in two weeks, it takes at least si x weeks to cement new habits. Stay the course for six weeks an d you will find that it becomes virtually automatic . The short food lists I promised you follow. For the next two weeks, you should eat foods only from the Say “Yes Please” list, and you should not eat any foods from the Just Say “No” list. The Phase 2 recipes include many of these “Yes Please” foods. Phase 2 meal plans appear here , again including vegan and vegetarian variations. (Depending on how you respond to the first two week s, you may be able to slowly and incrementally star t reintroducing some lectin-containing foods on that list, but I strongly advise you to not add such foo ds for the full six weeks.) I suggest you copy this list and carry it with you wherever you go. Take it to the superma rket and restaurants. Keep a copy at your workplace. Refer t o it often. Soon, following it will become second n ature. For those of you impatient folks who just couldn’t wait to start the Plant Paradox Program and jumped here without reading Part I, the list is followed by a quick sum mary of why I am telling you to do these “crazy” th ings. I sincerely hope that as you begin to see the results of following the program, you will take the time t o read the earlier chapters. It will help you understand why t he Plant Paradox Program works and why it is a life time approach to eating, not a quickie diet to follow and then re vert to your old habits."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" No Means No THE JUST SAY “NO” list is so named because no human being ever ate any of the foods on it until at least ten thousand years ago, when man began to cultivate gra ins and other crops. Until that point, grains, pseu do-grains, and beans were not part of our forebears’ diet. As a re sult, our ancestors and their gut buddies never enc ountered or dealt with the lectins from these seeds. In terms o f evolution, getting to know and develop an immunol ogical tolerance to a new lectin within a ten-thousand-yea r span is like speed dating—it simply cannot be don e. These modern seeds are totally different from the plants and other foods that form the basis of the Plant Pa radox Program. In contrast, the ancient foods you will be eating h ave been the sources of vibrant human nutrition for millions of years. Perhaps just as important, the lectins and p olyphenols in these beneficial plants and their lea ves have been prevalent in the human diet for so long that your i mmune system and your gut buddies have developed an intimate and symbiotic relationship with them. Yes, you read that right. Not all lectins are probl ematic; however, it does take time, lots of time, f or our kind to handle them and the messages they convey. Because t his messaging has been constant and consistent over millions of years, these plants foster human health. (While I am on the subject, let me again make it crystal c lear that you are not going to eliminate all lectins from your diet. However, you can control w hich ones you consume and how much.)"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"So, again, I ask you: Do you want to trust a plant that mankind has dealt with and with which it has d eveloped a mutual admiration for over millions of years, or on e that humans first encountered just a few thousand years ago? 1 If you are hesitant to answer, let me have Dirty Ha rry answer for you: “You just got to ask yourself o ne question, ‘do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?” After treati ng tens of thousands of patients, I can assure you that the folks who thought that they would get lucky by eating wha tever they wanted are the same folks who believe th at the house wants you to win at a casino. White Is Right AS WE DISCUSSED in earlier chapters, all cultures have tried to de al with the lectins that were making its members ill. For ten thousand years, mankind has be en trying to make bread white. The vast majority of the nasty lectins, especially wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), ar e in the bran, which makes the bread brown. Most cu ltures have been successful in getting rid of the bran—think of French baguettes or Italian white pasta. Italians would never countenance whole-grain pasta! (Meanwhile, brown br ead was relegated to the poor.) The same lesson app lies to rice, the dietary staple of four billion people. Ov er the eight thousand years rice has been cultivate d, why has every effort been made to remove the hull to create white rice? Well, the hull contains the lectins, and the se smart folks have figured out how to eliminate them. However, re cently all that changed with the fateful advice to eat “whole- grain goodness.” Let’s reiterate what we learned in Part I: “Whole-grain goodness” is a modern disaste r—and in fact something that your ancestors desperately and successfully tried to eliminate or lessen ever sinc e grains entered the diet. Whole-grain baguettes, croissants, pasta, sushi rice, and soba noodles? Absolute nonsense fi rst, and poison second. The King of Lectins AS WE LEARNED , beans, peas, soybeans, lentils, and other members of the legume family (often referred to as the so-called pulses) are another relatively recent agricultural addition to the human diet. An indivi dual bean may be small, but with the highest lectin content of any f ood group, beans can have a big impact. Five raw bl ack beans or kidney beans will clot your bloodstream within five minutes. Ricin, the lectin found in the castor bea n, a plant native to Africa but now thriving in Southern Calif ornia, is the most potent lectin known. A couple of molecules of ricin will kill a human within minutes, making it a favorite espionage tool. Remember, plants don’t li ke you, and they (and their babies) are armed and dangerous! Want some examples of bean chemical warfare? Massiv e outbreaks of “food poisoning” have occurred in sc hools and hospitals when, as part of a “healthy eating da ys” program, cafeterias unwittingly served undercoo ked beans. 2 According to the Centers for Disease Control, 20 pe rcent of the food poisoning cases in the United Sta tes are the result of lectins in undercooked beans. 3 Does this sound like a health food? Eating canned b eans can also raise your blood pressure, thanks to both the BPA in the linin g of most cans and the lectin content. 4 Best to give canned beans a wide berth. Ditto for tofu and edamame (green soy beans), along with any other unfermented soy produc ts. They are most definitely not the health foods they are m ade out to be. Remember, these are foods that we us e to fatten animals for slaughter. What makes you any different ? Despite these serious concerns about legumes, press ure cooking is a great way to destroy the lectins a nd retain the nutrition in lentils, kidney beans, and the rest of this large and varied plant family. (See “ Glad Tidings for Vegetarians and Vegans ” and “ Not Grandma’s Pressure Cooker .”) The Dairy Dilemma ANOTHER OF OUR culture’s food icons, placed high on the healthy f oods honor roll, is milk, which has no place in a health-conscious diet—or at least cow’s milk d oesn’t. Let me remind you that if you think you are lactose- intolerant, or if milk stimulates mucus production, you are actually reacting to the lectinlike casein A-1 protein (see"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"intolerant, or if milk stimulates mucus production, you are actually reacting to the lectinlike casein A-1 protein (see chapter 2 for a complete explanation of the casein A-1 mutation and its effect on cows around the worl d). Fortunately, goats and sheep are not affected by th is mutation, making their milk and dairy products a cceptable on the Plant Paradox Program, with the word of warning that they all have Neu5Gc, the sugar molecule asso ciated with cancer and heart disease. New World Lectins WE HAVE DISCUSSED how Christopher Columbus’s “discovery” of the Amer icas led to the introduction of New World plants to Europe, Africa, and the Far Eas t. As a side note, my Paleo friends just don’t seem to understand that no European, African, or Asian had ever been exposed to these plants (and their lectin s) before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Therefore, why they have any place on the Paleo diet is perplexing. Th e same folks who rail against the evils of grains—and I’m with t hem on that—love American plants, including the nig htshade 5 and squash families, along with peanuts and cashews , and sunflower, chia, and pumpkin seeds. Contempla te this: The lectins in the nightshade family include solani ne, a neurotoxin. 6 Again, all New World plants have troublesome lectins that most of mankind has eaten for no more than five hundred years. Even Native Americans came from Asia, so these plants are “new” to all of us. According to my friend and colleague Loren Cordain, Ph.D., author of The Paleo Diet , the first book on the subject, studies that were conducted to see whether humans c ould absorb the omega-3 fats in chia seeds proved t hat indeed they could. There was only one hitch: The researche rs had hoped to prove that these omega-3 fats would reduce inflammation. But in fact, inflammation markers in the subjects who ate chia seeds went up slightly, r ather than decreased, as had been expected. 7 You may be getting some omega-3 fatty acids from ch ia seeds but their lectin content outweighs any benefit. The Most Popular Nut Is Not a Nut The peanut, which originated in the Americas, is a legume, not a nut. As such, it is loaded with kille r lectins. Did you know that 94 percent of humans carry a pref ormed antibody to the peanut lectin? 8 Get this: The lectin in peanut oil produces atherosclerosis in ex perimental animals, including even our primate cous ins the rhesus monkey—but when that lectin is removed from the oil, atherosclerosis does not develop. 9 And here’s a stunner: When peanuts are fed to humans and their resulting bowel movements are fed to rats, precanc erous lesions appear in the rat colons. 10 All these dangerous effects are the result of consu ming the peanut lectin. Think about that the next time you are out at the b allpark! The Irritating Cashew Nut Despite its name, like the peanut, the cashew nut i s not a nut. Originally found in the Amazon rain fo rests, it, too, is a bean, which hangs separately from the fru it. Thanks to its potent lectins, Amazonians always threw the “nut” away and ate only the fruit. The shell ar ound the nut is such an irritant that cashew worker s must wear protective gloves. There are numerous reports in the dermatological medical literature of outbrea ks of rashes after consuming cashew nut butter or the nut s themselves. 11 Cashews are actually in the same botanical family as poison ivy. Keep that in mind b efore you munch on some cashews. And in my clinical experience, cashews dramatically increase inflammat ion, particularly in my patients with rheumatoid arthritis."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"SUCCESS STORY The Cashew Connection Here’s an example of what can happen when just a si ngle problematic food sneaks back into your diet. Patrice L. was an extremely thin woman who had batt led rheumatoid arthritis since her teenage years an d had the joint deformities to show for it. At age fifty- nine, she was afraid of the effect that long-term s teroids and immunosuppressants were having on her, especially w ith her advancing osteoporosis. We started the Plan t Paradox Program and within three months, she was of f steroids and all other medications and all her inflammation markers had normalized. Once she felt good, we started our routine three-month blood test and follow-up program. On her second-year visit, a typi cal marker that I follow for lectin ingestion (TNF- alpha) was mildly elevated for the first time since her ma rkers had normalized. I asked if she was cheating o n the program at all, and Patrice was aghast! “No. Never. Why would I?” she replied. So, we went down the “b ad food” list. True to her word, she was avoiding all the usual suspects like the plague. Then we got to cashews. She said she had completely forgotten that they wer e on the avoid list and had recently been on a cash ew kick! In fact, there was a bag in her car that she had been munching on the way to her appointment. On e month later, a recheck showed her inflammation was gone—along with the cashews. American Bad Guys TWO OF THE worst lectin additions to our diet are the America n grain known as corn (maize) and the pseudo- grain quinoa. We have talked at length about the da ngers of corn, but did you know that the French ban ned corn as unfit for human consumption in 1900 and allowed its use only to fatten pigs? This was prompted by an o utbreak of congenital mental retardation (cretinism) in northe rn Italians, who had adopted corn as their main gra in. As you now know, corn is not a natural food for cows either. 12 The American pseudo-grain quinoa is just as troubli ng. The Incas had three detoxification processes to remove the lectins in quinoa. First, they soaked it, then they let it rot (fermented it), and finally they cooked it. If you’ve used quinoa, you’ll know that the first two of those ins tructions are not on the package directions. Need I add that most folks who go gluten-free regard quinoa as a great s ubstitute for the grains they have foresworn? In fa ct, the lectins in this pseodo-grain quinoa only further mess with the ir gut wall. SUCCESS STORY Mother Knows Best! Alicia M., a forty-year-old Peruvian, relocated to Los Angeles from Lima a year ago but continued to e at her traditional diet, which included quinoa as her stap le starch. However, since her move, her bowels and overall health had become a mess. Bloating, sleep troubles, IBS, and brain fog welcomed her to America. Yet sh e continued her native diet (and shunned American fas t food poisons)—until she sought my help. When we got to quinoa on the Just Say “No” list, Pa trice was shocked! She had eaten it all her life wi thout any problem. When I started to explain that the Inc as had three steps to eliminate the lectins in quin oa before they ate it, her eyes flew open wide. “Oh my gosh!” she exclaimed. “My mother always said you could no t eat quinoa without first pressure cooking it. I tho ught that was just an old wives’ tale, so I have be en eating it without pressure cooking it since coming to America . And you are not going to believe this, but my mot her visited two weeks ago and bought me a pressure cook er! She was right, but I thought that she was just being old-fashioned.” Six weeks later, I got the call that I was expectin g. “You and Mom were right,” Patrice told me. “I’m back to normal, and I love my pressure cooker!”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Dealing with Deadly Nightshades YOU’LL RECALL THAT the nightshade family includes eggplants, potatoes , peppers, goji berries, and tomatoes. Would it surprise you to know that Italians refused to eat tomatoes for two centuries after their nati ve son Columbus brought them home? To this day, Italians peel and d eseed tomatoes before making tomato sauce because t he peels and seeds contain the lectins. The clever Italians also hybridized the Roma tomato to maximize the rat io of pulp to skin and seeds. Cooks then blanch the tomato in boi ling water, pull off the skin, cut the fruit in hal f, squeeze out the seeds, and presto—pulp minus the skin and seeds. An d by the way, tomato sauce and pizza were invented just a little over 120 years ago, making them very new foo ds in evolutionary terms. The same approach applies to cooked Italian red pep pers. When you open a glass jar of them, do you see any peels and seeds? No. They have been removed, which is not necessarily the case in most American products. Th e Indians of the American southwest always roast, peel, and d eseed their peppers, again to rid them of lectins. Likewise, you won’t see peels and seeds in a can of green chilies . Once more, the lectins have been removed. And why are Tabasco and other hot sauces fermented? Because usi ng bacteria to break down the lectins is a time-hon ored method of lessening the lectin load, just as the In cas did with their quinoa. There is substantial evi dence that fermentation significantly reduces lectin content. For example, fermentation in sourdough kills gluten . 13 And fermentation eliminates 98 percent of the lectins i n lentils. 14 If you are willing to invest the time, you can bani sh lectins with the age-old technique of fermentation— although a pressure cooker can do the job in a frac tion of the time. Just remember that this won’t work with glute n-containing grains. While we are on the subject of methods used to mini mize the impact of lectins, let me overturn a few m ore myths. Soaking dried grains does not remove gluten or WGA. And sprouting legumes does not make them any easie r to digest. In fact, it actually increases lectin conte nt. 15 Feeding sprouted beans or grains to lab animals has been shown to cause cancer. 16 However, as we will discuss further in the next cha pter, removing the skins and seeds from tomatoes and peppers and peeling and deseeding squa sh does reduce the lectin load. Speaking of squash . . . The Squash Family WITH THE EXCEPTION of the cucumber, which was first described in Indi a three thousand years ago, but only made its way to Africa and Europe with Columbian tr ade, the squash family hails from the Americas. As such, its members have lectins that have been foreign to huma ns for most of their evolution. It bears repeating that any “vegetable” with seeds, such as pumpkin or zucchini , is a fruit, which will have grown only during the summer. And sugars in these summer fruits that we call vege tables signal your central operating system that wi nter is coming. This means there are two reasons to avoid t he squash family: the lectin content and the store- fat-for-winter message they convey to your body.

Some of the most dangerous plant l ectins now lurk in the meat of our favorite animal foods. This is but one reason to moderate protein intake. My resea rch and that of others have confirmed that we are overproteinized as a society. From childhood, we ar e programmed to become protein-aholics. And eating modern animal protein is a major cause of our obesity cris is. 17 As you will soon learn, the single factor that stan ds out in long-lived societies is the very small amount of pr otein, and particularly animal protein, that its me mbers consume during their long life span. Limiting animal protei n—and let me remind you that a fish is an animal as well— extends health span and life span. Good Fats, Bad Fats THE OILS LISTED in the Just Say “No” list are all chemically derived from lectin-bearing seed s or beans, meaning they should be avoided as much as possible. I used to include canola oil, made from rapeseed, on my acceptable foods list; however, almost all canola o il now comes from GMO seeds, so I have removed it. For now, and for at least two weeks, I also want you to limi t your intake of all long-chain saturated fats, suc h as coconut oil and animal fats, along with most other mono- and po lyunsaturated long-chain fats, such as olive oil, a vocado oil, and MCT oil. Also limit your consumption of cheese, sour cream, heavy cream, and cream cheese (even fr om grass- fed animals), all of which contain saturated fats. Instead of using olive or coconut oil in this perio d, I recommend perilla oil. It has the highest cont ent of rosemarinic acid (from rosemary), which improves cognition and memory. 18 You may not have heard of it, but it is the primary cooking oil in Korea, Japan, and China. You can fin d it at Asian markets, natural foods stores, and Wh ole Foods, as well as from online sources. Perilla oil also has t he highest content of alpha linolenic acid, 19 a form of omega-3 fat used in the Lyon (France) Heart Diet, which has bee n shown to be more effective at preventing heart di sease than the low-fat American Heart Association diet. 20 The Lyon Heart Diet established the gold standard f or heart-healthy diets in 1994. Another good alternative is MCT oil (MCT stands for medium-chain triglycerides), which is 100 percent composed of ketones. It is sometimes called liquid coconut oil because it remains liquid even at cold temperatures. The body burns MCT ketones for fuel e asily without turning them into body fat. Unlike re gular coconut oil, it contains none of the long-chain fat ty acids on which those nasty lipopolysaccharides ( LPSs) can ride. Other good choices include macadamia nut oil, walnu t oil, avocado oil, Thrive algae oil, and ghee. (Gh ee is clarified butter, meaning that the milk solids—protein—have b een removed and with them the offending lectinlike casein.) You can also use citrus-flavored cod liver oil on s alad or to dress cooked vegetables. Along with perilla oil, which does the best job, al l of the oils and fats on the Say “Yes Please” list block LPSs from breaching the gut barrier. Unlike other polyunsatur ated fats, long-chain fish oil omega-3s also block the entry of LPSs past your gut wall. 21 I’ve mentioned before that LPSs ride into your body from your gut on saturated fats. But these fats can’t get through without special transp ort molecules called chylomicrons. The LPSs stow aw ay on chylomicrons, which are formed to carry the long-ch ain saturated fats, and hitch a ride to get through the gut wall. And the last thing you want are LPSs invading your body right now. Sadly, even my best friend, olive o il, should be limited for the first two weeks of this phase of th e Plant Paradox Program, as it, too, is carried by chylomicrons. A word of advice to any Paleo and ketogenic followe rs who believe that saturated fats are good for you : A recent study shows that saturated fats such as lard increa se hunger and appetite by delivering LPSs to the br ain’s hunger"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"study shows that saturated fats such as lard increa se hunger and appetite by delivering LPSs to the br ain’s hunger center; 22 by contrast, fish oil does exactly the opposite, ac tually sending signals to the brain that help you m oderate your food intake! 23 Is it any wonder that so many Paleo recipes are for desserts? One popular Paleo blogger’s site is called “All Day I Dream About Food.” That’s the las t thing that will happen as the Plant Paradox Progr am kicks in. The Program: Phase 2 NOW THAT YOU have the food list and some accompanying informati on, and assuming you have done the three- day cleanse (or chosen not to), it is time to put t he rest of the program into action. You will follow Phase 2 for six weeks. Why so long? Although you can begin to repai r your gut and drive out most of the gang members i n a few days with the Phase 1 cleanse, some of them are sti ll lurking, plotting to take over the neighborhood again. During Phase 2, you can’t let your guard down as you follo w the list of acceptable foods. I’ve found that peo ple typically need at least six weeks to change ingrained habits. Let’s be clear, habits and addictions are hard to break, as anyone who has detoxed or cleansed at a rehab center or sp a for a couple of weeks knows all too well. Yes, yo u will start to feel great in a couple of weeks, but please, don’t be fooled. The bad bugs are still there, marginaliz ed to be sure, but just waiting for a chance to regain their advantage . Please, show them no mercy for a full six weeks. After what they’ve done to you, you need to punish them unmerc ifully, and starve them out of your life. Continue to Plug the Holes What will you be avoiding or omitting to allow your body to heal? • As indicated on the Just Say “No” list, elimina te most high lectin–containing foods, including veg etables in the nightshade family and vegetables with seeds—the exception being avocados—as well as grains, pasta, bread, cereal, crackers, etc. • Omit all out-of-season fruit (except those with resistant starches, the not-yet-ripe fruits on the Say “Yes Please” list, and avocados). Preferably, give all o ther fruit the boot! Modern fruit is as bad as cand y. • Avoid long-chain saturated fats, as well as lim iting olive oil and coconut oil, for the first two weeks to block LPSs from breaching the gut wall. • Consume no more than 4 ounces of all animal pro tein twice a day (for 8 ounces total). For instance , if you have two eggs for breakfast, wait until dinner for the next 4-ounce portion of animal protein. • Who Neu? Consider eating less beef, pork, and l amb to reduce your Neu5Gc intake. This applies to grass-fed animals as well. • Consume only pasture-raised chicken, duck, and turkey. • Try to make wild fish and shellfish a significa nt portion of your protein intake, but avoid any fa rm-raised fish (do not be fooled by claims that it is organic), pa rticularly salmon, tilapia, catfish, or shrimp. • Avoid fish high on the food chain such as sword fish, grouper, tilefish, and sushi-grade tuna, whic h accumulate more mercury and other heavy metals. • Vegetarians and vegans should omit tofu and oth er unfermented soy products. Continue to Feed the Gut Buddies What will you be eating to feed the residents of the condo t hat is you? • Maximize your resistant starch intake to allow your friendly gut bugs to produce short-chain fatty acids and ketones (the fats you can use directly as fuel) tha t you can absorb from your gut (see “ When is a Carb Not a Carb ”). These starches include plantains, taro root, sh irataki noodles, and other nongrain “pastas,” parsn ips, turnips, jicama, celery root, and Jerusalem articho kes (sunchokes), as well as unripe fruits such as g reen"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"turnips, jicama, celery root, and Jerusalem articho kes (sunchokes), as well as unripe fruits such as g reen bananas, mangoes, and papayas. • Eat lots of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), a for m of indigestible (for you) sugar in the form of in ulin and its cousin yacón, on which your gut bugs thrive. These compounds are found in vegetables such as radicchio , Belgian endive, Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes), o kra, artichokes, onions, and garlic. They are also available as powders and in sweeteners such as SweetLeaf and Just Like Sugar. (See “ Your Gut Buddies Get to Eat Sugar .”) • Eat raw or cooked mushrooms, which provide more unique FOS to pamper your gut buddies. • Consume as many leafy green vegetables and vege tables in the cabbage family (crucifers) as possibl e. (See “ The Crucifer Paradox .”) • Increase gram-positive bacteria and their frien ds (the “gut buddies”) by consuming polyphenol comp ounds in pulp from all acceptable fruits. Put your juicer ba ck to work by “reverse juicing.” Juice your fruits, toss the juice (which is where the “candy” lurks), and add t he pulp to a smoothie, or blend it with plain goat, sheep, or coconut yogurt and toss into any salad dressing. • Consume lemon juice and vinegars, including bal samic vinegar from Modena, Italy, which also contai ns polyphenols. • In addition to cooking with the acceptable oils , take a fish oil capsule before each meal. Or mix flavored cod liver oil—I love Carlson’s lemon or orange flavors— with an acceptable oil to dress salads or cooked ve ggies. Vegans and vegetarians can use an algal DHA capsule instead. • Nuts—particularly pistachios, walnuts, macadami as, and pecans, which are full of polyphenols—promo te the growth of “gut buddies.” Nut consumption is also as sociated with reduced risk of overall mortality. 24 You can have ¼ cup of Dr. G.’s New and Improved World-Famous Nut Mix twice daily. • Consume figs (which are technically flowers, no t fruit), and use dates or dried figs as a sweetene r in limited amounts. Both are full of the FOS that boost the gr owth of good gut bugs and overall health. Add figs and dates to salads or toss a couple of dates into a smoothie . I realize that this is a lot to absorb, but let me remind you to do the best you can do with what you have and where you are. See the Say “Yes Please” list for more specifics. If you are unfamiliar with any of these foods, see “ How to Evolve Your Shopping Style ” and “ Tools for Success ” for sources and further explanation. The Crucifer Paradox Although you should eat as many vegetables in the c abbage family (crucifers) as possible, if you have been told or suspect that you have IBS or “leaky gut,” r emember my advice to overcook all crucifers initial ly. When eaten raw or in large quantities, these vegeta bles often cause stomach upset and diarrhea. If you are new to them, increase your intake gradually. Crucif ers, including sauerkraut, activate specialized whi te blood cells in the intestinal lining, and those cells con tain receptors that calm the immune system gone awr y. Compounds in cruciferous veggies thus alert the bor der patrol on your gut wall to calm down and not to shoot anything that moves. These receptors are call ed the Ah receptors. When activated, your immune ce lls say, “Ah.” Now you know why Mom made you eat your b roccoli! Your Gut Buddies Get to Eat Sugar Your gut buddies require indigestible (for you) sug ars for proper growth and function, particularly th e guys that guard and feed the cells that line your gut. T hese indigestible sugars are called prebiotics, not to be"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"that guard and feed the cells that line your gut. T hese indigestible sugars are called prebiotics, not to be confused with probiotics, which are the friendly ba cteria that are the seeds for your new rain forest. Unless you feed probiotics what they need to grow, meaning prebiotics, they will perish. Fructooligosaccharid es (FOS) are a special form of prebiotic, which feed t he gut buddies that live near your gut wall, stimul ating the mucus production that protects you from lectins and LPSs. Want more good news? Many prebiotics contain polyphenols. According to research at the Cleveland Clinic, the polyphenols in fruit pulp also paralyz e certain enzymes in gut bugs, preventing them from c onverting the animal proteins carnitine and choline into an artery-damaging compound called TMAO. 25 Bid Adieu to Gut Busters As well as making the dietary changes above, stop t aking antibiotics if at all possible. Note, however , that you should always check with your health-care provider before doing so. In addition: • Eliminate all stomach-acid-blocking drugs. Inst ead, use antacids such as Rolaids or Tums as necess ary. You will be shocked at how quickly your heartburn will disappear when following this program. You can also take betaine or marshmallow root and chew DGL. (For more information, go to www.DrGundry.com.) • Eliminate NSAIDs and replace with Tylenol, or p referably 5-loxin (boswellia extract). There are se veral good products that contain boswellia such as Now D- Flame and MRM Joint Synergy. (Again, for more information, go to www.DrGundry.com.) Additional Important Supplements I have already advised you to take a fish oil suppl ement before each meal, but let me get a bit more s pecific. In terms of dosage, take the capsule with the highest number of milligrams of DHA you can afford—you’ll n eed about 1000 mg per day. In addition to protecting the lini ng of your gut, fish oil consumption is associated with a bigger hippocampus and overall larger brain size, making i t an important tool in avoiding dementia and other neurological problems associated with aging. 26 I cannot emphasize enough that the vast majority of people are profoundly vitamin D deficient. In my o pinion, vitamin D is the single most important missing ingr edient necessary to restore your gut health and the refore your overall health. It is essential to stimulate the gr owth of enterocyte stem cells, which repair the gut wall that has been damaged by lectins on a daily basis. 27 In my fifteen years of experience as a practitioner of restorative medicine, pushing vitamin D blood levels up to 70 to 100 ng/m l per day is necessary for most people, and may req uire upward of 40,000 IUs a day to achieve. I have absolutely n o qualms keeping my patients’ levels of vitamin D g reater than 100 ml, which is where I keep mine. However, unless a health-care professional is checking your levels , limit yourself to 5000 to 10,000 IUs initially. In addition: • Restore gut flora with targeted probiotics Bacillus coagulans (BC30), available at any drugstore under the trade name Schiff Digestive Advantage, or other pro biotics such as L. reuteri and saccharomyces boulardii , and stomach mucus enhancers like DGL (deglycyrrhizinate d licorice root), slippery elm, and marshmallow roo t. • Repel invaders by rebuilding stomach acid with betaine and grapefruit seed extract. • Repair the gut wall with vitamin D and fish oil , as discussed above, as well as with L-glutamine ( a protein that feeds gut cells), butyric acid from ghee, poly phenols like grape seed extract and pycnogenol, and anthocyanins, the polyphenols in dark berries like blackberries. All are available over the counter. • Reactivate and calm white blood cells in the in testinal lining with the supplements indole-3-carbi nol and DIM, or simply increase your intake of cruciferous veggies. • For recommended doses and a schedule, go to www .DrGundry.com."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"SUCCESS STORY Taming the Relish Jane Y., a fifty-year-old nurse who lives in the Pa cific Northwest, had been troubled by intractable m igraines for most of her life. She had run the gamut of trea tment options without success. Jane sought me out a fter hearing of my successes with other migraine suffere rs, including myself—I know from personal experienc e how awful migraines can be. She immediately started the Plant Paradox Program and within days her migraines abated. She was delighted, but after a fe w months she visited to discuss a dilemma. One of J ane’s passions is canning (and eating) a zucchini and tom ato relish she makes with the vegetables in her gar den. With both fruits now off limits and canning time fa st approaching, she was in a quandary. I suggested that we do a lectin challenge: she should can half of her r elish using her traditional canning method, and the other half using a pressure cooker. Jane returned home de lighted, and a few weeks later she called me. Not surprising, within a few minutes of eating her regu lar canned relish, wham, a migraine struck. But the next day, when she gingerly tasted her pressure-cooked r elish, nothing happened. She ate some more, and, ag ain, nothing. Jane was back in business with her relish! Thanks to her lectin sensitivity, she has gone on to become one of my most cherished lectin testers. Des pite her best efforts with pressure cooking wheat, oats, rye, and barley for an hour (that is a long time in a pressure cooker), she still gets migraines from these grains. Putting It All Together MY PATIENTS HAVE been remarkably successful in constructing a diet that they can live with, literally and figuratively, just by following the two food lists and the above rules. Having said that, a few tips a re in order. • BREAKFAST may seem daunting initially, but it is actually pr etty easy. My wife, Penny, and I have a Green Smoothie nearly every day, unless I am doing intermittent fa sting, which is discussed in the next chapter. Bars from the approved list—certain Quest bars, cer tain Yup bars, the Human Food Bar, and the Adapt Ba r— also all work well. The first two contain 20 grams of animal protein apiece, so the protein content ad ds up quickly. But by far, my patients’ favorite breakfas ts are my muffins, either the cinnamon and flaxseed or the coconut and almond flour variety. Ready in just a couple of minutes in the m icrowave, they can be easily transported to work or school. Try the Perfect Plantain Pancakes on the weekend. Finally, two pastured or omega-3 eggs or ¼ cup of Dr. G.’s New and Improved World-Famous Nut Mix are filling, meaning you can probably skip a morning snack. Got to have yogurt? I prefer plain (unflavored and unsweetened) coconut milk yogurt, but if that is unavailable, plain goat or s heep milk yogurt will do fine. Both are casein A-2, which is good, although they do contain Neu5Gc. • SNACKS . You can have a morning and afternoon snack in thi s phase, at least initially. The advent of single- serving organic guacamole—it contains no peppers—by Wholly Guacamole, available at most Costco stores, has made portable guacamole my go-to snack, if I ne ed one. Buy sliced jicama at Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods to serve as dipping “chips,” or bake up a batch of Paradox Crackers . Alternatively, carry cut-up pieces of romaine lettuce or Napa or Belgian endive in a maso n jar or stainless steel container. Or reach for ¼ cup of my nut mix. Just don’t overdo it on the nut front, sin ce they are notoriously difficult to stop eating. • LUNCH ON THE RUN . This is the meal my patients find the least chall enging to adapt to their new lifestyle. A salad always hits the spot! Carry it w ith you premade, or purchase it at most grocery sto res or a salad bar. Keep in mind that most prepared salad dr essings, even the better ones, are made with toxic oils—and often corn syrup. Carry a portion of balsamic or an other vinegar mixed with extra-virgin olive oil in a small shaker bottle instead. In a restaurant, ask for dre ssing on the side, or simply order olive oil and vi negar. No olive oil? Vinegar and/or lemon juice will do just fine."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"• DINNER . This is where you get to have fun and feed your g ut buddies what they like. That means that animal protein plays a supporting role in your meal s, not the central one with which most of us grew u p. Consider the palm of your hand (don’t include the f ingers) as the size of your protein portion for the night. I would prefer that you choose wild, nonthreatened sm aller fish or wild shellfish. A reliable guide is a vailable at the Monterey Aquarium (www.seafoodwatch.org). Alway s consider incorporating the protein into a salad— think of a Caesar salad topped with grilled or boil ed shrimp—or tossed with shirataki noodles, kelp no odles, Miracle Noodles, Cappello’s fettuccine, or another acceptable form of “pasta.” A spiralizer is a great tool for turning root vegetables into “noodles.” My wife and I share a large mixing bowl of salad every night, regardless of what else we are eating—and several nights a wee k, it is all we have for dinner! Let me assure you, we are never hungry. Vegetarians can use the approved type s of Quorn, a mushroomlike product with a meaty tex ture; hemp “tofu,” available at Whole Foods; or tempeh wi thout grains, found in most grocery stores or healt h food stores. Hilary’s Root Veggie Burger is a delicious product I discovered recently, but avoid the lectin bombs in other veggie burgers at all costs. See the recipes for more suggestions. Get Out of the Dinner Rut I ALWAYS TRY to encourage my patients to rotate vegetable choic es with seasonal availability, but I realize that studies show that most people rotate between five a nd six go-to vegetables. Why not try to buck that t rend? After all, each vegetable has a unique set of phytonutrie nts. Changing them frequently delights your gut bud dies. And mixing things up helps avoid mealtime monotony. Thanks to misguided nutritional advice, dinner is o ften associated with having a starch. But that advi ce rarely if ever includes a certain category of starches that y ou and I should cherish, the resistant starches, ak a soluble fibers. These are tightly bound chains of sugar molecules t hat are nearly impossible for your digestive enzyme s to break down to be absorbed—which is why they are called re sistant. These unabsorbed sugars arrive deep in you r intestines, where your gut buddies are just waiting for their favorite meal! The gut bacteria convert these sugars into short-chain saturated fats that power you and your intestinal cells. And the best news is that the gan g members can’t use these sugars for fuel, so they are starved out. Enjoy that sweet potato, or some turnips, parsnips , or rutabagas, among an array of other choices on the Say “Yes Ple ase” list. Your gut buddies will thank you. After about six weeks, most people really start hit ting their groove. If you are one of them, it is ti me to join me at the next stage of your health journey. However, if you are not ready, you can stay in this phase longe r. In fact, there is really no need to move on. Some o f my patients have taken a year to regrow the rain forest in their gut. You may take even longer. Everybody is differe nt. You may even choose to spend the rest of your h ealthy life in this phase. There are plenty of healthy options available to you, and there’s no need to compare yo urself to other people—this is not a race. That being said, if your • weight returns to normal, • aches and pains alleviate or vanish, • brain fog clears, • persistent gut issues and any autoimmune sympto ms abate, then it is probably time to meet me in the next cha pter."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"9 Phase 3 Reap the Rewards Phase 3 is akin to the harvest, when you enjoy the sustained benefits of the symbiotic relationship be tween what you consider yourself and your holobiome: vitality, wei ght management, and longevity blessed with good hea lth. Think of it this way: Your goal is to die young at a very old age. Once their “inner you,” the gut, is happily stabili zed, most of my patients who initially came to me t o lose weight notice that this desired result is part and parcel of their overall improved health. In other words, i f you are doing everything right, you will return to your appropria te weight, whether you were underweight or overweig ht when you started the Plant Paradox Program. My autoimmun e and arthritis patients revel in their pain-free a nd energized new lives. In fact, all my patients who attain succ ess with the program embrace the fact that it is a lifestyle, not simply a diet. You’ll achieve two things in this lifestyle phase. First, you will ascertain whether your gut has inde ed healed, and that your gut buddies are happy and empowered to ke ep you in continued good health. Second, you can te st whether you can reintroduce certain lectins—but only if tho se gut bugs are happy and only after the minimum of six weeks spent in Phase 2. Don’t feel you have to rush to te st your tolerance for lectins just because forty-tw o days have elapsed. If you prefer, continue to follow the meal plans for Phase 2 . If you are in no hurry to try adding back some formerly problematic lectin foods, you will find me al plans for a Phase 3 Five-Day Modified Vegan Fast you can follow on a monthly basis if you wish. Patience Will Be Rewarded HOW LONG BEYOND the six weeks before you can try to reintroduce so me lectins? When you achieve the goal of ongoing good health depends, of course, on the p articular condition or set of conditions you had wh en you started the Plant Paradox Program. Thanks to the sophistica ted blood tests I run on my patients every three mo nths, I can spot when a patient’s rain forest has been restored and the gang members and their LPSs have vacated t he premises. However, my patients can also usually sense themsel ves when this occurs. So, I’m going to let you deci de when it is time (if ever) to try reintroducing small amounts o f lectin-containing foods into your gut. How do you make that decision? • Have your bowel movements become normal? One te st that many of my successful patients report is th at they no longer need toilet paper. You are reading t hat correctly. Think about it. Do you see your dog using toilet paper? There’s no need with perfectly formed poops. Your great ape cousins don’t need TP either. If ev erything is as it should be, there is no sense of urgency as a result of loose or poorly formed stools to push out lectins or bad bugs. It’s a fascinating test to tell that thin gs are returning to normal. Need I remind you that all illness starts in the gut? • Have your joints stopped hurting? • Has your brain fog cleared? • Has your skin cleared, is your face glowing, an d has any acne disappeared? • Is your energy level over the top? • Do you sleep without restlessness or awakening several times a night? • If you were overweight, are you now wearing a s maller size?

Or, if you were underweight at the sta rt, are you filling out your clothes more? If the answer to any of these questions is no, plea se don’t get antsy and make the mistake of trying t o leave Phase 2 prematurely. You’re not ready yet. Similarly, if you have been diagnosed with an autoi mmune condition, or even suspect that you have one, or if you had your tonsils removed, are hypothyroid, have art hritis or heart disease, have chronic sinus issues, or you see yourself in any of the accounts of my “canaries,” t hose folks who are supersensitive to lectins, I urg e you not to waver in your avoidance of the foods on the Just Sa y “No” list. All too often, I have witnessed the re versal of good fortune as the result of small and seemingly harmle ss missteps. Don’t be in too much of a hurry to exp eriment with your tolerance for foods you have given up for the last month and a half. Fortunately, most of you are not “canaries”! And in this phase, I want to teach you some techniques to ensure that you have a lifestyle you can live with, literally a nd physically. I’m also going to illuminate the tri cks shared by most long-lived societies, along with the cutting-edge r esearch that confirms the principles that you’ll pu t into practice. Despite what you may have heard about the so-called blue zones (see “ What Are the Blue Zones? ”), most of these cultures have striking similarities that escape cur sory inspection. The common misconception is that t hese cultures appear to have very different dietary practices—the stapl e foods differ among them—but, in fact, they all sh are a unifying dietary practice, which I have already men tioned. This universal practice is the restricted c onsumption of animal protein, which I believe is the key to a vib rant health span. As a native of Nebraska, which dubs itself the Beef State, along with its official designation as the Cornhusker State —what do you think those cows eat?—it saddens me to admonish you about this fact. But the truth is tha t animal protein intake is low in all these long-lived socie ties. Animal and (now) human studies validate that long life is associated with eating minimal amounts of meat, pou ltry, and even fish. 1 Finally, I am going to show you that perhaps you ca n have your cake and eat it, too—no, not that kind of cake—by employing the practice commonly referred to as inte rmittent fasting. This involves periodically prolon ging the periods of time between meals, or just restricting protein consumption and overall calories intake a c ertain number of days each month or each week. I am going to take you through this step by step. SUCCESS STORY The Food Chain Up Close and Personal Patrick M., a forty-five-year-old executive from th e midwest with chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, and hypertension, sought my help after he had visited s ome of the finest spas and health centers in Switze rland, all to no avail. Within six weeks of going on the P lant Paradox Program, all his symptoms cleared and he was able to stop his blood pressure medications. He als o felt alert and his arthritis abated, allowing him to resume his active travel schedule. When we spoke by teleph one six months into the program, Patrick noted that he was doing well except when he dined out on the road . Despite eating his safe fall-back foods of chicke n or shrimp, his symptoms returned. He speculated that i t might be because flour, and the gluten it suppose dly contained, had been used in cooking these foods. Wh at he hadn’t grasped was that the chicken or shrimp served in a restaurant had probably been fed corn a nd soybeans, meaning that he was eating what the th ing he was eating ate. Within a month of stopping these “s afe foods,” Patrick reported that he was no longer experiencing any fatigue or pain. The trigger wasn’ t hidden gluten; rather, it was the shrimp and chic ken, which might as well have been corn and soybeans. The Program: Phase 3 UNLIKE THE FIRST two phases, which have a suggested duration, this is really a lifestyle. Staying on this phase"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"UNLIKE THE FIRST two phases, which have a suggested duration, this is really a lifestyle. Staying on this phase indefinitely will greatly enhance your chances of l iving to a ripe old age without being plagued with an array of health issues. You will continue to eat much the wa y you have been eating, and depending upon your tol erance for lectins, you can make some dietary changes. • Continue to eat foods on the Say “Yes Please” list , consuming primarily locally grown foods that have been picked when ripe (meaning in-season produce). • Once your gut is repaired, consume more ketogen ic fats. These are medium-chain saturated fatty aci ds such as MCT oil or coconut oil that kick-start fat burni ng, rather than being stored as fat. • Continue to avoid the Just Say “No” foods . However, if you wish to and can do so, gradually reintroduce small amounts of immature (no seeds or only tiny se eds) lectin-bearing foods such as cucumbers, zucchi ni, and Japanese eggplant to test your tolerance. Try one a t a time for a week before trying another food. • Later, if you can handle these foods, try to in troduce heirloom tomatoes and peppers that have bee n seeded and had the skins removed. Give each a week to see how you do, before introducing another. • Next, try to introduce pressure-cooked legumes in small amounts. Again, do this one week at a time . Hey, there’s no rush—you’ve got the rest of your life, a fter all. • Finally, after you’ve reintroduced the lectin-c ontaining foods and are doing well, you might be ab le to introduce Indian white basmati rice in extreme moderation or other grains and pseudo-grains that have been pressure cooked—with the exception of barley, rye, oats, and wheat, all of which contain gluten. We’ll discuss pressure cooking later in this chapter. • Eat less food overall and have less frequent me als. As you’ll learn in chapter 10, this will give your gut, brain, and mitochondria the chance to rest between doing the work of digestion and energy production, as well as minimize the time that LPSs are loose in your bo dy. • Progressively reduce your animal protein to no more than 2 ounces per day; instead, derive the vas t majority of protein from leaves, certain vegetables, mushroo ms, nuts, and hemp. • Continue to take the supplements recommended in Phase 2. • Periodically, try to fast and restrict your cal oric intake, particularly in the form of animal pro tein. I’ll present some specifics on how to do this later in the chapt er. • Restore daily and seasonal rhythms with exposur e to daylight, ideally for an hour each day, at or near midday.

She also said she had such a seve re allergy to all nuts that she carried an EpiPen o f epinephrine (adrenaline) in case she had an attack after accidentally eating nuts in a restaurant. I e xplained to her that her immune system was so activated by lect ins and LPSs that it was shooting at any foreign pr otein regardless of whether it was friend or foe. She shr ugged her shoulders, nodded, and said, “Sure, just help me lose weight.” She started the Plant Paradox Program . Six months later, she was down thirty pounds, and her diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol problems we re only a memory. However, it was her recent experi ence at a restaurant that caught my attention. Amelia and a girlfriend had a Caesar salad at a hip place in Los Angeles.

When she"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"her eyes were itchy and watering a bit, but she tos sed it off as the result of a lot of dust in the ai r.

But instead of calling her attorne y, my patient bought a bag of pistachios and anothe r of macadamia nuts. She started with tiny bites and wai ted. Nothing happened! More nuts, bigger bites, but still nothing happened. Then a handful of nuts, but still no reaction. She now was eating nuts with abandon! She wanted me to know that she was cured. In fact, thou gh, she wasn’t cured of anything. Her immune system had been reeducated by her gut buddies to chill out , and those nuts were her gut buddies’ friends—and now her friends as well. Testing the Waters BEANS AND OTHER LEGUMES : Even my nonvegetarian and nonvegan patients miss their beans, and as I noted in chapter 6, you can try to reintroduce legu mes as long as you cook them in a modern one-touch pressure cooker. Simply follow the cooking directions that c ome with your machine. Beans are a great source of resistant starches, the sugars that your gut bugs can use, as long as you remove those nasty lectins. When compa red with animal protein, bean protein is associated with gre ater longevity, at least in a head-to-head comparis on between beans and beef. 2 Interestingly, when compared with red meats, eating fish or chicken did not appear to reduce longevity. THE SAFEST GRAIN : Of the four billion people who use rice as their staple grain, most opt for white rice. Rice eaters traditionally have little or no heart diseas e, a fact that I attribute to the lack of wheat ger m agglutinin (WGA) from wheat in their diet. In my opinion, if you are going to add a grain back into your diet, the safe st option is white basmati rice from India—not the American strain. In dian white basmati rice has the most resistant star ch of any variety. You can make the starch even more resistan t by refrigerating rice after cooking, and then reh eating before using it, or making a cold rice salad. That said, i f you have diabetes, prediabetes, or cancer, or if weight loss is your goal, stay away from even this relatively benign gr ain. And do remember sorghum and millet are the onl y grains that contain no lectins, meaning they are safe from the get-go. Only in America NIGHTSHADES : The Italians and French learned two centuries ago to peel and seed tomatoes before eating them or even when cooking with them. Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and other members of the nightshade famil y are the next group of lectin-containing foods to try to rei ntroduce—in limited quantities, of course, and alwa ys peeled and deseeded. Americans have been slower to adopt these techniques to defang the nightshade family. To eas ily peel tomatoes, immerse them in boiling water for about 3 0 seconds. Or pierce tomatoes on a long fork and ro tate them over the flame of your gas burner. Do the same with peppers until they blacken and then place in a pap er bag to cool. The skin will easily peel off. SQUASH : As with tomatoes, peel skin and eliminate the see ds before eating squash. Alternatively, eat baby summer squash. Do not spiralize mature squash unles s you peel and deseed them first. Peel and remove t he seeds of winter squash before cooking as well. Regardless, a lways keep in mind that these are fruits, not veget ables, and long ago our forebears ate them only to gain weight for the winter. A word of warning: The fructose in these fruits, ev en though we call them vegetables, is often enough to initiate weight regain, as a number of my well-meaning patie nts have experienced. If your scale is heading in t he wrong direction after reintroducing these fruits, simply reverse course. Cease and desist eating any food th at stimulates weight gain or makes it difficult to control your a ppetite. The same advice applies to pressure-cooked grains or beans. Remember, there is no human need for these f oods. A two-by-three-inch muscle in your mouth—that ’s right, it’s called your tongue!—should not rule (or ruin) your health."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A Pound of Flesh, No Way! I HAVE MENTIONED the dangers of excessive intake of animal protein earlier, but now it is time to really start the culling process. Two recent human studies have hammered the final nail in the animal protein coffi n, a fact already established in animal studies. 3 Both studies conclude that meat consumption contrib utes to the current epidemic of obesity as much as, if not more than, o ur staggeringly high consumption of sugar does. Yes , you read that correctly. Eating meat makes you as fat as eat ing sugar does! Luckily, no such strong association was found with fish or shellfish consumption. I recommend the se two as the best choices for nonvegans and nonveg etarians. Moreover, red meat contains Neu5Gc, the sugar molec ule linked to both cancer and heart disease. Think about that the next time you Paleo folks reach for that grass- fed steak, hot dog, or slab of bacon. Instead, enjo y some wild salmon or shrimp. The combination of meat and the bread or buns on wh ich it is served at fast food restaurants creates t he perfect storm in a way you would never expect. The simple s ugars in the fries, chips, bun, or bread enter your bloodstream as sugar almost immediately. In fact, a single slic e of whole wheat bread raises your blood sugar high er and faster than four tablespoons of straight sugar. The meat t hat you ate is more slowly digested, entering your bloodstream slightly later. Unfortunately, your cells are full of the sugar from the bun or fries you ate so there is no need for more calories. Little did you know, when this occur s, that protein converts to sugar, which immediatel y turns into fat. What Are the Blue Zones? Journalist Dan Buettner teamed up with National Geographic to visit and research parts of the world where people live the longest, reaching the century mark at ten times the overall rate achieved in the Unite d States. After publishing an article about his findings in t he magazine, Buettner went on to write the best-sel ling book The Blue Zones. And the winners are: the Italian island of Sardini a; Okinawa, Japan; Loma Linda, California (yes, where I once was a professor); the Nicoya Pen insula of Costa Rica; and the Greek island of Ikari a. The key is that all these different dietary styles shar e one thing and one thing only: they dramatically l imit animal protein. Stay tuned as we are going to do a deep di ve into this subject shortly. A Look at the Mediterranean Diet SHARP-EYED READERS WILL notice that two of the blue zones are found on isl ands in the Mediterranean, so perhaps you are thinking you should just eat the Me diterranean diet and not have to give up grains. I know—I love bread, too! It is positively addictive. Sadly, I ha ve to inform you that meta-analysis shows that cere al grains are actually a negative component of this diet, 4 which is countered by vegetables rich in polyphenol s, as well as the olive oil and red wine consumed in the region. In f act, because the lectins in grain bind to joint car tilage, Italians overall have significantly high rates of arthritis; 5 Sardinians have a high proportion of autoimmune dis eases; and my Adventist friends from Loma Linda keep their orthop edic surgery department very busy. Remember, your g oal is longevity with vibrant health, not just limping alo ng for another year on the planet.

When a workup revealed Crohn’s disease, her doctor recomme nded she start immune-suppressing drugs. Shocked that this was her fate at such an early age, she vi sited me at the urging of an actor friend. Laborato ry tests showed classic lectin intolerance and massive infla mmation. Susan started the Plant Paradox Program an d within two weeks, the abdominal pain began to subsi de and her bowel movements became normal. She continued to thrive and returned to her active life . About a year later, she returned to Hungary, wher e, at the urging of her family, she dined on local breads and yogurt, both of which had been forbidden on my pro gram. To her delight, she suffered absolutely no gastric distress. Back in Los Angeles, convinced that she w as cured, she began eating local yogurt and breads. Wi thin days, all her previous problems returned with a vengeance. A quick visit with me confirmed that her immune system was reactivated. How could that be? When she was in her homeland, Susan was eating brea d that had been made with yeast and sourdough cultures, and with wheat that hadn’t been sprayed w ith Roundup. The yeast and sourdough starters ate t he lectins in the wheat. And the milk used to make the yogurt came from casein A-2 cows that had not been feed corn or soybeans with a Roundup chaser. With nothin g to disturb her gut buddies, she was fine. But whe n Susan returned and ate American yogurt and bread, w hat she was eating was totally unlike what she had eaten in Hungary. The bread wasn’t simply bread and the yogurt wasn’t simply yogurt because you are no t just what you eat, but also how what you are eating was prepared and raised. Susan’s story has a happy ending. In this country, she avoids our lethal foods, but when she is in Hun gary, she eats the same foods (which, of course, are not the same at all), and they nourish her and her gut buddies. The Protein Connection STILL DON’T BELIEVE that moderating animal protein intake is the answe r to a long, healthy life? As Simon and Garfunkel sang, “A man hears what he wants to h ear and disregards the rest.” Let’s take a look at the science. With the exception of one rhesus monkey study condu cted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), 6 calorie restriction has been shown to extend life span in a ll animals (including a University of Wisconsin stu dy of rhesus monkeys.) 7 While calorie-restricted monkeys had a better healt h span than did their conventionally fed companions in both studies, monkeys in both groups died at the same age only in the NIA study. The University of Wisconsin, using the same breed, reached the opposite conclusi on, that indeed calorie restriction increased life span. Who was right? When Wisconsin researchers looked at the dat a of the NIA study, they found and reported that al l the NIA animals were calorie-restricted, and the proteins u sed in the two studies might be the real explanatio n of differences, since the University of Wisconsin monkeys ate less protein and more carbs. (Astute readers will note t hat this mimics the habits of the people in blue zones.) Res earchers at St. Louis University, who have followed members of the CR Society International for years—these folks restrict their calories, eating about 20 to 30 perc ent fewer calories than normal—decided to put the animal prot ein hypothesis to yet another test. Despite eating a lot fewer calories, the CR folks h ad IGF-1 levels (see “ Want to Live to Be 100? ”) that were about the same as those of people eating a normal diet. N o wonder those rhesus monkeys of the NIA study didn ’t live longer than their more rotund study mates. The rese archers then recruited vegans and measured their IG F-1 levels, only to find them much lower than those of the calo rie-restricted group. For the ultimate test, severa l CR members were asked to cut their animal protein consumption without changing their total calorie intake. Lo and behold, down went their IGF-1 scores to parallel those of the ve gans. 8 This means that if you want to be in the game—meani ng the game of life—for the long haul, cut down on ani mal protein or cut it out entirely. I recommend no more than 2 ounces a day. Want more than that at a sitting? No problem, just go animal-protein-free for a day or s o and your protein bank account will even out. Want to Live to Be 100?"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"For years I have routinely measured my patients’ le vels of insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1), an eas ily measured marker for aging. 9 Both animal and human studies show that the lower y our IGF-1, the longer you live, and the less chance for developing cancer. Th e two factors in animal and human studies, includin g my own studies, that correlate to lowered IGF-1 are co nsuming less sugar and consuming less animal protei n— specifically, certain amino acids. These amino acid s, particularly methionine, leucine, and isoleucine , which are far more prevalent in animal protein than plant -based proteins, activate the cellular sensor of en ergy availability, mTOR, or just TOR, for “target of rap amycin.” (Rapamycin is a transplant drug that was b eing testing during my early days at Loma Linda Universi ty. Any transplant drug has to undergo years of ani mal testing for both safety and long-term side effects. ) Imagine the researchers’ surprise when animals tr eated with rapamycin had an extended, not a shorter, life span, 10 since most transplant drugs shorten life span! The search for the cause of this phenomenon revealed th at the main driver of longevity is a receptor for e nergy availability on all cells. Researchers, who usually don’t lack fancy names to call things, called the receptor the “mammalian target of rapamycin” or mTor. We now know that the equivalent sensor exists in all livi ng things, even worms, so it is simply called TOR. TOR senses energy availability. If it senses lots o f energy—think food and summer—it is time to grow a nd TOR stimulates cellular growth by activating IGF-1. If TOR senses little energy—think winter, drought, or starvation—it is time to batten down the hatches, c ut back all nonessential functions, and kick any ce ll not pulling its own weight off the island; in that proc ess, therefore, IGF-1 is lowered. While TOR cannot be measured—it is a receptor or sensor—its downstream messenger, IGF-1, tells cells to either grow or go into hibernation and wait for better times. By measuring IGF-1 (and lowering it with our food choices, such as less animal protein), we can manage our rate of agi ng. Scary, but true. My ninety- and hundred-year-ol ds all have very low IGF-1 and so should you. How Low Can You Go? WHERE’S THE BOTTOM in terms of protein consumption? My former colleag ue Dr. Gary Fraser at Loma Linda University probably has the answer. In his st udies of the long-lived Seventh-day Adventists and a meta- analysis of six other studies, he has clearly shown that vegan Adventists live the longest, followed b y vegetarian Adventists who limit dairy fats. 11 Vegetarian Adventists who do consume dairy come nex t, and the Adventists who occasionally eat chicken or fish bring up the rear in terms of longevity. What does this mean for you? It means that eating animal protein is not necessary for good hea lth and that completely avoiding animal protein pro duced the greatest longevity among an already extremely long- lived people. If you are still thinking you can’t d o without lots of burgers, chops, and steaks, consider this: The r isk of developing Alzheimer’s correlates directly w ith the amount of meat consumed. 12 Now just imagine what could happen with a lectin-li mited all-plant diet! As impressive as these studies are, they must be ba lanced against the other masters of longevity in th e blue zones, for whom small amounts of animal protein, particula rly seafood, are an integral part of their diet. Da n Buettner, the author of The Blue Zones, hadn’t heard of the very old residents of the main land Italian town of Acciaroli, located south of Naples. This village has the largest perce ntage of centenarians recorded—30 percent of the to wn’s residents are more than one hundred years old—who a ttribute their remarkable health to eating anchovie s with rosemary every day, and washing it down with genero us amounts of wine. Having said that, my own studie s confirm the connection between the intake of animal protein and sugar (even fruit sugar) and IGF-1 lev els. My advice is to embrace appropriate plants as your pre ferred protein source, maybe throw in some small fi sh and rosemary, and look forward to a long and healthy li fe. Fasting and Ketones"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Fasting is perfectly natural. Ignore “experts” who claim fasting is dangerous. Humans once fasted regu larly, not because it was trendy or they wanted to cleanse their gut, but rather for a more basic reason: foo d was not always available. A study performed in 1972 is inst ructive. Researchers put twenty-three obese subject s on a sixty-day starvation diet. First they were injected with insulin, which removes sugar from the bloodst ream. Immediately all got severe symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), with sweats, low blood pressure , and fainting. At the end of the sixty days, they we re all once more injected with insulin; this time, even though their blood sugar levels were extremely low, they were completely alert and bright. Blood drawn from veins exiting their brains proved that their b rains were burning ketones for energy instead of gl ucose, and therefore did not require glucose. 13 This is proof that humans can adapt to use ketones as a primary fuel when we are without sources of sugar from carbs and protein. 14 Keep in mind that almost all the great religious traditions have some form of fasting as p art of their spiritual practice. Mormons who practi ce a weekly one-day fast live significantly longer than their nonfasting, although also very healthy, Mormo n brethren. 15 An Alternative to Animal Protein Restriction NOT READY TO forgo animal protein completely? Okay, I hear you. What if I told you that there was another way out? Valter Longo of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California has shown th at a monthly five-day modified vegan fast of approximately 900 c alories gives the same results in terms of IGF-1 an d other markers of aging, as does an entire month of a trad itional calorie-restricted diet. 16 Therefore, if you limit calories and avoid animal protein for just five days each mo nth, you get the same benefits as though you joined the CR Society International for the whole month, but with out the effort. It is akin to doing specific exerci ses for one or two days a week and achieving the same physical fitness results as exercising every day (actually, that’s true, too, as research shows 17 ). So, how about it? This next month, just follow the vegan version of the Three-Day Kick-Start Cleanse from Phase 1, which contains about 900 calories, for five days instead of three, and watch what happens. You’ll f ind meal plans for this Five-Day Modified Vegan Fast . My wife and I love this addition to our lifestyle ! You can repeat two days from the Phase 1 cleanse, or make any changes that keep your daily calorie intake in that range. Then follow the Phase 3 Plant Paradox guidelines for the rest of th e month—most people can occasionally depart from th is for a few days while traveling or on a special occasion—and y ou’ve got a program that you can probably live with for a very long, healthy time. Another Alternative IF THAT IS too extreme for you, then try intermittent fasting (IF). The initial IF programs centered on the idea that twice a week you would drastically cut calories to 500 to 600 a day, and then eat normally for the res t of the week. To get an idea of what that looks like, it could be three approved protein bars a day, or six or eight pastured or omega-3 eggs, or five bags of Romaine lettuce with approximately three tablespoons of olive oil plus v inegar (guess which I choose!). In my clinic, I usually advise pa tients to fast on Monday and Thursday. On Monday yo u are coming off the weekend, so cutting back makes easy good sense. After two days off the fast, you cut ba ck again on Thursday so you have the whole weekend to relax aga in. By the way, my patients usually lose about a po und a week using this technique. A Third Option STILL NOT CONVINCED? My colleague and friend Dr. Dale Bredesen, a leadi ng dementia researcher at UCLA and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and I agree that the longer you go between meals, the mo re metabolic flexibility you develop in your mitochondria, the t iny power stations in your cells, especially in the neurons of your"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"flexibility you develop in your mitochondria, the t iny power stations in your cells, especially in the neurons of your brain.

Remember, the meaning of breakfast is “break fast.” The farther you extend this time period, the better. 18 I am not just now jumping on this bandwagon. If you read my first book, you may recall that from January through May of each year, I fast for 22 out of 24 hours each day during the week, ea ting all my calories between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m. and drinking ge nerous amounts of green tea and mint tea, as well a s a cup of coffee in the morning.

An Intensive Care Approach SOME OF THE patients who arrive at my center are on their last gasp, often with physical issues such as severe diabetes, cancer, or kidney failure, or with newly diagnosed dementia or Parkinson’s or other neurolog ical diseases. Such dire cases need intensive care because the ene rgy-producing organelles of their cells, their mito chondria, are in shock. And these folks need to go immediately to Dr . Gundry’s “intensive care unit.” If that describes you, or you have a loved one with one or more of these conditio ns, I’ve designed a modification of the Plant Parad ox Program to deal with these seemingly different conditions. The adaptation is called the Keto Plant Paradox Int ensive Care Program, and it’s detailed in the next chapter. I’l l give you a hint: Such conditions actually all hav e a common cause. And I’ll give you one guess, dear reader, wh at that might be."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"10 The Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program A great number of my patients find me after all els e has failed. Others turn up when they are suddenly confronted with a diagnosis of diabetes, cancer, Parkinson’s d isease, Alzheimer’s disease or another form of deme ntia, or another life-threatening condition. It should come as no surprise that I believe that the underlying m echanism that unleashes all these outcomes is the breakdown of th e intestinal barrier by lectins, in cahoots with th e Seven Deadly Disruptors. As a result, those lectins and the LPSs (the lipopolysaccharides I’ve dubbed little pieces of shit) gain admittance to the body. In terms of dementia and Pa rkinson’s, specialized white blood cells called gli al cells protect neurons (nerve cells) like bodyguards or handlers. When they detect lectins or LPSs nearby, they crowd around the neurons that they are pledged to protect, kind of l ike circling the wagons in the old western movies o r pulling up the drawbridges from the moat surrounding the castle. S adly, these glial cells protect the nerve so well t hat even simple nourishment can’t get to the nerve cell and the ner ves die. Moreover, lectins and LPSs on the loose se t in motion a fundamental metabolic derangement in how mitochondr ia, the energy-producing factories in all cells, pr ocess sugars and fats. Read on to see how this happens. The Mighty Mitochondria AS A CHILD of the 1950s and 1960s, I can’t help but think of mitochondria as Mighty Mouse and millions of his clones—that’s because they really do come to save t he day, every day. Hundreds of millions of years ag o, the precursors of all living cells engulfed bacteria th at became our mitochondria. These mitochondria deve loped a symbiotic relationship with their host cells and st ayed on to produce the energy-generating molecule c alled ATP that all cells need to function. Mitochondria—or Mi ghty Mice, if you will—actually have their own DNA, which divide at the same time their host cells divide. Mi tochondria shoulder the workload of handling the ca lories you consume, using sugars and fats to produce ATP in an assembly line called the Krebs cycle. Like any wor kers, mitochondria can do only so much work in a day and need a little downtime now and then to catch their breath. Until recently, the circadian clock worked well for Mighty Mice. During the day, they worked nonstop, turning all the sugar and protein (which itself turns to sugar) you ate into ATP. Then at night, your mitochondria slowed down, cut back, and maybe even caught a few z’s while the boss slept. The mitochondria’s metabolic duties do not grind to a halt at night, but they do shift to a slow burn i n the absence of sugar and protein intake, relying instead on a special form of fat called ketones. As I explained in chapter 9, ketones are normally generated from f at cells when sugar supplies are low. Compare this system to a hy brid car, which runs on gas and gets a battery rech arge from the engine while running. It stores this electrical ene rgy to draw on once the gas is gone or the engine i s off. Likewise, at night, when you are not eating, mitochondria dra w on your “battery” power in the form of ketones to create ATP. We’ve discussed the impact of circadian rhythms on your metabolism earlier. In the summer, when food i s plentiful, the mitochondria probably have to put in some overt ime, and perhaps they even occasionally refuse entr y to the delivery vans bringing in sugar and protein and dum ping some fat in a landfill (your belly). Not that long ago, that would not have normally been a problem. Why? Becaus e come winter, Mighty Mouse and his look-alikes cou ld slow down since the boss was taking time off and no t eating much, so fat could be used to make ATP in lieu of sugar. Sending some fat in ketones to mitochondria during periods of food scarcity is just what the do ctor ordered: It takes only half the effort to turn ketones into ATP than it does with sugar, which makes the worker s happy and conserves the body’s stores of energy in times of n eed! A Mitochondrial Mix-up"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"BUT WHAT HAPPENS when Mighty Mouse and team are chronically overwor ked trying to handle that huge number of calories you eat, day in, day out, 24/7, 365 days a year? Stressed out and underappreciated, they start calling in sick and refuse to shoulder that extra w orkload. The power grid (ATP production by mitochon dria) is strained and rolling blackouts start to dim the lig hts. The trucks that deliver sugar have now nowhere to go and instead dump more of their cargo (fat) into the lan dfill. When your mitochondria are under this kind o f strain, your energy sputters to a stop. Your brain—think of it a s upper-level management—has no idea what is going on down on the factory floor and angrily keeps telling the workers (mitochondria) to produce or find more suga r to turn into energy—on the double. That’s because your brain is starving to death from an energy deficit. Now think of your immune system as cops. Because there is no energy t o pay them, they cut back on patrols. With the ligh ts down low and the cops nowhere in sight, the criminal element —in the form of cancer cells, for example—moves in, happy to use all that sugar that’s lying around, free for th e taking. This scenario doesn’t sound like any comi c book I’ve ever read, but it does have the awful ring of familiarit y. Happily, however, it is not a hopeless situation . By now, you probably have a pretty good idea of why this sad state of affairs occurred. Be patient wit h me while I explain how my plan will extricate you. It requires a quick lesson in enzymes. When you eat sugar or p rotein— remember protein is the “new sugar” and is converte d to sugar 1 —your pancreas squirts out insulin to usher sugar into the mitochondrial factories. However, if the f actories are running at full tilt, insulin and its sugar cargo are turned away at the receiving dock. Instead, insulin instructs an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase to m ake fat cells turn sugar into more fat to store for later use. If you continue to eat sugar or protein—or if you hav e been eating lectins, which also block the loading docks—your po or pancreas keeps making more and more insulin to f erry all that cargo around and get it converted to fat. This is called insulin resistance, but in reality, Migh ty Mouse and team have gone on a work slowdown, or even on strike, to protest the unfair working conditions. At their core, all the various diseases cited at th e opening of the chapter involve a metabolic derang ement, a mismatch between energy consumed and the ability of your workers (Mighty Mouse) to handle it, caused b y the overconsumption of energy (food), primarily in the form of sugars and protein. Toss in saturated fats that transport LPSs into you, and lectins that release more LPSs, and it’s no wonder the workers are on strike! SUCCESS STORY ALS Stopped in Its Tracks I met Art S. four years ago, when he drove his moto rized wheelchair into my exam room. At sixty-five, he was in the final stages of ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, the condition recently made famo us by the Ice Bucket Challenge. Art was completely paraly zed except for two fingers on his right hand with w hich he operated the wheelchair controls. Bright and ale rt, with a loving wife and kids, he had been told t hat he would need a tracheostomy and a ventilator in order to continue to live. By wheeling himself in to see me, Art chose another path. Four years later, as a prac titioner and evangelist of my Keto Plant Paradox Pr ogram, he still steers his wheelchair through Costco, stil l uses his two fingers, and still breathes on his o wn without a tracheostomy or ventilator. If you know anything ab out the progression of ALS, you know that what you just read is supposed to be impossible. In fact, it’s no t impossible, as Art will gladly tell anyone who wi ll listen to his still strong voice. The Ketone Conundrum SO WHY NOT just cut way back on sugar and protein and take th e workload off your mitochondria by simply burning all that stored fat as fuel? Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. If you ever did the Atkins die t, you’ll remember that Dr. Atkins wanted everyone to get into ketosis , which he believed would burn stored body fat. But , alas, your mitochondria cannot process fat directly from your fat cells. Instead, an enzyme called hormone-sensit ive lipase has"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"mitochondria cannot process fat directly from your fat cells. Instead, an enzyme called hormone-sensit ive lipase has to turn your stored fat into a usable form of fat c alled a ketone. Your body works in elegant ways. Insulin is the sin gle hormone to which this enzyme is sensitive. So, if your insulin level is high, your brain assumes that you must be chowing down for the coming winter, convert ing everything you eat into fat to tide you over when p ickings are slim. And it assumes that the last thin g you want to do right then is convert that fat into ketones. So, in sulin keeps hormone-sensitive lipase from working. On the other hand, if it’s winter and you’re not ea ting much, hormone-sensitive lipase is unblocked be cause there is no insulin being produced—and away you go, making k etones to send to Mighty Mouse et al. Once upon a t ime, this ketone backup fuel kept humans alive during ti mes when food was in short supply. But we no longer have to scrounge for food in the winter. If you eat 365 day s a year as though it is endless summer, your insul in level stays high, the workers are on strike, and you can’t acce ss all that stored fat because high insulin is bloc king hormone- sensitive lipase. Think water, water everywhere, an d not a drop to drink! And this is exactly the scenario that halts a lot o f followers of low-carb, high-protein diets, such a s Atkins, South Beach, Protein Power, and Paleo. Even cutting out s ugar does not diminish insulin levels, because of a ll that protein. Again, the excess protein morphs into sugar and res ults in insulin release, which blocks the action of the hormone- sensitive lipase, preventing fat from converting to ketones. The side effects of this blockage typical ly manifest as headaches, low energy, aches, and the so-called Atk ins or low-carb flu. To be clear, you have to cut o ut not only sugars but also proteins to stop this process. Real ly? Both? Fat chance of that happening, you say. In fact, you are right. Fat will give you a chance! Eating Fat Is the Key to Unlocking Fat Storage SO HOW DO we fix this? As you probably suspected, given the title of this chapter, it involves ketones. Contrar y to those low-carb, high-protein diets, you have to dramatically drop both sources of insulin-raising calories—sugar and protein—to get insulin levels to drop and to re duce the workload on your poor mitochondria. But ho w do you get ketones into those tiny powerhouses when your b ody can’t make them? Thankfully, there’s a way arou nd this roadblock, without the suffering involved with the “low-carb flu.” Like the old expression, if you can ’t beat them, join them. As you learned earlier, most of us eatin g the standard American diet have so much insulin c urrently blocking ketone production that producing our own k etones from our fat is really difficult. But plants have given us a break, another paradox. Luckily, you can eat or d rink ketones that plants have already made for you. Several plant fats are composed of ketones, and paradoxically, de spite being fats from plants, they can help you out of this mess. Medium-chain triglycerides (found in MCT oil) are 1 00 percent composed of ketones, which can plug dire ctly into the Krebs cycle without any help from insulin. Soli d coconut oil (meaning it is solid below about 70 d egrees) contains about 65 percent MCTs, making it another s ource of ketones. Another source of MCTs is red pal m oil, also known as palm fruit oil, which is made of about 50 percent ketones. Butyrate, named for the ketone in butter, is the short-chain fatty acid in butter, goat butter, and ghee (clarified butter), and it’s yet another small source of ketones. This gives us a lot of choices right off the bat. But let me remind you: Protein is every bit as much your enemy as are sugar and carbohydrates. (Talk a bout paradoxes!) That is why many well-meaning ketogenic dieters will never get into and maintain ketosis—t hey make the mistake of taking their good MCT fats while sti ll eating a generous dollop of animal protein in th e form of bacon, spareribs, beef, sausages, cold cuts, and ot her fatty meats, as well as high-fat cheeses. Pleas e understand that you can swallow ketones all day but, as long as you keep eating animal proteins (which keep your insul in levels high), you will never get to the point of breaking down your own fat into ketones, which promotes weig ht loss. Moreover, for those of you who have cancer, let me remind you that cancer cells love animal products. See “ The Anti-Aging Approach ” for a refresher course on Neu5Gc and cancer. The Cancer Connection—and More"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"LET’S TAKE A moment to thank Nobel Prize–winning German physici an Otto Warburg, who in the 1930s discovered the Achilles’ heel of all cancer cell me tabolism. Unlike in normal cells, the mitochondria in cancer cells are unable to use ketones to generate ATP. Nor do t hey choose to combine sugar with oxygen to generate ATP, the way normal cells act. Instead, cancer cell mitochon dria rely on the extremely inefficient system of su gar fermentation also used by yeasts and bacteria. This means that the average cancer cell needs up to eig hteen times more sugar to grow and divide than do normal cells! 2 That’s not all. Cancer cells prefer to ferment suga r in the form of fructose rather than glucose, so there’s another reason to give fruit the boot (and you will do tha t almost completely with this plan). 3 If you or someone you love has cancer, we are going to starve those guys out of existence. SUCCESS STORY Diabetes and Cancer Have Disappeared Melinda Y., a new seventy-seven-year-old patient, h ad diabetes, which was in itself serious, but her b igger problem was the large squamous cell cancers on both her legs. The tumors were too large for surgery an d chemotherapy is notoriously ineffective for lesions this large. She had heard in online chat rooms tha t all would not be lost if she followed what I had sugges ted for other cancer patients. She flew into Palm S prings for a visit. I immediately placed her on the Keto P lant Paradox Intensive Care Program. Within six mon ths, not only did her diabetes disappear, but her cancer s also completely resolved. It’s an amazing but tru e story about the power of this program! While we are starving cancer cells, every other cel l in your body, including your brain, can also use ketones to power Mighty Mouse and his clones. As a cardiac sur geon, I know that heart cells much prefer ketones t o glucose for everyday energy use or when under intense perfo rmance challenges, such as running a marathon. If you are experiencing memory loss, Parkinson’s, o r neuropathy, exciting research suggests that the e xhausted Mighty Mice in your nerve cells can come back to li fe if they are fed ketones instead of sugar. 4 SUCCESS STORY Slim, but Still Diabetic As a fifty-five-year-old dentist, Ralph K. was a he alth-care provider, but his own health was poor, th rough no fault of his own. Although he was slim, his type 1 diabetes made him dependent on insulin and had caus ed diabetic heart disease. He had already suffered a h eart attack and had had stents implanted. Despite t aking high doses of statin drugs, his cholesterol numbers were terrible. Ralph’s prognosis was not good when he was referred to me. However, all that changed once he adopted the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program. His diabetes markers are now normal, his i nsulin requirements have fallen dramatically, he is off statins, and all his cholesterol numbers have been in the normal range for three years. Diabetes and Kidney Failure Are Curable IF YOU HAVE diabetes, let me reiterate that ketones do not need insulin to be delivered to your mitochondria. They get a free pass! Unlike everything you have al most certainly been told by your diabetic educator, fat is your friend. Say it with gusto: “Fat is my friend!” Anot her important thing you should understand is that p rotein, carbs, and fruit are your enemies and fat and ketones are your friends. 5 In contrast to the teachings of nutritionists who deal with the condition, diabetes is just a metabol ic derangement brought about by too much protein, s ugar, and"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"deal with the condition, diabetes is just a metabol ic derangement brought about by too much protein, s ugar, and fruit overworking your poor mitochondria. Diabetes is completely curable, a fact I see every single da y. Speaking of fruit, fructose is one of the leading c auses of kidney failure, one that you and your doct or, even your nephrologist, are almost certainly unaware of. Fruc tose is such a toxin that 60 percent of it is shunt ed toward the liver, where it is converted to the form of fat cal led triglycerides (which causes heart disease) and to uric acid, which raises blood pressure, causes gout, and directly da mages your kidneys’ filtration system. 6 Thirty percent of fructose that you consume doesn’t go to your liver but heads right to your kidneys, where it causes a more dire ct insult to their filtering system. 7 Remember, fruit is candy, toxic candy. As we’ve lea rned, fruit was good for one thing long ago and that was to fatten you for winter. We could tolerate its toxicity for a few months in exchange for fat, because during the other nine months, we could reco ver from the onslaught to our kidneys. But now your kidneys receive 365 days of direct insult with no break in sight. To be clear, with the Keto Plant Paradox Int ensive Care Program, you will immediately eliminate the vast ma jority of toxins that are killing your kidneys—name ly, lectins, fruits, and excessive amounts of animal protein. SUCCESS STORY Kidney Failure Averted When I met him at the age of eighty-one, Jerome M. was HIV-positive and in end-stage kidney failure as a result of an autoimmune disease called glomerulonep hritis. This disease causes inflammation of the fil tering system in the kidneys, known as glomeruli, which re move waste and excess fluid. He was taking high dos es of the steroid prednisone and was scheduled for dia lysis. Jerome agreed to go on the ketogenic version of the Plant Paradox Program. After ten months, he was abl e to stop the prednisone. In that time, his creatin ine level dropped from 1.7 to 1.1 (1.0 is normal), and his cystatin C level, a high-tech kidney function t est, dropped from 1.84 to 1.04 (normal is 0.97). His GFR (glomerular filtration rate) also improved, going from 40 to 65, which is in the safe zone. He has now bee n off the prednisone for two years and never did ne ed dialysis. Spare the Kidneys The best example of ketosis in action is a pregnant hibernating bear. She enters her den pregnant but doesn’t eat or drink for five months. During that time, she gestat es her young, gives birth, suckles her cubs, and em erges from the den skinny but with all her muscle mass intact. If she didn’t spare her muscles, she couldn’t hunt for food for her cubs. But the most amazing feat of all is that she doesn’t urinate for five months. How does she do al l this? She lives on the ketones from the fat that she stored f or the winter. Now, kidneys have really only two jo bs to do: get rid of water that you drink or consume in foods, and fi lter out protein waste by-products. Like diesel fue l, protein burns dirty; ketones, on the other hand, burn clean, like natural gas. Mama Bear burns ketones and drinks no thing, so her kidneys have nothing to do, and therefore she has n othing to urinate. The kidney-sparing effect of the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program never ceases to amaze me. I even kept my elderly Yorkshire terrier alive after she was se nt home from the vet, who said that she would be de ad within the month with kidney failure and to simply keep her co mfortable. Boy, did I keep her comfortable! She wen t on the raw pancetta diet—dogs are carnivores, after all. B y eating only the profoundly fatty Italian bacon, p erfect for carnivores, but less so for humans, her edema and a scites (water in the abdomen) disappeared, and she rejoined our other three dogs and me on our morning jog. She liv ed two more years, dying at a normal ripe old age. SUCCESS STORY"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"No Need for Dialysis At sixty-one, Guadalupe O. was obese, severely insu lin-resistant, and in diabetic renal failure. She w as scheduled for shunt placement and dialysis. Her dau ghter, who is a manicurist at the salon that cuts m y hair —a shout-out to Tracy!—had heard about what I was d oing in my clinic, so she brought her mother, who speaks no English, to see me. Guadalupe’s diabetes was out of control, with an HbA1C of 12 (normal is less than 5.6) and her kidney function was nearing a GFR of 10 (safe is greater than 90). No wonder she was about to be put on dialysis. The poisons in her blo od were at enormous levels. She immediately started the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program. That was three years ago and Maria remains off dialysis to this day. Her HbA1c has dropped to as low as 5.8, but us ually runs around 6.0 without insulin shots.

The Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program in Pr actice AS YOU CAN see, these very outwardly different health conditi ons all stem from a single and correctable cause of mitochondrial dysfunction. If you have such a condi tion, instead of the basic Plant Paradox Program, I strongly advise you to follow this variation, which further significantly reduces animal proteins and completel y forbids fruits and seeded veggies (which are fruits)."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" What You’ll Eat THE SAY “YES PLEASE” list for the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Pro gram eliminates almost all fruits, except those that are listed as resistant starches. All other fruits move to the Just Say “No” list. T his is the main change, and everything else remains nearly the same as the basic program. Consume absolutely no fruit except for avocados, green bananas and plantains, green mangos , and green papayas. (Okay, nitpickers, okra is fin e, too. It is technically a fruit, but that mucusy stuff that man y people hate binds lectins like a magnet.) As far as fats go, initially concentrate on medium-chain fatty acids o r the short-chain fatty acids in butter or ghee, bu t a word of warning: Too much coconut oil or MCT oil in too sho rt a time can give you diarrhea. As a starting point, aim for about 3 tablespoons sp read out across the day and work your way up to wha t your system can tolerate. See Meal plans for the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Car e Program . All Phase 1 and Phase 2 recipes are appropriate for this ketogenic program. A Few More Specifics • Macadamias become the preferred nut, with other nuts taking a supporting role. • The sugar-free coconut milk frozen dessert rema ins, but the goat ice cream is now a no-no. • You can still treat yourself to extra dark choc olate, but be sure it contains at least 90 percent cacao. Lindt makes such a bar, which is widely available. • Animal protein sources drop to no more than 4 o unces—the size of a deck of cards—a day, preferably in the form of wild fish, shellfish, and mollusks. • If you have cancer, try eliminating animal prot eins altogether. They contain a greater concentrati on of the amino acids that cancer cells use than do plant sou rces of protein.

Hemp seeds are a good source of fat and plant protein. Walnuts have the highest plant prote in content of the nut choices. 9 • Greens, other acceptable vegetables, and resist ant starches take on the role of being fat-delivery devices. I often tell my Keto Plant Paradox patients that the only purpose of food is to get fat into their mouth s. For example, broccoli enables you to consume perilla oi l, MCT oil, ghee, or any of the other approved oils . One of my favorite dishes is to simmer cauliflower in cann ed coconut cream, available at Trader Joe’s, with c urry powder and eat it with a spoon. Drench, and I do me an drench, your salads with olive oil, perilla oil, macadamia nut oil, or better yet, mix olive oil or these othe r oils with MCT oil in a one-to-one ratio. MCTs are flavorless, making them a perfect addition to smoothies. Boost Fat Burning INTERMITTENT FASTING OR stretching out the length between meals is especia lly effective early in the Keto Plant Paradox Program, since taking the load off yo ur stressed-out mitochondria is one of your princip al goals. But unlike people on the conventional Plant Paradox Pro gram, you folks don’t yet have the metabolic flexib ility to access and use all that fat you have stored between meals. Instead, when you are not eating you should supplement every few hours with a tablespoon of MCT oil or coc onut oil; otherwise, you may experience brain fog, feel weak, or get dizzy. Artisana, Kelapo, Carrington Farms, a nd Spectrum all offer single-serving packets of coc onut oil, which makes it easy to get your shots if you are on the go. Another good alternative is to have an Ada pt bar. After a month or two, try eliminating one dose of coconut o il. If you feel fine, start to stretch out the time between meals. A Diet for Life HOW LONG SHOULD you follow the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care P rogram? The answer varies, depending on the condition that prompted its use. I f you have cancer or neurological or memory issues, stay on it for the rest of your (longer and better) life. If y ou have been addressing issues of obesity, diabetes , or kidney failure and have succeeded in achieving improved health, th e good news is that after two or three months, you may be able to switch to the regular Plant Paradox Program. Sta rt with Phase 2, addressed in chapter 9. On the oth er hand, if you go off the rails when you switch to this more liber al version of the program, return to the Keto progr am ASAP. A few words of parting: As I’ve said before, none o f the phases of the Plant Paradox Program or this v ariation should be considered a race to the finish. The obje ct is not to get through the program as quickly as possible. Rather than a competition, regard the program as a path to a lifestyle you can live with, a lifestyle that is life- and health- affirming. Always do what you can do, with what you ’ve got, wherever you are. If you fall off the wago n for a day or two, simply climb back on. Once you have experie nced the health enhancements the Plant Paradox Prog ram (in either form) offers, why would you do anything else ?

SUCCESS STORY He Beat Cancer Twice A single parent with three lovely children, Earl F. is fifty-three and HIV-positive. He first came to see me ten years ago, but I did not see him again for four yea rs, when he reappeared, looking sheepish.

He had also gained twenty pounds in the inter val. Could I help him beat the cancer? Earl went on the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program, eating generous amounts of flaxseeds, and supplementing wi th the Brassica tea patented by Johns Hopkins. Two months later, a much slimmer Earl’s repeat biopsies showed no prostate cancer. He thanked me, and like before, disappeared, canceling his scheduled appoin tments. Three years later, he suddenly surfaced again, look ing sheepish and with a large healing incision on h is scalp. He had recently undergone extensive neurosurgery to remove part of a huge glioblastoma multiforme, one of the most feared forms of brain cancer. Unfortunatel y, the tumor’s location was such that not all of it could be removed. Earl was receiving both chemo and radiatio n therapy, but his research had convinced him that things looked bleak. Could I help again? Luckily, h e was an old hand at the Keto Plant Paradox Program , and we dove right in. We upped his vitamin D levels, to above 110 ng/ml, and added additional cancer-arres ting supplements. Once we saw that he was making progres s with the diet and his lab results, Earl scheduled his next appointment. But as before, he disappeared. Then, two and a half years after his surgery, he walked back into the o ffice bearing CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans of his brain, all of which showed no tumor and only scar tissue. He also brought a picture of his three kids to show me how they were growing, and announced that they all were going to hike around Europe for the summer. The Ket o Plant Paradox Program had returned their dad to them—twice. I sure hope those kids make Dad eat a l ot of olive oil over there! SUCCESS STORY Dementia Slowed George P. was eighty-five when his son moved his wi fe and him to Palm Springs from their home in Flori da, after George was diagnosed with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. The relocation had not gone we ll. When a person with dementia is removed from his fam iliar surroundings, the dementia almost always worsens, as was the case with George, and he began wandering at night. The family was living on a tigh t budget, so a twenty-four-hour care or a memory care facility was not in the cards. After his son broug ht George to see me, testing revealed the presence of the ApoE4 genotype, commonly called the Alzheimer’s gene. He also had high insulin levels and sugar lev els, typical of people with George’s condition. His poor brain was starving for sugar. The entire family went on the Keto Plant Paradox In tensive Care Program and I added some brain-enhanci ng supplements for George. Within a couple of months, he stopped wandering at night. A few more months an d he was engaging his son and wife in conversations a nd jokes, just as he had years earlier. I saw Georg e every three months like clockwork for his new blood work, often drawing his blood myself to have more time t o assess his status. About a year after his first app ointment, I walked into my exam room to draw George ’s blood. On this day, his son and wife, who were alwa ys with him, were nowhere in sight. “Where’s your family?” I asked. “Home,” he replied. “Well, did so meone drive you here?” I asked. “No,” he replied, “ I drove myself.” The shocked look on my face must hav e surprised him. Getting up from his chair, he put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Look, I’ve been comi ng here every few months for over a year now. Don’t you think I’d remember the way by now?” If I ever n eeded reassurance of my faith in the power of food, his question said it all."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"11 Plant Paradox Supplement Recommendations About twenty years ago, I used to tell my patients that supplements made expensive urine. That was bef ore I started measuring the effects of vitamins, minerals, and pl ant compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and other phytonutrients in my patients’ biomarkers of inflam mation. I also perform actual measurements of each patient’s vascular flexibility, using an Endopat device, an F DA-approved system that measures the ability of blo od vessels in the arm to respond positively with increased blood flow following a brief period of blood flow restric tion. I can now reliably tell when patients have changed their supp lement regimen or even changed brands, based upon t hese tests. 1 Let me tell you why nutrient supplementation is a c ritical component of the Plant Paradox Program. I c an choose no better source to convince you of that than the Unit ed States federal government. Here is the actual wo rding in U. S. Senate Document 74–264: “ The alarming fact is that foods—fruits, vegetables and grains—now being raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contain s enough of certain needed nutrients, are starving us—no matter how much we eat of them.” 2 When I lecture on this subject to health-care profe ssionals, I always ask them to guess the date of th is document’s release, so I’ll do the same with you. A hint: this is not new information. How about it? Was the repo rt issued in 2000? 1990? 1960? Not even close. It was written in 1936! Eighty-one years ago. Even then, scientists knew that our soil had been depleted of vitamins, minerals, a nd its own microbiome. And that was in the days bef ore the use of petrochemical fertilizers, pesticides, biocides, and Roundup. The mind boggles at what our soil con tains now (and what it doesn’t contain). And we know for a fa ct that it’s worse, as detailed in a 2003 report co mparing the mineral content of vegetables and fruits from 1940 to 1991. 3 Why is this so important to you and your health? Th e reason my program is called the Plant Paradox Pro gram is that plants are both our bane and our salvation. Ou r ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors consumed more t han 250 different plants annually on a rotating, seasonal b asis. Those plants’ roots delved deep into six feet of organic loam soil, teeming with bacteria and fungi to create an amazing terroir of minerals and phytochemicals within the plants’ tubers, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The meat and f at from the animals that our forebears killed and a te also contained these phytochemicals, because the animals they ate also ate those plants. Let’s say that you eat an organic diet, you eat sea sonally, you frequent your farmers’ market, and you consume wild seafood, pastured chicken and eggs, and grass-fed m eats and cheeses from A-2 cows, as well as from she ep and goats. These are all great habits. Isn’t that enoug h? Well, if you think that by doing so, you can get all the phytonutrients that our ancestors ingested from 250 different plant species, perhaps you would be inte rested in buying the Brooklyn Bridge! As the lab tests on man y of my patients who are faithful organic eaters sh ow, getting all of the nutrients you need simply cannot be done without supplements. What are the supplements in which most people are d eficient, and how do you replace them? Vitamin D 3 AS I MENTIONED previously, the biggest shock to me is that most A mericans have very low levels of vitamin D 3 . 4 About 80 percent of the Californians in my practice were vitamin D deficient when they first enrolled, including 100 percent of my autoimmune and lectin-i ntolerant patients. I have been shocked by how much supplementation some of my autoimmune patients need to get their vitamin D blood levels up to what I c onsider normal, which is 70 to 105 ng/ml for serum 25-hydro xyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D in your b ody. Because I measure vitamin D levels every three mont hs, I can be aggressive with replacement, but if yo u are just beginning this program, please add just 5000 IUs of vitamin D 3 daily. For autoimmune disease, start with 10,000 a"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"beginning this program, please add just 5000 IUs of vitamin D 3 daily. For autoimmune disease, start with 10,000 a day. In the last seventeen years, I have yet to see a case of vitamin D toxicity. In fact, I doubt tha t it exists. The B Vitamins, Especially Methylfolate and Methylc obalamin MANY OF THE B vitamins are produced by gut bacteria, so if your gut rain forest has been decimated, it is likely that you are deficient in both methylfolate (the ac tive form of folic acid) and methylcobalamin (the a ctive form of vitamin B 12 , sometimes called methyl B 12 ). Moreover, more than half of the world’s populati on has one or more mutations of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductas e (MTHFR) genes, which limits their ability to make the active forms of both vitamins. Many people, including myse lf, call the MTHFR mutation the Mother F’er gene th anks to how the acronym looks—but if you were to say it out loud on network television, you would be bleeped. Visit MTHFR discussion websites and you will hear people blaming a long list of health problems on this gene . The good news is that by swallowing a methylfolate 1000 mcg tablet each day and putting a 1000 to 5000 mcg meth yl B 12 under your tongue, you can bypass the genetic mutat ion. Since you have about a 50 percent chance of ca rrying one or more of these single or double mutations, I thin k it is worth taking the active forms of methylfola te and methyl B 12 just in case. Although they will not hurt you, if you are one of the few with one or both of the doub le mutations, you may notice increased excitability or conversely depression. Visit my website (www.DrGundry.com) fo r more information on how to proceed should this happen. Why should you take these B vitamin supplements? Si mply put, they contribute a methyl group to an amin o acid called homocysteine in your bloodstream and convert it to a harmless substance. An elevated homocystei ne level is correlated with damage to the inner lining of your blood vessels that is on a par with elevated choles terol levels. The B vitamin supplements almost always lower these levels to within normal range. The G6 YEARS AGO, WHEN Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution was first published, I was asked to name the six m ost important classes of supplements that I felt everyo ne should have in their armamentarium for great hea lth. We termed this the G6, in reference to the meeting of heads of state (now expanded to the G7) to determin e the future course of the world (and in reference to the first letter of my last name). Here is my G6 list: Polyphenols Perhaps the most important class of compounds missi ng from your diet is the plant phytochemicals calle d polyphenols. Plants design these compounds to resis t insects and protect against sunburn (yes, fruit g ets sunburned), so polyphenols provide you with a host of beneficia l effects when metabolized by your gut bacteria. Th ese benefits include blocking the formation of the atheroscleros is-causing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from the a nimal proteins carnitine and choline, and, as I mentioned above, actively dilating your blood vessels. These compounds are so important that I formulated my own blend cal led Vital Reds, available at www.GundryMD.com. The product combines thirty-four different polyphenols, as well as my favorite probiotic, BG30, into a powder that mixes easily with water. It took me years of painstaking researc h to design this product and there is nothing else like it. However, as all my patients know, I don’t even sell my own products in my offices, choosing instead to point out alternative sources of polyphenols. Some of my favo rite polyphenols in supplement form are grape seed extract, pine tree bark extract (sometimes marketed as pycno genol), and resveratrol, the polyphenol in red wine . You can find supplements at Costco, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foo ds, and online. My suggested doses are 100 mg of bo th grape seed extract and resveratrol, and 25 to 100 mg of p ine tree bark extract a day. Other great additions are green tea extract, berberine, cocoa powder, cinnamon, mulberr y, and pomegranate, all of which (and many more) ar e in Vital Reds, but can also be taken separately. Green Plant Phytochemicals"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Without a doubt, you cannot eat enough greens to sa tisfy your gut buddies, a fact that you will soon w itness for yourself, when your cravings for greens will increa se exponentially in the coming weeks on the Plant P aradox Program. An additional benefit of these greens is t hat they tend to suppress your appetite for the bad stuff that makes us fat. Studies have shown, for instance, tha t the phytochemicals in spinach dramatically reduce hunger for simple sugars and fats in humans, 5 which is one reason that it is a key ingredient in the Green Smoothie , which I usually have for breakfast. Spinach is an ingredien t in a lot of the greens blend powders on the marke t, but a word of warning about these phytochemical powders. I hav e not been able to find a greens blend without whea tgrass, barley grass, or oat grass as an ingredient—and lec tins in grains and grasses are the last things you need to swallow. Last year I finally designed my own green formula c alled GundryMD Primal Plants, combining spinach ext ract along with eleven other superfood greens, particula rly DIM (diindolylmethane), a remarkable immune-sti mulating compound found in only minute amounts in broccoli. My blend also includes modified citrus pectin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) as hunger suppressants and gut buddy stimulators. You can get the benefits without using this particu lar product. Spinach extract is available in 500 mg capsules, and I recommend you take two per day. DIM is available in capsule form, and the usual dose is 100 mg a day. Modified citrus pectin comes as a powder or in 500 mg capsul es. Take two capsules or one scoop per day. My stud ies show that modified citrus pectin reduces elevated galect in 3 levels, a key marker of myocardial and kidney stress, by decreasing the types of bad bugs in your gut and im proving the ratio of good guys. Prebiotics The nomenclature of what goes on in your intestinal tract is confusing at best. Pro biotics, which you now know, refer to the bugs that live in and on you. But pre biotics are the compounds that the probiotics need to eat in order to survive and grow. I like to think of these compound s as the fertilizer for the grass seed (the probiot ics). It turns out that many of the compounds that are used for the tr eatment of constipation, such as psyllium powder or husks, work not as a bowel stimulator laxative, but as a food f or your gut buddies; this makes them grow and multi ply, accounting for that bigger bowel movement. Even mor e interesting is the fact that the gang members in your gut can’t eat psyllium husks and other fibers, so prebi otics feed the good guys and starve the bad guys. One of the best prebiotics is inulin, an FOS that I have mentioned before. I like to call these fibrou s sugars “friends of Steve”! And a mother’s milk contains other impor tant prebiotics known as galactooligosaccharides (G OS), which are designed to feed the gut bugs of a newborn. Yup , breast milk feeds the entire baby—not just the hu man part! My good friend Dr. Terry Wahls believes that prebio tics primarily found in plants are so important tha t everyone should be eating nine cups of vegetables a day and, as a reminder, producing poops the size of coiled snakes twice a day. Now I applaud her efforts, but realistically, you are not going to eat that many vegetables every day, are you? However, because I completely agree with her, I des igned a practical way around the need to get this s tuff into you: GundryMD PrebioThrive. It combines five prebiotics including FOS and GOS in a powder that you simply m ix with water and drink daily. And believe me, you’ll start seeing large “snakes” in the toilet bowl soon enough! If you want to duplicate my recommendation yourself , try psyllium husks. Start with a teaspoon a day i n water and work up to a tablespoon a day. Also consider orderi ng GOS, which is available online. Good brands incl ude BiMuno and Probiota Immune. Take a packet or scoop each day. Then add a teaspoon of inulin powder a da y. Also the sweetener Just Like Sugar is primarily inulin. Lectin Blockers Remember my saying, “Do what you can do, with what you’ve got, wherever you are”? Well, despite our be st efforts, we all sometimes find ourselves in situati ons in which we must—or in which we accidentally—ea t some foods that contain lectins. You saw such incidents in many of my patients’ success stories. The good n ews is that there are a number of helpful lectin-absorbing comp ounds on the market. I designed a formula early in my career to help myself in such situations, and after many requ ests from my patients, I’ve recently released it as GundryMD"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"help myself in such situations, and after many requ ests from my patients, I’ve recently released it as GundryMD Lectin Shield. It combines nine proven ingredients to absorb or block lectins from reaching your gut w all. Simply take two capsules before a suspect meal. Alternatively, you could take glucosamine and MSM i n tablet form, but they are not the same ingredient s as those in my blend. That may explain why only 50 percent of p eople taking these supplements report lessening of arthritis pain. Products such as Osteo Bi-Flex or Move Free a re available at Costco or other larger retailers. A lso consider D- mannose, which is also in my Lectin Shield, in a do se of 500 mg twice a day, particularly if you are p rone to urinary tract infections. D-mannose is the active ingredien t in cranberries, although the juice provides ridic ulously small amounts. And ignore no-sugar-added cranberry juice— that claim means there is so much sugar in there al ready that we didn’t have to add any more! Sugar Defense Speaking of sugar, as you well know, we are awash i n it—not only in its most familiar form, but also i n high- fructose corn syrup and any simple carbohydrate tha t rapidly breaks down into sugar, including your fa vorite fruit. (That’s why I want you to think of fruit as candy.) I have been impressed through the years that the a ddition of a few simple supplements has made a major difference in my compliant patients’ glucose and HbA1C levels. Now in the past, this has meant acquiring and swallowing s ix different supplements, but after listening to th e complaints of my patients, I finally formulated my own product, c alled GundryMD Glucose Defense. It combines chromiu m, zinc, selenium, cinnamon bark extract, berberine, turmeri c extract, and black pepper extract. (The latter en hances absorbability. In fact, if you pick up a turmeric p roduct without black pepper extract as an ingredien t, return it.) You can take just two capsules, twice a day, to receive the whole spectrum of benefits. All these compound s change how your body and insulin handle the sugars you eat. If you prefer, Costco sells a wonderful product cal led CinSulin, which combines chromium and cinnamon. Take two capsules a day. Combine this with 30 mg of zinc once a day, 150 mcg of selenium a day, 250 mg of b erberine twice a day, and 200 mg of turmeric extract twice a day. Costco and online sources also offer Youtheor y’s Turmeric, which is an excellent product. Take three of those a day. Because turmeric is so poorly abso rbed, even when it includes a component of black pepper known as BioPerine, very little reaches your bloodstream. This is a shame because curcumin, the active ingredient in tu rmeric, is one of the few antioxidants to cross the blood-brain barrier into your brain. Because of this, I have de veloped BioMax Curcumin, my own formula of lipophil ic curcumin, which is absorbed via a different mechani sm, and thus reaches much higher blood levels, and which I currently take daily. Long-Chain Omega-3s I have been measuring RBC (red-blood-cell-bound) om ega-3 levels in my patients for ten years, and what I see scares me. Most people are profoundly deficient in the omega-3 fatty acids EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and, more important, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). In fact, the only people in my practice who have sufficient lev els of these brain-boosting fats without taking supplements eat sardines or herring on a daily basis. Even my patie nts from Seattle and Vancouver who eat salmon daily do not a chieve these results. Why should you worry? Well, y our brain is approximately 60 percent fat. In other words, la dies, when you want to call your husband or boyfrie nd a “fathead,” you unknowingly speak the truth! Half of the fat in your brain is DHA, and the other half a rachidonic acid (AA)—a great source of which is egg yolks. Stu dies show that people with the highest levels of om ega-3 fats in their blood have a better memory and a bigger brain than people with the lowest levels. 6 If that isn’t persuasive enough, remember that fish oil helps repair your gu t wall and keeps those nasty LPSs from getting acro ss your gut border. I recommend choosing a fish oil that is molecularly distilled and comes from small fish such as sardin es and anchovies. I’ve been so impressed with the longevit y data coming from the tiny fishing village of Acci aroli, in southern Italy, where the diet is heavily based on anchovies and rosemary, that I’ve formulated my own omega-3"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"southern Italy, where the diet is heavily based on anchovies and rosemary, that I’ve formulated my own omega-3 supplement with DHA, EPA, and rosemary extract. When taking fish oil, try to achieve 1000 mg of DHA per day. On the back of the bottle, you will find the serving size—either per capsule or per teaspoon if it is a liquid; then look under “ingredients” to find the D HA content per capsule or teaspoon. Calculate how many capsules or teaspoons will get you at or above 1000 mg of DHA per day. There are several good national brands. Kirkland Si gnature Fish Oil, 1200 mg Enteric Coated, available at Costco and online, means no fishy burps. It has a blue (no t yellow) label, and is the supplement I took for y ears before developing my own formula. OmegaVia DHA 600 is a ni ce small capsule that my female patients love. Carl son’s Elite Gems can be swallowed or chewed. Carlson also makes an excellent lemon-flavored fish oil.

Additional Supplements for the Keto Plant Paradox I ntensive Care Program IF YOU ARE adhering to the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program recommendations, you will rapidly, often within days, use up glycogen, the sugar store d in your liver and muscles. This form of sugar is stored with a water molecule attached, which accounts for the rap id weight loss in this program. But along with the water, two important minerals, potassium and magnesium, are wa shed out. Both of these elements are responsible fo r keeping muscle cells from cramping, so many people complain about leg cramps early in the program. While distu rbing, I view them as a sign that you are being compliant an d following the program. But the supplement potassi um magnesium aspartate can stop the cramps. Several co mpanies make this in a standard form, usually 99 mg of potassium and 299 or 300 mg of magnesium. I suggest taking one twice a day. Occasionally, the magnesiu m will cause loose stools, so back down to one in that eve nt. The Meaning of a Supplement ONE FINAL THOUGHT on supplements: Many people still believe that the re is a supplement magic bullet—in other words, that one or more supplements will some how correct an ongoing reliance on the typical West ern diet, as well as cause everything to magically reverse cours e and heal the body. I can assure you that this is nonsense, and I say that because I have witnessed this misconceptio n in my patients’ blood work far too many times ove r the last seventeen years. However, if you embark on the Plan t Paradox Program, many of these supplements will a nd do provide measurable benefits. I have presented studi es on such benefits at prestigious national and int ernational meetings. Remember, true to their name, supplements enhance the results of the Plant Paradox Program—b ut they are not substitutes for the program."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"————— PART III ————— Meal Plans and Recipes —————————————"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Sample Meal Plans Sample Meal Plans for Phase 1: The Three-Day Kick-S tart Cleanse RECIPES FOR ALL these meals appear in the recipe section .

Irina Skoeries of Catalyst Cu isine developed the recipes for the Three-Day Kick-Start Cleanse, a long with the meal plans for this initial phase, fo r which I owe her a debt of gratitude. The recipes for all three phases will guide you in selecting the kinds of foo ds that will help you achieve your goals, whether you want to lose or regain weight, or eliminate or alleviate one or mo re of a long list of health problems. All the recipes are also s uitable for the Plant Paradox Intensive Care progra m, sometimes with small modifications. Please also regard the re cipes as inspiration to devise your own meals suita ble for the Plant Paradox Program. You can continue to use the Phase 1 recipes as you move through the program. Th e same applies to the Phase 2 recipes, which are also suit able for Phase 3 although you will want to reduce t he amount of fish or other animal protein to 2 ounces per servin g. Many of the recipes contain no animal protein. F or those that do, I have provided vegetarian and vegan versions. One recipe contains pressure-cooked beans, making i t suitable only for Phase 3. However, if you are a vegetarian or vegan, you can eat beans, as long as they are pr essure cooked, in Phase 2, and I have provided suitable variations of this recipe for you. I cannot stress enough the importance of eating a w ide variety of vegetables, as well as those raised organically. Eat the vegetables and the few fruits on the Say “Yes P lease” list in season. Feel free to substitute acce ptable fresh ingredients depending upon what’s available at your store or farmers’ market, and don’t hesitate to us e organic frozen in place of fresh nonorganic ingredients. How to Evolve Your Shopping Style MOST OF THE ingredients in these recipes can be found in a wel l-stocked supermarket. However, some recipes may call for ingredients that may be new to you, su ch as cassava flour and millet—or you may not know where to find them. These products are usually found in a na tural foods store. When such foods are not availabl e locally, you can order them from Amazon, Vitacost, Thrive Market , and other online retailers. Some ingredients, suc h as natural (nonalkalized) cocoa powder or baking powder that d oes not contain aluminum, differ in important ways from those you may be currently using. Once you try some of th ese ingredients and realize how they increase your options and ability to follow the Plant Paradox Program, I thin k you will find them as essential as I do. Valuable information on some of my favorites follow s. ALMOND BUTTER : Look for organic, unsweetened products made from raw and preferably non-GMO almonds. Avoid any products that contain partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats). ALMOND FLOUR: Made of finely ground almonds, it is available in natural foods stores and online. Almond meal is less finely ground. Ideally, you want a pro duct that uses non-GMO almonds. ALMOND MILK: Use only unsweetened, organic unflavored products. Don’t be fooled by terms like “lite” and “low-fat.” Again, opt for a product that uses n on-GMO almonds. ARROWROOT FLOUR: Also called arrowroot starch, this flour made from the root of the arrowroot herb is free of gluten and other lectins and can be mixed w ith other “flours” in baked goods, waffles, and pan cakes, as well as used for thickening sauces in lieu of corns tarch. AVOCADO: My preference is for Hass avocados, which are dark green or black and have a pebbly skin. Several other acceptable varieties include the larg e, bright green Florida avocados with a smooth skin . AVOCADO MAYONNAISE: Instead of traditional olive oil (or the various u nacceptable oils usually used in prepared mayo), the basis of this condiment is avoc ado oil. Primal Kitchen makes a great avocado mayon naise. AVOCADO OIL: Full of monounsaturated fats, tasteless, and with one of the highest smoke points, avocado oil is an excellent all-purpose oil. Look for oil m ade from Hass avocados (see above). Costco and most supermarkets offer it. BAKING POWDER, ALUMINUM-FREE: Conventional baking powder is basically a combinat ion of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"BAKING POWDER, ALUMINUM-FREE: Conventional baking powder is basically a combinat ion of sodium aluminum phosphate or sodium aluminum sulfat e and baking soda. The acid and soda combine to cre ate carbon dioxide gas, which makes baked goods rise. Y ou do not want aluminum in your body! Bob’s Red Mil l and Rumford are two widely available aluminum-free brands. BASMATI RICE: Acceptable in small amounts in Phase 3, white basm ati rice from India (not Texas) has the lowest lectin content and most resistant starch of any rice. BLACK PEPPER: Cracked black pepper has a more robust flavor than the more finely ground black pepper. You’ll find it already cracked in the spice section of your supermarket; or you can simply crack whole peppercorns by mashing them with the side of a chef ’s knife. Jimmy Schmidt, a James Beard Award–winnin g chef, prefers Tellicherry peppercorns, which can be found at Costco, as well as many other stores. CASSAVA FLOUR: Although they come from the same root (manioc or y uca), cassava flour is not the same thing as tapioca flour. Cassava flour is the key to fluffy nongluten baking, and I have tried all the brands of it out there. Amazon sells Moon Rabbit, Otto’s Naturals, a nd others if you cannot find it in your supermarket . CAYENNE PEPPER: Like all bell and chili peppers, the peel and seed s of cayenne peppers contain lectins. However, the spice is ground only after both are re moved, so its lectin content is limited. The same g oes for Capsicum annuum, used to make paprika. CHOCOLATE: You want to use an unsweetened product that is at least 72% cacao for making the occasional dessert. Trader Joe’s, Lindt, Valrona, and many oth ers make dark chocolate that is 85–90% cacao. Dagob a and Lily’s make excellent chocolate chips and World Mar ket offers a great 99% cacao baking chocolate that actually has a bit of sweet taste. COCOA POWDER: Not to be confused with cocoa powder mix, which is sweetened. Use only natural (aka nonalkalized) products, which contain none of the p otassium bromate or potassium carbonate used to neu tralize the bitter polyphenols in the beans. Do not use Dut ch process (alkalized) cocoa powder. Without the polyphenols, cocoa has little health benefit. My fa vorite brands are Dagoba and Scharffen Berger. COCONUT CREAM: Don’t confuse this with the beverage that comes in a cardboard package. Coconut cream is sometimes called coconut milk, but it is thicker than the beverage and comes in a can. Avoid any pr oducts with added sugar, such as Cocoloco, or that are lab eled low fat, and ensure that the can is not lined with the deadly disruptor BPA. Trader Joe’s makes a great th ick coconut cream. COCONUT FLOUR: You’ll find this baking ingredient at most well-st ocked supermarkets, natural foods stores, and online. It is much denser than grain fl ours, meaning it absorbs more liquid; therefore, it ’s best to follow a recipe closely until you become familiar w ith this flour’s properties. Bob’s Red Mill, Nutiva , and Let’s Do all offer organic coconut flour. COCONUT MILK: This nondairy beverage is increasingly available i n both the refrigerated section of the supermarket and in a Tetra Pak that can be stored a t room temperature until it is opened. It has the c onsistency more of whole milk than almond or hemp milk. Avoid any products with added sugar or flavors. COCONUT OIL : Excellent for sautéing, coconut oil will be liqui d in warm weather, and solid below about 70ºF. To liquefy, place the jar in hot water for a few minutes or in a microwave oven for a few second s. This oil is increasingly available in supermarkets, specialt y markets, and of course online. Look for extra-vir gin organic coconut oil from manufacturers such as Kirkland Viv a Labs, Carrington Farms, and Nature’s Way, among m any others. ERYTHRITOL: See Swerve. FLAXSEED MEAL: Like flaxseed oil, this is a good source of omega- 3 fats. But if you buy ground flaxseed, it should be cold-milled, meaning no heat was involved in the processing. (The reason is that heat can ma ke the oils go rancid.) You can grind whole flaxseed yours elf in a coffee mill or spice mill. In either case, once ground, keep it in the freezer or refrigerator to avoid ran cidity. GHEE: Clarified butter, or ghee, has been essential to I ndian cuisine for centuries. Long before refrigerat ion"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"GHEE: Clarified butter, or ghee, has been essential to I ndian cuisine for centuries. Long before refrigerat ion became the norm, clarifying butter removed the milk solids (protein), making it shelf stable. This als o means ghee contains no casein A-1, because it is 100 perc ent fat with no protein content. Nonetheless, do lo ok for brands such as Pure or Pure Indian Foods, both from grass-fed cows, which have a better omega-3 profil e than conventionally raised animals. GOAT DAIRY PRODUCTS: Goat milk in liquid and powdered form (Meyenberg i s one brand) is readily available at most supermarkets, as is soft goat che ese (also known as chèvre). Trader Joe’s and natura l food markets offer goat yogurt, while goat butter is ava ilable at stores that carry more specialty products , such as Whole Foods. HEMP MILK: Like coconut milk, hemp milk is an alternative to cow’s milk and can be used in smoothies and baked goods. Pacific Natural and Living Harvest bra nds are both widely available. Hemp is a cousin of marijuana, but no, you will not get high from drink ing it. Be sure to purchase the kind without sweete ners or added flavors. HEMP PROTEIN POWDER: Great for smoothies, this powder contains all the essential amino acids, is high in heart-healthy omega-3s, and has all the benefits of whey protein powder without the downsides (many whey powders contain sugar or artificial sweeteners). Ve gans who wish to avoid whey products can use hemp p rotein. HEMP TOFU: Sometimes called hefu, this fermented product is m ade the same way that tofu is but with hemp seeds rather than soybeans. The result is somewhat denser and more textured than soy tofu. Living Harv est Tempt hemp tofu, which is non-GMO, is available at Whole Foods. HONEY: In Phase 3 only, you can have a maximum of a teasp oon a day of local raw honey, or Manuka honey (from bees that feed on the nectar from the flowers of the manuka tree native to New Zealand and Austr alia). But remember, honey is not “natural sugar”—it is su gar. Period. Likewise, using ½ cup of honey or mapl e syrup in a dessert doesn’t make it Paleo. It simply makes it full of sugar! INULIN: See Just Like Sugar. JUST LIKE SUGAR: This natural sweetener is made from chicory root o r agave (not to be confused with agave, the sweetener), which contains the polysacch aride inulin that your gut bugs love but you cannot metabolize. It can be found in natural foods stores and online; it’s also sold as Viv Agave Organic Bl ue Agave Inulin at Whole Foods. MARINE COLLAGEN: Although made from fish, this collagen has no fish y taste or, in fact, any taste at all— repeat, it has no taste. Amazon sells the Vital Pro teins version of this product. MILLET: Millet has no hull, meaning—paradoxically—that it is a lectin-free grain. You can find it in most well-stocked supermarkets, from Bob’s Red Mill and other manufacturers. MIRACLE RICE: Made from the konjac root—the main ingredient is g lucomannan—Miracle Rice is a good stand-in for rice. (The same manufacturer devised M iracle Noodles about a decade earlier.) You will fi nd Miracle Rice in the refrigerated section near the t ofu, but this product doesn’t require refrigeration , unlike other konjac root products. MOZZARELLA: Use only those products made from goat or water bu ffalo milk. It comes in baseball-sized balls packed in water. Buffalo mozzarella is easily found in most supermarkets or Italian grocery stor es. You may have to order goat cheese mozzarella from Amazo n or another online source. NORI: The fish and rice in sushi are often wrapped in no ri, seaweed that has been roasted, rolled, and flat tened to the thickness of a piece of paper. Although it i s a staple of Japanese cuisine, nori makes a great wrap (or cone) for my recipes, as well as for scrambled eggs or tu na salad and other sandwich fillings. You will find it in any supermarket, but to get an organic product, you may need to go to Whole Foods or shop online. NUTRITIONAL YEAST: Not to be confused with the yeast that allows brea d to rise, nutritional yeast is a great source of B vitamins and can lend a meat, egg , or cheese taste to vegan or vegetarian recipes. Y ou’ll find it in flake or powder form in natural foods stores and online."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"OLIVE OIL: Use only extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), preferably cold pressed (the same as first pressed) for cooking and dressing salads and other vegetables. PAPRIKA : See cayenne pepper. PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO: This aged, hard grating cheese is made from cow’s milk collected only during the spring and fall grass-growing season. Use only a product imported from Italy, where the cows also do not have the casein A-1 mutation. Parmigiano-Reggiano i s sometimes called the king of cheeses. Do not mist ake generic Parmesan cheese for the real McCoy. PECORINO-ROMANO: This readily available grating cheese from Tuscany is made from sheep’s milk, making it acceptable on the Plant Paradox Program. PERILLA OIL: Made from the seeds of the perilla plant, this is the most common oil used in most Asian countries, and it has the highest content of alpha linolenic acid, a form of omega-3 fat associated wi th protecting heart health, of any oil. Look for it in Asian mark ets, natural foods stores, and Whole Foods, as well as online. QUORN PRODUCTS: These foods are made from a mushroom “root,” which Quorn calls mycoprotein, and which has the texture and mild flavor of chicken or turkey. Use only approved versions on the Say “Yes Please” list. Offerings include patties, cutlets, and groun ds. Certain products contain a small amount of egg white, making them unsuitable for vegans. Products in the vegan line contain a little potato and gluten, so t hey are unacceptable. Also avoid any breaded items. You’ll find Quorn products in the vegetarian frozen foods section of any supermarket. SEA SALT: Unlike standard table salt, which is mined and pro cessed, sea salt is simply harvested from evaporated seawater. However, most table salt has a dded iodine, a nutrient essential for proper thyroi d function. To get the best of both worlds, opt for iodized sea salt. Hain and Morton products are available in su permarkets, and you can find numerous offerings from different parts of the world in natural foods stores and onli ne. SORGHUM: One of only two grains without a hull, sorghum con tains no lectins. It was the original staple grain in India until rice supplanted it. Bob’s Red Mill s orghum can be found in any well-stocked supermarket . Sorghum can be used as a breakfast cereal, side dis h, or salad, or it can be popped exactly like popco rn. You can find it online prepopped as Mini Pops. STEVIA: Unlike artificial no-calorie sweeteners, stevia is a natural product. This herb, which is about three hundred times sweeter than sugar, comes in powdered form or as drops. Unlike other powdered brands, SweetLeaf contains no maltodextrin or other fillers , and the first ingredient in the powdered form is actually your gut buddies’ friend inulin. SWERVE: This natural sweetener is made from erythritol (wh ich is also found in asparagus and certain other plant foods, as well as in fermented foods) and oli gosaccharides (see inulin, above), which your gut b uddies love. Erythritol is also less likely than other sug ar alcohols to cause gastric upset. Unlike some sug ar substitutes, Swerve is ideal for baking. Find it in bags and pac kets at Stop & Shop, Giant, Whole Foods, and natura l foods stores. TEMPEH: Tempeh is fermented soybeans formed into high-prot ein blocks. It’s available refrigerated or frozen in natural foods stores and most supermarkets. Buy only tempeh made without grains. VANILLA EXTRACT: Don’t be fooled by little brown bottles filled wit h imitation vanilla extract, which are flavored with a concoction from a chemistry lab ins tead of vanilla beans. Look carefully at the label for the word “pure,” because brands such as McCormick sell both the real deal and the imitation kind. Preferably yo u want the organic version. VEGANEGG: Although this product mimics the taste and binding power of eggs for recipes, it’s made from algal flour and algal protein, nutritional yeast, a nd other plant sources. It is lectin-free, dairy-fr ee, non-GMO, and suitable for vegans. Still in limited distribution, it is available from Thrive Market, Amazon, and ot her online sources. For more information, visit www.followyour heart.com."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"WHEY PROTEIN POWDER: A by-product of cheese making, whey protein powder comes in plain or flavored versions. Read the labels carefully. Many whey powders are loaded with sugars or artificial s weeteners. Whey protein also elevates insulinlike growth facto r (IGF), which explains why bodybuilders use it to build muscle. However, IGF stimulates cancer and ages you , so please be careful with your consumption. YOGURT: Use only unsweetened, unflavored, organic yogurt m ade from goat or sheep milk. My preference, however, is “yogurt” made from fermented coconut mi lk or hemp milk. Tools for Success IF YOU HAVE some good pots and frying pans, sharp knives, and a vegetable peeler, you already have most of what you need in your kitchen to get cooking the he althy Plant Paradox way. A grill pan or grill, or a George Foreman–type indoor griller, is also invaluable. Ot her appliances, such as a blender, are essential, a nd there are other tools that can save you time and effort. Here is the checklist of the tools you’ll need. BLENDER : A high-speed blender such as a Vitamix, Blendtec, or Ninja liquefies smoothie ingredients in seconds, enables you to make soups without needing to use the stove top, and simply speeds laborious t asks such as chopping and combining ingredients. A high-power ed mini-blender such as a Magic Bullet or a Nutribu llet can handle many of my recipes as well (see below). A standard blender will handle most jobs, but may t ake longer or require you to do the job in several step s (and it can’t deliver warm soup). FOOD PROCESSOR : Nothing beats a good food processor for chopping, slicing, combining ingredients for baked goods, making pesto, and dozens of other culi nary tasks. MAGIC BULLET : Inexpensive and easier to clean than a blender or a food processor, this powerful mini- blender can also handle most of the chopping chores a food processor does. If you use it mostly for si ngle servings of smoothies, and don’t do much cooking or cook for groups, this appliance may be the only bl ender or food processor you need. MICROWAVE OVEN : Even a tiny countertop model will help you get Pl ant Paradox friendly breakfasts on the table in minutes. MINI FOOD PROCESSOR : For a small investment, this small processor is i deal for chopping garlic, herbs, small portions of nuts, and the like. PRESSURE COOKER : If you are able to reintroduce legumes, rice, and certain other grains in Phase 3, you should definitely consider purchasing a pressure co oker, which destroys their lectins. (See “ Not Grandma’s Pressure Cooker .”) SALAD SPINNER : This is an indispensable tool for encouraging you to eat and enjoy more salad greens. Spinning removes as much residual moisture as possi ble from lettuce and other greens and allows the sa lad dressing to cling to the greens. SPIRALIZER : When you say good-bye to pasta, this handy device turns carrots, daikon radishes, jicama, and root vegetables into “noodles.” Don’t bother buying a fancy and expensive electric spiralizer. Instead , a hand- operated spiralizer that costs about $15 will do th e job.

Dr. G.’s New and Improved World-Famous Nut Mix Every patient who visits our office to give blood o r see me is rewarded with ¼ cup of my nut mix to mu nch on. Based on copious data that nuts protect your heart, brain, and overall health, this mix has been a par t of my program since its inception. We now know that the r esistant starches in nuts are just what your gut bu ddies have been asking for! This is why they have the remarkab le ability to make you feel full and satisfied for hours. My recipe originally contained peanuts and pumpkin seeds, but after seeing the effects of their lectin s in a number of my patients, we modified the original mix about ten years ago to make it Plant Paradox friendly. Nuts are good for you, but only in moderation. Put them in snack bags in ¼ cup servings, or ladle them out with a ¼ cup measure. Phases 2–3 Makes 10 cups (40 servings) Prep time: 5 minutes 1 pound raw shelled walnuts in halves and pieces 1 pound raw shelled pistachios or salted and dry-ro asted pistachios 1 pound raw shelled macadamia nuts* or salted and d ry-roasted macadamias Put the nuts in a large bowl and stir with your han ds or a spoon to mix well. Bag in individual servin gs and store in the refrigerator. * If raw macadamia nuts are in halves, they are most likely rancid. Use roasted ones instead.

Main and Side Dishes Tops and Bottoms Celery Soup Celery root, aka celeriac, is a strong contender fo r the world’s ugliest vegetable, but it makes up fo r its looks in taste. Plus tubers and roots of any kind make your gut buddies jump for joy. My challenge is to get yo u to eat these foods. Everyone enjoys a hearty soup, but unfortunately, m ost creamy soups rely on cream, flour, and potatoes as thickening agents.

Unlike all other grains except millet, sorghum has no hull, meaning no lect ins. What it does have is a cornucopia of polypheno ls and anticancer properties. And it tastes great to boot! Cook sorghum when you have an hour or so to spare, and freeze or refrigerate portions for later use. I t never, ever goes mushy. Combine it with one of the greatest sou rces of inulin, radicchio (it is sometimes called I talian red lettuce, but it is really part of the chicory famil y), and some nuts, and you and your bugs will be re ady for anything! Perilla, macadamia, or avocado oil can be substitut ed for the olive oil.

We love raw f ood, but sometimes it just needs to be warmed up. A fter years of raw eating, we have come up with a medley of mushro om soups—this one is the easiest and our best yet. All you need is a food processor or a high-powered blender, and you’ll have a warm or hot soup in minutes. Plu s, it’s vegan-friendly. With a side salad, this soup makes a full meal. Cho ose your favorite mushroom—button, cremini, morels, chanterelles, shiitake, or portabella—or mix them u p. Your gut buddies adore all mushrooms! Truffle oil is optional, but I highly recommend it.

Pour or spoon the soup into two bowls. It should be thick and gravylike. Top with the chopped mushroom s, drizzle with the truffle oil, if desired, and serve. Spinach Pizza with a Cauliflower Crust Riced cauliflower makes up the crust in this delici ous pizza. To rice cauliflower, chop it evenly but do not completely pulverize it. You can grate the cauliflo wer with a cheese grater, using the largest holes, into rice-shaped pieces. Or pulse it in a food processor, using the S-blade and being careful not to overprocess it. If you use a food processor, cut the cauliflower into chunks first. Y ou’ll need to extract as much water from the cooked riced cauliflower as possible. (It may yield as much as 1 cup liquid.) Unless the cauliflower is completely dry, the pizza “dough” will be mushy. Goat milk mozzarella is available from Amazon and o ther online sources. Feel free to add some other lectin-free vegetables but don’t overload the pizza crust with more veggie s than it can support.

Grilled Portabella-Pesto Mini “Pizzas” Probably the first thought that went through your h ead when you realized you were omitting wheat flour , tomatoes, and cow milk cheese was “I can’t live without pizza !” In fact, you can live better without it, but I f eel your pain. Here is a replacement that I cooked up over my wife Penny’s initial objections, but it is now her favo rite way to have pizza. While you make your own pesto here, honestly, the o ne that comes closest to the true pesto of Liguria (a section of Italy where Penny and I have hiked extensively) is Kirkland’s refrigerated pesto, sold at Costco, whic h uses only Ligurian basil. So feel free to substitute that. Save or freeze the portabella mushroom stems for “Raw” Mushroom Soup .

Nutty, Juicy Shroom Burgers, Protein Style You have probably heard about the new veggie burger that bleeds “blood.” Sounds good until you read th e list of ingredients, which read like a who’s who of lectins . My wife and I make raw taco “meat” with walnuts and mushrooms, so I decided to do a “bloody burger” us ing my taco recipe and adding red beets for the crimson hu e. Pick a beet about the size of a baseball. Use an y kind of mushroom, but portabella or cremini have a meatier texture. Lettuce leaves stand in for “buns” (here i n California, we call a burger served this way “protein style”). Then enjoy your meaty, red-tinged burger minus the meat. For you die-hard carnivores, I’ve added a real meat version.

Roast Parmesan-Scented Cauliflower Mash My best friend Jimmy Schmidt, the James Beard Award –winning chef at Morgan’s in the Desert at the La Q uinta Resort and Club, invented this recipe, which I have modified ever so slightly for the Plant Paradox Pr ogram.

Pressure-Cooked Lima Beans, Kale, and Turkey I am a frequent visitor to the tiny villages of Tus cany. In every town, beans cooked in deep glass fla sks are a popular side dish, and one I cannot resist. I usual ly paid dearly later in the day when the “attack of the lectins” began, as did my wife, trapped in the car with me m oaning. However, with the arrival of my pressure co oker, I can now have my beans and eat them, too—plus my gut bud dies get the benefits of beans.

Thoroughly Modern Millet Cakes I am one of the world’s experts on the dietary trea tment of the ApoE4 gene, which 30 percent of all pe ople carry. It is unfortunately named the Alzheimer’s gene, becaus e of its strong association with that disease. Nige rians have the highest proportion of this gene in their population , but they have a very low incidence of dementia, a fact often attributed to their mostly plant-based diet. Their grain of choice is millet, sometimes called birdsee d, which is free of lectins. I have spent the last fifteen years formulating use r-friendly vegaquarian recipes for the large popula tion with the ApoE4 gene, and I wanted to share some of that with you—so here is a great way to consume millet witho ut having to raid your bird feeder!

Veggie Curry with Sweet Potato “Noodles” I’m a huge fan of curry as a way to consume turmeri c, but since most curries are served over rice, tha t’s a nonstarter—at least until you are in Phase 3.

You may equate it with ta pioca flour, because they come from the same root, but cassava f lour is the key to fluffy, nongluten baking. (Trust me, I’ve tried them all.) I’ve modified this great recipe by blogger Heather Resler, after meeting with my good friends at Vital Proteins to get some help for vegaquarians like me (and hopeful ly you). Have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The folks at Vital Proteins have come up with marin e collagen from wild salmon that just blows me away ! It has no fishy taste or any taste—repeat, none. Have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The marine collagen ad ds fish protein. If necessary, melt the coconut oil in the microwave on high for 30 seconds or set into a bowl of hot w ater until melted.

Marinated Grilled Cauliflower “Steaks” A few years ago, my wife and I sat down for lunch a t Da Silvano’s in Manhattan, one of our favorite It alian restaurants. My friend Silvano Marchetto is the own er, and that afternoon he walked over to our table with a glint in his eye, placing a plate, two forks, and a bottl e of his own Tuscan olive oil in front of us. “Try this,” he said. The rest is history. Cauliflower “steak” is now a perma nent fixture on the Da Silvano’s menu—and in our ho use. I’ve adapted his brilliant idea for you here. Substitute avocado, perilla oil, or macadamia nut o il for the olive oil, if you wish. Phases 2–3 Serves 4 Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 10–15 minutes ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for s erving 2 teaspoons minced onion ½ teaspoon garlic powder 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper Sea salt, preferably iodized Cracked black pepper Juice of 1 lemon 2 heads cauliflower Place the ½ cup olive oil, the onion, garlic powder , Italian seasoning, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Add salt and black pepper to taste and the lemon juice. Whisk to combine. Transfer to a shallow pan. Using a large chef’s knife, cut off the cauliflower stems flush with the head. Place the stem ends dow n on a cutting board. Slice each cauliflower in half. Then cut int o slices ½ to 1 inch thick (steaks). Turn on the exhaust fan if cooking indoors. Heat th e grill to medium, or place a grill pan over medium -high heat on the stove top. Using tongs, dip the cauliflower steaks in the mari nade. Place on the grill or grill pan and cook 5 to 8 minutes per side, until browned on the outside and tender insid e. Transfer to a serving platter. Adjust the season ings and serve with more olive oil.

But your gut and the res t of your body will thank you for changing. The fol ks at Miracle Noodles, whose products I featured in my first book as “foodles,” have developed Miracle Rice, which m akes a good stand-in for rice and is widely available. Mir acle Rice is made from the konjac root, whose main ingredient is glucomannan, an amazing resistant starch that your gut buddies adore. On the few occasions when you de cide to have dessert, how about having something that feeds the good guys, and not the gang members? You even get to pick between the chocolate and vanilla versions. Phases 2–3 Serves 4 Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes 2 bags of Miracle Rice 4 to 5 tablespoons arrowroot powder 3½ cups canned unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk o r coconut cream 1 teaspoon ghee or French or Italian butter, plus a dditional for oiling the pan 1 cup Just Like Sugar, or ½ cup Swerve 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract ¼ cup (nonalkalized) cocoa powder 1 pastured or omega-3 egg, whisked Heat the oven to 350°F. Drain the Miracle Rice in a colander and rinse unde r running water for about a minute. Set aside to dr ain further. Put 4 tablespoons of the arrowroot powder and ½ cup of the coconut milk or cream in a small bowl, and stir to dissolve. Add more arrowroot if necessary.

Add about 1 tablespoon of the dissolved arrowroot m ixture to the “rice,” stirring to incorporate. Repe at 1 tablespoon at a time until you achieve the desired thickness. Add a bit more coconut milk if it seems too thick. Lightly grease an 8-by-8-inch Pyrex baking dish or 8-inch bowl with butter or ghee. Pour the pudding i nto the dish and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top is gol den brown. Remove from the oven and cool a bit befo re serving, or refrigerate and serve cold.

Thank you a gain, Ed. Since the publication of my earlier book, tens of t housands of patients have come to Palm Springs or S anta Barbara to see me at the International Heart and Lung Insti tute, and within it, the Center for Restorative Med icine. Hundreds of thousands of other people have written to tell m e about the success they have experienced by follow ing Diet Evolution and the subsequent program, “Matrix,” on which thi s book is based. Without my patients’ tireless sear ch for health and their willingness to let me examine their blood test results every three months for yea rs on end, The Plant Paradox would never have come to fruition. As my dedicatio n says, everything I know, or learned, is because of you. Once again, my wonderful wife and soul mate, Penny, has not only endured many days and nights without the presence of my brain and attention while I was writ ing this book, but also the many days and nights wi thout my physical presence while I traveled to present the r esults of my research to a worldwide audience. She has also been my best critic of my early versions of the manuscri pt and “crazy” ideas for supplements. Thank you aga in for your patience and love. I have banked that love and prom ise to repay it with interest! As with my first book, this one would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of my collab orator, Olivia Bell Buehl, who takes my wordy manuscripts and empl oys her word-smithing magic to transform them into readable and usable books. This one has been more o f a challenge on many levels than our first, but I’ m so glad we both persevered to deliver to you this wonderful gu ide for your health. My office is under the direction of Susan Lokken, m y right-hand woman aka administrative assistant and office manager, who somehow gets me where I need to be, ge ts patients what they need, and keeps order in an environment that is constantly besieged by requests from people worldwide to somehow get them past the seven- month waiting list and in to see me “tomorrow” to a ddress a life-threatening health issue. Without Sus an, nothing in this book would have happened. Another huge thank-you to Adda Harris, who reversed her own personal health issues by following the Pl ant Paradox, and now somehow juggles patient care and t raining while always showing a welcoming concern fo r any issue a patient might have. As we say, “You go, gir l!” I cannot say enough about my former nurse practitio ner, Jean Epstein, who collaborated on many of my r esearch papers, and brought joy and comfort to so many of o ur mutual patients. Not a day goes by that we don’t all miss you. I cannot resist mentioning my younger daughter, Mel issa Perko, who manages my wife’s store Zense on El Paseo Drive in Palm Desert, but who also dives into my of fice for four months every summer to bring order to chaos. I know how much it means to you to have a chance to b oss your father around! And how much it means to me to have you nearby! The kickoff for the Plant Paradox Program couldn’t have happened without my dear friend and supporter, the great chef Irina Skoeries—and I thank her for her enthusi asm and tireless commitment to making vibrant healt h a reality for everyone. Having witnessed her skill in salvagi ng several of my toughest patients with nourishing and delectable food, I knew she had to develop the Thre e-Day Kick-Start Cleanse for Phase 1! Thank you, Ir ina! Another heartfelt thanks to Celia Hamilton of Palm Springs, who has guided so many of my patients back from the brink of despair and toward thriving health with he r loving care in teaching and living my principles. Any of you who have visited my office have encounte red my fantastic team of “Blood Suckers,” who have convinced you to relinquish up to a dozen vials of blood every few months without pain! Believe me, no thing I have learned and written here would have been possi ble without Laurie Acuna and her team. Thank you al l. I owe a huge debt to my agent, Shannon Marven, pres ident of Dupree-Miller, and her great associate, Da bney Rice, who connected me with Harper Wave and who then cons istently and calmly kept everything on track.

Gundry, MD, is a cum laude graduate of Yale University, with s pecial honors in human biological and social evolution. After graduating Alpha Omega Alph a from the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. Gundry completed residencies in general surgery and cardio thoracic surgery at the University of Michigan and served as a clinical associate at the National Institutes of He alth. He invented devices that reverse the cell dea th seen in heart attacks; variations of these devices became the Med tronic Gundry Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannula, the most widely used device of its kind worldwide to protect the heart during open-heart surgery. After complet ing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at the Hospi tal for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, in Lond on, and two years as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Dr. Gundry was recruited as pro fessor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda Un iversity School of Medicine. During his tenure at Loma Linda, Dr. Gundry pioneer ed the field of xenotransplantation, the study of h ow the immune system and blood vessel proteins of one spec ies react to the transplanted heart of a foreign sp ecies. He was one of the original twenty investigators of the fir st FDA-approved implantable left ventricular assist device. Dr. Gundry is the inventor of the Gundry Ministernotomy , the most widely used minimally invasive surgical technique to operate on the aortic valve; the Gundry Lateral Tunnel, a living tissue that can rebuild parts of t he heart in children with severe congenital heart malformations ; and the Skoosh Venous Cannula, the most widely us ed cannula in minimally invasive heart operations. As a consultant to Computer Motion (now Intuitive S urgical), Dr. Gundry was one of the fathers of robo tic heart surgery. He received early FDA approval for robotic -assisted minimally invasive surgery for coronary a rtery bypass and mitral valve operations. He holds patents on co nnecting blood vessels and coronary artery bypasses without the need for sutures, as well as on repairing the mitra l valve without the need for sutures and the heart- lung machine. Dr. Gundry has served on the Board of Directors of the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs and was a founding board member and treasurer of the Internat ional Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery. He also served two successive terms as president of the Board of Directors of the American Heart Assoc iation, Desert Division. Dr. Gundry has been elected a Fell ow of the American College of Surgeons, the America n College of Cardiology, the American Surgical Association, t he American Academy of Pediatrics, and the College of Chest Physicians. He has served numerous times as an abst ract reviewer for the American Heart Association an nual meetings. The author of more than three hundred art icles, chapters, and abstracts in peer-reviewed jou rnals on surgical, immunologic, genetic, nutritional, and li pid investigations, he has also operated in more th an thirty countries, including on multiple charitable mission s. In 2000, inspired by the stunning reversal of coron ary artery disease in an “inoperable” patient by us ing a combination of dietary changes and nutriceutical su pplements, Dr. Gundry changed the arc of his career . An obese chronic diet failure himself, he adapted his Yale U niversity thesis to design a diet based on evolutio nary coding and the interaction of our ancestral microbiome, genes, and environment. Following this program enabled hi m to reverse his own numerous medical problems. In the p rocess, he effortlessly lost seventy pounds and has kept them off for seventeen years. These discoveries led him to establish the International Heart and Lung Insti tute—and, as part of it, the Center for Restorative Medicine—in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara, California. There h e has devoted his research and clinical practice to the d ietary and nutriceutical reversal of most diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, cancer, arth ritis, kidney failure, and neurological conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, using sophisticat ed blood tests and blood flow measurements to maxim ize his patients’ health span and longevity. This research resulted in the publication of his be stselling first book, Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and Your Waistline , in 2008. Following up on the success of that book , he has become one of the world’s authorities on the human microbi ome and the interaction between the gut, the foods we ingest, the products we use, and our physical and mental he alth and well-being. In recent years, more than 50 percent of his practice has been devoted to the reversal of challe nging autoimmune conditions in patients referred to him by health professionals around the world."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Dr. Gundry has been named one of America’s Top Doct ors for twenty-one years in a row by Castle Connoll y, the independent physician rating company; to Palm Springs Life Top Doctors for fifteen years in a row; and to Los Angeles Magazine’s Top Doctors for the last six years.
