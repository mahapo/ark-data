In thisvery short time, I’ve seen and heard the results of dramatic reversals ofdiseases I once thought impossible to achieve without medical intervention.These are changes that we can observe quantitatively in blood tests, andqualitatively in the reports of thousands of people whose quality of lifeimproves each day. Whether it’s reducing or throwing away medications for highblood pressure, diabetes, or cholesterol; resolving the painful symptoms of MS,lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or standard arthritis; losing the excess weightthat has caused them to become obese; or slowing the progress of cancer ordementia—the Plant Paradox program has been an agent of life-affirming changefor many individuals.Despite its popularity, however, I am also aware that The Plant Paradox is noeasy read. It focuses primarily on the scientific background of myresearch—chronicling the reasons for removing certain foods (those that containlectins or other harmful substances) and environmental toxins, and dissectingthe effects these substances have on your physiology.And so: my aim with The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy is to continue to help asmany people as possible with a companion book that offers a simplified versionof the program and focuses instead on more practical matters. I realize that itcan seem impossible, or at least improbable, to overhaul your diet and lifestylein the real world of two-job families, commutes, after-school practices,socializing, and likely not residing in Southern California as I do, where anabundance of fresh produce is available year-round. This book was designed withthese challenges in mind, and with the goal of helping you making healthy andsustainable changes as quickly and as easily as possible.If you’ve heard the buzz about The Plant Paradox but have been nervous abouttrying it—this book is the perfect bridge to the Plant Paradox lifestyle. Youdon’t need to have read the original book or know anything about lectins! Wewill review the basic science behind the program (a brief discussion, I promiseyou!) before moving into its application in the real world: from food prep andcooking hacks, to snack lists, to menus for entertaining, to shopping tips andtricks. I’ve also dedicated a chapter to special dietary considerations,offering modifications for those who are vegan or vegetarian, as well as thosewho follow a ketogenic diet or suffer from a serious illness. Moreover, ifyou’ve got kids, or just like to eat like a kid, I’ve given special attention tokid- and family-friendly Plant Paradox meals.And even if you’re a Plant Paradox veteran, I encourage you to try the 30-daychallenge. Yes, it means giving up a bit of freedom and going back to Phase1—but only for a week. I suggest you think of it like a cleanse or a reset:After going back to basics and detoxing completely from lectins, you will feel arenewed sense of energy and mental clarity. If you’ve been slipping up, arelooking to lose some weight, or just haven’t been feeling your best—the 30-dayprogram will help you to achieve the same results you first experienced on thePlant Paradox program.No matter what brings you to this book, my goal is the same: I truly want tomake it as simple as possible for you to try out this program and reclaim yourhealth. All it takes is a commitment to changing your diet and lifestyle for 30days. You have nothing to lose (but a few pounds)—and everything to gain."},{"pageContent":"PART 1GOING LECTIN-FREE [nav.xhtml#npa3]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1WHAT’S A LECTIN? [nav.xhtml#nch4]These days, it sometimes seems as though our society is obsessed with healthyeating. Fad diets and food trends come and go, and new superfoods make headlinesevery day. It’s not surprising, given the high incidence of disease and obesityin America—we are all looking for solutions to heal what ails us. While much ofthe advice we receive about how to eat is conflicting, across all nutritionalcamps and ideologies, there is one fact that just about everyone can agree on:Plants are the cornerstone of a healthy diet.I agree with this statement—in fact, I eat a primarily plant-based diet.However, there is a caveat. What I’ve learned over the past eighteen years as aclinician, researcher, and former medical school professor has led me to believethat the repercussions of eating plants are more complicated than many of usassume.In fact, I’ve determined that particular plants—like wheat, corn, soy, legumes,tomatoes, squash, and more—are actually harmful to your health. That’s becausethey contain a type of protein called a lectin. Lectins trigger a cascade ofdamaging effects in the body that lay the groundwork for illness. This is thecrux of what I call the Plant Paradox: While many, if not most plants arebeneficial, some can actually trigger disease.Simply put, I’ve discovered that eating a diet light in lectins supports guthealth and can even reverse disease. And the results have been astounding.Hundreds of my patients and thousands more who have followed the Plant Paradoxprogram have found that the symptoms of their illnesses vastly improve ordisappear altogether when they eliminate lectins from their diet. These folksinclude those diagnosed with diabetes; autoimmune diseases like rheumatoidarthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and celiacdisease; and gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohn’s disease and irritablebowel syndrome (IBS). Many have been able to reverse these diseases and are nowliving symptom-free.As a cardiac surgeon and cardiologist, I’ve had the opportunity to counsel mypatients to change their diet before going under the knife. As a result, many ofthem were able to forego surgery altogether. The majority of these patients wereable to stop taking their medications and, by closely monitoring their bloodmarkers, I’ve seen their inflammation abolished. Not to mention, they’ve enjoyedthe side benefit of naturally achieving a healthy weight. For someone who isused to helping heal patients on the operating table, I find healing throughfood to be miraculous. Since its original publication in 2017, The Plant Paradox has been translatedinto twenty-seven languages and its nutritional protocol has been adopted bymillions of people around the world. Once readers understand the “why” of ThePlant Paradox, they naturally turn to the “how”: How do I do this? Let’s faceit, the book is a heavy read. It’s loaded with research, references, and (thanksto my days as a professor) tons of nerdy science. I’ve heard from a lot ofpeople who are excited to try the program but are a little overwhelmed by theamount of information they first have to digest. Some have asked me for aversion that can be understood easily and implemented quickly. It’s like they’resaying, “Okay, Doc, I get it. No more lectins. Now please just tell me what tomake for dinner!”And so, here we are. I want to share this program with as many people aspossible, giving everyone the chance to clean up their cells, repair their gut,quell inflammation, and even lose a little weight in the process. And now, withthis quick and easy guide, it’s possible for anyone to jump right in.LECTINS 101As hard as it may be to imagine now, the Earth was once inhabited solely byplants. When insects arrived, about 340 million years ago, they shook thepeaceful plant ecosystem to its core. In no need of defense prior to insects’existence, plants suddenly needed to protect themselves, and their offspring,from being eaten. After all, plants have the same goals as the rest of us. Likeinsects and the animals that came after them, plants have an imperative toreproduce and to protect their young.But being plants, they typically cannot be on the offensive. Luckily for them,they have other ways of defending themselves: Mainly, causing injury to anycreature that eats them. Plants have short-term defenses, like immediatelypoisoning, paralyzing, or entrapping predators. They also have long-termdefenses, like making the creatures that eat them slowly become sick. Lectinsare a long-term defensive strategy. They are found in all plants, but highlyconcentrated in only a few. When eaten, these plants cause insects and higheranimals alike enough discomfort that they typically avoid consuming high-lectinfoods in the future.HOW DO LECTINS AFFECT OUR BODIES?To understand how lectins work as a survival strategy, we must look inside ourdigestive system, specifically to our gastrointestinal tract—also called the“gut.” Our gut wall—the lining that covers our intestines—is designed to keepcertain food particles inside the gut; these are later excreted as waste. Othervitamins, minerals, digested food, individual amino acids, fatty acids, andsugars can pass through the gut wall and into the bloodstream, nourishing us. Inaddition, the gut is home to millions of microbes (or as I call them, “gutbuddies”) that make up our microbiome. These microbes help us digest food andplay an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system. Their health iscritical to our own.The cells that line the inside of the gut wall produce mucus, which serves as anadditional barrier that keeps food particles where they belong. That mucus ismade up of a form of sugar called mucopolysaccharides. Believe it or not, whilethe surface area of your gut is equivalent to the size of a tennis court, thegut wall is only one cell thick. Imagine that such a vast and important barrieris protected by such a thin and vulnerable wall!When we consume a plant that contains lectins, the defense strategy ofbiological warfare begins. Lectins are large, sticky proteins that like to bindto sugars. The first step in their strategy is to pry apart what are called“tight junctions” in the mucosal lining of the gut. If your gut is healthy, alectin would have a difficult time pushing past the junctions in the mucosalbarrier. If, however, your mucus barrier has thinned—either from consuming agreat many lectins or from being exposed to other damaging influences (more onthis shortly)—lectins may attach to the lining of your gut wall. Once there,they trigger the production of a protein called zonulin, which serves as a keyto unlock the tight junctions. Think of it like the kids’ game of Red Rover,where everyone locks arms to prevent an opponent from running across to breakthrough the line. If two people get tired and stop linking arms, the opponent isable to get through the chain. Unfortunately, the tight junctions protectingyour gut don’t lock back together easily. Lectins create microscopic holes inthe gut wall, allowing other large molecules to leak through the barrier. Thislays the groundwork for a condition known as “leaky gut.”When the gut wall is compromised, there are several negative consequences. Firstis that lectins and any other molecules in the digestive tract are able tofreely enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. Those molecules includepieces of bacteria called lipopolysaccharides, or LPSs for short. I don’tnormally swear, but I can’t resist calling them “little pieces of shit,” becausethat’s literally what they are. Once in the bloodstream or the tissuesurrounding the gut, these intestinal escapees are identified by your immunesystem, which is always on patrol for invaders. Because your immune systemrecognizes them as foreign and considers them dangerous, it mounts an attack onthe offending molecules, resulting in widespread inflammation.When the body initiates such an immune response, white blood cells—the soldiersof the immune system—gather at the sites where LPSs are leaking from the gut.These soldiers need fuel for their fight, so your body stores energy—akafat—near the battle zone for easy access. When the inflammation is in your gut,the result is an accumulation of excess abdominal fat—which author andcardiologist William Davis famously termed a “wheat belly.” (Gluten is, as youmight have guessed by now, a type of lectin.)Even worse, when LPSs are continually leaking into the bloodstream, your immunesystem is engaged in a constant battle, resulting in widespread inflammation.This is traceable in lab work—most of my patients with leaky gut show highlevels of inflammatory cytokines (chemicals that alert your immune system to athreat) circulating in their blood, indicating that their immune system is onoverdrive and the inflammation is spreading throughout their bodies. Thisoveractive immune response sets the stage for autoimmune diseases.In autoimmune disease, the immune system attacks healthy cells of the body thatare not dangerous—it’s often termed as the body’s “friendly fire.” When yourimmune system is in overdrive, it is prone to overreaction and misidentifiesthreats. Loren Cordain, the father of the Paleo movement, first described thistype of mistaken identity as “molecular mimicry.” Lectins are particularlystealthy; their molecular makeup closely resembles that of other, harmlessproteins—such as those that make up your skin, joints, nerves, and thyroid. Youractivated immune system doesn’t want to miss any lectins, and it attacks thesenormal proteins in a case of mistaken identity. So not only is inflammationdriven by the LPSs leaking out of your gut, but the lectins themselves aredriving the friendly fire that turns the body against itself. By avoiding orneutralizing lectins in your diet, you remove the root cause of leaky gut andinflammation.You Are Not AloneYour gut buddies are just some of the hundreds of trillions of differentmicrobes—bacteria plus viruses, molds, and fungi—that live within yourintestinal tract, on your skin, and in other parts of the body. Takencollectively, they are known as your holobiome. These cells far outnumber yourhuman cells (90 percent of you is composed of foreign microbes), and they runthe show when it comes to everything from your immunity to your digestion toyour mood. Without our microbes, we could not live or function.The term “gut microbiome” refers specifically to the microbes that exist withinyour digestive tract. There is a reason I call them gut buddies—they are some ofthe best friends we could have. They digest and extract energy from our food sothat we can use it. They also act as sentinels for our immune system, alertingit to harmful things we eat—including lectins. Our gut buddies even help us tomaintain a healthy weight, and in fact, changes to the microbiome have beenlinked to excessive weight gain. As you will soon see when we discuss the SevenDeadly Disruptors, our gut buddies have taken a hit. A microbiome that is weakand damaged is less able to do all of its important jobs, and your healthsuffers as a result. In fact, a weakened microbiome has been linked to not onlyobesity but also diabetes, heart disease, and even dementia. On the PlantParadox program, we focus on eating more of the foods your gut buddies love andless of those they don’t. Because if you keep them happy, they will return thefavor!LIVING WITH LECTINS, THEN AND NOWHumans have been eating foods that contain lectins for millennia. So why are weonly now experiencing their damaging effects?One reason is that early humans ate fewer lectin-rich plants than we do today.But when the last Ice Age ended roughly ten thousand years ago, many of theanimals and plants that humans had relied on for sustenance disappeared. Ourancestors had to broaden their culinary horizons to avoid starvation, so theystarted planting and cultivating new crops. Grains and beans were two plantsthat were not only calorie-dense, but also could be stored for later use. So welearned how to plant our own food as well as how to store it to protect us intimes of scarcity. Win-win for our ancestors, right?Unfortunately, these particular new crops came with a hefty price. While theyprovided plentiful, precious calories, they were also rich in lectins. Our gutbuddies, suited and evolved to handle only the plants we had been eating formillions of years, didn’t stand a chance of being able to help us digest thesenew foods. And they still don’t. The time that has elapsed from the last Ice Ageto now—a mere ten thousand years—is not nearly long enough for our microbiome toevolve the ability to handle these foods.Additional trials came with the introduction of foods originating in theAmericas, also known as the “New World.” These crops included corn, squash,tomatoes, peppers, quinoa, and more. Native Americans had up to fifteen thousandyears of exposure to these plants and learned how to prepare them to reducelectin impact; however, African, Asian, and European populations have had lessthan five hundred years of exposure. Neither amount of time—five hundred yearsor fifteen thousand years—is at all sufficient for our bodies and gut buddies tofully adjust.What’s Old Is New AgainCoincidentally or not, traditional food preparations around the world have longhelped with the digestion of lectin-rich plants. In Asia, brown rice istypically stripped of its hull, creating white rice, which has significantlyfewer lectins. The same type of processing occurred in Europe with wheat; onereason why white flour used to be so prized was its ultimate digestibility. InItaly, the peels and seeds of vegetables, like those of peppers or tomatoes, forexample, were often removed prior to eating, which happens to be where much ofthe lectin load is concentrated. Fermentation, a process that is popular acrossmuch of Asia, reduces lectins and generates bacteria that is beneficial to thegut. We could all take a note from these cooking practices that have been usedaround the world for generations!THE DANGERS OF OUR MODERN FOOD SUPPLYWhile some changes to the human diet have taken place over millions of years,other shifts in the way we eat are quite recent. Over the past five decades,“innovations” to our food supply have created new threats to our health. Forexample, processed foods, which first gained popularity in the 1950s, are oftenmade from grains and oils that are high in lectins. We tend to over-rely oncertain foods that happen to be lectin-rich, like corn, soy, and wheat. Theseitems are also added to processed food as fillers or stabilizers, often to makefoods cheaper.Furthermore, many foods that are extremely high in lectins, such as tofu, wholegrains, brown rice, low-fat dairy products, and vegetable oils, are touted ashealth foods. As the obesity epidemic (which is directly related to eatingprocessed food) has reached a critical point, we’ve been increasingly encouragedto eat these foods, which, ironically, do more damage to our bodies than good.At the same time, we also don’t eat as many of the foods that are trulybeneficial to our gut buddies, like leafy greens and fermented vegetables.The animals we eat represent another facet of the problem. First of all, we eatmuch more meat now than ancient humans ever did. While we introduced significantamounts of animal protein into our diets around five million years ago, ourconsumption of plants goes back a lot farther than that. But putting aside thefact that we consume too much animal protein, the sources of that protein havealso changed. No longer are animals allowed to roam freely, eating the diet theyare genetically designed to eat. Today many of the animals we consume are fedcorn and soy—some of the biggest lectin offenders in existence. This diet is sounnatural to the animals that cows develop heartburn from it, just like humansdo. And just as our doctors prescribe medication to make us more comfortable,farmers douse their feed with calcium carbonate, the active ingredient in Tums.In the case of both humans and animals, “we are what we eat.” When we consumeany animal or animal product (e.g., dairy, eggs, etc.), we are also consumingwhat that animal has eaten. Eating lectins indirectly through animal productsinflicts significant damage on our gut, our microbiome, and our immune system.Finally, most of our animals today are given doses of antibiotics in their feedto make them grow bigger and fatter. Those antibiotic residues remain in themeat that you eat and decimate the friendly gut bugs that ultimately protectyou.As a side note, I was initially shocked when some of my patients were finallyable to resolve their autoimmune disease by giving up organic free-rangechicken. Let’s just say it doesn’t shock me anymore, since organic chickens arefed organic corn and soybeans, not their normal food which is insects. Thelectins in the corn and soybeans are incorporated into the chicken’s meat.Remember my motto: You are what you eat, but you are what the thing you areeating, ate!LECTINS AND WEIGHT GAINEating lectins not only harms your internal gut health—it also contributes tothe size of the gut around your waistline. There is ample evidence to suggestthat a diet high in lectins lays the groundwork for weight gain.There are a few reasons for this. One is that, as we’ve discussed, your bodystores fat near the gut to provide fuel for the immune system’s response to LPSsand lectins. Another reason is that eating foods treated with antibiotics—likeconventionally-raised meat, poultry, and fish—depletes the gut of beneficialmicrobes. And our gut buddies not only help us maintain a healthy weight, butthey are also essential to digest harmful lectins in the first place. When theyaren’t around to digest lectins for us, what do you think happens? You guessedit, the lectins force their way through the tight junctions in your gut wall andset themselves loose in your circulatory system, where they wreak inflammatoryhavoc.But there is another, even more insidious reason why you will gain weight whenconsuming lectin-rich foods—specifically “health” foods like whole grains. It’scalled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Contrary to popular belief, gluten is notthe most dangerous lectin found in wheat. WGA, which is found in the bran ofwheat, inflicts far more damage.WGA is an especially small protein compared with other lectins, which, as youknow, are relatively large. As a result, even if the gut barrier has not beencompromised, WGA can pass through more easily than other molecules. When itcomes to weight gain, one of WGA’s most potent effects is that it has theability to mimic insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone; the pancreasmanufactures and releases varying amounts of it in response to the amount ofsugar and protein you eat. Insulin helps regulate your blood sugar levels byacting as gatekeeper to your nerve cells (or neurons) and muscle cells,attaching to them and ordering them to let glucose in to provide fuel to thecell. (Insulin has a different effect on fat cells; it tells fat cells to turnglucose into fat if any extra glucose isn’t needed by the muscles and nerves.)Once the glucose has moved into the cell, the insulin detaches, making itpossible for the cell to receive messages from other hormones and chemicalmessengers. WGA mimics this activity, attaching to the same cells as insulin,but it never lets go.This creates a problem: The next time your gut releases glucose into yourbloodstream, the insulin that is produced doesn’t have any nerve or muscle cellsto attach to because WGA has occupied all of them. And because it doesn’t letgo, those cells—which are in need of fuel—can never be “unlocked” by theinsulin. On a neuron, for example, this means that the cell never gets theenergy it needs, and your desperate, hungry brain erroneously calls for you toconsume more calories. Even though you have likely eaten sufficient calories,your cells never get the message or the glucose they need. Therefore you eatexcess calories to quell your brain’s demands.WGA has long-term effects on your cells as well. When your occupied neurons gowithout the fuel they need, brain fog sets in. Similarly, attached WGA preventsmuscle cells from getting any glucose, which is needed for maintenance andgrowth, so your muscles waste away. But here’s the worst part: When WGA attachesto fat cells, it acts as a continuous insulin-like signal to store more energyfrom the glucose passing by.The combination of too many calories, brain fog, excess fat storage, and reducedmuscle mass leads to overweight bodies and sluggish brains. What to do? In anutshell (or should I say grain hull?): Stop eating whole grains. It’scounterintuitive, but true. Were you really enjoying all that brown rice and 100percent whole-wheat toast anyway?THE SEVEN DEADLY DISRUPTORSOur twenty-first-century lifestyle has waged war on our health—and inparticular, our gut health—in many ways we don’t always stop to consider. Inaddition to the food we eat, a number of environmental, medicinal, andtechnological “advances” have contributed to the degradation of our microbiome,setting the stage for illness to take root.I call these modern developments the Seven Deadly Disruptors, as they wreakhavoc on the quantity (total number of) and diversity (variety of) of our gutbuddies—our only natural defense against lectins. These are substances that manypeople use or consume every day without a second thought. They include thingsthat we’ve been told for decades are “good” for us. You can find much moredetail on the Seven Deadly Disruptors in The Plant Paradox, but for our purposeshere, I’ll keep it brief: 1. BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS. While antibiotics can be life-saving drugs, killing or inhibiting harmful bacteria, they can also decimate your population of supportive bacteria. It doesn’t help that we have gotten into the habit of taking antibiotics too frequently. Sometimes we even consume them unknowingly, like when we eat conventionally-raised meat. Animals raised on such farms are fed antibiotics to help them stay alive and to fatten them up for slaughter. As I mentioned earlier, you are what you eat, so eating an animal whose diet includes antibiotics means you consume those medications as well. In addition to decimating our gut buddies, antibiotics will cause weight gain in you just like it did in the animals you ate. 2. NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS). Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib (Celebrex) are some of the popular pain relievers that fall under the category of NSAIDs. Aspirin had long been the pain medication of choice, but around the 1970s it was discovered that prolonged use of the drug was damaging to the stomach lining. These observations were noted using a gastroscope—a tool that doctors use to inspect the digestive system from the inside—which made it clear that too much aspirin was harmful to the stomach and that NSAIDS did not cause any such problems. Drug companies and doctors alike were thrilled to have these new pain medications that would eliminate the risk of damage to the stomach lining. What they didn’t know then—because gastroscopes are unable to see the digestive system beyond the stomach—is that NSAIDs damage the lining of the small intestine and colon. Lectins, as you may remember, also target this area. Ironically, when you regularly take NSAIDs (which are described as “anti-inflammatory”) the damage they cause to your intestinal wall leads to more inflammation. This leads to more pain, which causes you to keep reaching for NSAIDs. It’s a cycle that obviously does more damage than good, except for pharmaceutical companies’ bottom lines. 3. STOMACH-ACID BLOCKERS. Acid-blocking drugs like Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, or Protonix, most of which are proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. This may seem like a good thing, but stomach acid is an essential tool your body uses to neutralize harmful bacteria and break up lectins. And the more bad bacteria you have, the less room and resources your good bacteria have. Furthermore, these acid reducers make it increasingly possible to continue eating the lectin-rich foods that cause the original problem. In other words, we’ve created a faulty workaround for plants’ defensive systems. Instead of learning to avoid foods that cause discomfort, as animals do (and as plants intended us to do), we don’t always make the connection between diet and disease. PPIs also inhibit protein digestion. Since lectins are plant proteins, more PPIs mean more lectins on the loose. 4. ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. As a former Diet Coke addict (eight cans a day!), I am especially horrified to discuss how harmful artificial sweeteners are. Artificial sweeteners not only decimate your friendly bacterial population, but they also trigger your brain to seek more sweets and store fat for the winter (which, as you will see in Chapter 2 [Chapter_2_The_Plant_Parad.xhtml], is also what eating fruit will do). It’s no coincidence that when I was drinking so much calorie-free soda I was also seventy pounds overweight. With fewer gut buddies, ingested lectins wreak even more havoc inside your body. 5. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the normal functioning of your hormones. Exposure to them is linked to an array of health issues including diabetes, cancer, poor thyroid function, reproductive problems (for men and women), and obesity. Endocrine disruptors also affect the liver. One of the liver’s key roles is converting vitamin D into its active form; vitamin D is vital to keeping the wall of your intestine intact. A low vitamin D level can also make you more susceptible to illnesses like autoimmune diseases, dementia, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Endocrine disruptors are commonly found in plastics, personal care items (including sunscreen, hand sanitizers, and toothpaste), household cleaners, pesticides, food packaging, cling wrap, food storage containers, and many other everyday products. Many processed foods also contain them as an additive meant to reduce spoilage and provide other helpful “benefits.” Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is a common chemical stabilizing agent and endocrine disruptor; it is often found in packaged bread, especially the whole grain varieties. Avoid it at all costs! You can find a list of common endocrine disruptors and tips for avoiding them in Chapter 4. [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml] 6. GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND THE HERBICIDE ROUNDUP. In addition to likely causing all sorts of health problems (check the news and you’ll be busy for a long time), Roundup, the most common biocide, depletes your friendly gut bacteria. Avoiding Roundup used to be possible by simply avoiding genetically modified foods (also called “genetically modified organisms” or GMOs). Since GMOs are specifically bred to withstand the herbicide known as glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup, they could be doused with it as a means for farmers to control weeds without killing the crop. But now Roundup is used as a desiccant on non-GMO versions of these same plants—almost all oats, grains, beans, and legumes—because a dried-up, dead plant is easier to harvest. Whoever eats the crop—whether it’s you, your kids, or the animals you later consume—will be treated to a hearty dose of Roundup. While you will largely avoid legumes on the Plant Paradox program, there are options to include pressure-cooked beans in moderation, and to eat limited amounts of animal protein. The only way to avoid Roundup is to eat exclusively organic versions of these foods and, in the case of meats, to eat only pasture-raised and -finished animal products or wild fish and shellfish. 7. BLUE LIGHT. Our bodies are finely tuned to react to the light we perceive via our optic nerves. Different kinds of light signal to our brain and our body when to sleep, when to eat, and how much fat to burn or store. Blue light is part of the light spectrum that comprises daylight; when we are exposed to excess blue light, our bodies start to confuse daytime and nighttime. In summer, the longer days and coinciding extra blue light stimulate our bodies to store fat and hoard calories in preparation for the coming winter, when food was typically scarce. In winter, with shorter days, our body burns its own fat stores because, in the past, calories from food were generally reduced. Today we live in the glare of our electronic devices—from phones and computers to TVs and tablets—as well as the fluorescent and LED lighting in our homes and offices, all of which emit blue light. Exposure to blue light year-round tricks our bodies into thinking it’s summertime all the time. Thus we are continually “preparing for winter,” mistakenly consuming more calories and storing fat rather than burning it.Many of the Seven Deadly Disruptors—like antibiotics and NSAIDS—are disguised asmedical advances, which treat the symptoms of a health issue but disregard theorigins. This is effective in the short term, but it doesn’t get to the root ofthe problem; furthermore it reinforces the choices that create these problems inthe first place. Other disruptors—like artificial sweeteners, GMOs, andRoundup—are presented as solutions to issues like sugar dependency or difficultfarming practices. This seemingly beneficial purpose conceals their negativeside effects. Still other disruptors are merely problematic by-products of oursocieties’ technological advances. But whether blatant or hidden in plain sight,these disruptors harm our gut health—and thus, our overall health.PLANT PARADOX TO THE RESCUEThis brief tour through the world of lectins might feel dizzying. Between theSeven Deadly Disruptors and the changes to our food supply, I agree that it is alot to take in. But before we begin to make the changes that will heal your gutand improve your health, I want you to understand what you’re up against andwhat’s at stake. You can create a new way of living that offers increasinglypositive effects on your health—from eliminating pesky symptoms like bloatingand brain fog, to preventing and reversing serious diseases.If you’re worried that it’s too late for you, please don’t be. Our bodies areever changing. For example, in just ninety days, 90 percent of our cells arecompletely replaced. Out intestinal lining regenerates completely every fewdays! This means that making adjustments to your diet can have an almostimmediate impact on your well-being. Eating lectin-free doesn’t directly fix gutproblems, but it eliminates the barriers that have been separating you from goodhealth so your body can begin to heal itself.By following this condensed and simplified version of the original Plant Paradoxprogram, you can start accruing benefits right away. All-new recipes, pantrylists, and detailed meal plans and schedules make it easy to jump right in.Before you know it your gut buddies will multiply, your weight will normalize,and your mind will clear. You’ll be off and running to a new and healthier you.Whether you are a longtime Plant Paradox fan or a newcomer to the program, ThePlant Paradox Quick and Easy will kick-start your weight loss and help you reapthe health benefits of living lectin-free."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE PLANT PARADOX PROGRAM [nav.xhtml#nch5]In my many active years as a heart surgeon and cardiologist, I saw my patientsstruggle with their health and weight. Many suffered from a spectrum of healthissues, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, autoimmune conditions,diabetes, and obesity. I spent decades trying my best to help them, but I wasoften frustrated by the limits of medicine. Too often these folks ended up on myoperating table—or that of another specialist—not just once, but again andagain. There had to be a better way.In all honesty, it took my own struggle to realize that the prevailing wisdom Ioffered to my patients wasn’t working. I had been seventy pounds overweight andhad some suboptimal markers for disease. At the time, I thought I was doingeverything right—I exercised frequently and consumed a reduced-sugar diet filledwith whole grains and low-fat dairy. But I wasn’t getting better. And withoutmedication and surgery, neither were my patients.I had been in conventional medicine for more than twenty years when I changedcourse. By that point, I’d graduated from Yale University with honors, receivedmy medical degree from the Medical College of Georgia, entered thecardiothoracic surgery program at the University of Michigan, and received afellowship in research at the National Institutes of Health. After sixteen yearsas a professor and head of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda UniversitySchool of Medicine, I was coming to the conclusion that in order to continue mymedical work, and to keep learning and growing, I had to shift gears.It was around this time that I made some changes to my diet and started losingweight and feeling a lot better. My blood tests looked a lot better, too. Thechanges to my health inspired me to go in a new direction: I wanted to pursuethe idea that perhaps nutrition could reverse heart disease and replace the needfor surgery. It occurred to me that I was thinking myself out of my job, but Icouldn’t have been more excited.Soon thereafter I established the International Heart and Lung Institute—andwithin it, the Center for Restorative Medicine—in Palm Springs and SantaBarbara, California. There, I got to work on nonsurgical solutions to heartdisease. The seeds of the Plant Paradox were born. My experience as a transplantimmunologist, in addition to cardiologist and heart surgeon, informed my beliefthat the foods we consume and avoid have a considerable effect on our health. Mycardiac, diabetic, obese, and other patients experienced life-changing resultson the nutritional protocol I developed. Not happy to leave well enough alone, Ibecame obsessed with figuring out why and how this diet was having such apositive effect. I dug further into research and reexamined my undergraduatethesis on the influence of food and environment on human evolution. I tinkeredwith the lists of “allowed” and “restricted” foods I’d devised. Then I developedan extensive panel of blood work to monitor my patient’s progress, and I poredover their health histories until patterns emerged. The result of this endeavoris the Plant Paradox.The Plant Paradox program takes my findings—starting with the belief thatlectins are harmful to our bodies—and offers a diet and lifestyle protocolanyone can follow. The goal is twofold: first, to give your immune system andyour gut a chance to recover from the assault and heal themselves; and second,to nourish your body with the foods it needs to maintain health and vitality. Wecan achieve that goal by eating more of the foods that nourish our gut microbes,and fewer of the foods that decimate them and create holes in the intestinalwall. And the result? Everything from increased energy levels and elevated mood,to elimination of disease and effortless weight loss.The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy offers a simplified version of this program.And it is designed to get you going immediately so you can start reaping thebenefits without obsessing over the details.DIFFERENTIATING THE PLANT PARADOX FROM FAD DIETSHere is what the Plant Paradox program is not: a restrictive fad diet designedfor dramatic weight loss. If you are looking to temporarily fit into a smallerpair of jeans, this may not be the right program for you. While there are plentyof weight-loss benefits to this program, it is a way of eating that most of mypatients have adopted for life, as the benefits multiply the longer youparticipate. Think of the daily health inconveniences that you might assume yousimply have to live with: allergies, acne, and memory loss, to name a few. ThePlant Paradox program can eliminate these issues and also resolve seriousdiseases. This is what makes it the opposite of a fad diet. I have been on theprogram for nineteen years and, as a result, I have lost seventy pounds and nolonger have high blood pressure, migraine headaches, arthritis, highcholesterol, or insulin resistance.There are three stages of the program, each designed to support what your bodyneeds and how you react to the dietary changes. Phase 1 is the most restrictive.It is similar to a cleanse; its purpose is to detoxify and reboot your system.Phase 2 repairs the gut and feeds your microbiome the foods it needs to gethealthy, while also recalibrating your weight. Phase 3 is the maintenance stage.It helps you stay healthy over the long term, and offers fast and safe ways toreintroduce some lectin-containing foods back into your life.While the protocol isn’t limiting in the same way as, for instance, acabbage-soup diet, there are a few rules of the game. I promise that once youunderstand the reasoning behind them, following these rules will feel less likea limitation and more like a gift you are giving yourself. Really! It feelsgreat to be kind to your body and your gut buddies, and to receive theirappreciation in terms of how you feel on a day-to-day basis. When you have ahealthy body and gut buddies working at their full potential, you will neverwant to go back to your old ways.THE FOUR RULES FOR SUCCESS ON THE PLANT PARADOX PROGRAMHere are the guidelines of the Plant Paradox program. While I will providespecific lists of “Yes, Please” and “No, Thank You” foods, a variety of recipes,and a thirty-day plan, it’s still useful to keep these four basic rules in mind.Even in the quick and easy version of the program, it is helpful to have somebroad guidance on what you should and shouldn’t eat, and why.RULE # 1: What You Stop Eating Has Far More Impact on Your Health Than What YouStart EatingI am a strong believer in Hippocrates’s dictum that “all disease begins in thegut.” Furthermore, I think that most people today eat foods that causesignificant damage to the gut, whether they rely on highly processed junk food,or nosh on “healthy” foods, like brown rice, fruit, beans, and conventionaldairy products. But unlike a typical diet that focuses on what foods you shouldeat more of, the Plant Paradox program takes a different approach. The centralidea is that it’s much more important to remove the foods that are doing themost damage to you, rather than to espouse the benefits of x or y superfood. Inthis case, philosophically, less is more. Once you remove those big-timeoffenders from your daily intake (see the “No, Thank You” list[Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#ah2-L4]), your gut will have a chance to healitself. Another way to take a break from these offenders is to includeintermittent fasting in your weekly routine. This is what the Plant Paradoxprogram is all about—removing the roadblocks so your body has an opportunity toheal itself.RULE # 2: Pay Attention to the Care and Feeding of Your Gut Buddies, and TheyWill Handle the Care and Feeding of You. After All, You Are Their Home.As you now know, there is a war taking place inside of our bodies. Your gut isthe battlefield, and your gut buddies are on the front lines, taking hit afterhit. Years of using antibiotics, antacids, and NSAIDs, plus consuming ahigh-fat, high-sugar, pesticide-rich Western diet have decimated theonce-thriving ecosystem within our bodies. Our good gut microbes areincapacitated, unable to do the important work they are meant to do. With that,dangerous microbes have taken over, and actually thrive on (and demand!) thejunkiest of foods—like sugar, refined carbs, and saturated fat.Becoming conscientious about what you are feeding your gut buddies means thatyou can flip the balance back—starving off the bad bugs and nursing the goodbugs back to health. You may be surprised to find that when balance has beenrestored you will naturally start craving the greens and other foods your gutbuddies thrive on.RULE # 3: Fruit Might as Well Be CandyNews flash: Fruit is not a health food. Studies have shown that fructose, thesugar found in fruit, inflicts serious damage on your kidneys and liver.Consuming fruit also sends a signal to our bodies to store fat. Our modernsociety, with its imported peaches and greenhouse berries, has access to fruityear-round. But for our ancestors, fruit was exclusively a summertime treat.When you eat fruit, your brain gets the message that it’s time to store fat forwinter’s leaner times.Another pesky note about fruit: I’m not just talking about apples and orangeshere. Anything with seeds is a fruit, so the list of foods to avoid includes“vegetables” like tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant, peppers, chilies, cucumbers,squash, and more. There are two sets of exceptions to the fruit restriction. Thefirst is unripe bananas, mangoes, and papayas, which contain starches that haveyet to turn into fructose, and are therefore a delicious treat for our gutbuddies. These are surprisingly flexible ingredients in your kitchen. Forexample, shredded green papaya makes a wonderful base for a Thai-inspired salad,and green banana flour can be used in all sorts of baked goods. The otherexception to the fruit restriction is ripe avocados. Avocados have no sugar, andtheir beneficial soluble fiber and good fat—oleic acid, the same fat in oliveoil—help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants, providing a naturalboon to the digestive system. Try drizzling half an avocado with olive oil and asprinkling of sea salt—or, heck, eating the whole thing.The Plant Paradox program isn’t about calorie counting or deprivation. The goalis not to eliminate how much you eat overall, but rather to eliminate the foodsthat harm your gut and enjoy the ones that support your health. (And in fact,eating one avocado a day has been shown to help with weight loss!)RULE # 4: You Are What the Things You Are Eating AteAs we discussed in Chapter 1 [Chapter_1_Whats_a_Lectin.xhtml], over the pastcouple of generations eating animals and animal products has gotten much morecomplicated. Cows, pigs, and chickens are raised in vast numbers, and are givenfeed that doesn’t at all resemble their natural diet. Most factory farms rely onlectin-rich corn, soy, or wheat, because it’s cheap, plentiful, and easy tostore. You may be careful to not eat corn, soy, and wheat products, but if youeat conventionally-raised meats or other animal products you are ingesting thosesame lectins indirectly. You can be vigilant about reading ingredient labels forhigh-lectin offenders, but meat and other animal products do not list the“ingredients” (i.e., the feed) that was fed to the poultry and cows thatsupplied your eggs, cheese, milk, yogurt, and turkey burger.In addition, because the diet and miserable housing conditions in theseindustrial settings isn’t natural, the animals require antibiotics and othermedicines just to survive. Those chemicals are present in the livestock’s meat,eggs, and milk, so when we eat those products, we consume the animals’ medicinesas well. We are what we eat—and so are the foods we eat.Another thing to be careful of is labeling that sounds safe. “Free-range”doesn’t guarantee a chicken is outside eating bugs and grass. “Grass-fed”doesn’t mean a cow ate grass all its life; it can mean that it ate grass for aweek and then spent the rest of its life eating corn and soybeans in a feedlot.(See Chapter 4 [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#bh2-L5] for more information onfood labels.) Instead, look for labels that say pastured and/or grass-fed andgrass-finished.These four rules are embedded in every part of the Plant Paradox program. Learnthem and follow them, and you will discover a new level of health andwell-being.DIFFERENTIATING THE PLANT PARADOX FROM THE USDA’S NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINESCHAP002_002_9780062911995.jpg [CHAP002_002_9780062911995.jpg]The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotionpublishes their recommendations for a healthy diet, and most of us are familiarwith those recommendations in their iconic “food pyramid.” As you can see above,the base of the pyramid is composed of starches: bread, rice, grains, and pasta.The second tier, smaller, is also divided in half, with fruits on one side andvegetables on the other. Above that, smaller still, are two equal halves showingdairy products (yogurt, milk, and cheese) and meats, eggs, and legumes. Thetip-top of the pyramid, the smallest section of all, contains fats.Suffice it to say, the Plant Paradox is not compliant with the USDA’srecommendations. To put it even more strongly, the government’s nutritionalguidance is about the worst you can follow if you’re trying to avoid lectins.Its heavy reliance on grains subjects your body to deadly disruptors, foodpreservatives, additives like corn syrup and food dye, and lectins—especiallygluten and, the most irksome, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA).A large portion of the USDA pyramid is dedicated to fruit, which is problematicbecause fruit consumption cues the body to store fat for the winter. Thevegetable section does not differentiate the distinctive varieties, such asnightshades versus leafy or cruciferous plants. Vegetables in the nightshadefamily—which includes peppers, tomatoes, and eggplant—are fruits masquerading asvegetables—they are full of lectins. This group also includes starchy plantslike potatoes (technically, a nightshade), which function in the body more likegrains than plants and are not recommended.The conventional dairy products and eggs in the pyramid come from animals thathave been fed lectin-rich diets, making them rich in lectins too. Most dairyproducts in the United States also contain the lectin-like protein casein A1,rather than the safe casein A2, which is found in goats, sheep, and SouthernEuropean cows. Finally, the USDA lists fats without any classification,eschewing them as food that makes us fat or clogs our arteries. All fats arerecommended only in great moderation. Take it from a cardiologist: Not all fatsare created equal.The Plant Paradox Food Pyramid below offers a radically different approach tohow we think about food groups and nutrients.CHAP002_001_9780062911995.jpg [CHAP002_001_9780062911995.jpg]As you can see, the base of the pyramid, which includes foods so beneficial thatyou can eat them in unlimited quantities, is reserved for healthy fats. Theseinclude avocados and approved oils (olive, walnut, sesame, and coconut amongthem), as well as leafy and cruciferous vegetables like lettuces, spinach,broccoli, and brussels sprouts.The next-largest section, oddly, is for nothing at all. Intermittent fasting isa beneficial habit for humans, giving our digestive system a much-needed break.I recommend restricting calories one or two days a week, or eating only betweenrestricted hours of the day, so your meal times fall within a daily 8-hourperiod. (We will explore intermittent fasting in more detail in Chapter 3[Chapter_3_How_It_Works.xhtml#ah3-L4].)In the middle of the Plant Paradox pyramid we find modest consumption of certainnuts (such as almonds and macadamia), lectin-free grains (sorghum and millet),lectin-free flours (such as coconut and almond), and resistant starches. Furtherup the pyramid, pastured chicken and eggs, wild-caught seafood, and in-seasonfruit can also be eaten in moderation. Less frequently, you can enjoy dairy fromgoats, sheep, buffalo, and Southern European cows. Lastly, you can indulge inchocolate, wine, dark spirits, and pastured, grass-fed beef once or twice aweek.If you have been following the USDA’s suggestions, this new way of eating maytake some getting used to. Fortunately, the Plant Paradox food pyramid offers ahandy visual reference of what your diet should generally look like.THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE PLANT PARADOXMy main goal as a medical practitioner is to help people lead healthier lives.As a cardiac surgeon, I was brought into the most dire health situations—when ahuman heart had become diseased or congested—and was able to make repairs. If anartery were clogged, for example, I could physically create a workaround,inserting a stent or bypass that would facilitate blood flow. I saw illness inthe body as a problem that I was given the ability to fix, and I was proud ofthat work. I still am.But my perspective has changed. In some ways, the medical field has distortedthe way we conceptualize disease. Many people now consider it a phenomenon thatindividuals cannot control—one that medical personnel exclusively are able toremedy or not. I now see that most if not all health concerns are better fixedat the root of the problem, and this is achieved through careful considerationof the food and other environmental factors your body is exposed to.Once given direction, this is work the patient is able to do—and that is veryempowering. The human body is a remarkable and intricate system and is, in mostways, capable of self-healing. But these abilities are not always exercisedbecause the immune system, where much of the healing work is done, isoverwhelmed with false alarms. This internal chaos is caused by the body’simmediate environment—driven by diet and lifestyle choices—which then leads toconfused internal communication. This faulty internal messaging causesimmunologic and hormonal firestorms that result in an array of health issues.As a transplant immunologist, I have researched immune disease for more thanforty years. What I failed to completely understand, until I developed the PlantParadox, was that if our capable and sophisticated immune system is stimulatedin the wrong ways, it has the ability to cause as many problems as it fixes. Butsimilarly, if people treat their bodies right, restore a functional microbiome,and repair their leaky guts, the immune system can fix many problems itself.That is the purpose of the immune system! I now understand that our immunesystem doesn’t need fixing; we need to stop breaking it.By following the Plant Paradox program, my patients are able to eliminateharmful stimuli, specifically, a diet rich in lectins; a lifestyle that includesNSAIDS, excessive antibiotics, artificial sweeteners; and other disruptors.Therefore, our immune systems, and the gut buddies that guide it, can proceedwith the work they are meant to do: regulating our systems and keeping ushealthy.Once our bodies are able to finally get off the roller coaster of exposure to adamaging diet and deadly disruptors, it is amazing how beautifully they can healthemselves. I have seen patients resolve the following health problems: * Aching joints * Acid reflux or heartburn * Acne * Age spots, skin tags * Allergies * Alopecia * Anemia * Arthritis * Asthma * Autoimmune diseases (including autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, colitis, and lupus) * Bone loss (including osteopenia and osteoporosis) * Brain fog * Cancer * Canker sores * Chronic fatigue syndrome * Chronic pain syndrome * Colon polyps * Cramps, tingling, and numbness * Dementia * Dental problems * Depression * Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance * Exhaustion * Fat in the stool (due to poor digestion) * Fibromyalgia * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett’s esophagus * Gastrointestinal problems (bloating, pain, gas, constipation, diarrhea) * Headaches * Heart disease, coronary artery disease, vascular disease * Hypertension * Infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, miscarriage * Irritability and behavioral changes * Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) * Low counts of immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A * Low testosterone * Low white blood cell count * Lymphomas, leukemias, multiple myeloma * Male-pattern baldness * Memory loss * Migraine headaches * Nutritional deficiencies due to malabsorption (e.g., low iron levels) * Parkinson’s disease * Peripheral neuropathy * Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) * Skin rashes (including dermatitis herpetiformis, eczema, and psoriasis) * Slow infant and child growth * Unexplained bouts of dizziness or ear ringing * Vitiligo * Weight loss or weight gainTHE WEIGHT LOSS BENEFITS OF THE PLANT PARADOXNot everyone who follows the Plant Paradox program is looking for relief from adisease or illness. Some are looking for a way to improve their general healthand well-being. While it was not my original intention, the program does have awonderful side benefit: achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.How does the Plant Paradox program help you lose weight? The answer is twofold.First, the body is able to achieve equilibrium because a properly balancedmicrobiome makes it much easier to achieve a healthy weight. Remember, your gutbuddies break down your food into manageable molecules, consequently controllingwhat and how much of your intake is processed as nutrients and discarded aswaste. Therefore, if your digestive tract contains sufficient gut buddies(rather than an overflow of bad bacteria), your food will be processed accordingto what your body needs, and order will be restored.Restoring balance to the gut means you need to keep the good bacteria happy andalso eliminate the bad ones (at least the excess bad ones—there will always besome hanging around). A lectin-free diet and a conscientious, proactive approachto avoiding disruptors will tamp down the population of harmful gut bugs andallow your digestive system to restore your good gut bugs.Avoiding WGA especially will prevent your body from creating additional,unneeded fat cells. The notion that an ideal weight can be reached on theprinciple of balancing calories in and calories out is simply and completelywrong. Rather, it is the makeup of your microbiome that determines how manycalories are extracted from food and passed onto your cells, and how much foodwill be eliminated as waste. Overwhelming evidence supports the idea that thebad bugs command you—via neurotransmitters found in the gut that communicatedirectly with the brain—to eat the food they thrive on, including simple sugars,junk food, and saturated fats. Like I said in The Plant Paradox, if you findyourself making poor food choices again and again, it’s not your fault. Your badmicrobes are making you do it!The second way you will lose weight on this program stems from healing thedamage to the gut caused by lectins. When the leaky holes in the gut wall arepatched, your body’s immune system can begin to quiet down. Remember, anoveractive immune response cues your body to store fat, which in turn makes yougain weight. When you eliminate the source of the attack, the immune system nolonger needs to store fuel for the fight."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3HOW IT WORKS [nav.xhtml#nch6]THE 30-DAY CHALLENGEThe 30-day challenge is an accelerated version of the original Plant Paradoxprogram, but doesn’t differ in its goals. It is still meant to reboot ourdigestive system, decrease stress on our immune system, and achieve a healthy,natural weight. In thirty days, you will cycle through all three stages of theprogram—one week for Phase 1, two weeks for Phase 2, and the final week forPhase 3.In Chapter 7 [Chapter_7_Weekly_Meal_Pla.xhtml], you will find menus for eachphase of the plan, covering a full thirty days of eating. While you are welcometo customize or mix and match what you eat, I put together this meal plan sothat you could, if you wish, simply print out the pages, attach them to yourfridge, and get started on your Plant Paradox journey. You will also findinformation about when to begin supplements and how to eliminate disruptors. Andbecause I know it’s not feasible to make every meal from scratch, I’ve alsoincluded numerous tips for batch cooking and prepping meals in advance.I’ve also included the information my patients have been requesting over thelast few years—snack lists, pantry staples, kitchen equipment, even a list offoods and products to banish from the house so you’re not tempted to slip up. Ihave designed this program to make it as easy as possible for you to golectin-free and start reaping the results immediately.Depending on how you feel and what progress you’ve made by the end of thirtydays, you will likely opt to stay in Phase 3 for a lifetime so that you cancontinue to maintain your health. Let’s get started!Phase 1: Kick StartThe first seven days of the program are focused on rebooting your microbiome.The goal is to start repairing your gut, fortifying the good microbes, andbanishing the bad microbes.This will be the most restrictive period of the thirty days. The following foodsare off-limits: dairy, legumes, grains, fruit (except avocado), sugar, eggs,soy, nightshade vegetables. Plus, you’ll steer clear of conventionally-raisedmeats or their products, and avoid the following oils: corn, soy, canola, andother vegetable oils. Eliminating these foods will starve the bad gut bugs, soyour gut can begin to heal. The good news is that every day you can eat tons oforganic vegetables from the “Yes, Please” list, as well as the following:avocado (up to one a day); small amounts (no more than eight ounces) ofwild-caught fish or seafood, pastured chicken, grain-free tempeh, hemp tofu, andcertain Quorn products; healthy fats (i.e., olive oil, macadamia nut oil, walnutoil, avocado oil, ghee, medium-chain triglycerides [also called MCT oil],coconut oil, perilla oil); approved nuts; any type of tea; and coffee.To further assist your body to clean out your intestines, you may also take amild (preferably herbal) laxative on the evening of the first day, which willaid in the removal of harmful microbes. There are also some supplements that arehelpful to take at this time if you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),leaky gut, or any autoimmune condition. They include: berberine, grapefruit seedextract, and mushroom extracts (see Chapter 6[Chapter_6_Special_Conside.xhtml#bh10-L5] for more information).I admit, this first week can be challenging, and you may not be in the best moodand/or feel downright cranky or tired. But the physical results are quick andpositive. If you need to lose weight, you will likely lose a few pounds rightaway. And no matter what your weight, your gut will be in a much better statethan it was before you started. It gets much easier from here!Phase 2: Repair and RestoreFor the next two weeks, you’ll be concentrating on repairing and restoring yourgut. By now your cravings for unhealthy foods should be subsiding, plus Phase 2is less restrictive than Phase 1, so it should be getting easier to stick withthe plan. I ask that during this time you start paying attention to otherfactors that affect your gut health, and make necessary changes to the productsyou use on a daily basis that might be hurting your microbiome.In Phase 2, your gut buddies regain control of your microbiome (driving out thebad guys) and your immune system calms down. Normally people experience alifting of brain fog, regular bowel movements, clearer skin, less-achy joints,more energy, and better sleep, although some people may not feel these effectsfor another week or two. Don’t despair if you aren’t one of the earlyresponders. Some of us need much longer to seal our leaky gut and banish thosepesky bad bugs. Your weight should be affected positively as well.If you feel like you need a little more time in this phase, do not feel like youmust move to Phase 3 after two weeks. In fact, if you grabbed this book becauseyou have chronic health issues, I urge you to stay on Phase 2 for a whilelonger. Many of my long-term patients with more serious health problems neverleave Phase 2, and never want or need to progress to Phase 3.In Phase 2 you can still eat all of the foods you ate in Phase 1, and you willstill be focused on consuming lots of leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, andapproved fats. Additionally, you can add the following to your diet: tubers,roots, pastured or omega-3–fortified eggs, and resistant-starch foods like greenbananas, mangoes, and papayas. These foods are fuel for your gut buddies, as arePhase 2 veggies like parsnips, turnips, jicama, celery root, and Jerusalemartichokes. A moderate amount of these new foods is best. They are very healthy,but can also lead to weight gain if you over-rely on them.Now is also the time to introduce fun foods to help banish carb cravings. Theseinclude shirataki noodles, millet and sorghum, and various alternative flours,which you can use for baked goods. Sheep- and goat-milk dairy products likeyogurts or kefir are also okay now, as is coconut milk and coconut yogurt.Please avoid cow’s milk yogurts and Greek yogurts (they are not from Greece!).You can now eat limited amounts of dairy from Southern European cows (which makecasein A-2 protein) or from sheep, goats, and water buffalo. One ounce per dayis fine (that’s about a one-inch-square piece of cheese). And feel free to havea one-ounce piece of chocolate daily, as long as it is greater than 72 percentcacao. Too bitter? Remember one of my sayings: More bitter, more better!It’s also time to start actively eliminating disruptors. That means none of thefollowing: genetically modified organisms (GMOs), nonorganic foods, artificialsugars, or many saturated animal fats. Phase 2 is also time to avoid endocrinedisruptors, like those found in plastic food packaging and household cleaners,and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a common chemical stabilizing agent found inprocessed food like packaged bread and crackers. With your health practitioner’sguidance, I also urge you to stop taking antibiotics, drugs that block stomachacid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), if possible.On the supplement front, Phase 2 is when I suggest starting to take fish oil oralgal DHA capsules before each meal. I also recommend taking 5,000 to 10,000 IUsper day of vitamin D3. See Chapter 6 [Chapter_6_Special_Conside.xhtml#ah4-L4]for more information about supplements to take on the Plant Paradox program.Phase 3: MaintenancePhase 3 comes early in the Plant Paradox Quick and Easy plan. In the originalPlant Paradox plan, I recommend staying in Phase 2 for at least six weeks. Butto kick-start your experience, I give you permission to move onto Phase 3 forthe last week of the month, especially if you are experiencing the benefits ofPhase 2 and feel consistently healthier and better. Phase 3 is about making thePlant Paradox program less of a regimen and more of a lifestyle. It’s time tomake the rules work for you in the long-term. In reality, this phase should lastmuch longer than a week—my hope is that it lasts a lifetime.In Phase 3 you can increase your intake of extra virgin olive oil, but watch thecoconut oil, especially if you are among the 30 percent of the population whocarries the ApoE4 gene. For people who test positive for this gene, saturatedfats pose an elevated risk for long-term cardiovascular and brain health. Nomatter what your genetic profile, I recommend eating no more than two to fourounces of animal protein (including fish) a day. You will get plenty of proteinfrom the nuts, leaves, and mushrooms in the rest of your diet.If you have been in general good health before starting this program, you canalso begin to reintroduce limited amounts of lectin-containing foods that havebeen treated or processed to reduce their lectin load. This includes foods likepressure-cooked beans and white basmati rice, peeled and seeded tomatoes, andbaby cucumbers, eggplant, and zucchini. I suggest reintroducing these foodsslowly, so you can gauge your body’s reaction to each of them. Some may be finein small quantities, but others may not agree with you and your newly healedgut.On the disruptor front, work on reducing your nighttime exposure to blue light(put your cell phone in your nightstand drawer!) and try to increase yoursunlight exposure up to an hour per day.Lastly, I’ll recommend that you start fasting intermittently. We will explorethis in detail later in this chapter.FOODS FOR EACH PHASE OF THE PLANT PARADOX PROGRAMHere is a handy, at-a-glance chart of the foods you should aim to eat in eachphase of the program. Remember: Whenever possible, try to select organic andnon-GMO varieties.Phase 1 * Leafy green vegetables—endive, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and watercress * Cruciferous vegetables—bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, arugula, and mustard greens * Artichokes * Asparagus * Celery * Fennel * Radishes * Fresh herbs like mint, parsley, basil, cilantro, and chives * Garlic, onions, and leeks * Kelp, seaweed, and nori * Wild-caught seafood or pastured poultry, no more than a total of eight ounces a day * Quorn products (see Chapter 4 [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#qp] for acceptable options) * Grain-free tempeh * Hemp tofu * Avocado, up to one a day * Olives * Olive oil, avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, walnut oil, hemp seed oil, flaxseed oil, MCT oil, perilla oil, ghee * Nuts, up to 1/2 cup per day (see “Yes, Please” food list [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#ah1-L4] for specific types) * Lemon juice * Vinegar * Mustard * Tea (any kind) * Coffee * Acceptable sweeteners (see Chapter 4 [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#swt] for a complete list)Phase 2All of the foods listed for Phase 1, plus: * Small amounts of in-season fruit or green bananas, mangoes, or papayas * Figs * Dates * So-Delicious No Added Sugar Coconut Ice Cream * Pastured or omega-3 eggs * Plantains * Shirataki noodles (sold under the brand name Miracle Noodles) * Cappello’s Fettuccine * Palmini Pasta (noodles made from hearts of palm) * Coconut-, cassava-, and almond-flour tortillas (try Siete and The Real Coconut brands) * Parsnips * Turnips * Jicama * Celery root * Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) * Yams and sweet potatoes * Almond flour * Cassava flour * Coconut flour * Sorghum * Millet * Inulin and yacón syrup * Okra * Radicchio * Mushrooms * Plain goat, sheep, or coconut yogurt * Limited amounts of casein A2 dairy, including milk, cheese, and yogurt from goats, sheep, water buffalo, and Southern European cowsPhase 3All the foods on the Phase 1 and Phase 2 lists, plus: * Peeled and seeded baby cucumbers, zucchini, and Japanese eggplant* * Peeled and seeded heirloom tomatoes and peppers* * Pressure-cooked organic beans and lentils or Eden brand canned beans or lentils* * Pressure-cooked Indian white basmati rice * If you have to have bread: True artisan white sourdough bread may be safe, but I doubt it. Use only as a sponge to get olive oil into your mouth. Do not eat if you have an autoimmune disease, celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, diabetes, prediabetes, memory loss, or cancer.*Gradually reintroduce small amounts of these, one food at a time, to determinehow they affect you.INTERMITTENT FASTINGAn important aspect of the Plant Paradox program is deliberately choosingperiods of time to refrain from eating. This is not about cutting calories; itis about giving your digestive system a chance to rest and your body a chance toheal and regenerate. We have evolved to benefit from these breaks from food;after all, fasting was simply a normal part of life for our ancestors.Intermittent fasting encourages our bodies to practice their innate ability tonot only withstand periods of deficiency, but to actually benefit from them.There are various ways to try intermittent fasting. Here are three strategies Irecommend—try them out and see what works for you. * Choose two days per week for very light eating. Consume only 500–600 calories a couple days a week. Preferably focus on nutrient-dense options like large salads, cruciferous veggies, or even a whole roasted cauliflower. (I dare you, try to eat a whole one by yourself!) Mondays and Thursdays work well for many of my patients. Mondays are the start of the week, a natural day of repentance after the excesses of the weekend. Thursdays are often manageable because you have the weekend to look forward to, but which days you choose doesn’t really matter. It is possible to lose about a pound a week doing this. * Extend your daily fast. Instead of our routine overnight fast (between last night’s dinner and the morning’s breakfast), wait a full sixteen hours between the last meal of the day and the first meal of the next day. For example, if you finish eating dinner at 7:00 p.m., wait until at least 11:00 a.m. the following day to enjoy your next meal. * Adopt a seasonal intermittent fasting schedule. This is my preferred way to fast. For example, from about January to May, eat only between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. each day during the week. Until 6:00 p.m., you can drink plenty of green tea and mint tea, and have a cup of coffee if you like. I’ve been doing this for twelve years. It’s not only possible, it’s sustainable!THE PLANT PARADOX COMMUNITYThe 30-day challenge is also meant to nurture and celebrate the community behindthe program, which longtime Plant Paradoxers consistently tell me has made ahuge difference in their ability to enjoy and stick with their new lifestyle.Our presence online and via social media offers newcomers and old-timers alike away to tap other participants for guidance about a particular food or recipe, toask a question about what’s allowed on the plan, or simply to connect withothers who share the same challenges and goals.One way to access this community is on Facebook and Instagram, where the 30-daychallenge hashtag (#PlantParadox30) is used. There are also a host of greatPlant Paradox–inspired bloggers and Instagrammers who began documenting the waysthis program has changed their lives, and sharing their journey and advice withothers. New sites appear almost daily. Here are a few of my favorites:@creativeinmykitchen and creativeinmykitchen.com@myx.inc and myx.com@lectinfree_rv@beinfinefettle and beinfinefettle.com@thelectinfreegirl@plant_paradox_lifestyle@lectinfreelife.laura@goodgutbugsMy website, drgundry.com, as well as my YouTube channel and Facebook page, areadditional sources of free content and useful information, including plenty ofrecipe demonstrations from yours truly!LIFE AFTER PLANT PARADOX 30After thirty days of the Plant Paradox Quick and Easy program, your body willhave changed considerably. It’s likely that your health issues—anything fromallergies to depression to IBS to Parkinson’s—will have improved considerablyand you will be a few pounds lighter. My guess is you’ll also have a lot moreenergy and be in a better mood. But this is just the beginning.If you are enjoying the results, you can and should continue on the program. Ifyou feel like you need additional concentrated healing and weight loss, go backto Phase 2 for a few weeks and get your body into its prime. Here are a fewsigns that it’s time to graduate to Phase 3: * Bowel movements have become regular * Joints have stopped aching * Brain fog has dissipated * Skin has cleared * Energy levels have improved * Weight has normalizedIf you feel great after the 30-day challenge and have achieved most of themilestones listed above, stay in Phase 3 and enjoy the process of slowlyreintroducing some lectin-containing foods to your diet. It’s best to test onlyone food per week so you can properly analyze how your body is tolerating it:Monitor your bowel movements, skin, joints, and mood, and you will be able totell if you can continue consuming it. You’ll notice that the reintroduced foodsin this phase often need a slightly different treatment to become acceptable anddigestible. Once you have fully settled into the diet, you will be able to focuson decreasing your exposure to the deadly disruptors, which will also make anoticeable impact on your well-being.Life after the Plant Paradox 30-day challenge can continue to foster amazingresults—just stick with the protocol. Phase 3 is the stage most of my clientsare in for life. It’s been said many times: The Plant Paradox isn’t a diet; it’sa lifestyle! My patients have raved about their improved health and well-being,and because of it, they’ve said that nothing could make them go back to theirold eating habits."},{"pageContent":"PART 2SETTING UP FOR SUCCESS [nav.xhtml#npa7]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4STOCK YOUR KITCHEN [nav.xhtml#nch8]You have arrived at what is, in many ways, the heart of this book.

Some of them may be new to you, but mostof them are likely familiar or may already be favorites (who doesn’t love almondbutter, avocados, or chocolate?). My simple advice: Give them all a try! Severalof these foods were once new to me, and now I can’t imagine my kitchen withoutthem. Also, be assured that many of the recipes in this book incorporateunfamiliar ingredients in familiar ways—for example you may not have triedMiracle Noodles before, but you’ve likely sampled a tasty casserole similar tomy Veggie Bake [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#vb]. The same goes for the vegetarianmeat substitute Quorn, which might be a new discovery—but throw a handful in myQuorn Taco Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts] and you’ll soon be a convert. Andbe sure not to overlook the almond, cassava, and coconut flours—it is worthseeking them out. They will make your run-of-the-mill baked goods healthy,lectin-free, and truly delicious. You will never bake with all-purpose flouragain!Lastly, when feasible and financially viable, I urge you to choose non-GMO andorganic varieties of these foods. I realize it’s not always possible, so just doyour best. Now, without further ado, here is the Plant Paradox Pantry: * Almond butter: Peanut butter, or even trendy cashew or sunflower butter, is a favorite of many people, including children, but given these nut butters’ tremendous lectin load, they are not at all compliant with the program. Luckily, almond butter is low in lectins and every bit as versatile and delicious. Ideally, you’d spring for the organic types made from raw nuts, but if not, just be sure what you buy is free of partially hydrogenated oils and sweeteners. * Almond flour: Made of finely ground, peeled almonds, almond flour is a great replacement for all-purpose flour in many baked goods. Look for skinless or blanched almonds in the ingredient list, as the skins do include lectins. Ideally look for nuts that are non-GMO and organic. Like all nuts and nut flours, keep them in the freezer for the longest shelf life. * Almond milk: You want non-GMO, organic almond milk preferably, with no sweetener or added flavors. It’s a delicious milk alternative that can also be used in smoothies and baked goods. * Arrowroot flour: Also known as “arrowroot starch,” this flour is made from the root of the arrowhead plant, an herb. It’s an excellent thickener for sauces (where you might have used cornstarch) or even alternative-flour waffle and pancake batter to help hold the batter together. * Avocado: Beautifully green, ripe avocados have 1,000 purposes in my kitchen. Try making Avocado Cloud Bread [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#acb]; add them to a smoothie for a creamy texture; or just eat them right out of their skin with some salt and olive oil. They are delicious and so healthful you can even eat one a day! To ripen an avocado quickly, put it near your green bananas, or even try baking it in a 350-degree oven for ten minutes to soften it up—the flavor won’t be perfect but the texture will. If you have a glut of avocados that are ripe and ready to eat, place them whole in the fridge for a day or two, or puree them and store in the freezer for use in smoothies. * Avocado mayonnaise: Mayonnaise made with avocado oil is your best bet, health-wise. Conventional mayonnaise is made with low-quality, high-lectin, GMO soybean, safflower, or canola oil and should definitely be avoided. Primal Kitchen makes a great avocado mayo that’s available through Thrive Market; Chosen Foods avocado mayo is available at Costco. * Avocado oil: Avocado oil, with its mild flavor, is an excellent all-purpose oil that you can find at Costco and most supermarkets. It’s high smoke point makes it great for cooking, but you can use it in dressings and marinades as well. * Baking powder, aluminum-free: You do not want to consume aluminum, so be sure to search out one of two aluminum-free brands: Bob’s Red Mill and Rumford. While you’re at it, please replace your aluminum foil with parchment paper! * Basmati rice from India: You can reintroduce very moderate amounts of rice to your diet in Phase 3, but only white basmati rice from India, because it has the lowest lectin content and the highest levels of resistant starch of any rice. We want to eat foods that humans have been eating for a long time, and Indian basmati rice has been in the food supply much longer than rice from the United States. (Texas basmati, for example, is actually an entirely different grain, with less resistant starch.) To increase the resistant starch content of rice, or anything else for that matter, cool it in the refrigerator after cooking and then reheat it before serving. Presto! More resistant starch. Your gut buddies will thank you! * Cassava flour: Cassava flour comes from the root known as manioc, yucca, or yuca, and is full of beneficial resistant starch. Use it to make fluffy gluten-free baked goods. Moon Rabbit and Otto’s Naturals brands are good, available on Amazon, and increasingly found in grocery stores. * Cauliflower rice: Cauliflower rice isn’t actually rice at all; it’s finely chopped cauliflower. Make it yourself by pulsing cauliflower florets in a food processor, or buy it fresh or ready-to-use in the freezer section of Whole Foods, Costco, Trader Joe’s, and other grocery stores. Cauliflower rice is a staple component of many Plant Paradox recipes. * Cayenne pepper: Made of ground peppers after they have been peeled and seeded, cayenne, and its milder sister paprika, is a godsend if you love spicy food. Many other chili products, like red chili flakes, include the lectin-rich seeds and skins and should be avoided. But sprinkle on cayenne with abandon! Try a little on a halved avocado with salt. * Chocolate: Dark chocolate, ideally organic and fair trade, is full of polyphenols, flavonoids, and fiber, all of which have anti-inflammatory properties. One ounce or less a day is fine in Phases 2 and 3. For snacking, look for a bar at least 72 percent cacao; for baking, do the same but try to find it unsweetened as well. World Market’s 99 percent cacao chocolate has a surprisingly sweet taste, while Trader Joe’s has a 100 percent chocolate bar with cacao nibs called Montezuma (and there is no revenge); Dagoba and Lily’s sell excellent chocolate chips. * Cocoa powder, nonalkalized: Cocoa powder is simply ground cacao beans. (Beware of hot cocoa mix, which includes lots of sugar.) Because it is naturally a bit bitter due to the beneficial polyphenols, many cocoa powders contain potassium bromate or potassium carbonate, which neutralize both the taste and the health benefits. So be sure to skip the Dutch-processed cocoa powder and look for the words “nonalkalized.” Dagoba or Scharffen Berger brands are my favorites. * Coconut aminos: This salty, savory condiment can be used instead of soy sauce and tamari. Soy sauce and tamari are made from soy, which is extremely high in lectins, and soy sauce also contains wheat, another lectin offender. Coconut aminos are great in sauces, stir fries, or just drizzled on plain cooked vegetables. * Coconut cream: The richest, creamiest part of coconut milk, coconut cream is now sold as its own product. Look for BPA-free cans that include no added sugar; Trader Joe’s has a good one. In a pinch, you can buy a can of coconut milk and refrigerate it overnight; the next day, carefully scoop out the cream, which will have risen to the top of the can and hardened. * Coconut flour: Coconut flour is a wonderful all-purpose flour alternative, and can be used in a wide variety of baked goods, from pancakes to muffins. Its texture and absorbing abilities are a bit different from that of regular flour, so do follow recipes before experimenting. Bob’s Red Mill, Nutiva, and Let’s Do are some of my favorite brands. * Coconut milk: This versatile pantry staple can be used as an especially creamy milk alternative or as an ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. It’s sold both in the refrigerated dairy case and in the beverage aisle in a convenient shelf-stable Tetra Pak or in BPA-free cans. Be sure to purchase only unsweetened and unflavored versions. * Coconut oil: Excellent for both high-heat cooking, because of its high smoke point, and baking, due to its slightly sweet flavor, coconut oil is a wonderful Phase 3 ingredient. Be sure to buy organic, extra virgin coconut oil from brands such as Kirkland, Viva Labs, Carrington Farms, and Nature’s Way. * Eggs: Omega-3 or pastured eggs are a convenient and delicious source of protein. I suggest sticking mostly to the yolks, which are a great source of healthy fats and nutrients. My favorite omelet is made from four yolks and one egg white. (Your pet will love the extra whites.) Egg substitutes are tricky, as some contain soy. Bob’s Red Mill egg substitute is now the safest egg-alternative product; other options include Namaste Raw Foods Egg Replacer, or Orgran Vegan Easy Egg. For use in baked goods, feel free to replace regular eggs with a flaxseed “egg”: for every egg needed, mix together 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed and 3 tablespoons water, stir, let rest 5 minutes, then incorporate per directions. * Erythritol: This natural sweetener is a sugar alcohol. It won’t cause a spike in blood sugar because your body processes it differently from traditional sugars. (It also won’t cause an upset stomach, like some other alternatives.) Best of all, it’s delicious and dissolves easily into batters and baked goods. Swerve and Wholesome are brands to look for. * Flaxseed meal: Whole flaxseeds are a great source of short-chain omega-3s and they contain no lectins. They do, however, need to be ground into meal in order for your body to be able to access those valuable omega-3s, and once they are ground, they are very prone to spoilage. Buying them whole and grinding them as needed in a coffee or spice grinder is one good option. Or you can buy them already ground and store them in the freezer to keep them fresh. Be sure to choose a brand that was cold-milled; heat can oxidize the fats. * Ghee: Ghee is clarified butter, meaning the milk solids (which consist of protein, including the troublesome casein A1) have been cooked out of it, making it shelf stable and easily digestible, as well as significantly more gut-friendly than butter. For the highest amounts of omega-3s, buy ghee made from the milk of grass-fed cows. (Conventionally-raised cows, fed a diet of corn and soy, have fewer omega-3s in their milk.) Pure and Pure Indian Foods are two favorite grass-fed brands. * Goat’s milk, cheese, and yogurt: Unlike most cow’s milk, goat’s milk doesn’t contain the protein casein A1, so it is fine on the Plant Paradox program. Luckily, goat cheese, sometimes known as chèvre, and goat’s milk yogurt or unsweetened, unflavored goat’s milk kefir are all up for grabs too. * Hemp milk: This is an alternative milk made from the hemp plant, which is kin to marijuana, but please note that eating or drinking it will not give you a high. Use as you would any alternative milk. Be sure to buy only the unsweetened, unflavored varieties. * Hemp protein powder: If you are vegan or want to limit your animal protein, try hemp protein powder as a wonderful alternative to whey protein powder. Excellent in smoothies or baked goods, it provides all the essential amino acids and plenty of omega-3s. * Hemp tofu: Conventional tofu is made from lectin-rich soybeans and is therefore noncompliant with the Plant Paradox program, but densely textured hemp tofu provides a super-nutritious alternative. Look for the Living Harvest Tempt brand, which is non-GMO, at Whole Foods. * Honey: Natural or not, honey is still a sugar, and should be consumed in only very small amounts—one teaspoon or less a day—and only in Phase 3 of the Plant Paradox program. Stevia or erythritol (e.g., Swerve) are preferable sweetener options, but if they just won’t do, raw local honey or manuka honey are good choices. (Manuka honey comes from bees that feed on the flowers of the manuka tree, which is native to New Zealand and Australia.) There are some honey-specific enzymes that provide health benefits. * Inulin: Inulin is a sugar replacement made from chicory root or agave. You can use it as you would sugar in regular cooking and in baking. Your gut buddies will love the oligopolysaccharides that it provides. Sold under the brand names Just Like Sugar or Viv Agave, it’s available at Whole Foods, many grocery stores, and online. * Millet: You’re probably familiar with millet because it is a popular component of birdseed. But it is not just for the birds! This hull-less (and thus, lectin-free) grain is a tasty addition to your diet, and can be used much like bulgur or quinoa. * Miracle rice: Besides limited amounts of Indian basmati rice and cauliflower rice, you can find another way to satisfy your cravings in Miracle Rice, made from konjac root, which is lectin-free. Look for Miracle Rice in the refrigerated section, near the tofu. * Mozzarella: True mozzarella is made from the milk of water buffalo, meaning it doesn’t contain casein A1, so you can eat it in limited amounts in Phase 3. Read the label carefully; you want to be sure to buy “buffalo mozzarella,” or “bufalo” made from buffalo’s milk. Most supermarket mozzarella, especially the shredded kind, is made with cow’s milk and should be avoided. Look around for goat’s milk mozzarella too. * Nori: You’re probably most accustomed to seeing nori wrapped around sushi rolls. Nori is a type of seaweed that comes in dried square sheets about the size of your outstretched hand. They are a great substitute for flour and corn tortillas when making wraps. Also try filling them with scrambled eggs, tuna or salmon salad, or your favorite sandwich fixings. Choose organic nori when possible. * Nutritional yeast: Nutritional yeast has long been a culinary secret for vegans. The savory, cheesy flavor of this vitamin-B–rich powder (not the same thing as what makes bread rise) can add an umami-filled umph to just about anything—it can be used in sauces, added to steamed or roasted vegetables, sprinkled on eggs, and more. Look for it in natural food stores or online. * Olive oil, extra virgin: Extra virgin olive oil has a thousand uses—from dressings to cooking to sautéing—and once you’re in Phase 2, you can have plenty of it daily. The best extra virgin olive oils come in opaque bottles to protect them from light damage. Either way, the oil itself should have a greenish tint and a fresh, grassy smell. Organic is best. I prefer European olive oils, especially from Italy (you can find them at Costco, for example), but some good American brands are O and California Olive Ranch. If you are able, try a few before you buy to find one you really like. And if it makes you cough when you taste it, that’s a good thing. It’s a sign the oil is high in polyphenols, which are plant-based compounds packed with antioxidants that can help protect against cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. * Paprika: Like cayenne pepper, paprika is a spice made from peppers that have been deseeded and skinned, so it is low in lectins. It comes in hot, sweet, and smoked varieties, making it a versatile and valuable cooking ingredient. Experiment with it—its rich flavor will add a lot of dimension to sauces, spreads, soups, and marinades. * Parmigiano-Reggiano: Authentic Parmesan cheese is made from the milk of Italian cows, which has been acquired only during the spring and fall, when they graze on grass. This means the cows are grass-fed, so there is no worry about corn or soy feed affecting their milk. Another bonus is that since they are located in the Southern Mediterranean, there is no casein A1 in their milk. While buying the real thing is expensive, realize that a small wedge will last you a while—just a little sprinkle adds a lot of flavor to any dish. Plus you can use the rinds of the cheese too: Make a broth out of them, add to soups or stews, or add them to braised or simmered dishes. You can also throw one into the Spinach Cauliflower Risotto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#scr], for extra flavor. * Pecorino Romano: This sheep’s milk cheese is from Tuscany. Like Parmigiano-Reggiano, it’s a strong, salty, grating cheese. Try shaving onto pizzas, shredding into risottos, or sprinkling onto finished vegetable soups. * Perilla oil: Made from the seeds of the perilla plant, this oil is commonly used in Asian cuisine and can be used interchangeably with olive or coconut oil for home cooking. As a bonus, it is a great source of the omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid and brain-boosting rosmarinic acid. Look for it at Asian markets, natural food stores, Whole Foods, or online. * Quorn products: This meat substitute is similar in taste and texture to chicken, but is made of mushroom “roots.” Beware that not all Quorn products are Plant Paradox–friendly. Stick to the tenders, cutlets, and ground versions only (which, unfortunately, are not vegan due to the inclusion of egg-white protein). The vegan selections and breaded options are not compliant with the Plant Paradox program because they contain both potato and gluten. Look for Quorn products in the vegetarian freezer section of most supermarkets. * Sea salt, iodized: As opposed to table salt, sea salt contains many trace minerals and is therefore a more healthful option. But be sure to buy the iodized version, as iodine is essential for healthy thyroid function. Typically, sea salt isn’t iodized, and when food trends encouraged people to switch from regular iodized salt to fancier non-iodized salts, iodine deficiencies became much more prevalent. Luckily, iodized sea salt is now available; Morton’s has a good one, as does Hain. * Sorghum: There are only two grains in the world that are lectin-free: millet and sorghum. Luckily, sorghum is very versatile, so you can eat it all sorts of ways without getting tired of it: as a breakfast porridge, as a side dish, or even popped, like popcorn (use the stove top method or an air-popper, as long as the air holes are smaller than the sorghum itself). Look for Bob’s Red Mill sorghum or “popped” versions like Mini Pops, Nature Nate’s, Healthy Tasty Sustainable Gourmet, and Pop I.Q. * Stevia: Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the stevia plant. It contains no calories and is 300 times sweeter than sugar. It does not cause a spike in blood sugar. Useful for cooking and baking, stevia comes in both a powdered form or in liquid drops, but remember how very strong it is when experimenting. I prefer the SweetLeaf brand for two reasons: It contains no fillers (many other brands include maltodextrin), and the first ingredient is inulin, which your gut buddies love to feast on. * Tempeh: Tempeh is a fermented soy product—and because it is fermented, the soy is safe to consume. Tempeh is a great blank canvas to pick up the flavors of whatever it is cooked with. An excellent source of protein, it is the perfect addition to stir fries with the vegetables of your choice or for topping a Taco Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts] or risotto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#scr]. Per usual, make an effort to buy the organic, non-GMO versions, and be sure to check the ingredient list to confirm the tempeh is not mixed with grains (as some brands are wont to do). * Vanilla extract: To avoid a ton of chemicals, and to have much better flavor, buy only vanilla extract that contains the word “pure” on its label. A drop of this and a little stevia will transform your plain goat, sheep, hemp, or coconut yogurt into something extra delicious, more like the flavored premixed cow’s milk yogurts from the store. * Yogurt: Plain goat, sheep, hemp, or coconut milk yogurt is a satisfying and convenient snack, breakfast, or creamy topping to all sorts of dishes, sweet or savory. Be sure to choose only plain versions of these many options; flavored yogurt is loaded with added sugars and often-artificial stabilizers and flavorings.PANTRY AND FRIDGE PITFALLSNow that we’ve covered the healthy, gut-loving foods that are best to stock inyour kitchen, it might be helpful to look at a few of the items I get the mostquestions about. These are the bites, sips, and toppings that can be easy tooverlook—but many of the food products we use habitually can derail progress onthe Plant Paradox plan. It’s worth taking a moment to do a full assessment ofyour fridge and pantry to eliminate these food and drinks. * Alcohol (with exceptions): Only red wine, champagne, brown liquor (alcohol aged in wood absorbs the polyphenols in the wood), and gin (juniper berries are loaded with polyphenols) are Plant Paradox approved, in limited quantities. On the plus side, I’m sure your neighbors will be thrilled if you clear out your fridge and liquor cabinet of beer and vodka! * Artificially sweetened foods: As discussed in Chapter 1 [Chapter_1_Whats_a_Lectin.xhtml#swt], artificial sweeteners are very bad for your gut, both destroying friendly bacteria as well as causing your brain to seek more sweets and store fat. When your good gut bacteria are diminished, your body is even less prepared to handle the lectins it has ingested, and more damage can occur. Beware of the widespread prevalence of artificial sweeteners, as they appear in all sorts of foods and drinks. Be sure to read labels on any and all packaged food, especially health and protein bars. Or even better, stick to organic, non-GMO whole foods! Ingredients to avoid include saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame, and neotame. * Condiments: Many condiments—including chutneys, pickles, relishes, hot sauces, ketchups, jams, bean pastes, and so on—are made with sugar and often include a glut of chemical preservatives and additives, including gluten (in addition to often being made with soy, fruit, tomatoes, or other lectin-rich ingredients). If you clear these out of your kitchen, you’ll have more room for the many gut-friendly accoutrements, like avocado-oil mayo, mustard, coconut aminos, vinegars, and nutritional yeast. * Green beans, sugar snap peas, edamame, and peas: These vegetables may be tricky to remember as being not Plant Paradox compliant, as they are quite different from the nightshades most often associated with the “No, Thank You” list. But these particular plants are lectin-rich and should be avoided, no matter the phase you are in or what cooking processes you subject them to. * Oils like soy, grape seed, corn, peanut, cottonseed, safflower, sunflower, partially hydrogenated, vegetable, and canola: It’s easy to mistake one of these oils as healthly when you are distracted, but they are anything but. Stock your kitchen with only delicious, versatile olive oil, avocado, sesame, perilla, or any other approved oils (see complete list [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#ao]) and read labels of packaged foods. * Peanut butter: There are many scientific claims that peanut butter is the “perfect food.” But I have to strongly disagree. Even if you were to stick with the natural variety, which has no added sugars or stabilizers, the peanut factor alone makes this product one of the highest-lectin-containing foods in existence. Added is the fact that we often spread it on bread with jams laden with sugar or artificial sweetener, making the whole package a lectin and sugar bomb. I’d argue that even people not following the Plant Paradox should avoid peanut butter. An easy swap is almond butter, preferably from raw and organic peeled almonds, with no added sweeteners or oils. * Seeds like pumpkin and sunflower: You know by now to avoid the seeds and peels of vegetables, but you may be confused because there are a few seeds and seed products that are fine on the Plant Paradox program (i.e., flax, sesame, poppy, and hemp seeds; sesame oil; tahini). Pumpkin and sunflower seeds, however, fall squarely into the “No, Thank You” camp, as they contain lectins. * Whole-wheat, whole-grain anything: Due to the prevalence of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), as well as other lectins like gluten, food made of whole wheat is not going to work for anyone on the Plant Paradox program, even in a later phase, even if pressure-cooked. The good news? White flour is often considered much tastier, and you are allowed a small portion of white flour–based products in Phase 3. Organic, artisanal, gut-friendly sourdough bread is fermented, which helps further reduce lectin counts, so it is an especially good option. Whole grains are similarly problematic because the germ and endosperm (which, when intact, is what makes the grain whole) contain the most lectin.FOOD SHOPPING TIPS AND TRICKSWHERE TO SOURCE YOUR FOODShopping at the supermarket can be a bit overwhelming once you realize how manyreal pitfalls there are. So many foods marketed as “healthy” are just plain notgood for you. Not to mention the ever-confusing terminology found on food labelsand packaging. But it’s still essential to read those labels. Being choosy makesa huge difference in the quality of nutrition you consume and it also keeps yourlectin and preservative load as low as possible.Another tip for successful shopping for the Plant Paradox plan is to use all theresources you have available to you. Your neighborhood supermarket will bevital, of course. I’ve tried to use ingredients in my recipes that are availablein nationwide stores, to keep the program as easy and affordable as possible.But if you are unable to find what you need at your local spot, there are someadditional resources to explore: * Amazon: You can find almost any shelf-stable food on Amazon these days, including foods tailored for specific dietary needs. * Bob’s Red Mill: A great source for millet, sorghum, and specialty flours. I also recommend their vegan egg substitute. * Butcher shop: It will be much easier to source 100 percent grass-fed and -finished meat if you are able to talk to a butcher and ask questions. It is also easier to find pastured poultry and grass-fed and -finished beef at a butcher. * Costco: A super affordable option, Costco is a great place to stock up on staples like nuts, vitamins, and oils in bulk. * Farmers markets: When you are shopping for organic and non-GMO vegetables, a farmers market can be very helpful. Once you know your local farmers’ designations and practices, you can confidently buy anything being sold as long as it’s on the “Yes, Please” list. And if you have questions, the farmer is often right there to help you! * Fish market: Like going to your butcher, your local fishmonger can give you insight into the source of your seafood. But don’t despair if that’s not available to you. Costco, Trader Joe’s, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts, and a host of other regional grocery stores have an increasing variety of wild-caught fish and shellfish, both fresh and frozen. Avoiding farm-raised fish is important, and you can ask for help distinguishing which fish is wild by talking to the store employees. * Supplements: Good supplements can be found at Costco, Trader Joe's, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, and Amazon. I have also combined many of my favorite nutrients together in formulas for GundryMD.com. * Thrive: A membership-based website that offers high-quality, organic foods and products geared to specific nutritional needs (e.g., vegan, paleo, keto, etc.) at low prices. Think of it like a health-focused, online Costco. * Trader Joe’s: A store focused on specialty and health-oriented options, Trader Joe’s is a great place to pick up pantry staples like coconut cream as well as natural cleaning products. Plus they have a great cheese selection, but again use only the approved choices.DECIPHERING LABELS ON POULTRY, EGGS, MEAT, AND SEAFOODProduct labels are meant to offer transparency into the origin of an item, butunfortunately the labeling on eggs, poultry, meat, and seafood has gotten moreconvoluted as concerns about animal welfare and livestock feed and drugs haveincreased. This list will help you choose the animal products that best serveyour needs for nutrition. If you see the words “farm-raised” or “organic” onfish or shellfish, these fish have been bred in floating pens where they are fedgrains or soy as well as antibiotics. Similarly, even though it sounds pristine,Scottish, Norwegian, or Canadian salmon are all farmed. * Organic: Buyer beware when looking at the “organic” label applied to eggs, chicken, and even beef or buffalo meats. As you now know, we all are what we eat, so when we eat animals that have consumed lectin-rich grains and soy, even if organic, we consume those lectins too. For seafood, “organic” means that the fish are not wild, and have been raised in pens and fed a diet of grains or soy (and antibiotics). * All vegetarian-fed: This is a designation most often found on poultry, and likely means that these chickens were fed grains, pseudo-grains, and/or soy instead of animal by-products. Unfortunately, this vegetarian feed, in addition to not being a natural diet for poultry (who would eat insects if given the choice), is loaded with lectins, GMOs, and Roundup (i.e., glyphosate). * Free-range: While this label (most often used for chickens) officially means that the animals are given access to the outside for at least five minutes a day, the reality is that the birds still live in a crowded barn for most of the other 23 hours and 55 minutes each day. In most cases, the barn is so overcrowded—up to 100,000 chickens in a confined space—that they are never able to make it out, and if they do, it could be only to visit a small, muddy, fenced-in or netted-in yard. * Cage-free: While this designation might make you imagine chickens freely roaming about outside, eating grubs, the reality is they are still confined to an overcrowded barn. By definition, “cage-free” only implies a lack of cage, and means that these chickens never have access to the outside. * Pasture-raised: By far the best option for poultry, “pasture-raised” birds are kept outside year-round, with safe and accessible housing to protect them from predators and extreme weather. Even better, each bird must be provided with 108 square feet, an area capped at approximately 1,000 birds for every 2.5 acres. Pasture-raised is the gold standard, and you can taste the difference in the meat and eggs. Sadly, however, it is rare to find even a pastured bird whose diet hasn’t been supplemented with some form of grain. Look for “corn- and soy-free” or coconut feed diets. If you can’t find that, look for Mary’s Free-Range Pasture Raised Air Chilled Chicken. It’s not lectin-free, but is a good option in a pinch and is usually available at Whole Foods and other similar stores. * Omega-3: This is a designation only for eggs, which means that the hens who laid them consumed a natural diet enhanced with flaxseed and/or algae, which contain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. Though these chickens haven’t been able to forage and consume their natural diet of insects, omega-3 eggs, with their increased nutritional benefits, are often your best choice if you can’t find eggs from pasture-raised chickens. * Hormone-free: This simply means that the animals in question, whether raised for meat or eggs, were not administered any hormones. It implies nothing about diet (which can include animal by-products, GMO or nonorganic grains) or whether they received antibiotics. * Antibiotic-free: Like the “hormone-free” designation, “antibiotic-free” means only that the animals didn’t receive antibiotic injections or have antibiotics added to their feed. It means nothing in regard to diet or hormones. Be especially careful because, to save a flock, laws allow the use of antibiotics with a veterinarian’s permission. (The veterinarian often happens to work for a giant poultry corporation.) * Grass-fed: This designation means only that the animals (often cows being raised for beef) were given access to grass at some point in their lives. This could mean merely having access to hay and grass for a little while, before being fattened up for slaughter on a diet of grains, antibiotics, and growth hormones. Therefore, the ideal term to find is “grass-fed and grass-finished” or “100 percent grass-fed,” because these designations mean the animals ate their natural diet for their entire lives.CLEARING OUT ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORSAfter you’ve gone to the trouble of overhauling your pantry and fridge, it’stime to clean out the household products that may contain endocrine disruptors.These chemicals are found everywhere—from food to plastics to personal hygieneproducts. Here’s a list of compounds to watch out for, as well as where they aremost often found, and the best replacements. Knowledge is power, and a few smalladjustments can prevent a lot of toxin exposure. * BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene): Not only is this chemical found in many foods (think anything with “whole grain” in its name, as well as crackers, bread, and cookies) as a stabilizing agent, but it’s also found in their wrappers. Manufacturers do not have to include BHT in the ingredient list, whether it’s in the food or the wrapper, so your best bet is to make homemade goodies and keep them in glass or metal containers. * Teflon (also known as polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] and perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA]): These chemicals are famously found in nonstick cookware, which I recommend avoiding completely. Use ceramic coated or stainless steel pans instead. It also appears in stain-resistant fabrics and carpeting. * BPA (bisphenol A): This is found in plastic bottles, the linings of cans, and even in baby’s teething rings. Use a reusable stainless steel or glass water bottle instead, and choose cans that state they are “BPA-free.” Wooden or rubber teethers are much safer and just as satisfying for babies. BPA’s “safe” replacement, BPS, appears not to be safer at all. Beware also of store receipts printed with thermal paper, which contains BPA—ask instead for an emailed receipt, or if you must keep the information on a paper one, photograph it with your phone, throw it away, and wash your hands. * Phthalates (including dicyclohexyl phthalate [DCHP], di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate [DEHP], di-n-octyl phthalate [DnOP], and bisphenol S [BPS]): These synthetic compounds are found everywhere—plastic wrap, plastic bags, plastic containers (including the trays used to package supermarket meats and fish), dishwashing gloves, children’s toys, to name a few. They also act as solvents in many perfumed cosmetic and household items like lubricant, hairspray, insect repellent, and much more. Check labels of these products carefully; non-perfumed or scented options may eliminate the phthalates. Instead of plastic food containers, use wax paper or cloth food bags (check Etsy), or glass or stainless steel containers. Use natural dish soap and skip the gloves. Choose wooden toys for your child. * Parabens, such as methylparaben: Many cosmetics, deodorants/antiperspirants, and sunscreens include parabens. In short, avoid all sunscreens unless the active ingredient is titanium oxide or zinc. Avoid scented products across the board. And check the Environmental Working Group’s website for a list of safe cosmetics and deodorants: www.ewg.org/skindeep/. * Triclosan and triclocarban: These chemicals are found in hand sanitizers and all antibacterial soaps, as well as many toothpastes. These are easy to avoid. To clean your hands, just use regular soap and hot water, and to clean your teeth, try Trader Joe’s all-natural, no-fluoride Antiplaque Toothpaste, The Dirt’s Coconut Oil Toothpaste, or Tom’s of Maine products, for example.KITCHEN EQUIPMENTThere are a few tricks to making the Plant Paradox plan quick and easy, and manyof them reside with the equipment you use to prep and cook your food. Having theright tools will make a huge difference in your cooking efforts. I know fromexperience that a few saved minutes go a long way whether it’s in the morningwhen you’re rushing out the door, or when you’re hungry and tired after work.Investing in the right equipment is well worth the cabinet space and expense.I’ve kept this list to the bare necessities, so you know each piece will beuseful and impactful. * Blender: Between making smoothies, soups, dressings, and sauces, it’s not unusual for me to use my blender at least once a day. Some of my favorite high-speed, full-size options that are great for large batches and family cooking are from Blendtec, Vitamix, or Ninja. Good smaller options, best for cooking for only one or two, include the Magic Bullet or the NutriBullet. * Food processor: A food processor is truly a prep machine. You can save an impressive amount of time by chopping, slicing, and shredding in a processor compared with doing it by hand. Sometimes I’ll use my food processor to prep a ton of vegetables and dressings all at once over the weekend so they’re ready to go for salads and sides all week long. In fact, a food processor is worth acquiring just to use for cauliflower rice. Having a container of it pre-chopped in the fridge means I’m only minutes away from risotto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#scr]. * Knives: A good chef’s knife and paring knife make prepping foods a dream; just be sure to keep them well-sharpened for both ease and safety. A small, serrated knife can be handy as well, for example, in lieu of a serrated peeler, for removing the skins of tomatoes. * Microwave: This can be a useful appliance for getting meals on the table in minutes, but if you don’t already have one, do not feel the need to acquire one. * Mixing bowls: For mixing up a quick muffin batter, whipping up egg whites, or mashing avocados for guacamole, the right mixing bowl can make a big difference. I recommend buying a set that includes three or four different sizes (small, medium, and large). I like ones with high sides for easy mixing and less mess. Ceramic or glass work well, especially when whisking or beating. * Pressure cooker: In Phase 3 of the Plant Paradox plan, you can reintroduce some lectin-containing foods into your diet. The way we make many of these foods more gut friendly is by pressure-cooking them. Pressure-cooking makes it possible to eat beans, lentils, rice, or even tomato sauce, and is very quick and easy! My favorite brand of pressure cooker is the Instant Pot, which automatically regulates the pressure, making it easy and safe to use with little to no supervision. You might remember the pressure cookers of our grandmothers’ generation had an occasional habit of exploding and spraying hot food all over the kitchen. With this new technology there is no fear of that hazard now (though do take care not to overfill). The Instant Pot and other brands of multicookers also have the functionality to slow-cook, sauté, steam, and more. This saves time and also dishes. Pressure cookers cost around $100, but they often go on sale—check Target, Costco, and Amazon’s Black Friday deals. The expense is outweighed by its multiple benefits. * Salad spinner: Greens are a hugely important part of any healthy diet, but they are especially important for people on the Plant Paradox program. A salad spinner—which I admit does take up some room in a cupboard—will make prepping lettuces, chard, kale, mustard greens and all the rest a breeze. You can wash them in the bowl, drain them, and then spin the water away. Afterward, for easy storage, I like to roll the greens in a clean dish towel and store them in the crisper. The end result is fresh, dry greens that hold dressing well and can wait in the fridge for when you are ready to serve them. You will never need to buy a prewashed bag of salad again, which means no more plastic bags and no questionable added chemicals that keep your salad “fresh” for days on end. * Skillets: You will need some good pans. My definition of “good” does not include the nonstick variety because those are made from endocrine-disrupting chemicals that eventually get released into your food. I also don’t endorse cast-iron skillets—I’ve had patients who use them only once a week and have dangerously high iron levels. I recommend investing in a couple of high-quality stainless steel or ceramic-coated pans. They will make your food taste better—due to improved browning and searing, for example—and will last a lifetime. * Spiralizer: Since the Plant Paradox program does not include pasta in its diet recommendations, a spiralizer will come in very handy for any cravings you may have for noodles. With a quick flick of the wrist, it carves hard vegetables—such as jicama, sweet potatoes, and daikon radish, to name just a few—into thin long strands, effectively making gut-friendly noodles, ready to be eaten raw or quickly cooked in a sauce or soup. No need to buy a fancy, electronic one either. The manual version works very well and costs only about $15. * Vegetable peelers: As lectins are often found in the peels and seeds of plants, owning a hardworking peeler helps you lighten your lectin load. For example, in Phase 3 of the Plant Paradox program, limited amounts of tomatoes and cucumbers are allowed, but they must be peeled and seeded. I suggest purchasing both a straight-blade version and a serrated-blade version. Using the serrated one for delicate foods, like tomatoes, means you can skip the time-consuming step of blanching prior to peeling by hand.You may already own many of these items. If you don’t, I would consider buyingan additional piece or two. The upfront cost is offset in the long term by themoney you save cooking healthy meals at home instead of relying on conveniencefoods, ordering in, or going out. (In fact, the majority of my patients reportthey actually save money on the program!) Plus the time-saving benefits of thesetools will help make food prep quick and easy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5QUICK AND EASY STRATEGIES [nav.xhtml#nch9]It’s been very gratifying to hear from so many patients and readers of my booksas to how much the Plant Paradox has helped them. Even I have been amazed by theresults and the far-reaching changes the program has inspired.But another thing I hear is that some folks who are excited to start the programfind it challenging to fully commit to the lifestyle shift it requires. Betweendemanding work schedules, caring for children, making time for exercise,commuting, and the stress of the daily grind, they barely have time to eatlunch, let alone carefully pack a Plant Paradox–approved meal in advance.I get it; I really do. I see patients in my two clinics seven days a week andstruggle to fit all of my plans and obligations into my schedule. If you arealready short on time, adding a new food protocol on top of everything else canseem an impossible goal. This is exactly why I created the 30-day program, whichgives you all the tools you need to make the Plant Paradox truly quick andeasy—no matter what your current lifestyle.In this chapter we’ll look at some of the practical concerns of starting theprogram: how to get ready, plan ahead, and save time in the kitchen. I’ve alsoincluded some lists of snack ideas and last-minute throw-together meals forthose days when the best-laid plans go out the window. Lastly, I’ve included afew sample menus and ideas for entertaining and celebrating while on the PlantParadox. Just because you are working on improving your health doesn’t mean youcan’t have fun! My hope is that these strategies make it easier for you, dearreader, to enjoy the program and reap its rewards.STOCKING YOUR PLANT PARADOX PANTRYYou really can judge a cook by the state of their pantry: how well stocked itis, what it includes, and what it omits. A carefully planned pantry is the truesecret to making meals quick and easy—with the ingredients you have on hand, youcan often pull together meals without having to make a trip to the grocerystore. Like with any change, making a straight path to success offers a higherprobability that you will be able to follow through on your plans. Here are afew of the ways you can set yourself up for success: * Shop proactively: Taking the initiative to stock your pantry before you actually need certain ingredients is even more advantageous on the Plant Paradox program than it might be otherwise, because not all of your favorite items will be available at every store. At least 90 percent of the most commonly used Plant Paradox ingredients are available at big-box retailers like Costco and Walmart, but some items will require a trip to a specialty store or an Internet order. Making a trip over the weekend or spending a little time online to stock up on items you know will come in handy in a pinch means you will be better prepared to make delicious, satisfying meals for you and your family every day. (I include Miracle Noodles and approved sweeteners among the items I always like to have on hand.) * Simplify your grocery list: You don’t have to sit down and write a whole new list each week. Instead, keep a grocery list template in your notes on your phone with the essentials you use consistently. For example, you will always need leafy greens (my favorites are romaine, parsley, and spinach) and a few cruciferous veggies (like cauliflower, arugula, or broccoli). Having a dozen pastured or omega-3 eggs is a no-brainer. In the freezer section, frozen wild shrimp and a couple of Quorn products are non-perishable proteins you can use for countless meals throughout the week. * Be realistic: It can be tempting to imagine that you will be cooking all your meals from scratch every day, but in reality we all know that life often has other plans. Be kind to yourself—after all, you are making a big change to improve your health and well-being—and give yourself some premeditated support. Know that preparing for those times with some premade items might mean you make better, more consistent choices overall. For example, although I don’t recommend buying prewashed greens, if that is the easiest way to make sure you are stocked up and ready to have salads and sautés the first couple of weeks, I am all for it. Frozen cauliflower rice is an easy convenience that saves you the step of chopping it yourself. A block of organic frozen spinach is very convenient in a pinch for a quick soup or stew. Lastly, buying a few Plant Paradox–approved energy bars (see Chapter 4 [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#bars]) to keep on hand can often mean the difference between a desperate gas-station snack—full of sugars and GMOs and wrapped in a disruptor-filled food wrapper—and a perfectly acceptable convenience food that supplies your body with what it needs. A shortcut here and there can actually keep you on track, and that is very worthwhile. * Treat yourself: Stocking up on a bunch of new pantry items and staples can be expensive, and I understand that you might want to keep your purchases to a minimum. But I encourage you to make an effort to buy a few ingredients beyond the usual that you are especially excited about eating. Having some treats on hand that make this change easier and more delicious for you is well worth it in the long run. Rich and creamy almond butter and tahini feel naughty in the best way, and can go sweet or savory—try spreading some on a grain-free tortilla and sprinkling with some cinnamon for a delicious snack. And always have a generous supply of walnuts, pistachios, and other approved nuts on hand. (But, eat just a handful please!) Likewise, splurging on a few new condiments to spice up your everyday stir-fry or roasted vegetables (like coconut aminos or fish sauce) will make it feel like you are whipping up something special with those gut-loving greens rather than merely fueling your body.COOKING HACKSWhen you first look at the menus for the 30-day plan, it can seem like a lot ofcooking and prep work. And I can’t lie; it is certainly more involved thanpicking up precooked entrées at the supermarket deli or calling out for a pizza!But there are many strategies that can make the process more streamlined andmore efficient. Hack your way to quicker and easier mind and body health with afew of these approaches. * Food processing to the max: When you’re planning to use the food processor, take advantage of its multiple purposes and use it for a bunch of tasks in one sitting. Rinse out the bowl and blade between jobs if needed, but rejoice in the fact you only have to really clean it once—after several tasks are done! Start with shredding raw vegetables like kohlrabi, cabbage, beets, and carrots. These are great in salads and sautés, and will keep in food-safe cloth bags or glass containers in the fridge until you are ready to throw into a hot pan or just drizzle dressing over and eat. Next, process cauliflower into pebbles for cauliflower rice; the refrigerated raw bits are then minutes away from a simple side dish or a quick risotto. Then blaze through any quick chopping you might need to do, as for a soup: You can run through the mushrooms, onions, and garlic for the Sage and Mushroom Soup [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sms] in seconds. End with whipping up a sauce or two, like the Vegan Nut-Cheese Sauce [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#vncs] or Basic Pesto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bp], to stash in the fridge and use all week long. * Wash and prep ahead: Something as simple as prewashing a variety of greens for sautés, stir-fries, and salads, and storing them in the fridge can make eating more greens easy. Be sure to dry them well before rolling in a clean dishcloth or placing in a food-safe cloth bag and storing in your crisper. * Precook proteins: Precooking a batch of basic proteins—baking pasture-raised chicken, crisping up cubed hemp tofu, or sautéing Quorn crumbles—and stashing in the fridge means you are very close to creating a delicious Buddha bowl or wrap anytime during the week, without ever needing to turn on your stove. The chicken salad here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#prcs] is another great use of precooked chicken, and will last in the fridge a few days. * Pressure-cooking: Pressure-cooking not only removes the lectins from certain foods, but it also cooks items very quickly. Use this to your advantage and get dinner on the table in minutes, without needing to even turn on the stove. After some preliminary vegetable prep, the lentil chili cooks in under twenty minutes. Or consider making a quick batch of pressure-cooked quinoa for use in salads throughout the week. Lastly, don’t sweat it; Eden Brand pressure-cooks all its beans and lentils and has BPA-free cans, so the finished product sits on your shelf ready to go. Last time I looked, I had six varieties of their beans in my pantry. * Repurpose leftovers: Consider doubling a recipe so that you can reuse leftovers in new ways in another meal. This is a great timesaver as you do the work of cooking and cleaning up only once, but get to reap the benefits for more than one meal. One of my favorite examples of this is the Spinach Risotto Cakes [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sprc]. The cauliflower and spinach risotto is decadent on its own, and the leftovers, mixed with a little egg (or egg substitute) and cassava flour, make the most adorable little cakes, delicious with a salad for a very quick and easy dinner. Similarly, lentils, quickly pressure-cooked prior in the week for salads and bowls, can be made into lentil cakes, ready to sauté immediately or freeze for another time. * Waste nothing: Making that pot of garlicky greens soup will result in a pile of kale, collard, or chard stems, something normally relegated to the compost bin. But not so fast! Diced up, the stems are a key component to the Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh]. Using the whole vegetable is a great way to save a little money and to get the most out of those special organic vegetables. Similarly, use your wild shrimp shells to make or fortify stock [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#wcsr], great for soups or risottos. Thinking creatively results in twice the output for your ingredients, which means you are able to increase your value per ingredient. Waste not, want not! I care for a lot of Medicare and Medicaid patients whose food budget is very limited; but time and again they find, with the Plant Paradox, that they save not only on their grocery bill, but also on their medical expenses, which plummet when they reduce or eliminate their need for prescription medications. * Use your freezer: Your freezer is a great storage place for kitchen work you’ve been able to squeeze in here and there. Excess lentil chili, soups, smoothies, muffins, and more can all be frozen in individual servings after cooking for a grab-and-go option that can defrost overnight in the fridge or even in your workbag. Other items, like the lentil cakes here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#lwc], can be formed ahead and frozen, so that all you have to do when you get home from work is sauté them in a pan. Frozen spice cookie dough [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#spc] has also been known to come in handy for a last-minute treat.READY-TO-GO STAPLES, MEALS, AND SNACKSWhen developing recipes for this book, I tried specifically to create meals andsnacks that would be as easy as possible to execute when you might be short ontime. As discussed, to make the program especially quick and easy, one approachis to make food ahead, in batches. Then, often you can use your freezer to helphandle the overflow. This strategy means that if you can spend a little time onthe weekend or one weeknight prepping a few items, then you can spend the restof the week reaping the rewards. Imagine easily whipping up a premeasuredsmoothie for breakfast, then packing a premade salad (including dressing) forlunch, grabbing a bag of spicy nuts for a snack, and coming home to homemadesoup or chili and perhaps a slice of chocolate cake. With these versatilerecipes—conveniently grouped into my favorite Plant Paradox staples, meals, andsnacks—you will be able to do just that.Plant Paradox Staples * Dressings: Salads are a mainstay of the Plant Paradox, and homemade dressings really help to jazz them up. You will find a variety of delicious options in this book, from rich and creamy to bright and acidic, and even more in The Plant Paradox Cookbook. I like to make a recipe’s worth (you can easily double it) once a week so all I have to do is pour it over raw or cooked veggies for a quick lunch. Dressings can also be used to marinate proteins. In fact, once you have a few prepared dressings in your fridge, you’ll be amazed how many uses you’ll find for them. * Sauces: Like the dressings above, preparing a batch of Vegan Nut-Cheese Sauce or Basic Pesto over the weekend or while your coffee brews in the morning will pay off in spades. Use these sauces for noodle bakes, bowls, or roasted veggies. * Guacamole: Especially in Phase 1, you’ll find having a premade batch of guacamole ready to go in your fridge means easy snacks with no extra dishes. Serve with pre-prepped raw veggies like asparagus, celery, and radishes, or scoop into a piece of romaine. To store, transfer guacamole into a container and cover the exposed surface with a little extra avocado oil to keep it from turning brown before putting on a lid. And don’t sweat it: Premade Wholly Guacamole (available at Costco and Walmart) and Trader Joe’s Avocado’s Number Guacamole are convenient and ready to eat, and neither include tomatoes. Wholly Guacamole even comes in individual serving sizes. * Avocado cloud bread: These amazing little bun-like breads are great for stuffing with prosciutto for lunch or serving on the side of some soup. Make the whole recipe’s worth, or even double it, and freeze any you won’t gobble up in two days. Frozen servings can be quickly reheated in the oven or toaster oven and they’ll be ready to go. * Green veggie hash: Since vegetables are such an important part of the Plant Paradox program, having a ready-to-eat sauté of seasoned veggies on hand is surprisingly versatile—our recipe makes 6 (1 1/2 cup) servings to be eaten right away or stashed in the fridge for later in the week. Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh] can be incorporated in breakfast salad or the Miracle Noodle Veggie Bake [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#vb]. It can also be its own meal, especially when topped with half an avocado, whatever cooked protein you have around (salmon, chicken, Quorn crumbles, eggs), or even some simple toasted walnuts.Meals * Smoothies: Smoothies are a mainstay of the Plant Paradox, as you can ingest tons of healthy foods quickly and easily. Plus it’s a portable meal that you can take on your way to the gym, on your commute, or at your desk. My wife and I make smoothies many weekday mornings. One helpful tactic is to prep the ingredients for a bunch of smoothies all at once and divide them up into pre-portioned jars or BPA-free bags for the freezer. Then, all you have to do in the morning is dump the contents of the jar into the blender, add liquid, and blend. You can even pour the finished smoothie right back into the jar for an easy to-go container. * Salads: When packed strategically, a jar can be a great container for a make-ahead salad that can go right from the fridge into your workbag in the morning for a delicious lunch. It all comes down to the layering: dressing on the bottom, dense/heavy ingredients next (like lentils or chicken), then extras like cheese or nuts, topped off with veggies and greens. Since the greens won’t touch anything wet, they won’t wilt, and the whole jar will last in your fridge at least three days. To serve, just invert the whole thing into a bowl and toss. * Muffins and egg muffins: Making a batch of muffins or egg muffins [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gem] once a week guarantees you and your family will have delicious breakfast or lunch options ready to go any day you need to grab something on your way out the door. If you love coconut, try making the Almond Joy muffins, which contain four different coconut products. They will keep on the countertop for up to four days, and you can freeze them to reheat in the microwave. * Stews and soups: Stews, soups, and chili all share the special quality of actually improving in taste after sitting in the fridge overnight. Use this to your advantage and make one or more of these (or a double batch) when you have a little extra time, then store in the fridge or freezer until you’re ready to serve. The Braised Beef and Mushrooms [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bbm], for example, can be made on a lazy Sunday afternoon and served with great fanfare to friends for an after-work get-together. Who says you’re too busy to have people over during the week?Snacks * Hard-boiled eggs: Boiling up a batch of eggs and storing them in the fridge is certainly not a new idea, but it’s still a good one. A hard-boiled egg makes for an energy-dense snack that can be jazzed up all sorts of different ways: with a drizzle of homemade dressing or tahini, a sprinkle of spices, or a dab of avocado mayo. Just remember to buy pasture-raised or omega-3 eggs and limit yourself to a maximum of four per day. * Kale chips: These crispy snacks feel like junk food, but are made exclusively from one of the foods your gut buddies love most: greens! Making your kale chips at home is ideal, but if you do buy them be sure to read labels carefully and keep an eye out for the type of oil they are cooked in; try to purchase varieties cooked in coconut, olive, or red palm oil. Non-GMO canola should only be used as a last resort. * Nut mix: I always have a batch (or three) of this around. While you can eat plain nuts right out of your hand, snazzing them up with garlic and herbs makes them irresistible and really feels like a treat. These are great for snacking of course, but they also happen to be one of the best things to nibble on while having a glass of wine or spritzers with friends. * Simple Chocolate Snack Cake: When you know you have a tough week coming up, do yourself and your family a favor and whip up my Simple Chocolate Snack Cake [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#csc] the weekend before. Nothing laughs in the face of a diet like chocolate cake, but this one is totally compliant with the Plant Paradox plan! It keeps on the counter, covered, for a week. It also makes a great birthday or celebration cake.QUICK “WHAT CAN I EAT NOW?” LISTSWe all have days when our brains are too exhausted to think of new ideas forwhat to eat (although if you stay on the plan, your brain fog will soon clear!).Everyone needs some inspiration sometime, especially if you are short on time.Here are a few super quick ideas:Super Quick Snacks * Half an avocado with extra virgin olive oil and salt * Plain yogurt made from coconut, goat, or sheep milks * Almond butter on a piece of celery * Nut Mix [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#nm] * Hard-boiled egg with avocado mayo * Crudité (radishes, jicama, kohlrabi, etc.) with homemade dressing * Guacamole wrapped in a romaine leaf * Oven-crisped prosciutto * Square of dark chocolate * Energy barSuper Quick Meals * Scrambled eggs (or a quick omelet with one whole egg and three yolks) cooked in extra virgin olive oil * Nori wrapped around leftover salmon salad * Spiralized veggies with a creamy dressing * Cauliflower rice bowl with sautéed greens, kimchi, and a soft-cooked egg * Baked sweet potato with sea salt and goat butter * Sautéed wild fish over pressure-cooked quinoa with Basic Pesto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bp] * Roasted Brussels sprouts with fish sauce and cayenne * Crisped hemp tofu over steamed broccoli or veggie hash with a dash of coconut aminos * Curry-paste broth with poached wild shrimp and wilted greensMENUS FOR ENTERTAINING AND SPECIAL OCCASIONSJust because you’re changing your diet doesn’t mean that you never want tosocialize or celebrate again.

There is one very significant segment of the population that is near anddear to my heart, and they ask me more questions than anyone else when it comesto making the Plant Paradox work in their homes. You guessed it: parents.And so, before we dive into the menus and recipes, I wanted to pause for amoment to offer some tailored advice for families with young children, as wellas those following specialized diets for health, ethical, or religious reasons.First, we will address the needs of families, and I’ll share my top twentykid-friendly Plant Paradox recipes and tons of strategies for makingfamily-friendly meals.Next, we’ll look at how to make the Plant Paradox plan work for vegetarians andvegans. I sometimes like to say that a secret message of the Plant Paradox is toeat vegan, as often as you can—animal protein is definitely not a cornerstone ofthe program, and can be wholly omitted. After seventeen years on the program, Iusually limit animal protein or products to wild fish or shellfish, and those Ieat only on the weekends. I coined the phrase veg-aquarian to describe this wayof eating. So while I am not vegan, I know that the program is extremelyadaptable to both vegetarian and vegan diets.The third section is for those who are struggling with life-threatening diseaseslike diabetes, cancer, and Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Irecommend that they participate in a modified version of the program, the KetoPlant Paradox Intensive Care Program. This program is focused on the needs ofpeople with these particular issues. It’s been a true lifesaver for many of mypatients.Lastly, I’ll share the supplements and lifestyle considerations that can amplifyyour results on the program. This includes water intake and sleep. Whilefollowing these recommendations is completely optional, I do suggest investingin a few basic supplements and working toward better hydration and quality ofsleep.I hope all of my readers feel empowered to participate in the program with thefollowing suggestions, strategies, and adjustments. I know the program can helpeveryone, and want to make sure nobody is left out!MAKING THE PLANT PARADOX FAMILY FRIENDLYI’ll be honest: As a parent, and now a grandparent, I’ve been thinking a lotabout how I can make the Plant Paradox more accessible for readers withfamilies. Not only do many of my patients live at home with children, but I alsohave many patients who are children themselves.I’ve seen firsthand the Plant Paradox program benefit the health of children,who are, sadly, plagued with autoimmune diseases that never existed thirty yearsago. In addition, with the proliferation of inexpensive processed and refinedfoods, often marketed directly to children and even served to them at manyschools, the obesity rates of American children are worse than ever. Theirlectin loads are also particularly high, no doubt in part due to the fact thatpizza (a combination of wheat, casein A1 cheese, and sweetened tomato sauce) andbreaded chicken (soy- and corn-fed chicken, dipped in flour breading and friedin peanut or soybean oil) are some of the most popular and consumed foods.Getting children on a better track from a young age is the best way to ensurefewer diseases later in life and a healthier weight throughout it.Many Plant Paradox dishes are inherently kid-friendly; I kept children in mindwhen developing recipes. But certainly there are a few that children especiallylove, and I’ve listed them here along with some standouts from The Plant Paradoxand The Plant Paradox Cookbook. In addition, I’ve included strategies for makingfood more fun and appealing to kids, as well as a few casual recipe-less mealideas that come in handy in a pinch!MAKING FOOD KID-FRIENDLY * Kid-size servings: Let’s be honest, having something of your very own is much more fun than sharing, especially if you’re a kid. Muffins and egg muffins already come in individual servings, just the right size for a child. * Straws are fun: Though I do suggest using paper or metal straws for environmental reasons, I cannot deny the fact that sipping out of a straw is more fun than using a plain glass. Kids agree with this. Smoothies are great “straw-able” drinks and you can pack them with nutritious greens. * Presentation is everything: Spiralizers and even cookie cutters are wonderful ways to make otherwise boring vegetables (carrots, beets) look fun and inviting. Plus, depending on your spiralizer model, kids can try their hand at making the “noodles” themselves. Of course, getting them involved in the kitchen is also a great way to entice them to try new things. My grandkids love being included in kitchen prep work, and getting their hands dirty makes them even more excited about eating the fruits (or veggies, as the case may be) of their labors! * Include a dipping sauce: Don’t dismiss the power of dipping. Some child favorites include guacamole or the creamy dressings made with tahini. Or whip up a quick goat-yogurt “ranch” with nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, or whatever other flavorings the kids like. * Melt some cheese on it: This parenting hack is as old as time, but it works. Everyone loves some gooey melted cheese, and buffalo or goat mozzarella are becoming easier to find. Goat cheddar and brie can be found at Trader Joe’s. Watch for the increasing availability of casein A2 cheeses and yogurts, all completely fine on the Plant Paradox program. Sprinkle some over cooked veggies and broil in the toaster oven, or make a quick veggie quesadilla or egg burrito with almond or cassava flour or coconut tortillas. Don’t forget, Vegan Nut-Cheese Sauce has that same gooey appeal! * Garden together: The transformation of a seed into a plant is something that is amazing to us all, but especially to kids. Try planting a few veggies (or windowsill herbs, if you are limited on space) with your kids. Involve them in every step, from picking out the seeds to watering the shoots to harvesting the finished products. You’ll be amazed at how willing they are to try new things. It might surprise you and your kids to learn that during World War II, 40 percent of all food eaten in America was grown in family “Victory” gardens. My parents continued this tradition when I was a kid in the 1950s and 1960s—and I repeated it with my own two girls in the 1980s. (And no need to wash your carrots thoroughly, if your garden is organic—the soil contains minerals and soil-based organisms that are good for gut health!) * Emphasize color: Everyone eats with their eyes first, and children are especially prone to this. A colorful array of food on a plate is much more appealing than neutral-colored food. Luckily vegetables come in a rainbow of hues, so make an effort to emphasize color when choosing the components of your meals. * Get sneaky: If you have kids, you know they naturally have an aversion to bitter green vegetables. Young kids often don’t like the texture of leafy greens. It’s okay; those aversions will subside in later years. But here’s a trick worth remembering: You can hide chopped up greens and other veggies in muffins and cookies without affecting the taste or texture. Eggs are another great vehicle for getting your kids to eat greens—add some finely chopped spinach to their scrambled eggs and voila! You have fun, delicious “green eggs.” * Individualization: Everyone likes things their own way, so why not let kids have some independence when it comes to making their meals? (It’s much nicer than watching your children pick out the bits they don’t want.) Deconstructing a recipe into its finished parts and presenting it salad bar–style means everyone can create something just to their liking. The Buddha Bowl [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bud] and Sesame Miracle Noodle Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#smns] are great contenders for this strategy. And for goodness’ sake, have kids help make pancakes, cookies, and muffins like my own grandkids do with their mother and father. It’s much more likely picky kids will eat their own creations!TOP 20 KID-FRIENDLY PLANT PARADOX RECIPESBreakfasts * Green Egg Muffins [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gem] * Almond Joy Muffins [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#ajm] * Smoothies of any kind [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#ggs] * Sorghum porridge with dried fruit and chopped pecans * Alternative-flour waffles and pancakes (see Coconut Macadamia Waffles and Chocolate Chip Mini Pancakes in The Plant Paradox Cookbook, for example)Lunches and Dinners * Avocado Cloud Bread [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#acb] —plain or spread with almond butter, organic cream cheese, etc. * Collard-Wrapped Burritos [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bur] * Sesame Miracle Noodle Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#smns] * One-Pan Chicken and Veggies [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#cv] * Miracle Noodle Veggie Bake [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#vb] * Pressure-Cooked Lentil Chili [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#lc] * Cauliflower-crust pizza (see The Plant Paradox Cookbook or purchase frozen crusts) * Sweet-potato spaghetti and meatballs (see The Plant Paradox Cookbook)Snacks and Sweets * Guacamole [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#guac] or Nutty Green Salad Dressing [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#dressing2] with raw carrots or other vegetables * Kale Chips [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#kale] * Coconut- or goat-milk yogurt, sweetened with an approved sweetener and a couple of drops of vanilla * Spice Cookies [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#spc] * Chocolate Coconut Ice Pops [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#ccip]KID-FRIENDLY RECIPE-LESS MEAL IDEAS * Fried rice: Stir fry favorite veggies with minced scallions, garlic, and ginger, add a scrambled egg, and season with fish sauce or coconut animos. It’s a super-quick weeknight meal both children and adults will love. Throw in some Quorn grounds or Chik’n Tenders and you’ve got a great vegetarian meal. * Taco bowl bar: Disassemble the Quorn Taco Salad recipe [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts] and serve over cooked millet, letting everyone make their own bowl. * Cheesy bake: Almost anything tastes great topped with Vegan Nut-Cheese Sauce, goat cheddar, or cheese from Italy or France and baked. Try your children’s favorite veggies (roasted or steamed broccoli or cauliflower are classic) or slabs of roasted hemp tofu or tempeh. Any alternative noodle or rice would be delicious too, especially with a handful of spinach added. * Pesto “pasta”: “Foodles” or spiralized vegetables taste great with pesto and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Experiment with the nuts you use for Basic Pesto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bp]; instead of pine nuts, try walnuts or pistachios. * Baked sweet-potato and yam bar: Everyone gets their own baked sweet potato (have different colors to try) and can choose their own toppings: green veggie hash, shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano, lentil chili, organic sour cream, crisped prosciutto—there are so many possibilities! * Wraps or burritos (using collards, nori, or approved tortillas): Fill with baked fish, Quorn Chik’n Tenders or Cutlets, tuna salad, or pasture-raised chicken. Serve with Lentil-Walnut Cakes Dressing [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#dressing1] for dipping, if you like, or go in a Mexican direction with Fruit Salsa [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#fs], shredded cheese, and guacamole. * Goat-milk ice-cream sundaes: This isn’t a meal exactly, but is a very fun dessert. Possible toppings include grated dark chocolate, popped sorghum, unsweetened toasted coconut, and chopped nuts.MAKING THE PLANT PARADOX PROGRAM VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN FRIENDLYAs I’ve said before, vegetarianism and veganism are eating styles that alignvery well with the Plant Paradox. The Plant Paradox nutrition plan is focusedprimarily on vegetables—leafy, cruciferous, and resistant starches—and fats fromolive oils and nuts, and this base is completely vegetarian and vegan. Inaddition, my research and that of my colleagues has found that many of ourhealth problems today stem from our overconsumption of animal proteins andproducts. For example, the antibiotic content of many of the animal-based foodswe eat causes weight gain and other digestive issues, and eliminating thesefoods puts an end to these problems. In fact, completely avoiding animal proteinhas produced the greatest longevity among some of the world’s longest-livingpeople. I believe so much in the benefits of lessening one’s animal proteinintake that I advocate to limit or eliminate it permanently.The main reason that the Plant Paradox program isn’t vegan is because I believethere are a few worthwhile benefits found in wild fish, so I partake in a smallamount. Furthermore, I want to be able to reach as many people as possible and Iknow from some of my patients that reducing animal protein is easier to stomach(no pun intended) than completely eliminating it. But please hear me:Vegetarians and vegans, I truly understand you and want to be sure toaccommodate you. Unfortunately as I’ve learned over the last seventeen years,many of the mainstays of the American vegetarian or vegan diets—namely grains,whole-grain pastas and non-pressure-cooked beans and soy—are the very foods thatcause a great deal of damage to the gut.THE PROTEIN ISSUEThe perceived complicating issue with vegetarianism and veganism is consumingadequate protein. Vegetarians’ and vegans’ most popular source of protein comesfrom grains, beans, legumes, and tofu, which are all no-nos in the Plant Paradoxbecause of their high lectin load. But this is a very workable issue! Let meexplain.Beans and legumes are wonderful sources of plant-based protein. Properlyprepared, they can extend longevity and improve memory, and our gut buddies lovethem. Thus, the good news is that they can be acceptable on the Plant Paradox,with the caveat that they must be processed in a particular way beforeingesting. Specifically, they need to be pressure-cooked, which drasticallyreduces the lectin content of these foods. After Phase 1, the gut-cleansing andgut-healing stage, vegetarians and vegans can slowly reintroduce pressure-cookedbeans and legumes back into their diet. If tolerated well, they are perfectlyacceptable in small quantities. (You might notice that non-vegetarians andnon-vegans are asked to wait to reintroduce these until Phase 3.) Why notconsume large quantities? Quite simply, their carbohydrate content is much toohigh to be eaten in large amounts, with the exception of lentils.It’s also worth noting that we do not need nearly as much protein in our dietsas we think. You can calculate your daily protein needs by dividing your weightin pounds by 2.2 (to get your weight in kilograms), then multiplying that numberby 0.37. The result is the number of grams of protein your body requires eachday. Furthermore, our bodies slough off protein every day into our intestinesand mucus, and those shed proteins are actually reingested. Because of this, ourprotein needs from food are likely about half of what that calculation willconclude. In Phase 3, I reduce my recommendation for protein consumption evenfurther.And lastly, there are plenty of protein sources that are often overlooked in avegetarian diet. Vegetables are a great place to start. For example, a cup ofsteamed cauliflower provides 2 grams of protein, as does a medium baked sweetpotato; a half cup of cooked spinach provides about 3 grams of protein, and awhole artichoke or avocado each provide about 4 grams. In addition, hemp tofu,grain-free tempeh, and hemp protein powder are excellent sources of protein.Vegetarians can also find copious amounts of protein in eggs, cheese, nuts, andunsweetened yogurts.MAKING THE VEGAN/VEGETARIAN PLANT PARADOX EASYTo make it easy, every recipe in this book, if not already vegetarian or vegan,offers a variation to make it so. In general, smoothies that use whey proteinpowder can instead be made with hemp protein powder, and chicken or fish can beswapped out for tempeh, hemp tofu, or a delicious seared “steak” of cauliflower.The savory, nutty flavor of nutritional yeast is my favorite cheesealternative—one of the tastiest uses of the stuff is here[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#vncs], in a creamy, “cheesy” sauce made from rawmacadamia nuts that is great on pasta. Egg replacements, like Bob’s Red Mill EggReplacement, work just as well as eggs in Risotto Cakes or our Green EggMuffins.KETO PLANT PARADOX INTENSIVE CARE PROGRAMFor some of my patients and readers, an extreme medical condition likeParkinson’s, diabetes, ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, or cancer is what introducesthem to the Plant Paradox. I have had scores of patients, often in the latestages of a life-threatening disease, for whom the Plant Paradox and myfacility—the Center for Restorative Medicine—is their last resort. So toaccommodate their particular needs, I developed the Keto Plant Paradox IntensiveCare Program.Why do certain diseases require a specific diet? It comes down to our ability(or inability) to utilize ketones, a form of stored fat, as fuel. Under normalcircumstances, our mitochondria, the energy centers of our cells, processketones into energy when sugar and protein are unavailable—like when we aresleeping, or, for our ancestors, in the winter, when food was scarce. (This ishow bears are able to hibernate.) But when insulin levels are high (like theyare for 80 percent of Americans who are overweight or obese), ketones cannot begenerated from all that stored fat. And high insulin levels promote more fatstorage, while actually stimulating cancer cells to grow. Finally, high insulinlevels block sugar from getting to nerve cells, or neurons, causing them tosputter to a stop. The results: excess weight, low energy, high insulin, and avulnerability to diseases like cancer (this array of symptoms are sometimescollectively referred to as “type 3 diabetes”).For patients, the solution to this high-insulin, mitochondrial dysfunction istwofold: The first piece is that these patients must adopt a low-sugar,low-carb, and low-protein diet in order to lower their insulin levels, allowingthe production of ketones from stored fats, which mitochondria will be able touse as their preferred energy source. The second piece is that these patientsneed to begin eating foods that can be directly converted to ketones, an energysource that our mitochondria—especially those in our brains and hearts—prefer.Some plants contain fats that can be converted to ketones—and your diet willspecialize in these. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are 100 percent convertedto ketones; solid coconut oil (meaning it is solid below about 70 degrees)contains about 65 percent MCTs; red palm oil or palm fruit oil, is about 50percent MCTs; and lastly, butter, goat butter, and ghee contain the short-chainfatty acid butyrate, another small source of ketones. In this intensive careprogram, fat is our friend! In fact, about 80 percent of all the calories youeat every day should come from approved fats.The Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program is designed to particularlyaddress the distinctive dietary and biological constraints that go along withthese major diseases.

Initially concentrate on medium-chain fatty acids or the short-chain fatty acids in butter or ghee, as too much coconut oil or MCT oil in too short a time can upset your stomach. Three tablespoons spread out across the day is a good start, then work your way up to what your system can tolerate (in terms of loose bowels). MCTs are flavorless, making them a perfect addition to smoothies. * Greens, other acceptable vegetables, and resistant starches take on the role of being fat-delivery devices. My Keto Plant Paradox patients have heard me say that the only purpose of food is to get fat into their mouths. Try simmering cauliflower in canned coconut cream with curry powder and eat it with a spoon. Truly drench your salads with olive oil, perilla oil, macadamia nut oil, or better yet, a one-to-one blend of any of these oils with MCT oil. * Almost all fruits and all seeded veggies (even pressure-cooked) are not appropriate on the keto variation of the program. The exceptions are avocados, green bananas and plantains, green mangos, green papayas, and okra (that mucousy part actually binds to lectins like a magnet). But again, even these are only there to get fat into your mouth. * Macadamias are the preferred nut; other nuts take a supporting role. * Animal protein is reduced. Two to four ounces of it—the size of a deck of cards—is your daily limit, preferably in the form of wild-caught fish, shellfish, and mollusks. If you have cancer, try eliminating animal proteins altogether. (Animal protein contains amino acids that cancer cells need.) Great protein (with fat) options for vegans and those with cancer include half of a Hass avocado with a dollop of coconut oil, hemp seeds, and walnuts. * The fat in egg yolks is a type your brain needs to function properly. A great brain-food meal: a three-yolk, one-whole-egg omelet, cooked in coconut oil or ghee, filled with sliced avocado, mushrooms, and onions, sprinkled with turmeric, and splashed with more ghee or macadamia, perilla, or olive oil before serving. Vegans, stick with avocado and hemp seeds. * The sugar-free coconut-milk frozen dessert remains an option, but the goat-milk ice cream is a no-no. * Extra dark chocolate needs to contain at least 90 percent cacao. (Lindt is delicious.) I prefer the 100 percent from Trader Joe’s or the 99 percent from World Market. * Intermittent fasting is especially effective early in the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program because it gives a much-needed break to your overstressed mitochondria. But in your particular condition, you don’t yet have the metabolic agility to burn the stored fat in your body between meals. So to prevent brain fog, weakness, or dizziness while fasting, supplement a few times a day with a tablespoon of MCT oil or coconut oil. (Conveniently, Artisana, Kelapo, Carrington Farms, and Spectrum all offer single-serving packets of coconut oil, which makes it easy to ingest your boost if you are on the go.) Another option during intermittent fasting is to eat an Adapt bar. After a month or two, try eliminating one of these supplementary doses of oil. If you feel OK, you can begin to stretch out the time between meals. * In addition to the supplements I recommend for everyone following the Plant Paradox program (see below [Chapter_6_Special_Conside.xhtml#ah4-L4]), potassium and magnesium intake must be supplemented when on the keto program. These two minerals are responsible for keeping muscle cells from cramping (a common complaint early in the keto program). The supplement potassium magnesium aspartate—a combination of 99 milligrams of potassium and 299 or 300 milligrams of magnesium—can stop the cramps. I suggest taking one twice a day.Patients who follow the Keto Plant Paradox Intensive Care Program remain on itfor different periods of time, depending heavily on the individual’s medicalneeds. If you have or have had cancer or neurological or memory issues, I urgeyou to stay on the keto plan for the rest of your life. Those with obesity,diabetes, or kidney issues who have succeeded in achieving improved health onthe keto version may be able to switch to the regular Plant Paradox Program(Phase 2) after two or three months. Of course, if you do not respond well aftergoing off the keto program, return to it immediately.Remember, no matter which Plant Paradox program you choose, or what phase youhave reached, the protocol is not a race to the finish. The goal is to discovera life- and health-affirming program you can enjoy long-term. Your role is tomake the best choices possible and do what you can do, with what you’ve got,wherever you are. But if you make a mistake, you don’t need to beat yourselfup—simply just get back on track. Once you experience the health benefits of anyof the Plant Paradox programs, you’ll be motivated to stay on the path.SUPPLEMENTSSupplements are an important part of the Plant Paradox. Like the food we eat,the right supplements can play a large role in protecting and healing our gut.They are also needed because the food that we eat has much less inherentnutrition than it used to due to modern-day farming practices. The soil has beendepleted of vitamins, minerals, and its own microbes, so the plants that grow init are depleted of these micronutrients as well.Because of these factors, I recommend the following supplement protocol to allof my patients.VITAMIN DAbout 80 percent of my patients, and close to 100 percent of my autoimmunepatients, are vitamin D deficient when I meet them. Most of us are. Sincevitamin D plays a very important role in helping your immune system to function,your bones to stay strong, and your favorable intestinal flora and gut wall tobe healthy, it is, in my opinion, perhaps the most important supplement. Bottomline: Everyone should take at least 5,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily; if you havean autoimmune condition, take 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily.B VITAMINSB vitamins help protect the inner lining of your blood vessels. Unfortunatelyabout half the population is unable to convert folic acid and vitamin B12 intotheir active forms due to a genetic mutation, so you may not be getting enough Bvitamins in a form your body can use. To compensate, I recommend: * 1,000 micrograms a day of methylfolate (the active form of folic acid) * 1,000 to 5,000 micrograms a day of methyl B12 (the active form of vitamin B12), under the tongue.GREEN PLANT PHYTOCHEMICALSYour gut buddies love greens, and supplements complement the ones you arealready eating. Just be careful not to take one that contains lectin-richgrasses such as wheatgrass, barley grass, or oat grass. I recommend thefollowing: * Spinach extract, 1,000 milligrams daily * 100 milligrams daily of DIM (diindolylmethane), an immune-boosting compound found in broccoliPOLYPHENOLSPhytochemicals improve cardiovascular health and support gut bacteria.(Interestingly, in nature they protect plants from insects and sun damage.) Irecommend taking one or a combination of the following: * Grape seed extract, 100 milligrams daily * Pine bark extract, 25 to 100 milligrams daily * Resveratrol (the polyphenol in red wine), 100 milligrams dailyPREBIOTICSPrebiotics are like fertilizer for your gut buddies; they feed and nourish,support your immunity, and keep you regular. Good prebiotic supplements include: * Psyllium husks, a teaspoon a day in water, working up to a tablespoon per day * Inulin powder, a teaspoon a day (the sweetener Just Like Sugar is primarily inulin)LECTIN BLOCKERSNo matter how closely you follow the program, you cannot avoid all lectins inyour diet. So it helps to have some lectin-fighting compounds in your system. Irecommend: * Glucosamine, a building block of cartilage, occurs naturally in the fluid that surrounds and protects your joints. It also binds to inflammatory lectins and reduces pain. Take one Osteo Bi-Flex or Move Free daily (sold at Costco and many other big-box retailers). * 1,000 milligrams a day of D-mannose (divided into two doses of 500 milligrams each); the active ingredient, found in cranberries, is an effective lectin blocker.SUGAR BLOCKERSTo keep blood glucose levels at a healthy level, I recommend: * CinSulin, two capsules daily: a combination of chromium and cinnamon available at Costco * Zinc, 30 milligrams daily * Selenium, 150 micrograms daily * Berberine, also called Oregon grape root, 250 milligrams twice a day * Turmeric extract, 200 milligrams twice a dayOMEGA-3SOmega-3 fats are vital to the health of both your gut and your brain. In fact,our brain is composed of 60 percent fat, and half of that is a long-chainomega-3 fat called DHA. But unless you’re eating sardines or herring every day,you most likely need to supplement. I recommend: * 1,000 mg of DHA per day from fish oil, molecularly distilled and from small fish such as sardines and anchovies. Brands I like include Nature’s Bounty at Costco, which has 253 milligrams of DHA per capsule; OmegaVia DHA 600; and Carlson Elite Omega-3 Gems. Another great alternative is Carlson’s cod liver oil, a tablespoon a day. Vegans and vegetarians can take 1000 milligrams of algal DHA capsules instead.Lastly, if you have a digestive disorder or autoimmune disease, the rightnatural supplement will be helpful in killing bad gut bacteria, molds, andfungi. In these cases, include the following in your daily routine: * Oregon grape root extract or its active ingredient berberine * Mushrooms and/or mushroom extracts * Spices such as black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, wormwood, ginger, and DGL to kill parasites, fungi, and other bad gut floraLIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONSHere are a few lifestyle changes I urge you to consider as you dive into thePlant Paradox program.SLEEPSleep is vitally important; it’s a time for our bodies to heal and rest. Irecommend at least eight hours of sleep a night. I suggest setting a goal ofgetting more and better-quality sleep as part of the larger protocol.Also note that outside factors can affect our sleep. As discussed in Chapter 4[Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml], blue light is one of the deadly disruptors.It can be found in the screens we now rely so heavily on—our phones, computers,and televisions—and it has the unfortunate repercussion of making our bodiesthink it’s perpetually summer, prompting fat storage. It also suppresses ourbodies’ manufacture of melatonin, which helps us fall asleep. The bottom line:Avoid blue light as much as possible in the evening.HYDRATIONDuring weight loss or ketosis, uric acid can build up in your bloodstream andcause gout or kidney stones. For that reason, please aim to drink eight glassesof water a day, and consider adding more salt to your diet temporarily. Pleasemake sure it’s iodized sea salt; consider using Morton’s Lite Salt, which haspotassium chloride. Sparkling water also counts. I like San Pellegrino oranother Italian high-pH sparkling water. (Most American sparkling waters have alow pH, indicating that they are acidic.)However, be sure not to drink your water from plastic water bottles, which ofteninclude bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol s (BPS), and are also awful for theenvironment. Try instead a stainless steel or glass bottle (best are the oneswith a protective wrapper) filled with filtered or good-quality tap water—I’mpartial to the types that keep the beverage at the temperature you started with.I personally use a DYLN stainless steel bottle, which makes water alkaline.OTHER MEDICATIONSMany readers and my patients have weaned off and/or reduced their medicationsfor blood pressure, cholesterol, antacids, diabetes, and immunosuppressants, butplease do this only under your health care provider’s supervision."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7WEEKLY MEAL PLANS [nav.xhtml#nch11]We’ve discussed the importance of planning ahead in previous chapters, andhere’s where it all comes into focus. In this chapter you will find detailedmeal plans and menus, in addition to weekly prep lists. Before you start eachnew week of the Plant Paradox 30-day challenge, I suggest getting organized andstocking your fridge and freezer with ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook dishes.It’s like setting out your gym clothes the night before; once you’ve done thatpiece, it’s easier to follow through. With weekly prep under your belt,breakfast, lunch, and dinner are simple to execute, and everything comestogether in a snap.Also, feel free to swap out any of the recipes or snacks in the meal plans withothers detailed in the rest of the book. These meal plans are provided only togive you a quick template of what you can eat for thirty days, in case that ishelpful. If you prefer to make your own weekly menus, just be sure the food youare planning coordinates with the correct phase you are in. (Check out the handychart [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#chart] for an at-a-glance guide to foods that canbe consumed in each phase.) Remember, for the 30-day challenge, we start with afull week of Phase 1, then move on to two weeks of Phase 2, then end (if you aredoing well) with Phase 3—which can last a lifetime.I find it helpful to create a shopping list so I can make my prep dayproductive. Be sure to include the food you will need for that week’s recipes,any special pantry items you like to keep stocked (like Miracle Noodles,approved Quorn products, and raw nuts), a couple of treats to keep youmotivated, and any supplements you need.Lastly, remember that, in addition to the food listed here, you can also drinkas much herbal, green, white, or black tea as you like, and have black coffee aswell. Be sure to drink a lot of water too, especially in Phase 1. I like to filla couple of stainless steel or glass water bottles at night so they’re ready forme to grab on my way out the door in the morning.#PlantParadox30As you are gearing up for the 30-day challenge, don’t forget to check in online,both on the blogs and on social media.

You made it through the 30-day challenge! See here[Chapter_3_How_It_Works.xhtml#ah5-L4] for life after the quick-start plan, butin the meantime, revel in the fact that you have given your body an amazinggift: the chance to heal itself and function as it should. There’s no questionthat you are already healthier now than you were a mere month ago."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8RECIPES [nav.xhtml#nch12]As this book focuses on making the Plant Paradox program as quick and easy aspossible, I made sure to configure the recipes to be part of a larger strategythat made the prep and cooking flow more easily. When I developed the recipes Iconsidered the following: * I developed more recipes that were freezer friendly and could be prepped ahead, for families and weekday warriors who might have trouble preparing three separate meals a day. You can prep smoothies or salad dressing days ahead and eat them all week. * Batch cooking is encouraged, so that you can quickly pressure-cook a pot of lentils and use them in a variety of different meals. * Some recipes are made entirely from the Plant Paradox pantry, so with a stocked kitchen, you can prepare meals without needing to go to the market. * When making weekly shopping and recipe lists, I considered waste and reusability as much as possible (a savings of time and money as well). For example, the stems of the kale or chard used in a salad or soup get chopped up for a starring role in my delicious breakfast hash rather than getting composted. * I developed menus that compensate for leftovers: Leftover fruit salsa originally made to top a piece of fish becomes the star of a Taco Salad (see recipe [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts]) a few days later. Excess risotto is transformed into an entirely different and equally delicious meal in the Risotto Cakes (recipes here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sprc] and here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#shmpr]). Form them in the morning in the time it takes for your coffee to brew, and that night dinner can be on the table in ten minutes.The recipes that follow directly coordinate with the meal plans in Chapter 7[Chapter_7_Weekly_Meal_Pla.xhtml]. That said, any Phase 1 recipe can be eaten ina later phase as well—so just to give you some additional flexibility, whenrelevant, I’ve added notes regarding optional additions you could make to theserecipes in Phase 2 or 3 to mix things up.Lastly, I made sure that every recipe had a vegetarian and vegan variation, andincluded notes to make keto-compliant as needed, so everyone doing the programwould have as many options as possible. Enjoy!BreakfastGreen Ginger SmoothieWith a little kick from the ginger and mint, this smoothie is one of myfavorites, very fresh and slightly spicy. Feel free to swap out the romaine forspinach if you like a slightly more bitter “green” flavor.Makes 4 smoothie packsIngredients * 4 cups chopped romaine lettuce * 1 cup mint leaves * 2 avocados * 2 Tbsp minced fresh ginger * To finish each smoothie: * 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk or filtered tap water (not coconut water!) * Juice of 1/4 lemon * 5–6 drops vanilla liquid steviaInstructions 1. Assemble each smoothie pack: Place 1 cup of chopped romaine, 1/4 cup of mint leaves, 1/2 avocado, and 1/2 Tbsp minced ginger into 4 BPA-free freezer bags or 4 glass jars. Freeze packs until needed (can be frozen for up to 3 months). 2. To make each smoothie: Empty contents of 1 smoothie pack into your blender carafe. Add coconut milk or filtered tap water, lemon juice, and liquid stevia. 3. Blend until smooth; if needed, add more water until sippable. Serve immediately.Almond Joy MuffinsThese higher-protein muffins are inspired by the classic flavors of an AlmondJoy candy bar: coconut (used in four forms—coconut flour, coconut milk, coconutoil, and shredded coconut), almond (both flour and slivered), and chocolate. Butthese don’t have all that sugar, so you can enjoy them guilt free. If you are inPhase 2, use avocado oil instead of coconut oil.Makes 12 muffinsIngredients * 1 cup almond meal * 1/2 cup coconut flour * 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut * 6 Tbsp erythritol * 1 tsp baking soda * 3 omega-3 or pastured eggs (or vegan egg substitute, see notes) * 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut milk * 4 Tbsp melted coconut oil or avocado oil (see headnote) * 1 tsp vanilla extract * 1 tsp almond extract * 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate (at least 72% cacao) * 1/2 cup slivered blanched (skinless) almondsInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with papers and set aside. 2. In a large bowl, combine almond meal, coconut flour, coconut, erythritol, and baking soda. Whisk, and set aside. 3. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, coconut milk, coconut or avocado oil, and the vanilla and almond extracts. 4. Add wet ingredients to dry and fold until just combined. 5. Add chocolate and fold to combine. 6. Transfer batter to prepared muffin tin, then sprinkle the tops with the slivered almonds. 7. Bake 20–25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each muffin comes out clean. 8. Serve or store according to instructions.Meal Prep Note: To store the muffins, keep in an airtight container on thecounter for 3–4 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. To thaw,leave at room temperature overnight, microwave for 15 seconds, or heat in a300°F oven until warm, about 10 minutes.Vegan Notes: Use a Gundry-approved egg replacer[Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#eggrep] such as a flaxseed egg or Bob’s RedMill Egg Substitute, Namaste Raw Foods Egg Replacer, or Orgran Vegan Easy Egg inplace of the eggs.Green Egg MuffinsThese super flavorful, bright-green muffins are a satisfying way to eat yourveggies—even if you’re not a big “vegetables for breakfast” person. You can makethem with any greens you love, or even cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli.Try them drizzled with a little olive oil or with the dressing from theBreakfast Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bksld].Makes 12 muffinsIngredients * 10 omega-3 or pastured eggs * 1 1/2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil * 1 yellow onion, minced * 2 cups shredded kale, stems removed* * 2 cups baby spinach * 1 tsp sea salt * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/2 tsp nutmeg * 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk * 1/2 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or 1/2 cup nutritional yeast*Save stems for the Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh]Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with papers and set aside. 2. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Set aside. 3. In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. 4. Add onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 2–3 minutes. 5. Add kale and spinach, along with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and cook until greens are wilted. 6. Transfer greens mixture to a high-speed blender, add the coconut milk, and blend until smooth. 7. Blend in the eggs and the cheese, then pour the mixture into the muffin tins, filling each tin 2/3 full. 8. Bake until set, about 15–20 minutes. 9. Serve immediately or store according to instructions.Meal Prep Notes: These can be made ahead in large batches. Store in an airtightcontainer for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 3 months in the freezer.To reheat, either microwave, covered, until warm, about 1–2 minutes, or heat ina pan with a little water.Vegan Notes: To make a vegan version, skip the eggs and cheese, and fold theblended greens mixture into 3 cups of sautéed cauliflower rice[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bcr] or pressure-cooked lentils[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#pcbl] (lentils in Phase 2 are fine if you’re vegan).Mix in 3 eggs’ worth of egg-replacer [Chapter_4_Stock_Your_Kitc.xhtml#eggrep]and the nutritional yeast, and bake 20 minutes, until set.Baked Avocado Cups with PestoYes, you can cook avocados—and you end up with a grab-and-go breakfast you caneat with a spoon. They are good both hot or room temperature. If you’re not apesto fan, just skip it, and serve drizzled with a little extra dressing.Makes 4 avocado cupsIngredients * 2 avocados * 4 slices prosciutto (optional) * 4 omega-3 or pastured eggs, medium size if possible * 1/4 cup basil pesto, store-bought or homemade [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bp] * Zest of 1 lemon * Pesto or dressing of your choice (here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bp]), for servingInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Set aside a muffin tin or 4 ramekins to hold avocados upright. (You can also make collars out of foil and place on a baking sheet, if you prefer.) 2. Cut avocados in half, remove pits, and carefully scoop out extra avocado flesh, as needed, to make a “bowl” (or indentation) large enough for one egg.* 3. If using prosciutto, carefully line the avocado “bowls” with prosciutto. 4. Arrange avocados in the muffin tin or ramekins, and carefully crack an egg into each one. 5. Spoon 1 Tbsp of pesto (or other dressing) on top of each egg, and sprinkle with lemon zest. 6. Bake 10–15 minutes, until egg is cooked to your liking. 7. Serve plain or drizzled with your favorite dressing.*Save the extra avocado for guacamole [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#guac] or togarnish your favorite salad. A little extra avocado is ALWAYS a good thing!Meal Prep Notes: This dish is great room temperature or warm, so feel free tomake it up to 3 days ahead, and keep in the fridge. It does not freeze well.Vegan Notes: Leave out the eggs and prosciutto. If you’d like a little moreprotein, fold some tahini into the pesto (it’s delicious!). Or, if you’re onPhase 3, try filling the bowls with pressure-cooked lentils[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#pcbl].Breakfast SaladSalad for breakfast is a great way to get a nutritious and hearty start to theday, and don’t worry—this isn’t just lettuce! A mix of broccoli slaw, leftoverveggie hash, avocado, and mint get tossed with the mixed greens of your choicefor something super satisfying.Makes 1 saladIngredients * 2 Tbsp Breakfast Salad Dressing [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#dressing4] * 1/2 cup Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh]—room temperature or chilled * 1/2 cup raw broccoli slaw * 1/2 avocado, diced * 1/4 cup mint leaves, roughly chopped * 2 cups mixed greens**Spring mix or “power mix” from the grocery store is great, or you can assembleyour own green mix with a combination of 1 part spinach, 1 part chopped lettuce,1 part arugula, and 1 part kale.Instructions 1. In a large bowl, toss together the dressing, hash, broccoli slaw, and avocado. 2. Combine mint leaves and mixed greens. 3. Scoop hash mixture over the greens mixture and serve.Phase 2–3 Notes: Try this salad with some smoked wild-caught salmon, a littleprosciutto, a couple of hard-cooked omega-3 or pastured eggs, or even somepressure-cooked quinoa [Chapter_5_Quick_and_Easy_.xhtml#q] for an interestingtwist.Green Veggie HashThis substantial and delicious mix of green veggies and onions is seasoned withsavory breakfast spices and roasted until browned and caramelized. Great on itsown, with an egg on top (in Phase 2 or 3), or as a component for all sorts ofother recipes, I recommend making at least one batch a week to satisfy yourcravings. Plus, this recipe is a great way to use up stems from your favoriteleafy greens, so you save a bit of money and have less food waste, too.Makes 6 servingsIngredients * 1/4 cup avocado oil * 1/4 cup fresh minced rosemary * 1 1/2 tsp sea salt * 3/4 tsp cumin * 3/4 tsp garlic powder * 1/2 tsp onion powder * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/4 tsp paprika * 4 cups diced broccoli * 3 cups quartered brussels sprouts * 2 cups asparagus, trimmed and chopped into bite-size pieces * 1 cup stems from your favorite greens, diced* * 1 large onion, diced*Such as chard, kale, and collard greens. The Garlicky Greens Soup[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#grsp] and the Taco Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts]are recipes that use just the greens’ leaves, so are good contenders for extrastems.Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 400°F. 2. In a large bowl, combine the avocado oil, rosemary, sea salt, cumin, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, and paprika. 3. Add broccoli, brussels sprouts, asparagus, stems, and onion to the bowl of seasoning and toss until well combined. 4. Spread veggie mixture onto 2 sheet trays. Bake 10–15 minutes, until veggies begin to get tender. 5. Swap the placement of the trays, so the veggies on the bottom rack end up on top, and the veggies on the top rack end up on the bottom. 6. Bake an additional 5–10 minutes, until edges of vegetables are golden brown and vegetables are very tender. 7. Serve immediately, or let cool to room temperature before storing.Phase 2 or 3 Notes: Go ahead and serve a couple of omega-3 or pastured eggs withyour hash, cooked your favorite way. You can also cook with olive oil instead ofavocado oil, if you’d like.Vegan Notes: If you want something a little heartier, add 1/2 avocado or 1/4 cuptoasted walnuts to your hash.Meal Prep Notes: It’s easy to make a big batch of this hash. Portion it into11/2 cup portions (or 1/2 cup portions for breakfast salad), and eitherrefrigerate or freeze each portion in a pint-size jar. They keep in the fridgefor up to 5 days, and the freezer for up to 3 months. When you’re ready toreheat, simply sauté with a little avocado oil, or microwave until hot, ifyou’re short on time.LunchNutty Green SaladThis herbaceous salad, creamy with avocado, crunchy with broccoli slaw andseasoned nuts, makes for a delicious lunch where every bite is different fromthe last. Though you may have been told never to make a salad ahead of time,this one makes a great to-go meal—just be sure to read the notes below fordirections on how to layer in a jar. Your coworkers will be jealous!Makes 1 saladIngredients * 1/2 cup broccoli slaw * 1/2 avocado, diced* * 1/4 cup fresh minced herbs (any mixture of mint, basil, thyme, tarragon, dill, or parsley—whatever you’ve got left over) * 1/4 cup Nut Mix 3.0 [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#nm] * 2–3 Tbsp Nutty Green Salad Dressing [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#dressing2]. * 2 cups mixed greens*If making this ahead, toss your avocado in a little lemon juice to keep it niceand green.Instructions 1. In a large bowl, toss together slaw, avocado, herbs, nuts, and salad dressing. 2. Arrange greens in a bowl, top with slaw mixture, and serve.Meal Prep Notes: If you want to make this ahead of time, I suggest assembling itin a jar—start by putting the dressing on the bottom, followed by the nuts,avocado (tossed in a little lemon), broccoli slaw, herbs, and greens. When it’stime to eat, simply invert the jar into a bowl or plate.Phase 2–3 Notes: Try this salad topped with wild-caught salmon, hard-boiledomega-3 or pastured eggs, or a little prosciutto for something special. It’salso delicious with my Risotto Cakes (here [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sprc] andhere [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#shmpr]) and my Lentil-Walnut Cakes[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#lwc].Pasture-Raised Chicken SaladI’ve always loved classic chicken salad—and honestly, I find chicken salad overgreens to be one of the most satisfying lunches. This version has all theflavors of traditional chicken salad, plus an addictive crunch from the jicama.Bonus: It’s a great way to use up leftover chicken.Makes 4 generous servingsIngredients * 1 1/2 cups chopped, cooked pasture-raised chicken (light or dark meat is OK) * 1 yellow onion, minced * 3–4 ribs celery, minced * 1 cup diced and peeled jicama * 1 Tbsp minced dill * 1 Tbsp minced parsley * 2 ripe avocados * 2 Tbsp avocado oil * Juice of 1 lemon * 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar * 1 Tbsp dijon mustard * 1 tsp sea saltInstructions 1.

For a lighter soup, try itwithout the coconut milk—instead just double the broth or water.Makes 6 generous servingsIngredients * 3 Tbsp avocado oil, divided * 1 large head cauliflower, outer leaves removed, coarsely chopped* * 2 pounds mushrooms, trimmed and finely diced * 1 onion, diced * 2 celery ribs, diced * 2 cloves garlic, minced * 1 Tbsp fresh minced sage * 1 tsp fresh thyme * Zest of one lemon * 11/2 tsp iodized sea salt * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/2 tsp onion powder * 1/2 tsp dried mustard powder * 3 cups unsweetened coconut milk * 3 cups water or homemade chicken or vegetable broth * Coconut aminos, optional (to taste)*Or 4 cups precut cauliflower florets, if you’re in a pinch for time!Instructions 1.

Store for a week in therefrigerator, or up to 3 months in the freezer. To reheat, microwave or transferto a pot and cook over low heat, covered, until hot.Salmon Avocado BowlThis flavorful “rice” bowl is the perfect option if you want a lunch that reallysatisfies. It’s a bit similar to the burrito bowls you’ll find at popularMexican restaurants, but it’s significantly better for your health!Makes 1 bowlIngredients * 1 tsp avocado oil * 1 3-oz piece wild-caught salmon * 1 tsp Seafood Spice Rub [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sfsr] * 1 cup sautéed Cauliflower Rice [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bcr] * 1 cup Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh] * 1/4 avocado * 1 Tbsp minced cilantro or parsley * Juice of 1 lime * 2 Tbsp Nutty Green Salad Dressing [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#dressing2]Instructions 1.

My version is a mix of miracle noodles,cruciferous veggies, fresh herbs, and a gingery, creamy tahini-based dressing toexcite your taste buds.Makes 4 servingsIngredients * 3 packets Miracle Noodle fettuccine [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#pcmn], prepared the Gundry way and cooled * 1/2 head purple cabbage, thinly shredded * 1 cup broccoli slaw * 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced * 1/4 cup coconut aminos * 2 Tbsp rice wine vinegar * 2 Tbsp sesame oil * 2 Tbsp tahini * 3 cloves garlic, minced * Juice of 1 lemon * 1 tsp monkfruit sweetener or Swerve * 1/4 cup finely minced mint * 2 finely minced green onions * 2 Tbsp finely minced fresh ginger * 1/4 cup sesame seeds, for garnishInstructions 1.

Stir mint, green onions, and ginger into the dressing, then pour over the noodle mixture and toss. 4. Chill if you like, and serve garnished with sesame seeds.Meal Prep Notes: This can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up toa week. The ginger and garlic flavors will intensify, so if you’re not a fan ofthose flavors, feel free to leave them out of the dressing until the day you’reserving the salad.Collard-Wrapped Burritos (or Bowls)Here in SoCal, we LOVE our Mexican food, but the rice, beans, and tortillas canleave you feeling pretty weighed down, and leave your gut in bad shape too.These burritos—or bowls, if you want to keep things really easy—feature creamyguacamole, flavorful spiced “meat,” and even tangy fruit salsa, but no lectinsare needed.Makes 2 burritos or bowlsIngredients * 4 large collard greens leaves* * 1 bag Quorn Grounds or 2 cups shredded jackfruit * 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil * 1/2 tsp cumin * 1/2 tsp paprika * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/2 tsp sea salt * 1/2 cup cooked Cauliflower Rice [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bcr] * 1/4 cup Seasonal Fruit Salsa [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#fs] * 1/4 cup Guacamole [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#guac] * 1/4 cup coconut or goats yogurt*Use remaining collards for Garlicky Greens Soup [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#grsp]and trimmed stems for Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh]Instructions 1. For a bowl: Slice collard greens thinly and sauté along with Quorn in step 2. For a burrito: Carefully trim collard greens so the stems are no longer than the leaves. With a vegetable peeler, carefully shave down the thick ribs until thin. Bring a pan filled with water to a simmer. Carefully add leaves one at a time and simmer each for 1–2 minutes, until tender, then set aside; repeat with remaining leaves. 2. In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add Quorn or jackfruit, and sprinkle with cumin, paprika, pepper, and salt. Cook 3–5 minutes, until tender, then set aside. If making a burrito bowl, also sauté the collards in here. 3. If you like, heat the Cauliflower Rice in a pan or microwave. 4. Assemble a bowl: For each serving, place half of the cauliflower rice in the bottom of a bowl and add half of the Quorn or jackfruit mixture on top of it. Top each with fruit salsa, guacamole, and yogurt and serve. 5. Assemble a burrito: For each serving, lay out 2 collard leaves end to end, overlapping a bit. Carefully spread leaves with half of the cauliflower rice and half of the Quorn or jackfruit. Sprinkle half the salsa and guacamole over mixture, and drizzle on half the yogurt. Roll up carefully, folding in ends first, then rolling crosswise; repeat with second set of collards. Serve immediately.Meal Prep Notes: The components of this dish keep well separately so it’s easyto prepare in advance and assemble when you’re ready to eat.

I like storing mine in glass canning jars, which canactually go in the oven (uncovered, of course).To reheat, pop back in a 350°F oven and bake for 15–20 minutes or microwave(please note you’ll lose the crispy top if you reheat in the microwave).Lentil-Walnut CakesHeavily influenced by the flavors of my favorite vegetable samosas, theselentil-walnut cakes have subtle curry spicing and plenty of mushrooms formeatiness. This is a great use of pre-pressure-cooked lentils from your fridgeor Eden Brand canned lentils, which have been pressure-cooked. Think seriouslyabout doubling the recipe and freezing half (see notes).Makes 4 cakesIngredients * 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil * 1/2 red onion, coarsely chopped * 1 clove garlic * 1/2 cup fresh shiitake or crimini mushrooms, finely chopped (button mushrooms will work fine, too) * 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, minced * 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, minced * Zest and juice of 1 lemon * 3/4 tsp ground cumin * 1/2 tsp curry powder * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1 tsp sea salt * 1/2 cup chopped walnuts * 2 cups pressure-cooked lentils [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#pcbl]; or use Eden brand canned lentils) * 1 omega-3 egg or vegan egg substitute * 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed * 1/4–1/2 cup cassava flour * Nutty Green Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#ngs], to serveInstructions 1.

Bake for 15–20 minutes, then carefully flip, and bake for an additional 10. 9. Serve over Nutty Green Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#ngs], if you like.Meal Prep Notes: These patties freeze beautifully before cooking—simply makethem through step 8, then freeze them on a sheet tray. When frozen solid, stackthem in a freezer-proof container to save space. Then, when cooking them, bakeright from frozen—just give them a little extra time in the oven.One-Pan Chicken and VeggiesThis one-pan dish has all the flavors of classic roast chicken and veggies, butit comes together much more quickly—plus, you’ll only dirty one dish in thecooking process. I love making this with plenty of fresh rosemary, but thyme andparsley also work in a pinch.Makes 4 servingsIngredients * 1 whole pasture-raised chicken, or 4–6 pasture-raised bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs * 1 1/2 tsp sea salt, divided * 1/4 cup avocado oil * 1/4 cup fresh rosemary * 4 cloves garlic, minced * 2 cups broccoli florets * 1 cup cauliflower florets * 1 cup asparagus cut into bite-size pieces * 8–10 shallots, peeled and quartered * 1 lemon, thinly slicedInstructions 1.

After 15 minutes ofcooking, top with 2 sliced avocados or 1 pound tempeh, grilled or sautéed, andsliced (if on Phase 2 or 3). Let cook an additional 10 minutes, before serving.Braised Beef and MushroomsThink of this one as a cross between French boeuf bourguignon, and classic potroast. It’s tender, hearty, delicious, and actually gets more flavorful the nextday (perfect for leftovers). Serve this fancier dish over cooked millet orcauliflower rice, or, for a fancier occasion, spinach risotto.Makes 4 servingsIngredients * 1/2 pound grass-fed sirloin, cubed * 1 Tbsp cassava flour * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil * 1 large onion, diced * 2 ribs celery, minced * 3 cloves garlic, minced * 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and sliced * 1 Tbsp fresh thyme leaves * 1 Tbsp fresh rosemary, minced * 1 Tbsp Seafood Spice Rub [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sfsr] * 1 tsp sea salt * Zest of 1 lemon * 1/2 cup red wine* * 3/4 cup beef or vegetable broth * 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar * 4 cups Spinach Risotto [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#scr], Basic Cooked Millet [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#mil], or Cauliflower Rice [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bcr], for servingInstructions 1.

Add thyme, rosemary, the spice rub, sea salt, and lemon zest, and sauté an additional minute until rosemary softens, and the herbs smell very strong and delicious. 5. Deglaze the pot with wine, broth, and vinegar, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan to incorporate all the brown bits. 6. Reduce heat to low and simmer 25 to 45 minutes, until sauce is thickened, and beef is very tender. If sauce begins to evaporate too much, add water a little at a time. 7. Serve over spinach risotto, cooked millet, and cauliflower rice.Meal Prep Notes: This dish is better the next day—or even the day afterthat—which makes it great for entertaining. Store it in the fridge for 3–5 days,or portion and freeze for up to 3 months.Vegan Notes: Try replacing the beef in this recipe with grain-free tempeh, andcooking the same way—or just double the mushrooms.Sauces, Condiments, and SidesBasic Classic GuacamoleThis classic guacamole recipe is lectin-free because I left out the tomatoes,but it is super flavorful from the smoky cumin, fresh onions and garlic, andbright lime and cilantro. It’s not just addictive—it’s actually healthy.Makes 4 to 6 servingsIngredients * 2 ripe avocados, cut in half, pits removed * 1 jalapeno, peeled, seeded, and minced, or a shake of a hot sauce like Tabasco (optional) * 1 clove garlic, crushed * 1/2 red onion, minced * 1/4 cup cilantro or parsley, minced (your choice; I am one of those people for whom cilantro tastes like soap) * 1 tsp ground cumin * 1 tsp black pepper * 1 tsp sea salt * Juice of 2 limes (about 2 Tbsp)Instructions 1. Spoon avocado into a large bowl and crush with a potato masher. 2. Add remaining ingredients and fold to combine well. 3.

When youstore in the fridge, keep it in a narrow, airtight container and cover theexposed surface with a thin layer of olive or avocado oil to stave off browning.Basic PestoThere are a million ways to make classic pesto, but this is myfavorite—especially because it’s easy to make vegan when you want.Makes about 2 cupsIngredients * 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts (or toasted walnuts or blanched almonds) * 3 cloves garlic * 1 tsp sea salt * 3 cups fresh basil leaves, loosely packed * 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or 1/4 cup nutritional yeast * 3/4 cup top-quality extra virgin olive oilInstructions 1.

When combined, use immediately, or store according to instructions.Meal Prep Notes: Pesto keeps for up to a week in your fridge, cover the surfacewith a thin film of olive oil to prevent browning. You can also freeze up to 3months—I suggest transferring it into silicone ice trays then placing frozencubes in a BPA-safe freezer bag.Vegan Nut-Cheese SauceThis salty, rich “cheese” sauce is great for people who don’t eat dairy—orpeople who just want a healthier alternative to cheese. The raw nuts do need tobe soaked ahead of time, but it’s worth it—they blend up to a positively creamyconsistency. If you like a smoky flavor, try swapping the sweet paprika forsmoked, and adding a little ground cumin.Makes about 2 cupsIngredients * 2 cups raw macadamia nuts, soaked 4–10 hours in water * Zest of 1 lemon * Juice of 1 lemon * 1/4 cup nutritional yeast * 1 tsp sweet paprika * 1 tsp garlic powder * 1 tsp ground black pepper * 1 tsp onion powder * 1 teaspoon coconut aminos or sea saltInstructions 1.

When the mixture is creamy and smooth, taste, and adjust seasoning as needed. 5. Use immediately or store according to instructions.Meal Prep Notes: Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1week.Seasonal Fruit SalsaOne dish I really missed while eating lectin-free was classic pico de gallo. Myfavorite and easy alternative is this: a seasonal fruit salsa that mixes naturalsweetness with a little jalapeno heat. Just be sure to choose from only whateverhigh-polyphenol fruit is in season—like apples, berries, or peaches. Or make itwith jicama all year round.Makes 2 cupsIngredients * 3/4 cup diced seasonal fruit* or jicama * 1/4 cup minced cilantro * 1 diced avocado * 1 red onion, minced * 1 jalapeno, peeled, seeded, and minced, or a shake of a hot sauce like Tabasco (optional) * 2 cloves garlic, minced * 1 tsp sea salt * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil * 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar * Juice of 2 limes*Try apples or crispy pears in the late fall, early winter, citrus in thewinter, berries in the spring, and stone fruits like peaches and plums in thesummer. The possibilities are endless!Instructions 1. In a large bowl, toss together the fruit or jicama, cilantro, avocado, onion, jalapeno, garlic, and salt. Let rest for 5 minutes to draw out moisture. 2. Meanwhile, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Toss with fruit mixture. 3. Serve immediately or refrigerate.Meal Prep Notes: You can refrigerate this salsa for 3–5 days but note it doesnot freeze well. If you’ve got leftovers, try it over a piece of grilledwild-caught salmon, pasture-raised chicken, or on top of a salad. I also callfor it in the Taco Salad [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#qts] and the burritos[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bur]. Or just dip some plantain or taro root chips (seenote [Appendix.xhtml#apnote]) in it!Lentil-Walnut Cakes DressingThis rich, creamy dressing is inspired by some of the classic flavors of theMiddle East—herbs, lemon, and tahini, with a sweet balsamic twist.

Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan, and add onion. 2. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender. 3. Add cauliflower rice and salt and continue to cook for 5–7 minutes, until tender. Serve.Meal Prep Notes: You can do this 3–5 days ahead of time and store in therefrigerator or freezer. To reheat, microwave or heat in a sauté pan with alittle olive oil, and you’re good to go.Basic Cooked MilletCooking millet isn’t too different from cooking rice, but by toasting it first,you guarantee yourself an extra-delicious, slightly nutty-tasting side dish. Ascoop of this makes a nice, hearty base for my Braised Beef and Mushrooms[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#bbm] or Pressure-Cooked Lentil Chili[Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#lc].Makes 3 to 4 cupsIngredients * 1 1/2 cups millet * 3 cups broth or water * 1/4 tsp sea saltInstructions 1. Add millet to the bottom of a large, dry pot, and heat on medium, tossing occasionally to toast. 2. When millet smells golden brown and nutty, add broth or water and salt to the pan. 3. Bring liquid to a boil, then reduce heat until the water is barely simmering. 4. Let simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from heat. 5. Let millet stand, covered, for about 10 minutes to absorb additional liquid, then fluff with a fork before serving.Meal Prep Notes: You can store in refrigerator for 3–5 days or freeze up to 3months. It’s always handy to have in the freezer, since it reheats so quickly.To reheat cooked millet, just warm it in the microwave with a bit of water.Pressure-Cooked Beans and LentilsThe pressure cooker is such an easy way to destroy the lectins in beans andlentils—it’s a fun thing to experiment with in Phase 3. This basic recipe is afantastic, simple, satisfying treat. Feel free to get creative with theseasoning once you’re comfortable with pressure-cooking. I suggest adding infresh herbs, garlic, or citrus zest.Makes 6 servingsIngredients * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil * 1 large yellow onion, diced * 1/2 tsp ground cumin * 1/2 tsp garlic powder * 1/2 teaspoon paprika * 1/2 tsp sea salt * 6 cups water, broth, or chicken stock * 2 cups dried beans or lentils, rinsed and picked throughInstructions (Stove Top Pressure Cooker) 1. In a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium-high heat on the stove. 2. When oil is hot, add the onion, cumin, garlic powder, paprika, and salt and cook, stirring frequently until onions are tender. 3. Add the water or broth and beans or lentils, and lock lid in place. 4. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 30 minutes for beans, 20 minutes for lentils. 5. Once time is up, allow the pressure to come down naturally, about 15 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow the steam to escape.Instructions (Electric Pressure Cooker, like Instant Pot) 1. In a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker, heat the oil on the sauté setting. 2. When oil is hot, add the onion, cumin, garlic powder, paprika, and salt and cook, stirring frequently until onions are tender. 3. Add the water and beans or lentils, and lock lid in place. 4. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes for beans or 20 minutes for lentils. 5. Release the pressure according to the manufacturer of your pressure cooker.Seafood Spice RubI call this a “seafood” spice rub since I started making it for salmon andshrimp, but turns out it’s good on just about everything. It quickly became mygo-to seasoning for chicken, grass-fed pork, shellfish, and even veggies. Thisversatile blend is also good on kale chips, eggs, or sprinkled on soup.Makes 1/2 cupIngredients * 2 Tbsp sea salt * 2 Tbsp paprika * 1 Tbsp cumin * 1 Tbsp garlic powder * 2 tsp black pepper * 1 1/2 tsp onion powder * 1 tsp curry powder * 1/2 tsp cinnamon * 1/2 tsp clovesInstructions 1. Place all ingredients into a jar and shake to combine. 2. Store at room temperature in airtight jar and use as needed—shake before use.Meal Prep Notes: Keeps at room temperature for up to 6 months.SnacksCrispy ArtichokesNot only are these a great salad topper, but these crunchy, salty treats arealso a really good snack, especially if you’ve got a craving for potato chips orfrench fries. Try serving to friends with a glass of wine before dinner.Makes 4 servingsIngredients * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil * 2 cups frozen and thawed artichoke hearts, quartered (rinsed canned ones are fine, too) * 1/4 cup cassava flour * 1 tsp sea salt * 1 tsp freshly ground pepperInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush a sheet tray with some of the olive oil. 2. If using frozen artichokes, make sure they are thoroughly thawed. Dry artichokes in a salad spinner, then pat dry between layers of paper towels. 3. Mix together cassava flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish or bowl. When artichokes are completely dry, toss in the flour mixture until evenly coated. 4. Spread onto prepared sheet tray and drizzle with remaining oil. 5. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. 6. Serve immediately, or store and reheat according to instructions.Meal Prep Notes: While these are most delicious when fresh, any leftovers can bestored in the freezer for up to 2 months. When you want to use them, just spraythe frozen artichokes with a bit of oil and pop them onto a sheet tray, and bakeat 400°F for 10–15 minutes.Kale ChipsThis heavily spiced kale chip recipe is great for people who crave crunchy,salty foods, and are having trouble saying goodbye to chips. Try dipping thesekale chips in guacamole, pesto, or your favorite dressing for the full “chipsand dip” experience.Makes 4 servingsIngredients * 1 large bunch curly kale (purple or green are OK) * 2 Tbsp avocado oil * 1 tsp Seafood Spice Rub [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#sfsr] * 1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 275°F. 2. Rinse kale and pat dry. Remove thick stems* and tear the leaf into 2–3–inch pieces. 3. Pat dry a second time (just in case) or use a salad spinner, then toss in a bowl with the oil. 4. Sprinkle on seasonings and toss again, until leaves are evenly coated. 5. Spread kale in a single layer (which may require 2 to 3 baking sheets); do not overcrowd the pans. 6. Bake 15 minutes, then lightly toss to ensure all sides of the kale gets baked. 7. Bake an additional 10–15 minutes, until golden brown around the edges. 8. Leave the chips to cool—they should crisp up even more as they cool.*Save stems for the Green Veggie Hash [Chapter_8_Recipes.xhtml#gvh].Meal Prep Notes: These chips will keep 2–3 days at room temperature in anairtight container—just let them cool completely before storing. If they get alittle soggy, re-crisp them in the oven.Nut Mix 3.0My nut mix has been a hit in all of my books, and if you find yourself hungry,it’s an ideal grab-and-go snack. It’s flavorful, satisfying, and filling, plusthe mix of herbs, garlic, and salt give it the evocative taste of junk food,while boosting your health. I make sure to always have some around because it’sjust that handy as a snack.Makes 12 to 15 servingsIngredients * 2 cups raw walnuts * 1 cup raw pecans * 1/2 cup raw macadamia nuts * 1/2 cup raw pine nuts * 2 Tbsp walnut oil * 4 cloves garlic, minced * 2 Tbsp minced fresh rosemary * 1 Tbsp minced fresh sage * 1 tsp fresh thyme * 1 tsp iodized sea saltInstructions 1. Combine nuts in a large heatproof bowl and set aside. 2. Heat oil in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add garlic, rosemary, sage, and thyme, and cook until very fragrant, 2–3 minutes. 3. Remove from heat, and pour oil mixture over nut mix immediately, along with sea salt. 4. Toss to combine, and let cool to room temperature before serving.Meal Prep Notes: This mix keeps beautifully in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Youcan also freeze it for up to 6 months.Avocado Cloud BreadI love everything bagels, but as we all know, they’re lectin bombs. This cloud“bread” is not only the perfect bagel substitute, complete with the seasoning ontop, but it’s also great if you want a little something to dip in your chili orto eat with your salad. You can even use it to make sandwiches!Makes 12 bunsIngredients * 4 omega-3 or pastured eggs, separated * 1/4 tsp cream of tartar * 1/2 ripe avocado, mashed * 1/8 tsp salt * 1 tsp everything-bagel seasoning, poppy seeds, or sesame seedsInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicon mat, and set aside. 2. In a large stand mixer or a bowl with a hand mixer, whip together egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form, about 3–4 minutes. 3. In a separate bowl, whip together egg yolks, avocado, and salt until smooth. You should be able to do this in a bowl with a whisk or with a hand mixer. 4. Whisk 1/4 of the egg-white mixture into the avocado mixture to lighten it. Then, carefully fold the remaining egg whites into the avocado mixture until smooth. 5. Spoon quarter-cup dollops of the mixture onto your prepared baking sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart. Sprinkle with the topping of your choice and bake until golden and firm, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately or store according to instructions.Meal Prep Notes: These keep in the fridge for 1–2 days, and in the freezer in aBPA-free freezer bag for up to 2 weeks. To thaw, just heat them gently in a300-degree oven (or toaster oven) until warm.Vegan Notes: To make this vegan, use aquafaba—the liquid found in a can ofcooked chickpeas—instead of eggs. Make sure to use only Eden brand, whichpressure-cooks their beans, so they are lectin-free. You’ll need about 1/2 cupof aquafaba, so approximately 1 can’s worth. Use that 1/2 cup instead of eggwhites in Step 2—they’ll whip just the same. Then, instead of using egg yolks inStep 3, whip 3 tablespoons of avocado oil in with your avocado. Proceed with therest of the recipe as written.Chocolate Coconut Ice PopsI’ll be honest: ice cream has always been one of my favorite indulgences—but ittakes a while to make. These ice pops, however, come together in minutes (notcounting freezer time) and are like a vacation for your taste buds, thanks tothe tropical coconut flavor. If you are on Phase 2, just omit the coconut oil.Makes 6–8 popsIngredients * 2 cans full-fat coconut milk * 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut * 10–12 drops liquid stevia * 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao or higher to be keto-compliant) * 1 Tbsp coconut oil (optional)Instructions 1. Stir together the coconut milk, shredded coconut, and stevia in a large saucepan over low heat. 2. Add 3/4 of the chocolate to the pan, and continue to stir until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. 3. Taste, add more sweetener if needed, then carefully pour mixture into BPA-free popsicle molds.* 4. Freeze until frozen solid, at least 3 hours. 5. Before serving, melt together the remaining chocolate and the coconut oil in a microwave or small saucepan over low heat and set aside. 6. Unmold pops and drizzle with chocolate mixture.*No popsicle molds? Use paper Dixie cups and food-safe craft sticks—simply covereach cup with foil, poke a hole into it, and set the stick into the hole to keepit upright and in place.Simple Chocolate Snack CakeHow can a slice of moist, decadent, chocolate cake get any better? Make it achocolate cake you can enjoy totally guilt free. And that’s what makes thischocolate snack cake so amazing. Eat it plain, or drizzle it with a littlecoconut cream if you need something really over the top.Makes 1 8-inch round cakeIngredients * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing pan * 1 cup blanched almond flour * 2/3 cup erythritol or Swerve * 1/4 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder * 1 tsp aluminum-free baking powder * 1/2 tsp iodized sea salt * 3 Omega-3 or pastured eggs or egg replacer equivalent * 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut cream * 2 Tbsp bittersweet chocolate (at least 70% cacao) * 1 tsp vanilla extractInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 8\" cake tin with olive oil and set aside. 2. In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, erythritol, cocoa powder, baking powder, and sea salt. 3. In another bowl or a large measuring cup, combine the eggs (or egg replacement) and coconut cream. 4. In the microwave or over a double boiler, melt together the chocolate, oil, and vanilla, stirring frequently. When smooth, let cool a minute, then add to the coconut cream mixture. 5. Gradually add wet ingredients to dry, whisking until you’ve made a smooth batter. Keep whisking 2–3 minutes, until mixture becomes a little fluffy. 6. Pour into prepared cake pan, and bake for 25–35 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. 7. Let cool to room temperature before unmolding and serving.Meal Prep Notes: This cake keeps covered on the counter for up to a week—thoughI doubt it’ll last that long!Spice CookiesI’ve always thought spice cookies—with the warm heady flavors of cinnamon,cloves, and nutmeg—tasted a little like Christmas. And let’s face it, we allneed an unexpected holiday from time to time. I always keep this cookie dough inmy freezer. That way, I can bake up what I need exactly when I’m craving it. Ifyou are in Phase 2, use butter or almond/macadamia butter, not coconut oil.Makes 12 cookiesIngredients * 1 cup toasted walnuts * 1/2 tsp nutmeg * 1/2 tsp cinnamon * 1/8 tsp cloves * 1/2 cup erythritol or monkfruit sweetener * 1/4 cup coconut flour * 1/4 cup room-temperature grass-fed butter, cut into chunks, or coconut oil (phase 3 only; see Vegan Note below) * 1/2 tsp almond extract * 1/2 tsp vanilla extract * 1/4 tsp sea saltInstructions 1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside. 2. In a food processor fitted with an S blade, pulse together the walnuts, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves, until finely ground. Add the erythritol and coconut flour, and pulse again until fully combined. 3. Add the butter or oil to the food processor, along with extracts and sea salt. Pulse until a soft dough is formed. 4. Roll the dough into 12 equal balls. To bake, flatten 6 balls onto each cookie sheet, in 3 rows of 2. 5. Bake 12–15 minutes, then let cool for at least 20 minutes, or the cookies will fall apart. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. 6. Eat or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2–3 days.Meal Prep Notes: While these cookies, when baked, keep for only 2–3 days, theraw dough keeps in the freezer for months. All you need to do is roll the doughinto balls, flatten slightly on a cookie sheet, and freeze until solid. Thentransfer to an airtight container until needed. You can bake from frozen, justadd a couple of extra minutes in the oven as necessary. That way, you’ve got afresh cookie (or completely edible raw cookie dough) on hand whenever you needit!Vegan Notes: If you are in Phase 2, replace the butter/coconut oil with almondor macadamia butter.Phase 1 Recipes:BREAKFAST• Breakfast Salad• Green Ginger Smoothies• Green Veggie HashLUNCH• Nutty Green Salad• Sage and Mushroom Soup• Salmon Avocado BowlDINNER• One-Pan Chicken and Veggies• Spinach Cauliflower “Risotto”• Quorn Taco SaladDESSERTS/SNACKS• Kale Chips• Nut Mix 3.0SAUCES, CONDIMENTS, AND SIDES• Basic Pesto• Basic Sautéed Cauliflower Rice• Breakfast Salad Dressing• Guacamole (make without jalapenos until Phase 3)• Lentil-Walnut Cakes Dressing• Nutty Greens Salad Dressing• Seafood Spice Rub• Taco Salad Dressing• Vegan Nut-Cheese SaucePhase 2 and 3 Recipes (Plus All of Phase 1 Recipes):BREAKFAST• Almond Joy Muffins (use avocado oil variation if in Phase 2)• Baked Avocado Egg Cups with Basic Pesto• Green Egg MuffinsLUNCH• Sesame Miracle Noodle Salad• Collard-Wrapped Burritos• Millet Buddha Bowl• Pasture-Raised Chicken SaladDINNER• Braised Beef and Mushrooms• Garlicky Greens Soup• Lentil-Walnut Cakes (Phase 3 only)• Miracle Noodle Veggie Bake• Pressure-Cooked Lentil Chili (Phase 3 only)• Wild-Caught Shrimp RisottoDESSERTS/SNACKS• Chocolate Coconut Ice Pops (for Phase 2, omit coconut oil)• Simple Chocolate Cake• Spice Cookies (for Phase 2, use butter or almond/macadamia butter variation)• Avocado Cloud Bread• Crispy ArtichokesSAUCES, CONDIMENTS, AND SIDES• Basic Cooked Millet• Precooked Miracle Noodles• Pressure-Cooked Beans/Lentils (Phase 2 if you are vegetarian/vegan, Phase 3otherwise)• Seasonal Fruit Salsa"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [nav.xhtml#nac13]My sincere thanks go to Elinor Hutton, who was able to take my very lengthyprose and writing style and make it approachable and readable.

GI wanted to take the opportunity in this book to answer some of the mostfrequently asked questions I receive in person and online about the PlantParadox program. This is just a selection of some of the common inquiries I get.If you have a question for me that I don’t answer in the pages that follow,please reach out and ask in our #PlantParadox30 community!What are your thoughts on gluten-free diets? How is the Plant Paradox programdifferent?So many of my autoimmune patients and my irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patientshave already gone gluten free, and yes, many have noticed a difference, but arenot yet fully healed. Gluten is a lectin, but in the scheme of things, arelatively minor one. And the downside of gluten-free diets is that processed,gluten-free foods are typically loaded with other lectins, many of whichresemble and act like gluten on our intestinal wall and to our immune system. Sogluten-free diets usually mean that they are lectin loaded!I love spicy food. Is there a hot sauce that is acceptable?Most hot sauces, like Tabasco sauce for instance, are made from fermentedpeppers. Since the fermentation process neutralizes many of the lectins inpeppers, it is safe to eat. Also most chile powders, like cayenne or New Mexicoground chile pepper, are made from the flesh of the peppers with the peels andseeds removed. But when in doubt, cut it out. There are plenty of otheringredients with pungent flavors that are safe to eat, like regular black pepper(not a pepper at all), horseradish, wasabi (a cousin of horseradish), ginger,and mustard.What happens if I drink more than the allotted alcohol amount?Sadly, daily consumption of more than 6 ounces of wine in women and 12 ounces inmen has been shown to increase blood pressure and is responsible for damagingthe gut lining just like lectins do. In addition, alcohol of any type loosensinhibitions, which usually leads not only to consuming more alcohol, but alsomore eating the wrong foods. For many of my patients, a simple solution is tofollow the one-glass-a-day rule during the week, and follow a two-glass rule onFriday and Saturday. Or why not have wine spritzers with San Pellegrino andextend your drinking pleasure?Is rosé OK instead of red wine?I realize that for my Chardonnay drinkers on the program, asking you to drinkred wine may be hard to swallow. Many aren’t used to the lack of sugar, and thetannins in red wine bother some people. But the reason to drink red wine is todeliver polyphenols into you and your gut bugs. Sadly, most white wines don’thave many polyphenols. Rosé wine does have polyphenols, though simply not asmany as red wine. But hey, if I can get you to back off on the white stuff, havea glass of rosé. But please, no White Zinfandel!Why is organic sour cream/heavy cream/cream cheese OK, but organic milk or othercheeses are not?Organic sour cream, heavy cream, and cream cheese are all nearly devoid ofcasein A1, one of the two proteins in cow’s milk (the other is whey). Whilecasein A2 is perfectly safe, most cows in North America, and the world for thatmatter, make casein A1, a lectin-like protein that is responsible for manypeople’s trouble with milk. Because sour cream, heavy cream, and cream cheesehave little if any casein, organic versions should be safe to use sparingly.Is there a limit to the number of energy bars I can eat?That answer is simple: yes! Most of the approved energy bars contain about 20grams of animal protein per bar, which is roughly the total amount of proteinyou require in an entire day. Also, beware of plant-based protein bars, whichtend to be made with soy, rice, or pea proteins, making them true lectin bombsdisguised as health bars.What about coffee? In which phases is it allowed and is there a limit?Coffee is allowed in all phases. Quite frankly, it may be one of the greatesthealth foods ever. Coffee raises levels of a chemical known as brain-derivedneurotrophic factor (BDNF), which stimulates the growth of new brain cells andhas positively correlated with longevity. Moreover, recent studies have clearedcoffee and its caffeine from any association with causing skipped heartbeats oratrial fibrillation. Everyone is a little bit different when it comes to theircaffeine tolerance, so just try to consume in moderation. If regular coffeegives you the jitters, switch to decaf.Are raw vegetables better for my gut than cooked?It depends. I eat about 80 percent of my food raw and have for many years.However, in my practice, I see so many people for IBS, leaky gut, Crohn’sdisease, and ulcerative colitis, conditions where even the good lectins (yes,there are good lectins) in dark-green vegetables like kale and other cruciferousveggies initially wreak havoc on these folks’ guts. If you are trying out thePlant Paradox and suffer from one of these conditions, cook these vegetables tomush before eating them, at least initially. As time progresses and your gutheals, you may be able to enjoy them raw as well.Are there any store-bought chips or crackers that work in Phase 1 or 2?You can eat nori sheets in Phase 1, but watch out for most seaweed “chips,” asthey are usually fried in unacceptable oils like canola oil. Fried plantain ortaro root chips are fine in Phase 2, but make sure they are cooked in palm,coconut, or avocado oils. Also allowable in Phase 2 are coconut chips and sweetpotato chips cooked in coconut oil—check for them at Whole Foods. As of yet, nocrackers have made the safe list.Is there any acceptable milk or alternative milk I can use in my coffee in Phase1?Yes, you can use coconut, almond, or hemp milk in your coffee, but please useonly the unsweetened varieties.Since miso is made of soybeans or other legumes, why is it acceptable on thePlant Paradox?In general, fermentation uses bacterial and/or yeast digestion of the sugars andproteins in beans and grains to degrade lectins. Many cultures that consumelarge quantities of brans and grains rely on fermentation as a cooking process,such as with miso and natto in Japan and tempeh in Indonesia. Even in the UnitedStates, until a few decades ago, all breads were made from yeast and/orsourdough starters and thus were fermented foods.Are there any dangers in using a microwave? Any tips to making it safer?I am not a fan of microwaves, and, in fact, we don’t have a built-in microwavein our home. Having said that, years ago, as I was designing the meal plans thateventually became the Plant Paradox, one of my patients—who credits me withreversing his then-horrible coronary artery disease, avoiding planned bypasssurgery—and I were talking about his company, which makes stevia-sweetened softdrinks. I was suggesting to him that although stevia was safe from a sweetenerstandpoint, that the sweet taste would still fool the brain and cause weightgain. He replied that people are still going to drink soft drinks, at least hiswouldn’t kill them like the others. At that, I told him that I had designed anumber of muffin recipes that could be mixed together in a coffee mug with greatingredients like coconut and almond flours, and could be made in a microwave athome or work in about a minute, but I was concerned about the microwave. Hisreply was right in line with one of my fundamental teachings: Do what you canwith what you’ve got, wherever you are. What he said was, “Hey, you’ve got anextremely healthy alternative to the poisons that people eat for breakfast andsnacks, and you are going to worry about a minute of heat in a microwave anddeny them because of that?” And he was exactly right! Enjoy the muffins. Havingsaid that, remember to use ceramic or glass in a microwave, and no, don’t cookdinners in it for twenty minutes, okay?Is eating more than one avocado a day not good for you?Have as many as you want. There is at least one human study that an avocado aday promotes weight loss, and multiple studies show that avocados help your bodyabsorb the polyphenols (beneficial plant compounds) in your foods.Why are you not allowed to have coconut oil until Phase 3?One of the main drivers of inflammation is the presence of lipopolysaccharides(LPSs) in your body. While leaky gut can allow LPSs direct access through theintestinal wall, LPSs generally hitch a ride on large fat-carrying moleculescalled chylomicrons. Long-chain saturated fats that are present in coconut oil,in particular, are transported across the gut wall by chylomicrons, whilemedium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) do not use this system to be absorbed. Ofinterest, fish oil and other long-chain Omega 3 fats, actually prevent LPSs fromhopping on board chylomicrons. Once you’ve got inflammation under control in afew weeks, you can start using some coconut oil, with the proviso that if youcarry the ApoE4 gene, you are better off limiting this fat.What are the limits with resistant starches? How do these come into play inPhase 3?Early on, when I was developing the “Yes, Please” food list, a lot of patientsthought that resistant starches were essentially free foods; in other words youcan have as much as you want. But, a resistant starch is still a starch, andmost of it will still be converted to sugar. Luckily, depending on how it’scooked and then cooled and reheated, some of it will be available for digestionby your good bugs. Especially early in the program, just remember that theseare, in general, maybe once or twice a week additions to your program. Yearsago, I remember one frustrated patient whose blood work was improvingdramatically in terms of inflammation markers, but he wasn’t losing an ounce ofweight. When I looked at his food diary, the culprit was obvious: He was havingplantain pancakes with breakfast, lunch, and dinner! A simple adjustment, andoff fell the weight.Should I not rely on Miracle Noodles and Miracle Rice too much?Miracle Noodles, Miracle Rice, and other forms of glucomannan-based noodles openup multiple possibilities for getting greens and other veggies with olive oilinto your mouth, and so their intake is unlimited. You literally cannot eatenough to gain weight as they are mainly water with a gut-bug-feeding starchthat you cannot digest.Can you consume too much of the healthy oils?Don’t start having a liter of olive oil per week early in the program, like theydo in many countries of the Mediterranean. For one thing, LPSs can still hop onolive oil chylomicrons, just not as easily as they can with coconut oil. But,eventually, don’t be afraid of too much olive oil. A five-year study of seniorsin Spain compared an isocaloric (meaning each group ate the same calories)low-fat Mediterranean diet to a Mediterranean diet that included the consumptionof a liter of olive oil per week or the equivalent amount of walnuts. Theresults showed that the olive oil and walnut groups lost weight while thelow-fat group actually gained weight over five years. The olive oil group alsohad decreased memory loss and lessened breast cancer and heart disease risk. Soenjoy your nuts and olive oil!Are your lists of fish and shellfish all-inclusive? My favorite isn’t on youracceptable list for the regular Plant Paradox or the Keto Plant ParadoxIntensive Care Program. Can I still eat it?If it’s wild caught, eat it. But really limit the amount of sashimi-grade tuna,swordfish, tile fish, and grouper that you consume, due to their high mercuryand other PCP levels. Also, if it says “organic,” it’s not wild caught, it’sfarm raised on “organic” grains and soy. You can’t follow a salmon around to seeif it’s eating organically!Do you have a favorite vegetarian/vegan egg replacement?The best is Bob’s Red Mill Egg Replacer, or Orgran No Egg Egg Replacer. Both doinclude potato starch, but potato starch doesn’t contain lectins. To get reallytechnical, potato is an RS2 starch, while RS3 starches are better at feedingyour gut buddies.Are there any dangers or things to watch out for when having my child on thePlant Paradox program? Is there a minimum age for them to participate?The Plant Paradox program is great for children of all ages once they’re eatingsolid food. My two grandchildren, ages two and four, are thriving on it. There’sno minimum age.Should my child skip the first week (Phase 1/cleanse) of the 30-day plan?Yes, there’s really no need for them to do this part unless they already haveissues with pre-diabetes or diabetes.Is intermittent fasting safe for my child?There is no need for intermittent fasting for children, though I do recommendlimiting snacking between meals, which is a modern convenience-food invention.If they really need a snack, go for nuts, celery, or guacamole.What, if any, supplements should my child be taking if on the program?Most children should take vitamin D3 and quality fish oil; surprisingly,Carlson’s cod liver oil has no fishy taste.How much oil should I aim to ingest at the height of the Keto Plant ParadoxIntensive Care Program?Very good human studies have shown that a liter of olive oil per week has brain,heart, and anticancer properties. That may sound like a lot, and it is, but tryto work up to about 12 tablespoons a day. But, please, go slowly—if you startusing that much initially, you may find yourself visiting the toilet more thanyou would like.Do you have any tips for going out to eat? Best cuisines? Ordering strategy?I have always said that I can literally go to any restaurant and eat safely. Myold friend Tom Guy used to say that the only thing the menu tells you is whatingredients the chef has in the back! And he’s right. Scan the options, if theasparagus is served with the beef, and not the wild shrimp, well, you know whatto do: Ask them to serve it with the shrimp. If they won’t make changes, tellthem you will be more than happy to change restaurants. Worried that the salmonor beef or chicken isn’t wild or grass-fed or pastured? You will not starvewithout that protein that night. Enjoy a safe salad and two sides of vegetablesand I guarantee you will leave there stuffed and better off for the experience.What can I do about blue light?Blue light is ubiquitous in our societies now. Interestingly, old incandescentbulbs, oil lamps, gas lamps, and fireplaces are poor sources of blue light andwere the major sources of nighttime lighting for generations. Now fluorescent,xenon, and LED bulbs are the norm, and all generate massive amounts of bluelight, as do all your personal devices and TV screens. Make sure you have yournighttime mode turned on while using your handhelds and laptops at night. But,the easiest trick is to wear blue blocking glasses at night while watching TV oronline. They are cheap, many models fit over glasses, and a lot of the modelsmake you look like Bono from U2!"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [nav.xhtml#nab15]Steven R.
